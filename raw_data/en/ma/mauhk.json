Tile of Thesis The Charter and Public Education: The Transformation of Canadian Legal Culture Thh di~~ertatian explores the pracess through which democratic rights, promulgated in a ccmtitutirmal charter, can become a living and growing part of a legal cuiwe, and thrcrvrgh that culture, a vital part of wial reality. More specifically, the dissertation examines the manner in which an expansion and diffusion of crsnsrinttional sights in selected areas of Canadian education have affected the broader pattern of Canadian legal development. For example, have Canadian legal traditions which evolved in tbe pre-Cltarter era. been reinforced or fundamentally altered by the Charter of R&ks and Freedoms? Beyond the obvious changes in Canada% legal architecture and rhetoric after 1982, in what way has the country's legal culture been transformed? Have Canadians become more \"rights colKCious\" since the entrenchment of a constitutional charter, aad if so, with what impact on the Canadian public education spern? The conceptual framework elaborated in the first chapter of the dissertation utilizes the concept of legal culture as a comparative analytical tool for studying rights consciousness and corkstitutional development in Canada following the adoption of the Chmer. The major analytical chapters of the dissertation are case studies focusing on constitutional developments in various spheres of public education. Each of the four case studies -- vetting salient rights and k@ issues currently relevant to the Canadian ~~hod community - -explores hnge d cmtimrity in Canada's legal The case studies focus upon: (1) equal educ;ttioaal qportunides for children with &abilities; (23 *~fachen and the AIDS crisis; (3) gender equality in the *Is, and; (4) the IG!~ of religion in the public school curriculum. The Final chapter reviews rhe major findings presented in the tour case studies, and explores some implications of those findings for the evolution of Canadian education and legal culture.

This is not a statute or even a statute of the extraordinary nature of the Canadian Bill of Rights ...+ It is part of the Constitution of the nation adopted by the constitutional process ,... The Charter comes from neither level of the legis?ative branches of government but from the Constitution itself. It is part sf the fabric of Canadian law. Indeed, it is the supreme law of Canada' In the same ruling, the Court asserted that the Chatter would be accorded broad and generous judicial interpretation in order \"to better serve\" the Canadian community which \"it is designed to guide ... for a long time.\" Anything less, the Court cautioned, would \"stunt the growth of the law and hence the community it serves.\" Eew areas of Canadian society appear to have been as deeply affected by the Charter as; the field of public education. In the short span of the new constitution's existence, education has rapidly become the focus of several important legal challenges and judicial dedsions. The manner in whicb the Chmrer has impacted on educational policies and practices ha5 important consequences for both rhc school community and Canadian society more brmdfy. In the United States, for example, constitutional decisions concerning educational isues frequently have been the catalyst for broad-ranging public poliq debates having important repercus~inm on the evolution of public education. As one American mnrtitutiad scholar hds pointed out: \"Schools, by the nature of the enterprise and the immediacy af the impact of educational policies on large numbers of persons of disparate backgrounds, have been the focus of a significanr share of (U.S.) Supreme Court opinions on social issues,\"3 This dissertation seeks to explore the process by which democratic rights, pf~m~lgated in a constitutional charter may become a living and growing part of the legal culture. and through that culture, a vital part of social reality, The dissertation will also examine haw the expansion and diffusion of rights in various selected areas of public education have affected broader patterns of constitutional growth and cbange. Has the Charter of Rt@m and F* reinforced or reformed Canadian legal traditions? Beyond obvious changes in C&s legal ilr-chitecnue and rhetoric, in what way has the country's legal culture been transformed? Have Canadians become more \"rights coIISCjOUSw since the entrenchment of a constitutional charter? The research design elaborated in the first chapter of the dissertation will ut. the concept of \"legal culture\" as a comparative anatytical tool for studying rights consciousness and constitutional dwelqnnent in Canada since the adaption of the Ckmrer in Tbe on a)nstitutionaf dwciopmrrrts in rhe field of ducaition as a means to explore change and cantinuity in the Canadian legal culture.

Thus, several scholars have absented that there is an \"embarrassing paucity of knowledge\" regarding the relatianship of law to society, and that many basic questions concerning the interaction between legal change and soda1 change are 'completely neglected.\" Moreover, while some anafvsts emphasize that tbe evolution and dynamics of a society are largely dependent on the nature af tbe legal system and the administration of laws, others view the legal system ' SOC, fa example, Lamll~e M.

Despite the controversy about tbe nature of the nexus between law and social change, and despite the cansiderablt methodological difficulties in studying that relationship, the problem of unravelling the connection between legal systems and society continues to be a highly significant reatm of social inquiry. This dissertation will examine the impact of legal change, and in particular the impact of constitutional change, on the evolution of the Canadian educatiod system, and thereby on Canadian society more generally. Four issue areas which have been important in the recent development of Canadian educational policy and practice - (1) equal educational opportunities for disabled children, (2) teachers and the AIDS crisis, and (3) gender equality in the schools, and (4) the role of religion in the public school curricuium - will provide case studies to examine the relationship between legal and educational development, The manner in which the Charter has impacted on educational policy-making and practice has important consequences for both the school community and Canadian society more generall!. For example, in the United States, constitutional decisions concerning educational issues frequently have been the catdyst for broad-ranging public policy debates having important repercussions on the evolution of public education As one American c~rtstitutional scholar has pointed out: \"Schools, by the nature of the enterprise and the hmediacy of the impact of educational policies on large numbers of persons of disparate twchgrouods, bave been the focus of a significant share of (U.S1) Supreme Court opinions on -a1 i~sues.\"'~ In order to better understand the factors which affect the relationship between law and society, both generally and in the Canadian context, this first chapter of the dissertation will focus on theoretical and conceptual issues pertaining to the dynamic connection between legal development and societal change. Three particular topics addressed in the theoretical- conceptual literature are especial!y crucial to consider before turning to the case study portion of the dissertation. The topics are: (1) the components of legal systems; (2) the definition and dimensions of legal cultures, and; (3) the phenomena of rights consciousness and legal character. 11. LEGAL SYSTEMS It is a commonplace that the nature and operation of legal systems vary significantly with the historical and evolutionary context in which they are developed. Focusing on such variants, scholars have usual& differentiated between a number of major legal traditions or \"families of law\" (such as the Anglo-American common law tradition, the Rornano-Germanic civil law tradition, the socialist law tradition, Moslem law, Hindu law, Jewish law, and canon law, etc-). Each family of law is characterized by a number of common traits. Legal systems generally associated with Western societies, for example, are all notable for the putative paramountcy of the rule of law, due process of law, and the independence of the judiciary, 3 E Reutter, ?7ze Supreme -5 Impm on Public f%xazion (U.S.: National organization of Legal Problem in Education, 1982), pj~ 1-2 and so on. However, individual legal systems (e.g., the British, French Canadian, and American legal system), falling within a specific \"family\" and sharing various common features, also exhibit certain unique characteristics which are reflected in a society's laws, legal institutions, and mores. Given the complexity and diversity of legal systems, many different concepts, analytical frameworks, and methodologies have been elaborated to examine the dynamics of a society's legal structure and traditions. This is particularly true with respect to analyses concerning the impact of changing social attitudes and behaviour on legal systems. Lawrence Friedman, who has developed a particularly important and useful model for examining the operation and dynamics of legal systems has observed, for example, that \"there are many ... ways of looking at legal systems and their relationship to the larger society, and many hybrid views. Most of them rest on observations that are undeniably true in part. Ihe various theories simply assume different conceptions of the legal system.\"' In his seminal work on law and social change, Friedman identifies three major constituent elements mmmon to all legal systems: (1) structural components; (2) substantive components, and; (3) cultural mmponents. The \"structuralu aspect of a legal system refers to its legal institutions, including the forms they take and the processes that they perform (e-g., the administration of justice, the constitution, federalism, division of B(pwets, etc.). Friedman descn'bes the second ekrnent of the legal system as the \"substantiveu component, or the \"output side\" of the legal system. This element includes the aauaI faws of a legal system, that is, the rules, principles, docuines, case law, statutes, and so on. The third element in the legal system is discussed by Friedman in terms of a \"cultural\" component. This aspect of the legal system. which can be termed the \"legal culture,\" describes the values and attitudes which bind the system together, and which determine the place of the legal system in the culture of the society as a whole. According to Friedman's view of the legal system, how these three elements interact with each other, how they are influenced by external societal demands and pressures, and how they, in turn, influence legal behaviour, shape the actual \"living law\" of a society? &fore turning in the next chapter to a discussion of the recent interaction of these three elements within the Canadian legal system and Canadian society, it is profitable to examine in more detail the concept of \"legal culturew elaborated by Friedman and others. 111. LEGAL CULTURE For most legal scholars, the operation and viability of legal systems are closely related to citizens' views about law, justiee and tbe legal authorities, or what has been termed the legal culture.\" Analysts, howewer, have defined and disd the concept of legal culture from a rmmber of differing persQectivs- For some authors legal culture should be defined '&id-p.34. Fritdmanexpndsootbeseidwin,ThcLcgolSystem.ASocLdScienn Pmpeaive (New York: RUM Sage Foundation, 1975), see cspady Chapter 1- For other more recent studies by Friedman on tbe subm of legal culture see, 'CRK Concept of Self in Legal Culture,\" Cdeveland Stcatc Lau Review, VoL 38, No. 4 (1990), \"American {Sprins 1991X pp. 5S537. and understood in rather broad terms. Such perspectives suggest that legal culture, in contrast to the routine adoption and amendment of laws by legislative and judicial institutions, refers to a diffuse matrix of beliefs and attitudes which constitute the underpinning of law-related behaviour in a society. For example, Lawrence Friedman -- whose definition will be adopted in this study -- views the term legal cultureu in reference to \"the network of values and attitudes relating to law, which determines why and where pople turn to law or government or turn away? According to Friedman, in order to understand the basic nature of a legal culture it is important to ask the following major What are the attitudes of different populations toward law and the legal system: Who goes to court and wby? Who occupies legal roles-lawyers, judges, policemen - and what do the role - players do? What is the conversion proass of the legal system; that is, how are demands handed, by whom and haw are decisions made? Which officials have discretion; which do not? What questions are matters of rule, and what questions are matters of discretion? Are various parts of the system bureaucratic or flexible? What are the effects of the outputs on the population and hcrw can we measure them? What is the soufce of the legitimacy of various parts of the system? Who is suppad to make law, who is supposed to carry it out? Is there much corruption and maladministration and why?\"' Although Friedman's view of \"legal culture\" suggests a quite complex and fluid mmxpt, it also defines the legal culture in terms of more persistent features. Thus, for illstance, even in demoaatic states where tbe dace action of the legal process provides a Lively spectadc of dmnghg actors and issues, the legal culture's basic perspectives - ' F- Zegal Culture and Social Development,\" p. 34. Lawreace M. Friedman. Tad hake (New York: Russell Sage Foundation, I%#), p. 4a regarding the proper role and ambit of the law are generally quite penistent and deeply rooted. John iMerrymaa has aLro emphasized the imponanee of ihe historical underpinning of legal systems and has described legal culture as: .,.a set of deeply root& historically conditioned attitudes abut the nature of law, about the role of law in society and the polity, about the proper organization and operation of a legal *tern and about the way law is or should be made. applied, mdia perfected and taught? In contrast to Friedman and Menyman, other authors have utilized the concept of legal culture in a narrower sense. For example, in his classic analysis of the Canadian judicial system, Peter Russell equates the legal culture\" with the \"legal tradition\" as used in distinctions among the uaricous families of law. It is Russell's thesis that the exercise of per by the judiciary is shyxd and influenced in any given society by three \"environmentaln factors (1) the level of social and economic development; (2) the prevailing ideology or politid philosophy; and; (3) the Mciety's legal culture? For Russell legal culture in this sense refers to the civil law, in the case of the French legal tradition, ' oh Henry Merryman. 7k Civil LLnv Tmdirion (Stanford, Calif.: Standford University press, 1%9), p- 2. or the common Jaw, in relation to the English legal tradition.1\u0081 Another approach to the analysis of \"legal culture\" is offered by scholars who employ the closely-related concept of \"political culture.\" Studies of political culture -- usually unbentd as attitudes and beliefs about the political system and how it works - focus on tk psychological orientation of individuals and groups with respect to the political system. Research focusing on political culture has identified several different aspects of attitudes towards the political system and its institutions that define the situations in which political mion takes place. These dimensions have been categorized into cognitive, affective, and evaluative or normative dirnen~ions.'~ Studies of attitudes and beliefs concerning the political system, consider political culture to be the link between what happens in the mind of individuals, and bow political institutions bction. From this perspective, studies of Russell actually that the Cauadian legal system is not bifurcated along Frenctr/Eaglish lines, hut that the country's legal traditions are predominately based on the t@ traditions estabiisbed by the \"common b,\" (i-e, the qstem of law indigenous to Great Britain, and through colorhtion, spread through what are today the commonwealth ~*es.) For a Ctiscusion of Quebec's legal culture as the concept is used by Russell see also Job EC, Bricrley, \"We Renewal of Quebec's Distinct Legal Culture: The New Civil Cock of QueW Uhived@ of Torovrto Lon. Id, VoL 42, No. 4 (Fall 1992), pp. 484-503. \" For picmering works in the area of political cultures see, for example, Samuel H. Beet and Adam B. Ulam (eds) Potterm of G0Vemmen.c 17te Mu@ Political (New York: Random House, 1979, pp, 258E; Ckhm ad PM lkwbpmarp ((Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1965). political culture attempt to bridge the gap between the study of the individual in various socio-political contexts and the operation of the political system as a whole.I2 For the student of political culture, legal culture is one component of overall attitudes toward political and governmental institutions. Thus, the attitudes, beliefs, and emotions of the \"operators\" (the \"internal\" legal culture) as well as of the \"users\" (the \"external\" legal culture) of the legal system determine the way in which the legal system actually hnctions. For example, according to Henry Ehrmann's groundbreaking study of cornpararive legal culture, tbe support or disaffection for specific legal institutions will always be linked to traditions and to the culture in which the legal system is embedded. From this perspective, both the political and legal cultures may be viewed as subsystems of their cultural environment. In turn, both of these subsystems contain different cultural subdivisions. Thus, just as in some oountries the army or the militants of a radical party live in a political subculture of their own, in another setting the judicial or another legal subsystem, e.g, the legal profession, might live apart and occasionally clash with values prevalent in the society.\" * An example of tbe political culture debate is found in Stephen Chilton, \"Defining Political Culture,\" Ihe Wm PM @umerl)), Vol. 41, No. 3 (September 1988), pp. 419-4455- For an interesting analysis of political culture and judicial behaviour see Glendon Schubert, mmattional study (1985). The fact that legal cultures are composed of different subsystems or \"subdivisions\" is also an important consideration in most theoretical discussions. As mentioned above, a Iegal culture is not made up of uniform attitudes and beliefs, but rather is composed of different subsystems or subdivisions within the broader legal culture framework. In his comparative analysis of legal culture, Ehrmann defines and explains the \"internal\" legal eulture as the \"legal elite,\" that is, the judges, lawyers, policemen, etc. who have an integral role in the operation of the legal system. Friedman discusses the internal legal culture in a similar fashion, suggesting that the internal legal culture is the domain of the \"legal specialistsn in the legal system, In Friedman's view, although every society has a legal culture, only societies with legal specialists will have an internal legal culture. The internal legal culture can be further broken down into different subsubcategories or groupings. For example, within the internal legal culture, one finds legal specialists or a legal elite composed of defense lawyers, prosecutors, judges, and law enforcement officers, etc. Each of these different groups will have a quite different *mindset\" or perception about the legal system, depending on which segment of the legal system that they operate withia A law enforoement officer attempting t~ fdf3 his quota of drkring offemx, for example, will have a different view of the law and citizens' rights than, for example, a defense lawyer who defends clients charged with traffic offenses. The judge wha adjudicates such cases will have yet a different perspective about the law. Despite their differences, however, these different elite subgroups also have something in common that differentiates them from the external legal culture, that is, a perception of the law that is based on some type of legal training and law-related job experience. The \"external\" legal culture, on the other hand, is composed of individuals who have relatively little or no expertise in the iaw. In Ehrmann's analysis, for example, the external legal culture is created by those individuals who use or who are affected by the law (including victims), but who usuaUy do not play an assertive role in the operation of the legal system. Friedman has pointed out, that unlike the attitudes and beliefs of the legal elite, the external legai culture does not tend to be \"deep, or rational, or systematic, or internally consistent,\" nor does it need to be. Thus, he suggests, the external legal culture is composed of \"popular ideas\" about the law that are held by the \"popular masses of people.\" According to Friedman, whether members of the general population think about these ideas a great deal or only a little, indeed whether they think about them at all, such mass ideas form the \"raw material of the popular culture and thus of both the political and legal culture.\"14 Like the internal legal culture, the external legal culture is also composed of different subgroups. Viewed in this manner, it would be misleading to think of the external legal culture as a monolithic phenomenon. As Friedman puts it: \"There is no such thing as the public; to understand legal culture, one must carefully define a relevant public; for various issues, this will be a different group of people.\"\" \" Friedman, Td Justice, p. 10s. * Fri'edman. Ugal Culture and Social Development,\" p. 40. Friedman has also su~gested in this vein that \"legal culture is not \"public opinim\" in the crude sense of a public opinion pow While the inter and external legal cultures can be thought of as two quite distinct sociai forces, there is inevitably a connection between the two, which is essential if the legal vtem is to function properly. Thus, the internal legal culture often mirrors the external culture, and part of the general community usually shares those attitudes that shape the substantive law and legal institutions. 3. Cu)turr. lUnbrir~.~iousaes~, and Cham Friedman, Ehrmann, aad other scholars have suggested that monitoring and evaluating changes within the legal system is to examine trends and developments within the legal culture. In this respect, the legal system can be thougnt of as dynamic process, characterized and regulated by cycles of demmd and response, According to Friedman, the legal process is set in motion when demands are made on it. These demands originate as general feelings within the extend legal culture about a certain area of the law or legal system. In order for these public emotions and opinions to have an impact on the legal system, they must be converted from opinions and feelings into demands, attitudes, and behaviours that can be processed to fit the requirements of the internal legal culture. Without this transfomtion, the external legal culture will not be adequately processed by the internal legal culture and incorporated into the legal system. As Friedman points out: \"Ma1 pressure' in the aif is not in and of itself a demand on the legal system, except to the extent that such pressire is communicated to legal actors within the legal system, i..e., lawyers, judges, legislators.16 When Friedman talks about \"social pressure in the air\" he is actually referring to changes in the very definition of legal\" in people's miclk for example, changes in the level and shape of public expectations, ideas about what is possible. what is naturai and what is feasible through the law.17 The general feelings reflected in a legal culture regarding fundamental issues of libeny and freedom, or \"rights,\" have also ken generally described as the level of *rights consciousness\" in a society. Put another way, rights cansclousness refers to public attitudes, beliefs, expectations, ttc. about justice and compensation. ixgal scholars have suggested that dealing as it does with intangible concepts, such as Friedman's nsochI pressure in the air.\" rights consciousners \"lacks a cenain clarity of foc'u~~'~ therefore \"difficult to define and operationalize--I' 7&e root of this difficulty can be traced to the complex nature of *rightsw as a concept. Ronald Dworlrin, in his classic treatise, Thking Righrs suggests that the idea of *rightsn has many different senses, and indeed \"has; different force in different contexts,'\" Dworkin describes atizen consciousness '' Of anme* as FJmmnn points OU& in artah situations a legal elite or another power group might introduce: ehgagFs in the law rhat of right,.bas this consequence.

For example, we are describing an aspect of a society% legal character when we say that the society is \"lQ$ous\" or *deferential to authority,\" lmplicit in this description is a comparison with ather; countries and other times, General15 this comparison relates to some sort of modal legal character, or at the uery least, to art increase in the numbers of those who do or do nar poses some specific traif such as a consciousness about rights. In the United States, for immxe, there is an assumption that tights consciousness has grown and become swnger aver time. Tbc 1-1 of rights c;onsciousness in Canadian society, on the other han&, has uaditionally been described as being significantly lower than that exhibited by C\"atlada\"\"sightnaJrs to the south. Such comrentional wisdom has been expressed by one ptllptmlar chronicler of the Canadian national and legal character who has suggested that: IlrC- as everyone ouw'de of a Canadian hockey rink knows, are a quiet, polite peopk. genetially ddy. fomer reticrnt and ahways As Y& This earcp as it Ppplia to tbe Canadian legal character is dixwcd more hrlhpbCbapter2 Friedman suggests that when there is a fundamentai change in the modal character of a society, it often signals the emergence of a new trait in the legal cdture. Take, for example, the case of a legal culture that has traditionally not thought a great deal about rights, or made many rights claims on its government. If a large number of people typically begin to have greater expectations about their rights, and are willing to take concrete steps ta see that such expectations are realized, the overall thinking about mandatory claims and the way the leg1 .system should process such claims may be transformed. According to Friedman, when feelings and expectations about rights multiply within the legal culture, they tend to encourage demands on the law and legal institutions. These demands are in turn processed by the lawmakers and legal institutions. If these components of the legal system respond positively to the demands made by the legal culture, the legal system will spiral in the direction of more rights, which in turn creates greater expectations and a fresh round of demands by the legal culture, and so on. The end result, according to Friedman, may be a radically aitered legal culture. In the following chapter, trends in the legal character and rights mnsciousness of the Canadian legal culture will be examined in light of recent Canadian constitutional dewfopments, and particularly in view of the 1982 entrenchment of the Canadian Charter of Risjirs and Fretdorm. Before embarking on this analysis, however, it is useful to examine some addidonal conceptual areas necessary to any systematic evaluation of a changing legal culture. IV. LEGAL CULTURE AND SOCIAL CHANGE: ADDITIONAL CONCEPTUAL CONSIDERATIONS Research studies focusing on the concepts of legal culture and rights consciousness invariably point out that these phenomena do not lend themselves to easy measurement or evaluation. Indeed, Lawrence Friedman has lamented that there is a marked absence of any systematic literature concerning legal culture. In 1969, Friedman, who pioneered much of the legal culture scholarship suggested: \"What is most notably missing, even for the Western countries, is information on what we have called the legal c~lture.\"~ Over 15 years later, Friedman once again pointed out that: \"Legal culture is not well explored as an object of research, but there does seem to be a growing interest in the subjectnx Those studies that have attempted to mezsure and evaluate changes in a legal culture have suggested that the first hurdle which must be overcome is to identify the indicators or evidence of a legal culture that can be isolated for study over time. In this regard, Friedman bas pointed out that in the absence of any tangible evidence of changes within a legal culture, evidence can be drawn from court opinions. While Friedman and others concede that judicial decisions - which are based on arguments made by lawyers, and interpreted by judges (i.e., agents of the internal legal culture) -- are hardly a random sample of attitudes - they can offer significant insights into the thinking of the broader (i.e., external) legal culture. Thus, because the internal legal culture is in many ways a mirror of the external 25 Friedman, \"Legal Culture and Sacial Development,\" p. 40. ' Friedman, Td Jlraice, p. 32. 18 culture, at least part of the general community often shares those attitudes that shape case Jaw. As such, court decisions -- in the absence of other indicators -- provide the best available evidence of trends and developments within the legal culture. \"Law, being a practical thing,\" the great American jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes, once stated, \"must found itself on actual force^.\"^ This suggestion implies that legal development is inseparable from changes in the underlying societal institutions, as well as from the changing feelings and demands of the community. In a similar vein, a European scholar, Eugen Ehrlich, who was a pathbreaker in the field of comparative legal sociology, summarked his work by explaining that: \"the center of gravity of legal development lies not in legislation, nor in juristic science!, nor in judicial decision, but in society itseitnB \"Society itself\" has indeed been the key and the catalyst to changes in legal systems. Fundamental changes in a !egal culture, for example, have generally accompanied the \"great revolutions\" of Western history. Such societal upheavals are relatively rare, however, and even these landmark events (e.& the American Revolution of 1776, the French Revolution of 1789, the British Revolution of 1640, the Russian Revolution of 1917, etc.) have esscntiaUy transformed a country's legal tradition while still remaining within it. Harold Berman, in his important study, Law mtd Revdurion, has described this trend in historical To speak of a \"tradition\" of law in tbe West is to call attention to two major historical fact.: first, that from the late eleventh and twelfth centuries on, except in \" 7&e C~amnan Lmt (Cambridge, Mas.: Harvard University Press, EWich, Fiadmmd .Princi* of the Smidqp Mdt (Cambridge, Ahss: Hamud University Press, 1912,1936), p. xv. certain periods of revolutionary change. legal institutions in the West developed ~ontinuously over generations and centuries, with each generation consciously building on the work of previous generations; artd second, that this conscious process of continuous development is (or once was) conceived as a process not merely of change but of organic gro~th.~ As a rule the legal culture, as part of the legal tradition, is shaped gradually over an extended period of time, is explicitly and implicitly transmitted by various processes of socialization, and is highly resistant to the transitory events and commonpiace dynamics of a society. Thus, attempting to replace fundamental aspects of historically conditioned legal systems may invite the possibility of one of two situations, either: (1) uprooting fundamental legal traditions, at considerable cost and disruption, or; (2) facing the risk that the new laws and legal institutions would be ineffective.\" Indeed, according to &man: \"even the great national revolutions of the pas t... eventually made peace with the legal traditions that they or some of their leaders set out to destroy.\"\" Given the historical continuity and persistence of legal traditions and legal culture, it is interesting to examine when and why legal changes do occur, and the signrficmce of such changes. According to Friedman, studying legal culture may help determine the conditions under which legal change occurs - either spontaneous change, or imjmed change - and, in the case of imposed change, the conditions which make such changes either succeed of fail. in Friedman's view, legal change a Harold I. Berman, Lnw ad Revoiktik The Tmnswn of the Westem Legal T* (Cambridge, Miss.: 1983), p. 5. Friedma. has suggest4 thot rnmlutionary legal r -age judiciary; an aEtivist legal profdon; a gerrmne social movement, wb values are shed by the judiciary. Totcrlhdce, pp. 31-32 and changes in social attitudes and beliefs are inextricably connected. Thus, he explains: *I@ institutions are responsive to social change; moreover, they have a definite role, rather poorly understood, as instruments that set off, monitor, or otherwise regulate the fact or pace of social change.\"= Although it is difficult to measure the relationship between law and SOCI*~~ change, it is inevitable that changes in a legal system reflect shifts in social attitildes and values, which in turn may have a significant influence on societal development. Thw, as one study of legal culture and sacial change has put it: \"in times of red and perceived emergencies, of major technological breakthroughs, of social catastrophes and widespread indignation, law will make the jump that enables it to confirm or even accelerate social change.\" Another way of viewing the relqtionship between legal and social change is to examine how the legal culture, i-e., the network of societal attitudes and value; about the law, influence legal behaviour in terms of the nature and quantity of demands the legal culture places upon the legal system, and how it processes such demands. Depending on the research issue at hand legal culture can be xmeptualized as: a) an independent variable influencing the administration of justice and the iegal dimensions of different subsystems (e.g., including the education system); b) a dependent variable affected by different irrititutions and actors (e.g, the judiciary, lawmakers, interest groups, etc.) or; c) an intervening variable conditioning the legal interface between the citizen and the state. According to Friedman \"pure legal behaviour obviously depends on feelings and FrjedmM \"Legal Cube and Sofial Development,' p. Lcgd Culncrec, p. 4. 21 attitudes; these are also important in determining whether subjects of the law will form groups, exert pressure on the law for change, act as enemy deviants and the like.\" Thus, Friedrnan suggests that legal changes are likely to occur when sociai force, i-e., power, influence, presses upon the legal system and evokes legal acts, when leg& culture converts interests into demands or permit. conversion. As such, Friedrnan contends that the legal culture component of a legal system is the immediate source of any legal change, no matter what the original source may have been. Hence, the dynamics of the legal culture must always be taken into account in studying legal and social change. V. ANALYZING LEGAL CULTURE Tbe Merits and Demerits of 1. lm~act Analvsis As discussed earlier, one way of understanding the nature and dynamics of legal culture is to analyze judicial decisions. More specifically, an evaluation of changes in a legal culture can be canied out by studying the \"impact\" of constitutional adjudication on popular thinking about law, and in particular, on thinking about rights. \"Impact analysis,\" the study of how lawsw affect -a1 attitudes and behaviour, znampts to evaluate under what conditions people utilize, react, or ignore particular legal rules During the 19705 and 198(k scholars attempted to employ impact analysis to assist ibe term \"law\" is used broadly to include constitutions, legislation, judieial decisions, and judicial-like decisions (e-g, arbitration aad tribunal decisions). in determining the ultimate consequences of laws.u Most of such impact literature tended to be rather exploratory in nature, and a satisfactory conceptual framework did not emerge from that body of research. Indeed, a 1973 review of some of the early impact studies still held true in many respects in the early 1990s: None of these studies tests a theory of policy impact (or even a partial one), or elaborates a conceptual framework to guide their own or other research. Nor do any of the studies rely on even modestly rigorous analysis of their data. Still, in this newly tilled soil, I will argue that these studies taken cumulatively lay the foundation for a theory of impact? What factors enable particular laws, legal instruments, or legal acts to either modify or change social values and attitude@ This is the central question arising from the impact analysis literature.' Using a commonsense definition of \"impact,\" laws and legal acts can * For pioneering impact analysis studies with reference to American experience see, for example, Kenneth Dolbeare, \"The Supreme Court and the States: From Abstract Doctrine to Local Behavioral Conformity,\" in Theodore L Becker (ed), 13ce Impad of Supreme Cowt Decisions (New York: Oxford University Press, 1%9), pp. 206213; Joel B. Grossman and May H. Grossman (eds.), Law mrd Chge in Modenz America (California: R.

Legal acts may, of course, take may forms. For example, any decision by a legal z~~thority, such as a court or legislature, may constitute a legal act. Much of the thinking abwt impact analysis had it origins in studies focusing on education law decisi011~. For early examples of such studies see Frank Way, \"Survey Eksearch on Judicial Decisions: The Prayer and M. Patric, 'The I. of a Court be said to have an \"impact\" on society when they are causally related to somebody's conduct. Following Lawrence Friedman once again, the term \"impact\" as used in this study means \"behaviour causally linked to a rule or command.\"\" Attempting to measure or evaluate \"impact\" is a difficult and ambitious ~ndertaking.~ First, as Friedman points out, there is the question of cause and effect. For example, how is it possible to prove that a legal act actually affects a particular form of behaviour? Is it possible to disentangle legal causation from other causal agents? Friedman has suggested that there are two important elements that can be isolated in order to help measure the impact of a particular legal act: 1) the law in question must call for behaviour which is easily seen or observed and; 2) it must be possible to separate this behaviour from behaviour that would have occurred in the absence of such a law. For example, Friedman argues that if the speed limit is lowered, it must be possible to evaluate not only how many people obey the reduced speed limit, but also how many people have changed their behaviour as a result of the new law. This kind of evaluation would require \"before and after da-\" or some kind of measurable substitute, Decision: Aftermath of the McCo11um Case,\" Jod of Public Law, Vol. 6 (Fall 1%5), pp. 455-463; Frank So- \"Zorach v.

One method that analysts have employed to study legal culture, focuses on how court-made decisions impact on legal change and sucial behaviour. Impact analysis focusing on judicial decisions, thus concentrates on the \"substantive\" element of the legal system, and in particular on the output of the courts as reflected in their judicial adjudication (aspects of the internal legal culture) as a vehicle for amdying the more brd-based attitudes and beliefs of the general (i.e, external) legal culture. In methodologicaJ terms, judicial decisions or \"case law\" provide a voluminous and quite accessible data base for studying changes in the legal cultwe. Evaluating the impact of judicial decisions on social change, however, proves to be a rather more complex task. In this regard, one scholar has pointed out that the method of ascertaining the causal connection between judicial decisions and social chauge \"by Science Pmpective, p. 54. \" For example, in a 1985 Canadian study on public opinion and the law, the editors point wt: Ihe intriguing question of whether and how the legal system contributes to the f-tion of pblic attinades about other mates - moral issues, business ethics, family relathships, or the way bascball and hockey should be played - does not appear to have yet rcctivad &gWam scho~ aft en ti or^\" Dale G1bn d Janet K. Baldwin (eds.), Law in a Gynkai Jbcid),: Ophitm d ared LAW Lmu in 1980's (w Legal PLIMlcations, Western Division, 1985). means a self-evident pr~position.'~' Moreover, the Canadian legal scholar, Alan C. Hutchinson has suggested that: \"the task of measuring the effect of judicial decisions on social behaviour is positively Herculean. Not only is there no convenient judicial Richter Scale available, but there is no reliable seismographic equipment to identify and isolate the impact of adj~dication.~ Despite such methodological problems, Hutchinson and others still believe it is possible to make some general observations about the impact, or causal relationship between judicial adjudication and social change. As Krislov put it: ... the critical problem is to show that a change in a substantive law or a judicial decision in favour of a particular litigant and a subsequent change in social behaviour or arrangements \"is not coincidental, but consequentially related.& Arthur S. Miller, in his classic study of impact analysis and decision-making by the U.S. Supreme Court, suggests that analysis of judicial adjudication allows for the most comprehensive and systematic evaluation of the direction of social behaviour and change in the legal culture. According to Miller, for example, impact analysis \"looks to the consequences of judicial decisions and evaluates them in accordance with the extent to which they further the attainment of social goals.\" In an argument similar to Friedman's, Miller suggests that Supreme Court decisions are not simply based on the interpretation and application of legal principles and doctrines, but rather are predicated on the justices' perception of haw their judgments will impact on both individual litigants and society as a xi Miller, \"On the Need for 'Impact Analysis' of the Supreme Court Decisions,\" p. 15. Hutchimon, \"Charter Litigation and Social (New York: Free Press, 1%8), pc 116. whole. Thus, Miller characterizes the judiciary as forward-looking and \"result-oriented\" as much as it is *concept-oriented*: Choices are made by Justices from among conflicting principles (or inconsistent interests) not because of compelling law, but because of an evaluation of what the impact of a given decision is thought to be.' A number of competing views have been advanced with respect to the question of whether or not judicial decisions influence social change. One school of thought, for example, suggests that judicial decisions have little impact on societal behaviour and by inference, the legal culture. In this view, laws and legal acts are seen as only being able to \"codify\" existing customs, values, attitudes, etc., but incapable of shaping people's mores and values. According to this perspective, laws can only gradually emerge into a formal or dified state afler they have become pan of routine social behaviour. As such, legal rules arc considered to have an essentiaiiy \"passive\" or \"non-instnunentala function. For example, in his 1%5 study, William M. Evans explained that the view of law as a \"passhe* social force is rooted in the 19th century philosophies of \"social daminism\" and hi~ton'd jurispmdem. The: Americarl sociologist, W.G. century piooeen of tbis appr~\" It w~ Sumner's thesis that law is a passive rather than Miller. \"@I the Need for *- -is' of the Supreme Coun Deeiriorn,' p. 9. an active social force, which gradually emerges into a formal or edified state (i.e., judicial decisions, legislation) only after it has taken root in the behaviour of the members of society- According to Surnncr, whenever an effort is made to change or enact a law in contradiction to existing mores, vdues, or \"folkways\"' of a society* conflicts arise which result in the evenrud undoing of the law, Since Surnner claims that there is a *strain toward a consistency of the mores;\" he concludes, in his classic treatise, that nstateways canmt change folkw ays.ja A more recent Canadian vm-ant of this view is admmed by Alan Hutchinson. Hutchinson's work, which focuses on the impact of judicial adjudication an societal change, has suggested that while adjudication clearly is a significant feature of modern life, judicial decisions do not function as independent instruments of m5d change. Asserting that constitutional adjudication \"is not important because it can cawc anything to happen.\" Hutchiman suggests that mchl change does not necessarily flow from judicial decisions, i.e,, that mnstitutional adjudication does nat have an instrumental impact. instead, he argues that it is p<l6sible far a judicial decision to be undermined by unsupponive and \"unsympathetic sacial forceqC while other decisions may be enhd by a supportive public vicWvicw4P According to Hut- ofwn only an interlude or phast in a larger social smug& ad that the end of the litig~h marks the beginning of the next stage in a continuing sod\"al pruus.\" Hutchinwn take kwc with rhc instmmentakt view of law, i.e., that law is nat merely a reflection of enisu\"ng customs, rnsrals, or codes, but is also a potentially \"indepcn&nrw or \"active'\" social farce which can directly influewe behaviour and beliefs, According ta Wutchinxm, for more bwycrs make the most tucfiaw claims for the efficacy and influence of comtilulional litigation ad CWN~' Armher school of thought has awed quite a different penpective concerning this subject, namely, that fe@ wles and 1egCaf &&ions do have the pottntid to as a significant -aJ forceY This \"&t4 or *instrumental\" view of the law posits that the hpaa of legal rub and decisions may aaually media( or change the khaviwr and values glEuing in a panictalar SIOCitty.

In Evans' view, if law is to have an instrumental impact on social attitudes and behaviour, it must entail two interrelated processes: the institutionalization, and the internalization of patterns of behavior. In this context, institutiombation of a pattern of behavior means the establishment of a norm with provisions for its enforcement, and internalization of a pattern of behavior means the incorporation of the value or values implicit in a law. Law, as has been noted by others, can only affect behavior directly through the prooess of institutionalization; if, however, the institutionalization process is wccesst'ul it may, ia tum, hatate the internalization of attitudes or beliefs.* a William M.

FROM THEORY TO CONTEXT: LEGAL CULTURE IN CANADA Canadian society in recent decades, and indeed throughout the history of Confederation, offers an excellent laboratory to utilize and analyze the rich fabric of themes and issues raised in the sheoretical-conceptual literature relating to legal culture. For example, has the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms led to an institutionalization and internationalization of a pattern of behaviour, attitudes and beliefs about mandatory citizen rights? If so, have these processes caused an alteration in the legal culture with respect ta traditional views about rights? Put another way, is the Chmter having a notable and instrumental impact on the Canadian legal culture? In turn, to what extent has the legal culture affected the reception of the new constitutional framework? In the following background chapter, the possibilities of a transformation in the Canadian legal culture will be discussed in light of the \"legal revolution\" accompanying the 1982 repatriation of the Canadian constitution, and the entrenchment of a Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

CANADA'S \"LEGAL CHARACTER\": AN HISTORICAL OVERVIEW Developments in the Canadian legal system during the 1980s and early 1990s provide an excellent setting in which to study the complex and subtle transformation of a legal culture- In 1982, following decades of discussion on the subject, Canadian politicians forged a new constitutional fiameworlc, including a novel Chmter of Rightc and Freedom.\" The adoption of entrenched constitutional rights was both heralded and decried by its architects for its potential impact on the way Canadians would endeavour to advancs and protect their basic civil liberties.' By 1994, although the Canadian Cher of Right and Freedoms had ' Comments made in his address to the Canadian Bar Association, Globe and Mail, February 5, 1985, p. 1. Part I, Conslitrcrion Ad 1982, Schedule B, Cmrctda Ad 1982, c. 11, (U.K). Hereafter the Charter or the constitution. For example, according to Michael Kirby, one of Prime Minister Trudeau's key constitutional advisors, \"to have achieved the Charter of R@zts... was an enormous achievement.\" Oa tbe other hand, Manitoba Premier Sterling Lyon, who \u0081'inally signed on to the Charter on behalf of Manitoba has remarked: \"We didn't need a charter in our system. and we've seen the disastrous effects of the courts becoming final arbiters of social, d to some extent even economic, and certainly political matters in the United States, and only been in effect for twelve years, and only eight years with respect to its imponant equality provisions, it had - not surprisingly to most participants in the constitutional debates of the late 1970s and early 1980s -- generated profound changes in the Canadian legal system and legal behaviour. While the Canadian constitutional developments of the 1980s did not occur as a result of violence and social upheaval which often preceded major legal revolutions elsewhere in the Western world, there were clear signs during the tint decade under the new constitution that the Charter of Rights and Freedoms was having a significant impact on Canada's legal development. \"The impact [of the Ciuuter] has come faster than I expected,\" said one member of the Supreme Court of Canada in 1987. \"In hindsight I must have been insane not to expect it .... I call it an implosion. Suddenly anything can come to youad Indeed, as many detractors of the constitution had predicted, there were indications that, by the late 1980s and early 1990s, Canadians had become more \"rights consc~ous,\" and that Canada's legal culture was undergoing a fundamental transformation. Pronouncements of fundamental or radical change in any aspect of Canadian society traditionally invite scepticism among observers in Canada Canadians, according to the comrentionai wisdom, have a non-revolutionary or counter-revolutionary history and I didn't think. nor did too many others, that we needed to import that kind of trouble into our system ...I tend to view the ChcPler as being something tbat was mischievous and continues to be mischievous, and will cause us a lot of unneeded trouble ... there's an awful lot of hail stones and stormy and rocky weather in it.\" Itenard J. Cohen and Paul V. Wanwick, et aL, The Vi mad the Gmne.- Making the Cmradimt Go netitution (Calgary: Detselig Press, 1987), pp. 9, 18, 93. Premier Lyon was subsequently appointed to the ~CourtofAppeal, \"national character.\" Lacking the traumatic experience of a violent political revolution or a civil war, and cherishing their British legacy of conservative change and traditional values, English-speaking Canadians in particular are often characterized as individually and co1lectively cautious, adverse to risk-taking, and hardly able to tolerate much more than a \"quiet revolutionn by the culturally less conformist francophonic population in the province of Quebec. In similar fashion, studies of Canadian political culture emphasize the deferential attitudes of tbe munay's citizens toward established authority, and also their restrained tones of political expression. Such deference and moderation are particularly apparent when contrasts are made with the more iconoclastic habits and flamboyant style of political activity in the United states.' Conventional generalizations about Canada's legal culture correspond closely to those about the country's national character and political culture- Thus, Canadians are seen as less litigious, less \"rights conxiow\" and generally more respectful toward laws and legal authorities than citizens in likral democracies with a revo1uu'onar)r tradition Weed, one historian concluded in the early 1960s that Canada's \"final gwerning force ... is tradition and conventiona When compared to the United States, for example, Canada's relatively low ratio of police officers and lawyers to tbe general population has allegedly indicated that respect for public authority is grounded in \"informal social controls\" rather than the \"restrictive emphasis of legal saactions.\" Canada's lower crime rates also seem to reinforce the contrast ' See!, for example, Edgar Z Friedenberg, Lkjmme to Awhariry: of Toronto Press, 1%1), p. 86. with the American propensity to utilize extra-legal measures to correct what is perceived to be a wrong? Although the image of Canadians as being law-abiding and trustful toward legal and political authorities has seemed generally credible when making cross-border comparisons, observers have also drawn some attention to a striking erosion of respect for legal authority and the legal system in Canada during the second half of 'the twentieth century. Thus, one view maintains that by the 1980s Canada had become more of a \"cynical society\" than a deferential one with regard to legal matters. For example, a survey conducted in the 1980s concerning popular attitudes toward the Canadian legal system revealed that although most respondents supported the legal system, 82.7% also indicated that they respected the law less in 1980 than five years earlier. Sightly more than half of the people surveyed felt that most people were law-abidiW8 Such findings supported the views of a leading Canadian jurist that respect for the law had deteriorated among Canadians: As social conflicts grow more and more virulent, and as workers, both intellectual and manual, forge a unity and discover a new solidarity, three parallel phenomena manifest themselves in contemporary [Canadian] society, and particularly in Quebec: the rejection of authority, whether religious, political or judicial; the gradual emergence of a general amorality; and finally, the politickation of the masses? Soe Roben Moore, \"Refleaions of Caaadiaas on the Law and the Legal System: Legal Researcb Institute Survey of Respondents in Montreal, Toronto and Winnipeg,\" in Dale Gthm and Janet K. Baldwin (&), Law in a cynical Sclciety? Opinion arad the Law in the 19&0\"s (Cdpy CarsweU Publications, Division, 1985), pp. 41-87. Moore, \"Refledom of Canadiam on the Law and iht: Legal System,\" pp. 72-73. To what extent deference was actually supplanted by cynicism in the Canadian \"legal character\" is rather unclear, however, from the analyses suggesting such a trend. It is also important to note that the two mindsets, i-e., deference and cynicism, are by no means mutually exclusive. Rather more certain to observers in Canada at the outset of the 1980s, was that the formal legal rules had changed significantly, and also that many groups and social conflicts had indeed become more politicized.\" Thus, one of the major questions following the 1982 entrenchment of the Canadian constitution was whether the Charter of Rig&s and Freedoms would reinforce or alter the country's recent legal trends and fundamental legal traditions. Before endeavouring to shed some light on those important questions it is useful to place Canadian constitutional developments during the 1980s and 1990s into a more comprehensive historical and legal context. An historical survey of constitutional arrangements and attitudes, and also Canadian thinking about \"rights,\" are especially pertinent for any discussion of Canada's evolving legal character. The nex3 section of the chapter will examine the historical roles of Canada's legislatures and courts in protecting and advancing Canadian civil rights. The survey will begin at confederation and cover tbe period up to tbe constitutional debates of the late 1970s and early 1980s. \" See. for example, FL Morton, The Poi3ical Impaa of the hehurter of Rights, Ocxashntal Paper Series, University of Calgary, October 1986. n. PARLIAMENTARY SC~PREMACY: THE POLITICALLEGAL TREATMENT OF CANADIAN CML RIGHTS The role of the Canadian judiciary from Canada's confederation in 1867 until the patriation of the Canadian constitution from the United Kingdom in 1982, was defined and characterized by the British doctrine of \"parliamentary s~prernacy.\"'~ First articulated during the 19th century by the British constitutional scholar, kV. Dicey in his classic treatise, Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Co n.s&&n, parliamentary supremacy was based on two principles: (1) parliament has the constitutional right to make or unmake any law whatever; and (2) no person or body may constitutionally ovemde or set aside the legislation of parliament.= These constitutional principles were adopted by the Canadian founding fathers, in a form modified to fit Canada's federal political system\" Thus, the l1 Prior to the entrenchment of the ChMer in 1982, the Canadian legal system was almost entirely based on and influenced by the British common law. Indeed, prior to 1949 the highest court designated to hear Canadian civil and criminal appeals was the British Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (House of Lords). Appeals to the House of Lords were abolished in 1949, and the Supreme Court of Canada was made the court of last resort, * 10th ed. by E.C.S. Wade (London: Macmillan Papermac, 1965). p. 39. - * Canada's federal system of government divided power between two levels of government. This model departed from the British unitary form of government where power was concentrated m one central gsvemment. Some constitutional scholars have argued that the federal sharing of powers is incompatible with the notion of parliamentary supremacy, The nature of \"Canadian\" parliamentary supremacy as distinct from the traditional British model has been the subject of a voluminous literature.

Manfra JW Power and the Chartec Gmah and the Paradox Canadian federal parliament and each of the ten provincial legislatures were constitutionally empowered with the exclusive right to make laws within the scope of their respective \"exhaustive\" powers enumerated in Sections 91 and 92 of the British North America Act (the BNA ~ct).\" As in the British tradition, the role of the Canadian judiciary was constitutionally subordinate to that of the legislative branch Thus, while the courts were empowered to exercise judicial review of constitutional questions, their jurisdiction was limited to resolving conflicts between the federal government and the provinces concerning the exercise of legislative power under Section 91 and 92 of the BNA Act, ad did not extend to decisions concerning the substantive merits of such legislation. 1. r to Wdd War 18 The principle of parliamentary supremacy as a major oonstruct in Canadian political development has been central to the evolution of Canadiian civil rights and liirties. For example, until the Chmter was adopted in 1982, no explicit Canadian constitutional protections existed which yaranteed citizen rights and freedoms.* Unlimited by I~OW as the C(h- . - Act 1867, Constitution Act 1982, S$tedule B, Omoda Act 1982, c. 11, (U.K). Secdon 91 sets out thc scope of powers which can be solely exercised by the federal parliamtnt and section 92 sets out the powers which cau be exercised exclusively by the pfovjacial kgidaturcs. Sectioo 93 provids that education is within provincial jurisdiction. * On a fcar umrruPl occniom. however, the amts attempted to \"read BNA Act an *implied 11957) S.C.R. human rights restrictions, both the provinces and the federal government were constitutionally at liberty to enact laws that discriminated against certain sectors of Canadian society, and routinely did enact such legislation (see below). For its pan, the judiciary was constitutionaIly restricted from reviewing legislation on the basis of its substantive correctness. Thus the judiciary routinely acknowledged that \"courts of law have no right whatsoever to inquire whether [legislative] jurisdiction has been exercised wisely or not.\"I6 In any case, during this period of time the central concern of Canadian society, governments, ad the courts was the fiee exercise of commercial enterprise, even if it was at the expense of individual civil rights and freedoms.17 In the absence of civil rights constitutional protections or legislation, the few plaintiffs who did challenge discriminatory behaviour by the government or other citizens were forced to fall back on the common law. Such attempts were largely umuccessful, hawever, with the courts refusing to acknowledge that the common law provided a cause of action or remedy for intentional acts of *~mioatioan18 The general mindset of the legislators and judges, (i.e., the internal legal culture) with 285.

The reaction of Canadian citizens, governments and courts to ethnic minorities in Canada provides a useful vehicle for examining these attitudes.19 For example, the growing Chinese population in British Columbia, and particularly in the City of Vancouver - which coincided with the building of the Canadian Pacific Railway - was met by popular protests and petitions ur@ng the government to limit the immigration of \"aliens.\" In 1887, these \"antian'ental\" protests turned into mob riots, and mass-attended public, meetings were routinely held at the Vancouver City Hail. Newspapers, businessmen, and prominent politicians all warned that the influx of Chinese would force property prices to decline, and an anonymous \"Vigilance Committeen regularly pasted notices which urged Chinese citizens to leave Vancouver: All Chinamen must leave tbe city limits on or before the 16th January instant, and all Chinamen found within the city on or after that date will be fora'biy ejected and their goods and chattels moved to False Creek or such other places as aomrenience may dictate. And we warn the authorities not to interfere with us if they value their lives,aswemeanbusinassandare~etermioedinouraction?0 In a as well as popular sense, Orientat citizens and other ethnic minorities were treatcd as xcood-dass atizem, ix, inferior to tbe two Caoadian charter groups (tbe white \" For an imerestiqg dhcnshn of the treatment of miaioritier h Canada see Thomas R.

For example, when a Canadian citizen challenged British Columbia legislation which prohibited \"Orientals\" from wing in Id government cl~iow, the constitutional question put to the courts was whctbcr tk legislation was a proper exercise of provincial pawtr as it related to \"elections\" under Section 92 of the BNA Act, or whether it was an improper exerck of federaf power relating to *immigration and aliensm under Section 91 of the constitution, fhe case finally made its way to Canada's Sinat appellate court, the Judicid Committee of the Privy Council (the Jm) which ded that rhe legislation purponed to regulate *aliens\" and was therefore ouuidt the scope @h vim) of the provincial Iggislatute. On basir, the provinrrial law was ?stmck down.

Diefenbaker (later Prime Minister Diefenbaker), first suggested in 1945 that a bin of rights would be tbe but metbod to protect and advance civil liberties. After 15 yeam of public comwersy, parIiafnentary debate, and Senate hearings, the Canadian Bill ofIGghrJ28 was passed into law as a federal statute in 1%0. Although the Canadian Bill of Rights was greeted by many Canadians with enthusiasm and anticipation, in retrospect it is viewed as having provided only very limited civil rights protection.29 Several factors contributed to this situation. First, because the Bill of Rights was a federal statute it only applied to federal legislation, and did not extend to cover provincial laws. Second, as the BiU of Righrs was not an endwing constitutional instrument, but only a statute (sometimes refencd to as a quasi-constitutional statute) which could be repealed at any time by the prevailing government of the day, it lacked the moral and political authority necessary to create a different mindset concerning the importance and centrality of rights and freedoms. Third, the BZ of Rights included a provision which allowed the government to exempt certain legislation from its protections. Finally, in view of the above factors, when challenges were launched whicb claimed that federal legislation was discriminatory, the courts were extremely reluctant to exercise the judicial authority required to strike down legislation that conflicted with the Bilf of Ri@z&. The Supreme Court of Canada in particular was not convinced that the Canadian Bill of Rigks had altered the scope of judicial review traditionally exercised by the court under the doctrine of parliamentary supremacy, and with the exception of the 1970 case of R v. D.rybona,jo did not uphold any * For P oompfchemive disausion of the cases decided under the Bill of Righy see TillllOPOfSltY, nhe Cmtodiatr the 37, No. 1 (March 19591 p. ?7-134. claims advanced on the basis of the federal rights legislation.\" As a result of these and other reasons, the 1960 BiU of Rrghts is today regarded as a rather ineffectual experiment, more important for its educative value than for its actual expansion or protection of civil liberties.\" Even before its enactment in 1960, the Bill's fatal flaws were pointed out by some critical and perceptive observers. Among the harshest critics of the anti-discrimination legislation was the preeminent constitutional jurist (and poet), F.R. Scott, who argued: It is only a very partial Bill, applicable only in peacetime, no stronger than the self- restraint of our federal members of Parliament at any given moment, and inapplicable to provincial legislatures. Moreover, it is confined to political and personal freedoms; it makes no attempt to protect other human rights, like the right to nondiscrimination in employment. Cultural and economic rights are also omitted. It is moreover drafted in technical legal jargon. If this is the best we can do, we are admitting that we are not really deeply concerned about civil liberties.\" At the same time the federal government had turned its attention to civil rignts in the post-World War I1 period, the provinces also introduced a number of legislative initiatives designed to protect civil libertiesVM For example, in 1944, the Ontario legislature '' Following Drybacs, the Supreme Coun of Canada retreated into its traditional policy of judicial restraint in decisions such as AG. of Canada v. f,uveII, 11974) S.C.R. 1349, and A.G. of S-C-R. 170. a The Omdian Bill ofR@fs is still in force, although the Chrma bar superseded the proteaions offered in the fadera1 statute. Lihwks in Camah (Toronto: Uniwrsity of Toronto Rq 19591, p. 56. enacted its first anti-discrimination statute, The Racial Discrimination Act, which prohibited the expression of racial or religious discrimination in publications or displays. It was not until 1947, however, that the first wide-ranging provincial human rights legislation was introduced in Canada. Thus, in 1947 the Saskatchewan Bill of Rights was enacted in order to guarantee \u0081'reedom of speech, association, assembly, and religion. The Saskatchewan legislation also prohibited discrimination with respect to accommodation, occupation, and education on the basis of race, creed, religion, colour, or ethnic or national origin. According to the statute, complaints of discrimination were to be adjudicated by the judiciary, and discrimination contrary to the legislation would attract a maximum penalty of $200 or a three-month prison term in default of payment. Despite its good intentions, the quasi-criminal sanctions in the novel Saskatchewan Bill of Rim did not prove to be a very successful means of promoting or protecting civil liberties in the province. Thus, relatively few discrimination claims were brought under the statute, and when claims were initiated, courts were often reluctant to enter convictions. Moreover, in the few cases where convictions were entered, the prescni sanction did not appear to be a deterrent to further discriminatory actions. By the 1950s the majority of Canadian provinces, prompted in large measure by the 1W8 Universal kLndon of Hrunan RiglusU had enacted statutes guaranteeing tmplaynaent accommodation Prohiiited grd of cbmmmm . a. 'on were arpaadad from race, creed, religion, coiour, ethnic or national origin to indude age and gender. Notwithstanding these imptovernems, however, the human rights legislation of this period also proved to be largely ineffectual in eradicating systemic discrimination for many of the same reasons that the 1847 Saskatchewan Bill of Rigkts had not been overwhelmingly successful. Thus, this legislation continued to place the whole emphasis of protecting and promoting civil rights upon the individual who had been discriminated against. The result was that very few complaints were made, and very little enforcement achieved. During the 1960s, the earlier anti-discrimination statutes were consolidated, expanded, and placed in new legislative frameworks designed to overcome many of the problems associated with the rights legislation of the 1940s and 1950s. By the 1970s, all the provinces and territories had enacted comprehensive human rights codes, and had established human rights commissions to administer the new statutes. These anti- discrimination initiatives proved more successful than their predecessors, for a number of reasons including: (1) they covered a broader range of activities (e.g., employment, accommodation, advertising, commercial and residential tenancy); (2) Human Rights Commissions were authorized to receive and investigate complaints, thus removing this burden fiom the individual complainant; (3) the Commissions were empowered to adjudicate complaints, thereby removing the time and cost element involved in ordinary litigation; and (4) most Commissions were also designed to play an educative role in the area of human rights, thus taking a preventive approach to discrimination. Notwithstanding the expanded ambit of Canadian rights in the post World War II period, politicians, the public, and members of the judiciary were still not satisfied that . .. tk measures were adequate. While the postwar provincial and federal anti-dmmmation statutes were an imprwemcnt on the prewar situation, it was widely believed that the legislation still did not address the civil rights of Canadian citizens in a meaningful fashion. A central concern in this regard was that the postwar human rights legislation only applied to individual (as opposed to governmental) acts of discrimination. The limited scope of provincial anti-discrimination iegislation, together with the impotence of the Canadian Bill of Rights to check governmental legislation and actions that infringed citizen rights, fuelled debate in the late 1970s about the need for further and more fundamental civil rights protections. Until civil rights and freedoms were constitutionally entrenched, critics maintained, Canadian rights would not be adequately recognized or protected, nor would Canadians feel the sense of nationhood that characterized countries such as the United States. The next section of this chapter will discuss the constitutional events of the late 1970s and early 1980s, including the debates leading up to the constitutional entrenchment of the Charter of Rights and Fresdoms in 1982. IIL CANADA'S NEW CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK Advocates of a constitutionalEy entrenched charter of rights maintained that the poor track record of Canada's legishtors in the realm of civil rights and liberties suggested that the authority and responsibility for protecting and promoting human rights should be assigned to the murts with ultimate authority residing in the Supreme Court of ~anada? - -- - * See, fa nampl+ early arguments by Pierre Trudeau, \"Constitutional the Fd-- (Toronto: In 1980, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau -- largely motivated by his vision of a bilingual and bicultural Canada and the necessity of protecting minority language education rights -- launched a federal initiative to develop a constitutional amending formula, to repatriate the Canadian constitution from Great Britain, and to adopt a constitutionally entrenched charter of rights and freedoms. These important initiatives, Prime Minister Trudeau maintained, would serve to both protect the fundamental rights of Canadian citizens, and would also enhance national unity? Indeed in 198 1, Prime Minister Trudeau implored the members of the House of Commons to constitutionally entrench a rights charter in the national interest, maintaining: \"Lest the forces of self interest tear us apart, we must now define the common thread that binds us together.\"' Thus, approximately 40 years after the first provincial human rights legislation was enacted, and 20 years after the passage into law of the Diefenbaker Bill of Rights, a lively Canadian debate about civil rights and liberties re-emerged as part of Rime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau's 1981 constitutional \"peoples' package.\" Aher a tumultuous and emotionally charged constitution- making process, the Canadian constitution was pamated in 1982 together with an See, for example, Trudeau's remarks in the Hawe of Conunons Deb-, Md om.\" Although Canadian constitution-makers embarked on the constitutional patriation process with these explicit goals in mind, they exhibited less clarity about how a constitutionally entrenched charter would actually function. For exsmple, like earlier constitutional architects in other environments, the Canadian constitution's modem founding father, Prime Minister Trudeau, was simultaneously driven by two motives: (1) his fundamental constitutional vision for the country, and; (2) the more mundane practical political imperatives necessary to implement that vision. An illustration of this phenomenon can be seen in Trudeau's last address to the House of Commons on March 23, 1981, in which he made reference to his general constitutional vision, but also candidly expressed his uncertainty about what its implementation would entail for the oountry's political future: We are merely setting tbe stage with a contest about the kind of Canada we will have in the future .... Will we be highly centralized? Will we be a loose confederation of shopping centres ... ? Will we be something in between? I don't know.@ It may be that this overriding concern with \"setting the stagew prompted the Charter's political sponsors to maintain the purpose of an entrenched bill of rights was \"to give the courts, in an open and direct manner, the authority they need to protect basic rights and * For an interesting discussion of the constitution-making process see Cohen and Warwick, l%e Vision amd the Gmrre; Robert Sheppard and Michael The National Deal (Tmmto: of R&&s Toronto Press, 1982); Ncw Canadian C- . .

With the exception of the Charter's controversial non obstante or opting out clause -- which was poLitically motivated as a means to ensure a provincial check on the constitution's centralizing (i-e., federal) provisions rather than a legislative brake on the court's authority42 -- the constitutional framers devoted relatively little attention to the role and responsibilitie~ of the courts following the entrenchment of the Charter. Thus, while the framers surely anticipated that their constitution-making work would have far-reaching effects on the Canadian legal system, they did little to spell out explicitly the nature and implications of the legal changes that might ensue. Those debates that did take place concerning the adoption of a written rights document and the role of the judiciary in interpreting tha; document often focused on whether the entrenchment of the Charter would \"Americanize\" the Canadian legal and political system. In this vein, one member of parliament complained, for example: There are some parts of the Charter of RCgitts and Freedom I do not like. I do not like turning my life over to the courts and to interpretation by the courts. That is alien to our form of government and our social consciousness. That is something that is ~merican.~~ 41 Houce of Commons Debates (1981), p. 13428. Section 33, commoaly referred to as the mn obsrMte or override clause, was finally incfuded in the C=hmta as a result of a major federal concession to the provinces. The amtrwersial provision is gemrally understood as a \"subtle way of presenring the present khce among CaDadian political institutions, that is, tbe traditional imbalanoe in favour of the provincial legislames,\" Peter \"Canada's New Charter of Rights,\" Americm Jd of Contpmative Law, VoL 32, No. 2 (Spring 1984), pp. 283-305. While criticism concerning the vision of the constitutional hers may have been warranted in the political atmosphere of the constitutional debates, it is somewhat unfair to have expected them to clearly envision all of the Charter's possible consequences. For example, the constitution-makers took for granted, and had little reason to question, either the future viability of the well-established and widely accepted tradition of parliamentary supremacy, or a continuation of the Canadian Supreme Court's record of judicial self- restraint.44 Given those political and judicial traditions, it is not surprising that the framers rather easily sidestepped suggestions that judicial interpretations of the Charter might eventuate in a fundamental shift of power from the legislative to the judicial braixh of government. Moreover, when the framers did consider the possibility of an enhanced role for the court prior to 1982, that eventuality was largely downplayed or dismissed as exceedingly remote and essentially antithetical to the Canadian legal and political culture, En other words, it might be argued that the framers intended and expected that the Charter wouid protect fundamental rights and freedoms and thus foster national unity, but they did not, and indeed could not, fully comprehend that judicial interpretation and review of the Chmter might necessarily impel an expanded and more activist role for the judicial sector? * For a critical anatys'i of the Supreme Court's approach to decision making prior to the adoption of the Charter, see Paul Weiler, In The Lart Resort (Toronto: Carswell Mettruen, 1974). For an empirical analysis of the court's record of self-restraint in the interpretation of the Bia of see Dale Gibson, \"And One Step Backwards: The Supreme Caurt and Constitutional Law in the Sixties,\" Cmtadian BmReview, Vol. 53 (1967), pp 621474. \" For example, a 1983 anslysis of the Chmrcr suggested that the Supreme Court of Ch& would Iikely continue to exercise the same kind of judicial restraint that chruacterhd the court's of the Bill of Rights. See Berend Hovius and Robert Indeed, according to one constitutional scholar, by sidestepping or overlooking the possible implications of establishing a constitutional footing for the court to exercise judicial review. the federal Liberals ignored the Charter's \"strongest centripetal effect on the Canadian polity.\" Thus, following the adoption of a new constitutional framework, the Supreme Court of Canada possessed quite impressive authority and responsibilities, but hcked clear guidelines or a well-fashioned mindset regarding how such responsibilities might be fulfilled. It as the Charter's political sponsors maintained, patriation of the constitution did not imply an institutional realignment among the various branches of the parliamentary system, the dilemma had become how to engender a judiciary that would actively and effectively protect rights and guarantee national unity, yet would not assume a fundamentally new and ascendant role in the pantheon of Canadian political institutions.\" The predicament facing the court and Canadian society more generally was not Math, The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in the Supreme Court of Canada,\" Cmtadian Bar Review, Vol, 61, No. 1 (March lW), pp. 354-376.

In view of this situation, during the years following the adoption of the Charter, the difftculties of untangling the closely related dimensions of judicial independence, judicial supremacy, judicial review, and judicial activism would become major features of the Canadian constitutional dynamic. Comparative studies of judicial development have sug[gested that the evolution of a high court's role in a political system may be influenced by the interaction of three major considerations: judicial independence, judicial review, and judicial sovereignty (supremacy). While the first of these considerations, the independence of the judiciary, was rather we11 rooted in the Canadian scene by the pt-1982 period, the her two dinsensions would soon be in a state of flux.* While a comprehensive discussion of these important and evolving dimensions of the Canadian constitutional landscape is beyond the scope of this study, it is necessary to the analysis in subsequent sections of this dissertation to briefly consider tbe dimemiom of one of these mncepts, namely, the phenomenon of judicial activism, Fora~Oftk~e~ue~obm~c~1oskey,7~eflectl011~oncheWamn Cow&* little, Bmwn & Ca, 1%7). The potential for judicial activism in Canada was clearly rooted in Section 52 -- the constitutional supremacy ciawe - of the CIultter of ll(ighrs and F'. Stipulating that *the Corntimion of is the supreme law of the land\" this ciawe expressly authorized, in striking convast to the Canadian Bill of Rights, a more expansive exercise of judicial review. Thus, for the first tim in Cvladian eomtitutiod history#* the judicial sector was explicitly authorized to review federal and provincial legislation ad, if appropriate, to dcdare them unconstitutional. Whether the ehmreds declanuion of *cortstitutional supremacy\" would persuade the Supreme Cburt of Canada to aMcn oanstitudonal authority and override the exercise of parliamentary supremacy - and in the p'ooess foster greater judicial aecivism - has been a subject of much .speculation? Despite erpitedcmbIe negative opinion concerning the court's ability to overcome its -judicial ttmeriry,\" judicial statements and dedsiom during tbe and early 1990s offered increasing evidence that thc Supreme Coun of Canada intend& wbik taking a gradual and evoking appracb ta conistitutional interpretaim, to adopt a mare activist stance regarding judicial decision-making. For example, la than one year afrer the Chortmk adoption, .Mr. Jwtice Brian Dickson of the Supreme Court of Canada expressly recognized tbat judicial deference to parkiament had dictated the caun's previowfy timid interpretation of the 1%0 Canadian Bin of Rigkts (the Cbun had only used the Bill of Rights to ididate one out of tbe approximarely 30 federal acts challenged) and admitted that: \"A spirit of uneasiness, even of guiib cotours some of the cases under the BiU of ~ightr.~' He hastened to add however, that @'the Gkmer has replaced parliamentary supremacy with comtjtutional supremacy'\" and that such *thinking and thov misgivings are nmr behind us.\"\"oreover, the Chief Justice signalled that the new constitutional bask for judicial review conrained in Seaion 52 aha placed the judicial branch in a more egalitarian and thus more active position vis-a-vis *the executive and kgistgtive po~~ent* Thc nun sccdon of this chapter will provide a brief overview of the main features of the Charter in the context of tht new Canadian amtitutiod framework The Chanrmof RghfwmfFrPrdamr governs ttgisladoa, aad the actions of govefzllocn~ officials, must conform, The judicial sector is aurhorized to review state laws and actions, and to the extent that they ma). conflict with the Chmm* the coum are empowered to declare that such laws or actions are unconstirutionaI, and therefore of no force and effect.

ACT which provided that real estate transactions tzmdded on a Sunday were invalid. This legislation - which was based on Christian religious principles -- was ruled unconstitutional and struck down by the Supreme Court because, the court concluded, the legislation did not apply to all Canadians (that is, both Christian and non-Christian), and therefore iafringed Section 2's constitutional guarantee of \"freedom of conscience and religion.\" Thus, in an early example of judicial activism, the Supreme Court of Canada concluded that \"to the extent that it binds all persons to a sectarian Christian ideal, the Lad's Day Ad works a form of coercion inimical to the spirit of the Cher and the dignity of all non~hristians.~~ Section 15 sets out the Ckarter's guarantee of equality rights. In order that the federal and provincial gwernments could review and revise legislation that might conflict with the equality rights provisions, Section 15 was proclaimed in force on April 17, 1985, three years after the Climter was formally adopted in 1982. Section lS(1) contains the comtitution's substantive equality guarantees and provides tbat \"every individual is equal More and under the: law ad has the right to the equal pmtccddn anci equal benefit of the laav without dixrimination and, in particularv without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, coiow; religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.\" The carrstitutional framers intendtd that Scaioa (Seeti011 28) (see below). Section 15(2) - the affirmative action clause -- permits the establishment of affirmative action or \"employment equity\" programs, even though such initiatives may technically contravene Section 15(1). The equality rights provisions were widely viewed as being a centrd feature of the Charter, which could potentially have application to a wide variety of social policy issues.56 Sections 7 to 14 contain rights relating to law enforcement and the administration of justice. Many of these clauses either restate or expand on common law or statutory rights, and have been widely used as defenses to allegations of criminal conduct?' These pravisions - which have been characterized as having \"revohtioniztda the administration of criminal law in Canada - were successfully utilized by criminal defense lawyers almost immediately after the Ckuater\"reaactment, and thus Bad an almost immediate impact on the Canadian criminal justice system. Section 7, or the \"due processw clause, guarantees the right to life, liberty, and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with principles of fundamental justice. Section 8 prohibits unreasonable search and seizure, and section 9 forbids arbitrary detention and imprisonment. Section 10 outlines citizen rights upon arrest or detention, including the right to be promptly informed of the reason for the arrest or detention, the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay, and the right to be informed of that right. Section 11 provides the legal rights of a person who is charged with an offence and includes, among other things, the right to be informed witbout unreasonable delay of the specific offence charged, the right to be tried within a reasonable time, and the right to be presumed innocent until prwen guilty according to law in a fair and public hearing. Section 12 guarantees that everyone has the right not to be subjected to cruel and unusual punishment. Section U provides that a witness who testifies in a trial has the right mt to have any incriminating evidence used against him in a subsequent trial. Section 14 provides that any person imlved in a mn proceeding has the right to an interpreter if that pemn does not speak the language used in tbe promdmg, or if the individual is deaf? These rights are listed in Sections 3 to 5 of the Charter. Section 3 guarantees the right of all citizens to vote in federal and provincial elections Section 4(1) sets out the maximum term for elected bodies, except in cases of special circumstances, as provided in section 4(2). Section 5 requires that the Legislatures and Parliament sit at least once every 12 months? Section 6(1), one of the most novel constitutional provisions, stipulates that every citizen has the right to enter, remain in, and leave Canada Moreover, Section 6(2) guarantees that citizens wbo are permanent residents of Canada bave the right to move to, reside, and earn a living in any pravince. Sections 6(3) and 6(4) ; .wide exceptions to these gemmI dd As mentioned earlier in this chapter, Prime Minister Trudeau and the federal government considered minority language education rights to be the centrepiece of the Chimer. Thus, Section 16(1) recognizes English and French as the two official languages of Canada and guarantees equality of status and rights for both languages in areas of federal jurisdiction. Sections 17-22 provide additional provincial language guarantees, and provide specific instances of such rights. Section 23 guarantees minority language education rights where numbers warrant such rights. One of the first major Charter cases launched after its adoption in 1982 concerned Section 23P1 2. In addition to tbe substamive guarantees of rights and freadoms disatssed above, the Chmter also contains several general orienting principles designed to assist the courts in their interpretation of the constitution's specific guarantees. Most important of these orienting principles is Section 1 which provides that: \"The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such reasonable limits prescllid by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.\" How to interpret this section in light of the Chmrer's substantive rights was one of the key issues before the courts very early on in the life of the new constitution. In the 1986 decision of R v. oak' the Supreme Coun of Canada elaborated a two-pan test that set tbe standard for judicial interpretation of the Chmter. The first part of the test comprised the question of whether a substantive constitutional right was infringed. If the answer to this question was in the affirmative, the court then was required to ask a second question, namely, is the constitutional infriagement \"reason= Me\" under Section l? Using this two-part test, a anut could first conclude, for example, that education legislation prohibiting children uaQr the age of 5 from attending public school was contrary to the quality guarantees of the Charter. The cout wdd then be required to apply the second branch of the test, enquiring whether such dammmb . .. 'on was *reasonabk* under Section 1, It after hearing evidence on the issue, the cuurts ooodudcd that be dedared void awl of no force ad effect. If, on the other ha& tbe kgkWw eaacbnent was found to reasonable, then the of discrimination weald be dh&mi Iu addih m Scrdoa I, otbcr general provisiotrr arc found in Section 27 of the Chmter which requires :hat the constitution be interpreted in a manner consistent with Canada's multicultural heritage, and Section 28 which requires genderic equality to be observed in all constitutional decisionmaking. Denominational schooling rights are protected by Section 29, and Section 26 stands for the general principle that constitutional rights %hahall not be construed as denying the existence of any other rights or freedoms that exist in ~anada.~ Section 33 - the opting out or notwithstanding clause - provides that the provincial ltgislatures or the federal Parliament may *opt out\" of specific Charter rights for a five-year period. Thus, Section 33(1) provides Parliament or the l~me of a province may expressly declare in an Act of Parliament or of the legislature, as the case may be, that the Act or a provision thereof shall operate notwithstanding a provision included in section 2 or sections 7 ta 19 of this Ckartat As disused in Part IIl of this dmpter, this very controversial provision was included at the imhtemcc of tbc pnntiwxs during the tbe Secltion 33 ovecde wuuld rarely, if ever, be invoked, si. opting ma of co~tinr- gummeed Charrs rights would arguably expose a government to charges of anti-democratic behaviour. Despite such predictions, the section was almost immediately hoked by Quebec - the only province which was not signatory to the constitution -- in regard to all provincial legislation following the entrenchment of the new constitution. 4. b~licatian of tbe Charter To whom dixs the Charter apply? Section 32 of the constitution states that the constitution applies to matters within the authority of the federal Parliament or provincial Legislatures, but does not apply to acts between private citizensaa Where a government has been found to have infringed the Chmter, section 24(1) states that a citizen may apply to the courts to obtain a remedy which the court considers appropriate and just under the circumstances. V. THE CHARTER COMES TO LLFE: INITIAL EXPEXTATIONS AND TRENDS Once the Charter was adopted, questions naturally arose concerning how Canadian courts and Canadian citizens would interpret and utilize their new constitutional framework. The Supnme Court of Canada darified this principle in the care of Dolphin Delivery v. Refat7, lKWkdk & Lkpl~bnar Stm U. Loc 580, [19.0&1, 2 S.C.R 573. For an adyk of this case as it relates to Section 32(1) of the Chter see, for example, Peter Hogg, \"llbe Dolphia Deliuery Application of the Charter Siab&wm Law Review, VoL \"Dolphia Delivery: Tbc. If judicial activism is understood as the court's inclination or propensity to intervene in the governing process -- a trait which, in comparative terms, is commonly marked by decisions calling for \"social engineering\" and which may intrude on matters traditionally reserved for legislative or executive action - then clearly the potential for its exercise existed in the Canadian context after 1982. Although members of the Supreme Court, including Chief Justice Dickson, suggested in their first Charter judgements that the court would take a cautious and incremental approach to \"judicial law-making,\" the court also indicated that the Supreme Court of Canada's law-making function had taken on an important new dimension since the entrenchment of the Charter of Rights and Freedom. Thus, while the complex and ambiguous notion of judicial activism was perceived as being somewhat foreign to the Canadian legal context, it was just such complexity and ambiguity which offered an opportunity for the lively interplay of various political forces and judicial interpretations in Caaadian society during the 19805 and the beginning of the 199(b The absence of critical discuss'm11~ in Canada about constitutional supremacy and its implications for a more activist high court at the onset of the 1980s provided a striking contrast to the U.S. constitutional experience. Thus, for example, it was exactly the notion of the court \"as the ultimate and effective partisan of constitutional and individual rights\" which US. Chief Justice John Marshall had seized upon to defend the U.S. Supreme Court's assertion of judicial supremacy in the landmark 1803 case of Mudury v. M&o# that would subsequently serve as the basis for the American Supreme Court's activist tendencies. While the Canadian constitutio~ framers may have largely downplayed or neglected the pivotal role of the judiciary in balancing out and adapting the new constitutional system to its broader environment, Canadian Supreme Court justices were far more attuned to comparative constitutional history and to their own potentialities to become an important political force. For example, in its first major consideration of the Charter in the 1984 case of The Low Sociery of Upper Chu& v. ~krrpinker,~' the Supreme Court of Canada -- in what would emerge as a significant step forward in Canadian constitutional development -- explicitly drew attention to the significance of judicial review under Canada's new constitutional framework. Indeed, the court did not hesitate to cite the famous American precedent of MAW v. Mardr'son as a basis for authorizing Canadian courts to review the comtitutionality of I&shtion. On a double-edged note, the amt also relied upon U.S. Justia John Matshall's 1819 decisioa in McCulbd, v. Maykn@ to caution that both 1egkla.h and judicial power \" 1 CrPlKh (5 US) 137 (1&03). \" (198r)), 9 Dm (4th) 161. 17 US 316 (1819). are limited under the Canadian constitution, and that the Supreme Court must allow the legislative branch to exercise the discretion assigned to it (and vice versa). Newly appointed Chief Justice Dickson minced no words, however, in signalling his model for Canada or the Supreme Court's future direction within the Canadkn polity when be indicated his hope that future CMer decisions would \"resound like those of John Marshall.\" Thus in the oourt's unanimous first Charter judgement, written by Mr. Justice Willard Estey, the Supreme Court of Canada went well beyond considering the substantive issues raised in the Skapinker case, and indicated how the justices envisioned their new mnstitutional role and responsibilities. In effect offering guidelines for the judiciary's new approach to constitutional interpretation, Mr. Justice Estey distinguished the nature and force of the 1982 Charter of Rights and Freedom from that of its \"shabbily treatedd predecessor, the 1960 BiU of @$us. Thus, he remarked: We are here engaged in a new task, the interpretation and application of the Charter of Rights und Freedmu.... This is not a statute or even a smte of the extraordinary nature of the Canadian Bill of R&&s.... It is part of the Constitution of the nation adupted by the constitutional process. ...The Chmrer comes from neither level of the legislative branches of government but from the Constitution itself. It is part of the Wric of CaaadiPn law. Meed, it is the supreme law of Canada? In jwWAy cW@@&ing the new comtitutional guarantees of fundamental rights, the ~o~rt fwther asserted that the Charter of Rjgk and Fb would be accorded Fr&dmaq 7k C&( Noabnd, ,%ust interpretation in order \"to better serve\" the Canadian community that \"it is designed to guide ... for a long time.\" A less fulsome interpretation of the Charter, the court cautioned, would \"stunt the! grawtb of the law and hence the community it serves.\" Moreover, adopting judicial reasoning which put to rest any doubts about whether or not the Canadian Supreme Court had embarked on a new and dynamic course of constitutional development, the Canadian Supreme Court justices drew on US. precedent to outline their future approach to constitutional interpretation- Thus, Mr. Justice Estey commented: The courts in the United States have almost 200 years of experience at this task and it is of more than passrOng interest to those concerned with these new developments in Canada to study the experience of the United States m~rr\" M. TME CHARTER AND CXUDLAN PUBLIC EDUCATION: CASE SNDlES IN CONPARATnTE sonee Canadian commentators concluded that the Chmrer, in making explicit reference to limits an rights and freedoms rhat on be Tustified in a fiee and democratic society\" (Section I), invited the courts to look beyond Canadian borders to other demccratic societies for zsristancc in deciding Chmrn issues? In the decade after the Sknpinker case, the Supreme Cwn of Canada would accep this invitation in a large number of coastitutional case:. covering almost all facets af Canadian law and society In referring to and adopting US. case j Cadian courts were cautious, holweve:r, to avoid tbe wbWe importation of US. cornti tut ional reasoning ia ta Canadian clomtitu tionat issues. For example, according to Mr. Juuioc La Forest in the 1981 Supreme Coun of Canada decision of Ra?zq v. 7R.e Queen=\" White it is natural and even desirable for ranadian cams ro refer to American oonuitutional jurisprudence in seeking to elucidate the meaning of Charter guaraow that baw counterparts in rhc Wnittt Surtes Comtitutioq, they be wary of drawing too rcady a parailel beween constitutions born to different counuics in different ages ad in very different 6r- ...- Itgal thought has at many pims in tbe pest &femd to that of the British; the Charrer wili be no sign of wr national manrrity if it simply becomes an urcwe for adapting another inttllecrual mentor, American jurisprudence, like tbe Brit& must be viewed as a to& not as a master,75' The use of American case faw in Ccanadian judicial reasorring since 1982 suggests the utility of studykg and evaluating changer to Canada's legal system and legal mlture from a comparative penpctivc.\" In order to assess the impact of the Cbmer of Righrs Md Fnetdoms on Canadian pubiic education in this dissertation. the Following chapten will examine fbur selected issues concerning Canadian public education, The four case studies are: (1) equal educational oppoltunities for disabled children; (2) reachers and the AIDS and (3) gender equality in the schools; and (1) the role of religion in the public school curriculum. The case studies will take an explicitly comparative approach, looking at the way in which the Cher has influenced Canadian law, and also bow the evolution of American law has affected that impaa, A number of broad orienting questions will guide the analysis undenaken in the comparative case studies: What impact has the new constitution had on educational policies and pmcticm; in Canada? Has the Chmter enmuraged parenu, students and others in the Canadian public education setting to overcome their traditional deference to legislative and 1d school board authority aad to asserr their perceived constirudonal 'righa'' through legal Menges? How have Canadian courts utilized the Uuurwto address the eduation-related rights of Canadian citizens? Hw has the American experience and legal evolution in these areas of public edudon Muenced constitutional development in Canada? What do the illl~rvers to the preceding guestions revcal about Canada's legal culture since the entrenchment of the Charter of Ri@s and Fwedom? These and other questions will guide the analysis in the follawing GW studies. Together the case studies are intended to etucidare the impact of the Chmrer on Canadian public education, and more broadly on the Canadian legal culture. PART XI CHAPTER 3 EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR SPECIAL NEEDS CHILDREN: PARENTAL PRESSURE AND THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONSEQUENCES In 1985 - after a three yew waiting period designad for federal and provincial g;lrvernmcnts to harmoniat kgidah and policies with the coustitution's equality guarantees - th: C'm5 equality prouiriolm in Section IS were enacted. Among other protections, SMtr*on 15 guaranteed that '\"evtry i- *. Phe right to-equal benefit of Freedoms on the right of special needs children, that is children with mental and/or physical disabilities, to an appropriate educational program in the Canadian public school system. In order to place the subject in context, the first section of the chapter provides an ove~ew of legislative and judicial attitudes toward special needs children prior to ahe adoption of the Charm in 1982. Because pt-Chmter developments in the area of student rights for special needs children have drawn heavily on the American experience, the second section of the chapter focuses on U.S. wnstitutional and legislative developments regarding education for handicapped drildren. The third section of the chapter surveys post-Chartet casts that have expanded tbe educational: rights of disabied children in Canada In the fourth portion of the chapter, the statutory rights of disabled children to access +Jlc public sellool system are examined in order to illustrate the way in po5tCAmrer in botb C\"anada's external legal culture (parents) and the internal kgal culture (legislators) have influenced the evolution of prmOvlncial evfucatian legislatioa. Finally* the last section of the chapter sum recent ckmp in the area of special education as such devc~nts have imparted on Cbda's evolving legal ntlaue.

While minority pups other than handicapped Canadians - panialarJy racial and ethnic groups - were also historically denied common law equality rights, public pressure to address the problem of disabled persons has been a relatively recent phenomenon in Canada. For example, all the provinces had enacted anti- djscrimination statutes resQectiag racial and ethru*c minority groups by the end of the 1950s as put of the postwar emphasis on human rights generallyralty It was not until the early 197Q. trowcvtrf that arni-cihcridnation statutes began to address the anachronistic Itgal treatment of thc handicapped, and only in subsequent years that lepidative amendments by all the @nas and the federal government afforded protection Pgaimt discrimination based on lBadap.5 During the nady four decades between the end of World War 11 and the full adoph d the Clrcrrta's equality pmkiom in 1985, Canada beaune a signatory to several internationai rights documents including the WniLersrrl DeclararicM of Human Riglttr.6 the klmmon of the imernarional Covenrmt on Ecm and ~u~uml ~i@s? As executors of these agreements Canada and the provinces expressed at least a moral commitment to every child's right to an appropriate education. For example, Article 13 of the Infematjonal Covenant on Econmic, Socicll and Cultwnl Rights stipulated: 1. The States Parties to the present Covenant recognize the rigbt of everyone to education. They agree that education shall be directed to the full development of the human personality and the sense of its dignity, and shall strengthen the request for bumaa rights and fundamental freedoms. 'ky further agree that education shall enable atl persons to participate effectivety in a free society. 2 Tbe States Mes to the present Covenant rw that, with a view to achieving the full realization of this right: (a) Primary education shall be compulso~y and mle free to all; (b) seamdwy education in its different..shall be made generally available and accessible to all by every appropriav mamP Canada had also expressed a commitment to 3pecial education as elaborated by a number of United Mations Declarations and in many statements issued during the 1981 Year of the Article 16, UN. Doc A/811,1948. Prhdpk 7, UN.G./A Res. 1386 (xiv), Disabled? Norwithstanding Canada's moral cadtment to an appropriate education for all children regardless of ability, a notable gap existed between the principles expressed in universal declarations and actual provincial education legislatioa\" Prior to the adoption of tbe Charter, most education laws tended to provide that a child would be \"accommodated\" in the public schml system, but did not stipulate that such accommodation would be appropriate to the individual needs and abilities of the child. Au example of this minimal entitlement was illustrated by the British Columbia Schod A# which provided: The Board of each school district shall ...p rovide sufficient school accommodation and tuition, free of charge ...to all children of school age resident in that school district.\" Although more expansive entitiemears were available in other provinces1' which recognized that appropriate educztion would vary according to individual children, even these statutes IQ See in fbd. DecIcrrmricur of the Ri@& of fhe 1867 (formerly the BrMh North Ametica Act), stipIatcs that education is a provincial responsibility. * Section lSS(1XaXi). 'Ibc @idation has since been amended as discussed later in this chsntcr. For example, the Sshckwm Emccr*ion Act, RSS 1974 c 17 provided tbat: \"Every pclfson bchveen the age of six and twenty-one years of age shall have the right to attend school in the division in which he and his parents or guardb are residents, and to receive insmtction appfopriatt to his age and level of educational achievement ad in courses of ~~bytbt~ofertucationinschoolorschooIsofthedivisioa, contemplated segregation of handicapped children from their nondisabled peers, and did not typically include provisions for parental involvement in placement and program decisions affecting their children\" Moreover, while most provinces adopted some policies and programs designed to accommodate physically and mentally handicapped children, implementation of such policies and programs was both discretionary and conditional, so that the claim of special needs children to an appropriate education was more appropriately described as a privilege, rather than a right. This situation was typical of Canada's legal culture prior to 1982. For example, the attitudes and views wtpresscd by both legislators and judges during this period of time were characteristically restrained and non-expansive with regard to radical changes in the field of rights - a feature which mitigated against innovation in the area of special education, as well as many other emerging societal problem (see Chapten 4-6). In addition to providing minimal entitlements to education for children with disabilities, many provincial education statutes prior to 1982 atso codneb \"exclwion\" clauses which contemplated that not all children, particularly those witb severe disabilities, woukl be provided accless to \"re dasses in their neighbourhood public school. For examplie, while Section 47(1) of the Prince Edward Island Schooi Aa stated that Ihe Minister shall provide free school privileges.., for every child.. ,\" it also exempted from the rigbt to *free sci~wl prh&ge~. students for whom the Minister has provided spccial semccs such as the deaf, blind and cerebral palsy (sic).\"6 Prior to the adoption of the Chcptez, Oatario was the only province that seriously attempted to bridge the gap between moral pr-ptions and legislative provision of appropriate education for all children. Thus in 1980, the Ontario Government proclaimed navel amendments to its Education Act designed to update and overhaul the pravince's approach to special education. While maintaining segregated sehmls for bliad, deaf and *trainable retarded\" pupils, the new legislation offered that uexceptional pupiis\" - tbat is, those pupils witb \"behavie comrmmicational, intellectual, physical or multiple exceptionalities\" - would be pW in a special education program\" In contrast to other educatiod objectives across the awntry, Ontario's education legislation was intended to etlswe that qc&l needs children received instruction appropriate to their individual needs and capadties The Minister of Education at the time, arplaintd to the Ontatio legislature: This Bill does two thinp: First, the basis for universd access contained witbin this Bill guarantees tbe right of all children, condition notwithstanbing, to be enrolled afier an asasment procedure establishad in Iaw which has in f& denied universality of access. AU children will mnrv havc a basic right to be enrolled. Second, school boards must assume responslity for proriding suitable progtzunming for all fbr its pup&. Although this path-breaking legislation was a significant departure Erom more minimalist provincial entitlements across Canada, even these amendments did not prevent exclusionary treatment of the handicapped in certain cased9 For example. s. W of the Ontario Education Ad enabled a school principal or parent of a child who is \"... because of a mental or a mental and one or more additional handicaps, unable to profit by instruction offered by the board\" to refer the child to a committee of three appointed by the school board This committee, consisting of a psychiatrist and a supervSsory officer or principal, to neither of whom the rosrtter had been previously referred, was charged to determine the extent of the child's disability, and where circucrumces warrant, to assist the parents to locate a suitable proegam outside the public school system, at ao cat to the parent.\" Thc restrictive approach of pre-1982 provincial legislation toward children with dkdilities was reinf~ced in the handtful of oowt cases &at attempted to challenge edusbaq pmvkhl education Ie@dation, For example, although Alberta's education la;M did oot expikitiy exempt certah groups from the rigbt to attend scboot i.e, school bauds were chliged to gdnnit all children with no other distbctb than residcncc, cases of exclusion of disabled children regularly occurred.\" In one of the few preCMer cases illustrative of this situation,*' parents of a child with cerebral palsy who was barred Erom inclusion in a regular class, successfully requested that an Alberta court order that school officials admit the child to a regular classroom on the basis of her residency. Although the court was able to compel the school board to admit the child on the basis of the education Icgislation's residency language, in its limited judicial review competence, the court had no jurisdiction to require school officials to provide the child witb an education \"appropriate\" to her needs once admitted to school. This limited judicial remedy was typical of the pre- lWlZ special education cases,= and illustrated the situation whereby Caoadian courts were empowered to interpret legislation onpmeduralgrounds, but were not empowered to strike down provincial or federal statutes on the basis of a substanfive defect, such as discrimination on the basis of disability (see Chapter 2). Thus, even in cases where provincial legislation blatantly dixriminated against handicapped children with respect to the provision of educational programs and se~oes -- and prior to the entrenchment of the new constitution provincial education legislation across Canada almost universally failed to For a disclrrsion of this situation see, for example, D. Poirier, L Gouguen, and P. L&it, Eiklrtiion R@hts of Ercepibd Children in Canada. C& v. C. of Lummt Na 34 Unreported, August 15, 1978 (Albexta Queen's Bench). \" Ste also~c~igon v, (1973), 41 DU (3d) 57 and; MrtcDonald v. Tire County of MIZp (1979), 30 NSJL (249 863, recognize the right of children with disabilities to an appropriate education -- judicial deference to parliamentary supremacy acted as a constitutional brake to the expansion of rights in the area of special education. Thus, the actors who for many generations had been the prime architects shaping Canada's internal legal culture, that is, members of the legislature, legal community and the judiciary, did not view either the legisl3tive arena or Canada's courts as the prime levers for the expansion of rights, or for satisfying the rights claims of special group constituencies. The orientation of the internal, legal culture, as expressed in part by the narrow scope of judicial review in Canada before 1982 (that is, prior to the entrenchment of the Charter), the expense of instituting legal proceedings, and also the remote chance of successfully challenging provincial legislation were all factors discouraging parents of children with disabilities from seeking judicial redress in cases of discriminatory treatment by the educational system. Such factors also motivated some parents of special needs children to become actively involved in promoting the idea of constitutionally entrenched equality rights for their children during the constitutional debates of the early 1980s. One of the central arguments made by Canadian parents and interst groups lobbying for the expansion of rights for the disabled during the parliamentary debates on the constitution was the American experience with equal educational opportunities for special needs children. In order to place post-Chmter developments into context, the next section of this chapter will briefly dixuss tbe American experience as it relates to both legislative and judicial developments in the area of special education. As in Canada, the be of equal educational opportunities and services for handicapped children has been one of the most important and controversial civil rights issues facing American educators. public interest groups, legislators and the co~rn.~~ The historid provision of educational services for handicapped children by US. state governments was giaringly inadequate, and legidation tended to lack both uniform standards and sufficient financial resources to support available programs. This situation in the United States changed dramaticaw in the early 197h when public interest groups made an end-run around traditionally mrespoasive state legislators and id school boards and mounted successful legal challenges to the systematic exclusion of handicapped children from educaticmal programs. Two significant legat &cisions provided the initial impetus for increased judicial and gavemental attention to the plight of handicapped children figbting for equal educational \" See, for example, Richard K Scotch, ?Disability as the his for a Social Mwement: AdMlcacy and the Politics d Definition,' Zhc Iltsues, Vol. 44 (Spring 19881, pp. 159-172 and by the ram author, \"Politics and Policy in the Hinory of the Disability Rights Movement,\" Mi0td @mer&, VoL 67, Supp. 2, Part 2 (1989), pp. 38o.400. benefit5 in the pu bk school system- case, Pemsy~Mio Axscxriation for Retded v.

In Mills v.

By the mid- 19785, the flurry of legal activity had extended the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment's equaf praeetion clause lo include rhe right of special needs children ts receive ail ehcational services regufarly provided by the state to the non-handicapped, Even as pputar awareness and judicial support of children with disabifities increased in the United States, however, the practical diIemmas of defining equality wittr respect to handicapped children in the educational setting steadily emerged. For example, despite attempts by the states to enact special education laws in response to the PRRC and Mills decisions, it soan became- clear that such Iegislative initiatives were not substantially Emproving educational sewices to the handicapped. This situation prompted Congress to enter the arena and to adiroeate the creation of federal legislation and funding for the education of the handimnsed_ US. Federal imohrement and congressional initiatives came to a head in 1975 when Congress enacted the FJhrr- jm AU Handjcapped Chiklnn Act Public Law (PL) 94-142, shifted the focus from ~o~titutional: to statutory rights by mandating a \"free appropriate public education and related se~~oes'' for all bawlicapped children between the ages five and eighteen.

A central feature of the federal: tegislarion was, that: to tk fullest extent possible, handicapped youngsters were to he educated in the \"least rwtrictive environment,\" that is. in classes with their non- handicapped peers; a process known as full integration or \"mainstreaming.\" The Act also affirmed the principle that a regular classroom setting with appropriate supplemental sctrvices was preferable to special segregated classes; special classes were preferable to separate special schools; and special schools were preferable to pxate institutions in a home setting. In addition, P.L 94-142 provided that where no public facilities were available, private schoofs supplemented by public funds could be used as an alternative, Extensive procedural protections (that went well beyond those stipulated in PARC and Mi&) were also provided by the EAHCA to ensure that placement, evaluation, and program decisions were made in accordance with stringent due process requirements. The Act provided, for example, that a. \"appropriate\" educational program was to be tailored to meet the educational needs of each handicapped youngster. The \"individualized education program* (the IEP) to be developed by school officials was to set out the educational objectives and goals designed for each child and to describe the specific services to be provided. Re-evaluation of the IEP was to be conducted annually. If objections were raised with respect to a particular IEP, parents were entitled to a hearing before a local school For a ciiiion of state legislation in the area of speaal education see, for example.

If this hearing did not result in a satisfactory resolution of the complaint, parents could file a civil suit in state or federal coutt. Although we1 1-intentioned, the sparsely worded Educaton far AII Hudicapped Children Act opened the door to a variety of problems and unanswered questions. In particular, because P.L. 94-142 failed to consider what in fact and practice constituted an \"appropriate education\" parents and school officials often found themselves at laggerheads when it came to the practical implementation of the legislative provisions, Parents and school boards unable to arriw at a satisfactory resolution of such issues turned to the courts to flesh out the meaning of the EAHCA Almost 300 federal and state cases involving P.L. 84-142 were heard before the U.S. Supreme Court finally entered the fray in 1982 when the aurt rendered the first authoritative decision on the meaning of an *appropriatew education for handicapped children in the case of fiendrick Hudson District of Education v+ ~owfey.\" In that case, the Court concluded that an \"appropriateM education, as provided by PL. 94-142, only required insm&on targeted at achieving a \"beneficial\" result, and dws not require maximization of the students' potential \"commensurate with their non- handicapped counterparts.J1 Such a narrow interpretation of \"appropriatem education was regarded by many as a limitation on the xope of P.L. 94-142, however, even critics of the a 358 U.S. 176 (1982).

Canada's mudern constitutional framers would later acknowledge that it was these groups and individuals who literally \"shamed\" provinces and federal governments into including in the constitution's equality rights provisions, gumtees for mentalIy and physically disabled ~anadiam.~ Nonnrithstanding this successti1 lobbying effort, Canada's legislative and judicial regarding educational opportunities for children with disabilities made special education activists oniy cautiow,ly optimistic about the positive impact nf the Charter on the expansion of special education rights. For exzmple, in a representative statement made by a. spokesperson far one special needs lobby it was suggested that: The implementation of Section 15 provisions in the educational system of British Calumbi9 is effectively resisted by agencies with whose resources we cannot begin to conqme. I believe fhe resolution of tbis confiict will await specific decisions of the Supreme Court of thmda - a very expensive, slow and laborious process ....

Such a discrepancy, or lack of synchronization, between the two sub-areas of Canada's legal culture, however, was not surprising. Generally speaking, members of the legal profession, political practitioners, and the judiciary are more cautious about embracing new approaches to complex societal problems than the activists who speak for rights-seeking constituencies. But the gap was closing in Canada, as legislative spokespersons responded to entreaties on the part of rights groups, and as the legal community and judiciary began to give substance to the new constitutio~al guarantees which explicitly recognized the rights of minority groups. Thus, after the adoption of the Charter in 1982 the complex issue of accommodating the educational needs of disabled children within the public education system was the focus of numerous legal challenges and judicial comment. Notwithstanding that the courts had not definitively ruled that the constitution or human rights legislation was applicable to school boards (see Chapter 7), these challenges were generally brought by parents of special needs children against local boards of education.36 The new constitution's guarantee of Roman Piontovslry, Executive Director, Vancouver Association for Children with bdng Disabilities, interview with author, December 12, 1985.

For example, in srark contrast to the preCIz~er yean, on the tint day of the 1989 school year the emotionafty charged integration issue atwacred national attention wher; two familiz~ residect in twa different Ontario school districts brought their handicapped children to school, and according to one media repon *&red r bod oIG& to tm them aw~y.\" In both cases &ml officials hatd toid the parem that their children would be denied access to their neighburhood schaok. Both sets of parents challenged these decisions in two separate legal actiom. Since 1982 many of the court cases initiated by parents of handicapped chiiCcen have involved the contention that ryisabIed children have a mnstitutional right to be fully integrated into regular class~ooms, and ta receive an education with thcir nan-handicapped peers. Thus, in several of tbe past-1982 special education Wlenges, parents of special needs children have maintained that the least restrictive environment for educating children is provided by full integration of special needs youngsters into regular classrmms, a opj~~d to placement in a segregated school. a segregated class within a regular shad, or other settings This pr-ition dlegedly was suppmed by Section 7 of the Chmer, which gpafaatees \"the right to life, liberty and security of the penon\" (and which, it was argued, indudes a quality education), and ah Section 15, which provides that every individual must receive equal benefit of the law regardless of any mental or physical disabilities. For their part tocat s&wl boards across Canada - who by the eark~ 1990s had almost aII maved to a more iodusionary model of education - contended that integration of all special needs children was not always practicable, nor in the bcst interests of the handicapped child. For example, in one pstCharter case where parents of a severely handicapped child oppased the school board3 decision to partially integrate the youngster in a regutar ciaxsrarrrn setting, the tribunal hearing the case observed: It is the firm opinion of this Tribunal that the wholesale integration of exceptional pupils into regular classes solely on tbe basis of philosophical principle, untempered by due and informed consideration of each individual situation, is directly counter to the best interests of dl pupils. Further, it is the conviction of the Triibunal that the assumption of rigid docuioaire positions on the issue, not only threatem the very Future of integration as a desirable practice but specifically, in cases such as [this], serves only ts erode tbe god dl and reason that must obtain if all parties are to act in her best interestsa Parents and support groups rejected this kind of reasoning, arguing that the Cher implies that all handicapped children are entitled to a fully integrated education, and that school bards do not have discretion in making placement and educational plan decisions. Notwithstanding the current positive attitudes expressed by parents toward integration, it can be anticipated that as full integration of handicapped children becomes the norm in the Canadian public school system, legal challenges will be initiated which may argue, for example. tbat children with disabilities who are required by local school boards to be fully integrated are being denied an appropriate education, because they are nor being placed in a scgrtgattd setting with a low pupil-teacher rado serviced by a specid education teacher.

One of the first special education cases to be litigated following the entrenchment of the constitution was the 1984 case of Bales v* &wd of Schsd Tluftees of Sdrooi Dirm'cr ~kzvuzgan).~ The Bales case concerned an eightyear-oId student named Aaron Bales, wbose mental age was la tban half his yem because of a brain dysfunction that occurred in his infancy. In the fall of 1983 school officials removed Aaron fiom the regular school he had been attending, and, against his parents' wishes, assigned him to a special segregated school for the handicapjmi When school officials rcfuscd to allow Aaron to return to an integrated placement, his parents brought a Chmter challenge in the B.C. Supreme Court requesting that the court compel the school board to return Aaron to the special class in the regular school he had been atte2ding for three years prior to his reassignment Lawyers for the Bales contended that the school board had no authority to operate a segregated school for handicapped children such as Aaron, and maintained that his assignment to such a school denied him the right to aa education with his non- (1984). 8 Admin LR. 202 (B.C.

Moreover, GafonS parems asserted that his attendance at the special school for the handicapped would not merely be less beneficial to him than continued attendance at the ordinary ,schaol where he was previously registered but would acrually be harmful: to him. Because Aaron's rcasignment took place prior to the coming into force of the constitution's equality guarantees in 1985, the Bafes were at a serious disadvantage in making out their elaim of discrimination without the assistance of Section 15 of tbe Cltortet. Consequctrrtly the Bales were limited to making procedural arguments pursuant to Section 7 (which guarantees \"life, liberty and freedom of the person*). In the first Canadian superb am decision to comprehensively tdne the concept of educational \"mainstreaning\" and Arnen'm special education laws, Mr. Justice Taylor reiucrantly concluded that while educational, sociologica& d other expert evidence supported the argument that Aaron would benefit from continued enrollment in a regular scbt and integration in a regular classroom setting, he could not intervene because the decision of the school board wasmduraUy correct. Moreover, he ruled, because the court had no authority at tbat time to determine whether provincial legislation and board policy were sbstantivelj) flawed, the student's reassignment to a segregated setting constituted a hwful exercise of the placement authority given to the school board by the B.C. Scfrod Act. TI.lus, in dislnissing the Bales' claim, Mr. Justice Taylor held that the operation of a segregated scbool for the haadiwd was within the gemral authority of the school board as pmvided by Section 160(h) of the Scturol Ad. As su& the court remarked tbat the xfiool board had followed correct procedufaj requirements as it had: Nthough the Bates farnib fast their case on technical lepi gtounds, they wan a mural victory when in his concluding remark +Mr, Justice Taylor ackaowJedgcd that it was the delay in tbe implementation of the Charier? equality guarantee& and not the validity of the Bales' claim that had determined his decision. In a rue czw of judicial frankness -- and in language which foreshadawed the type of judicial activism which would be sparked by the CAmret- - Mr, Justice Taylor went on to endorse the substantive merits of the Baics' allegation that Aaron's segregated placement was discriminatory: la the circumsm as I have fbund them, the question of whether Aaron wght to receive tbe benefiks which isteptbn is thought to providcl in the education of the h;andi<.apped is not a question which a Cmn may &ci& ....

The consent order issued by the court provided that Luke could continue attending regular classes until he began high school, and also established an \"educational support team\" and special individualized program in order to meet Luke's educational needs. It was the consems of both panis that if the matter had proceeded to trial, Section 15 of the Chmm could have been successfully employed by the Elwoods to challenge Luke's segregated placement, 'Thus, although the case \"settled\" it has consequently been treated as a landmark case, arid used by other parents and interest groups as precedent to support other Charm cases challenging board decisions to segregate children with disabilities.\" Another high prome special education case followed close on the heels of the Elwood settlement. In the 1987 Ontario case of Row v.

Planned integration opportunities as appropriate were to be developed in order to allow the youngster to interact with her non-handicapped age- appropriate peers during the remainder of the school day. The Rowetts, however, believed that their daughter should be entitled to full integration in a regular classroom and requested the Ontario High Court to grant a declaration stating that the placement decision of bath the school board and the provincial government violated the child's constitutional rights to equality pursuant to Section 15, and freedom of assoct*ation under Section 2(d). In the fall of 1!W& an Ontario District court ruled in favour of the school board and province, and dismissed the Rowett's case? In its judgement, the court made a number of important observations. First, the court mied that the local placement committee which had reviewed the student's records and made the placement decision was not a court of 'competent jurisdictioq\" and therefore the Charter was not applicable to the school board's plmrnent decision. Secondly, the court concluded that tbe decision of the provincial special education triinals - which was statutorily empowered to adjudicate appeals from local placement decisions - were hnal and binding, unless the tri'bunal acted &rarily or capriciously or outside its statutory jurisdiction.

Finally, the court determined that the committee had reached the retocation decision in full and proper exercise of its jurisdiction and statutory duties under the Ontario School Act and regulations, and that the Rowett placement decision was consequently not reviewable. In the Rowett's appeal to the Ontario Court of Appeal, the central argument advanced was that the Iower amat bad erred in finding that school board appeal policies and decisions are not subject to the Chmrer of Rigitts and Freedoms.

Human Rig& Act. Specifically, the parents claimed that their daughter should be integrated with students who were her neighburhood playmates, which the parents considered to be children enrolled in Grade 4 and who were 8 and 9 years of age. Far its part, the School bard believed that the younjper should be placed in a fully integrated age appropriate setting (Grade 6) with appropriate in-class suppun and extra-class resources such as speech therapy and specialized educational assistance After extensive consultation with the parents and professionals about the student's educational program and placement options, the School Board failed to reach a satisfactory agreement with the parents. The Board then directed that the student be placed in an integrated educational program with appropriate in-class and extra-class sup6 in an age-appropriate setting. With respect to the issue of appropriateness the Board argued that: It is ...the School Board's educational opinion that [the student] should be placed in a reasonably age-appropriate setting in order to continue her schoohg in the public education system. To place [ber] with children wbo are four or five years younger, would in terms of the Ministry of Education and [the] School Board's policy and practice, be discriminatory and would deny her the opportunity and the right to become involved with and be treated in ways consistent with her same-age peed9 Tht parents rejected tbe Board's placement options, arguing that the 13-year-old should be placed with children who were more dwty proximate to her mental, and not chronological * Submissions by tbc Borrd of School Trustees of School Dinria No. 63 (Saanich) to the B-C Muman Rights Cauocil(l!B2). age. The Human Rights Council ruled in favour of the School Board, concluding that school officials had not discriminated against the handicapped child. In particular, the Council determined that an age appropriate placement in an integrated program in the student's neighbourhood schorzl with appropriate special education resources would properly accommodate the student, and was not a discriminatory pla~ement.~~ As demonstrated in the cases discussed earlier, the manner in which Canada's judiciary and legal community were responding to the demands of children with disabilities was occurring rather incrementally, largely owing to the prolonged and complex nature of court and tribunal cases involving the area of special eduction. But momentum was clearly moving in the direction of expanded rights for minority groups, and the emergence of a new rightsoriented jurisprudence as a core trait of the Canadian legal culture. SPECIAL EDUCATION AND THE B.C. SCHOOL ACT: RIGHTS CONSCIOUSNESS AND PARENTAL PRESSURE The mounting tide of parental pressure on school boards to expand the education rights of children with disabilities through Chmter and human rights challenges also influenced Canada's provincial legislatures to review and revise statutory provisions governing the delivery of educational services to all children. In this section of the chapter - \" The B.C. Human Rights CMlntil is currently considering another case of alleged dixrimination on the basis of disability against a school board in the matter of AdPmer and Bovvli of &fwd Tll~~tees qf case involves several alI@om, including the parent's daim that her son, who she says has a severe hearing loss, was aot provided witb a Frersdwpeaking interpreter for the deaf in his advanced French classes.

Despite commitments expressed by the federal government and provincial governments that the period from 1982 to 1985 would be used to review and revise legislation in anticioation of the constitution's Section 15 equality provisions coming into force, there was no immediate reaction by provincial ministries of education to revise public school statutes during this three year waiting period. In British Columbia, for example, just one month prior to the adoption of constitutioeal equality rights on April 17, 1985, the Attorney General, Brian Smith expressed a cautionary approach to the Cluurerk equality provisions remarking: \"We've gone too far down the road in Canada in the last five years of emphasizing people's rights and not their re~ponsibilities.~' Although the cow had not yet clarified whether policies or decisions made by local schoot hds were subject to review under the Ciumer of Rgh& and Freedom, by the rnid- 1980s the mrts clearly required legislative provisions to meet the standards prescribed by the constitution. It was this consideration, and also extremely strong parental pressure, that prompted the education law reforms in British Columbia Thus, just four years after the provincial Attorney-General made his cautionary remarks, British Columbia - which had s' Vmcouver Sun, March 21,1985. one of the most restrictive legislative frameworks regarding the accommodation and idWn of special needs children in the pubiic school system - completely revised its education legislation to provide a far more rights-oriented model of educational services to dl children. In the immediate post-Charter period parents of children with disabilities in British Columbia became very active in promoting the idea that all children had the right to be accommodated equally in the public school systemS2 Thus, lobby groups in B.C. pointed to the Bales and Elwood cases as examples of constitutional challenges that they would bring against local school boar& and the province if legislative policies and practices were not revivd to harmonize with the ~hmter?~ In view of the new rights climate emerging in the late 1980s, in 1988 the British Columbia Royd Commission on Education reammended that educational programs for all children should focus on and be tailored to the unique abilities of the individual leamer. Such individualized child-centred programs would, it was suggested, provide the most enabling educational environment for students enrolled in the public school system, and would take into account the rights of all children. The Education Mir&trfs 1989 Mission Statement in the Mmrdate fw the School System, reinforced the Royal Commission's philosophy with its declaration that students now \"have the opportunity Some of these interest gmups included, Parents for Integration, the B.C. Arrociation for Community Living, the Family Support Institute, the B.C. Coalition of Human Rights, and the Vancower association for Adults and Children with J-.eaming Disabilities. The provincial Educatiod Advisory co-ttee struck to advise tbe J5ducation Ministry on changes to the prqaed &cation legislation included a representative from an interest group associated with the expansion of rights for dicabled children. In botb these cases the pareas were pmvidtd with moral and other support from public *rest: oqanmmm . . which promoted the rights of disabled cM&ea 105 to avail themselves of a quality education consistent with their abilities.\" The revamped 1989 khml Act that grew out of the Royal Commission was also based on the premise that the most enabling environment can be achieved by focusing on the educational plan best suited to individual learners. In the area of special education, the School A# and related programs and policies all emphasized that school board decision-making regarding the delivery of special education programs and resources would occur on an individualized basis in order to place disabled children in the most enabIing educational setting according to each child's specific capabilities and needs. ln a significant departure from earlier restrictive legislation, policies and programs regarding sped needs children, and in direct response to an aggressive lobbying effort by parents of special needs children, the new B.C. &hod Act suggested that whenever possible and appropriate, special needs students would be entitied to full integration in regular classrooms in their neighbourhd schools in order to facilitate \"the achievement of learning goats and an enhanced self-concep\" While the revamped ScM Acr did not totally satisfy handicap lobby groups and parents, the new legislative provisions for full integration of special needs children in a regular classroom setting, the requirement for input from parents concerning the design and implementation of educational program for children with disabilities, the right of parents to appeal schml- d other decisions regarding the provision of educational services, induding placement decisioars, and the deletion of exclusionary provisions for *mentally reurnfed\" studcnu, all contnhted to a much more rights-oriented comparison with the previous legislation. 2, A Transformation of the Intemd Led Culture: -1atiw Cm in tu School Act The 1989 School Act provides that all children in British Columbia who meet age and residency requirements are entitled to an educational program in the public school syJteml5 An \"educational programm is defined as \"an organized set of learning activities that, in the opinion of the board is designed to enable learners to develop their individual potential and to acquire the knowledge, skilIs and attitudes needed to contribute to a healthy society and a prosperous and sustainable economy.\" In addition to these basic educational access rights the legislation also stipulates that schad boards shall make available an educational program to all persons of school age resident in their districts who enroll in schools in the distictS7 In contrast to the old School An - which only required that school bards provide \"sufficient accommodation and instruction to students - the 1989 legislation places a new responsibility on school boards to accommodate the rights of all children by providing individualized, \"appropriate\" and not merely 'sufficientJ8 educational Section 2 .(6 Section t the case of Ananwn v.

In a last-minute response to strong interest group lobbying efforts based upon the moral and constitutional provisions of the Charter, the provincial legislature limited school bard discretion regarding the delivery of educational programs by the introduction of a novel ministerial order.* Thus, Minister's Order 13/89 requires that school boards ensure that school principals encourage parental consultation regarding placement decisions affecting special needs children. The Order also requires school boards to presume, as a matter of policy, that special needs students will be integrated into regular classrooms, unless the \"educational needs\" of the student suggest other~ise.~' Order 13/89 provides: requirements. \"If it were not so,\" the court has observed, \"the right would seem, for practical purposes, meaningless.\" 59 While there is a presumption that school boards will provide all learnen with access to public education, school officials are still able to exercise considerable discretion with respect to the specific educational program design, placement and delivery decisions. For exampie, section 1 stipulates educational programs will be provided to students that, \"in the opinion of the board,\" are designed to enable learners to achieve their individual potential. Moreover, the right of school boards to assign students to specific educational programs, and make specific placements is addressed in section 94(4) of the School Act so as to allow bards to \"assign and reassign students to specific schools and educational programs.\" Regulation 5(7)(b) further provides that the principal of the school is responsible for \"administering and supervising the school including the \"placing and programming of students in the schoolw. * lhis ministerial order was one of the only provisions that was not vetted with the various stakeholder groups prior to the 1989 School Act's adoption, and was introduced to the legislation at the eleventh hour by the Minister of Education. A limitation to a student's right to enroll in an educational program in a public school setting is mandated by section 109 of the Act. Section 109 provides that a school board may exdudt a student from school if a dm01 board medical officer declares that the child is sufferi~g from a communicable disease or other physical, mental or emotional condition that would endanger the health or weIfare of the otber students. In the event that a student is remaved hm school for aq of the above reasons, however, a board must continue to make amhble an educational program to that student (section 103 (2)(d)). A child may also be Handicapped students (1) A board shall ensure that an administrative officer offers to consult with a parent of a handicapped student regarding the placement of that student in an educational program. (2) Unless the educational needs of a handicapped student indicate that the student's educational program should be provided otherwise, a board shalt provide that student with an educational program in classrooms where the student is integrated with other students who do not have handicaps. As a corollq to Order 13/89, Section 103 of the Act requires that \"a board may ... subject to the orders of the minister approve educational resource materials and other supplies and sewices for use by students.\" Section 106(1) further stipulates that a board \"shall provide health services, social se~ces and other support services for schools in accordance with any orders made by the minister\". Order 12/89 provides boards to assume significant responsibility for providing students with support services, including: 1) referring students who are hearing-impaired to the Minister of Health (section 2); 2) providing speech and language therapy se~ces for students of school age who attend a school in the district \"whose education is adversely affected by oral communication difficultiesw (semon 3); 3) assessing and refemng students for occupational or physiotherapy consultation (section 4); 5) providing trained staff to supervise and maintain \"complex medical proceduresn if such procedures are carried out in the school (section 5). These sections have fundamentally excluded from school if he/she proves to be so disruptive that he endangers the ability of his peers to benefit from education. Under section 103(2)(c) of the Schod Act, for example, a board has the authoriw to discipline a student for unsuitable behaviour, which may include excMing a student from class. expanded the legislative entitlement of physically handicapped students to appropriate resources which, in the opinion of the board, will enable the student to develop hislher individual potential. Finally, an appeals section in the School A& provides parents and students with the new statutory right to appeal decisions and non-decisions which \"significantly affect the education, health or safety of a student.\" Such appeals may apply to a variety of special education decisions including evaluation, assessment, identification and placement decisions, educational program design, provision of support services, physical facilities, and transportation.\" Since the adoption of the 1989 legislation, parents of special needs children in B.C, have continued to bring pressure to bear on local school boards to provide what are viewed as children's constitutionally protected rights to free appropriate public educational opportunities. In 1992, for example, one of the major interest groups for disabled children, the B.C. Association for Community Living (BCACL), launched a provincewide project which had as its stated objective: 'To enable and empower parents of children with mental handicaps, along with their children and community members, to ensure access to integrated and inclusive education under the British Colwnbia School The BCACL stated that this objective was to be met, in part, by providing \"written information to parents throughout \" When th provincial Ombudsman was given jurisdiction wer sehook in tbe fdl of one of her hrst actions was to release a list of contrwersial \"Guidelines* to school bauds setting out what she coosidered to be the required practice in order to ensure students' procedural rights. \" Funding Application Summary to che British Columbia Law Foundation, September 5, 1991, p. 1, the province on how changes made to the SchwI ,4ct affect children witb.hindiapW and to doeurnear \"the legal options available to families and a frmewwk Br developing successful legd strategies to ensure access to integrated educatian (eg. appeals, Human Rights Commission, Charter challenge, etc.).\" According to the organization it was essential that parents of specid needs children be provided with information which would enable them to effectively defend and expand the rights of their children to equal educational opportunities: Parents theoreticaHy have recourse tu several mechanisms bond an appeal (eg.

Mareover, supporters of broader rights for children with special needs -- taking a cue from their counterparts in the United States -- took *concrete steps\" to expand those rights by initiating Charter challenges and human rights cases, and alsu by successfuJIy lobbying Id school boards and provincial legislators to revamp legislative provisions regarding children with disabilities. As demonsuattd in this chapter's case study, the Canadian legal system and various Ievets of government (the internal legal culture) tcspunded to such daims by assuming a much more activist role in recognizing and expanding the education-related rights of chiidren *with special needs. The combination of enhanced rights conxiousness on the part of parents and interest group activists (the externat legal culture) as it related to the rights of children with disabilities, and the positive response of the internal legal culture (lawyers, judges, Iegislators, etc) to such demands revealed a fundamental chqe in the way citizens regard the rigSlts of Canadians with disabilities, thereby reflecting early inferential evidence of a signiffcant change in Canada's legal culture. Although definitive conclusions of a causal nature cmmt be adduced from the qualitative trend analysis presented abave, there is smng evidence from the case study that the legal system and legal culture is undergoing a sipificaat transformation BWCmG HARDSHIPS: TEACHERS' RIGHTS AND THE AIDS CRISIS On the one hand, tiwe ir the hportmt goal of protecting public health in the face of m a yet incurable and fatal &ease. ... On the other ham$ there is the importam goal of protecting the rights of individuals, whether they be AIDS pderrts, penom who have ttcrted mibody positivef or porn who am perceived to be infected or likely to so become. If epidemics wreck havoc with systematic policy-making processes, they are even more disruptive to civil liberties and human rights. In madern liberal democracies, the trealment of the victims of infectious diseases raises questions concerning citizens' mobility rights (e-g., the right not be placed in quarantine), medical testing, confidentiality of records, not to mention the rights of citizens to receive public se~ces, pursue their occupations, and freely interact with other individuals in society. The innate conflict between the rights of the community and individual rights looms large when an epidemic occurs in modern democratic regimes, especially those having operative constitutional charters which address human rights and freedorm. This chapter will focus on the responses of the Canadian and American public edwath systems to the AIDS (-red Immune Deficiency Syndrome) crisis, or what is now commonly referred to as the \"plague of the century.\" More specifically, the chapter will explore legal and educational policy responses to the AIDS epidemic, with special attention &voted to the impact of the AIDS crisis on teachers' rights. Coincidentally the advent of the international AIDS epidemic occurred at precisely the same time that major constitutional change and rights consciousness were acquiring a higher profile in Canada- Although up to mid-1993 the Charter of Rights and F~edonts had not been explicitly used in Canada by AIDS victims claiming discriminatory treatment, the notion that all Canadians have constitutionally entrenched \"rights\" and particularly the mnstitutional right to be treated equally before and under the law regardless of physical handicap, indirectly impacted on the range and scope of human rights AIDS cases that were initiated by Canadians &ring the decade after 1982. Thus although the Charter was not the particular legal instrument used to advance AIDS discrimination cases -- most challenges were initiated pursuant to provincial human rights legislation or through the collective agreement grievance process - this chapter will demonstrate that the enhanced rights consciousness among Canadians triggered in large part by the adoption of the Charter has had a direct impact on citizen activism in advancing what are perceived to be inalienable wnstjtutional rights. Owing to the enormous scope of the AIDS epidemic in the United States, as compared to Canada, AIDS-related rights claims tended to be initiated much earlier on in tbe American experience with tbc epidemic, Interestingly, many of the first landmark cases defirdng the rights of AlfDS victims generally conoerned civil rights cases relating to students aod teachers barred from classrooms in the public education sector, When Canada's first MDS cases were first advanced in 1987, these important American public education cases had already resulted in a considerable body of judicial, legislative and policy precedents that were frequently utilized or referred to by Canadian decision-makers adjudicating AIDS- related rights claims. In view of such trends, this chapter will begin by discussing the evolution of AIDS cases in the American public education system, and will then detail how those caws and others impacted on the issue of AIDS and rights that arose in the Canadian public education system, Tbe chapter concludes with a discussion of how citizen rights claims arising from the AIDS epidemic have influenced Canadian legal culture. 11. THE AIDS CRISIS IN PERSPECITIT The rapid spread of infectious diseases through non-immunized populations has been a major force in historical development. From the Black Death of the Middle Ages to the mass smallpox and influenza outbreaks during the 19th and 20th centuries, epidemics have resulted in enormous social, economic and political disruption, often with protracted consequences for the Societies affected. Although long underestimated by historians, serious epidemics are now recognized as more than simply \"background noise\" to conventional &tal dynamics, As William H. McNeill demonstrated in his groundbreaking study Pft;pqrces d Peoples, patterns of disease circulation have been a crucial aspect of human affairs from anciem to modern dmes. Indeed as McNeill puts it, human 'lives and communities are \"caught in a precarious equilibrium between the microparasitism of disease organisms and the macroparasitism of large-bodied predators, chief among which have been other human beings.\"' As unpredictable and disruptive historical episodes, major epidemics are the bane of policy-makers and sequential policy-making. Faced with a major public health challenge and abnormal mortality patterns, public decision-makers must rapidly improvise policy responses. When confronted with a dearth of information on a strmge and temporarily incurable virus, there is no time to engage in conventional stages of policy-making or careful forward- planning. While progress in science and bacteriology has removed much of the terror that accompanyied epidemics in ancient and medieval times, the spread of deadly infectious diseases can still engender considerable angst and tension. Modem man, just as his less technically astute ancestors, remains susceptible to what one historian called the \"feeling of complete helplessness in the face of mysterious perils.\" Fearing the unknown and the seemingly mcuable, policy-makers and public institutions are placed under enormous pressure to find solutions and restore calm and routine to the community. Indeed, the pressure and expectations exerted on the policy-making process by a highly contagious &ease spreading through a mn-immunized population is essentially like any other major societal disaster sucb as aa earthquake or tornado. What begins as a public health problem ' William H. McNeiU, Plagues and Peoples (Garden City, New York Anchor Bwks, lW6k p. 5.

York: Bantam Editio~ 1%5; original . . 1935). assumes economic, social, political, legal and moral dimensions, mobilizing the diverse interests and prejudices of the entire society. The same crisis would also become a contributory factor, along with other pressing issues in society, accelerating major changes in the Canadian legal culture. In early 1981, several Los Angeles men were diagnosed as having a very rare form of pn~umania.~ During the same time period, an outbreak of an equally rare form of skin cancer was also reported in the Los Angeles areaS In both cases, the victims of these unusual opportunistic infections were male homosed. The medid community considered the appearance of these infections in otherwise healthy individuals as highly unusual, since both infections were usually associated with patients, such as organ transplant recipients, having severely depressed immune systems. In June 1981, the National Center for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta issued a report which discussed the unusual Los Angeies cases. Within one year, the incidence of these infections among male homosexuals and intravenous drug users became routine and widespread. It soon became apparent that, ia each case, a previous& healthy individual somehow acquired an unidentified virus (later ideatified as HIV) which anaked and devastated the immune system, leaving the victim unprotected against any infections. By September 1982, the CDC recognized that the medical community was coping with an outbreak of a distinctive and new disease, which they labelled, Acquired Immune Deficiency or \"AIDS.~ By 1983, the CDC identified high risk groups as male homosexuak, intravenous drug users, Haitians, haemophiliacs, infants born to infected mothers, and recipients of transfused blood. Throughout the following decade, AIDS continued to be a disease chiefly affecting men who have homosexual sex or who are intravenous Qug users- For example, the CDG reported in 1993, that 51% of the AIDS cases in the United States during 1992 involved men who were homosexual and bisexual.' However, in 1993, the CDC also reported that for the first time the incidence of the disease among other groups, partieulvly young children8 and women, was assuming much higher proportions. For example, of the 47,095 AIDS cases reported in the U.S. during 1W2, the rate for women rose 9.7% over the previous year, or nearly four times the 2.5% rate increase for men? In 1993, just twelve years after the release of the first 1981 CDC report on the mysterious Los Angeles cases, the organization estimated that over one million Americans were infected with the HN virus, and that 170,000 people in the U.S. had died During the early stages of the AIDS epidemic, the disease was labelled as Gay Related ImmUILOClefiencey or GRID, as if it were an inherently gay disease. New YonC Tics, July 23, 1993, p. A6. In a \"frank d explicitm report on the state of the A[DS epidemic in the V.S., Dr. Antonia Novello, the outgoing US. Surgeon General, warned that the AIDS virus is spreading *silently and insidiw into new communities, rural areas, and small cities, and among more and more women and young children, and among rising numbers of teenagers and pung adults. For example, during the past two years, there has been a 77 percent rise in tbe U.S. of AIDS among youngsters between the ages of 13 and 21. San Francisco Cbmklev June 7,1993, p. A2 from the disease. Global trends in the incidence of AIDS were equally striking.'' For example, in 1993, the World Health Organization estimated that 14 million people throughout the world were infected with HIV. The organization also estimated that by the end of the 1990s another 20 million people would become infected with the AIDS virus.\" As of mid-1943, no treatment existed which was capable of either suppressing the multiplication of HIV within an infected individual, or in reconstituting the immune system once it has been shattered, and no vaccine has been developed to protect individuals who had not yet been exposed to the AIDS virus.\" The relative incidence of AIDS was much lower in Canada than in the United States or other countries.13 At the end of 1992, for example, 7,282 lo For a discussion of the global dimensions of the AIDS epidemic see, for example, Anke k Ehrhardt, Trends in Sexual Behavior and the HW Pandemi~\" American Jod of Public Health, Vol. 87 (November 1992), pp. 1459-1461 and Andrew D.

In the United States, for example, the Senate apprcwed the AIDS Fedemf Pdicy ACZ of I987 which provided for a program of AIDS education, treatment and research at a cost of up to $1 billion.

North America in the late 1970s. AIDS is defined by the CDC as \"an acquired immune deficiency syndrome in association with evidence of exposure to the human T-cell lymphotropic retrovirus type 111 in a person who is not otherwise at risk for developing an immune deficiency syndrome.\"21 The virus, HTLV-ILI, was first identified by researchers at the U.S. National Institute of Health in 1984.~ The HTLV-111 virus has been isolated in blood, semen, tears, saliva and sweat. There is no evidence, however, that AIDS is spread through airborne transmissions, such as a sneeze or cough, or through regular contact with infected tears, saliva or sweat (i.e., My fluids not routinely introduced into the bloodstream). Medical evidence has also suggested that ADS is not transmitted through casual contact such as hugging, kissing, sharing telephones or restrooms. The CDC has therefore narrowed the methods of contagion to transfers of blood and semen. The virus may only be transmitted if the infected body fluids of one person are transmitted into the 'bloodstream of another individual. The medical consensus up to mid-1993 was that HIV could only be transmitted from person to person in one of four ways: (1) sexual trznsmissions; (2) transplants of tissues Centres for Disease Control Guidelines, \"Education and Foster Care of Children Infected with Human T-Lymphotropic Vim Type IIIILymphadenopathy-Associated Virus,\" August 30, 1B5 (hereafter referred to as the CDC Guidelines). The HTLV-III vinw causes reduced cellular immunity. The virus affects one specific white bl-I3 type (T-lymphocyte) which normally attacks viruses, fungi, parasitic infections, and cancer. As a result of the breakdown in T-lymphocytes, the AIDS patient first becomes unusually vulnerable to opportunistic infection which present a variety of sympto~lls itssociated with ARC (AIDS Related Cornpiex). Later, as the disease progresses, the patient becomes debilitated by viral and fungal illnesses common in the general public but deadfy to the AIDS patKnt Duriag the first stages of the disease, patients usually died within 3 years of diagnosis. More recently, bowever, the dixovery of new drugs has considerably prolonged the lives of patients infected with the virus. or transfusion of blood products which are infected with the AIDS virus; (3) sharing of contammated needles or syringes; (4) transmission from an infected mother to her child during pregnancy. According to experts, there is also a low risk that individuals who work in occupational settings where they are exposed to blood and body excretions, may also become infected. Individuals who test positive for HIV do not automatically contract a full- blown case of what is known as \"clinical\" AIDS. Many never develop any symptoms associated with the AIDS virus, and others develop symptoms associated with AIDS Related Complex ARC).^ 4. s. New York and In October 1987, Randy Shilts, an investigative journalist for the San Francisco Chronicle* revealed that scientist.. suspected a Canadian airline steward of playing a major role in the spread of AIDS to North America The Air Canada erqloyee, Gaetan Dugas, was thought to have contracted the disease in Europe through sexual contacts with Africans. While there is no conclusive evidence that Dugas was actually the first person to introduce the virus to North America, the U.S. federal government apparently believed that during the late 1970s the Canadian steward was the principal actor in the initial spread of the deadly vim among homosexual men. Researchers at the CDC, who refer to Dugas as \"Patient Zero,\" reconstructed the pattern of his sexual activity as he travelled thrmt North \" ARC is th acronym for 'AIDS Related Complex* which encompasses any disease associated with the HTLV-IXI infection tbat does not fall far enough into the specnum to bt-asdinicalAIDS. 124 America, flying from Canada to l+&ew York and San Francb- hgas reprtedly told his War that he averaged 250 sexual partners every year for a decade prior to his death in IW.

Indeed, the New York Commissioner of Health held a press conference at the beginning of the 1985 school year to announce that based on the CDC recommendations, cfiildren with the AIDS M'ru would not autamatically be excluded from public schools, and the identity of such children would remain confidential. In particular, the Health Cammissioner announced &hat a seven year old child who had been reported as having 0s. and had already been attending public school for three years, would be permitted to continue attending that school. This disclosure triggered widespread outrage and fear directive ordering children with AIDS to be admitted to class. The court over-ruled this mandatory directige concluding that local school boards should be given the opportunity to present shswing why students should be barred from contact with other pupils.

Reacting in a manner that has been characterized as an \"epidemic of fear\" and \"plague mentality,\" parenrs of students attending New York schools organized boycotts and protests of the policy.

For example, Dr. James 0.

Despite such attempts at public education, parents of children attending the New York school identified as accommodating an ADS-infected child launched a lawsuit see king to enjoin the admission of the child or, in the alternative, to have the child's identity revealed to school board members and school officials. This petition represented the first legal challenge in North America arising from a school policy on AIDS and school-age children, At the heart of the case, Dismct 27 Communily School Board v. Bod of ~duc&n,~ were the competing rights of the individuals' right to a public education in an unrestricted setting versus the public right to an education in a disease-free environment. After a one month trial which canvassed hth legal and medical issues, the Suprme Court of Queens County upheld the New York policy of nor automatically excluding children infected with the AIDS virus from public schools. In reaching this conclusion, the court ded that this policy did not violate any law relating to communicable or contagious diseases? Moreover, the coun concluded that in view of the medical information testified to during the trial, the policy was neither arbitrary nor capricious, nor an abuse of discretion.\" Indeed, as a result of the ovenuhelming evidence that ADS is not transmissible in a classroom sttin& the court ruled that a policy of excluding all children with AIDS from public school would violate, among other things, a childg constitutional right to equal protection of the laws. While recognizing legitimate parental fears and concerns about the transmissibility of the AIDS virus, the court clearly 130 Mise. 2d 325 (Sup. Cr 1986). 3s Bid- p. 410. Jbid., p. 412 emphasized the paramountcy of individual civil liberties in cases such as this one: Although this court certainly empathizes with the fears and concerns of parents for the health and welfare of their children within the school setting, at the same time it is duty bound to objectively evaluate the issue of automatic exclusion according the evidence gathered and not be influenced by unsubstantiated fears of catastrophe.\" The New York case represented only one of several controversial cases that polarized communities over the issue of whether students with ADS should be permitted to attend publie school.' According to a Gallup Poll taken in the second half of the 198% two- thirds of American adults would permit their children to attend school with a student who had AIDS, while one-fourth would not. Seventeen percent of those who said they would not dow their children to attend classes with AIDS victims said they believed the disease could be transmitted by casual social contact, while 59% of this group said AIDS could not be transmitted in this fashion. Twenty-four percent of the group were undecided? Divergence in American public opinion toward the presence in public school classrooms of persons infected with the ADS virus indicated their sensitivity of the issue, which after all was perceived correctly as a life and death matter, and also illustrated that even in a highly \" In an interesting 1991 post-secondpry AIDS case, the Los Angeles City College decided not to discipline a professor for saying in front of a class of 60 students that he feared he alight contract AlDS if he bded the paper handed in by an HIV positive student.

An additionally interesting facet of the ALDS crisis was the fact that members of the legal community - that is the actors shaping the internal legal culture -- were often more protective and sensitive to victims' rights than the general community (those mprising the external legal culture) who tended to be more likely to come face-to- face with problems of AIDS infection. Unlike the field of special education where members of the general community could be generally sympathetic to the needs of the disabled without fearing that the requirements of that constituency would impact on their own health status, the issue of AIDS aroused much deeper anxieties within the general population. One example of the public hysteria exhibited in parents opposed to public schooling for AIDS victims, centred around the Ray family of Arcadia, Florida The three young Ray boys contracted the AIDS virus while bekg treated for haemophilia. After the disdosure that dl three bays had tested positive for the AlDS virus, a wave of hysteria swept the small Southern community: the local barber refused to cut the boys' hair, the family minister suggested the fe not attend loml church services, and even the local mayor withdrew his child fiom the Arcadia elementa~y school. Local parents formed a group called *Citizens Against AIDS in the Schools\" and boycotted the school the Ray boys were attending. Ford out of their elementary school by public pressure and death threats, the Ray family rurned to the courts for a remedy. In 1987, they successfully petitioned a Tampa, Florida district court for an order ailowing the three boys to return to school. In granting the interim order pending a full trial in the case, U.S. District court judge, Elizabeth Kovachevich, specifically addressed the issue of balancing the concerns of the comrnuni ty with those of the Ray family: The Court rempizes the concern and fear which is flowing from this small community, particularly from the parents of school age children in DeSoto County. However, the Court may not be guided by such community fear, parental pressure, and the possibility of lawsuits. \"These obstacles, real as they may be, cannot be allowed to vitiate the righ ts...' of [the Ray children]? Just days after the court order was issued, a fire completely destroyed the Ray home. Court documents setting out the arguments of both the Ray family and the school board disclosed that the schml officials believed that too much was still unknown about AIDS, and that they would not risk exposing children to the disease by admitting the Ray boys. The Ray family accused school officials of \"abusing their power, depriving the boys of their rights because they were disabled, and helping create an atmosphere of hatred towards the boys.41 On September 29, 1988 the Ray family reached a $1.1 million out-of- court settlement with the DeSoto County School District. Judge Kovachevich, in approving the settlement, characterized the award as \"a lesson for educators nationwide. kt us hope * Ray v. Sdrod Dimia of p. 1535. -Fhe court ordered the DeSoto County school board to admit the Ray brothers, but prohibited the boys from taking pan in contact sports. \" Asxiared Rru, September 30.1~. 132 there will not have to be too many more cases for other families or other school boards like the Ray case.42 During the course of their ordeal, the Ray family and their supporters, voiced serious concerns about the inequitable state and locai AIDS policies. Testifytng before the U.S. Senate Hearings Before the Committee on Labour and Human Resources (the Committee charged with tabling the first comprehensive AIDS legislation in the United States), the Rays' lawyer, Mr. William Earl, shed some light on the very different policy approaches adopted by school boards in Florida state, and the consequences of not having any state or national leadership and guidelines: One of the problems.,.is that each county in Florida has an independent elected school board. We have a school board like Arcadia which is, I would say, neandenhd in terms of what we have seen in this case. On tbe other hand, we have other school boards such as Dade County, Florida, and Sarasota County, which after this tragedy adopted a very forward-looking courageous policy of following the CDC guidelines, providing confidentiality. But one of the concerns of the members of that school board was: I am in favour of this policy, this school board member said, but are we going to become a dumping ground for the rest of the state because we have no state leadership and to date no national help on this. And I think that was a very valid concern, the communities' elected officials at the local level who are showing some courage and doing the right thing are rightfully womed that they are going to become magnets for children with this condition from all over the state. So I think we need some state and national help on this.\" An Illinois Superintendent of Schools took this line of thought one step further, arguing that school boards around the US. appeared to be literally *forcingw courts to make policy '' On December 13,1992 Rich Ray, the eldest Ray son, died of an AIDS related illness. He was 15 years old. SL Petersburg Times, &C..~ber 14, 1992, p. 1A * Hm \"AIDS Fedeml Policy Act, 1987,\" United Senate, One Hundredth Congress, September 11, 1W, pp. 16-17. decisions concerning AIDS-infected school age children in order \"to deflect the anger of the comrnuni ty away from school officials.\" In some communities where school officials feel, for whatever reason, that it's politically dangerous to allow the child to enter school, the strategy for dealing with the problem is to force the courts to tell the district that it has to take the child. This, in effect, takes the responsibility off the school official^.^ As school boards ignored, deflected, or confronted AIDS-related policy issues, numerous cases involving school-age children with AIDS arose throughout North America. By the early 1990s such cases were awaiting resolution at either the local school board level or in the courts. It is instructive to briefly consider another student AIDS case in order to illustrate the complexities of the human rights issues that arose in such cases. (6) The Girl in the \"Glass Cqy\" On the eve of the 1988 school year, Judge Elizabeth Kovachevich of the Tampa district court (coincidentally, the same judge who decided the controversial Ray case dixussed above) was called upon to adjudicate yet another difficult student-related AIDS case. In Mminez v. HilLrbaarglr County Schosl ~omd,* a court challenge was brought on behalf of 7-yw-oId Eliana Martinez. Eliana, who was born in Puerto Rico, suffered from Wilmette. Illinois Superintendent Gussner, as cited in Sally Reed, \"Children with AU)$\" Phi Ma bpp, January 1988, p. K8. \" Unreported, August 8,1988 (Tampa Dismct Coun). U4 respiratory distress during the first four months of her life. As put of her treatment she received 39 blood transfusions. At some point during those months, Eliana was scparated from her natural parents and was cared for by a hospital in Puerto Rico, After hearing a radio report about the girl's desperate situation in 1983 Rosa and Joe Martinez of Florida decided to adopt Eliana. Rosa Martineg a licensed nurse, described Eliana\" serious illness during the first years of her life: *When I found her (in 19831 she was a vegetable. She was almost a year old and she weighed only 10 pounds. She wouldn't blink. She wouldn't respond to anyone.* Despite Eliana's health problems, the Martinez family decided to go ahead with the adoptioa In order that Eliana could receive better medid care the family moved to Tampa, Florida. Just two years later, in 1985 the Martinez family was told that 4-year-old Eliana had been infected with the AIDS virus, and was suffering from AIDS- Related Complex (ARC)- EIiana apparently became infected with AIDS as a result of the numerous blood transfusions she received in Puerto Rim. Prior to being diagnosed with AIDS, Eliana attended various private preschools in Tampa Following her diagnosis, she received rehabilitative training from a Tampa agency for approximately six months, Eliana was considered \"trainable mentally handicapped,\" a category designating children with I.Q.'s between 25 and 50. Typically, such children have intellectual abilities corresponding to people onequarter to om-half their ages. Medical experts claimed that Eliana thought and acted like a 3-year-old, although her doctors said that her iatelligena increased with medical treatments (azidothymidine, or AzT),\" and alsa that Eli= is in the top portion of the trainable LQ. range. Eliana spoke ten words, but knew how to sign 54 more using American sign language for the deaf. When Eliana reached school age in the summer of 1W, Mrs- Martinez tried to enroll her daughter in a Hiilsborough County public school for trainable handicapped children. Having already adopted a poky to deal with AfDS-related cases, the school district referred the Martinez request to a special committee of educators and doctors. After cunsidcting Eliads case, the committee turned down her mother's petition to enter the public school system. The Committee did, however, determine that Eh could continue to be home-taught by a homebound teacher provided by the who01 board. At that point, in September 1987, Mrs. Martinez launched a lawsuit challenging the Cormnittee's decision, and requesting a &ciaration that Eliana be permitted to attend public school. After hearing extemive medical evidence, Judge lbvadmhch rendered a judgment in the case on August 8,1988. As in the Ray case (wbere she ruled that the Ray bys could attend school, but could not part in contact sports), Judge Kovacm again attempted to balance the concerns of both the student victim of AiDS aad the community. The judge ruled lhar Eliana could anend Manhattan Exceptional Center, (a public school for disabled children), but that during cbss tbe youngster must stay inside a specially built glass booth. In a highly uaZlSUitl judgment, the judge also specified that tbe enclosure must measure at kast 6x8 feet, be Iocated toward the of the classroom, have a large plexi-glass window and sound system, aod alsa contain a toilet and desk. The ruling further pravided that a special full-time aide would be assign& to Eliana during school hours. The judge's \"glass cagen anangemem was to remain in effect until Eliana was toilet-ttairaad and stopped sucking her fingers? In her written opinion, the judge expressed hope that once Eliana was able to see how her mentally handicapped peers cope, she wouM become toilet-trained ;tnd learn not to habiatally suck her fingers. Once that happened, the judge ruled, \"the remote possibiliv that AIDS could be spread to her classmates would be so slight that Efiana should be allowed to sit in the classroam with her peers. Judge Kovachevich also nhed that other children could play with Eliana, but only if their parents first signed consent forass. Although Eliana's mother said she did not intend to send her daughter to school under such arrangements, school officials commissioned construction of a $10,000 glass endosure complete with plumbing, and also having dimensions larger (10x19 feet) than those mandated by the coun* Not surprisingly, Kovactrevich's judicial balancing act satisfied neither Eliana's mot her nor the school board.50 Extremely unbap~ with the \"glass cagew compromise, Eliana's mother appealed the case, explaining that Eliana \"was deprived of family and we became that. She was deprived of health and we gave her the best medical attention we could, Most ban&+ trainable children must be toilet trained aher they enter school. * (Mrmdo Scntincl, August 25, explaiaed the -8s reasons for complying witb the court order to cunmuct the glass both: \"What the judge is asking us to do is unusual. But we're going to do it. I'm not c;ritickiqg I'm not praising.

She needs more than an hour a week to prqyes. And she needs friends.\"' .Mrs. Martinez believed that Eliana should either be allowed to attend school under normal conditions, or remain in the homebound program. Hillsborough County school officials, who feared Eliana might transmit the AlDS virus through bodily fluids, wanted ta bar her from attending school, but were also opposed to the glass booth remedy. One school board member, for example, said the booth was \"sadistic,\" aund tbat \"if we did that in any other school in Hillsborough County we would be before the court for child abuse.\" Hillsborough Superintendent Raymond Shelton said that \"his heart goes out to the judge. I don't see an end solution of this problem of children with AIDS and handicaps. But I haven't heard anyone with an education background that thinks this will be a positive experience for her- I just don't think this is any kind of instructional solution .... I think it could be harmful emotionally.\" Parents of Eliaoa's prospective classmates were also unhappy with the court ruling. Days before the first week of school, 150 parents toured the newly constructed glass booth. Following the inspection, one parent remarked: \"If Eliana Martinez comes here, my daughter won%.* Another pent commented: Tm sorry she [EIiaaa] has the disease, but why put all the other children in jeopardy?-53 Shonly following the cowt order, Elids lawyer filed for a stay of the district court order, and for an appeal before the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlatlta.

What are the implications of nor having such pdW in place? What ckmcnts and inrerests shauld a dmd board policy AIDS AIDS and WWairrd% At the beginning of the 1985 school year, New York Schools Chancellor, Nathan Quinones, disclosed that at least eight New York Board of Education employees had been diagnosed as having MDS. We also reported that docton at the school board, in mrrsultation with the Health Department, would be evaluating all the MDS-infected employees who were seeking to return to work. In a move consistent with the CDC's medicd findings, the Schools Chancellor announced that because the danger of contagion wiu \"e~remely remote,* teachers with AIDS would be permitted to function in the classroom setting, stating that if the teacher could \"perform that job, and there are no other medical reasons Wring his or her returo, then that person will be permitted to return to work: The identities of the teachers were considered ~nfidential.~ Just one month later, tbe US. National Education Association (NEA) reteased c~mtp~eherrrive &uidehcs similar to the New York policy, designed to provide schools with poky-- guidawr rtkvaat to teachers (and students) who had contracted the AIDS vim. The guide lines^' which were modelled after the CDC's position regarding students and AIDS, attempted to strike a balance between the right of a school board employee who has AIDS to continued employment and the right of students and other school employees to be free from the risk of exposure to the disease. The National Education Association (NEA) policy provides guidelines in two different areas: (1) protection of the rights of teachers who have AIDS and; (2) protection of the rights of uninfected teachers vis-a-vis other teachers and students infected with the AIDS virus. One of the most controversial aspects of the debate regarding teachers with AIDS concerns whether school boards have the right to require teachers to submit to an AIDS test; and, if bards do have such a right, what criteria should be utilized to determine when such testing should take place. The NEA guidelines stipulate that school boards should request medical evaluations or@ when the board has \"reasonable cause\" to believe an employee have contracted AIDS. \"Reasonable cause\" is deemed to exist in only a very narrow range of circumstances, i.e., if the spouse of a school employee has AIDS, or if a school employee has given birth to a child who has AIDS. The guidelines also specifically state that sexual orientation does not constitute reasonable cause for the purpose of testing, and that school employees cannot be compdled to disclose information concerning their d orientatioaS The NEA gw'deliaes suggest that tne determination of whether or not an infected National Education Association, \"Recommended Guidelines for Dealing with AIDS in ttSt SchooW October 9,1985 * lW, \u0081ectiom 2 (a), (b). school employee should be permitted to remain employed in a capacity that involves contact with students or other school employees, should be made on a case-by-case basis. Such decisions are to be made by a specially designated team composed of public health personnel, the school employee's physician, the school employee and/or his representative, and appropriate school personnel. In making their determination, the team must consider the physical condition of the schml employee, the expected type of interaction with others in the school setting, and the impact on both the infected school employee and others in that setting? Perhaps the most controversial civil liberty issue to be raised by the AIDS epidemic is the question of confidentiality. What are a teachers' privacy rights? What are the rights of students and other school employees to be informed that they might be in contact with an infected individual? In keeping with its objective of balancing individual and collective rights, the NEA suggests that the identity of an infected individual, or an individual who there is reasonable cause to believe has been infected by the AIDS virus, shall not be publicly revealed. With regard to teachers permitted to remain in the school setting, however, the NEA guidelines provide that school employees who are likely to have regular personal contact with the AIDS-infected teacher should be informed of &/her identity by the school board, and provided with appropriate information as to tbat individual's medical If the team assessing a teacher makes a determination that the infected teacher \" Bid, section 1 (c). Ibid, section 5. should be terminated, or if the teacher arrives at this decision together with the school board, the NEA AIDS policy provides that such individuals are entitled to use any available medical leave and receive any available medical disability benefits. The guidelines also recommend that school boards review their state retirement systems and other disability income programs and, if necessary, seek to amend them to provide appropriate coverage for school employees with AIDS!' How to protect the civil rights of non-infected teachers is an issue which tended to be overlooked in the scramble to formulate policies for dealing with AIDS victims. Most jurisdictions in North America have occupational health and safety legislation which provide that employers must provide employees with safe working environment. The AIDS crisis ha routinely confronted school boards with the complex issue of how to ensure non-infected teachers a safe working environment. In New York City, for example, where wer 200 people a month die of AIDS and health officials estimate that there are thousands of infected children in the school system, the Board of Education attempted to deal with this difficult problem by announcing in late 1987 that 15 million drsposable gloves at a cost of $50,000 would be distributed to teachen in the City's 100 public school^.^ The NEA guidelines suggest that non-infected teachers should not be required to teach or provide other personal contact se~ces to an infected student, or to work with an infected school \" New York Depanment of Healtb, 1987. Tbe poliey was endorsed by the United ~eachers Eederation. Ln Canada, it was reported in 1988 that a Winnipeg school board ordcrcd 2,000 pairs of Eatex gloves to protect teachers from children who might carry the AIDS virus Mew Mikiforuk, \"AIDS: Haw Sex, Death and Fear Spell Profitis and Losses, Cm BrrrineJs, May 1988, p. 108. employee, unless an infected individual has been screened and permitted to remain in the school setting. Moreover, the guidelines offer that the NEA and its affiliates will provide appropriate legal assistance to any teacher who is disciplined by a school employer because he/she refuses to teach, provide personal contact services to, or work with an infected individual in the absence of a team a~sessrnent.6~ (b) Teachers and AIDS= Schd Superintendents' Perspectives Despite the formulation of national guidelines concerning AIDS and teachers, a 1987 study examining the attitudes and perceptions of 100 local school board superintendents, revealed that views concerning AIDS policies varied significantly am the United States.\" For example, Superintendents were almost equally divided (56% to 44%) concerning whether teachers with AIDS should be afforded the protection of federal antidiscrimination laws which currently protect individuals against discrimination based on race and age, and whether school district policies should treat AIDS differently from other communicable diseases (58% to 427~). Differing views were also revealed in response to questions about teacher 00ntr~cts and AIDS. For example, 78% of the respondents opposed and 22% 1% section 4. \" The study was based on a 57-item questionnaire sent to 100 Superintendents out of 500 individuals identified as outs^^ by the Executive Educator, a publication of the National School Board Associatioa The authors received a 96% response rate.

There was more consensus, however, with regard to questions concerning mandatory testing, with 93% of the respondents opposing the mandatory testing of teachers; 84% opposing the mandatory testing of support staff, and 95% opposing the testing of school volunteers. No matter how school boards and superintendents decide how to deal with the many controversial issues inherent in any ADS policy, they are likely to be influenced by many factors including la citizen pressure, political exigencies, and other local dynamics. (c) The Racine Case Tbe trend toward litigation of policies concerning teachers and AlDS had already begun in 1985 in Racine, Wisconsin, when the Superintendent of Schools observed that it was \"easy to identify\" individuals who were infected with the AIDS virus \"because all AIDS victims look like Rock Hudson,\" and a school board member suggested that \"homosexuals should not teach Rack Unified School District children.\" Shortly following these obseivations, the Racine school board put in place an AIDS policy for dealing with AIDS- infected teachers and students. The policy, adopted in 1985, provided that teachers and staff members ahiiting any \"AIDS symptoms\" - identified by the policy as including mere paleness or weight Ioss - would be required to submit to a compulsory deal examination for the disease. The Racine policy deviated from the National Education Association's guidelines on AIDS both with respect to the criteria for testing (i.e., the NEA guidelines stipulate that there must be \"reasonable cause\" before testing ofcurs), and the right of teachers suffering from the disease to either continue working in the school setting or resign with fuH medical benefits. According to the Racine policy, school employees diagnosed as having AIDS were to be e:,pelled from the school setting, barred from their employment, and placed on sick leave. When the sick leave period expired, the Racine policy provided that employees would be immediately terminated without any further disability benefits. The school board's AIDS policy was challenged by the Racine Educational Asmiation (REA) during 1986 in a legal action heard by an administrative law judge in the Wisconsin Department of Industry, Labour and Human Relations Department (DILHR).~ The REA's lawyer argued that teachers with AIDS are \"handicapped\" and are therefore protected by federal antidiscrimination legislation. In making his argument, the REA's lawyer relied on the 1987 landmark ruling of the United States Supreme Court in School Baanl of N4~smr v. ~riine~' In that decision, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a Florida . .. elementary school teacher had been cfiscnrmnated against when she had been suspended with pay and later fired because she had active tuberculosis. The court held that tuberculosis was a communicable disease which qualified the teacher as \"handicapped\" and therefore guaranteed her protection under federal civil rights law. In reaching this 66?kh?~-- . . v. Racine Unified School Lktrkt, Unreported, Case No. 8650279, Wisconsin Department of Indusny, Labour and Human Relations, October 9,1987. conclusion, the Supreme Court discussed the rationale for treating communicable diseases as a fundamental civil rights issue: Congress acknowledged that society's accumulated myths and fears about disability and disease are as handicapping as are the physical limitations that flow from actual impairment. Few aspects of a handicap give rise to the same level of public fear and misapprehension as contagiousness. Even those who suffer or have recovered from such noninfectious diseases such as epilepsy or cancer have faced discrimination based on the irrational fear that they might be contagious. The [Rehabilitation Act of 19731 is carefully structured to replace such reflexive reactions to actual or perceived handicaps with actions based on reasoned and medically sound judgments.' Although the Supreme Court expressly sidestepped the issue of determining whether the 1973 Rehabilitation Act protects carriers of the AIDS virus, the REA argued that the reasoning of the Supreme Court opinion offered a measure of protection to people suffering impairment from any disease, including AIDS, from being dismissed by employers or excluded fiom schools because of irrational fears of contagion or infection. After two years of litigation, the REA finally succeeded in securing a court order which both overturned the AIDS policy, and directed the school board to pay a major portion of the Association's legal fees. Judge Pamela Rasche reasoned that the school board policy was \"intended to be an absolute ban on the attendance of persons with AIDS- ARC in the Racine Unified Schools,\" and therefore discriminated against teachers following the tests laid down by the US Supreme Court in Arline. She also wrote that the ' IbLi, p. 1129. The ase imrohred section 504 of the RehabilitMion Act of 1973.29 USC $794, which bars rezipients of Federal financial assistance (in this case a Nassau public xhd) from discriminating against \"haxidie people who are \"otherwise qualified\" to dothejoborjxwticipateintheprogramatIssue. Superintendent's \"intention was clear. He found no need to make a case-by-case evaluation because he did not want any persons with AIDS-ARC in the schoois under any circumstances.\"@ (d) The fincent Chalk Caw Another example of a school board policy that actually resulted in one of the first cases of litigation involving a teacher with AIDS, was the landmark California case of Chalk and the Otange County Depmnnent of h&n. The case unfolded after Vincent Chalk, a 43year old teacher of hearing impaired students, disclosed to the Orange County school board that he had contramd AIDS. In August 1987 the school board barred Chalk from his teaching duties despite the fact that a county public health officer had determined that the teacher posed no health threat to his stud en^.^ In lieu of his teaching duties, rhe board proposed that Chalk sit out the school year and work in an office writing grant proposals. The teacher turned down the school board's proposal, as in the words of his lawyer: \"Sending him home would be like being declared useless to the Eskimo band and being set adrift on an iceberg. ... He's a real human being and he wants to feel a Oa May 22, lW, Dr. Thomas J. Rendergast, the Director of Epidemiology and Disessc: Control for the Orange County Health Care Agency, informed the Orange County bdon Department that \"mthing in [CbaWs] role as a teacher should place his students or others in the s;chooI at any risk of acquiring the HIV infection.\" Cited in Chalk v. US. &i C., 832 F2d 2365 (9th Cir. 1987), p. 2370. meaningful.\"71 Defending tbe board's decision. the Orange County Superintendent of Schools suggested that the board's priority was the public health of the school's students: \"Our concern is to be as compassionate as possibIe for AIDS victims, yet our first priority has got to be the welfare of the students and others who might come in contact with him [~halk].~ When Chalk and the school bard could not reach an agreement on his status for the 3987-88 school year, they turned to the courts to resolve the issue. In fact, school officials indicated that they preferred having the courts make the final determination regarding Chalks' employment status. As the County Superintendent noted, if the school board were required by a court order to return Chalk to his classroom duties, the board would be protected from possible lawsuits from students and their parents. For example, he suggested that \"if someone [in the school] came down with AIDS, from some unknown cause, they could immediately consider some kind of court action against us.an In August 1987, the Orange County school board petitioned the Orange County Superior Court for a ruling on whether Mr. Chalk had the right to teach in the classroom, and Chalk countersued in a Los Angeles federal court, requesting a preliminary injunction blocking his transfer to a non- teaching position. Ia September, U.S. District Judge William Gray turned down Chalk's injunction Educmion Week, September 9, 1987, p. 7. =16id. \" hid. application.\" Although attorneys filed over 100 articles from medical journals reporting studies that concluded that AIDS cannot be trumitted through casual contact, Judge Gray ruled that there was still too little known about the deadly disease to allow the teachers' return to the classroom.^ In denying Chalk's injunction, the District eoun concluded that Chalk's \"injuryw was outweighed by the fear that his presence in tfie classroom was likely to produce: I think I have a right - in fact, an obligation to compare on the one hand the trauma on the plaintiff [Chalk] if he is held out from the school for a period of months .... The trauma on him, on the one hand, with the trauma on the children and parents in bein required to submit to what they are likely to conclude is an unacceptable risk. Jk Chalk appealed the ruling to a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

In making its ruling the court stated that there ww no medical evidence to suggest that the teacher would pose a health risk to his students. Significantly, the court cited the U.S. Supreme Coun decision in Arline as authority in reaching its conclusions abut AIDS, employment and civil rights. In pmisular* the California Appeals Coun pointed to the reasoning and test formulated by the Supreme Court concerning legitimate and illegitimate grounds for excluding a person with a communicable disease from tmployment: The Supreme Ccwt recognized in Adhe that a significant risk of transmission was a legitimate concern which could justij. exclusion if the risk could not be eliminated through reasonable accommodation; however, it somdy rejected the argument that exclusion could be justified on the basis of 'pernicious mythologies* or \"irrational fear.\"78 Employing this reasoning, the California appeals court thus condudad that *even under the balance of hardships standad [Chalk's] injury outweighs any harm to the [Orange: County school bud].-- Commenting on the COUrtts decision, oae of Ws lawyen, remarked (propbetically, as it would later turn out) that the decision would have \"a trcmeadous impact throughout the country, became the ccwn bas said very clearly, given what we know about AfDS, it is improper to exdude or disaimiaote to Change County explained it: 1Ak hawe tried ro be as compassioina~e as we could be....

As the number of adult AIDS victims soared in Canada. the question of how to deal with employment-related AIDS issues received heightened legal and policy attention. In April 1987, the first errrploymenr-related case concerning AIDS and the workplace in CaOStda wa9 arbitrated. In the case of Re Pacific Western Airlines Ltd. v.

The policy prohibited mandatory AIDS testing for federal employees, discrimination against people considered especially vulnerable to AIDS infection, or against those who associate with victims of the disease. The new policy also prohibited employers from refusing to hue an AIDS victim simply because fellow workers refused to work with the individual. Max Yalden, the Chief Commissioner of the Federal Human Rights Commission, indicated that the policy guidelines had been introduced \"to cut down the element of panic and make people realize this is not something you catch by walking down the street with someone or working with someone in the officr.& On June 28, 1988, the first AIDS case to be determined under human rights legislation was settled by a nurse with AIDS his Toronto hospital employer. The nurse, Ron kntz, had filed a complaint with the Ontario Human Rights Commission alleging that he had been dismissed by the hospitaI after they learned he had AIDS. The settlement, which was approved by the Ontario Human Rights Commission, included Mr. Lentz's reinstatement, approximately $14,000 in benefits, $5,000 for legal fees, restoration of seniority, and a clean employment record- Commenting on the Commission's consent order, Raj Anand Chief Commissioner of the Ontario Human Rights Commission, observed that: *ow central principle is that penom with AIDS or AIDS-related conditions must be clearly Vrnmna Sim, Mpy 24 1988, p.

Moreover, Anand observed that: \"This case should send a strong signal to the public and to persons with AIDS that they have the right not to be discriminated against in the workp~ace.~ (6) The Bi&s/Cole Care On October 14, 1988, the B.C. Human Rights Council rendered its first decision in an AIDS-related d~minatioa case. Ruling on a complaint by Peter Biggs -- a Vancouver apartment dweller who claimed that he and his roommate had been evicted from their West End apartment because Bigs had AIDS Related Complex (ARC) -- the Council stated that individuals infected with AIDS have a \"physical disability\" and are therefore entitled to protection under the B.C. Human &$us Act. That statute prohibits discrimination on the his of disability. In reaching this conctusion, the Human Rights Council employed reasoning very dmiku to tbat of U.S. courts and tribunals who had adjudicated AIDS dixriminath cases, and in particular, adopted the conclusions reached by the US. Supreme Cwrt in the Adhe dedsioa The Human Rights Council also considered and adopted the -- -- \" Letter to Editor, Ghk d Md, July 6, 1988. p.

In effect the Biggs/Cole decision -- like the PWA and Len cases -- meant that AIDS victims were legally entitled to equal treatment with respect to public facilities, emptoyment, etc. Ironically, however, the Council dismissed the claim brought by Peter Biggs and his roommate, Joseph Cole, concluding that because Biggs had persisted in keeping a pet dog in an apartment building with a \"no pet policy,\" the apartment laudlord had a bona fide reason for evicting the two men from their apartment. (c) The Canadian Teachers' Fedemtion AIDS Policy During the 1980s and early 1990s, school board employees and students in Canada were not widely infected with the AIDS virus when compared with the situation in the U~ted States. Canadian school administrators were consequently not under the same policy or legal pressure to deal witb situations that might arise in the school setting. Concerned that the American experience foreshadowed similar difficulties in the Canadian public education system, Canadian school boards, teachers' associationq and parents, nevertheless, expressed strong concern about students, school board employees and the AIDS crisis. Mandatory testing, confidentiality, removal from employment responsibilities, and the pmvkian of senriocrs to studtny were among the issues cikmsd at both the local and nafSOCltL] Iewk ia chada. In order to provide some guidance to these various groups, the Canadian Tern' Federabn (CI'F) adopted the first education-related national policy concerning teachers, students and the AIDS crisis at their 1987 Annual General Meetingw The CTF policy preamble began by stating that medical evidence had demonstrated that the ADS virus was transmissible only through sexual activity, sharing contaminated needles, as the result of contamination of transfusion of blood or blood product, or by a mother infecting her child at the time of birth. Witb respect to teachers infected with the AIDS virus, the CTF policy statement was similar to the US. National Education Association guidelines, providing that: (1) the identity of a teacher with AIDS should be protected; (2) teachers infected with AIDS should have the right to continue their employment, and; (3) where a teacher with an AIDS-related illness becomes too sick to work, full access to sick leave, long-term disability and medical benefits should be ensured. d The Eric Smirh Care Ouring the summer of 1987 Eric Smith, at approximately the same time that the (3\u0081F was drafting its national AIDS policy, a 29-year old teacher in the Cape Sable Island community of Clark's Harbour, Nova Scotia, checked into a local bospitaj for routine surgery- U- to Smith, his doctor ordered among other tests, a blood test for the presence of Wn/, Several days Eater, Smith3 doctor phoned him with news that would fundamentally change the life of the Nova Scotia teacher: his test results revealed that he had AIDS. What might have remained a private matter between Smith, his doctor, and the school board, erupted overnight into a heated public controversy when a medical secretary with access to Mr. Smith's medical files disclosed to her sister that an \"unnamed teacher\" at the xhooI her sister's daughter was attending had contracted AIDS. Prior to this disclosure, Eric Smith had fed a quiet and seerningfy model life in the small Sable Island community. He was reportedly a dedicated and committed teacher, admired and respected by students, parents and deagues at Cape Sable Island elementary school. The teacher had kept his private life, and in particular his homosexuality, completely confidential, not even disclosing his sexual orientation to his family. Within &ys of learning that he had AIDS, Smith's private life became a matter of public record and debate. Amidst the rumours, speculation, and fear that gripped the small Baptist community, Smith reported his newly diagmsed medicaI condition to the Shelburne County school bud. As many other scbool boards in Canada, the Shelburne County scbl board had not drafted an employee or student AIDS policy, nor had even discussed alternative policy responses to a potcntiatl AIDS case. Under intense public pressure and threats from parents that they would pull their children dram aH fourteen schools in Shelburne County if Smith were albwcd to oontirrue ttachiqIb the dm01 baud decided to relieve the teacher from his teaching rcspmiih and to reassign bim to a non-teaching position.

Another Nova Scotia doctor noted that it was ironic that a school board, rather than educating the public, was fuelling public hysteria: \"To me it is outrageous that a board of education is supporting ignorance.\"' A spokesman for the provincial Health Department suggested that even a person who displays symptoms of AIDS presents no risk in the casual contact of the classroom if he or she is at the first stages of the disease.% The parent group clamouring for the teacher's removal was as much concerned with the \"infectiousness\" of Smith's homosexuality, as with the possibility of the transmission of the AlDS virus, For example, in an effort to educate themselves about the disease, the staunchly religious Protestant community turned to audio tapes prepared by Christian fundamentalist groups in the US. which cautioned parents that homosexual teachers were attempting to indoctrinate students into \"unnatural practices.\" The spectre of immoral practices king propagated by homosexual teachers led one community Baptist minister to suggest in public hearings that was needed to \"conquer the bystanders.\" Altbough Eric a return to \"biblical moralityR not AIDS education was what disease.\" He added that homosexuals are not \"innocent Smith decided not to legally challenge the school board GIObc mad Moil, September 2,1987, p.

For a decision, he was extremely unhappy with the board's decision to remove him from his teaching duties, Not long after the school board decision, the Nova Scotia government hastily convened an AIDS task force in October 1987 with a mandate to study and make recommendations concerning how to deal with the AIDS epidemic. Smith was one of the members appointed to the provincial task force. Just days following the creation of the Nova Scotia task force, Premier John Buchanan, commenting on the Smith case, observed that parents have a right to be told if their children's teacher bas AIDS. Taking a position contrary to the provincia! health regulations -- which require medical confidentiality unless a person with an infectious disease is a threat to public health -- Premier Buchanan stated: \"My own personal view is that a parent has a right to know if a teacher has the AIDS disease.\" Although the Premier acknowledged the distinction between an individual who actually had AIDS, and one who is simply a carrier of the AIDS virus, he suggested that parents in Cape Sable Island were not interested in such distinctions when it came to the public safety of their children. Citing ttrc recent AIDS-related death of a PEI teacher in support his pition that the names of teachers with AIDS should have their names revealed, the Premier commented: 'We had an unfortunate situation in PEI where a teacher wasn't a carrier but actually had the disease and did It created a real furore over there and it was decided that the parents had a right to know, as did ohr teachers have the right to know.* hchanan's remarks were btcrosder disarssioa of the reiigious right and North American public education see Chapter 6oftbedisxrtation. Y Be#y Mhher of Education for PEI denied that any SUCh decision had been nrade. Ncw BNmwidr's Ministry of Education revealed its policy in September 1987, attacked by members of the medical community and others. One AIDS specialist, for example, characterized the premier's comments as \"typical of the low level of knowledgeability existing in the province.\"% As of March, 1988 Nova Scotia had 29 recorded AIDS cases and 12 AIDS related deaths? Premier Buchanan reversed his position within days of his initial comments, and later stated that the identities of teachers with AIDS should be made public only with an individual's permission: \"If the teacher doesn't want to divulge the information, that's entirely up to the individual, not up to the G~vernment.'~ Interestingly, in a Gallup poll which asked Canadians to respond to the question: \"Do you agree or disagree that people with special responsibility for Canada, like politicians or teachers should be medically tested to find out whether or not they have exposed to AIDS?\" 6394~ of the people polled in Atlantic Canada agreed with a this statement. This result was 9% above the national average of 5496, and the highest positive response rate to this question in the country.* In response to the question: \"Do yes agree or disagree that employers test everyone they employ?\" Canadians in Atlantic Canada again had the highest level of agreement with the question at 57% compared with a national average of 46%. Nova Scotia has reported the highest incidence of AIDS cases in Atlantic Canada, which included a strong section on the need for maintaining confidentiality of teachers' medical records.

Once again, as in the earlier discussion of American responses to the AIDS crisis, members of the broader Canadian community indicated that they were very sensitive to the health risks of the epidemic, and willing to curtail individual rights in order to minimize that risk. The Nova Scotia AIDS task force conducted public hearings during 1987 and 1988. In an attempt to influence the task force report, Shelburne County town councils passed resolutions advocating that people exposed to the AIDS virus be barred from Nova Scotia classrooms. One town council went so far as to resolve that all homosexuals be barred from entry into public school classrooms. These resolutions ze not binding on school board policy- As the heated public debate over teachers and AIDS continued, the Shelburne County school board decided to allow Eric Smith to return to teaching in the fall of 1988 despite threats from parents that they would keep their children home from school. One parent cautioned, for example: \"If the board tells us ... he's been assigned to our school, fine our kids won't be there the first day of September. They won't be there the 20th day of September for the school board to get their funding neither.& 99ngton Municipal Cormcil, a Shelburne County township, indicated to the Shelburne County school board that it is \"not in favour of known carriers of tbe AIDS virus, whether they be tachen, students or others, being place in the school system.\" In the wake of harsh criticism and ultimatums, the Shelburne County school board has expressed its \"exasperation\" in attempting to formulate and implement a policy to accommodate both parents and Smith. For example, in a written brief to the Nwa Scotia task force the school board plaintively queried: \"Can we, as a board, compel students to attend a class where parents perceive the teacher to be a danger and immoral?\" Eric Smith did not return to his teaching position with the Shelburne County school board. When the task force he had been appointed to rzleased its report in October 1988 the teacher condemned the report, characterizing the project \"as a waste of a whole year,\" and suggesting that the report's recommendations did not adequately address the issue of human rights protections for individuals infected with the AIDS virus.lm (e) The Centre d Xcceuil Care ln 1989, one of the few AIDS-related cases in the Canadian public education system was arbitrated in the province of Quebec. In Ceme d'Accueil Sainte-Domiti& v. Union des Employees de Service, Local 298,'\" Louise Lamothe, a special education teacher who had contracted AIDS, was terminated from her teaching duties with the Centre d'Accueil Sainte DornitiUe for refusing to submit to her employer's request that she be tested for the HIV virus. The teacfrer grieved her termination, arguing that the Centre d'Acceuil had infrrnged her rights by mnding that sbe submit to a medical examination as a condition for returning to her employment. The Centre d'Acceuil was a boarding school for behaviourally difficult teenage girls. where the teaching staff Jive with the students. Lamothe had been on sick leave from the Centre from October 1987 as a result of cljntracting malaria, and was sched~led to return to her teaching duties on March 1, 1988. On February 26, 1988, the teacher participated in a television program in disguise, during which she revealed that she was infected with the HIV virus. As it turned out, one of the Centre's directors was watching the program, and despite her disguise, recognized Lamothe. The director subsequently contacted the teacher and indicated that she would have to submit to a medical examination before she would be able to return to work Despite her objection to tbe demand, Lamothe did attend a medical examination, and was found to be in good health and capable of returning to work. However, she did not disclose to the doctor that she was infected with the AIDS virw, and the doctor's final report did not indicate that she was HW positive. Despite the results of the medical eltamination, the Centre d\"Aaui1 made a request that Lamothe undergo a second examination. The teacher refused tor submit to this second examination, and consequently she he terminated from her employwntim Ia ttde teacher's gpicvanae* Lamotbe's ernpdoyment at ohc Centre which provided that employees who were utcused from tbeu duties as a rtsult of avrying infections were to be tranaferrcd to mthcr position arbitrator concluded that the employer had no basis for demanding the medical ex;unination, nor for terminating tbe teachefs ernpla_vment, and that there w.as no medical basis for the enqdayerk fears in this regard- The arbitrator also remarked that the directors of the Centre had sufficient information or sufficient access to such irlformation that they should nor have based their decrision to terminate the teacher based on their own preconceptions of\" the disease. Of parti& significance in this regard, according to the arbitrator, was the fm that the- employer had sought Iegd advice during the case which had indicated that the emplayer did not have legal grounds to take terminate the teacher. Interestingly, the arbisator did not condude that Lamothe had acted improperly in refusing the doctor aecws ta kr complete medical fib.

Commenting on the general orientation cllf these AIDS policies at tbe July 1988 CIF cornrention, tk President of the Ontario Federation (OW) observed that: \"Zbt basic intent of thc rights of both students ud teachers as a bdc phiiompbical belief has been accepted across rbe mnuy.'lw The OTF President was quick to point out that the pblk hysteria sumnrnding the Eric Smith RBa sct, Foam* A Policy - ~ocid ~civnr and -, vot 30, NO. 2 Q~W), p. zi~rn. different provinces. For example, in Manitoba, the Manitoba Education Council released guidelines in September 1988 which, according to Manitoba Education Minister LRn Derkatch, were sent to school superintendents around the province in order \"to help divisions create rheir own policies to deal with AIDs.\"'~ The Ministries of Education in British Columbia and New Brunswick also issued policy statements concerning AIDS-related school issues. In other pravinca AIDS policies have originated at the local level. For example, the Vancouver and Langley school boards in British Columbia aad the Ottawa Board of Education, Carleton Separate School Board, and Waterloo Region Separate School Board in Ontario have a11 developed their own Id AIDS policies, whicb drew upon a combination of provirlcial health lam, the Canadian Teachers\" Federation guidelines, and the Center for Disease Control recommendations. All thtse policies contained stringent provisions to ensure that tbe identity of an AIDS-infected individual remains confidential. According to the Waterloo Region Separate School superintendent, Tony Tnrsccllo, in the As illustrated by tbe above judicial and policy trends, members of the legal and education communiQ appeared highly advanced in their sensitivity to the rights-related b facet! of the AIDS crisis, and the need for balancing protections accorded to individuals with the AIDS virus, aad the broader Canadian community. Tbis heightened sensitivity on the part of the legal and education communities may be due to the fact that the growth of the AIDS epidemic coincided with the emergence of Canada's new Chapter of R&@ and Fmmbms. This situation likely enhanced tbe legal community\"~ awareness af the special righerelated issues surrounding this particular health crisis. V, BALANCE-MAINTENANCE IN A POLICY CRISES community, Unlike \"cfassic\" policy paradigms which prevail during periods of \"normal\" or routine decision-making, crises engender a telescoped or compressed pliey-makiag pattern ia which the \"ardculadon\" \"aggregatior2\" and \"dlocationw of policies occur almost ~imultaneously.'~ It is only afrer a ealmer atmosphere prevails, and more expertise and information are brought to bear on the crisis at hand, that greater attention is devoted to Mng the interests of the community with those of the victims and carriers of a rapidly spreading disease. Thrus, epidemics such as the AID5 crisis appear to go through several waves of decision-making, and it is not until the initiai anxieties generated by tbe health risks have been dampened that deliberate consideration cn be given to formulating appropriate policies and carefulk working aut a balanced and Iegdy sound response which recognizes the rights of both the braider itamunity and thost dire suffering from the epidemic* The impact of the MIX cnjis on No& American public education detailed in this chapter iEhrstrates many of the diffiilti~~ of policy-making during a medical &is. As Sandra Panem pointed out in a recent study of policy-makirrg aDd the AIDS epidemic \"a between executive and congressionail branches of the federal government, makes rivalria among different agenci es.... lack of clear cut lines of authority and aemntability amow officials in different levels of government, and informal relations between the public and private sector - is part of the problem Although on a day-to-day basis sucb practices may foster creative tension and provide checks and bafances, they come into conflict with the successful handling of a novel health emergency.'* Another study critical of policy management during the AID5 epidemic has charged that by the time America \"paid attentian to the disease, it was too late to any&@ abut it.\" Tht epidemic \"was afW to bappcn by an array of institutiom all of which failed to perform their appropriate tasks to safeguard the public Beyond the disruptioo of *normalR policy-making paradigms, the management and mismanagement of the AIDS epidemic also illustrate how questions of justice and equity soon intrude on the oonsciousatss of victims and spectators during the plague-like crises of maQern dcmaerades. These Itgal repercussions were recqgnked by a 1986 Canadian Bar hsuciation report identifying the risk to fadiviw civil liberties poscd by tbe modern AIDS At stake are the kgitimnte interests of individuals h controlhg the generation and clkscminadon of irbormation about them (privacy), the individuals interest in carrying on with the nod activities of one's life unlimited by unwarranted restraints based upon one's medical condition (liberty). and the right not to be discriminated against with regard to employment. accommodation and such matters, because of an unjustified perception that tbe individuals poses a signrficant risk to others (non- disctimination).'* Tbe same report also stressed that: It is impossible to insist on the a priori primacy of one set of interests over the other: both are legitimate aod important, and must be accommodated to the extent possible in every decisiori to be made. For example, even if one thought that the protection of public health ought to predominate in the balance, one would still have to take account of the constrain& both legislative and constitutional, that operate in this context-\"* Although the AIDS crisis did not abate, by the mid-1990s policy-makers and the public seemed relatively better informed, and also better able to deal with the consequences of the epidemic. Certainly fear and ignorance about AIDS did not drsappear, nor did a dear cornensus emerge about the causes, treatment, or proper policy response to the disease. Chidelines for a more rational policy paradigm were, however, more readily awdable to those seeking such advice, and the public appeared far more aware of what behaviaur is appropriate in ddhg with the demands of a serious, but still controllable health emergency. M, CHAPTER StjMMARY AND IMPLICATIONS FOR LEGAL CULTUKE Canada's constitutional development in the decade after 1982 closely paralleled global and national awareness about the AIDS epidemic. During the crucial years prior to 1982, when debate ensued regarding a \"made-in-Canadan constitution and the adoption of a charter of rights, an organized constituency mobilized to educate and seek assistance for the victims of AIDS still had not fully appeared on the Canadian political stage. However, in the decade after 1982, the response to the AIDS crisis on the part of Canadian citizens and government officials was significantly affected by Canada's new constitutional dynamics and burgeoning rights consciousness - a pattern with broad similarities to the emergence of Canada's special needs constituencies discussed in Chapter 3. As pointed out in the dissertation's earlier theoretical discussion (Chapter I), significant changes in citizen feelings and expectations about \"rights,\" that is, those privileges and liberties which are genedly considered antecedent to government and institutionalized legal declarations, and to which political decisionmakers and participants in the legal process must accommodate themselves, may signal an important alteration in the legal culture.''\" Thc *is in this chapter revealed cbanged expectations about the \"right* of Cdian teachen infected with the AIDS virus to continue teaching in the Camdbn public '* For a bmsder clhmsbn of this concept Ronald R@b hims& (Cambridge, MPn:. Haward University Press, 19n). school system, and also new responses by the legal system, in particular human rights c0-11ci1s and arbitrators, in processing and upholding such claims. The assertion and recognition of such claims or rights both contributed to and reflected a significant change in Canadian rights consciousness and legal culture. The evidence for this change is largely inferential and cannot be considered definitive proof of a cause and effect relationship, but it is arguable, based on the evidence presented, that an important trend is underway. Thus, Canadian teachers with AIDS - foUowing cases succtssfully advanced by teachers and students in the United States - maintained that their illness was a \"disability\" or \"handicap,\" and therefore should not disentitle them from the right to continue teaching in the public school system. However, unlike the special needs c~nstituency discussed in Chapter 3 -- which advanced its agenda of rights and claims largely through Chmter-based litigation and governmental lobbying - AIDS litigants tended to assert their rights through provincial human rights legislation and collective agreement grievance provisions. Several factors account for this trend. In the first place, the constitution's equality provisions did not come into effect until April 17, 1985. Thus, human rights legislation and resort to the arbitration process were initially the only available instruments for advancing employment-related rights in the pre-1985 AIDS cases. Because AIDS litigants were ofttn sucoessful in advancing these claims, human rights legislation and rights arbitration became identified in the early 1980s as the standard legal tool for initiating such rights claims. Secondly, AIDS litigants - - owing to their usually terminal HIV-related illnesses - generaliy did not have the financial resources or tim to lauoeh protracted, complex, and expcmiw Chma castscaStS Thus, litigation launched pursuant to human rights legislation and the arbitration process presented a far more realistic and efficient avenue for AIDS litigants. While employing somewhat different legal vehicles to advance perceived manc'atory rights, the special education and AIDS constituencies (emergent components of a changed external legal culture) contributed to a significant change in the type of demands placed on an adapting legal system (the internal legal culture). Thus, as revealed in the analysis in both Chapters 3 and 4, in tbe demde after 1982 students with physical and mental handicaps and also teachers infected with the AIDS virus perceived that they had mandatory rights that should be legally recognized and accommodated. These two minority groups successfully initiated Iegal and other challenges that prompted the legal system and, indeed the broader Canadian society, to recognize the legitimacy of such claims. As in the discussion of special education in the preceding chapter, the changes in the legal system relating to the AIDS crisis provide a strong inference that the Canadian legal culture is in the throes of an impartant transformation. GENDER EQUITY AND THE CANADIAN PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM: THE IMPACT OF THE CHARTER ON WOMEN'S EQUALlTY RIGHTS You how y ru cannot have a charrer of rights in Canada and not give. ..the women S nghts ...I remember te& some ofthem: Wait until the wOnren..go ajkr you guys, you will come back quick\" Ad that's em& what happened Jean C-n, Minister of J~(stice' SWd women as a group be aamded co~~~titutionally entrenched equality rights? And if so, how should such Charier guarantees be crafted? These questions were among the most conkroversial issues addressed during the constitutional debaces of the early 1980s.' After much political wrangting, tbe following equality guarantees for women were provided under the Charter that was finally adopted in 1982:~ 15 (1) Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability (author's emphasis). In addition to urging the adoption of the guarantees contained in to Section 15(1), women's lobby group argued that it was afso necessary to explicitly provide constitutional protections for programs aimed at ameliorating historically disadvantaged groups, such as women. Provision of such protections were justified, it was maintained, in view of the American mmtitutional experience where courts frequently characterized grouporiented programs as \"reverse discrimination,\" and therefore ruled that such programs were unconstitutional. Thus, Section 15(2), popularly knawn as the Charter's \"affirmative action\" provision, was also entrenched in the Canadian mnstitutiod That section provides: (2) Subsection (I) does not preclude any law, program or activity that has as its object the amelioration of conditions of disadvantaged individuals or groups including those that are dhchmtaged because of race, national or ethnic origins, colour, religion, sex, age or naentd or physical disability. Buttressing the substantive equality rigfits contained in Section 15 of the Chartw are the ' Tbe iqkmntgtioa of !ktim IS was ptponed three years in order that provincial kg&lsturc aad the fedctal Partiameat awid review their respective iaws in light of the Chartw'J quality guaramccs Section 15 camc into force on April 17,19615, gender equaiity provisions found in Section 28: Notwithstanding anything in this Charter, the rights and freedoms referred to in it are guaranteed equaily to male and female persons. Ahhough the dimensions of Section 28 were not elaborated by the courts during the first decade after the Charter% adoption, the intent of the constitutional framer's was for Section 28 to set out general orienting or Interprerive principles of gender equality in order to guide judicial interpretation of the Cham, as opposed to prr~vding another substantiwe equality right. The entrenchment of this section was in large measure due to an intense lobbying effort by women's groups across Canada who believed that discrimination on the basis of sex had not hen effectively prohibited under Section IS? These group maintained that Section 28 would in effect impose an absolute guarantee of gender equality which would override any other interest? The promise and potential of the Charter of Rights Md F& appear to have prompted Canadian citizens, and women*s groups in particular, to more actively challenge in the cotins cases of alleged wx discrimination.' The result of such legal activity has in turn resulted in enhanced judicial activism% behalf of women's sex discrimination claims, and also enhanced judicial responsiveness to those claims. One of the earliest and striking earn in that regard was the landmark case of R e ~or~entafer' in which the Supreme Court of Canada affirmed a comtitutional right to abortion in ~anadr\" The iU~rgenralrr case was me of the eartie* examples of the Supreme Court's selective williltgncss to enter info the realm of policy, For example, in the Margeruafet decision Madame Justice Bertha Wilson's majority opinion enlarged the concept of liberty of the person hy introducing a new dimension, namely, the \"tight to dignity;\" that is, the right of an individual to \"a degree of autonomy in making decisions of fundamental personal importance,\" and the right to a degree of personal autonomy over important decisions intimately affecting their (sic) private lives,\" Referring to American case law, Madame Justice Wilson ruled that this liberty includes the right to many and to procreate, the right to attend private schools, etc. See, for example, Liu Goten, nte Cmrodinn Women's Movnnenr.

The tenn %difial activism' is used in the dissertation to characterize a court's inclination or propensity to intervene in the governing process - a trait which in comparative tern is marked by decisions calling for *d engineering\" and which may intmde on matters traditionally reserved for legislative or executive action.

A% discussed abve, the new consciousness about rights triggered by the constitutional debates and eventual entrenchment of the Chivter in 1982, stimulated concern among eitizcm and graups abut women's equality rights, At the onset of 1982, and particularly afier the Supreme Coun of Canada's first CWer decision in the 1984 Skapinket cage -- in which the court expressed its willingness to take a \"broad and generous\" approach to interpreting cor~stitutional rights - there was considerable enthusiasm on the part of Canadians about the potential of the new constitution for promoting and securing equality rights for women. The high expectations apparent in segments of the external Iegd culture concerning the impact of the Charter on Chdian rights and freedoms naturally encouraged increasingly rights conscious citizens to turn with renewed attention to other instruments for promoting and securing rights. One of the most important instruments available were provincial and federal buman rigbts codes, which, among other things, explicitly prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex. In the area of women's equality rights, the entrenchment of the CMer and the supreme court of Canada's eady endorsement of the i~lstrwnent as a means for securing righ appeared to have both a direct and indirect impact on the expansion of women's equality rights. Thus, in terms af a direct impact, Chmrer cases alleging sexual discrimination were rapidiy advd and successfulEy argued before Canadhn courts. Meanwhile, in a more indirect mamerp it appeared that enbanced expectations about women's equality rights emuraged women to: (1) advance mal discrimination caws utilizing other rights imhuments avahbk to them, in particular, provincial and federal human rights codes, and; (2) step-up pressure on law-makers and employers (bath in the public and private sectors) to recognize and rectifjr instances of sexual discrimination, The following section of this chapter will provide a general overview of the Chmer's direct and indirect impact in the area of women's rights and gender equity as such trends relate to bath employees ad students in Canada's public education system. The chapter concludes with a discussion of how such changes have impacted on Canada's legal culture, 11. GENDER EQUITY AWD THE P&%LIC EDUCATION SYSTEM In contrast to preCher decisions concerning sexual dirriminotion,\" decisionr from the Supreme Court of Canada after 1982 established and reinforced important aspects of equd rights for women Many of these rights will be discussed below relative to the reah of public education, For example, decisions upholding a woman's constitutional right to abortion. the right to employment bene\u0081'irs during pregnancy, and the right to be free 60m sexual harassment, indicated that the Supreme Court of Canada was adopting a fairly activist approach to issues relating to sex-based discriminatio~x. In terms of broad judicial trends in the area of women's equality rights, it was petbaps noteworthy that the Canadian judiciary after 1982 characterized the \" See, for example, AG. of Cbdb v. Law@, [I9741 S13.R 1349 and Bbir v. A.G. of [1979) 1 SCR, 183. In both cases the Supreme Court of Canada refwed to strike down Iegkkioa that <tisginninated against women on the basis of gender, unequal trealrnent of women as *sexual dixriminatioa* Thus, whether a legislative prwiaian dkscriminates against wonen, or whether women are subjeacd to inappropriate aa*ans. such as sexual harawnag the Supreme Court has treated such matters as a broader indication of discrimination on the fiasis af sex, thus entitling women to remedies available under the equality guarantees contained in both the Charter and human rights stahite~.~~ For example, on the heels of the 1988 Mogelituler abomon rights case, tbe Supreme Court of Canada issued a second landmark sexual discrimination Wing rehting to the issue of benefi~r available to pregnant employees. The case of B& v. Cd overturned a previous decision by the Supreme Court of Canada in the Bliss case that had upheld legislation restricting the axes of pregnant women to unemployment insurance benefits. In Bnwks, the Supreme Court impugned a Safeway Group Insurance Plan which provided that disability hoefits would be available for pregnancy-related illness during pregnancy, but excluded pregnant women entirely from coverage - whether their disability ** At the sanw time tbat CaMdiYl anuu bave talcen some important step in redressing sexual inequality in some cases, cowts bave also been criticized for their increasing judicial restraint in advancing the rights of women in others. For critical adysa of how the Supreme Court of Caaada has interpreted the equality provisions of the Charter see Diana Majury, \"Equality and Discrinination According to lntquality: Three Early Law Jownal, Vol. 34 (March 1989). pp. 35&367; and N, Colleen Sheppard, \"Equality, Ideology and Oppression: Women and the Canadiaa Charter of Rights and Freedom,\" LWwuie tow JbumaZ, Vol. 10 (1886x1 pp 1S.223, For a fcmini_et perspective of the Chmrer that suggests that women are not initiating coough constitutional Wenges aad that men are using the Charter \"to strike bwk at women's hard-wlon pmtectitm and benefits, see G, Brodsky and S.

Narrow interpretations of the decision haw relied upon the following smtement of the court: \"In sum, if an employer such as Safeway enters into the field of compensation for health conditions and then excludes pregnancy as a valid reason for compensation, the employer has acted in a discriminatory fashion'15 Propnents of a narrw reading of the case suggest that it can be argued that while Btwk prohibits the discriminatory refusal of an emplayer to grant pregnant women an otheNvise generally available benefit plan, it does not impose a positive obligation on employers to provide matenGty benefits. A more expansive interpretation of &wks maintains that the case stands for the general proposition that women should be entitled to an enhanced measure of benefits during pregnancy. Proponents of this interpretation rely upon the following comments by the court: it is to state rbe otnrious that pregnancy is of fundamental impomce in our wciety..,.l.t. mnot be dispute that everyone in sociery benefits from procrestion. The Safeway Plan, however, places one of the major costs of procreation entirely upon one group in sociey: pregnant womeQ In light of the enhanced profile accorded to women's equality rights in the Caaadian constitution, Canadian society and Canadian courts - as ilhsnated by the Mcqmtaier and Bbwk decisions - gender equity issues relating to school board employees and students have also received more attention within tbe Canadian public education system during the last decade.'' This section of &is chapter will examine the direct and indirect impact of the CWer on gender equity issues in Canadian schools. As with gender equality generally, the Chmer has had both a direct and indirect imjxwt on sexual dkrhination claims relating to the public education system Thus, the following dimision will examine three different impact areas of gender equality: (1) challenges under human rights des and Esrtnrur arbitrations; (2) Chmter cases, and; (3) legislative developments. '' For aa wasmcm of thir trend see, for example, May Eberts, a (Toronto: Federation of Women Teachers' Asoaamm of Onmio, 1991). Since the equality provisions of the Chafer were not operationalized until f 985, many of the early gender equity cases En the pubtic education system were initiated by rights- seeking citizens who utilized provincial human rights legislation and the grievance procedure available under collective agreements. Interestingly, one of the earliest sex discrimination employment cases wneming the pubtic scbl system was initiated by a male teacher who argued that he had been discriminated against on the basis of his sex. In the 1985 case af Rovi v. School Distia Na 57 (Prince George)\" a teacher alleged that the school hoard's deckion not ta hire him to teacb a girls' physical education class was in wiltraventian of the sex discrimination prohibition in the B.C. Human Rights Act, The BC Hummr Rights Act prohibits employers from discriminating on the basis of sex, and in particular Section 8 of the An provides: %.(I) No person or anyone acting on his behalf sball (a) refuse to employee or refuse to continue to cmployee a person, or (b) discriminate against a penon with respect to employment or because of &c...sex.-. of that penon ... Tbe school bard admitted that it had discriminated on the basis of sex in selecting a female tcacber for tbt PE pition, but maintained that there tbe bsaxrmna - -* tion, namtty, tbe maintenance of public decency, The Human Rights Council rejected the school board's position, and ruled in favour of Rossi concluding that the school board had failed to prove on the balance of probabilities that: ... direct supervision, in the sense of the physical education teacher having to be present in the change rooms, either regularly or sporadically, is necessary or required or that supervision of girls' physical education class change rooms by male physical education teachers at the schools in question does not provide either 'effective supem*sion' or the 'assistance necessary for the supervision of pupil^.'\"'^ In light of this reasoning, the Cound ordered the school board to cease similar breaches of the Hman Rights Act, namely, \"expressing a limitation, specification or preference as to sex in regard to applicants for positions as girls physical education teachers or discriminating against a person in respect of employment as a girls physical education teacher because that teacher is . .. Another public education case relating to allegations of sex-based ckwmmation was the 3985 B.C. human rights case of Spelchan mtd School Dimin No. 22\" In this case, the B.C. Human Rights Council considered an allegation of sex discrimination made by a female school bus driver against a school board. Specifically, the bus driver alleged that work was improperly allocated to a junior male employee which resulted in his seniority rights being i1lcfcase4 and thus negatively affecting ber layoff and bumping rights. After reviewing the employment practices of the school bard relating to bus driver assignments, the Human Rights Council dimis& the female bus driver's complaint concluding that driving assignments were made using criteria other than gender, and that no sex-based discrimination had taken place. In a sex discrimination case which also involved the public education system, non- teaching employees filed a complaint against an Ontario school board. In the 1986 case of Peel Bod of Educanon and CUPE Local 2703 und 2544 mrd the ~wio Human Rights ~ornmirrion* it was alleged that the school board's physical plat department maintained a system which classified employees on the basis of sex. For example, it was alleged that positions such as casual and part-time cleaners, cafeteria workers and school attendants were considered to be female occupations, while positions such as custodians* building supervisor and maiztenance employees were viewed as male occupations This discriminatory employment practice, it was alleged, perpetuated an employment system that streamed men and women into certain employment classifiations based strictly on their gender. The case was settled, without any addion of liability or any admission tbat tbe Ontario Human R&&s Code had been breached by the board. In addition to the qu1ity rights cases discussed above, another area of * chmmmation that has recently attracted considerable attention is the issue of sexual harassment, In a 1992 interview collducted with 321 business leaders by Southam Business Monitor. 47% of the executives surveyed said tbat the issue of sexual harassmtnt had been blown out of proportion, while 31% believed it was \"a real problem,\" and 17% were rt.pomdfy mwrnewbere in betweenw- Those figures compare to an October 1991 poll cmduntxl by the Angus Reid Group, where 49% of Canadians surveyed said they feel that wxud harassment is a real problem affecting the quality of life for working women, In the hge, Reid survey 37% of the women polled said that they had experienced some form of *sand harassment at workU Notwithstanding different views of Canadians on the topic of harassment, tbe CBnadian judiciary has clearly treated the issue of sexual harassment as a serious sex discrimination matter, and recently has released some very significant rulings on the iswe, Thus far, these cases have concerned challenges initiated under human rights legislation, In contrast to the situation discussed in Chapter 4 regarding the very sensitive AIDS crisis, the similarity between changing views on the issue of sexwl harassment on the parl of the legal community and the general population was quite striking. Indeed, in contrast to their pre-1982 restraint in the area of expanding minority rights, the Canadian judiciary has exhibited an urmsual degree of judicial activism in the area of sexual harassment and sexual discrimination- Thus, before turning to a consideration of sexual bafassment cases in tbe public education system it is first useful to review the Supreme Court of Canadds thin- on this issue. ti] Tk ~~ Gase In the 1981 case of RobkM v. The QueenU the issue amsidered by the Supreme \" As reported in the V- Sim, March 7, 1992, p. 1 a ( 1981). 40 DLR (4th) 5TI. Court of Canada was whether an employer was liable under the Canadian Human &ght~ Acr fof am of sexual harassment mmitttd by its crnplqecs within the mum af their emplqyment, The kindmark women's rights case arose when Bonnie Robichaud filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission alleging that she had ken sexually harassed, discriminated against, and intimidated by her employer, the Dcparunent of National Defence- She further alleged tha~ the person who actually committed the harassment was her supervisor. The Supreme Court of Canada upheld Robichaud's complaint against her employer, ruling that in order for the employer to be liable the situation in which the alleged sexual harassment takes place must in some way relate to or be associated with the empla_vment, Commenting on the issue of employer liability, Mr. Justice La Forest stated on khalf of the court that the *remedial effect of the Act would be stultified if. .. remedies were not available as against tbe employer.\" Citing the leading US Supreme Court decision in Me~irw Savirgps &urk, FSB v, ~d with approval, the Supreme Court of Canada eornmmvd on the general duties of a supepvisor towards employees as it relates to their working environment: A supervisor's respomiiilities do not begin and end with tlae power to hire, fire, and cfisciplibe employees, or the power to recommend such actions. Rather, a supervisor is charged with tbe day-tday supervision of the work environment and with ensuring - a safe, productive workplace. There is no reason why abuse of the latter authority should have different consequences than abuse of the former. In both cases it is the authority vested in the supervisor by the employer that enables him to commit the wrong; it is precisely because the supervisor is understood to be clothed with the ernplayer's authority that he is able to impose unwclmmc sexual conduct on Thc amrt also implied that the mdua of the employer in dealing with the issue of sexual harassment in the workplace may have a bearing on the issue of employer liability: For example, an cmptqfer who responds quickly and effmively to a complaint by instituting a scheme to remedy and prevent recurrence will mt be liable to the me extern. if at all, Y an employer who fails to adopt such The Jamen Caw The Supreme Court of Canada considered a second sed harassment case in 1989. In Jonrrn v. Plmy Ertlerprrjer ~cd,* the Supreme Court of Canada issued a landmark ruling which clearly stated that sexual harassment constitutes sexual discrimination, The Junzen case concerned two c~mplainants who were employed as waitresses, The two waitresses dleged that they had been subjected to unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature by the restaurant's cook contrary to the Manitoba Humarn &gk Act, and that this harassment had made the work envirorment difficult to operate in. A review mtnmai concluded that both complainantn had been victims of sex harassment and by inference sexual discrimination. On appeat, this decision was upheld in the Manitoba Court of Queen\" BeBen ch. case -**i.as further appealed to the Wtoba Corn of Appcal, who, in a surprising decision+ reversed the finding that sexual harassment b umat diwrirnina~on.~ The casc was then appealed to the Supreme Coun of Canada which restored the earlier decisions equating red harassment with sexual discrimination, In its decision in Jayen rhe Supreme Coun of Canada defined ,sexual harassment as ,,.sexual harassment may take a variety of forms. Sexual harassment is not limited ta the demand for sew& fmun madt under threats of adverse job consequences should the employee refwe: to comply with the demands, Vidms of harassment need nor derncmwaite that they were not hired, were denied a promotion or dismissed fmc~ their crnflqrment as a resuit of their refusal to participate in sexual activity, This form of harassment, in whicb the victim suffers cowete economic Iws from failing to submit to sexual demands, is simply one manifestation of mud harasmeat. Albeit a panidarly blatant and ugly one, Sexual harassment ah encompasses sintations in which sexual demands are foisted upn unwilling empbyees or in whicb the employees must eadurc sexual groping, propositions, and inappropriate comments, but where no tangible economic rewards are attached to imrohtement in the behaviour?'

In the Manitoba case, a faculty member was suspended four months without pay for sexually harassing an office assi~tant.~ In addition to ensuring that employees are able to work in a \"friendly\" environment, school boards are also required to ensure that the right of students to be educated in an environment which is safe and free from sexual harassment and sexual discrimination is maintained To date there have ody been a handful of cases where allegations of sexual harassment have been brought by students against teachers. In view of the general trend of sexual harassment litigation and arbitration, however, such eases can be expected to increase during the 1m. Among some recent cases that have been initiated by students against teachers are: Hanis and Rer'cker v. Her Majesty the Queen in R.i#ght of the Province C'bia Inninue of Tee:- rmd B.C. Caucil of Htunan Righrs*. In all of these cases. the approach of the Supreme Court of Canada was adopted in that sexual harassment was treated as sexuai discriminationJ1: For a case involving allegations of sexual harassment by a board employee against a custodian employed by a sdwol buard see Re Ottawa ofF_jfurmton EmplsVeej' Unicm (1988),2 LAC. (4th) and (1988), 5 LAC. (4th) 171. Jvnury 23, 1199, Unreported (arbitration award). * (1990). 76 D.L.R. (4th) 284 (Nfld. CA). April 4.199a Umtponed (B.C. Supreme Coun).

In Hanis and Rekker an arbitrator ruled that an appropriate penalty for a teacher who had written prns, letters, notes and an essay of a romantic nature involving a student, was a suspension without pay of approximately I1 months. The principal of the school who had not brought the matter to the board's attention, but had attempted to deal with the situation himself, was demoted from principal to teacher, and suspended for six months without pay. FoBfowing the Supreme Court of Canada ruling in Robichad, the Newfoundland Can of Appeal held in the case of Re Memorial Univers* of NaufounrUand that a University may be added as a party to human rights proceedings involving an allegation of sexual harassment made by a student against a professor. In this case, a female student alleged that she had been sexually harassed during an incident that occurred off campus when a professor allegedly invited her into a bar for a drink in order to discuss her studies. She complained that he took this occasion to sexually harass her. As for the Gami case, the B.C. Supreme Court upheld a decision of the British Columbia Human Rights Council dismissing a complaint of 21 separate sexual harassment incidents alleged by a student against the B.C. Institute of Technology. The student reportedly made the allegations following her expulsion from a sausage-making program at the Institute. The Fe Care= The Anterican Experience Although a number of Chadian arbitration and lmr court decisions have comidtrtd disciplinary cases involving student allegations of sexual harassment against board employees, the Supreme Court of Canada has yet to consider whether a school board is vicariously liable for the misconduct of its employees in relation to the sexual harassment of students. It is interesting to note, however, that the U.S. Supreme Court in the recent case of Frwrkin v. Gwinnett County Public School, has ruled that students who have been sexually harassed by teachers or other board employees may sue the school board for such harassment?' In the United States, as in Canada, sexual harassment is treated as sexual discrindnation, The United States Supreme Court decision in FtanWin overturned a ruling by a federal appeal court in Atlanta That Court had dismissed a suit brought against a Georgia school district by a high school student who charged that school officials had failed to stop a teacher forcing unwanted sexual attention on her for more than a year. The FranWin case was initiated with a lawsuit filed by Christine Franklin against the Gwimett County Georgia Schd System. Franklin, then a high xhool student, contended that for over a one year period a teacher had pursued her and forced sexual relations on her. She said that school officials were aware of the situation but that they took no action to stop it and discouraged her from pressing criminal charges. The teacher eventuaily resigned and the school closed its investigation. The Federal District Court in Georgia dismissed Franklin's lawsuit in a decision that the United States Court of Apped for the 11th Circuit affirmed in 1990. The U.S. Supreme Court ruliag overturning the lower court judgements entitled the student to sue tbe rbwl disma for failing to take action agaimt an employee who kmw or should have known was sexually harassing a ~tudent.'~ Two years after the entrenchment of the Charier's equality rights section, an Ontario teacher launched a constitutional challenge alleging sexual discrimination on the part of her professional federation. In Tomen v. The Federation of Women Teachers' AmcWn of Ontunb (FWTAO),~~ a female teacher alleged that being forced to belong to a women's affiliate of the Ontario Teachers' Federation contravened the constitution's guarantee of equality. In Ontario, the provincial teachers' federation is the Ontario Teachers' Federation (OTF), a body created by statute? One of the bylaws governing the OTF provides for compulsory membership for all female teachers who are assigned to an elementary public school in an affiliate of the OW, namely, the FWTAO.~ The teacher initiating the Following the reasoning of courts in both the United States and Canada, it could also be possible for a schooi bard to be held vicariously liable for permitting one student to sexually harass another student, For a Canadian case where one student was found guilty of harassing another student seeA v. E., Unreported, March %I992 (Ontario arbitration). \" [1987), 61 O.R. (2d) 489 (HC, aRd (1989) 70 O.R. (26) 48 (Ont. CA). On March 31, 1990 a single-member Board of Inquiry constituted under the Ontario Hwnan Rights C& released a 355~ decision in a human rights challenge advanced by Tomen against tJx MA0 and the OTF. In brief, the Board of Inquiry determined that the requirement tbat fed elementary teachers be members of the MA0 constitutes ma1 discrimination umlcr the Hwnrm R@b Code. As of April 1994 it was not clear whether the FWTAO or the OTF dd appeal this decision. ' Three other teachers challenged the bylaws on the basis of religion In Ontario teachers who teach in sepate scl#n,ls are required on the basis of religion to belong to amtkr~Of~OTE, challenge asserted that this bylaw discriminated against her on the basis of her sex, contrary to Mon 15(1) of the Chmter- In an interesting twist, the Ontario Public Schoot Teachers' Federation (OPSTF), a predominantly male organization, assisted Tomen in her challenge. Tomen and the OPSIT maintained that the gender-based regulation contravened Section 15 of the Charter because it subjected teachers to unequal treatment on the basis of sex, The FWTAO -- which had a long history of advancing the cause of women teachers - maintained that far from denying sexual equality, the regulation sought to advance equality rights for women teachers; that is, the membership requirement ensured that the FWTAO would remain an effective instrument for promoting equal conditions for women teachers. Thus, both parties invoked the equality provisions of the constitution, with one side using the Charter to attack the gender-based regulation, and the other to defend it. For its part, the cwrt amsidered the application of the equality provisions at length, finally side-stepping the Charter issue entirely by concluding that the bylaw was a corporate regulation governing inted private (as opposed to governmental) matters, and therefore outside the scope of the Chcrrer. Accordingly, the court dismissed the teacher's complaint against the OTF. In tbe coune of this muchsriticized j~dgement,~' Mr. Justice Ewaschuyk observed that, in his view, the Chmts was not intended to be \"the universal panacea that legal scholars expected it to be,\" Moreover, he explained, he did not advocate that the Cher be used as a vehicle allowing individuals to \"tyrannize a group.\" The preceding \" See, for example, Greg M. Didriason, Wate Action by Any Other Name,' A Comment on Tomen v.

To date there have been very few cases of alleged sex-based dixrimination brought by students against school bards in Canada This trend may be reversed in the 1990s as students being educated in a more rights mnsciouf legal culture begin to more actively Menge school boards to maintain and foster \"gender-friendly\" Leanring enviromnts. In the United States, one area in which students have asserted gender equality claims has related to sports teams. Thus, for example, in one case a oourt ruled that it was unconstitutional for a xbol board to deny girls the right to join a boys' tennis team and a cms-country skiing team where no such teams had been established for female students? In another case, a court ruled that female students were entitled to participate in any sport for which there was a bays' team, but not a girls' team.\" In yet another case, a murt ruled An interesting example of how children are attempting to utilize the Charter to advance their fights was recently illustrated in an Ontario case involving five children ranging in age from 3 to 13. The children argued that tbe Imnujgration Act's provisions prohibiting them from chatleqing the deportation of their guardian isfn'mged their rights u&r Section 7 and 15 of the Charter. Through their lawyer the children sought legal standing to inttrveue in their guardian's comtitutional challenge of the I- Act. On July 15, 2993, Mr. Justice -1 Moldaver of the Ontaxio Court's General Division ruled that the childttn unduu- have an interest in their guardian's court case and could be adversely aflFcctad by the outcome. The judge also ded, however, that the legal issues are so diverse and ow~~plu that a court case involving the children and the guardian would be too unwieMy for a judge to sort out As a result, he ruled that it would be inappropriate fa the children to be granted kgd status in the woman's case. GCobe d Mail, July 15, 1W3, p. 1 and Jdy lW, p. Supp. lt24 @. lm), affirmed on appeal at 477 F. 2d 1292 (8th Cir. 1973). \"Rcadv.-~dradm~tsocratron, * * 341 F.

However, the Court went on to rule that the provisions in the Ontario Hwnmt Rights C& exempting athletic aaivity from the C&'s general equality rigbts guarantees, were umm~titutional d tbcrtfore of no force and a (1986), 54 OR (2d) 513 (Omuh CA); leave to appeal denied by the Supreme of Carigda (1986), 58 OR (2d) 274. effect. Ruling in Justine Blainey's favour, the Ontario Court of Appeal stated that participation in athletics is an important deveIopment of \"health, character and discipline.\" While the cmn noted that in the field of athletic activity, distinctions that have a different impact on participants by reason of their sex may be reasonable, if there is a valid purpose for such a distinction, in this case no such purpose was established. Justine's battle for equal athletic opportunities did not end with the Ontario Court of Appeal decision. Subsequent to the appellate conn ling, sbe was offered a position playing on a hockey team which purported to offer separate but equal athletic opportunities for female hockey players- Justine challenged this alternative arguing that the woman's hdcq team did not provide an equal and acceptable sports opportunity.

During the three year period (1982-1985) that the provinriat ahd federal gwefnments mriervRed eloitctmeots with the Charier's equaIity guarantees, interest groups and women's organizations began to place considerable pressure on government officials (and private enterprises) to enact \"employment equity\" legislation and practices. Without such legislation, it was argued, the Charter's equality guarantees were meaningless. In particular, governments and private businesses were urged to implement \"pay equity\" legislation in order that the salaries and working conditions of women employees, which traditionally had lagged behind that of their male counterparts, eould \"catch-upa to that of male employees.Y During the 1982-1985 period, Judge Rosalie Silberrnan Abella, who had been appainted as the Royal Commissioner charged with enquiring into employment equity issues for the federal government, released a two-volume study recommending various measures the federal government should take in order to give substance to the equality guarantees contained in Section 15 of the ~iuarer?~ Her reoommendatiom were supported by trends reported by Statistics Canada which revealed, for example, that in 1990 women in fulltime jobs earned 67.6% of what men did?

For example, in a 1992 survey conducted by Southarn Business Monitor, 321 business leaders were interviewed about the issue of gender equity and pay equity programs. While 6 out of 10 of the CM's interviewed suggested they were in favour of pay equity for female government employees, 66% disapproved of a similai program for the private sector. Of those interviewed, 79% said that they already had a formal pay equity program in place. Only 21% said they did not have a pay equity As the issue of gender equity assumed an increasingly high profile in the latter half of the 1980s and early 19% some Canadian governments did take legislative initiatives aimed at ameliorating the historically disadvantaged position of women in the work force, including public sector education employees. In general terms, the legislation designed to protect women from employment and pay discriminatio~~ evolved though four distinct pbiws. The first phase included statutory initiatives designed to promote the idea of \"equal pay for equal work\" This concept suggested that male and female employees should be paid tbe same for doing identical work For example, a male and female school custodian under this legislation would be required to be paid the same wages. rCle second phasc of employment equity initiatives included the notion of pay for similar or subtantially similar work\" In this paradigm, even though male and female employees might bave different* titles, if they performed substantidly the same work (e.g., male custodians and fernale deaaen), employers were required both male aod female employees to be paid equal 'Ihe tbinf dewelupat related to the idea of \"equal pay for work of equal value.\" This concept differed significantly from the two preceding principles because it did not compare \"work*, but rather the %duen of work. Value was to be determined accarding to this concept by job evaluation techniques. Thus comparisons could be made between dissimilar jobs, i.e., a school board typist and and a bus driver, and if job evaluation criteria indicated that the work was of similar value, pay scales would have to bt adjusted accordingly. The theory behind this concept was that women traditionally received less pay for work of similar value that was performed by male employees. Finally, and the least evolved of the four employment equity concepts, was the notion of \"pay equity.\" The concept of pay equity was based on an assumption that pay discrimination against women is endemic in the Canadian socio-economic system, and thus necessitates a comprehensive and systemic remedy. Pay equity legislation does not only prohibit wage discrimination, but also places positive obligations on employers to review their wage practices and policies, and to ensure that such practices aod policies complied with any pay equity legis~ation.~ Employment equity legislation in each of the four areas discussed above varied considerably from one province to another by the early 1990s. In some provinces, for example, pay equity - the most far-reaching employment equity concept - was contained in new legislative pravisiom, while i~ other provinces the this issue was not addressed by statute, but was rather left to unions to negotiate in collective agreements governkg working canbitions Potentially sianificant cost increases to employers instituting pay equity schemes 99 For a mon detailed dircosdon of these various employment equity initiatives see, for example, D. Rhys Phillipq \"Equity in the Labour Market: Equ&y in Employment, Volume II. -- panicularty onerous in the recessionary economic climate of the early 1990s -- often contributed to employers' reluctance (both in the private and public sectors) to introduce pay equity schemes. (a) Ontmio's Public Education Pay Equty Program Ontario -- which has both well-organized and institutionalized te acher unions - wa one of the first provinces to implement pay equity legislation that impacted on the public education system.\" Thus, the stated purpose of Ontario's 1987 Pay Equiry A&' was to: *...redress systemic gender discrimination in the compensation of employees in fede job classes.\" In the Ontario legislation's pay equity scheme, systemic gender discrimination was to be identified through comparisons of male and female job classes in terms of compensation and work performed. Pay equity was deemed to have been achieved under the statutory scheme when *the job rate for the female job class that is the subject of the comparison is at least equal to the job rate for a male job class in the same establishment where the work performed in tbe two job classes is of comparable value.\" Judging from the experience in the United States with affirmative action programs, it was anticipated that the impleanentation of Ontario's pay equity legislation in the public school system would be a @ Othr pmVill~e~ with pay equity legislation include Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nwa Smtbt, Rince Edward Island, and the Yukon, Federal employees are also governed by pay equity legishion, complex and longterm ~ndertaking.~ As pan of Oatan03 employment equity program, a provincial Pay Equity Tribunal was estabtished which was designed to hear appeals of pay equity designations madc hy public sector employers, including xhml boards, By the early 199Ck this Charrer-inspired legislation had spawned another avenue of asserting rights claims, with boards and employee unions' appealing decisions to bath the Pay Equity Tribunal, and dso to the Ontario cmrtsarn Ontario's pay equity legislation, and the legal cbdlenges ding from the new statute provided early examptes of how the post-Charter evolution of rights consciousness and rights assertion by women employees in particular had an indirect impact on the administratian of public education. in other areas of gender equality, the issue of empwnt and pay equity in tbe pubfic education seaor will likely receive more attcfition from litigants and Canadian courts in the years ahead. IIL CHAPTER SUMMARY AND IMPLlCATlONS FOR LEGAL CULTURE There has been a very dm? relationship between gc&r eqdity issues and Cd comtitutional dcvelqmxmt in the dtcadc: after 1982 The basis for that society aver the last decade. and particularly the expressiod of those hues in the Canadian public shoot system, constituted an important area of expanding rights mnsciousness, and also iderentiaf evidence of an imponant transformation undenvay in Canada's internal and exaeml legal culture. Thus, litigants making gender equity claims attempted to make inroads into didminatory policies and practices in the field of education by utilizing several techniques such as Charter litigation, the advancement of human rights claims and rights arbitration, and also lobbying for legislative changes. Using these different avenues of legal recoarse women in the public education system challenged a variety of discriminatory pmitts including: the segregation of women teachers within a professional association; the dtd of employment opjxwtunities within tbe educational setting on tbe basis of gender; inequitable salary structure; and the sexual harassment of women teachers and students. All these efforts refleaed changes with respect to societal perceptions concerning matldatory rights for women. At the beginning of 1934 many agenda items relating to the adtamemeat of nondiscriminatory policies and practices in the Cadian education setting stfI had not btcn addressed. Howewer, as tbe American experience examined in this ckpfe?5 case study illustrated. it would kIy only be a matter of time before both the attitudes expressed by Canadiaa women in the external legal culture, and those embraced by nrcmbcn (d tbe I* communityf will result in further recognition of expanded rights for Gmdam women within tbc tducatiod scning specifically ad realm ofpndtr iartes Canadiam bad dwty begun to alter their views about what was poasd'bk and f-ilt, as such views related to women's quality issues. -=@pt-- *. advaacad aad modified Omda's legal culture in the decade after 1982. It is very difficult to make a definitive claim of a cause and effect relationship between the Chmter and the expansion of women's rights - and indeed counter- arguments to that view have been vocally advanced -- but there seems little doubt that in Canada's new constitutional context gender equality issues have assumed a higher profile and that some degree of progress has been made.

Addressing a constitutional challenge to Sunday shopping legislation, the Supreme Court of Canada thus endorsed \"the centrality of the right. associated with the freedom of individual conxience.\"' Encouraged bgr such Charter rulings, parents who either oppose religious content in the schooIs as a means of teaching moral values, or who decry the lack of Christian values in the public schl curricula proceeded to initiate several interesting and influentid Churter- Bid- Section ?(a) pan, \"keedorn of ~RdCience For interesting discussions of the &ig M Lhyg Mmt case, and Mher cases where the Supreme Court of Canada has co11sidercd Section 2(a) of the Chmter, see feds), (Toronto: Carswelt, pp. 165-194 inspired challenges.

Particular attention will be devoted to the controversies surrounding school prayer, religious exercises and instnction, as well as the contentious use of curriculum materials which allegedly promote the \"New Age\" religion of secular humanism. I. CHURCH AND STATE IN CANADA: THE HISTORICAL BACKGROUND In contrast to the United States, where all public schmls are organized along secular lines and government funding is denied to denominational schools3, Canada's public education system has traditional& been characterized by a distinctive blend of modern sccul;urism and selective public support for denominational education. Unlike the republican-minded American founding fathers, public policy-makers in early 19th century Canada were much more influenced by the dominant and powerful sectarian forces of the day! In Upper Canada (later Ontario), for example, political power was wielded by those ' Hwrver, as put of the eontrwersiai debate in the United States about \"school choice\" and a \"vwcher\" system for education, the California legislature proposed to include in a Nwember 1993 state referendum the question of whether public funds (US$2,600 for each child) should be made available to students attending private or parochial sehooIs. New Yovk E.uner;, August 4,1993, p. R8. Pvli-nrary monarchies during the modern period - fhe prototype being Great Britain - have teaded to separate the civic from the religious, but there still exists a strong camcchn between the twu thmugtr tbe hcad of state, the moifafch, also being the head of tt# church, This situation creates a symbolic mixhire of the civic and religious realms, that h iaprpulatc0aSCiOUSlPeSS the head ofstate is also the religious head Thisnotimcarries over in British infhled ~~ monarchies around the tbem hn repuMirs oueh as tbe United States. It is interesting to note tbat &ad with the Church of Englmd, and in Lower Canada (later Quebec) by those associated with the Roman Catholic church. Given the pervasive and important influence of the Protestant and Catholic denominations in the governments of Upper and Lower Canada, it was naturai that religion constituted a major dimension of the public school curricufum. Canadian educators in the 19th century believed that religion was the cornerstone of character development and the vehicle by which moral values were instilled in young children. Indeed, because religion played such an important role in moral education, religious training was considered to be more significant than traditional academic subjects such as literature or mathematics. In this spirit, the Right Reverend John Strachan, the Church of England's first bishop of Toronto, asserted: \"Kriowledge if not founded on religion is a positive evilmJ Dr. Egenon Ryerson, a Methodist minister and the Chief Superintendent of Education for Upper Canada between 1844 and 1876, agreed with Suachan's view of religion and education and endorsed the teaching of 'common Christianity\" in all spheres of the public school curriculum. Ekpressing his commitment to this educational philosophy, Ryerson asserted in a lecture in 1847: even in republics where the monarch is absent and there is some principle of separation of church and state, it is not unusual to hnd some symbolic religious dimensions, e.g., tegishwes may open with prayers and the ptedge to the \u0081'lag may acknowledge \"one nation underGod? ' from Jud Rudy, \"Religion and Education\" in Runa Ghosh and regard any instruction, discipline, or attainments, as Education, which does not include Christia nity.... It is the cultivation and exercise of man's moral powers and feelings which forms the basis of social order and the vital fluid of social happiness; and the cultivation of these is the province of Christianity.6 During the 20th century, government financed nondenominational schools were gradually replaced in Canada by schools organized on either a sectarian or secular basis? In both systems, however, religion was still viewed as an integral and necessary element of moral education. For example, a 1950 Royal Commission sponsored by the Ontario gwement suggested that religious and moral education were necessarily one in the same: Without proclaiming any creed or doctrine we know that in our democracy the Christian ideals as personified and exemplified by Jesus have an appeal to all persons of good will, and are the surest common ground for an educational programme related to the pupil as a person. The attitude of Jesus toward children, His understanding of human nature and behaviour, His charity and loving kindness toward all men, form a perfect model for a true democracy in the classroom, the community, and tbe nation8 ' J.G. Hodgins, (Toronto: Warwick Brothers & Rutter, 1899), p. 148. This chapter foeuses on the public education eum'eula. rather than denominational education. It is noteworthy, however, that since 1982 the Supreme Court of Canada has considered two comtitutional cases relating to denominational (Attorney General) v. Gmter Hd SchdBomd (1984) IS DLR. (4th) 681 (protection of de110minatiom.l schooling). For a good werview of the historical basis of denominational education see, Jud Purdy, \"Religion and Education.\" For a a##e extensive discussion d the mmtitutional status of denominational education see Gordon Balt, \"Reference Re Funding for Roman Catholic High Schools - Tiny ConvmcingIy Ckermltd Bm Epuality Rights ar Eik- (Toronto: Queen's Printer, 1950). Prior to the adoption of the Charter of Rights and Freedom in 1982, religious instruction in secular public schools dong the lines advocated by Ryerson over 100 years ago remaised prevalent in contemporary Canada The increasing ethnic, racial, and religious heterogeneity of Canadian society prompted growing criticism, however, that the traditional relationship between public education and Christianity in Canada was unsuitable and anachronistic. In the 1960s and 1970s many educators and school officials called for the fuller secularization and modernization of the public school cumculum, advocating a Canadian version of church-state separation, implicit in this philosophical and policy perspective was the conviction that teaching religion was not the only way, or even the best way, of instilling moral values? Advocacy of church-state separation naturally stimulated broader discussion and questions concerning the role of religion in the public school cumculum. In 1966, for example, the Ontario Ministry of Erfucation commissioned a major study of religious and moral education in the Ontario public school curriculum, which culminated in the controversial 1969 Mackay Repon on Reli@ous information and Religious Development. The Mackay Commission speculated that its findings would arouse controversy in at least three areas: For ao ogposite view of this position see, for example, Paul Hint, \"Public aad Rivatc Vahtes and ReUgiou3 volume, Lawremx Koblberg, Vim,\" pp. 164-183, I. the recognition of tbe rights of minorities; 2. the concept of the separation of Church and State, and; 3. the increasingly secular character of the public schools.10 While recognizing the duty of public education to foster \"character-building,\" the Mackay Report also recommended the separation of moral and religious education programs.\" Moral education should not, according to the Commission, be equated with indoctrination in specific religious precepts; rather, it should offer students an awareness of how individuals am've at moral judgments and decisions. The Report also suggested that reiigious education should be limited to factual information about the various religious positions present in society. The Ontario Government cautiously reviewed the Mackay recommendations, waiting until 1W4 before revising moral and religious education programs in accordance with the Commission's finchgs Announcing a novel departure from traditional curricuiurn development the Ontario minister of education rhetorically asked: Can we develop a system of moral education that is not based on a definite foundation of Miefs such as are found in a religion? I think we probably can, and a good start has already been made. In doing so we must be careful to present a program that eliminates any mow sectarian approach. Perhaps, then I have already implied my answer to the question, Sbould we attempt moral education in the public schools?\" For me, both as a private citizen and as Minister of Education, the answer must be an unqualified \"Yes\".\" If reggion were removed as the moral guide to education. as the Mackay Report suggested, what philosophy should provide a moral foundation for the public school curriculum? Tbis question was addressed by the Moral Education Project of the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education (OISE), the architects of the revised education curriculum. OISE's educational specialists argued that an *ultimate life goals\" or \"reflective values\" approach should be central to any viable program of education that could be expected to promote a moral education: Discussion with teachers and: students and detailed inte~tws continue to confirm that the great majority of bumau beings pmue ultimate life goals or fundamental human (and humanistic) vaIues, such as swvkd, happiness (enjoyment, pleasure, etc.), health, fellowship (friendship, love, etc.), helping others (to some extent), wisdom, fulfilment (of our \"$cities), freedom. self-respect, respect from 0th- a sense of meaning in life. and worn3 As anticipated by the Maekay Commission, tbe OISE propids provoked a public outcry Cbnktians concerning the reflective dues approach was that the approach did aot constitute a secular philosophy at a& but ratber replaced Christian values with the \"religion of secular humanism.* Asserting that the proposed curriculum would \"greatly elevate the undisclosed refigion of secular humanism in the schoow and that \"the religious face that lies behind the secular philosophy af educationM must be unmasked, one conservative Christian group suggested: It is not a question of whether or not religion will be taught The question rather is what religion will be taught and how it will be taught. Far example, if the teacher carnmunicates that the greatest value in life is \"success - in terms of prestige, wealth, or pawer - then a pmicthr religious atitude, loosely caited the \"Amenam way of lifeu has been tau* So whether it is understood as religion by either the educator or the student, religion is an integral part of all tea&ing which interprets the meaning of life or its depth dues.

SCHOOL PRAYER AND RELIGIOUS EXERCISES: THE FIRST ROUND OF CHARTIGRCASES Twenty years after the Mackay Report was commissioned, the mlitroversial question of bow to teach moral values in the public education system resurfaced in Canada's first constitutional school prayer case. In the 1986 case of Zylfwberg v. Sudbury Bud of FRurati~n,~ several Ontario parents challenged a regulation made under the Ontario Edkcrrion ~cf'~ which stipulated that Ontario's public schools must offer compulsory religkw exercises. Tbe legislation also provided that should students have a religious objection to participating in this aspect of the curridurn hey dd, upon parental request, be exempted from tbe religious exercises. The petitioners in tbe ZyIberberg case raid two maia objections to the legidation, First, they contended that requesting exemption from rel3giats activities pressured or coerced pupils into participating in tbe exercises, thereby (1986h 55 OR (Zd) 749 ((Om. Div. Ct). infringing their constitutiond right to freedom of conscience and religion under Section 2(a) of the Ctzmer. Second, they charged that the same regulation - which only prescribed Christian religious exercises - discriminated against nonxhristians contrary to the constitution's equality guarantees.'7 The majority of the three-member Ontario Divisional Court panel which beard the case was not persuaded by either of these two arguments and dismissed the parents' claim. In ruling @nst the parents the two members of the court mncluded that the Ontario Edtccation ACZ provisions were not unconstitutional, and that pressure tending to influence a pupil to participate in religious exercises against the dictates of the student's conscience did not violate the student's freedom of conscience or religion. With respect to the equality argument raised by the plaintiffs, Mr. Justice O'iRary who wrote the court's majority judgement, ruled that the regulation was not discriminatory because it did not stipulate specific Christian exercisescises Stating his position on the issue of \"religiw tolerance,^ Mr. Justice O'Leary remarked: Where a country is founded on tbe principle of the supremacy of God there is no obligation on tht schools to spend the same profit reinforcing the belief of non- believers that God does not exist as in teaching believers abut the nature of God. Religious exercises for those who wish to take part, in the absence of any attempt to support the paposition God does mt exist is no more thsur a reasonable limit, prcscri'bad by law, reasonably justified in a free and demoaatic society, on the right of a aon-btlicver to equal educationat benefit.'' Mr. Justice O'Laary went on 10 voice his moral eonviaions regarding the exercise of Christian exercises in public sehwls: Our schools have an digation to teach morality. Whilt some may argue that morality can be taught withour; associating it with God, few would deny that in the minds of most persons morality and religion are intertwined and that to -ate Gad and morality is an effective way of teaching rnora~ity.~ Moreover, he asserted, because Cdian society is founded on tbt supremacy of God -- and considering that regular church attendance is the exception rather than the rule - eare must be talcen not to put \"unnecesrj;uy obstacles* in the way of public sfitwols \"bringing our children in touch with God by prayer, reflection and meditation as a means of instilling in them the morality required for Ioeial order aod individual happinessg Another member of the paacl chgeed with the majority ruling in the ZyIbt.rizt?rg Seaion 2(a) of the Chmler. Suggesting in his dissenting judgment that the quality of freedom d any society is measured by the way it treats its miaoritiea, Mr. Justice Reid owtctudtd that any form of reiigious exercises violates tbe Ch4PIm's guarantca of universal equality d freedom of 15 ~ewkir humanism a religion? Maav people. both hummist and other, would argue that it is not. On the other hand, hth theists and humanis &...take the contrary pition. %me theists may try to limit religion to theism, a defition which eliminates some other important Eastern religious traditions. It ah fails to recognize the element of faith in the secular world view. The faith is different from that of the theist, but is nevertheless faith, and a number of humanists find no contradiction in affiliating with bodies that call themselves religious. Some humanists argue that what others believe is religion but what they themselves believe in anti- religion. But it ean be held that their anti-religion is also a religious perspective.\" Encouraged by tbe Divisional Coun's strong dissenting judgement, parents of the children opposed to the mandatory religious exercises, appeded the majority decision. On September 23, 1988, thc Ontario Court of Appeal overturned the lower court Zylberherg deckion and ruled that the regufation in the Ontario Educdion Act mandating school prayer vu contrary to Section 2(a) of the ~horter.~ lo a 4-1 opinion, the Court of Appeal conduded that requiring public school students to participate in school prayer is \"antithetical\" to the constitution% objective of promoting freedom of conscience and religion. Moreover, the Coun remarked, \"the recitation of the Lord's Prayer, which is a christian payer, and the reading of scriptures from tbe Christian Bible impose Christian observances upon mn-christian pup& and religious observances on non-believers.\" Overturning the Wonat Coun majority spinion, the Coun of Appeal rejected the argument that the * A 1988 arrwy by th Ontario PuMc School Trustees' hwchtion revealed that at the the of the 2- appeal cant decision, 39 out of 56 member boards required recitation ol thc LMcrs Prayer in ekmemvy and 36 boards required school prayer in high xbooh Ca&m Ptm, stpttmber 25,1988 school prayer exemption in the regulations to the Education Act -- which allowed students to abstain from prayer at parental request - offered genuine freedom of choice for religious minorities. The exemption provision, according to the court, served to impose a penalty on pupils from religious minorities who utilized it, \"by stigmatizing them as them as non-conformists and setting them apart from their fellow students who are members of the dominant religion.\" Moreover, the court pointed out: While the rnajoritarian view may be that s. 28 [of the Ontario Educahon Act regulation] confers freedom of choice on the minority, the reality is that it imposes on religious minorities a compulsion to conform to the religious practices of the majority. The evidence in this case supports this view. The three appellants chose not to seek an exemption from religious exercises because of their concern about differentiating their children from other pupils. The peer pressure and the class- room norms to which children are acutely sensitive ... are real and pervasive and operate to compel members of religious minorities to conform with majority religious practices.\" As in earlier Supreme Court of Canada decisions considering the Chmter's guarantee of religious freedom, the Ontario Court of Appeal's conclusions in the Zylberbq case were based in large measure on U.S. decisions relating to the guarantee of religious freedom in the Fit Amendment to the US. amstitution. Thus, notwithstanding the differences in wording between the religious freedom clauses in the U.S. and Wadian constitutionsn, the Court of Appeal relied on two landmark American school prayer cases from the 1960s \" The First Amendment to the American Constitution states that 'Congress shall make no law rtspectiag an establishment of refigion.\" This \"establishment dause\" as it has come to be known is the basis for the separation of church and state which characterizes the American system. which ruled that mandatory religious exercises were unconstitutional. Referring to the two U.S. cases of Abingron v. ~chernp~~ and Engel v. Ktale\" the Ontario Coun of Appeal remarked: Two conclusions can be drawn from the American decisions. The first is that the absence of an establishment clause in s. 2(a) [of the Cmer] does not limit the protection it gives to freedom of conscience and religion. The second is that support can be found in Abington, the most recent [U.S.] decision on school prayer, for our conclusion that the compulsion on students to conform and not exercise the right of exemption is a real constraint on the freedom of conscience and religion guaranteed by the chartersm Thus, in the Ontario court's view, the essence of the concept of freedom of religion is the \"right to entertain such religious beliefs a,q a person chases,' and the right to be free from a compulsion \"to conform to the religious practices of the majority.\" Like the American constitution, the decision pointed out, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Fm&m serves to \"safeguard religious minorities from the threat of the tyranny of the majority.\" The Zylbderg case constituted a fundamental benchmark in Canadian jurisprudence and was also a key indicator that a profound change was occumng in Canada's legal culture. Traditional resistance and obstacles in the Canadian legal culture with regard to the expansion of rights (see Chapter 2) - a feature of the Canadian legal culture which 28 374 US. 203 (1963). \" 370 US. 421 (1- Zylbsbe7g, 1988, p. 659. distinguished it from trends south of the border -- were gradually being eroded by the impact of the Charter and the new mindset of Canadian legal professional and interest activists. After Zylberberg, members of Canada's legal community would not be surprised when important aspects of American rights-oriented jurisprduence would be selectively utilized and incorporated by Canadian judges to underwrite or uphold more expansive notions of minority rights. 2. B,C and Manitoba School Prayer Cam By 1989 British Columbia and Manitoba were the only provinces requiring public schmls to conduct religious exercises. Following the lead of the plaintif% in the Zylberberg case, parents and students in both B.C. and Manitoba launched oonstitutional challenges to schml prayer legislation that was similar to the statutory provisions attacked in Ontario's ZY- -- In 1986 the B.C. Civil Liberties Mation, along with two mothers of school-age children, challenged legislative provisions in the B.C. School Ad that authorized mandatory school prayer and bible reading. At the time the court case was initiated recitation of Christian schooI prayer and Christian bible readings were widespread in British Columbia dagsrocbms, particularly in nual areas and in elementary schools. The centrai concern of the parents m the rhaol prayer case of Rusmv rmd Lodt~ v. Aitomq, Gaeml of BC?' was tbaf the mandatory education legislation compelled their children to follow a particular religious belief. At issue in the case was a provision in the B.C. School Act which stipulated: A11 public schools shall be opened by the reading, without explanation or comment, of a passage of Scripture to be selected from readings prescribed or approved by the Lieutenant Governor in Council. The reading of the passage of Scripture shall be followed by the recitation of the Lord's Prayer, but otherwise the schools shall be conducted on strictly secular and nonsectarian principles. The hi hest morality shall be inculcated, but no religious dogma or creed shall be taught.' f As in Ontario, a regulation to the B.C. legislation further provided that children could be exempted from the religious exercises should their parents make that request.= The parents in Russow and Lamberr argued, however, that this exemption was coercive and insensitive to the views of minorities, and maintained that even though the mandatory school prayer legislation contained exemption options, the statutory provisions were contrary to Section 2(a) of the Charter. Prior to the B.C. Supreme Court ruling, the B.C. Social Credit government -- headed by Premier Bill Vander Zalm and characterized by a strong conservative Christian elemen?'$ -- toyed with a possible compromise solution to the school prayer irsue, namely, Section 164, R.S.B.C. 1979, c, 375. Regulation 436/81, s. 140. For example, in 1987 the B-C government became the first provincial legislature to designate a special legislative \"prayer room\" Newspaper coverage reporled th': \"ensconced in a third-\u0081'loor room in the legislature building [about 25 people] spent an hour offering up prayers for B.C. Premier Wi Vander Zalm, Cabinet ministers, the opposition, even repone=.-- prayed for tougher liquor laws, for no increase in gambling in the province; for proper\" legislation to be passed\" The prayer room initiative was not surprising, originating as it did fiom a Premier who had expressed public support of certain policies and practices, (e.& school prayer, an increase in private schooi fundin& a ban on abortion dinics, curtahem of sac education, etc.) on the basis of his private Christian beliefs. Within less than one week, hestted disputes empted between different fundamentalist the introduction of legislation requiring students to participate in a minute of silence each day. While the idea was novel for Canada, similar legislation in the United States had been struck down as unconstitutional, and before the provincial government had an opportunity to mwe ahead with the idea, the B.C. Supreme Court -- concluding that the mandatory school prayer legislation in B.C. was \"indistinguishable\" from the Ontario legislation considered in the ZyIberberg case -- struck down the school prayer provisions in the B.C. School ACT as unconstitutional. When the B.C. education legislation was revamped in 1989 the new legislation (Section 95) simply provided that: all schools \"shall be conducted on strictly secular and non-sectarian principles,\" and that \"the highest morality shall be inculcated, but no religious dogma or creed shall be taught in a ~hool.\"~ Meanwhile in Manitoba, Premier Gary Filmon remained adamant that Manitoba's compulsory school prayer law would not be amended despite the B.C. and Ontario court cases. Manitoba's school prayer case had been initiated in 1986 under the province's human rights legislation, when a 17-year-old student, Christopher Tait, challenged his five-day expulsion from his rural Manitoba high school for refusing to stand for the Lord's prayer.% TIte student, who was an atheist, said that if he stood during the reading of the Lord's prayer \"it would be a tribute to the brd God\" and unacceptable to him. Tait was individuals and groups with respect to control and scheduling of the room.

Instrwtion and tbe Elain Case At the same time the various school prayer cases were being litigated, ari Ontario school board -- reacting to pressure from conservative Christian parents and groups who opposed the increasing secularkation of the public school curriculum - adopted a new curriculum of religious education for its elementary s~hools.~ A number of Christian fundamentalist groups offered to assist in the instruction of the \"comparative religion\" component of the new public schooI cumalum Thus, at the same time a group of Ontario parents had launched constitutional challenges aimed at removing religion from the public Vc~tcouver Sun, Jarmary 11,1986, p.BS. v.

The decision in the case was still pending as of early 1994. school c~rriculum, other Ontario parents were endorsing the idea of introducing into the public school curriculum religion classes taught by fundamentalist groups.*' The Canadian Civil Liberties Association (CCLA), which had been monitoring these deveiopment.5 in Elgin County, charged that the Christian fundamentalist groups were not in fact teaching comparative religion, but were rather seeking to propagate fundamentalist Christian doctrine under the guise of education In support of this contention, the CCLA refened to lesson plan objectives designed by fundamentalist teachers which proposed \"to teach students that the believer's -ask is giving of the Gospel to all the world.\" In addition, the CCLA contended, students were encouraged by the fundamentalist instructors to give money to help \"the caw\" and \"to spread the Gospel\" to their neighbours? Responding to allegations that they were using the public school system as a vehicle for religious indoctrination, the fundamentalists maintained that their focus on Christianity fell within the cumculum guidelines and a regulation under the Ontario Educabn Act which required scbaul boards to provide two, one-half periods a week \"devoted to religious education\" with instruction \"69. teachers, clergy, or lay people.\" Moreover, these groups referred to Ontario's religious curriculum guide, the 1949 \"Brawn Book\" (that had been out of print and circulation for wer a decade), which info& teachers that \"the wakening and guidance of the spiritual sense in children is the first factor in creating the hnest fruit in individual '' Gruups nrb as the Child Evangelism Fellowship, Christian Service Centres of Caaada. the scripre Union and the Bible Club Movexwnt flourished in pubic schools in Ootario'ssmalkr~11~1~ll1t3e~, . \" For example, in tbe mid-1980s the Christian Service Centre of CIllnada wt religion in 42 schools in two Ontario counties, character, and consequently in the happiness and right development of the race.\" When the Elgin Cowq School Board refused to abandon its practice of allowing fundamentalists to teach religion courses, the CCLA launched a clonstitutianai challenge against the school board which maintained that fundamentalist instruction in the public schmls violated Section 2(a) and Section 15 of the Ch~rter?~ in essence, the CCLA lawsuit maintained that instruction weighted in favour of Christian religious beliefs constituted religious indoctrination in the guise of education contrary to the constitutional guarantees to religious freedom and equality regardless of religious beliefs. On March 28, 1988, a panel of the Ontario Divisional Coun ruled in a split decision that the Ontario education regulation governing religious instruction, and the use of evangelical Christians to teach religion courses, were not contrw to the Charter's religious freedom and equality section^.^ In a Z@page judgment, the majority of the court concluded that there was nothing in the regulation or the Education Act \"which evinces a sectarian purpose of religious indoctrination in majority Christian precepts.\" Moreover, tbe Court noted the regulation could hardly be considered unconstitutional as it stipulated that issues \"of a mntrwersial or sectarian nature shall be avoided.\" Notwithstanding that evangelical \"volunteers\" had been used to teach the religion curriculum, the must mnclucfed that one of the factors giving rise to its conchion that the regulation was constitutional was that \"the instruction is offered through the kd's teachers, rather than clergy-mrninated surrogates Author's hite~ew 1%. whose self-interest and fervour may tend to colaur the nature or content of their instruction-*45 Mr. Justice Austin dissented from the majority opinion, remarking that he had no choice but to conclude ttrat the regulation \"was calculated to permit the indoctrination of whwl children in Ontario in the Christian faith and that it is being used for that purpose at the piesen1 the.\" ThereFore, in bis view, the regulation was ul[fconstitutiod and should be declared void. Largely on the strengtb of the court's dissenting oginion, tbe CCIA sucoessfully appealed the majority opinion thc Divirioaal Court to tha Ontario Coon of ~ppeal.~ Thus, in 1!?90 the appellate corn overturned tbe lower court dedsios, ruling that the uneonstitutionat.

THE iW%DAMENTALISF CHALLENGE TO PUBLIC EDUCATION: THE IWLIElEW US EXPERIENCE It is interesting that during the late 1980s and early 1!HQ when Canadian parents and interest groups were initiating constitutional challenges aimed at removing Christian reUgiow influences from the public school curriculum, churcbstatt 0011stitutional litigation in the United States was dominated by conservative Christian parents and interest groups who were attempting through cwn challenges to re-introduce Christian values into the public school cuniculum. Thus ironically while Canadian courts were adopting landmark U.S. Supreme Court dings brom the 1- to support tkir ooastitutiod decisions separating religious indoctrinan'on from public school instruction, US. courts were re- examining those earlier decisiom Indeed, in inany US. cases plaintiffs were beginning to makc inroads on the traditional waIl separating the church from statesponsored activities, sueb as public educati~n,~ Because of the important influence of tbe U.S. eburch-state relationship on developments within the religious and judicial sectors of Canadian society, Mme turning to a discussion of the recent evolution of Canadian xhmt/retigion oonstiturional developments, it is useful to consider constitutional developments in the United States relating to the \"religion\" of secular humanism in the public school cumculum. Seeking to reverse the alleged erosion of moral standards in contemporary society, the religious right in the United States chose the public school system in tfie mid-19s0s and arty 1890s as one of the major arenas in which to crusade for a \"moral re-ce\" . grounded upon conservative Chnstran values. American fundamentalist Christians voiced particularly harsh criticism about the absence of Christian Wes and examples &om the public school cumculum, maintaining for example, that \"public schools have become and tht public schools arc 'so Men tbat thy have become jungles,\" In dxtEel.lging the cunhhm of the public sdrools, ttK fumhmmtalist right in the ptohi%ited Bible reading in public schools but expressly sanctioned non-sectarian religious education, 3. US, Secular Humaaism Cballenpps u The Smith Case In 1987, increasingly dissatisfied by the secuJar nature of the school cumculum, 624 parents, teachers and students - the majority of whom were fundamentaiist Christians -- sued an Alabama school board- The plaintiffs' central claim in Smith v. Bod of School Commirrionm of Mobile ~iwtrty,~ was that the school curriculum - particularly 44 elementary and secondary school texts in home economics, history and social studies -- promoted the nontheistic religion &secular humanism while ignoring the important role of the Christian religion in Americau Life. They charged, for example, that history and social swdie texts systematically omitted references to the religious aspects of American history, neglect& key components such as the Pwitans, colonial missionaries, women's suffrage, temperance, civil rights d the peace mavement. Such omissions, the plaintiffs alleged, inh~%ited the frec exercise of religion. Moreover, tbey maintained, imposing secular bumanist kkfk &rough the public sclxml dculum was tantamount to enshrining the new religion of *secuh h- which violated the separation of church and state. in a surprising decision Alabama Federal District Court Judge W. Brevard Hand agreed with the allegations of the fundamentalist Christian parents, and ordered the removal of 44 textbooks from Alabama public schools. In a 172-page ruling, Judge Hand concluded that the school texts unconstitutionally promoted the \"religious belief system of secular humanism,\" and omitted the role of Judeo-Christian religious teachings in American history. This decision represented the first recognition by a North American court that secular humanism constituted a \"religion.*s At the time of the Smith decision, secular humanism was a relatively new concept in litigation and many observers characterized the concept as a *term of art\" relied upon by conservative Christians to explain a11 the shortcomings and evils present in North American society. One editorial columnist concisely described the scope and meaning of secular humanism as the concept was used by the fundamentalist plaintiffs: To some adherents of the religious right, 'secuiar humanism' had a dehaite meaning. It stands for everything they are opposed to, from atheism to the United Nations, from sex education to the theory of evolution, to the writings of Herningway and Hawth~rne.~ \" Tbe concept of \"secular humanism' was mentioned as a footnote in the U.S. Supreme Couct case of Torurrso v. Watk-inr, 367 US. 488 (1%1), where the Court recognized in dicta (p. 495, n 11) that secular humanism is \"among the religions in this country which do not W what arould generally be considered a belief in God.\" It is unlikely that in 1%1 the Coun could have foreseen the legal implications of this passing referee. For other cases which also refer to, but do oot ftsohre this issue, see: Gme v. Mead Sdml Dist. No. 354, 753 F2d 1528 (9th Cir.), cert. denied 106 S. Ct. 85 v. of the Iriral values\" and %id diches\" promoted by secular \"Religion tbe Fundamentalist VoL 2, Tlkkwt, (December 1987), p. 64. Self-professed humanists conceded that humanism, along with the great world religions, involves a moral posture and expresses normative values. However, they did not agree with the Christian fundamentalist viewpoint that secular humanism is a religious movement in the conventional sense, i-e., a belief system that endorses a divine or supernatural authority dictating man's moral obligations and prescribing how man should lead his everyday life.\" Commenting on the Smah case, a supporter of the Mobile County School Board, thus observed: I think this is the first time a religion has been defined and created by its antagonists. It might be called the emperor's new religion -- it appears to exist only in the eyes and minds of the beholders .... It apparently means anything with which the religious right di~agrees.~ The court order to remwe the suspect textbooks tiom Alabama public schwls -- at least some of the 44 books were used in 114 of Alabama's 129 school dismcts - threatened to disrupt the completion of marry of the 1987 spring semester activities. The Mobile County consequently appealed the court order. Dexribing the court-ordered immediate ban as a \"draconian remedy,\" a federal appeals court temporarily suspended Judge Hand's order pending an appeal on the merits of the case. Shortly thereafter, the 11th Circuit appeals cowt reversed Judge Hads ruling completely, concluding that his decision had improperly -- See, Morris B. Storer, Himmist Ethics~ Dialogue on Bcuiw (New York: Prometheus Boob Paul Kurtz, ed, Moral Problems in Ontemporary Society: Essays in Hwnanisa'c Ethics (New Jew Prentiad-fa& 1969). John H. Buehsaao. Chakman of People for tbe American Way, New Yo& nnw. March 8, lW, p. 24. changed the constitutional requirement that the government should be neutral with respect to religion into an affirmative obligation for the government to speak about religion.@ (b) 77~ Mozerr Case For many observers, Judge Hand's unusual ruling in the Smith case represented judicial activism at its worst. If the case had not been part of a burgeoning litigation strategy by evangelical Christians aimed at eradicating the alleged anti-Christian threat to public schooling, observers would have simply dismissed the ruling as a bizarre anomaly. But similar litigation in other parts of the U.S. was also being upheld by district court justices. For example, in a 19&i Tennessee case, a group of fundamentalist Christian parents succeeded in obtaining a court order sheltering their children from the \"godless influencew allegedly present in certain public school textbooks. Charging that the Tennessee textbooks promoted the \"religion of secular humanism,\" the plaintiffs in M~ert v. Hawkins C- Public Scbrj6' requested that the Dismct Court nprotect\" Christian children from xhoolbooks \"infected\" with this creed. Asserting that \"the word of God is the totality of my beliefk,\" one of the plaintiffs testified that she was offended by such stories as \"A Visit to W which she said seed to embody thought transfer or telepathy and supernatural powers - btlicfb which she considered were matters only within God's domain. Objections wcre atso raid to Anne Frank's Dimy of a Yw Gid, mte~lsibly because the young Jewish @ 827 F.

'Our children's imaginations have to be bounded,\" one plaintiff testified, after describing a reading exercise in which seventh graders were asked to imagine themselves a part of nat~re.~ Following the court ruling upholding the plaintiffs' claims, children in Tennessee school districts were provided with the opportunity to \"opt out\" of classes using textbooks that discussed, for example, the \"philosophies\" of super-naturalism, male-female role reversal, pacifism and situational ethics. The Hawkins County school board appealed the court order, and just days before the 1987 appellate decision wemrned the book ban in Smith v. The Boafd of School Commissioners of Mobile County, the Mozert decision was also reversed63 In overturning the lower court decision, the appellate court concluded that public school students may be required to read and discuss textbooks even though the lessons do not reflect their religious beliefs. Christian fundamentalists were handed another lega! blaw in 1!%7 when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a 7-2 decision that Tennessee legislation which permitted the \" EduMian Week, November 6, 1986, p. 19.

In reaching its decision, the majority of the Court held that no evidence had been adduced to support the state's contention that the legislation was designed to offer a \"balanced\" cumhJum and to advance academic freedom In fact, the Court ruled, the legislation was clearly intended to advance the religious viewpoint that a \"supernatural beiq$ created humankind. Despite these setbacks, the religious right in the United States declared its intention to carry on with its opposition to the secular public school curriculum. For example, referring to their commitment to fight \"the promotion of godlessness and secular humanism\" despite three successive failures in court, one fundamentalist spokesman asserted: \"We're going to utilize the system that's made America great and proceed to exhaust all those possibilitiesd IV, THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT IN CANADA FIGHTS BACK= THE REACTION TO FIRST WAVE OF CHARflER CASES Although the debate about the absence of religious values in the public school \" Emulmic v.

For example, conservative religious activists in Canada have clearly been distressed by the post-Charter judicial activism which has removed religious exercises and materials from the public school curriculum, and which has allegedly resulted in the disintegration of academic and moral standards. As in the United States, Canada's religious right has condemned public schools for failing to provide children with religious values, a practice which is tantamount they charge, to promoting and teaching the anti-Christian philosophy of secular humanism The division of parents into camps based on their attitudes and views about the proper role of religion in the public scbwk exemplifies some of the diverse pressures brought to bear on Canada's changing legal culture during the last decade. Thus, in reaction to the first wave of Charter cases discussed in Part II of this chapter, wnservative Christian parents in the late 1980s aad early 19905 began to demand that thet children's constitutional rights to freedom of religion should also be recognized by local school boards. This section of the chapter will discuss the first signs of a backlash on the part of co~z~ervative Christians against the successful efforts by Canadian litigants to reduce the role of religion in the public dm1 system, During the early 1990s a number of local school boards throughout Canada were faced with irate fundamentalist Christian parent groups threatening to remove their children from classes if school officials did not ban a particular series of readers -- the Intpresswns wries - from the school cumculum. The Caaadian readers which, it was estimated in 1992, one out of every two Canadian elementary schoolchildren read6q included works by authors such as Lucy Maud Montgomery, Margaret Atwood, Chief Dan George, Dr. Seuss, A. k Miine, C, S. Lewis and Rudyard Kipling. The series is comprised of some 60 books and support manuals, as well as transparencies, work sheets and audiotapes for teaching children in grades one through seven. By 1993, all Canadian provincial education ministries, but three (Newfoundland, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island) had adopted the lrnp'es5ions cuniculum material. After some Canadian educators protested that the series was too morbid, a new version was published in 1988, eliminating the offending passages. Despite such revisions, beer. many parents on the religious right continued their opposition to the series. In Calgary, for example, a group called Parents for Quality Education, argued beginning in 1990 that the series promom \"secular humanism in the classroom.\" According to a spokesperson for the group (wbich reponedly had over 1,000 members), the parents wanted ' Aocording to David Bcmth, a profkssor of literature at the University of Toronto and oneaftheseries'fivean~-cdirtlrs.

But she added, \"new age and occultism is a religion and they're indoctrinating children into it.lh9 Those individuals and groups opposed to the growing pressure from parents, considered that tbe activities by the religious right were \"an insidious attempt by a network of right-wing activists to undermine the secular school system.\"m Thus, while the parents' group alleged that the series exposes students to themes of violence, witchcraft, death and '' Canadian Prer, April 12, 1992.

However, only two of the eight elemenmy schooIs voted to reinstate the series. despair, educators praised the stories as imaginative fantasy that stimulates a love of reading in children and exposes them to various authors and culture^?^ Although Canadian-based opposition to the Impressions series in the early 1990s was limited to protest campaigns targeting local school boards as opposed to constitutional challenges, the Canadian series sparked legal action in four U.S. states where xhoof hards had adopted the seriesn For example, in California a lawsuit on behalf of fundamentalist Christian parents alleged the Irnpesiurn series promotes witchcraft, \"neo-paganism,\" and the \"New Age religion\" of secular humanism in the public school curriculum in violation of the US. constitution's first amendment. The American Family Law Association, a religious right organization that represented the parents, argued that U.S. Supreme Court rulings that banned prayer from U.S. schools ought to apply to all religions equally and that the lrnpreswns series should be banned from schools. In mid-1992 a U.S judge rejected the parents' claim and ruled that the series are part of folklore and literature and do not represent a New Age religion as claimed by the parents. Suggesting that an appeal would be filed in the case, the iawyer for the American Family Law Association criticized the TI Objectionable stories cited by the parents included a story \u0081'rom a Grade 3 teacher ethology where a witch apprentice is told: \"You deserve to die for this, but I will spare yow life on one condition Bring me the hearts of your mother and sister and you shall live. Not only shall you live, but you shall become one of us. We will turn you into a mighty witch, and ycw shall help your wife to work evil.\" Another example is \"Inside My Feet,\" a story in a Grade 4 teacher anthology, about a boy who does battle with a pair of enchanted boots. \"Underneath my bed was a large and cold hand that also watched and waited for me to dangle a naked arm or leg over the side so it could drag me screaming into that dark pit wbere it would rip and smother me until I was dead and tonnent me afterward But there was nothing unusual in that.

Arguing that the high school biology curriculum indoctrinated students with the false theory of \"evolution\" - a theory which the Christian right in Canada like their counterparts in the U.S. identifies with the religion of secular humanism -- the parents demanded that creationism also be included in the biology cumrulum. Maintaining that creationism was a legitimate and strict science (based on the belief that fossils disprove evolutionary theory by indicating that some species became extinct, while others appear abruptly, ie., they are created by God), the fundamentalist group offered the school board alternative curriculum materials that had been developed by tbe San Diego-based Institute for Creation Research. After a long and rather heated public debate, the fundamentalist lobby succeeded in having creationism included in the biology cumdurn as an alternative theory to evolution. The British Columbia Ministry of Education also agreed to alter the evolution question on the Grades 11 and 12 provincial \" Globe and Mid, Apd 7, 1992, p. A8. 248 biology examinations. At the beginning of the 1990s at least two of B.C.3 75 school districts auttrorized credonisrn to be taught in science ciasses. A similar incident occurred in Ontario in 1998 when new biology education guidelines for the Ontario public school system came under attack by fundamentalist Christians &acating the \"science* of creationism The Creation Science Association of Ontario strongly opposed the drahs of the biology guidelines, and particularly objected to those sections of the guidelines which suggested that vestigial organs and embryological similarities demonstrated the validity of the theory of evolution. An Ontario Ministry of Education official denied that the new biology cumculum was attemptink fr, promote a completely areligious and secular view of development- Defend* the guidelines he stated that: \"What we are trying to show the kids is bow scientists view the world and not that religion is wrong.\" The creationism debate follo-wed on the heels of earlier criticisms Erom fundamentatkt Christian parents about Ontario's draft physics ~culom, In mid-1987, a University of Toronto astronomy professor working on the draft revisions for Ontario's high s&w1 physics courses charged that pressure from creationists aad the religious right was \"forcing the ministry to distort the science CUfficulur~~\" In particular, tbe Toronto astronomer objected to tbe Ministry's directive -- prompted by strong parental pressure - that be substitute the words \"clevel~nt* and \"changem for *ewolution\" in desaiptions of the history d tbe universe. Thc astn,mmy professor also took issue with the Edudon Mhkuyfs request that th: new physics auriculum mt make reference to the \"scientifidlf determined age of the sun. The Ontario Ministry of Education tater reversed its position on buth these issues to the satisfaaim of the scientists invalved in the draft curriculum changes. Issues touching an retigious beliefs, and also the appropriate boundaries between the state and religious values, have been among the most antenu'ous and difficult problems facing democratic societies. 11 is therefore not surprising that Canada's new Chrutcr oj Rig.hrs and F~~ would engender special concerns and sensitivities on the part of thuse citizens attuned to the protedan, retrenchment or expansion of religious beliefs in the educational setting. Concern in Canada during Ihe last decade regarding the appropriate role of religious beliefs in tbe public shod ~~fl'idwn revealed important changes in Canadian rights CORSC~OUS~~SS and legal culture.

If these components of the legat system f i.e., the internal legal culture) respond positively to the rights daims made by citizens and groups (i-e., the external legal culture), there is an incremental expansion in the framework for rights adjudication, protection, and expansion, a11 which in rurn creates increased expectations and a fresh round of citizen demands. The end result of this spiral may be, as the Canadian case amply indicates, a radically altered legal culture.

THE DISSERTATION'S FOCUS AND FINDINGS: A SUMMARY Rule-of-law is the quintessential element of a democratic society. Without the presence of institutionalized legal norms that are valued and supported by both ruling authorities and citizens, other dimensions crucial to the operation of the democratic process - such as the regular alteration of political leaders, a framework of civil liberties, and the free interplay of economic relationships - are devoid of significance. Fundamental changes in the principles and practices of a legal system become, therefore, a moment of profound impon;uuje in the development of a democratic society. The repatriation of the Canadian constitution in 1982 and its elaboration with a \"made in Canada\" Chmter of R&h& and Fmedomr represented jut such an historical benchmark and new beginning for the functriouiag of ckinadiaa democrary. This dissertation has endeavoured to am&z and assess the first decade of legal GMe d Md, April 17.1% p. All. 254 development under Canada's new constitutional framework through an examination of selected issues relating to the field of public education. The theoretical construct utilized to guide the analysis was the concept of \"legal culture,\" that is, the values and attitudes of opinionmakers and citizens regarding the law and law-related facets of society. Special attention was focused on two key dimensions of the legal culture, its intental component and its external component. The internal legal culture encompasses the attitudes and values of the direct participants in the practice and adjudication of law, and particularly the outlook and behaviour of judges and members of the legal profession. In many respects, the internal legal culture can be termed the \"lawyers' culture.\" The external legal culture refers to citizen or lay attitudes and values regarding legal matters, and constitutes the broader context in which the internal legal culture functions. These two major aspects of the legal culture are separate, but very closely related aspects of one essential phenomenon Thus, the lawyers' culture is constantly sbaped by the grievances, demands, and beliefs of the lay members of a society, while at the same time legal opinion-makers and practitioners, through their actions and priorities, shape the manner in which tbte broader society views tlre legal system The primary pal of this dissertation has been to ascertain how key issues relating to the system of public education in Canada have been by the mmtitutional cSraages in tbc post-lW period, and whetber those changes have oontnited to a fitoclsuncnM ~OrrmatiOn or evolution in the 00ulltry\"s internal and external legal cultures. The fonr issue areas selected for maiysk were: (1) special education; (2) teachen and the AnDsaish;(3)~nder~aritpnaimmrhe~~system,and;(4)tbe treatment of religion in Canada's public school curriculum. The findings from the case studies in Part 11 of the dissertation suggest that the Chmter's impact has led to major changes in the field of public education -- changes which have both contributed to, and are representative of, a very substantial alteration or transformation of Canada's legal culture. For example, the case studies revealed that following the adoption of the Charter, members of the legal profession and citizens tended to have a much higher level of rights consciousness than before 1982. Thus, compared to the period before the patriation of the constitution, specific rights were more readily identified by Iitigants in the legal process (e.g., we have a \"right\" to have our special needs child integrated in our neighbourhood school; to teach in public schools even though we are infected with the AIDS virus; to allow girls to play on boys' sports teams; to exercise or not exercise certain religious practices in the schools, etc.) in terms of both explicit Charter cases and human rights cases. Moreover, in dl four cases discwsed, ground-breaking legal cUnges were launched by litigants in order to enforce newly perceived rights, and courts also re.ca@d the rights of Iitigaats to a far greater extent than before 1%2. As a result of a more assertive posture on the part of Canadian courts, and the Supreme Court of Canada in particular after 19a the emergence of a body of cases, or what might be termed a \"rights jurispnidenoe* in the area of public education, mt to mention other areas of Canadian public policy could be discerned As litigants became more active: in enforcing their rights through tk judicial system, aad the ccwts respobded by expanding education-related rigtrts, new legislation was also erracted by the fdral pg;rtiament and p'oviacial assemblies to address Chancr-related righs (e.g., new legislation governing integration of children with disabilities new statutory treatment of religious exercises, etc.). Within the school system itself, new policies and practices recognizing student and employee rights were also adopted. The separate analysis of each of the four public education issue areas in Section II of the dissertation provide strong inferential evidence that profound changes were underway in Canada's Iegal culture during the first decade of the constitution's existence. The area of special education provided a particularly striking case of Chmter-inspired change and the transformation of the legal culture. For example, during the 198& and early 1990s Canadian parents and interest groups became active in utilizing the judicial system as a vehicle to advance their expectations and claims regarding their children's equality rights, and also in which to chaIlenge governmental decisions that were seen to limit those rights. Thus, almost immediately foL1crwing the adoption of the Charter, parents and interest groups supporting the \"right\" of disabled children to be integrated in regular classrooms, took steps to initiate Chiuter challenges and buman rights cases in order to enforce this right, In a marked departwe from tbe prexhotter tread of judicial deference to legislative proorisions atad local school bawd policies, tbe courts assumed a rmch more activist role in recqpking d expading the education-related constitutional rights of special needs ChilQea- As ctiscusscd in Cbapr 3 with respa to the case of Bridsh Columbia, the post- Chaw tread Oacourts ad human rigbts m\"bwnals to strike down pdicks and practices that were stcn to dkmiminate against children with Mties, and also the emergence of influential intcrcsr- pumps cxlmmitted to the expsim of stirdent rights, ~~to~ona~eindusionarynrodtlofeQrcationforrrll~cn, regardless of disability. Thus after 1982, statutory entitlements and local school board policies became oriented toward the \"rights\" or needs of the \"individual learner\" to appropriate educational opportunities. Advocacy relating to the rights of AIDS-infected teachers to continue teaching in the Canadian public school system also revealed an expansion of rights consciousness in Canada. Thus, Canadian teachers with AIDS - in large part inspired by successful AIDS-related litigation in the United States and in other sectors of Canadian life (e.g., the airline industry) - initiated claims maintaining that their particular \"disability\" or \"handicapn should not disentitle them from the right to continue teaching in the public school system. Interestingly, and in contrast to the area of special education, AIDS litigants concerned about rights tended to utiiize provincial human rights legislation and collective agreement grievance provisions when advancing their claims rather through Charter-based litigation. Because the Chmter's equaIity prsvisions were not available to AIDS litigants in the early 1980s, and once they were adable after 1985, the fact that Charter litigation was both time- coz~suming and expensive* were factors which appeared to steer citizens toward haman rights legislation and workplace contraas as the most realistic and efficient avenues far seeking legal recourse. Despite the fact tbat tbe Cher was not the preferred legal vehicle for advancing ASDSrekrcd &ms, &ere b a strong inferemx AZDS Wpm si@caatty For uramplc, a~~inChaptes4~fdkrwiogtht~oau~arad~eSmith~inNwa ~udotbtrcrsa~araidctbceduertioll~dniag,Cladto~oducption policies were developed which recognized the legitimate employment \"rights\" of employees infected with the AIDS vim. These policies encouraged (apparently successfully in view of the small number of Canadian education-related AIDS human rights cases), local school boards to treat AIDS as a constitutionally protected disability. Moreover, since the spate of pt-Charter AIDS cases in both the Canadian public education setting and other sectors, many provinces and the federal government have amended their human rights legislation ta explicitiy provide protection to citizens of Canada who might be clsmmm . .. ted against on the his of *sexual orientation.\" The area of gender equality constituted another important area of expanding rights consciousness and the transformation of Canada's legal culture. Drawing on three areas of Chmrer-inspired legal developments relating to gender equity issues in the Canadian public ducation system, the discussion in Chapter 5 demonstrated the potential impact of gender- related rights consciousness on the legal culture. Thus, Chapter 5 discussed how litigants attempted to make inroads into genderically discriminatory policies and practices in the field of education by: (1) explicitly utilizing the Charter (e.g., challenging the segregation of warraen teachers within a professional association); (2) advanciog new rights claims utilizing hum rights legislation and rights arbitration (e.& the right not to be denied employment opplnunitio on thc basis of sex), and; (3) lobbying for legislative changes (e.g, pay equity legiskation), A&hq$ by the early 19% tbe Chmts had still not resulted in what could be mtcly termed a \"sd revolution\" within the public education system, the initial cepa;c* disagscd obcrvc, tdm togclbtr with several other Charta-laspircd developments in arrsr,dCarrPrtian~~~~uiQreducation,suggFsttdtbat&~inthe educational area would probably be forthcoming over the next several decades. Thus, as the cases in various areas of Canadian society discussed in Chapter 5 revealed, the adoption of the Ch~er and the new constitutional emphasis on genderic rights after 1982, resulted in a number of positive developments for women, e.g., the right to secure an abortion, the right to economic benefits during pregnancy, the right to equal pay for work of equal value, and the right to have sexual harassment treated as sexual discrimination. The expansion of rights consciousness in the area of gender equity can also be traced to vigourous efforts at change by women's groups in the legal profession itself. In addition to giving gender equity rights greater visibiliry in Canadian society through various information campaigns, groups representing women lawyers have followed two special strategies to achieve their goals: (1) sensitizing future and practising members of the legal profession, and also judges, to gender rights; and (2) career advancement of women within the legal profession and judiciary. By 1993, impressive progress had been made in both areas, although such strategies were long-term efforts that would probably take several decades to yield a fundamental change in the internal legal culture. For example, by 1992 (Table 7.1 and 72) only approximately 10% of all Canadian judges were women. The Supreme Court of Canada, where in 19a2 there were two women members out of nine justices, had made the kt relative progress in this regard. The contentious issue of addressing religious beliefs in tk public school curriculum also revealed important changes in rights consciousness and legal culture. Prior to lW, pmvkes with otherwise secular public school systems prwided that Christian-based ~tligious exercises were statutorily required as a c0mpu)sory and integral component of the Table 7.1 Total Super- Grand Total No. (%) Judges numaries Total of Women Judges in Office Supreme Court 9 0 9 Federal Court Appeal Division 10 1 Trial Division 11 2 Tax Court of Canada 19 3 Court of Appeal, Queen's Bench, Superior Court and Trial Division in Provinces and Territories 709 139 Source: Calculated on the basis of data provided in Appendix A and B of G& Eqvnliry in the Canadian Justrce Sysfmc Bockgmud Papers, Prepared by the Federd/Rovincial/Temtorial Working Group of Attomey-General Officials on Gender Equality in the Justice System, (April 1992).

Parents and students in the pre-Chmter period did not legally challenge such compulsory religious exercises, typically exhibiting the deferential attitude toward government and school officials that was characteristic in the pre-Charter period. However, following the post-charter rulings by the Supreme Court of Canada which endorsed the \"centrality\" of the constitution's fundamental guarantees of religious freedoms, protests by parents, alternatively espousing either a secular public school cumculum or a religious- inspired curriculum, generated several interesting court cases and rights claims. For example, as discussed in Chapter 6 of the dissertation, Ontario parents who pursued two separate challenges to the Ontario Court of Appeal established that compulsory school prayer, religious exercises opening the school day, and the indoctrination of any religion through the public school Curiculum, were all contrary to the Chmter's guarantee of freedom of religion and conscience. Thus, for the first time since Confederation, and in a striking example of how the Charter was affecting Canadian society, the teaching of religious beliefs was deemed by the courts to be constitutionally inappropriate as part of the public school curriculum The important Ontario cases had a ripple effect on parents, courts and legislatures throughout the country, and by the early 19% vbdy all provincial education legislation mandated the separation of religion from the Canadian public education cumculum. In PO interesting example of the oomplex competing rights present in liberal dmomtder the qmmioa of rights on the pan of litigants seeking to seadark che public schd system fostered a bactlarh in the curriculum was disniminatory and unconstiturioml. Thus, it was argued, that a public school curriculum which was devoid of Christian or other established rciigious values, ad which advocated the \"religion\" of secular humanism (including the notion of evolution) constituted an infringement of the righu of children who sought (or whose parents sought) an explicitly Christian or traditional religious education, 11, THE CHARTER AMD PUBLIC EDUCATION: BEYOND THE FIRST DECADE The rrase studies of sefected issue areas in public education revealed striking changes in Canadds legal culture during the post-CMer period. By 1993, just over a decadc after the pauiation of the constitution, rights consciousness in Canada had clearly reached a relatively high level of crystatlization. Indecd, one could reasonably oonciudc that rights conscioulrr~ess had become a substantial elemem or compooent of rhc: Canadian legal culture- One significant indicator of Canada's changing legal culture which emerged from the dissenatlan's qualitative case sbdy ardyk of eduation-relatad issues was tbe role of the !kipreme Court of Canabda- Statistid compilations of recent Charter cases of judicial decision-making in Caneda's 1992 of decided by the c- sqmnc 43mfe.r Decisions as a Percentage Decisions (1981-1989) Same: Mapd Morton Pcrtr H. Russell, The Supreme Caut d car)^ Fint Oac Hundred Statistical Hdl Law fd, VoL 3& No, 1 (Spring 19921, p. 5. In the field of public education, evidence drawn born the trend analyses and the preceding case studies indicates that the Chmrer made a very significant impact from 1982 to 1993. Indeed, following the Supreme Court of Canada's first C;ltarier judge in the 1984 Skapinker case, it became clear that the courts would use the new constitution to review and strike down unconstitutiod federal and provincial legislation. The adoption of the Cham, the Supreme Court of Canada bluntly asserted in 1985, \"has sent a clear mcs~agc to the cwm that the restdive attitude which at one time characterized their approach to the CorrPdimt Bill of R@ls ought to be reexaminedd As detailed in the dissertation's case studies, the more activist exercise of judicial review by the courts after 19$2 resulted in several constitutioaal decisions ievalidathg education legislation which conflicted with constitutional guaranfees of rights and freedoms Thus, in the decade after 1982 an expanding body of Clrmninspired sfhool law rights jurisprudence bad emerged? By the tall of 1993, bowever* tbe Supreme Court of Canada bad stilt not definitively ruled whether the Chmer generally applied to local school boards, and it was not clear to what extent the policies and practices of school officiais would ultimately be subject to future challenges based upon Chmer-specified rights. The crux of the issue in this regard was whether school boards could be said to fall within the scope of \"government,\" referred to in Section 32(1) of the constitution and were therefore subject to Charter interpretation. Although during the late 1- and early 1m some commentators concluded that the constitution did apply to school boards,' the courts exhibited less consensus on this question. Thus, in the Charfer cases that have challenged school board actions some judges have suggested that the Chmter does apply to schooi boards? In other cases, courts have mled that a specific school board action offended the Chmter, but dccfimd to rule an the question of whether tbe CMer generally applied to all school bard In yet See, for exampie, Mr. htia Zuker's, 7k Legal 6. Sily Wi Smith bas cowluded that recent judicial rulings by the weme Court of Canada indicate that pdw and polides of xbool boards will be considered sufficiently governmental to attract Charrer review \"Rights aad Freedoms in Education: Tbe Application of Charter to Public School hw ~~ Law JcrPYnal, VV. 4 (1993), 107-161, other cases, judges have offered mixed decisions concerning this jurisdictional issue,\" while others have suggested that the Charier does nut apply to school boards.\" By 1993, the applicability of human right. legislation to local school boards was somewhat clearer. Thus, although prior to tbe entrenchment of the Charter, most human rights tribunals had concluded that schools were not \"a service or facility customarily available to the public,\" and that human rights legislation could not therefore be used to Wage polieies uld actions by school 0ffieial4~~ by tbe mid198Q and early 19% this trend appeared to have been revemd with several important cases establishing that schools indced were subject to provimial human rights legislatioa\" This issue, hwver, will ah jwisdictional issue. Tbw the judge bearing the case remarked (at p. 708) concerning the be of whether the Chmter applied to xbl bawds: \"I do not find it ncoessary to decide tbk difficult issue.\" not be definitively determined until the matter is decided by tbe Supreme Court of Canada. Until the question of the werd applicability of the Charter and other rights instruments to local school boards is resohred. the growing body of rights oriented jurisprudence wiH likely continue to influence Canadian education in an incremental manner. Constitutional adljudication is a future-oriented and dynamic process. Indeed, in one of its early Cher decisions, the Supreme Court of Canada underlined the importance of judicial flexibility in its Chamr decision-making: The task of expounding a mnsti:ution is crucially different &om that of construing a statute. A statutc defines present rigbts and obligations It is easily enacted and as easiiy repealed. A constitution, by coouast, is drafted with an eye to the future. I& function is to provide a continuing framework for the legitimate exercise of governmental power and when joined by a Bill or a Cbancr of righy for the unremitting proteaion of individuai tights and liberties Onot enacted, its provisions atmrot easily be repealed or 9mendtd. It must, therefore, be ct.ipbk of growth ad kiopment over time to meet ncw wchk political aad histosical realities ohen unimagined by its framers. Tbe judiciary is the guardian of tbe Cumtitution and ELIUS& in interpreting its ptovis'imy bear these coddenuionr in mind. Proftssor Paul Freud Amtricga otwns 'not to red ttEe provisions of the Constitution lik a last will aad testament lest it kwme one!.** et BL v- Pd &mi in the second decade of the Chart& life there are likely tcr be some completeb new areas of rights assertion and rights jurisprudence &at develop out of challenges to public education policies and practices. For example, by 1993 new education- related Charier cases included a student's constitutional challenge (based on the CherS guarantee of freedom of expression) to disciplinary action imposed by school officials after the student continued to sing a %armed\" song about safe sex;\" a constitutionid cchaenge initiated by a teachers' don agab the Ontario government wbich abgd that the prmi~*s pay freeze legislation violated the teachers' guarantee of freedom of aswckttio~'' and comtitutional challenges by Quebec school boards who opposed the Quebec government's plan to rtorganize the province's school districts along linguistic as oppmd to denominational lidg The cxpadd role of a rightmriented jurisprudence in ttK: field of education and other scaofs of society in Canada was not welcomed uncritically by all Canadians. While rk enhanct.d role of the Supreme Court of Canrada, and the impact of the Chmter on Canada dearly Vansfo- Csllgdiaa I@ development after 1% such changes did not \"'lhC QIU( vrs to k louachd in the summr of 1993. Tammo Slrr, July 23, 1993. p, Ala, affect all areas of Canadian -ety in a uniform or unidirectional manner.\" Thus, in some cases, Charrer-inspired changes in various sectors of educational policy and practice engendered considerable coo~meny and even strong couuter-trends. Some observers felt, for example, that the new rights consciousness reflected the growing *Americanizationw of Canadian law and society, a trend that was both negative in its legal and political impiications for Canadians, and dso antithetical to Canada's traditions aad needs.' Far exampie, in a N93 book Lawrence Manin expressed many of these rmtions abt the influence of American law on Canadian society when he argued tbat the Charter was having a detrimental decentralizing impact on Canada by fostering interest grwps and citizens who had kame imbued with an un-Canadian sense of individualism2' Such criticism was seen to a~aXirm trends which had been anticipated by critics of the Trudeau-inspired Charter \"Some legal scholars have argued, for example, that judicial review under the Chutiw is essentially antidemocratic. For a discussion of this debate sec Andrew Petter and Allan C. Hut- \"Rights in Conflia: The Dilemma of Charter Legitimscy,\" U. of&irish Cdimbk Law Vol, 23, No. 2 (1989), pp, 531-548.

Other Canadian observers, however, took issue with such criticism arguing that the Charier was having a pitiwe centralizing, and indeed nationalizing influence on Canadian society by giving rise to a crossCanada sense of national citizenshipa that was distinct from local and regional identities? This was essentially the same argument that Prime Minister Trudeau had made during the ctrllstitutional debates which fed to the adoption of the Charter (see Chapter 2). Indec& according to the latter argument, it is the more *callectivist* or grouponenred impulses in Canadian political culture which have spawned \"destructive* pressure group activities, such as the efforts to entrench a hierarchy of group rigbts in the constitution. or which seek special privileges for spdfic groups. Moreover, according to such defenders of the Canadian Ciuvtet of R&hts and Freedomr, tbe new RighiJ, does aot institutionalize or t-r a conflict between state regulation and individual Some revealing comments by Chief Justice Lamer tend to suppan tbe argument that an emphasis on rights, . as well as a more activist role for the Supreme Court and reference to American case law \" An andpis of the CWs 'uatiowbuilding* potential and FL 7VatiohcWlilding aod the Cairn and C+ Willisms (&X C- Tocomo Press, 1W), pp. 133-182 does not necessarily constitute the wholesale Americanization of Canadian legal culture: ... the Charter has changed our job descriptions. Most judges were trained in the law prior to ... the Charter, so we were trained, not to judge laws, but to apply them .... And so many of us ... had to adapt to this new role .... We've had to change our libraries, and start reading a lot of American stuff that we weren't used to, and a lot of European stuff. ... It would be ridiculaus if we wanted to reinvent the wheel here (in Canada]. Though we don't necessarily have to follow American jurispr~dence.~ Another problem which sparked controversy in Canad2 after 1982 was the issue of whether greater concern with equality rights under the revamped constitutional framework benefitted all Canadians as individuals -- as promoters of the Chmter often proclaim -- or have been to the special benefit of certain socalled \"disadvantaged groups\" in ~anada.\" Debate concerning this issue came to the fore in mid-1993 after the Federal Court of Appeal unanimously rejected a Charter challenge which claimed that certain provisions of ?he.

A5, couples.27 in ruling that the differential treatment of married couples by the Income Tm An was not discriminatory, the Federal Court ruled that simply showing differential treatment is not enough to prove a discrimination under Section 15 of the Charter. Rather, the court concluded, that in order not to \"trivialize\" the Charter, individuals must show that they belong to a group that has traditionally suffered discrimination, or failing that, demonstrate that there was clear prejudice against them because of their membership in a particular group. Thus according to the Court of Appeal, because married couples do not belong to a disadvantaged group, they therefore cannot avail themselves of constitutional remedies for discriminatory treatment. In this vein the court reasoned: ... it cannot be said that married persons have been socially, politidly or historically disadvantaged in Canada...Rather members of our society who are married may well have experienced some privilege and advantage as a result of their status. Married people are not a discrete and insular minority, nor are they an independently disadvantaged group.\" In contrast to the Charter's equality guarantees which provide that \"every individual\" is equal before and under the law and has equal protection and benefit of the law without discrimination, this ruling effectively concluded that only \"disadvantaged groups\" are subject to the coIIstitution's anti-dtsmmm . *. tion protection. Such a conclusion was justifiable, according to Mr. Justice Linden, because: \"Advantaged groups have more power in our society; accordin&, it is assumed that distinctions that dhdvantage them are not - v. Chda [l993], F.C.J. No. 661, Unreported, July 6, 1993. ' -, p. 76. discriminatory, unless there is clear evidence of prejudice or stereotyping.\"\" Raising the controversial issue of whether the constitutional equality provisions should be interpreted to protect individual rights, or whether Section 15 is in fact an \"affirmative action\" guarantee designed to remedy historically disadvantaged groups, the Schachtschneider decision focused attention on the complex and often competing interests of individuals and groups in Canadian society. How the balance between group rights and individual rights will eventually play out in Canada's emerging rights jurisprudence remains a very open question at the end of 1993.~ What is more apparent, however, is that constitutional change in Canada in the 1980s and early 1990s has already profoundly altered Canadian legal development, legal debate, and legal culture. Thus, the controversy regarding group versus individual equality rights, in and of itself provides confirmation that rights have assumed a much higher profile in the Canadian legal culture. Prior to 1982, a debate regarding such equality rights would not have engendered much controversy because supportive popular assumptions and cultural attitudes toward rights, and the implementation of rights, were not a prime dimension of Canadian legal culture. The important trends dixussed in this dissertation, as wen as the various controversies and open questions concerning Canadian legal: development during the early *Aim group ad individual rights need m mcaady be thought of as mutually adwive. For exampk, while \"groupa rights are assigned to women as a *poup,\" as the Sctuechtsdvreider ox illustrates, SZI& group rigbu an \"outgrowth of expr- indivictualism.* For a discadon of this concept ste, for example, Lawrence F:ricdmPs 'The Conrep of Self in Legal Culture,\" 38, No. 4 (I=), pp. 517-533. 19905 -- with respect to Canadian public education and other areas of Canadian society -- suggest a legal culture that has already undergone fundamental changes, but which remains in transition. Canadian legal culture has not become, and most likely will not became, a mirror image of the American legal culture, but rather after 1982 was assuming its own character and dynamic. This new Canadian constitutional identity reflected a sharp contrast with the legal system that existed d iring the pre-1982 decades of the Canadian confederation. The values and attitudes that constitute a legal culture are not static, but rather are constantly evolving. Many of the new shoots that were planted during the first decade of Choner development by Supreme Court rulings, and aiso through the activity of rights oriented groups, had begun to bl05som by 1993, but would most likely only reach a stage of mature growth during the next half century. Thus, Canadian legal culture had undergone a fundamentat transformation after 1982, but legal development remained an ongoing prclcess. Further interpretation of the Canadian Chmter of R@k Md Freedonts and the development of rights consciousness in the late 20th and early 21st centuries will undoubtedly be a fascinatiag voyage of discovery fur both legal professionals and citizens, and also a journey that is likely to enrich the nature of Camdim &m~cracy. Legal development in the field of pubic education will be an impow fket in the fume growth of a rights orieatcd juriywuck:m thar will require c1w attention and serious analysis.
