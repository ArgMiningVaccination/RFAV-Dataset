But it might not be the sort of discussion you'd expect - we're not talking about different remedies for conditions or anything like that, but rather, I've asked her onto the show to chat about essential oil safety and sustainability. Do you use essential oils? I would expect the majority of those listening to this show do use them to some extent, given how popular they are becoming amongst those people who are interested in natural medicines. There's a lot of awesomeness about essential oils, but there is a lot of people using them that haven't been given the full story about their potential side effects, and how to use them safely. Given that the amount of essential oil poisonings has been increasing each year, and the majority of cases of harm are in those under 15 years of age, I really feel it's important to share the importance of knowing how to use essential oils safely to keep yourself and your children safe. In this episode, I am joined with The Alternative Mumma aka Raine. She is a clinical aromatherapist and student naturopath with a bachelor of environmental science. Raine is passionate about sharing essential oil safety information and is a wealth of knowledge about this. Her Instagram is full of great information about this, so head over to her page after this and check it out.
