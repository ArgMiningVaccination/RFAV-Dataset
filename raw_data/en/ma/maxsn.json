B.E.S.T. is widely used by healthcare practitioners worldwide who practice mind/body healing and recognize that the body is more than the sum of its parts. It is a system of health care that is state of the art in balancing body, mind, memory, and spirit energy fields and enhancing the flow of that energy throughout the entire system. It is a whole-body healing technique. The body reveals its short-circuited neurological patterns due to unresolved subconscious emotional issues, affecting all systems required for health and wholeness. Those patterns can be demonstrated as tight muscles, dysfunctional organs or glands, emotional stress, or depression-type reactions. By accessing areas of the brain through a pressure point type therapy, that is, touching certain points around the head and body in a specific sequence while having you think about certain memory stresses; the body begins to reconnect the circuitry with the brain. Clinical experience has shown that by stimulating these specific pressure points as part of the B.E.S.T. procedure, your body can not only begin to feel better but will begin to repair and rebuild. By taking this approach, you are taking steps to learn to maintain this balance in the days, weeks, and months that follow. The body is electromagnetic. Both electrical fields and magnetic fields affect it. Bio-Energetic work utilizes one or both of these types of energy for healing purposes. This work is done with hands only when applied by a practitioner and does not require using instruments. When used as a self-healing technique, breath work and mental focus training remove blockages from the nervous system and subconscious memory storage. The mind is trained to focus on the effect of stored interference and dissolve it using a variety of energetic bandwidths and conscious breathing exercises. Bio-Energetic treatment creates a natural balancing of nerve function and communication between the Conscious and Subconscious di-visions of the Central Nervous System. It is a gentle, painless, non-force methodology for many conditions often treated with medications and surgeries. It addresses the cause instead of the symptoms exhibited in the individual. Bio-Energetics allows for healing without using drugs, surgery, or other techniques with side effects. It corrects nervous system function that could contribute to other mental, emotional, or physical health conditions that have not yet become symptomatic, preventing the onset altogether. Self-Healing Breath Work and Mental Focus benefits include a regular shift in disposition in the individual toward a self-empowered life experience. Practices can be done while the individual engages in many other daily activities, and once learned, do not require significant time al-lotted separately. Bio-Energetic Synchronization Work Karina Egorov \"I have had 3 BEST sessions so far and in each session I find big progress in my attitude and general well-being. I find that this treatment goes much deeper than the kinesiology work I have had before as it tackles the deepest underlining cause. I can easily let go of the victim mentality I used to struggle with before. I feel confident and prepared, difficult situations don't seem like a big deal anymore. I find solutions instead of feeling overwhelmed and procrastination is not such a problem anymore. Overall my anxiety has almost disappeared and I feel so peaceful, no need to please anyone but me. I often felt confused. I used to have the feeling of excitement with anxiety, but now I just feel happy and elated. I am astonished at the massive change within me and could not be more grateful. Thank you, Lida! It's exactly what I've been looking for.\" Grita Kar Lida has worked with me to aid and massively improve a chronic childhood condition. That no one else was able to improve to this extent. Thank you! Tina Maher \"I have had only 3 sessions with Lida so far and I am feeling a lot more positive. I have suffered from depression on and off since I was 14 ( am now in my late 50s) I have tried numerous therapy but nothing seemed to understand me like this one does. I got interested in the therapy from a book and was pleased when I found a local therapist. I had made up my mind that I no longer wanted to live this half-life feeling not good enough and shame that my upbringing had put on me. I was on antidepressants when I went to Lida. The doctor just kept writing me a repeat prescription every 3moths and never asked me to the surgery to check how I was. I am also reading Dr. Sue Morter's book and doing the exercises which is helping a lot. I would recommend anyone to try it. I know it is not a quick fix and I am not where I want to be at the end but I am certainly heading in the right direction. Lida is a lovely warm lady who I felt at ease with as soon as I met her which is what I was looking for in a therapist. I have had too many in the past that I did not feel comfortable with.\" Kerryn Fields I took my 2yr old with severe separation anxiety, frequent nightmares, and problems sleeping properly due to enlarged adenoids and tonsils to see Lida for kinesiology, ahead of an operation to remove the adenoids and tonsils, and which I had pretty bad anxiety about. After seeing Lida once, my son has blossomed and seems to be so much lighter and happier and his separation anxiety has dropped from a 11/10 to about a 3/10!!!!! His sleeping has improved HUGELY too and he hardly has nightmares anymore. I then continued to see Lida for her spiritual B.E.S.T techniques and without going into lots of detail, I have had some incredible shifts in my energy, thinking, and perspectives and have released so many blockages that have been holding me back in achieving goals I have for myself. I cannot recommend Lida enough and have recommended her services to a few friends as I think she's great at what she does.\" O & K Property Works \"I have struggled with terrible back pain for many years and have tried everything to stop the pain. I decided to also try and see Lida for B.E.S.T sessions and she has helped me so much, I was even surprised. I have seen Lida 4 times now, once every 3 weeks. And the pain has reduced by about 60%. I have also noticed an improvement in my emotional well-being and stability. I'm looking forward to my next session. Lida is a very nice person and always very pleasant and accommodating.\" Sheilagh Noble "}
