Newer information about local AR is reviewed. Cough is emphasized as a common symptom in bothAR and NAR. Food allergy testing is not recommended in theroutine evaluation of rhinitis. Intranasal corticosteroids (INCS) remain the preferred monotherapy for persistent AR, but additional studies support the additive benet of combinationtreatment with INCS and intranasal antihistamines AR and NAR. Either intranasal antihistamines or INCS may be offered as rst-line monotherapy for NAR. Montelukast shouldonly be used for AR if there has been an inadequate response or intolerance to alternative therapies. Depot parenteral corticosteroids are not recommended for treatment of AR dueto potential risks. While intranasal decongestants generally should be limited to short-term use to prevent rebound congestion, in limited circumstances, patients receivingregimens that include an INCS may be offered, in addition, anintranasal decongestant for up to 4 weeks.

Keynew and updated recommendations are emphasized ( Table I ). INTRODUCTION The diagnosis of rhinitis is suggested by the presence of 1 or more of the following symptoms: nasal congestion, rhinorrhea(anterior and posterior), sneezing, and itching. 1Rhinitis can be classied by pathogenic mechanisms, as allergic or nonallergic, and differentiated from conditions that have overlapping symptoms of rhinitis. Rhinitis phenotypes Although the term rhinitis connotes inflammation, and allergic rhinitis (AR) and some types nonallergic rhinitis (NAR) syndrome [NARES], vasomotor rhinitis (VMR) or atrophic rhinitis of the nasal mucosa. Rhinitisfrequently is accompanied by symptoms involving the eyes, ears, and throat. Conditions that have overlapping symptoms with rhinitis include rhinosinusitis with and without nasal polyps,cerebrospinal fluid dyskinesia and congenital anomalies, deviated septum, and pharyngonasal reflux. Recognition ofwhether a patient has AR or NAR or another mimicking condition is important because management will differ. AR affects up to 60 million people in the United States annually, can have a major impact on quality of life (QOL), andposes a substantial economic burden on society. It also is often associated with and can potentially impact asthma, allergic conjunctivitis, rhinosinusitis, and sleep disturbances. Prevalence Self-reported rates of AR are 10% to 30% of adults and as many as 40% of children in the United States.2In recent surveys that required a physician-conrmed diagnosis of AR, the prevalence rates were 14% of US adults and 13% of US children.3,4Canadian data support an even higher prevalence of up to 20% of the pop-ulation having physician-diagnosed AR. 5Chronic NAR has been estimated to affect 17% to 52% of adults while up to 34% of pa- tients with rhinitis in the United States may have a combination of AR and NAR, often referred to as ''mixed rhinitis.''6-10 QOL in rhinitis Issues of QOL somnolence irritability; depression; impair-ment of physical social functioning; and attention, learning, and memory decits. Thirty-ve percent to 50% of adults reported that nasal allergies have at least a moderate effect on their dailylife. 3Sleep disturbances associated with rhinitis include difculty falling asleep, staying asleep, and awakening refreshed. Nearly 1 in 4 of adult US respondents report they are unable to sleep or are Reprints: Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters Liaison : Rebecca Brandt (American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology, 555 E.

Resolving conflict of interest: The JTFPP is committed to ensuring that all guidelines are based on the best scientic evidence at the time of publication, and that such evidenceis free of commercial bias to the greatest extent possible. Before conrming theselection of the work group chairperson and members, the JTFPP discusses andresolves all relevant potential conflicts of interest (COIs) of each work group member.The JTFPP recognizes that experts in a eld are likely to have interests that could come into conflict with the development of a completely unbiased and objective guideline. Therefore, a process has been developed to acknowledge potential COIs when makingspecic recommendations. To preserve the greatest transparency regarding potentialCOIs, all members of the JTFPP and work group complete a COI form prior to thedevelopment of each document and again prior to the guideline submission forpublication. During the review process there are additional measures to avoid bias. At the work group level, all the recommendations and discussion sections are reviewed by all work group members to ensure that content is appropriate and without apparent bias. If anyrecommendation or section is deemed to have apparent bias, it is appropriately revised,without the section author's involvement, in an attempt to remove potential bias. Inaddition, the entire document is also reviewed by the JTFPP and any apparent bias isacknowledged and removed at that level. For each and every recommendation, a vote is required by the work group and JTFPP, and any member with any perceived COI is recused from that vote (and so explained in the document). Any dissenting votes thatcannot be resolved are described and explained in the document. In a nal stage of review, the practice parameter is sent to invited expert reviewers for review, selected by the AAAAI and the ACAAI. The document is also posted on theAAAAI and ACAAI websites for general membership and the public-at-large toreview and offer comment. All reviewers must provide statements of potential COIs. Although the JTFPP has the nal responsibility for the content of the documents submitted for publication, each reviewer's comments will be discussed and reviewerswill receive written responses to comments when appropriate.

' The medical environment israpidly changing, and not all recommendations will be appropriate or applicable to allpatients and may change over time. Because this document incorporates the efforts ofmany participants, no single individual, including members serving on the JTFPP, isauthorized to provide an ofcial AAAAI or ACAAI interpretation of this guideline. Any request for information or interpretation of this practice parameter by the AAAAI or ACAAI should be directed to the executive ofces of the AAAAI and the ACAAI.Practice parameters and guidelines are not designed for use by the pharmaceuticalindustry in drug development or promotion. The JTFPP understands that the cost ofdiagnostic tests and therapeutic interventions is an important concern that mayappropriately influence the evaluation and treatment selected for a given patient. The JTFPP recognizes that the emphasis of our primary recommendations regarding a medication may vary, for example, depending on third-party payer issues and productpatent expiration dates. However, because a given test or a therapeutic intervention'scost is so widely variable, and there is a relative paucity of pharmacoeconomic data, theJTFPP is not always able to consider cost when formulating recommendations. Inextraordinary circumstances, when the cost benet of an intervention is prohibitive assupported by pharmacoeconomic data, commentary may be provided.

Up to 10% ofworkers reported absenteeism because of their nasal allergies, and up to 25% reported presenteeism, with an estimated 23% to 33% decrease in productivity on days when allergies were at theirworst compared with days when the respondent experienced no symptoms. 3Increased symptom severity, decreased sleep quality and quantity, adverse effects on mental function, and treatmentwith soporic antihistamines negatively impact work productivi- ty. 17Appropriate therapy can substantially reduce both societal and employer costs. Lack of treatment, undertreatment, or nonad-herence to treatment have been shown to increase direct and indi- rect costs. 18AR can, by itself, introduce signicant inattention, impairment of cognition, and decreased daytime schoolperformance. 19 AR, notably present in about 75% to 80% of all patients with asthma and in nearly 100% with allergic asthma, is associated with increased asthma-related hospitalizations and higher totalannual medical costs.Classication of AR: severity, frequency, and environmental exposure Assessment of rhinitis by severity, frequency, and exposure can assist the clinician in developing the most appropriate treatment strategies for an individual patient. Mild rhinitis severity is present when symptoms are not interfering with QOL such asimpairment of daily activities, work or school performance,leisure activities, and sleep. Moderate/severe rhinitis is present when symptoms are troublesome or there is negative impact on any of these QOL parameters. 1,20Other groups have proposed a division into mild, moderate, and severe,21but as this division does not clearly translate into a change in therapy, the most accepted division is still the dual one, which is also used in themajority of clinical trials. Symptom frequency has been divided by some into intermittent (<4 days/week or <4 consecutive has some limitations; for example, a patient who has symptoms 3 days/week year-round would be classied as ''inter-mittent'' although they might more closely resemble a ''persis-tent'' patient. The preceding denitions of severity and frequency may be applied to AR, NAR, or mixed rhinitis (when both allergic andnonallergic components contribute to rhinitis symptoms). AR may also be classied by the temporal pattern of environmental exposure to a triggering allergen: seasonal (Inter-national Classication of Diseases, allergen exposures not normally encoun-tered in the patient's environment, such as visiting a home with pets. 1AR from animals (J30.81) therefore may be perennial with ongoing exposure, or occur only with episodic exposure. In the United States, AR has traditionally been viewed as either seasonal (SAR) or perennial (PAR), and it is this classication system that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)23uses when approving new medications for AR. The reality is that aTABLE I. What is new or newly emphasized in Rhinitis 2020? Four new algorithms based on a combination of evidence and expert opinion can guide the clinician in the treatment of intermittent and persistent AR an d NAR. New tables assist in making (1) the differential diagnosis for rhinitis based on patient history and (2) the diagnosis and treatment for rhinitis-ass ociated conditions or conditions that mimic rhinitis. Cough is emphasized as a common symptom present in both AR and NAR.New information is presented about LAR, possibly present in up to 25% of patients with rhinitis, and its response to both SCIT and SLIT, although more research is needed. We recommend that food allergy testing not be performed in the routine evaluation of possible AR (Recommendation 4). We recommend that the oral LTRA montelukast should only be used for AR in patients who have an inadequate response or intolerance to alternative therapies. Serious neuropsychiatric events that may include suicidal thoughts or actions have been reported in patients taking montelukast (Receommendation 7). Either INAH or INCS may be offered as rst-line monotherapy for NAR (Recommendations 12, 32). Since the 2008 rhinitis update, additional studies support the use of combination INCS and INAH in AR and NAR (Recommendations 22-24). Oral decongestants should be avoided during the rst trimester of pregnancy (Recommendation 19).Additional information is presented as to why rst-generation antihistamines should not be used in AR, especially on a chronic basis, due to potentia l sedation, performance impairment, poor sleep quality, anticholinergic-medicated symptoms, and increased risk of dementia (Receommendation 6). We continue to suggest that the use of intranasal decongestants generally be limited to short-term use to prevent rebound congestion that may occur wi th longer use. However, in limited circumstances discussed in the document, patients on regimens that include an INCS may be offered combination therap y with addition of an intranasal decongestant for up to 4 wk (Receommendations 16, 26). SCIT and SLIT tablets are both effective for the treatment of AR and may help prevent and/or treat allergic asthma (Receommendation 34). Neither acupuncture nor herbal medications have adequate studies to support a recommendation to use them in the treatment of AR (Receommendations 36 , 37).J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL OCTOBER 2020724DYKEWICZ ET ALpatient may have both SAR and PAR, SAR or PAR with NAR (In- ternational Classication of Diseases, 10th Revision, J30 ''vaso- motor and allergic rhinitis''), intermittent symptoms with PAR, or persistent symptoms with SAR. It is also recognized that thedistinction between SAR and PAR has limitations; in different cli- matic regions, the same aeroallergen can be either seasonal or perennial. Nonetheless, the recognition that an individual hasSAR and is allergic to particular pollen allergens of known sea-sonality in a region may help guide administration of medications concurrent with (or in anticipation of) that dened seasonal expo- sure. That said, one must be mindful that nasal inflammation andthereby need for treatment may persist for weeks after a pollen season is over. The majority of patients are polysensitized to both pollens and perennial allergens. In a population of 6000 pa-tients with AR, it was shown that 55% of patients with seasonal symptoms and 45% of those with perennial symptoms had inter- mittent AR; thus, the SAR-PAR classication is independent fromthe intermittent-persistent one. 24Since then, numerous studies have duplicated these ndings in other regions.25,26 Local AR In local allergic rhinitis (LAR), also referred to as entopy, there is (1) a clinical history of perennial and/or seasonal symptomsfollowing allergen exposure, with (2) negative skin prick tests (and intradermal tests, when performed) and absence of serum- specic IgE (sIgE) antibodies but (3) a positive nasal allergenprovocation test (NAPT) to aeroallergens. 27-30 While a major study center in Europe has contributed the bulk of the research on LAR as discussed above, additional smallstudies from Australia, 31Sweden,32Egypt,33and China34,35have supported their ndings. There have been limited US studies, not all conrming these ndings.36,37 A dual (immediate and late) response to NAPT had been noted in 37% to 70% of LAR.38,39Although it would be expected that local sIgE would be detected in all patients with NAPT challenge-diagnosed LAR, some studies of LAR from pollensdetect local sIgE in as few as 30% of patients. 39,40When present in patients with SAR, an increase in nasal sIgE is noted both dur- ing NAPT challenge and during pollen season.40Likewise, in 1 dust mite LAR study of patients who had a positive NAPT-dust mite challenge, only 22% had nasal sIgE to dust mites.38 A recent method of detecting nasal sIgE by the direct application of the solid phase of a commercial ImmunoCAP test showed asensitivity of 43% and high specicity and offers promise for future clinical use. 41Making the diagnosis can be challenging given the current low sensitivity of assays for the local sIgE andthe need to conduct an in-ofce NAPT procedure. 42,43Studies have suggested that the basophil activation test might serve as a surrogate marker of LAR, although currently this is availableonly as a research tool .It has been shown that using the basophil activation test with Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (DP) extract and olive tree identies 50% to 66%, respectively, of pa-tients with NAPT-established LAR with a specicity of 93% and showing identical specicity for both LAR and AR. 44 In some studies, using NAPT, up to 26% of all patients with rhinitis and up to 100% of patients with NAR haveLAR. 31,32,35,36,45-48In a population-based observational study that categorized all patients with rhinitis, over 25% and 63% were diagnosed to have LAR and AR, respectively, indicatingthat <12% had other types of NAR. 49The coexistence of dualperennial LAR and SAR (skin prick test-positive) has also been described.50,51However, prevalence rates of LAR in China have been reported to be much lower (eg, 7.7%).52LAR is reported to be more prevalent in women, to be associated with a family his-tory of atopy equal to or greater than that of AR, and to have a mean onset of 21 years; however, LAR may start in childhood 36% of the time. 49,53,54Local occupational rhinitis, diagnosed by nasal provocation studies, should be considered in workerswith a convincing history but with negative immunological tests. 55 The most frequently reported symptoms in patients with LAR are watery rhinorrhea, sneezing and itching, compared with congestion and mucoid rhinorrhea for patients with NAR.49,56 While most patients with LAR are monosensitized, most commonly to dust mite, up to 37% are polysensitized to seasonal and/or perennial allergens.46,49,57Of particular interest is a signif- icantly lower incidence (2.7%) of animal dander sensitization inpatients with LAR compared with in patients with AR (31%). 49 The majority of adult patients with LAR have moderate/severe, persistent, and perennial symptoms, with common comorbidities of conjunctivitis (50%-65%) and asthma (18%-47%). Thesestudies show that the severity of LAR and associated comorbid- ities increase with disease duration. 39,49,58-60 The mainstay of current LAR treatment has consisted of avoidance and pharmacotherapy. However, recent well- controlled trials suggest that if the specic triggering allergen can be accurately identied, subcutaneous allergy immuno-therapy (SCIT) or sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) might be a reasonable consideration. SCIT has been successfully used to treat dust mite-, grass-, and birch-induced LAR in 2 differentEuropean centers. 40,60-62A randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled (DBPC) parallel group study demonstrated that SCIT with DP in patients with LAR who are DP-sensitized produced signicant improvement with reduction in total symptom score(47%), reduction in total medication scores (51%), and reduced responses to NAPT-DP (with total suppression in 50% of patients) over a 24-month treatment period. 62Signicant symptom improvement and nasal tolerance to NAPT-DP was noted as early as 6 months into treatment.60A small randomized DBPC 24- month trial of birch SCIT to patients with SAR produced a signif-icant reduction in symptom medication score, a decrease in local sIgE, and an increase in IgG 4levels.40In this study, local sIgE levels signicantly increased during birch season in all patients,but a blunted seasonal increase was noted at 24 months in theactive treatment group. 40An observational study using preseaso- nal grass SCIT demonstrated signicant clinical improvement and increased NAPT nasal tolerance in all patients.61However, in this early study, 40% of the SCIT group developed positive skin prick tests after 6 months of treatment followed by sIgE and sIgG antibodies to grass after 12 months of treatment.61 The same group completed a randomized DBPC study involving 56 patients with LAR to grass, established by either a positive NAPT or nasal sIgE >_0.35 kU/L.63There was signicant improvement in combined symptoms medication score and Rhi-noconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire after 6 months of preseasonal treatment. The effect was sustained during the second year when year-round SCIT was used. There was a signicant IgG 4levels and allergen tolerance with 83% of patients completing at least 6 months of treatment tolerating over 50 times higher concentration of grass pollen duringNAPT challenge, with 56% having a negative challenge. 63InJ ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 146, NUMBER 4DYKEWICZ ET AL 725this controlled study, only 7.4% of the active versus 3% of the control group developed sIgE to grass at the end of year 1, showing that active SCIT treatment is unlikely to be creating sys- temic atopy.63A larger, prospective 10-year cohort study (2005- 2016) of untreated patients with LAR showed a progressive wors- ening of the rhinitis, increased development of asthma, reduced QOL, and loss of allergen tolerance.64While a signicant change was noted after 5 years,53this becomes progressively worse throughout the entire 10 years. The development of systemic atopy was not found to be signicantly greater in patients with LAR (9.7%) versus in matched healthy controls (7.8%).64 While the literature supports LAR as a real entity, further large, multicenter, long-term, well-controlled studies with children and adults are needed to better dene the prevalence, evolution,diagnosis, and treatment of LAR. Nonallergic rhinitis By denition NAR is dened as rhinitis that is independent of an IgE-mediated mechanism that includes VMR65(sometimes referred ''nonallergic noninfectious rhinitis'' is a term sometimes used to describe this group of patients.72In reality, NAR can be acute or chronic, is often present in conjunction with AR (''mixed rhinitis'')73and is frequently associated with hyperreactivity of the nasal mucosa.74 In a study by Rondon et al,49compared with those with AR, patients w i t hN A Rw e r em o r el i k e l yt ob eo l d e ra n dt oh a v es e v e r econgestion and rhinorrhea but less likely to have asthma. The exactprevalence of NAR is unknown, but some estimates suggest that worldwide up to 200 million people have NAR. 72 Vasomotor rhinitis VMR, a subtype of NAR, can be acute or chronic and is often activated by temperature and humidity changes, especially cold dry air, airborne irritants, strong odors, including tobacco smoke, and/or exercise.75VMR, often a diagnosis of exclusion, is frequently referred to as idiopathic rhinitis.76The symptoms of VMR are variable, consisting mainly of nasal obstruction and increased clear secretion. Sneezing and pruritus are less common.Cough is also a common component of VMR. 77 ''Idiopathic rhinitis'' is sometimes used as an alternative term to VMR and usually excludes NARES.78However, the term is confusing as some studies have found high levels of eosinophilsand mast cells in some patients categorized as having idiopathic rhinitis. 79In this practice parameter we do not use the term. The diagnosis of VMR is based on exclusion of other forms of rhinitis, especially AR, infectious rhinitis, and anatomic/surgical structural changes of the nose and sinuses. The history is the most important determinant leading to diagnosis. The physical examndings can vary widely and laboratory tests, skin prick tests, and sIgE are helpful only to exclude AR. Nasal challenge for VMR, to determine nasal hyperresponsiveness (eg, using cold dry air orhypertonic saline in a challenge chamber), may be used in researchto assess drug efcacy but is rarely used for clinical diagnosis. 77,80 More recently, optical rhinometry with intranasal capsaicin chal- lenge has been demonstrated to assist in the diagnosis of a subsetof patients with VMR and nonallergic irritant rhinitis. 81While the pathophysiology of VMR is not fully understood, there is evidence that it involves a neurogenic pathway with an increase in neural efferent trafc to the nasal mucosa with an imbalance between parasympathetic and sympathetic nasalinnervation. 82Support for this is partially based on the benecial effects of ipratropium bromide and vidian neurectomy (the vidian nerve contains and sympatheticinnervation to the nasal mucosa). 82,83Subjects with predominant rhinorrhea (sometimes referred to as cholinergic rhinitis) appear to have enhanced cholinergic glandular secretory activity that can be effectively reduced with the use of atropine and ipra-tropium bromide. 84,85Patients with predominant symptoms of nasal congestion appear to have nociceptive neurons that have heightened sensitivity to stimuli such as temperature change,airborne irritants, foods (especially hot and spicy foods), alco- holic beverages, cold dry air, and exercise. 86-89Measurement of neuropeptides such as substance P in models of hypertonic salineand cold dry air-induced rhinitis further support a neurogenicmechanism for VMR. 80 However, somewhat conflicting research based on the response to intranasal capsaicin, a selective transient receptor potentialvanilloid 1 (TRPV1) receptor agonist, suggests that nociceptive C bers in the trigeminal nerve lead to hypersensitivity of the TRP ion channels on sensory afferent neurons innervating the nasalmucosa and that this can induce the symptoms of VMR. 90In clinical studies, when compared with controls, patients with irritant rhinitis have higher TRPV1 expression in the nasalmucosa and higher concentrations of substance P in nasal secretions. 91From these data, the term ''neurogenic rhinitis'' proposed to replace VMR and idiopathic rhinitis todescribe this type of NAR. Infectious rhinitis Infectious rhinitis and rhinosinusitis may be acute or chronic. Infectious rhinitis may range from self-limited rhinitis secondary to common viral upper respiratory infections to more severedisease caused by other pathogens, such as fungal infections in an immunocompromised patient. 75Acute infectious rhinitis is usu- ally a result of 1 of many viruses, but secondary bacterial infectionwith sinus involvement (bacterial rhinosinusitis) may be a complication. 1,92Viral infections account for as many as 98% of acute infectious rhinitis and the majority of rhinitis symptomsin the young child. 1Symptoms of acute infectious bacterial rhino- sinusitis include nasal congestion, mucopurulent nasal discharge, pain and pressure, headache, olfactory disturbance, postnasal drainage, and cough. While these symptoms may overlap andmimic those of AR, the presence of a recurrent seasonal pattern of symptoms, the presence of an obvious allergic trigger, and symptoms of nasal or ocular pruritus strongly suggest the diag-nosis of AR. This diagnostic distinction is important to avoid inappropriate treatment of AR. 93 Inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics is often secondary to misinterpretation of the symptoms and signs of infectious viral rhinitis/rhinosinusitis with bacterial rhinosinusitis. This has led to overprescribing antibiotics and a subsequent increase in antibioticresistance. Recent research demonstrates antibiotic prescribingrates as high as 69% to 79% for acute infectious rhinitis, which may account for up to 60% of all antibiotic prescriptions written by providers, despite often a lack of benet and increased risk ofadverse effects, including resistance. 94-105J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL OCTOBER 2020726DYKEWICZ ET ALSymptoms distinguishing viral versus bacterial infectious rhinitis/rhinosinusitis are minimal and recent evidence suggests that separating viral from bacterial infections based on clinical presentation is often not possible.99,106-108In addition, because viral-induced infectious rhinitis/rhinosinusitis can cause sinus computed (CT) that mimic acute bac- terial rhinosinusitis, a CT scan should be deferred unless com-plications are a concern. 109-111Up to 70% of children with viral infections112and as many as 87% of adults will have ab- normalities on CT scan during the common cold.113Similarly, nasal culture cytology of nasal nonbacterial infections from bacte- rial rhinosinusitis and often positive bacterial cultures from the nose or sinus may represent colonization and not a path-ogen. 93,114-116The transition from viral infectious rhinitis to bacterial rhinosinusitis and appropriate treatment for the rhino- sinusitis has been a focus of treatment guidelines due to theresistance of bacteria that are known to cause acute bacterialrhinosinusitis. 93,114,117-124Most guidelines suggest deferring antibiotic treatment for 7 to 10 days after onset of symptoms of infectious rhinosinusitis to avoid overuse of antibiotics. Con-troversies in the management of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) are addressed in the most recent Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters (JTFPP) publication on rhinosinusitis. 92 Unique populations susceptible to frequent or persistent and refractory infectious rhinitis include patients with anatomic abnormalities of the The differential diag- nosis of infectious rhinitis in children includes not only AR butforeign bodies, acute Staphylococcus aureus bacterial infection of the nares and enlarged or infected adenoids. 126 Food-induced rhinitis Gustatory rhinitis. The main symptom is clear rhinorrhea after ingestion of food, especially hot and spicy foods.127The mechanism is thought to be a neurologic reflex of the noncholin- ergic, nonadrenergic system. IgE-mediated food allergy and AR? Outside of the oral allergy syndrome (OAS),128discussed below, there is no evidence of IgE-mediated food-induced rhinitis symptoms without the presence of anaphylaxis with whole-body symptoms (eg, hives,difculty breathing, or diarrhea); therefore, there is no indicationto test for food allergens when evaluating patients presenting with symptoms of rhinitis. Furthermore, there have been no published studies of oral food challenges producing isolated rhinitis symptoms. With the specicity of both skin prick testing and sIgE testing to foods being <50%, 129and recognizing that sensitization does not equate to clinical allergy, unnecessary food testing can lead to unwar- ranted food avoidance resulting in a reduced QOL, uncalled-for nancial expenditure, and possible nutritional deciency.130,131 Testing with a ''panel'' of foods without attention to the medical history and epidemiology of AR, can result in mismanagement.132 While a high rate of sensitization to certain food (fruits, nuts, and vegetables), as demonstrated by skin prick tests or sIgE, isreported in patients with pollen-induced AR (eg, birch, mugwort, ragweed, and grass), most of these patients will not experience symptoms when ingesting cross-reacting foods. 133Patient- reported prevalence of the OAS in patients with AR variesbetween 6% and 93%, generally being higher in adults versus children; females; patients having severe rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms, multiple pollen allergies, and longer duration of AR; and in geographical locations with high pollen levels.133-137 While there have been limited studies utilizing oral food chal- lenges to diagnose OAS in patients with AR, these have reported a much lower prevalence rate of 0.1% to 4.3%.138There have been, unfortunately, no studies in the United States that haveadequately studied the prevalence of OAS including the develop- ment of rhinitis symptoms on ingestion of pollen-related foods. In patients with OAS, symptoms of itching and swelling are usuallymild and limited to the oropharyngeal area, but systemic reac- tions, including AR symptoms, have been reported. One large re- view reported that 9% of patients with OAS had systemicreactions beyond the gastrointestinal tract, which, at times, included nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and sneezing. 139In fact, compared with those without pollen-induced AR, patients withplant food reactions are at much lower risk of having systemic re-actions if they have concurrent AR pollinosis. 140 Alcohol-induced rhinitis symptoms. Alcohol-induced upper airway symptoms are felt to be due to alcohol hyper-responsiveness (including vasodilator effects) and not due to ''alcohol allergy.'' Nasal congestion is the most common alcohol- induced upper airway symptom, followed by rhinorrhea. Alcohol-induced upper respiratory symptoms have been reported in up to 14% of healthy individuals, 33% of asthmatics, and 75% of patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease. 141Alcohol hyperresponsiveness correlates with the severity of the nasal in- flammatory response, being greater in patients who have nonste- roidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) exacerbated respiratorydisease or CRS with nasal polyps (with or without asthma) thanin patients with AR or CRS without nasal polyps. 141,142In asth- matics, a corresponding increase in lower respiratory symptoms is also noted. While the triggering mechanism for alcohol-induced respiratory symptoms is unknown, the elevation of sys- temic cysteinyl leukotrienes observed following alcohol con- sumption may be at least 1 major contributing factor. 141In some patients with AR, alcohol-induced symptoms may be inter- mittent (eg, only present during seasonal exacerbations), may appear 1 hour or later following ingestion, have a duration of>1 hour but <1 day, and may require between 1 and 3 drinks for symptom provocation. 142For most affected patients, any alco- holic beverage can provoke symptoms; however, patients withCRS and without asthma have reported that wine may be worsethan other alcoholic beverages. 142Alcohol-induced symptoms in patients with NSAID-exacerbated upper respiratory disease have been reported to diminish following aspirin desensitiza-tion. 143With the above-noted association of alcohol-induced rhinitis symptoms with CRS with nasal polyps, CRS without nasal polyps, asthma, and NSAID-exacerbated respiratory dis-ease, the clinical history of alcohol as a trigger for rhinitis symp- toms should prompt the health care provider to consider these diagnoses and to pursue further diagnostic testing (eg, rhinoscopyor spirometry), if indicated. Hormonal rhinitis Estrogen- and progesterone-induced changes occurring with pregnancy, menstrual cycle, menopause, and puberty can all affect nasal congestion. Increase of estrogen can cause nasalvascular engorgement leading to congestion. In addition,J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 146, NUMBER 4DYKEWICZ ET AL can increase eosinophil migration into the nasal mucosa in contrast to testosterone, which decreases eosinophils in the nasal mucosa. This association of hormones with eosinophils may account for the greater prevalence andseverity of rhinitis in females following puberty. 144Rhinitis asso- ciated with pregnancy presents with congestion and while this may be secondary to an increase in estrogen and progesterone,the exact mechanism is not known. 145,146Other endocrine dis- eases such as hypothyroidism and rhinitis Drug-induced rhinitis can be classied based on proposed mechanism of action as local inflammatory, neurogenic, and idiopathic.147An acute inflammatory response may be induced following the ingestion of acetylsalicylic acid or other NSAIDswith isolated nasal symptoms or nasal symptoms as part of the NSAID-exacerbated respiratory disease with acute asthma symp- toms and associated CRS with nasal polyposis. Disruption of thesympathetic and parasympathetic blockers produce rhinorrhea and congestion through a neurogenic mechanism. The responsible pharmacolog- ical agents may be (1) acting mechanism has been clearly identied because there are many drugs that can produce nasal symptoms, such as calcium channel blockers,angiotensin-converting contraceptives on nasal physi- ology is uncertain although it has been suggested that oral contra-ceptives may reduce allergen-provoked nasal congestion during ovulation but increase sneezing at the end of the menstrual cy- cle. 149-151Overuse of topical decongestants can result in rhinitis medicamentosa, a form of drug-induced rhinitis, which is the intranasal decongestants section. Work-related rhinitis Work-related rhinitis comprises (1) de novo occupational rhinitis (due to exposures from a particular occupational environ-ment, not usually encountered outside the work environment) and (2) work-exacerbated rhinitis (preexisting or concurrent AR or NAR that is worsened by workplace exposures). Most occupa-tional rhinitis is due to high molecular weight agents (>10 kDa) and is IgE- and T H2 cell-driven. Low molecular weight (<10 kDa) occupational sensitizers may also induce occupationalrhinitis symptoms through mechanisms without associated IgE. 72,152Following specic inhalation challenge, when compared with low molecular weight agents, high molecularweight agents produced a signicantly higher level of acute- phase reactant proteins, cell adhesion molecules, endothelial growth factors, and vitamin D binding proteins. 153In work- exacerbated rhinitis, aggravation of rhinitis symptoms is oftencaused by nonallergic irritant triggers, such as from cold dry air, dust particles, smoke, chemicals, or strong odors. Rarely, when a single high-level exposure or multiple low-dose exposures toan irritant gas, vapor, dust, or smoke results in chronic rhinitis,this is referred to as reactive upper airways dysfunction syndrome. In nasal mucosa biopsies of individuals exposed to chlorine diox- ide, pathological changes found include induced asthma/reactive airways dysfunction syndrome,155the predominant basis for making the diagnosis of reactive upper air-ways dysfunction syndrome is based on occupational history. Atrophic rhinitis Atrophic rhinitis is a chronic nasal condition associated with atrophy of the nasal mucosa and paradoxically presents with nasal congestion due to a sensation of decreased airflow, likely a resultof decreased airflow resistance. Atrophic rhinitis can be catego- rized as primary or secondary. While the pathophysiology of primary atrophic rhinitis is unknown, it is associated withmucosal colonization, predominantly with Klebsiella ozaenae , although other organisms have also been described. Primary atro- phic rhinitis is more commonly seen in young to middle-agedadults in developing countries with dry climates, such as SaudiArabia, China, Africa, and India, and is uncommon in the United States and Europe. 156One US study of patients with atrophic rhinitis categorized approximately 19% of them as having pri-mary atrophic rhinitis; the mean age of this primary atrophic rhinitis group was 52 years. 156It is characterized by progressive atrophy of the nasal mucosa, crusts associ- ated constant awareness bad smell. Biopsy ndings consist of squamous epithelium. By denition, there is no history of nasal surgery or trauma in primary atrophic rhinitis as is often the case in secondary atrophic rhinitis. Secondary atrophic rhinitis is more common in the United States and less severe than primary atrophic rhin itis. Secondary atrophic rhinitis often d evelops as a result of excessive nasal surgery, trauma, irradiation, or chronic granulomatous nasal infections. Therefore, patient s with secondary atrophic rhinitis for which an iatrogenic cause ha s not been determined should be evaluated for an underlying inflammatory systemic disease (eg,leprosy, sarcoidosis, or syphilis ). Repeated, vault,referred to as an ''empty nose syndrome.'' 157The empty nose syndrome, as may occur after aggressive resection of the infe- rior and sometimes middle turb inates, is associated with the perception of severe nasal obstruction and inability to senseairflow through the nose. It is ''p aradoxical'' because examina- tance as assessed by rhinoman ometry is normal or low. Some patients sense profound dyspnea even though there is no pulmo- nary disease. 158,159 Treatment has traditionally focused on reduction of crust- ing.156,160Conservative treatment can consist of nasal emollients, anti- biotics, and vasodilators.157Surgical interventions attempt to decrease the size of the nasal cavities thereby promoting regener-ation and increasing lubrication of the nasal mucosa and improving nasal vascularity. This can be achieved by surgically closing the nasal cavities (modied Young procedure) or implant-ing OCTOBER 2020728DYKEWICZ ET ALHowever, a Cochrane review concluded there are no adequate ran- domized controlled studies of sufcient duration that compare these treatment options.161 NAR with eosinophilia syndrome NARES was rst was used in 1981 as a term to describe a case series of patients who were nonasthmatic that reported perennial,intermittent symptoms of profuse clear rhinorrhea and paroxysms of sneezing as well as nasal or ocular pruritus, lacrimation, and nasal congestion Patients werecharacterized by elevated nasal eosinophils >20% but with the absence of sIgE by skin and blood testing in all but 3 of 52 subjects. The original cohort included no patients with clinicalevidence of CRS with nasal polyps. Oral aspirin and inhaled methacholine challenges performed on limited numbers of sub- jects were negative. 162Onset of symptoms ranged from the rst to fth decades. However, other systematic evaluations of nonallergic subjects with eosinophilic NAR showed signicant associations with rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, sinus mucosal thickening, andasthma leading to speculation that NARES may be a prelude to the onset of CRS, asthma, or perhaps NSAID-exacerbated respiratory disease. 7,163 Blood eosinophilia is occasionally present in patients with NARES and the term ''blood eosinophilic NAR'' had been proposed but not routinely used to represent this possible condi-tion. 164The prevalence of NARES is unknown but is suspected to represent 1% to 5% of children and from 5% to 15% of adults with rhinitis.7,165,166One cluster analysis from a single center in Beijing characterized NARES in 23.6% of predominately adultsubjects with chronic rhinitis. 167Nasal eosinophilia persisted in children without allergies who were followed throughout the year including the winter season when not exposed toallergens. 166Total nasal resistance and mucociliary transport time is increased in patients with NARES versus in healthy controls.168 The differential diagnosis of persistent nasal eosinophilia includes PAR with positive allergy skin or IgE blood tests, LAR, rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, CRS without polyps,eosinophilic granuloma, allergic fungal rhinosinusitis, and NSAID-exacerbated respiratory disease. 169 NARES is particularly responsive to corticosteroids.7In 1 un- controlled study, montelukast 10 mg daily reduced nasal obstruc-tion, rhinorrhea, sneezing, and pruritus in subjects with NARES and asthma. 170Intranasal cromolyn was studied and found to have no benet in NARES.171 To date there has not been consensus regarding the specic clinical criteria for diagnosis of NARES. The lower limits of nasal eosinophilia required for diagnosis have been variable, rangingfrom 5% to 25% and the percentage may vary depending on specimen type. 172,173Current clinical guidelines have not recommended routine assessments of nasal eosinophils.1The diagnosis of NARES should be considered in patients who arenonallergic and presenting with prominent symptoms of perennial rhinorrhea and sneezing in the absence of facial pain, nasal obstruction, rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps on rhinoscopy,and sinus mucosal thickening in individuals with notable response to nasal steroids or with eosinophilia in blood or if assessed in nasal secretions.DIAGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT OF RHINITIS Methods and overview of the practice parameter guideline development process This guideline contains systematically developed recommen- dations intended to optimize care of adult and adolescent patients(>_12-15 years of age) and to assist physicians and/or other health care practitioners and patients to make decisions regarding diagnosis and therapy for rhinitis. Even though many treatmentsare approved for younger children, the application of recommen-dations to children would be partially based on data extrapolation from adult studies and would therefore be less certain. This guideline updates ''The diagnosis and management of rhinitis: anupdated practice parameter'' published in 2008. 1This guideline was not intended to be a Grading of Recommendations, Assess- ment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) document suchas we published in 2017 to update for a limited number of ques- tions for SAR. 174Because GRADE documents require a compre- hensive literature search, systematic review, and meta-analysisfor each question, they require substantial resources, making it cost prohibitive to attempt to conduct a GRADE analysis for all of the questions for which clinicians would like an answer. Inaddition, for many questions, there is very limited evidence andthe work group/Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters (JTFPP) must rely on expert evidence and opinion. Therefore, in this guideline, the only GRADE recommendations are those thatwere previously published in the 2017 rhinitis guideline update. The remainder of the recommendations are consensus-based statements (CBS), which are based, at best, on a recent literaturesearch of PubMed to update or add to the 2012 rhinitis document. We have changed our method of grading our recommendations to be more transparent, choosing words that are used in a formalGRADE document, (eg, strong and conditional), to be consistent in terminology and to maintain a common thread. However, the use of these words do not imply that we are equating our recom-mendations to the rigor required by a GRADE document. The strength of the CBSs is determined to be either strong or conditional as dened below. The certainty of evidence for each recommendation is determined to be high, moderate, low, or verylow as dened below. When the JTFPP did not have adequate published evidence with which to determine the certainty of evidence but recognized, nonetheless, the need to provideguidance to the clinician, the CBSs were based on the collective expert opinion and experience of the work group and JTFPP. We have provided the tabulated vote for and against each suchstatement. The guideline development process involves several stages. The work group begins the process by developing a list of key clinical questions and topics t o be addressed. At least 2 work group members are assigned to write and review each section.A PubMed literature search is co mpleted to determine the most updated information for each CBS and discussion. The draftsections are reviewed by the work group chair and co-chair withsubsequent revision by the authors. Subsequently, all sectionsare reviewed and revised by the entire work group throughseveral rounds of electronic and teleconference reviews. Theguideline is reviewed in detail by the JTFPP and revisions,when needed, are made in conj unction with the work group. The external review follows as described above under''resolving conflict of in terest'' in the preface ( Tables II ,III, andIV).J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 146, NUMBER 4DYKEWICZ ET AL 729Clinical history and physical examination Recommendation 1. CBS: We recommend that the clinician complete a detailed history and a physical examination in a pa-tient presenting with symptoms of rhinitis. Strength of recommendation: Strong Certainty of evidence: Low Recommendation 2. CBS: We recommend that for patients presenting with rhinitis symptoms, a review of all current medica- tions should be completed to assess whether drug-induced rhinitismay be present. Strength of recommendation: Strong Certainty of evidence: Ungraded due to lack of studies address- ing this specic issue. Note: Unanimous vote in favor by work group and JTFPP. Clinical history in patients with rhinitis. The most important single element for establishing the diagnosis of rhinitis,allergic or nonallergic, and differentiating it from other conditions with overlapping symptoms, is the clinical history. 1,20,175The age of onset, duration, frequency, severity, timing during the year, sus-pected triggers, pattern of presentation, and progression of each patient-specic symptom should be obtained and recorded. The history should include the success or failure of past therapeutic in-terventions, including self-prescribed over-the-counter medica- tions, homeopathic agents, or physician-prescribed history and personal history of comorbid respiratoryconditions (eg, asthma and chronic rhinitis with or withoutCRS) should be discussed. Because patients may not recognize symptoms of asthma, a history of symptoms suggestive of asthma (eg, wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and cough) should be sought, and if appropriate from symptoms, spirometryobtained. As noted earlier, AR coexists in about 75% to 80% of all patients with asthma, in nearly 100% of those with allergic asthma, and is a marker for more difcult-to-control or severeasthma. The overall medical, social, and psychiatric history; medication history (current and past); environmental exposures in the home or workplace; and family views on disease stateand health care should be included in the patient history. As the nal therapeutic decisions will involve shared decision making, the history should explore the wishes and desires of both the pa-tient and family in selecting diagnostic procedures and therapeu-tic interventions, including their willingness to adhere to these therapies. In clinical practice, especially in primary care, the diagnosis of AR is often made solely by history. 176The use of validated ques- tionnaires is more benecial for excluding than for conrming AR. The use of a validated 4-question screening tool has beenshown to have a high negative predictive value for positive skin prick tests to common aeroallergens. 177Furthermore, if a patient has a late onset of symptoms (age >45 years); no family history ofallergies; no seasonality of symptoms or symptoms around cats, dogs, or other furry pets; and has trouble with nonallergic triggers such as deodorants/fragrances, the likelihood of having aTABLE II. Grading the strength of the Consensus Based Statements (CBSs) Strong CBS The work group and JTFPP are condent that the desirable effects of adherence to the statement outweigh the undesirable effects. This CBS may be appropriate to be used as a practice standard indicator. When making a strong CBS, the wording is ' 'We recommend,' ' implying that the clinician ' 'shou ld' ' follow the recommendation. The implications of a strong CBS are dFor patients\u2014most people in your situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not; request discussion if th e intervention is not offered. dFor clinicians\u2014most patients should receive the recommended course of action. dFor policy makers\u2014the recommendation can be adopted as a policy in most situations. Conditional CBS The work group and JTFPP reach a decision that the desirable effects of adherence to a CBS probably outweigh the undesirable effect. When making a conditional CBS, the wording is ' 'We suggest,' ' implying that the clinician ' 'may' ' follow the recommendation. The implications of a conditional CBS are dFor patients\u2014most people in your situation would want the recommended course of action, but many would not. dFor clinicians\u2014you should recognize that different choices will be appropriate for different patients and that you must help each patient to arrive a t a man- agement decision consistent with her or his values and preferences. It is likely that shared decision making will play a major role in arriving at themanagement decision. dFor policy makers\u2014policy making will require substantial debate and involvement of many stakeholders. TABLE III. Grading the certainty of evidence for each CBS High5Further research is very unlikely to change our condence in the estimate of effect. The recommendation is based on high-quality evidence, such as multiple highly rated randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, or meta-analyses. Moderate 5Further research is likely to have an important impact on our condence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. The recommendation would likely be based on somewhat limited evidence, such as reduced number or quality of randomized controlled trials or controlled t rials without randomization.

The recommendation is based largely on very low quality studies and/or on expert opinion. CBS without determination of certainty: When there are either no published studies, or very limited and/or very weak evidence, a consensus statement without any category of certainty of evid ence was developed.

Overall, guidelines minimize or conclude that there islow-level evidence associating AR with cough without thepresence of concurrent asthma. 179,190Cough is often considered to be a comorbidity of AR rather than viewed as a direct symptom of AR. In 1 study, rhinitis was found to be an independent risk fac-tor for the development of cough in adults. 191Furthermore, in 1large multinational observational study, 47% of patients with AR frequently reported cough as a symptom, although only 11% had cough as the main reason for seeking medical atten-tion. 192In a prospective study, cough as a symptom increased from mild intermittent to moderate/severe persistent AR.193 Cough sensitivity has been described to be heightened in patients with AR, both during and outside of pollen season.194,195With up to 23% of patients with chronic cough having at least 2 contributing comorbidities (eg, AR with postnasal drip andgastroesophageal reflux disease), the complexity of managingchronic cough becomes magnied. 196 The mechanism of cough in AR has often been explained both as a rhinobronchial reflex and as part of the UACS. In nasalchallenge studies of patients with AR, cough was described most frequently in patients with PAR. 197Patients with persistent AR report more postnasal drip along with more cough.198The mech- anisms of cough from UACS in children may differ from adults and may differ among children of different age groups. In 1 Chi- nese study, rhinitis was the major pathogenesis in the school-agechildren, whereas it was adenoid hypertrophy in a group of pre-school children, indicating that mechanical obstruction may be a major cause of UACS in some children. 199 Frequently, cough in a patient with AR is related to concom- itant asthma or nonspecic bronchial hyperreactivity, often undiagnosed. Furthermore, bronchial biopsy studies in patients with AR and without asthma have shown inflammatory cellinltrate and active structural remodeling of the lower airwaysTABLE IV .(Continued) Recommendation no.

While specic nasal and diagnosis of AR, there are no patho- gnomonic ndings that distinguish allergic versus nonallergicversus infectious rhinitis. 1,179,207,208Furthermore, a patient with a history of rhinitis who is asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic at the time of the physical exam, may have mini- mal or no abnormal ndings.209While conducting a physical exam is recommended by all major rhinitis guidelines to make the diagnosis of AR,1,20,175the very limited, low-quality research evidence that is available demonstrates a much lowersensitivity and specicity and high interpreter variability forTABLE V.

The nasal-pharyngeal exam can usually be accomplished with the use of a nasal speculum with appropriate lighting or anotoscope with a nasal adapter, 1although these provide a more limited view of the nasal cavity than a nasopharyngolaryngo- scope does. For mucosal edema that prohibits an adequateexam, the use of nasal decongestant may reduce turbi- nate mucosal edema, for assessment of tympanic membrane mobility and presence of transudative fluid. At times, an impedance tympan- ometer may also be of benet to assess tympanic membranemobility and the presence/absence of middle ear fluid. A nasopharyngolaryngoscope exam should be completed when a more extensive nasal/pharyngeal/laryngeal exam isrequired due to suspected structural or functional abnormal- ities, inadequate therapeutic response, or a suspected complica- tion (eg, deviated septum, body, nasal septal perforation, or vocal cord dysfunction). Differential diagnosis of rhinitis The differential diagnosis of chronic rhinitis symptoms in- cludes AR, NAR, mixed rhinitis, including the rhinitis-specicsubtypes discussed in previous sections; common conditions that mimic rhinitis such as rhinosinusitis with or without nasal polyps and nasal septal deviation (NSD); and more uncommon condi-tions ( Table VII ). A comprehensive history, physical examina- tion, and appropriate testing is important to ascertain the correct diagnosis as this will help direct the therapeutic approach recog- nizing that some diseases mimicking rhinitis can lead to substan-tial morbidity and even mortality. Furthermore, >1 cause of nasalsymptoms can be present concurrently and contribute to the rhinitis-induced morbidity. Selected conditions that may mimic rhinitis Nasal septal deviation. NSD is a common cause of xed nasal obstruction leading to nasal congestion.211It appears to be as common an anatomical cause of congestion as nasal valve collapse and turbinate hypertrophy.212It may cause bilateral or unilateral congestion and is often associated with nasal valve collapse and compensatory turbinate hypertrophy.212-214The importance and effectiveness of septoplasty for NSD does notappear to be universally accepted. 215,216 Nasal valve collapse. The internal nasal valve is the narrowest portion of the nasal cavity and is the anatomical area bounded medially by the nasal septum and laterally by the inferioredge of the upper lateral cartilage and the anterior aspect of the inferior turbinate. As such the nasal valve is the area most commonly associated with the subjective perception of obstruc-tion and is responsible for more than two-thirds of the airflow resistance produced by the nose. 217Nasal valve collapse refers to any weakness or further narrowing of the nasal valve and canresult in change of airflow that is perceived as nasal congestion.The nasal examination should note the patency of the nasal valve and any alar collapse. If there is improvement in breathing when performing the Cottle maneuver\u2014pulling the patient's cheeklaterally to open the suggest pathology. Turbinate hypertrophy. Hypertrophy, with or without concha bullosa, can account for severe unilateral or bilateral obstruction and accounts for severe congestion equally as commonly as nasal valve collapse and septal deviation do. 212Hy- pertrophy can be primary (eg, from AR and NAR) or compensa- tory, often being associated with congenital or traumatic septal deviation.213While medical treatment for some causes of turbi- nate hypertrophy (eg, AR) can be very effective, not infrequentlya surgical approach will be required for other causes. The consensus for treatment in refractory cases can include turbinate reduction. 218-220When performing septoplasty for unilateral NSD, it is often necessary to also perform turbinate reductionTABLE VI. Physical examination of patient presenting with symptoms compatible with rhinitis Vital signs (including weight and height): Record on all patients. General observations: facial pallor, elongated facies, preferred mouth breathing, and any evidence of systemic disease.Eyes: Excessive lacrimation, erythema, and swelling of the outer eyelids, Dennie-Morgan or venous stasis below the lower eyelids (''allergic shiners,' ' which may occur in AR or NAR). Nose: Reduced patency of nasal valve; alar collapse; transverse external external deformity such as saddle nose (loss of nasal bridge that ma y occur from nasal trauma or systemic disorders such as relapsing polychondritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, cocaine abuse, or some tions); septal deviation or perforation, edema, pallor or er ythema, and crusting; discharge (amount, color, consistency), and nasal polyps. The presence of tumors or foreign bodies should be noted. Ears: Tympanic membrane dullness, erythema, retraction, perforation, and air-fluid levels.Oropharynx: Halitosis, dental malocclusion or high arched palate associated with chronic mouth breathing, tonsillar or AH, cobblestoning of the oropharyngeal wall, pharyngeal postnasal discharge, temporomandibular joint pain or clicking with occlusion, or ulceration of tongue or Lymphadenopathy, or tenderness, thyroid enlargement or nodule.Chest: Signs of asthma such as wheezing or other abnormal or diminished sounds by auscultation.Skin: Rashes, especially eczematous or urticarial (distribution and description), or dermatographism.

Cerebral spinal fluid leak usually presents as a unilateral clear rhinorrhea, without congestion, oftenworsened in the upright position, and increased in frequency following head trauma or surgery; however, some cases may be spontaneous. 222Suggested diagnostic testing in the past included glucose determination, normally found in cerebral spinal fluid, but not in nasal secretions. A determination of beta-2 transferrin levels in nasal drainage is now the preferred test. Nasal drainagecan be collected and remain stable at room temperature for a week or more. 222For diagnostic conrmation and preparation for surgery, high-resolution CT and magnetic resonance cisternogra-phy are accurate, noninvasive, and complementary. 223Treatment is often surgical in the form of endoscopic or open repair to prevent complications, which include meningitis.222,224-226 Adenoidal hypertrophy. Adenoidal hypertrophy (AH) is among the most common anatomic causes of nasal obstruction in children. Lateral x-ray of the nasopharynx is an effective tool to assess for AH in children and ndings correlate well withsymptoms. 227The combination of clinical assessment (good specicity) with lateral x-ray (good sensitivity) is a good method for assessment of the degree of AH.228In addition, when feasible, the severity of AH can usually be adequately assessed by the na-sopharyngolaryngoscope exam. 229Complications include acute and recurrent otitis, otitis media with effusion, hypoacusia, altered speech development, and sleep-disordered breathing. Pro-longed mouth breathing may lead to defective dental growth and facial bone development. Medical therapy includes topical nasal corticosteroids, which are found to be effective with high-qualityevidence, montelukast, or a combination of both; however, data suggest that single drug therapy may be just as effective as the combination. 230-232When medical therapy fails, surgical removal should be considered. Young age and apnea hypopnea index >1 increase the likelihood that surgery will be necessary.233 Nasal foreign body. Nasal foreign bodies are common among young children.234-236Most cases present with unilateral congestion and foul-smelling purulent rhinorrhea. Foreign bodies are estimated to account for 30% of ear, nose, and throat emergen- cies of which 19% are intranasal.234Complications of nasal foreign bodies include infection, nasal perforation and epistaxis.235Of particular importance is the increase of nasal impaction with button batteries that can be corrosive and lead to septal perforation.237 Removal may require general anesthesia, especially in cases of pro- longed impaction because of associated inflammation.238 Ciliary dyskinesia. Ciliary dyskinesia can be primary or secondary. Secondary ciliary dysfunction can result from chronicinfections, irritants, or multiple nasal surgeries and might be transient and reversible. Primary ciliary dyskinesia is a raregenetic disorder, referred to as immotile-cilia syndrome, that may present with cough, nasal congestion and symptoms of asthma, CRS with nasal polyps (in children and adults), bronchiectasis, recurrent otitis, rhinitis, rhinosinusitis. In addition, infertilityand situs immotile-cilia syndrome. Unfortunately, there is no ''gold standard'' for the diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia. 239Most of the individual tests are subject to a false positive and/or a false negative result. An algorithmic-driven approach using a combination of tests has been published both by the European Respiratory Society andthe American Thoracic Society. 240,241Given a suggestive history of cystic brosis and immunodeciency disor- ders, screening tests start the diagnostic process. In the past,screening tests included saccharine transit time or nasal challengewith tagged particles but these tests are no longer recommended. Currently, the rst step in the European Respiratory Society algorithmic-driven approach is to obtain nasal nitric equivocal or normal, a nasal mucosal brush specimen is sent for transmission electron microscopy and forcell culture and repeat high-speed videomicroscopy analysis. 240 If the results are still equivocal, genetic testing for known primaryciliary dyskinesia variants is then completed. 240However, it is possible for the patient to have an unrecognized genetic defect.Many of the tests above described are only available in specialty centers. Additional testing methods (eg, inhalation of colloid albumin-tagged technetium Tc aresearch Pharyngonasal reflux. Pharyngonasal reflux secondary to prematurity or neuromuscular diseases may present as congestionin early life. In addition, esophageal reflux can cause nasal symptoms in adults and children and may even predispose to obstructive sleep apnea. 242The most common symptom of eosin- ophilic esophagitis is reflux, and eosinophilic esophagitis is frequently associated with rhinitis and especially symptoms of AR.243Testing for and treatment of reflux in sinonasal disease lacks consensus, and most available data refer to reflux causingpharyngeal and laryngeal disease without focus on isolated nasal symptoms. 244,245 Nasal/sinus tumor. Two recent documents from the World Health Organization address ear, nose, and throat tumors.

CBS: We recommend that the clinician not perform food skin prick testing or sIgE for foods in their routine evaluation of a patient presenting with the signs and symp-toms compatible with the diagnosis of AR.

Diagnostic testing Diagnosing rhinitis may be possible combining the patient's history and physical ndings. However, in most cases, laboratoryand/or skin tests will conrm the diagnosis. Classically this was done by conjunctival challenge to grass pollen by Noon 248as he pioneered allergen immunotherapy (AIT). Throughout the earlypart of the 20th century, skin tests, both puncture and intradermal,were the rule. Once IgE was discovered, in vitro laboratory tests could identify antibodies to specic allergens. The 2008 Practice Parameters Allergy Diagnostic Tests 76 stated: ''Prick/puncture tests or intracutaneous tests are the preferred techniques for IgE-mediated hypersensitivity. It is advisable to use prick/puncture devices, which are relatively non- traumatic and elicit reproducible results when placed on specicareas of the body (ie, arms or back). Optimal results depend on useof potent test extracts and prociency of the skin tester (ie, demonstration of coefcient of variation 30% at different pe- riods). Intracutaneous tests are generally used for specic aller-gens (ie, Hymenoptera venoms and penicillin), but they may also be applied if prick/puncture test results are negative and there is a strong historical likelihood of clinical allergy to specic aller-gens.'' A 2016 meta-analysis of 7 studies with 430 patients found that skin prick testing sensitivity was 85% and specicity 77%. 249 Intradermal studies were too few to give signicant results. A large study from Turkey250compared intradermal with skin prick tests. Among 4223 patients with AR and/or asthma, prick tests were positive in 57% of subjects. Intradermal tests were applied to 344 patients with marked allergic symptoms; 44%were positive: 33% to dust mites, 22% to fungal spores. These were not compared with nasal challenge results. Other studies have suggested that in the presence of negative skin prick tests,positive intradermal tests to aeroaellergens may often indicate FIG 1. Rhinitis Control Assessment Test.

A subsequent study further validated the VASand determined that changes in the VAS of 23 mm were foundto be clinically signicant. 254A large European study found a smart phone app using the MASK (Mobile Airways Sentinel network)-Rhinitis VAS to be a reliable indicator of AR controland this control correlated well to work productivity. 262,263 Control of AR In addition to assessing AR severity and the impact on QOL, assessing control is an important goal. As has been shown to be helpful with asthma, AR severity can be measured in patientsbefore treatment while measures of disease control are more applicable to optimize therapy in treated patients. 264The Rhinitis Control Assessment Test, is a simple, reliable, self-administered6-item questionnaire utilizing a 5-point Likert scale(Fig 1 ). 265-268Developed to assist physicians in the assessment of patient rhinitis control in clinical practice, it also helps patients appreciate what rhinitis control is. The Rhinitis ControlAssessment Test was developed and validated against total nasal symptom scores and the physician's global assessment. Subsequent work identied a cutoff score of 21 as representinggood control, with a minimal important difference of 3. Downloadable forms for administering the Rhinitis Control Assessment Test are readily available online (eg, atAllergyAsthmaNetwork.org). The Allergic Rhinitis Control Test is a validated 5-item self- assessment using a 5-point frequency scale with similarities to theAsthma Control Test. 103,269,270The Control of Allergic Rhinitis and Asthma Test25is a validated 10-item questionnaire that was tested in patients consulting an allergist.271-273Limitations exist for control-based classications as it is not clear whether AR con-trol varies as a function of the disease-inducing allergen, and these questionnaires have not been validated in children. 32,264 PHARMACOTHERAPY Review of monotherapy and then combination pharmacologic therapeutic options for rhinitis (with an emphasis on treatment ofAR) is presented rst.

Review of pharmacotherapy classes for rhinitis Oral antihistamines. Recommendation 6. CBS: We recommend against prescribing a rst-generation antihistamine and are in favor of a second-generation antihistamine when pre-scribing an oral antihistamine for the treatment of AR. Strength of recommendation: Strong Certainty of evidence: High Oral antihistamines are of established benet in overall efcacy rst-generation management of AR symptoms has notbeen adequately studied. However, selecting a second-generationantihistamine reduces the potential side effects including seda-tion, performance impairment, poor sleep quality, andanticholinergic-mediated symptoms (eg, dry eyes, dry mouth,constipation, urinary hesitancy, and retention) that have beenassociated with the rst-generation antihistamines. 1 First-generation antihistamines may produce performance impairment in school274-276and while driving277-281that can exist without subjective awareness of sedation,282and the use of rst- generation antihistamines has been associated with increased automobile and occupational accidents.277-281 ,283Individual vari- ation exists with respect to development withrst-generation antihistamines. 276,284,285One systematic review of rst-generation antihistamines concluded that they induced nonamnestic decits in attention and information processing.286 One early study compared chlorpheniramine with placebo and found that drowsiness and dry mouth were greater with chlor- pheniramine for the rst 2 weeks, but after this time point, dosesof chlorpheniramine <24 mg/day, compared with placebo, re- sulted signicant difference in subjective drowsiness, dizzi- ness, irritability, or dry mouth over the remaining 6 weeks of thestudy. 287Other studies using chlorpheniramine as a comparator have reported similar increased symptoms of drowsiness, dry mouth, and dizziness for the rst few days but tolerance to these subjective side effects of this medication occurred overtime. 288-290Tolerance to adverse central nervous system effects in an individual may or may not occur with regular daily use.291 Although bedtime dosing of rst-generation oral antihistamines has been suggested as a strategy to avoid daytime sedation, there can be residual central nervous system effects the next day because some agents have a very long terminal eliminationhalf-life (>24 onset of restful rapid eye movement sleep and re-duces the duration of rapid eye movement sleep. 291,293 Beyond concerns about subjectively perceived side effects, among the anticholinergic side effects more recently reported in association with rst-generation antihistamines is an associatedhigher risk of dementia. A 2015 US prospective population-based cohort study suggested a link between higher cumulative use of strong anticholinergics and the risk of developing dementia, withover 70% being diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. 294For de- mentia, adjusted hazard ratios for 10 of cumulative anticho- linergic use (including rst-generation antihistamines, nonuse were 0.92 (95% CI, 0.74-1.16) for total standardized daily doses for 1 to 90 days, with a proportional increased risk forlonger daily use, with a cumulative 3 years of daily use being1.54 (95% CI, 1.21-1.96). 294A longitudinal study showed that the use of anticholinergics in the elderly was associated with both reduced immediate recall and reduced executive func-tioning, which was associated in conjunction with increased brain atrophy manifest as reduced total cortical volume and temporal lobe cortical thickness and greater lateral ventricle and inferiorlateral of rst-generation antihistamines in the treatment of NAR Patients with NAR and AR experience similar symptoms including nasal congestion, postnasal drainage and rhinorrheaalthough through different mechanistic pathways. 296Responses to various treatments in NAR and AR may vary.297A major symp- tom of patients with NAR that is frequently not well controlled despite combination topical nose sprays with anticholinergic ac-tivity is postnasal drainage. 296There are no DBPC the therapeutic efcacy safety of oral such as chlorpheniramine maleate for the treat-ment of NAR/VMR. In a risk/benet assessment, mindful of (1) the considerable concerns about safety of rst-generation antihis- tamines as reviewed under discussion for Recommendation 6, and(2) recognition that it is not possible in a standard ofce setting toaccurately assess development of some clinical adverse effects from these agents (eg, development of subtle changes in cognition or other potential central nervous system side effects such asdecreased reaction time), some clinicians suggest that monitored use of rst-generation oral antihistamines as an adjunctive anti- cholinergic agent may be considered in patients with NAR whohave bothersome postnasal drainage refractory to other therapies. The decision to use rst-generation antihistamines for NAR re- mains controversial, should be individualized, and should involvea physician and patient-shared decision-making discussion, re- viewing the potential risks and benets, and patient preferences. If rst-generation oral antihistamines are used to treat postnasaldrip in VMR/NAR, patients should be carefully monitored forany clinically observable side effects, the lowest effective dose should be used, and these agents should be discontinued when side effects are identied. Special consideration/caution shouldbe taken into account using these agents in frail elderly pa- tients, 298individuals with existing known benign prostatic hyperplasia) that wouldbe complicated by their use or those working in occupations involving heavy machinery, driving, or flying. Oral leukotriene receptor antagonists Recommendation 7. CBS: We suggest that the clinician not select the oral leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) montelukast for the initial treatment of AR due to reduced efcacy when compared with that of other agents. Furthermore, serious neuropsy-chiatric events that may include suicidal thoughts or actions havebeen reported in some patients taking montelukast. As advised by the FDA, montelukast should be used to treat AR only in patients who are not treated effectively with or cannot tolerate other alterna-tive therapies. Strength of recommendation: Conditional Certainty of evidence: Very low Recommendation 8. CBS: We recommend that the clinician not select an oral LTRA for the treatment of NAR. Strength of recommendation: Conditional Certainty of evidence: Ungraded as there are no studies. Note: Unanimous vote in favor by work group and JTFPP. LTRAs are modestly effective in the treatment of SAR and PAR. 299-302Multiple systematic reviews have concluded that LTRAs have effectiveness similar to oral antihistamines with lor- atadine as the usual comparator,301,303-306but others nd that LTRAs are less effective than antihistamines.306LTRAs are less effective than INCS.301,304-306Considering that the LTRAmontelukast is equally or less effective than oral antihistamines for AR and is less effective than INCS (which would be preferred therapy for more severe AR because of greater effectiveness), cli- nicians should not routinely offer an LTRA as preferred therapyfor patients with AR. Furthermore, as discussed below, serious neuropsychiatric events that may include suicidal thoughts or ac- tions have been reported in some patients taking montelukast. Asadvised by the FDA, montelukast should be used to treat AR onlyin patients who are not treated effectively with or cannot tolerate other alternative therapies. 307In such patients, when considering montelukast, a shared-decision making conversation should beutilized. The use of an oral LTRA in combination with an oral antihistamine may be more effective than monotherapy with anLTRA (montelukast) for AR, although not all study results are consistent with this nding. 304,308,309The combination of an oral LTRA and an oral antihistamine is similarly effective as mono-therapy with an INCS for AR though it is likely more costlyand burdensome to maintain. 310,311 There is no evidence to support the use of LTRAs in NAR. There is no mechanistic rationale or expert opinion that supportsthe use of an LTRA in NAR. Montelukast has been approved down to 6 months of age. It is not associated with somnolence and side effects are uncom-mon. 312,313However, there are postmarketing reports of rare drug-induced neuropsychiatric events including sleep distur- bances, depression, anxiety, aggression, psychotic reactions,and suicidal thinking and behavior. Infants are more prone to drug-associated sleep disturbances; children present most often with symptoms of depression and anxiety; and adolescents aremore prone to symptoms of depression, anxiety, and suicidalbehavior. 314-317Unexpectedly, a worldwide review of Individual Case Safety Reports associated with montelukast determined that completed suicides were reported more frequently for childrenthan for adolescents or the total population. 316Most studies are low-quality evidence, (eg, case reports or observational studies), mainly in children and adolescents; high-quality epidemiologicalstudies are needed to evaluate the association and quantify the risk of neuropsychiatric adverse events, not only in children and ado- lescents, but also in adults. 317It is advised that clinicians monitor patients who may be at elevated risk for suicidal ideation or psy- chiatric symptoms. In patients with AR comorbid with asthma, compared with placebo, montelukast could result in signicant improvements inboth conditions and therefore can be considered an option for patients with both conditions. 310,318However, due to the only modest efcacy and also the potential increased risks of montelu-kast compared with those of oral antihistamines, for the manage- ment of AR and comorbid asthma, the clinician should weigh the benets of montelukast monotherapy versus an inhaled cortico-steroid for asthma and an antihistamine or INCS for AR. Systemic corticosteroids Recommendation 9 .CBS: We suggest that for the treatment of very severe or intractable AR, the clinician may consider a shortcourse (5-7 days) of oral corticosteroids. Strength of recommendation: Conditional Certainty of evidence: Very low Recommendation 10 .CBS: We suggest that for the treatment of very severe or intractable AR, the clinician not prescribe aJ ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 146, NUMBER 4DYKEWICZ ET AL 743depot parenteral corticosteroid for AR due to the potential risks of systemic and local corticosteroid side effects. Strength of recommendation: Conditional Certainty of evidence: Low While most clinicians will use a short course (5-7 days) of oral corticosteroids for severe or intractable AR, depot parenteral corticosteroids may be viewed as attractive because the durationof action of a single injection is 3 weeks or longer and is oftenadequate to treat an entire allergy season. However, there is concern that depot corticosteroids may lead to a higher risk for adrenal suppression than short courses of short-acting corticoste-roids (eg, prednisone) dosed once daily. While head-to-head comparisons of short courses of oral corticosteroids versus single injections of depot corticosteroids have not been completed,studies have shown adrenal suppression following a single intramuscular injection of methylprednisolone acetate for AR. 319,320The suppression is usually maximal at 72 hours but persists for up to 3 weeks.319,320Two systematic reviews looking at adrenal suppression from various administration forms, dos- ages, duration, and disease states found that while higher doses for longer duration increased the risk of adrenal suppression, thereis no method of delivery, dosage, or duration for which the risk of adrenal suppression can be safely excluded. 321,322 A large retrospective study of Danish National Registries found that in patients with AR, a minimum of 1 depot corticosteroid injection for at least 3 consecutive years was associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis and diabetes, with the largest riskincrease seen within the rst 2 years of annual use. 323Although rare, local muscle atrophy and fat necrosis has also been described.324,325With such variability in the development of ad- renal suppression, diabetes, osteoporosis, local side effects, andother steroid-induced adverse effects from one patient to another, the clinician is advised to always use the lowest dose of cortico- steroids for the shortest period of time. INTRANASAL AGENTS Intranasal antihistamines Recommendation 11. CBS: We recommend that the clinician offer intranasal antihistamines (INAH) as an initial treatment op-tion for patients with SAR. Strength of recommendation: Strong Certainty of evidence: High Recommendation 12. CBS: We recommend that the clinician offer INAH as a rst-line monotherapy option for patients with NAR. Strength of recommendation: Strong Certainty of evidence: High Recommendation 13 .CBS: We recommend that the clinician offer INAH as a rst-line option for patients with intermittent AR. Strength of recommendation: Conditional Certainty of evidence: Ungraded due to lack of studies address- ing this specic issue. Note: There was a unanimous vote in favor by work group and JTFPP. For relief of nasal symptoms of SAR, INAH are equal to or superior to oral antihistamines 326-328and may benet patients for whom oral antihistamine treatment fails.328,329INAH have a more rapid onset of action than INCS and oral antihistamines do,326-332 are more effective than oral antihistamines in the control of nasal congestion,320,327,331and provide a favorable safety prole.Comparisons of INCS to INAH for reduction of nasal symptoms are conflicting, with some showing equality333-335and some showing superiority of INCS.336In a systematic review of INCS and INAH, INAH provide relief of allergiceye symptoms. 337Two INAH, azelastine and olopatadine, are approved by the FDA for the treatment of SAR. Azelastine is also approved for the treatment of PAR and VMR. Azelastine has high binding afnity to H1 receptors and can also inhibit H2 antihistamine receptors, as well as the synthesis or expression of mediators of allergic inflammation and neuropep- tides.338-340Azelastine may also work in part by desensitizing TRPV1 ion channels, which are triggered by hot stimuli, such as capsaicin, and are important in the pathophysiology of NAR.90In tive H1 receptor antagonist that has also been shown to have some mast cell-inhibitory properties, described with the olopatadine eye drop preparation.341 INAH have a rapid onset of action in AR ranging from 15 to 30 minutes, compared with an average of 150 minutes for oral antihistamines.326-332 ,338They have been shown to improve nasal as well as nonnasal AR symptoms and QOL.330,331,342Azelastine has also been shown to be clinically effective in controlling symp- toms of NAR.343Although olopatadine has been demonstrated to signicantly reduce nasal symptoms induced by a hyperosmolarmannitol challenge in patients with vasomotor NAR, there are no placebo-controlled trials to support its efcacy in relief of NAR symptoms. 344 Nineteen percent of patients treated with azelastine in the initial clinical trials reported bitter taste lasting around 30 minutes.343Subsequent studies found that using azelastine as 1 puff each nostril twice daily reduced total nasal symptoms scoresand was associated with less somnolence and bitter taste (0.4% and 8.3%, respectively) compared with what was reported in the pivotal trials (11.5% and 19.7%, respectively). 345Reformulat- ing azelastine nasal spray with sucralose to mask the bitter taste demonstrated similar safety and tolerance prole to the original formulation and a reduction in bitter taste (from 8% to7%). 65,346In contrast to the pivotal SAR studies, somnolence was not an issue for patients with NAR using azelastine with sucralose compared with those using placebo (3.2% vs1.0%). 338,340,343While the initial clinical trials using a larger dose reported somnolence in around 11%,347more recent studies have found rates of 0.4% to 3%, which were equal or only slightlygreater than in placebo groups. 346,348-351Intranasal olopatadine was well tolerated with the most common adverse events reported being bitter taste, headache, epistaxis, and pharyngolar- yngeal pain with a relatively low incidence of somnolence(<1%). 352-355 Intranasal olopatadine and azelastine have been compared in a placebo-controlled multicenter trial in patients with SAR andwere shown to be equally effective in controlling symptoms. 356 Moreover, their side effect proles were comparable except forbitter taste, which was more pronounced for azelastine. 356 A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, and intranasal with nonallergic VMR. 357No signicant differences were observed for adverse events, including taste, or treatment satisfaction between treatment groups.357While taste aversion has been demonstrated to all INAH, taste varies betweenformulations. Therefore, a trial of a second formulation mayJ ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL OCTOBER 2020744DYKEWICZ ET ALidentify a preferred alternative formulation in patients who have had symptomatic benet from an INAH. Intranasal corticosteroids Recommendation 14 .CBS: We recommend that when choosing monotherapy for persistent AR, INCS be the preferredmedication. Strength of recommendation: Strong Certainty of evidence: High Recommendation 15 .GRADE: 174We recommend that for the initial treatment of moderate/severe SAR in patients 15 years of age and older, the clinician use an INCS over an LTRA. (Also see Recommendation 7.) Strength of the recommendation: Strong Certainty of evidence: High INCS remain the most effective monotherapy for AR and are therefore recommended as preferred monotherapy for moderate/ severe AR that have negative impact on QOL.1,310,311,358-360 More recent guidelines continue to support this recommenda- tion.175,361Not only are these agents effective in controlling nasal symptoms in patients with AR, but they have also been shown to be effective in the control of allergic ocular symptoms.1,362,363 The sensory attributes of INCS (aftertaste, nose runout, throat rundown, and smell) play an important role in patient preference and adherence to therapy.364To address some of these concerns, nonaqueous intranasal preparations with hydrofluoroalkane aero-sol are now available for the treatment of AR in the United States. 365-367 When given in recommended doses, INCS are not generally associated with clinically signicant systemic side effects.1They have not been shown to affect the hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal axis.1A meta-analysis of relevant trials relating to growth in children suggests that short-term use of INCS may decreaseshort-term growth velocity (using knemometry), but there was no such effect on longer-term growth velocity (using stadiometry). 368The heterogeneity of the studies was high in the stadiometry trials. Therefore, when using INCS in children, it is prudent to use the lowest effective dose and monitor growth carefully. There have been reports of a possible association between the development of posterior subcapsular cataracts and the use of intranasal or inhaled corticosteroids in older patients. Casereports of increased ocular pressure from INCS have beenpublished; 369however, adequately powered, blinded studies have not conrmed this adverse effect.1,370A meta-analysis of 10 clinical trials with 2226 patients did not show a signicantrisk of elevating intraocular pressure or developing a posterior subcapsular cataract in patients with AR using INCS. 371 The most common side effects of INCS are local and include dryness, burning, stinging, blood tinged secretions, and epistaxis. The incidence of epistaxis ranges from 4% to 8% over short treatment periods (2 to 12 weeks) and can reach 20% in studiescarried over a year. 1,175Nasal bleeding with long-term use of topical nasal corticosteroids may approach 28%.370The epistaxis reported from INCS can worsened by the use of anticoagulantagents. 372-375 Septal perforations, although rare, have been reported.1,175Bi- opsy from the nasal mucosa of patients with perennial rhinitis who have been treated with INCS continuously for 1 to 5years showed no evidence of atrophy. 1,175Intranasal capsaicin Capsaicin, a pungent compound found in hot red peppers, topically applied to the nasal mucosa has been shown to reducenasal hyperreactivity. While capsaicin has not been approved by the FDA for the treatment of rhinitis, it has been used for the treatment of NAR or mixed rhinitis to reduce nasal congestion,rhinorrhea, postnasal drainage, sinus pressure, sinus pain, andheadache. Capsaicin is a selective TRPV1 ion channel agonist that reduces nerve conduction of nociceptive postnasal symptoms. 90,91,296,376-381Clinical trials investigating the therapeutic benet of capsaicin on patients with AR did notnd a signicant effect in reducing nasal hyperreactivity or in improving rhinorrhea. 382Cochrane analysis for AR found only 1 small trial where intranasal capsaicin had a therapeutic benet.383 For the treatment of idiopathic NAR, a recent Cochrane analysis found that capsaicin appears to improve nasal symptoms, which can last 36 weeks after treatment, but this assessment is basedon only a few small studies of low scientic evidence quality. 384 When used to treat NAR and VMR compared with placebo thera- pies, some studies have described signicant therapeutic efcacy and safety of chronic usage of local capsaicin formulations.385-390 Because all of these trials used different study designs and dosing regimens, the ability to compare primary endpoints is signicantly limited.385,387,388,391,392Recent data comparing idiopathic and mixed rhinitis treated with capsaicin demonstrated a slightly increased symptom reduction in the idiopathic treatment group than in the mixed rhinitis group (79% and 68%, respectively).393 Future well-conducted, large, randomized controlled trials arerequired to further assess the effectiveness of capsaicin using different concentrations and in patients with NAR who have mild, moderate, and severe symptoms. Intranasal decongestants Recommendation 16. CBS: We suggest that the use of intra- nasal decongestants be short term and used for intermittent or episodic therapy of nasal congestion. Strength of the recommendation: Conditional Certainty of evidence: Low Recommendation 17. CBS: We suggest that in patients having severe mucosal edema, which impairs the delivery of other intra-nasal agents, an intranasal decongestant be considered for up to 5days of use. Strength of recommendation: Conditional Certainty of evidence: Ungraded due to lack of studies address- ing this specic issue. Note: There was a unanimous vote in favor by work group and JTFPP. Intranasal decongestants, such as oxymetazoline and They cause improvement in nasal conductance for up to 10 hours resulting in nasalvasoconstriction and decreased nasal edema but they do not block allergen-provoked mediator release. 394,395Oxymetazoline and xylometazoline cause similar decongestive changes in nasal resistance, nasalairflow, and nasal cross-sectional areas that provide clinically meaningful improvement in nasal congestion. 396On average, the effect of oxymetazoline begins within 30 seconds.397Xylome- tazoline was found to have superior efcacy for nasalJ CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 146, NUMBER in a 28-day AR study.398How- ever, intranasal decongestants are not routinely recommended for continuous use because of the potential development of alpha- receptor tachyphylaxis and subsequent rhinitis medicamentosa.399 The development of rhinitis medicamentosa is highly variable; it may develop within 3 days of use or fail to develop after 6 weeks of daily use.399-404Intranasal decongestants have no effect on itch- ing, sneezing, or nasal secretion and can be associated with localstinging or burning, sneezing, and dryness of the nose and throat. Concomitant administration of intranasal decongestants and corticosteroids Recent placebo-controlled studies of PAR and SAR demonstrated that concurrent administration of INCS and intranasal decongestants provided additional efcacy both subjectively in rapidity of onset compared with the corticosteroid alone and in magnitude of nasalcongestion symptom score improvement compared with oxymeta- zoline alone and objectively as measured by acoustic rhinometry increases involume. Furthermore, when the decongestant was givenalong with the intranasal steroid once a day for up to 4 weeks, the development of rhinitis medicamentosa did not occur. 405,406(Also see Recommendation 24 for related recommendation about com-bined use of intranasal decongestants and corticosteroids.) Safety concerns about use of intranasal decongestants in pregnancy are discussed in the later section on rhinitis in pregnancy. Oral decongestants Recommendation 18. CBS: We suggest that oral decongestant agents be used with caution in older adults and children younger than 4 years old, and in patients of any age who have a history ofcardiac arrhythmia, angina pectoris, cerebrovascular disease, un- controlled hypertension, bladder outlet obstruction, glaucoma, hyperthyroidism, or Tourette syndrome. Strength of recommendation: Conditional Certainty of evidence: Low Recommendation 19. CBS: We recommend that oral decon- gestants be avoided during the rst trimester of pregnancy. Strength of recommendation: Strong Certainty of evidence: Low The oral decongestant pseudoephedrine, an alpha-adrenergic agonist, is effective at relieving nasal congestion. It is indicated for nasal congestion due to AR, rhinosinusitis, and the common cold. 407For the management of concomitant SAR and mild/mod- erate asthma, the combination of an oral decongestant and a second-generation oral antihistamine, compared with placebo, signicantly reduced both rhinitis and asthma symptoms.408 Pseudoephedrine is a key ingredient used in making metham- phetamine. In an effort to reduce illicit production of metham-phetamine, restrictions have been placed on the sale ofpseudoephedrine in the United States. 409This has promoted sub- stitution of oral phenylephrine for pseudoephedrine in many al- lergy and cold and cough remedies. However, oralphenylephrine has been demonstrated to be ineffective atreducing nasal congestion at doses up to 40 mg. 410-412 Pseudoephedrine can result in adverse effects such as insomnia, loss of appetite, irritability, and palpitations.413Eleva- tion of blood pressure after taking an oral decongestant is very rarely noted in normotensive patients and only occasionally in pa-tients with controlled hypertension. A meta-analysis of 24 trialsshowed a statistically signicant elevation of systolic blood pres- sure in both patients who are normotensive and those with controlled hypertension, but these small values, 0.99 mm Hg and 1.2 mm Hg, respectively, are unlikely to be clinically signif-icant in most patients. 414However, because of the variation in pa- tient response, patients receiving oral decongestants should be followed for changes in blood pressure. Because of the potentialfor drug interactions, oral decongestants should be avoided in pa-tients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors, 415used for psychiat- ric disorders and Parkinson's disease. Oral decongestants should be used with caution in patients with rhinitis with certain condi-tions, such as cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease, hyper- thyroidism, closed-angle glaucoma, bladder outlet obstruction, and Tourette syndrome. The problem of rebound congestion isnot a factor with the use of orally administered nasal decongestants. 407 Oral decongestants, when used in appropriate doses, are usually well tolerated in children over the age of 6 years of age.However, use in infants and young children has been associated with agitated psychosis, ataxia, hallucinations, and even death. 416-418At times, even at recommended doses, these agents may cause increased stimulatory effects resulting in tachyarrhyth- mias, insomnia, and hyperactivity, especially when combined with other stimulants.419Therefore, the risks and benets should be carefully considered before using oral decongestants in both adults and children. Safety concerns about use of oral decongestants in pregnancy are discussed in the later section on rhinitis in pregnancy. Intranasal ipratropium Recommendation 20. CBS: We suggest that in patients with PAR and NAR who have rhinorrhea as their main nasal symptombe offered intranasal ipratropium. Certainty of evidence: Low for PAR, moderate for NAR. Ipratropium bromide at either 0.03% or 0.06% concentrations is safe, well-tolerated, and is effective for the treatment of rhinorrhea related to PAR (0.03%) and NAR (0.03%), as well as for the (0.06%). 420-422While ipratropium bro- mide 0.06% is FDA-approved for the treatment of SAR in both children and adults, no randomized controlled trials have been completed to study its effectiveness.423Rhinorrhea is signi- cantly reduced rhinorrhea (eg, skiers nose), signicant effect on congestion or sneezing. 420,424-428When ipratropium bromide was administered prior to nasal methacho-line challenge in patients with AR and NAR there was reduced rhinorrhea and sneezing but there was no signicant effect on airway resistance. 422,429Rhinorrhea was signicantly reduced not only in cold air exposure but also following ingestion of hot soup, leading the investigators to suggest that the nasal discharge is reflex-mediated.430In PAR, ipratropium bromide was effective in reducing rhinorrhea for 1 year when used on a continuous ba- sis.427The efcacy of ipratropium appears to especially benet anterior rhinorrhea. It has not been shown to be of signicantvalue when postnasal drainage is the dominant complaint. Themost common adverse effects reported are nasal dryness and epistaxis, although these are usually mild and rarely lead to discontinuation of treatment. 427,428As discussed under the sec- tion on combination therapy, when bromide isJ OCTOBER oral second-generation mine, an additive benet has been demonstrated. Recommendation 21. CBS: We suggest that intranasal cromo- lyn be offered as an option to be taken just prior to allergen expo-sure to reduce symptoms of AR from episodic allergen exposures. Strength of recommendation: Conditional Certainty of evidence: Very low The primary benet of cromolyn sodium is to stabilize mast cells and thus inhibit the release of mast cell mediators that promote IgE-mediated AR. 431,432Intranasal administration of cromolyn sodium, compared with placebo, improves symptomsof SAR. 433-435In PAR, with marked skin test responses,436benet has been found in some but not all studies of patients with PAR.437 Intranasal cromolyn may reduce allergen- induced nasal airway resistance in 80% and 50% of subjects at 4 and 8 hours, respectively, after the administration of cromolyn,suggesting efcacy for around 6 hours. 439A large 2-week randomized, DBPC, cromolyn sodium demon- strated efcacy (reduction overall symptoms, sneezing, andnasal congestion) and concluded intranasal cromolyn was safe and effective for over-the-counter use. 431,435 Nasal cromolyn administered just before allergen exposure can reduce development of symptoms of AR.440-442Therefore, nasal cromolyn can be useful in short-term prevention of development of episodic AR symptoms if administered just prior to anticipatedexposure to an allergen not normally present in a patient's homeor work environment. However, there have been no direct comparative trials between intranasal cromolyn and other treat- ments for such use. Cromolyn is reported to have an excellent safety record and has been studied and also reported to be safe in pregnancy. 431,435,443 However, there are a very limited number of cases suggesting the possibility of immediate, possibly IgE-mediated, reactions to disodium cromoglycate.444,445 The treatment effect of intranasal cromolyn in SAR is not robust and some have advocated temporary use of a nasal decongestant while initiating intranasal cromolyn in subjects with near total nasal obstruction.1Intranasal cromolyn was stud- ied and found to have benet in NARES.171A placebo- controlled trial of intranasal cromolyn showed no benet in VMR, although some anecdotal cases suggest benet in isolated individuals with VMR.446Intranasal cromolyn was found to have no benet on Intranasal cromolyn has similar efcacy to treatment of AR. However, intranasal cromolyn in comparison SAR.448Intranasal cromolyn Nasal saline Nasal saline is commonly used as a treatment for rhinitis and rhinosinusitis in both children and adults. Nasal saline can be benecial for moisturizing dry nasal passages and clearing outmucus. The preferred method of delivery\u2014nose spray, bottle,pump, irrigation, or nebulizer; the volume; whether isotonic or hypertonic; and the dose frequency have not been established. The use of topical saline is associated with minimal side effects, such as burning, irritation, and nausea; has low cost; and hasoverall good patient acceptance. 450,451 There is a risk of transmission of bacteria and parasites including development of fatal primary amebic meningoenceph-alitis from using tap water contaminated with Naegleria fowleri. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and FDA recom- mend that if tap water is used to prepare saline for nasal irrigation, water should be boiled for 1 to 5 minutes before cooling anduse. 452,453 A systematic review of studies on nasal sinus irrigation concluded that when performed regularly over a limited period of up to 7 weeks, there was a positive effect on all investigatedoutcome parameters in adults and children with AR. 454A 2018 Cochrane review on saline irrigation for AR concluded that itmay reduce patient-reported disease severity compared with no saline irrigation at up to 3 months in both adults and children with AR. 455However, saline nasal irrigation alone is less effective than INCS alone for AR in children.456,457 Combination therapy Combination therapy is often used in clinical practice either as directed by the physician or by patient self-treatment. Only a few rhinitis therapeutic combinations have been subjected to rigorousstudy. The scientic evidence will be presented, when available, but the AR and NAR treatment algorithms are based on both scientic evidence and expert opinion. The algorithms weredeveloped to assist the clinician in selecting the preferredmonotherapy and determining when to consider specic agents for combination therapy. INCS and INAH combined Recommendation 22 .GRADE:174We suggest that the clini- cian consider the combination of an INCS and an INAH for the initial treatment of moderate/severe nasal symptoms of SAR in patients age >_12 years. Strength of the recommendation: Conditional Certainty of evidence: High Recommendation 23. CBS: We suggest that the clinician consider the combination of an INCS and an INAH for moder-ate/severe SAR and PAR that is resistant to pharmacologic monotherapy. Strength of recommendation: Conditional Certainty of evidence: Moderate Recommendation 24. CBS: We suggest that the clinician consider the combination of an INCS and an INAH for moder-ate/severe NAR that is resistant to pharmacologic monotherapy. Strength of recommendation: Conditional Certainty of evidence: Low DBPC trials in AR have demonstr ated that the combination of an INCS and INAH is more effective at reducing symptoms of AR and has a faster onset of action than the individualcomponents do. 174This has been demonstrated in 5 DBPC trials with a xed combination of intranasal azelastine and >_12 years458-460and 1 DBPC trial showed overJ IMMUNOL VOLUME 146, NUMBER 4DYKEWICZ ET AL 747p l a c e b oi nc h i l d r e n6t o1 1y e a r so l d .461Its superior efcacy in reducing the PM 12 hour-reflective (daytime) total nasal symp- tom score over intranasal fluticasone was also demonstrated over the whole range of a 12-month randomized, open-label trialin patients with chronic rhin itis (PAR and NAR), although no NAR-subgroup analysis was presented. 462A 6-week random- ized trial of 162 patients with NAR demonstrated signicantlygreater ( P< .01) reduction in nasal obstruction score with the combination of an INCS and an INAH compared with mono- therapy with an INCS. 463 However, as reviewed in the 2017 rhinitis GRADE docu- ment,174all these studies were designed to compare the use of combination therapy versus monotherapy as initial treatment of SAR and not as add-on therapy. The JTFPP recognizesthat in clinical practice, in most cases, the combination will be used when monotherapy has failed to relieve symptoms in patients with SAR, PAR, and NAR in all ages for whichthe product has been approved. However, for PAR and NAR,the recommendations are based predominantly on expert opinion. MP29-02 contains a combination of 2 active substances, fluticasone propionate and azelastine. Slightly higher fluticasone area under the curve (AUC) 0-tlast and C maxhave been reported compared with those of commercially available intranasal flutica-sone propionate. 464Of note are the safety data reported from the above-mentioned 12-month trial, with MP29-02 1 spray per nos- tril twice a day, in which 8 of 404 patients were discontinued at 6months, because of an adverse event (3 decreased serum cortisol, 3 cataract, 2 acne) versus 1 of 207 in the commercially available fluticasone group (cataract). 462,465Other additional combination devices, currently not FDA-approved, including those thatcontain different INCS and INAH, have been studied. 466-472 benet of rhinorrhea Recommendation 25. CBS: We suggest that for patients taking an INCS who have persistent rhinorrhea, the clinician may consider the addition of intranasal ipratropium. Strength of the recommendation: Conditional Certainty of evidence: Moderate In patients with rhinorrhea no t fully responsive to INCS therapy, the addition plus more effective than either active agent alone in reducing the average severity and duration of rhinorrhea in ARand NAR. 473 INCS with intranasal decongestant Recommendation 26. CBS: We suggest that patients with persistent nasal congestion unresponsive to an INCS or to an INCS/INAH combination be offered combination therapy withaddition of an intranasal decongestant for up to 4 weeks. Strength of the recommendation: Conditional Certainty of evidence: LowIn PAR and SAR, concurrent administration of INCS and intranasal decongestants provides greater reduction in nasal congestion symptoms and greater improvement in nasal volume than that of an intranasal decongestant alone. 405,406Further- more, the combination tended to reduce nasal congestion faster than the INCS alone. When intranasal decongestant was given along with the intranasal steroid once a day for up to 2 weeks,the development of rhinitis medicamentosa, a concern withintranasal decongestant use as monotherapy, did not occur. 405,406In addition, in a small study where 19 healthy sub- jects received intranasal decongestant for 2 weeks followed of INCS for 3 days, oxymetazoline-induced tachy- phylaxis and rebound reversed by intranasal fluticasone. 474In a 4-week, DBPC trial involving 50 patients chronic rhinitis taking INCS and cetirizine with persistent nasal congestion, the provided signif- icant nasal conge stion without the development of rhinitis medicamentosa.475 Apost hoc analysis demonstrated that the addition of oxymeta- zoline afforded signicantly great er nasal congestion reduction in the AR compared with in the NAR subgroup.475Whereas the combination of an INCS and an INAH remains the preferred and most supported option in patients with AR with persistent symp- toms after monotherapy (see above), it might be reasonable toconsider adding an intranasal decongestant to an intranasal ste- roid for the rst few days of therapy in patients with AR and sig- nicant nasal congestion. At this time, existing evidence is scantand is not sufcient t o support the prolonge d use of the above- mentioned combination. Oral antihistamine with oral decongestant Recommendation 27. CBS: We suggest that for patients with AR and nasal congestion uncontrolled with an oral antihistamine, the clinician consider the addition of pseudoephedrine, when tolerated. (See Recommendation 18.) Strength of recommendation: Conditional Certainty of evidence: Moderate Controlled studies demonstrate that combination of oral antihistamine and oral decongestant is more effective in reducing symptoms of AR, including nasal congestion, than the individual components are,476-478but adverse effects of oral decongestants are a concern. Given the evidence that this com-bination is effective, if this regimen is prescribed, the clinician should take into account the dose -response relationship of the side effect prole for oral decongestants and titrate to the lowesteffective dose. As indicated in Figs 2 and3, pharmacologic op- tions other than an oral antihistamine with an oral decongestant (eg, INCS or INAH) generally are preferred, but the selection touse an oral antihistamine with an oral decongestant may be made in a shared decision-making discussion. As presented in the rhinitis 2008 practice parameter, 409pseudoephedrine is far superior to other however, there are limitedantihistamine-pseud oephedrine combinations (eg, fexofena- dine/pseudoephedrine). If a xed combination is chosen, side effects such as insomnia should be taken into account. If side ef-fects with the xed combination are an issue for the patient, the dose should be adjusted, if possible, or the xed combination stopped and either separate monotherapy products selected toJ ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL OCTOBER 2020748DYKEWICZ ET ALallow for dose titration, or a different therapeutic class of agents chosen (eg, INCS). Intranasal decongestant with intranasal ipratropium There is no published literature on the effect of combination intranasal decongestant with intranasal ipratropium for the treat-ment of AR and therefore no recommendation for or against thiscombination can be made. In 1 short-term study (<10 days), there was no rhinitis medicamentosa or rebound congestion noted with the combination; however, there was no clinically important differencesin ciliary motility and mucociliary clearance observed. 479 Oral antihistamines with oral LTRAs Recommendation 28. CBS: We suggest that for SAR, the clinician not combine the oral LTRA montelukast with an oralantihistamine for symptoms not controlled with an oral antihista- mine. (Also see Recommendation 7.) Strength of recommendation: Conditional Certainty of evidence: Moderate Some studies nd the concomitant use of LTRA with various oral antihistamines provide additive benet in reducing symp-toms and improving QOL in patients with SAR, 301,480-484while others have shown inconclusive or conflicting results, or no benet over individual medications.485,486One study showed pro- phylactic treatment with the combination of montelukast and ce-tirizine together to be more effective than cetirizine alone in preventing symptoms and reducing allergic inflammation. 487 Although some studies nd that the concomitant administra- tion of an oral LTRA and an oral antihistamine can have an additive effect, this approach is usually less efcacious than administering INCS as monotherapy.304,305,309,310The decision to use this combination rather than an intranasal agent should be made following a shared decision-making discussion. As many as 40% of patients with AR have coexisting asthma.301 The combination of montelukast and a second-generation antihis-tamine may protect against seasonal decrease in some measures of lung function (eg, forced expiratory flow at 25% to 75% of forced vital capacity (FEF 25-75) in patients with AR.488However, the combined mediator antagonism of montelukast with cetirizine is less effective than combined intranasal and inhaled corticosteroids in attenuating nasal and bronchial inflammatory markers.489 COMBINATION THERAPIES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN SHOWN TO BE CONVINCINGLY SUPERIOR TOMONOTHERAPYOral antihistamine with INCS Recommendation 29. GRADE:174We recommend that the clinician not prescribe, as initial treatment, a combination of an oral antihistamine and an intranasal steroid in preference to monotherapy with an intranasal steroid in patients >_12 years of age with symptoms of SAR. Strength of the recommendation: Strong Certainty of evidence: Moderate Recommendation 30. CBS: We suggest that the clinician not prescribe the combination of an oral antihistamine and an INCS in preference to monotherapy with an intranasal steroid in all pa- tients with SAR and PAR. Strength of recommendation: ConditionalCertainty of evidence: Very low The evidence, as reviewed in the JTFPP 2017 rhinitis GRADE guideline,174looks at the initial use of monotherapy with an INCS or combination therapy of an INCS and an oral antihistamine forSAR in patients >_12 years of age. 1That review did not nd signif- icant increased symptom relief from the combination compared with relief from INCS monotherapy. There was insufcient evi-dence that looked at add-on therapy. Therefore, the certainty ofevidence is very low for the approach normally taken by clini- cians, which is to add combination therapy when monotherapy fails. Furthermore, there is a very low certainty of evidence thatchildren with SAR and patients with PAR should likewise be pre- scribed INCS monotherapy rather than combination therapy. Oral LTRAs with INCS Recommendation 31. CBS: We suggest against the addition of the oral LTRA montelukast to an INCS for AR, due to the lack of adequate evidence of improved efcacy and concerns for serious neuropsychiatric events from montelukast. (Also see Recommen-dation 7.) Strength of recommendation: Conditional Certainty of evidence: Very low There is no strong evidence to support use of oral LTRA in addition to an INCS. One study found no further benet when an oral LTRAwas added to an INCS for the treatment of AR. 490One study found that montelukast add-on therapy to fluticasone nasalspray is more efcacious in controlling nighttime symptoms but similar in efcacy in controlling total symptom score. 491With very weak evidence, suggesting on one hand a possible benetand on the other no benet, but with concerns for serious neuro-psychiatric events from montelukast, the JTFPP suggests against the use of this combination. AR pharmacologic treatment algorithms In making decisions about selection of therapies for AR, we recommend that a clinician use guidance from an algorithm (see Figs 2 and3) that is based on multiple considerations including rela- tive effectiveness, onset of action, potential for adverse effects, pa-tient preference, cost to patient, symptom severity, and whether a patient has intermittent or persistent AR. The stepwise progression and decision tree is based largely on expert opinion and cannot ac-count for variable patient adherence in real-life experience. This al-gorithm was developed for clinical guidance and should be viewed as suggested, conditional recommendations. The certainty of the evidence for the various decision steps in the algorithm variesfrom being very low to high, based on the evidence for each drug or combination of drugs. The algorithm also considers onset of ac- tion of the various agents. The following section reviews data aboutonset of action of agents used for the treatment of AR. See discus- sion for each drug class or combination of drug classes for detailed review of data considered. AR PHARMACOTHERAPY: ONSET OF ACTION Onset of action for symptom relief may be an important consideration in selection of treatment (see Table VIII ). There are relatively few head-to-head trials that directly compare time to onset of symptom relief from different agents. Typically, datafrom studies using environmental exposure units nd quickerJ ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 146, NUMBER 4DYKEWICZ ET AL 749onset of action than outdoor park challenges do, and traditional eld studies do not measure symptom relief until >_12 hours after commencing treatment.492-494One cannot rely on a clinical trial to give rm estimates of action onset of a specic pharmacologicalclass or product. For patients with mild intermittent symptoms and minimal congestion, oral antihistamines provide symptom re- lief in 1 to 2 hours. When combined with oral pseudoephedrine,nasal congestion can be improved within 30 minutes. Topical de- congestants such as oxymetazoline improve nasal airflow in under 10 minutes, but possible rebound congestion limits long-term useof these medications (this may be mitigated with concomitant use of a nasal steroid). INAH offer a quicker onset of action within 15 minutes along with greater overall efcacy, and intranasal ipra-tropium provides relief of rhinorrhea within 15 minutes. INCSgive the greatest long-term relief for persistent symptoms with peak results taking up to 2 weeks, but signicant improvement can be seen within 2 to 4 hours. When an INAH is added to anINCS, the onset of action is reduced to only 5 minutes, offering almost immediate symptom relief along with long-term control. Montelukast offers similar symptom relief to some oral antihista-mines, but with a much slower onset of action making as needed use unhelpful. While cromolyn may be helpful for preexposure prophylaxis, treatment of current symptoms requires 1 to 2 weeksof treatment 3 to 4 times per day to see a benet. The time to peak symptom relief is even more difcult to discern from the literature. No studies are designed to look at time to maximal symptom relief, and few studies even note whenmaximal relief is achieved. In addition, the studies reviewed for maximal efcacy are a mix of seasonal and perennial studies with different allergens and pollen counts and thus cannot becompared. The only conclusions that can be drawn are thatINCS take at least 2 weeks of regular use to achieve maximal benet, while oral antihistamines are maximally effective within 1 to 8 days. INAH achieve maximal results in 1 day in one study, but incremental gains were seen up to 4 weeks in another. Montelukastprobably achieves peak effectiveness by the second week. The time for onset of action and maximum effect as described inTable VIII 331-333 ,354,436,442,495-519are based on representative studies in SAR with pollen as the allergen, using symptom scores except for ipratropium, which used methacholine and the amount of nasal secretions, and oxymetazoline, turbinate hypertrophy. Pharmacotherapy for NAR Recommendation 32. CBS: We suggest that the clinician offer an INCS as a rst-line therapy for NAR. Strength of the recommendation: Conditional Certainty of evidence: Low to moderate Recommendation 33. CBS: We suggest that the clinician offer an INAH as a rst-line therapy for NAR. Strength of the recommendation: Conditional Certainty of evidence: Very low The effectiveness of INCS has been reported in studies that have involved a large number of patients with NAR,1especially those with NARES.353-355INCS have also been reported to be effective in the treatment of VMR.1,353,356While INCS are gener- ally recommended for treatment of NAR, their efcacy for somesubsets of NAR is uncertain and is less than that which is achieved for AR. 520There is conflicting clinical research on whether in- flammatory NAR responds better to INCS than does noninflam-matory NAR. 521,522A 2019 Cochrane review concluded that itTABLE VIII.

In a recent systemic review, endoscopic vidian neurectomy compared with the traditional transantr al approach was not associated with any long-term sequelae and provided improvement in rhi-norrhea and nasal obstruction for several years following surgery. 531 NAR pharmacologic treatment algorithm As with AR, we recommend that a clinician use guidance from an algorithm (see Figs 4 and5) that is based on multiple consid- erations including relative effectiveness, onset of action, potential for adverse effects, patient preference, symptom severity, andwhether a patient has intermittent or persistent rhinitis. The step-wise progression and decision tree is based largely on expert opinion and cannot account for variable patient adherence in real-life experience. Compared with the evidence for makingtreatment decisions in AR, the evidence for making recommenda- tions for treatment of NAR is generally more limited, and there are fewer treatment options.AIT and AR Recommendation 34. CBS: We suggest that AIT (subcutane- ous or sublingual tablets) be offered through shared decision mak-ing to patients with moderate/severe AR who (1) are not controlled with allergen avoidance and/or pharmacotherapy or (2) choose immunotherapy as the preferred method of treatment (eg, due tothe desire to avoid the adverse effects, costs, or long-term use ofpharmacotherapy), and/or (3) desire the potential benet of immu- notherapy to prevent or reduce the severity of comorbid condi- tions, such as asthma. Strength of recommendation: Conditional Certainty of evidence: Moderate Recommendation 35. CBS: We suggest that AIT (subcutane- ous or sublingual tablets) be considered for patients with controlled mild and moderate asthma with coexisting AR. Strength of recommendation: Conditional Certainty of evidence: Moderate The basis for the preceding consensus statements about AIT is discussed below. Much more detailed discussion and additionalrecommendations about AITare found in recent JTFPP parameterdocuments on AIT. (See allergyparameters.org.) AIT is effective for the treatment of AR. 532-534AIT should be considered for patients with AR who have specic IgE antibodiesto clinically relevant allergens, and its use depends on the degree to which symptoms can be reduced by avoidance and medication, the amount and type of medication required to control symptoms,the adverse effects of medications, and patient preference. 532-534 A high-quality meta-analysis from 2017 reported doubtful evi-dence that AIT can prevent the development of new allergen sen-sitizations (as this could not be conrmed in the sensitivityanalysis); 535however, its short-term potential to reduce the risk for the development of asthma in patients with AR could be conrmed.535 A previous 2013 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality meta-analysis reviewe d 74 references and concluded that allergen SCIT is effective for reducing symptoms of ARand allergic conjunctivitis in adults (high strength of evi- dence). 536Reviewing 60 studies, the investigators concluded that SLIT reduces the symptoms of allergic rhinoconjunctivitisin adults (moderate strength of evidence). 536The 8 studies that indirectly compared SCIT to SLIT in adults showed that SCIT is superior to SLIT for symptom re duction in allergic rhinocon- junctivitis (low head- randomized controlled grass pollen SCIT v ersus tablet SLIT (SLIT-T) showed minor numeric superiority of SCIT over SLIT-T (notsignicant). 537In pediatric studies SCIT was effective in reducing rhinitis symptoms (mod erate strength of evidence) and conjunctivitis symptoms (low strength of evidence) andSLIT reduced rhinoconjuncti vitis symptoms (moderate strength of evidence). 536The overall body of evidence showed that both SCIT and SLIT were safe and effective treatments forA R( m o d e r a t et oh i g hs t r e n g t ho fe v i d e n c e . ) 536 Currently in the United States, there are 4 tablet preparations for SLIT (SLIT-T): a single pollen grass tablet, a 5-grass pollentablet, a ragweed tablet, and a dust mite tablet. Several meta-analyses conclude that SLIT is effective in the treatment of AR and allergic asthma in adults and children and SLIT has been included in the Global Initiative for Asthma treatment algorithmsince 2017. Adverse reactions to SLIT, primarily local oralJ ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 146, NUMBER 4DYKEWICZ ET AL 751mucosal, are very common; systemic reactions are rare; and there have been no reported fatalities due to SLIT.538 The following text is a quotation from the JTFPP's 2017 practice parameter on SLIT: ''Although alternative regimens andpreparations for SLIT have been proposed and may be used off- label in the United States (eg, use of liquid SCIT extract for sublingual delivery or use of specic sublingual drops or othersublingual tablets), these products and formulations do not haveFDA approval at present and have not been systematically studied in a rigorous manner in US populations. Use of such products or formulations as prescribed SLIT therapy is currentlyoff-label, at a practitioner's discretion, and is without recom- mendation for any current particular indication in the US populations. Therefore, off-label use of aqueous SLIT extractsor any other non-FDA approved SLIT formulation is not endorsed.'' 538 No head-to-head trials of SLIT administered via tablets (SLIT- T) and SLIT administered via liquid drops (SLIT-D) have beenconducted and variations among the trials in scoring of symptoms and medication use preclude direct comparisons of treatment effects. 539Four meta-analyses have provided indirect compari- sons.532,540-542The symptom treatment effect was greater for SLIT-T versus SLIT-D in all 4 of the meta-analysis comparisons. The medication use treatment effect of SLIT-T was greater thanthat of SLIT-D in 2 of the comparisons, was less than SLIT-D in 1 comparison, and was comparable to SLIT-D in 1 comparison. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the economic impact of SCIT and SLIT in adults and children with SAR was under- taken by the National Institute for Health Research in the United Kingdom. Economic modeling suggested that, when comparedwith symptomatic treatment, both SCIT and SLIT may becomecost-effective at a threshold of $28,000 to $42,000 per QALYafter 5 to 6 years of treatment. 543In the United States, using a Florida Medicaid claims analysis, SCIT in children and adults conferredsignicant health care cost savings within 3 months of initiating treatment and a 38% lower 18-month mean total health care costs. 544 A systematic review of the safety of SCIT (45 of 74 SCIT studies reported safety data) reviewed that the most common adverse effects, reported by 5% to 58% of patients were mild,local reactions. 536Pooled data, using a variety of grading sys- tems, found that general symptoms (such as headache, fatigue, arthritis) were reported by 44% of patients and that respiratory-related systemic reactions were reported following 15% of the in-jections, a reaction rate far higher than that experienced by most US allergists. 536The same study reported 13 anaphylactic reac- tions, but no deaths.536A recent survey of American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology and American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology members, using the World Allergy Organization's classication system for systemic reac-tions (grades 1-4) found an overall stable systemic reaction rate of 0.1% (grades 1-4), 1 per 1 million allergy injections had grade 4 (most severe) reactions, and 1 fatality per 23.3 million allergyinjections. 545 There is insufcient evidence to determine the efcacy or safety of SCIT in select subpopulations, such as the elderly, pregnant women, racial and ethnic minorities, inner-cityresidents, rural residents, in patients with immunodeciency and autoimmune disorders, and individuals with severe asthma. However, consensus by experts is that there is noabsolute lower or upper age limit for initiation of AIT, thatAIT can be continued but generally not be initiated in pregnancy, and that SCIT can be considered in patients with immunodeciency and autoimmune disorders. 534Certied al- lergists' experience in large groups of such patients hasbeen reported. 546Limited evidence suggests that SCIT may be more benecial in patients with mild asthma than in those with severe asthma.545 In general, the clinical indications for AIT for AR and asthma are similar for adults and c hildren. Studies of children receiving AIT have demonstrated signicant improvement in symptom control for asthma and AR and a reduction in airwayresponsiveness to cat and house dust mite allergens and reduction in pharmacy, outp atient, and total health care costs. 534Discordant data about a decrease in the risk of devel- oping asthma and new sensitizations has already been com- mented on above.533 When clinically indicated, the decision to initiate AIT depends on a number of factors, including but not limited to patient'spreference/acceptability, adherence, medication requirements, response to avoidance measures, and the adverse effects of medications. The risks and benets of administration of AITwith patients who are concurrently taking beta-adrenergic block- ing agents and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and/or have serious underlying medical conditions needs to be as-sessed. 546-548SCIT should be administered in a setting where pro- cedures that can reduce the risk of anaphylaxis are in place and where the prompt recognition and treatment of anaphylaxis isensured. 534The rst dose of SLIT is administered in a clinical setting under medical supervision but is, thereafter, administered by the patient at home. Clinical and physiological improvementcan be demonstrated shortly after the patient reaches a mainte-nance dose. Patients should be evaluated at least every 12 months while receiving AIT. While many patients experience sustained clinicalremission of their allergic disease after discontinuing AIT, others may relapse. A decision about continuation of effective AIT should generally be made after the initial period of 3 to 5 years oftreatment. 549At this point, for an individual patient, the decision to continue or discontinue treatment should be based on the severity of disease, benets sustained from treatment, and conve-nience of treatment. ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE THERAPIES There is a body of literature reporting on the use of alternative medicine in AR. While alternative trials show promise as other optional therapies for AR, they suffer from many limitations.These include the lack of standardized acupuncture protocols, lack of standardized outcome evaluations, methodological de- ciencies, and small trial numbers. These limitations suggest thatthese positive outcomes should be interpreted with caution and that further research is needed before recommending alternative therapies for AR. Acupuncture Recommendation 36. CBS: We cannot make a recommenda- tion for or against the use of acupuncture for the treatment of AR. Strength of recommendation: N/A Certainty of evidence: Ungraded due to lack studies.J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL OCTOBER 2020752DYKEWICZ ET ALDeveloped in China 5000 years ago, acupuncture is among the oldest medical interventions, yet little is known about its mechanism of action. Researchers have postulated alterations in immune or nervous system function with release of endorphinsand changes in inflammatory and regulatory cells and their cytokine proles, but none have been convincingly demonstrated. A 2009 systematic review of randomized trials evaluated theeffectiveness of acupuncture in preventing and treating allergicrhinitis. 550Compared to sham acupuncture, only 1 of 4 SAR trials found acupuncture to be effective for reducing symptoms.550For PAR, 2 of 4 trials demonstrated symptom improvement. The in-vestigators concluded that the evidence for acupuncture is mixed and larger well-controlled studies are needed. A more recent systematic review and meta-analysis of acupuncture for AR treatment included publications in both English and Chinese languages and identied 13 papers (of 174) that met inclusion criteria. 551The studies involved 2365 partici- pants with both SAR and PAR. The control groups includedsham or no acupuncture and outcome measures included nasal symptom scores, relief medication scores, and QOL measures. Compared with control treatment, acupuncture led to signicantreductions in nasal symptoms, intake of relief medications, and sIgE levels. There was a trend in favor of active therapy in amelio- rating QOL measures. Another systematic review evaluated alter-native health practices in both English and Chinese literature and identied 20 (of 1460) trials that met inclusion criteria and involved 2438 participants with AR where alternative health prac-tices were compared with placebo or Western medicine. 552In general, the analysis showed that alternative health practices were superior to placebo and not different from Western medicinein control of symptoms and QOL. A randomized controlled trial with 12 sessions of acupuncture over 4 weeks in Australian patients with SAR showed improve- ments in symptom scores and QOL compared to sham acupunc-ture. 553An accompanying editorial questioned the clinical signicance of these ndings though, as only selected symptom scores of sneezing and itching were improved.554In the largest and highest quality multicenter study, 422 patients allergic to birch and grass were randomized to 12 real or sham acupuncture sessions over 8 weeks. There was an improvement in QOL scoresand antihistamine use, but these did not meet predened levels for clinical signicance. 555Finally, in the largest pediatric study to date, 72 Chinese children were randomized to twice weeklyreal or sham acupuncture for 8 weeks with an improvement insymptom scores but not medication use, IgE levels, or blood or nasal eosinophil levels. 556 In conclusion, the results of acupuncture for AR are mixed, at best modest, and of uncertain clinical importance. However, it is very safe, with no serious adverse results reported in any studies. Herbal medications Recommendation 37. CBS: We cannot make a recommenda- tion for or against the use of specic herbal products for the treat- ment of AR. Strength of recommendation: N/A Certainty of evidence: Ungraded due to lack of adequate studies. One alternative medical therapy is Chinese herbal medicine (CHM), which has been used for centuries to treat nasalsymptoms related to allergic conditions. Studies can be hard tointerpret as they use different products and methodologies, and many are industry-funded. A review of one such CHM, Yu ping feng san, identied 22 randomized controlled trials (of 1244 records) with 2309 participants with AR. 557Control groups included placebo, pharmacotherapy, and the combination of CHM and pharmacotherapy, and the treatment periods ranged from 2 to 8 weeks. Results were limited in the placebo-control tri-als and suggested a trend for benet from CHM in a very smallnumber of studies. When CHM was compared with pharmaco- therapy, there was no superiority of CHM to antihistamines or intranasal steroids. There was also a hint of superiority of CHMwhen used in combination with pharmacotherapy compared with pharmacotherapy alone. Reported adverse events were mild and transient. Another review analyzed CHM in PAR andidentied 7 randomized controlled trials (of 266 studies) including 533 patients treated between 2 weeks and 3 months. 558 Compared with placebo, CHM signicantly reduced nasal symp- toms with a moderate side effect prole that lasted a short time. A 2007 systematic review examined 16 randomized controlled trials with 10 different products and found evidence that Petasites hybridus (butterbur) improves symptoms and QOL comparably with a nonsedating antihistamine.559A proposed mechanism of action for P hybridus is inhibition of the synthesis of cysteinyl leukotrienes by an ingredient, petasin 1, but there is no evidencefor the mechanisms of possible action for other proposed herbal remedies. Studies with Aller-7, a mixture of 7 Indian plants sug- gested improvement in some symptoms, but this was inconsistentacross studies and contradicted in other studies. 559Studies of 3 Chinese herbal preparations showed some positive results in symptom scores; however, in one study only sneezing was signif-icant. 559Furthermore, another study reported that it required 5 weeks of herbal treatment to reach statistical signicance.559 The investigators state there is moderately strong evidence to sup-port the use of butterbur but that for Chinese herbal products in-dependent replication is necessary. 559More recently, a 2012 meta-analysis of 7 trials showed an improvement in symptom scores with traditional CHM,558but in a 2018 meta-analysis of 11 trials, there was improvement in QOL but not in symptom scores.560 The 2012 National Health Interview Survey showed 34% of US adults used complementary health approaches, including herbal medicines, in the previous year.561Physicians need to question patients on their use of these products as they can have toxicityand drug-herb interactions. The National Institutes of Healthhave a webpage devoted to butterbur stating that raw, unprocessed butterbur plant contains pyrrolizidine alkaloids, which can cause liver injury, and recommending that only products certied pyrro-lizidine alkaloids-free should be used. There is potential for allergic reactions to butterbur in patients sensitized to ragweed, chrysanthemums, marigolds, and daisies. 562While butterbur has the most promising data, more studies are needed to demon- strate the efcacy and safety of herbal medicines before we can endorse them. SUBPOPULATIONS WITH RHINITIS Pediatric patients and rhinitis Rhinitis in children shares most of the pathophysiologic, clinical, diagnostic, and therapeutic characteristics observed in adults. The most frequent comorbidities of AR in children areallergic AL 753unusual below 2 years of age. Infectious rhinitis is discussed in the earlier section on that topic. Nonallergic, noninfectious rhinitis in children generally presents with chronic nasal symptoms. In addi- tion to more common symptoms and signs of rhinitis such as nasalobstruction, rhinorrhea (anterior or posterior), sneezing, and itch- ing, children with rhinitis may present with snorting, throat clearing, cough, gaping mouth, eye rubbing, and dark circles un-der the eyes. Physical exam ndings are further reviewed in Table VI. As discussed in the section on differential diagnosis, in infants and young children, nasal congestion or obstruction can result from structural problems, such as cleft palate and AH, or fromfunctional processes, such as laryngopharyngeal reflux. Chronic mucopurulent drainage may suggest infectious rhinosinusitis. Pu- rulent drainage, particularly if unilateral, bloody, or persistent,may result from an intranasal foreign body. The ''allergic march'' is a progressive natural history of atopic disease that may begin in infancy and early childhood with atopic dermatitis and food al-lergy, followed by AR and atopic asthma in older childhoodand adolescence. The therapeutic approach to treating children with rhinitis is similar to that of adults and includes allergen avoidance, AIT inappropriate cases (see Receommendations 34 and 35) for AR, and pharmacotherapy. Most pharmacologic treatments for AR are approved for children down to age 5 years, and many down to age2 years or even younger. Special care must be given to dosage adjustment, adverse effects, and long-term safety. Controlled trials or real-world experience that have examined the compar-ative effectiveness, acceptance, and adherence of medication options are more limited in children than in adults. That said, there are data that adherence to nasal spray use may be a greaterissue in younger children. 564Historically there has been a shift in guidelines from recommending that oral antihistamines generally should be the rst-line agents for treatment of AR in children to a broader approach that positions other agents including INCS asrst-line considerations in shared decision making with patients and families. 565Further discussion of considerations in children for different medication options are discussed within the recom-mendation discussion for each respective drug class. Elderly patients and rhinitis Rhinitis in the elderly may be caused by the same types and subtypes of rhinitis common in other age groups. It occurs in up to30% of the elderly, with >40% of these patients rating theirrhinitis as moderate/severe, and almost 70% experiencing ocular symptoms. 70AR is the most common type of rhinitis in the elderly but is less frequent than its incidence in younger agegroups. In addition to AR, because of the concomitant use of mul- tiple medications in the elderly, drug-induced rhinitis is earlier section on drug-induced rhinitis.) Physiological changes due to aging result in alterations in neural, histologic, mucosal, and olfactory status that have directimpacts on the functioning of the nose. 572While the mechanism for the clear rhinorrhea reported to be the major rhinitis symptom in over 70% of this older population is not fully understood, there appears to be an imbalance of the sympathetic and parasympa-thetic tone, resulting in cholinergic hyperreactivity and excessiverhinorrhea. 573,574On the other hand, aging is also associated with reduced body water content and less effective nasal mucociliary clearance, leading, at times, to thicker mucous secretions, increased postnasal drip, and potentially, to increased respiratoryinfections. 575-578Structural changes due to aging can also reduce nasal cartilage elasticity and tip support that can further interfere with nasal airflow.578Age-related reduced blood flow to the nasal mucosa, basement membrane thickening, and epithelial atrophyhave also been described. 579,580Through a combination of these structural and physiological changes, the elderly are more nasal 578 Therapy for the elderly presenting with hyperactive cholinergic symptoms has not been well studied; however, because of themechanism of action, intranasal ipratropium seems to be a logical intervention. 581Second-generation oral antihistamines, INAH, leukotriene inhibitors, and INCS are effective and well toleratedin the elderly when used for an appropriate indication, butcontrolled data comparing efcacy in this population are lack- ing. 576Sedating antihistamines, secondary to their systemic anti- cholinergic effects, should be avoided in the elderly due to the riskof urinary retention, constipation, delirium, and ocular pressure changes. 582As noted below in the oral antihistamines section, a 2015 US prospective population-based cohort study suggested alink between higher cumulative use of agents with stronger anti- cholinergic effects (including sedating oral antihistamines) and the risk of developing dementia. Rhinitis in pregnancy In summary, since the release of the 2008 rhinitis updated practice parameter,1interval information has become available that raises new safety concerns about use during pregnancy ofintranasal triamcinolone and intranasal decongestants and addi-tional evidence that supports and extends our previous recom- mendation to avoid oral decongestants. However, there is additional information that supports safety in pregnancy ofmost other common medications used for rhinitis. FDA pregnancy classication. Starting in June 2015, the FDA replaced its old pregnancy (A, B,C, X) classication fornewly approved medications with a more narrative discussion in the product information section for risk summary, clinical considerations, and data headers under the pregnancy subsection.Medications approved after June 2001 will be gradually phasedin. Most AR medications were approved prior to this and will retain the old A through X classications. Unfortunately, there is still little high-quality evidence from prospective randomizedtrials supporting the safe use of pharmacologic agents in pregnancy, but we do have some additional information from cohort studies and clinical reviews since our 2008 JTFPP rhinitisupdate. 1 Intranasal corticosteroids. As stated in the 2008 JTFPP rhinitis update,1budesonide carries the old B FDA classication based on the large Swedish birth registries that showed its safety. Other intranasal steroids still have the old C classication, but there is new data supporting the safety of mometasone and fluti-casone during pregnancy. Although most INCS are generallyconsidered safe during pregnancy, an exception is triamcinolone, which was associated with a higher rate of congenital respiratory defects in a large Canadian prospective cohort study, 583although a chance nding cannot be ruled out.J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL OCTOBER 2020754DYKEWICZ ET ALIntranasal antihistamines. There is little data on the safety of INAH in pregnancy. Nasal saline. A randomized study of pregnant women with AR demonstrated that nasal saline lavage is safe and effective, with signicant reduction in rhinitis symptom score, daily antihistamine use, and nasal resistance.584Nasal saline therefore is a good rst- line option. Oral antihistamines. There is further evidence of the fetal safety of antihistamines and as a whole, oral antihistamines still appear to be safe for use in pregnancy. Cetirizine was notassociated with increase rate of major malformations or increase teratogenic risk. 585A study using the UCB Pharma Patient Safety Database up to February 2015 reafrmed the safety of cetirizinein pregnancy. 586A 2013 study using data from a multicenter case-control surveillance program of birth defects in North Amer- ica did not support previously posited associations between anti-histamines, notably diphenhydramine, loratadine, and chlorpheniramine, and major congenital anomalies. 587Lorata- dine does not appear to increase the risk of hypospadias in maleoffspring. 588A 2014 systematic review found the most safety data for loratadine, including that there is no evidence of increased risk of hypospadias.589 Oral and intranasal decongestants. Oral decongestants should be avoided because of the risk for gastroschisis.1The Sloan Birth Defects Study conrmed an association between oral pseudoephedrine and gastroschisis. This same review alsofound an association between topical decongestants such as oxy- metazoline, when used in the rst trimester, with gastroschisis and pyloric stenosis as well as second trimester renal collectingsystem anomalies. In addition, an association between rst-trimester exposure to phenylephrine, an oral decongestant, and endocardial cushion defects was described. 590Epidemiologic studies have identied increased risk of birth defects involvingthe heart, eyes, ears, gut, abdominal wall, and feet when oral de- congestants have been used during the rst trimester of preg- nancy. However, the number of reported cases is very small,considering the fact that up to 7.8% of pregnant women report us- ing oral decongestants. There has been described a possible asso- ciation of gastroschisis with the use of both pseudoephedrine(relative risk, 2.1-3.2) 591,592and phenylpropanolamine (relative risk, 10.0)592during the rst trimester of pregnancy. Pseudoephe- drine use in the rst trimester of pregnancy has also been associ-ated with limb reduction defects. Phenylephrine has also beenassociated with endocardial cushion defects (odds ratio, 8.0), ear defects (odds ratio, 7.8), and pyloric stenosis (odds ratio, 3.2). 590However, a Swedish prospective study looked at the use of these 2 decongestants during early and late pregnancy in 2474 and 1771 women, respectively, and no teratogenic effects were reported.593 The adverse effects of oral decongestants taken during the second and third trimesters appear to be much less compared with the effects during early pregnancy, but caution should beused throughout pregnancy and prolonged use should be avoided. Based on the low or variable benet of using decongestants during pregnancy and the potential catastrophic harm of havinga birth defect, the work group and the JTFPP are making a strong recommendation against their use during the rst trimester of pregnancy, despite the lack of a strong certaintyof the evidence. The JTFPP is not making a recommendation foror against their use during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reflecting the lack of studies reporting catastrophic harm but the remaining low magnitude of benet for their use. The clinician should involve shared decision making with eachpatient when considering the use of oral decongestants during pregnancy. Leukotriene receptor antagonists. Montelukast carries the old B FDA pregnancy classication and has reassuringobservational data mostly from asthma studies. Since the 2008 JTFPP rhinitis update 1was published, a large Danish observa- tional study from 1998 to 2009 found no increased risk ofcongenital malformations with montelukast. There was, how- ever, an association with lower birth weight and gestational age in children and increased preeclampsia and gestationaldiabetes in mothers using montelukast. This may be explained by increased asthma severity in the montelukast group. 594 Other human studies have shown montelukast and other LTRAs (eg, zarlukast) are not associated with increasedrate of major malformations in offspring. 595-597 Allergen immunotherapy. As previously stated, subcu- taneous immunotherapy should not be started in pregnancy, butmay be continued. While no recommendation on SLIT can be made yet, there is one prospective observational study in which 185 pregnant Indian patients were treated with SLIT (newlyinitiated in 24 and continued treatment in 161) with no increase in birth defects seen in 6 years of follow-up. 598 REFERENCES 1.Wallace DV, Dykewicz MS, Bernstein DI, Blessing-Moore J, Cox L, Khan DA, et al.
