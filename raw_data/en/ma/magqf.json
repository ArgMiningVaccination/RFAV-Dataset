Zimmerman, MD, PhD, is an attending physician in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit at Seattle Children's Hospital. He is Professor of Pediatrics and Anesthesiology at the University of Washington School of Medicine. Zimmerman has been chair of the Scientific Advisory Committee for Children's Hospital Clinical Research Center since its inception and is a member of the Steering Committee for the Center for Clinical and Translational Research. He is a charter member of the American College of Critical Care Medicine and is Treasurer of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and is a member of the Executive Committee. With Bradley Fuhrman, Zimmerman is co-editor of the current premier textbook for the field, Pediatric Critical Care, now in its 4th edition. Additionally, Zimmerman serves on the editorial boards for Critical Care Medicine and Pediatric Critical Care Medicine, and is book review editor for both journals. He also provides ad hoc review for a number of other journals. Zimmerman is interested in the disequilibrium between the systemic inammatory response syndrome and compensatory anti-inammatory response syndrome that occurs as an important aspect of pathophysiology in critical illness. He is interested in the integrated role of neurological, endocrinologic and inammatory cross-talk, particularly involving reactive oxygen species and fatty acidderived mediators and their effect on metabolism. Zimmerman was chosen as a charter principal investigator for the recently established Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network. - - Dr.Zimmerman took care of my daughter at the University of Wisconsin he was the med flight physician. That was 24 years ago. We have NEVER forgotten him. Our daughter passed away but it was not that Dr.Zimmerman hadn't tried his best. He was awesome to my wife and I and our son. He was very compassionate to our family during this difficult time. He follows up with his families. We can never thank him enough. I would trust him with my life. DR.ZIMMERMAN IS AWESOME AT WHAT HE DOES. - Dr. Zimmerman was one of the first Seattle Children's Hospital team members to give us hope and reassurance when our daughter Emmerson was brought to the ICU unit in (DKA) Diabetic Ketoacidosis. Her blood Sugar was 1,343 and she was critically ill. We were scared and we had Dr. Zimmerman at the helm of her ship. He guided her back to our family. We will forever be grateful to him and all the staff at Seattle Children's Hospital. Something that sticks in my mind, late into that first day of ICU, was Dr. Zimmerman's shift was over, he left had dinner with his wife and came BACK to see through her progress. He is a rare gem, and Thank GOD he wanted to be a physician, because he is a damn good one !! ~Julie (Seattle Mom of Three) - - Award Name Award Description Awarded By Award Date SEATTLE'S TOP DOCTOR - 2015 Seattle Met Magazine 2015 Executive Committee and Treasurer Society of Critical Care Medicine 2015 SEATTLE'S TOP DOCTOR - 2014 Seattle Metropolitan Magazine 2014 Seattle's Top Doc Seattle Met Magazine 2013 U.S. News and World Report Top Doctor- 2012 U.S. News and World Report Top Doctor- 2012 U.S. News and World Report 2012 Seattle Magazine Top Doctor - 2012 Seattle Magazine Top Doctor - 2012 Seattle Magazine 2012 Strategic Planning Committee, Chair Society of Critical Care Medicine 2012 - 2014 Distinguished Career Award Distinguished Career Award American Academy of Pediatrics 2010 Distinguished Career Award Distinguished Career Award American Academy of Pediatrics, Critical Care Section 2010 - Other Publications - The Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Consensus Conference GroupPediatric Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome: Consensus Recommendations From the Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Consensus Conference. 25647235 Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies, 2015 Feb 2 - Whalen LD, Di Gennaro JL, Irby GA, Yanay O, Zimmerman JJLong-term dexmedetomidine use and safety profile among critically ill children and neonates. 25068249 Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies, 2014 Oct. : 15(8)706-14 - Wong HR, Cvijanovich NZ, Allen GL, Thomas NJ, Freishtat RJ, Anas Checchia PA, Weiss SL, Shanley TP, Bigham MT, Banschbach S, Beckman E, Harmon K, Zimmerman JJCorticosteroids are associated with repression of adaptive immunity gene programs in pediatric septic shock. 24650276 American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine, 2014 Apr 15 : 189(8)940-6 PMCID:PMC4098101 A, Kelsey SF, Wisniewski SR, Multiple Medical Therapies for Pediatric Traumatic Brain Injury WorkgroupDifferences in medical therapy goals for children with severe traumatic brain injury-an international study. 23863819 Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies, 2013 Oct. : 14(8)811-8 - Holubkov R, Casper TC, Harrison R, Willson DF, Nicholson C, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network (CPCCRN)The role of the Data and Safety Monitoring Board in a clinical trial: the CRISIS study. 23392377 Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies, 2013 May : 14(4)374-83 PMCID:PMC3648617 - Anand KJ, Clark AE, Willson Holubkov R, Dean JM, Nicholson CE, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health, Human Development (NICHD) Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network (CPCCRN)Opioid analgesia in mechanically ventilated children: results from the multicenter Measuring Opioid Tolerance Induced by Fentanyl study. 23132396 Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies, 2013 Jan. : 14(1)27-36 PMCID:PMC3581608 - Randolph AG, Vaughn F, Sullivan R, Rubinson L, Thompson BT, Yoon G, Smoot E, Rice TW, Loftis LL, Helfaer M, Doctor A, Paden M, Flori RC, Giuliano JS, Zimmerman J, Uyeki TM, Pediatric Acute Lung Injury and Sepsis Investigator's Network and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ARDS Clinical Trials NetworkCritically ill children during the 2009-2010 influenza pandemic in the United States. 22065262 Pediatrics, 2011 Dec. : 128(6)e1450-8 PMCID:PMC3387899 - Schwartz SM, Anand KJ, Portman MA, Crow S, Nelson DP, Zimmerman JJEndocrinopathies in the cardiac ICU. 23803992 World journal for pediatric & congenital heart surgery, 2011 Jul 1 : 2(3)400-10 - Meert KL, Shear K, Newth CJ, Harrison R, J, J, Donaldson AE, Dean JM, Willson DF, Nicholson C, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research NetworkFollow-up study of complicated grief among parents eighteen months after a child's death in the pediatric intensive care unit. 21281122 Journal of palliative medicine, 2011 Feb.
