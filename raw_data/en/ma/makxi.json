It can be used to aid sedation, manage pain, supplement surgical procedures, or it can be a therapy on its own. By offering our pet patients acupuncture therapy, we aim to release toxins through an alternative, non-medicated method of healing and rehabilitation.

Acupuncture is one of the oldest, most safe forms of therapy still utilized today. When pet acupuncture is performed by a trained therapist, its implementation can help heal pets with side effects being rare and minimal. Most pet owners assume that because acupuncture utilizes needles, it must be painful. In reality, the needles are only noticed by the patient for a quick second when they are first inserted. The initial insertion of the needle is slightly less painful than a vaccination or injection and is followed by a numb tingling. Once the body begins to feel numb and tingly, most patients completely relax or fall asleep. How long is an acupuncture session? The length of each acupuncture session depends upon the issue being treated and the amount of needles that need to be inserted. After insertion, each singular needle must be stimulated in order for the pet to receive full benefit from the therapy; this stimulation can last anywhere from 15 minutes to a full 30 minutes. How frequently does my pet need acupuncture? The scheduling and frequency of acupuncture treatments will vary between patients. At your first appointment, the veterinarian will do an examination on your pet and discuss a unique schedule for your individual pet. Most patients usually receive 1 treatment per week for a period of 4 to 6 weeks. After the patient begins responding to treatment, the regularity of sessions is gradually lessened until treatment is only monthly, quarterly or less.
