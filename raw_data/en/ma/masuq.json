Many years after her death, her daughter Stella faced the samediagnosis. She took up the torch of advocacy and has been running with it ever since. Many runners who carried the Olympic torch on its long jour-ney to the Athens games lastyear publicised important causes- and none more so than Stella Kyriakides, president of Europa Donna, theEuropean breast cancer advocacy organisation.She bore the torch as part of its leg through herhome city of Nicosia, Cyprus, withsupporters, wearing Europa Donna T-shirts,lining the route. It was, she says, symbolic of her own journey as a woman who has experienced breast cancerboth personally and in her family. Her motherwas diagnosed with the disease in the late 1960s,when Kyriakides was a schoolchild - a time, sheadds, when cancer was very much a taboo sub-ject. \"Even now it is still common to see reportsof people losing their fight against the 'terribledisease', and not to see it by name,\" she says. But starting with her mother, and later on in breast cancer awareness campaigns in Cyprus,Kyriakides says openness in society about thedisease has slowly improved. mother andMarc Beishon 4CANCER WORLD JANUARY-FEBRUARY 2005father were well-known people in what is still a small community, and she never tried to hide hercondition,\" she says. \"Right to the end of her life- and she lived with breast cancer for 10 years -she attended functions and got on with things.She was certainly, unknowingly, one of the firstbreast cancer advocates in Cyprus.\" Today, thanks to Kyriakides and other Cypriot women, the country has an activenational Europa Donna forum, while Kyriakideshas become increasingly involved in the organi-sation at European level, first as vice-president,and then president in 2004. She sees EuropaDonna as first and foremost a political, cam-paigning organisation that has done much toshape standards for breast cancer treatment andcare - but still has a huge agenda on its plate. In 2003 the European Parliament passed its first ever disease-specific resolution, laying downa 'gold standard' for pan-European breast cancerdiagnosis, treatment and care. But as Kyriakidessays, major variations in facilities and approach-es among countries - and at regional and hospi-tal level within countries - means that advocatesCoverStory CANCER WORLD JANUARY-FEBRUARY 2005 5\"It's fine to ask for a seat at the table, but your emotion can only get you so far\" ELIGIO PAONI / CONTRASTOCoverStory 6CANCER WORLD JANUARY-FEBRUARY 2005and medical authorities need to engage in a com- plex picture of prioritisation and national 'poli-ticking' if consistent improvements acrossEurope are to be realised. It is an engagement that Kyriakides is well equipped to help lead. Her career to date - her'day job' in other words - is as a child psycholo-gist at the Archbishop Makarios hospital inNicosia. But when she started out in 1979, psy-chology services for adults - let alone children -were virtually non-existent. Over 25 years, shehas helped develop the shift in care of peoplewith mental health problems from institutions tocommunity-based rehabilitation, and set up thefirst child psychiatric department on the island. But first, like many Cypriots of her genera- tion, Kyriakides had to travel abroad to gain auniversity education to establish her credentials.At school, she worked as a volunteer with chil-dren to fulfil her community service require-ment. \"I knew then I wanted to work with chil-dren,\" she says. \"It is fun and fascinating to seehow they grow and develop, and how painfullyhonest they can be.\"Eschewing a family tradition to study law - but with family encouragement - she duly wentto the University of Reading in England to com-plete a degree in psychology, and then toManchester for a Masters in ChildMaladjustment. It was during her Masters thather mother died. \"She was diagnosed with breastcancer when I was 11,\" says Kyriakides. \"I oftenwonder if my choice of psychology is related toliving through the experience of my mother'sbreast cancer during adolescence, and wanting tolearn more about how people function. I do knowI have never regretted studying psychology.\" After her mother's death, she still had to complete her dissertation, which with the sup-port of friends in England she did, and returnedto Cyprus to begin work as a clinical psychologistin the Ministry of Health. \"I was one of the firstpsychologists in Cyprus and a founder of theCyprus Psychological Society - we were consid-ered a strange breed at the time,\" she says. Working in a mental health hospital for a number of years, she and her colleagues alsohelped set up the first rehabilitation programmesAt home with her husbandKikis and her sonsYiannis (centre- right) and Mihalis (centre-left) \"I remember waking up believing it would not be there - but of course it was\"CoverStory CANCER WORLD JANUARY-FEBRUARY 2005 7and community homes for patients - sometimes using their own cars to drive them away frominstitutions. \"I lived through the transition frominstitutionalisation to community mental healthservices. It was wonderfully exciting, but myheart was always in working with children.\" Kyriakides went back to England - this time on a World Health Organization fellowship onchild psychiatry at the Institute of Psychiatry -and then set up a small outpatients clinic forchildren in Cyprus. \"I don't like to call myself apioneer but the child psychiatry departmentwhere I now work was built from plans I held inmy hand. We lobbied hard for this service. Atfirst the department had no psychiatrists, onlyone psychologist - myself - and two nurses. Nowwe have 22 nurses, four child psychiatrists andeight psychologists. I've seen it grow day by day.\" At first, Kyriakides did not expect to encounter the problems she saw while trainingin England, such as child abuse, thinking thatCypriot society was more close knit, with strongfamily ties. \"But there were the same problems,although much more hidden,\" she says, addingthat notification of abuse has now become morecommon since appropriate services have beenin place. Kyriakides and colleagues have also addressed the needs of children with seriousmedical as well as social problems. \"I startedworking on paediatric oncology at a time whenthere was no children's cancer ward - they weregiven a room in the paediatric hospital and some-times left there for months,\" she says. Now thereis a and colleagues areinvolved with diagnosis and care from day one. Again, child cancer has been a taboo subject in Cyprus - and she has had to tread a carefulpathway between protecting the child and thewishes of parents, and a strong belief that chil-dren do have a right to know about their disease.\"Cancer takes children out of their normal jour-ney - out of school, away from peers and affectstheir body image. They need to go through theirtreatment and also be psychologically healthy.\" It is all very important and richly rewarding work that has been a cornerstone of Kyriakides'life - along with marriage and two sons, now 18 and 22. But given her background and experience, what happened in 1996 - when she wasdiagnosed with breast cancer - still came as agreat shock. She wasn't unwell. Like many women, she felt a lump in her beast while showering,although because of her mother's history, she hadalso been having regular check-ups. It was her40th birthday. \"I chose to do what a lot of womendo - nothing. I decided it would go away on itsown. I remember waking up believing it wouldn'tbe there - but of course it was.\" A visit to a doctor followed - but, as a friend, he could not believe it either, and said: forget it.\"Then I was told it was a cyst and had a fine-needle aspiration - but there was no liquid andno one sent anything for biopsy. I visited a sur-geon, who was complacent too. Then I called anoncologist friend in London who said it's proba-bly nothing, but we don't leave palpable lumps inwomen with your history.\" Back with the surgeon, Kyriakides had the lump removed - and a fast biopsy revealed thatshe did have breast cancer. Although she wentthrough some denial, the whole process actuallytook only two weeks, but she involved only herhusband and brother at the time of surgery -\"I regret not telling my children earlier now,\"she says. Determined to be open about her condition after the diagnosis - \"I knew I had to come outwith it immediately\" - she went back to the hos-pital where she worked to see people before fly-ing to England for a course of radiotherapy.\"I could not have disappeared from hospital lifefor months with everyone thinking the worst washappening. But people were frozen - they couldn'tbelieve it was happening to their Stella, whomthey'd known for 15 years.\" Despite her position in the medical world and her mother's breast cancer, there was a hugeamount to learn. \"Having a scientific backgroundenabled me to read a lot of articles and under-stand the options, but to start with I didn't knowwhat 'hormone receptor positive' was, whattamoxifen was, or what a linear accelerator wasand why it was a good idea to spend threeCoverStory 8CANCER WORLD JANUARY-FEBRUARY 2005months in London on that machine and not with the cobalt option at the hospital in Cyprus.\" In short, the doctors were speaking a foreign language of medical jargon - \"I was surprisedhow little information there was in Greek, and Idon't know what I would have done if I hadn'tbeen fluent in English.\" Her treatment was successful - although as she points out, being away from home havingradiotherapy was a lonely time. \"I spent hourswalking in London, and saw so many movies.And I wondered how women in Cyprus withoutmy level of expertise would have coped.\" The seeds of her advocacy role were sown then, but it was to be a couple of years before shestarted. \"I knew from my experience the frustra-tion of women in Cyprus, and didn't have theEuropean experience I have now,\" she says. \"Butfirst I needed to complete my treatment and focuson my family and work. I needed to integrate theexperience into my self and not act emotionally,and wanted people to see me in my professionalrole - not a mixed front - and needed also to pro-tect my family from what had happened.\" Then, with a small group of other Cypriot women, Kyriakides formed a breast cancerawareness movement. Some 20,000 signatureswere collected and presented to the country'spresident - \"We stood in supermarkets and onthe streets\" - with the aim of lobbying for anational breast cancer policy. \"I'd been reading a lot about standards of excellence and what we needed to do to improvetreatment,\" she says. \"It was also about makingpeople aware that the disease can be treated veryeffectively if you have early diagnosis and goodcare. And the message was that it affects us all -we found sponsors for advertising that actuallyused the words 'breast cancer'.\" After also givingmedia interviews, Kyriakides is now well knownin Cyprus for her advocacy work. At this time, the island was building its firstoncology centre, and one of the consultants on the project encouraged Kyriakides to find outmore about European work, in particular EuropaDonna. So in 1998 she flew to the 1st EuropeanBreast Cancer Conference in Florence, whereshe encountered reality and shock - talks fromdoctors, for example, about five-year and seven-year survival rates. \"I had thought: two years onand I'm cured,\" she says. But there were also women standing up and asking questions, and of course the presence ofEuropa Donna, which has been one of the threepartners behind each of the two-yearly EuropeanBreast Cancer conferences - the co-partners arethe European Society of Mastology (EUSOMA)and the European Organisation for Research andTreatment of Cancer (EORTC). \"Once I'd got hold of my personal feelings I was able to see theimportance of putting over the views of the 'otherside', and wanted to know more about EuropaDonna.\" Kyriakides quickly discovered that Europa Donna has a clear mission as an advocacy organ-isation - turning personal experience into politi-cal expertise, as she puts it - and it was not asupport agency for breast cancer patients andtheir families. \"But at times you need to advocatefor change in order to safeguard basic breastcare,\" she notes, adding that support groups arevery important. But the 10 pan-European goals formulated by Europa Donna in 1994 - which Kyriakidessays remain unaltered today - have certainlyproved to be agents for change, not least in theEuropean Parliament's breast cancer resolution,which is a highly detailed call for minimum stan-dards of screening and treatment, and ambitioustargets \"of creating, by 2008, the conditionsrequired for a 25% reduction in the averagebreast cancer mortality rate in the EU and ofreducing to 5% the disparity between theMember States in the five-year survival rate.\" \"I needed to integrate the experience into my self and not act emotionally\"CoverStory CANCER WORLD JANUARY-FEBRUARY 2005 9As Kyriakides points out, the resolution is just the beginning. Getting national implementation isthe key, and the realities for each of the countriesin Europa Donna can vary from having few orobsolete mammographic machines up to properscreening programmes in dedicated breast units.\"As for the targets, if we come out and say theyare too ambitious we have shot ourselves in thefoot. We are going to try - it's about putting thepressure on at European and national level.\" Objections to the resolution, she says, have come from some authorities in states that feelthe bar has been set too high. \"But the resolutionwas not put together by taking the cr\u00e8me de lacr\u00e8me of two or three healthcare systems - it didtake into account variabilities in Europe, and laiddown the minimum standards for women withbreast cancer.\" Together with other advocates - in particular Karin J\u00f6ns, the Member of theEuropean Parliament (MEP) who wasrapporteur on the resolution (and who is alsopresident of Europa Donna Germany) -Kyriakides says they will not let up the pressure,especially as there has been a large influx of newMEPs after the last round of elections. At a European level, Europa Donna has instigatedan annual training programme to equipadvocates with the skills and knowledge neededto lobby effectively for service improvements.The programme takes 2.5 days - the most recentwas in Milan in November - and comprises apacked agenda of science and communicationstraining and workshops. \"It's a very tight programme. We need to give information about breast cancer as a disease - itsscience and epidemiology - and about how to beeffective as lobbyists,\" says Kyriakides. Thetoughest part of the course for most delegates -and there were 27 at Milan, each from a differ-ent Europa Donna country - is the basic science.\"But if you are an advocate for, say, better screen-ing you need to know about the biology of can-cer,\" she says. \"It's fine to ask for a seat at the table, but your emotion can only get you so far. You're in dangerof being seen as a breast cancer patient talkingabout your personal experience, and that's not thepoint. We have to put forward an educated andresponsible voice. But it takes training and time.\" \"At times you need to advocate for change in order to safeguard basic breast care\" Carrying the torch for breast cancerpatients.Supporters wearingEuropa 10CANCER WORLD JANUARY-FEBRUARY 2005For national service improvements, it is also not enough to know about effective treatments with-out doing a lot of research about the resourcesavailable. Out of the European Parliament's res-olution, Kyriakides says screening is clearly a pri-ority for countries yet to introduce programmes.\"But if you pick up cancer at a very early stageand you don't have the right histopathology andsurgery set up, it may not be effective,\" she says.Likewise, all the machinery in the world makeslittle sense without trained radiographers.Surveys of services are crucial first-line research.At home in Cyprus, a national screening pro-gramme is now in place, but Kyriakides and col-leagues have recently turned to another keyissue. \"Unfortunately, we do see cases of surgerythat women are very unhappy about - it's aPandora's box we had to open and we got the reaction we expected.\" In 2004, Europa Donna in Cyprus went pub- lic with criticism that too many surgeons werecarrying out small numbers of breast cancer sur-gery - and the Surgeon's Association respondedwith a statement along the lines of \"who operateson whom is not a matter for public dialogue.\" \"Women should have a complete picture of their tumour type and the options available,including the type of surgery they require,\" saysKyriakides. \"We have women - not just inCyprus - coming out of surgery with mastec-tomies they may not need. I am an advocate forsurgeons doing a minimum number of newcases, as the Resolution specifies. We haveexcellent surgeons in Cyprus - but too many aredoing breast cancer operations.\" It is a stand-off that surgeons are unlikelyto win in the long run, as Kyriakides says the essential plank of advocacy has been laid -namely they have been collecting outcomes overa number of years. \"When you decide to open upan issue, you must get your facts right.\" The mostdesirable outcome, from her viewpoint, would bethe establishment of one or two dedicated breastunits to handle the relatively small number ofcases in the country (about 300 a year) staffed bymultidisciplinary teams. In a wider context, that Europa Donna has a 'seat at the table' is now a given - its full title,after all, is the European Breast CancerCoalition - and it is also involved at the cuttingedge of research on the global stage. Kyriakidesmentions 'TransBIG', a worldwide translationalresearch consortium run by the BreastInternational Group (BIG); Europa Donna sitson its steering, ethics and spreading of excel-lence committees. \"Our role is to help disseminate information that comes out of trials to women as quickly aspossible,\" she says. \"I think trials are much mis-understood, which is why a lot of women do nottake part. They often think it's a choice betweena placebo or new treatment. We have a bookleton trials in English, which we encouragenational forums to translate into local lan-guages. We certainly want more womenenrolled in trials.\" Breast cancer research and treatments are changing very rapidly, and progress certainly pro-vides another powerful reason for EuropaDonna's work, as all country activists, from thosestruggling to establish basic services up to thosewith well-developed infrastructures, need access \"If we come out and say the targets are too ambitious, we have shot ourselves in the foot\" \"We have excellent surgeons in Cyprus - but too many are doing breast cancer operations\"CoverStory CANCER WORLD JANUARY-FEBRUARY 2005 11to latest information. But it is sometimes said that breast cancer receives more than its fairshare of resources. \"People should realise it is getting the share it should have,\" says Kyriakides. \"There is onenew diagnosis every 2.5 minutes in the EuropeanUnion and a woman loses her life every six min-utes. We should always be top priority on thepolitical agenda. \"I think too that what we have achieved in breast cancer is benefitting other types of cancer.It's not that we will make it more difficult for oth-ers to move on - they will move on with us.\" That breast cancer mainly affects women (fewer men also contract the disease) has beenpart of the reason why advocacy has been suc-cessful, adds Kyriakides. \"I think that women organise themselves more effectively, and breast cancer affects usmainly when we are involved in multiple roles -as a mother, at work. So it has a great impact on society in general - and that means that many men have also become our strongest voices andadvocates.\" She comments that the first breast cancer advocacy groups evolved from the women'smovement in the US - while Europa Donnaitself was initially the idea of famous Italiansurgeon Umberto Veronesi. As the most recent Europa Donna president, Kyriakides' main concern is to maintain themomentum that organisation has generated, andshe feels a great responsibility for advocacy work,especially as a representative at European Unionlevel. A personal vision she has is to cater specif-ically for the needs of younger women withbreast cancer, a group she feels face some verydifferent issues from older women. She has also been widely recognised for her advocacy work - in 2001, she was voted Womanof the Year in Cyprus, and was also runner-up as European Woman of the Year. Early last year, shortly after being elected president of Europa Donna, Kyriakides suffered asecond breast cancer, which required moreradical treatment than before. \"People say it musthave been more difficult for you - it was notharder, just different as I knew what questions toask and what to do, and I did not have the feelingsof panic I had then.\" Crucial advice for a womanfacing breast cancer, she adds, is to take your timeand research the options properly. The treatment was short enough for her to resume her work - but for a while she consideredrelinquishing the Presidency, as she was con-cerned she would not be able to effectively fulfilher role. Kyriakides spends the mornings andearly afternoons as a child psychologist, catchingup with e-mails and Europa Donna work lateron. As the current President she has cut downher involvement in the Cyprus forum somewhat. Free time she likes to keep unstructured - \"I like to relax, chat with my sons, walk the dog andpass the time of day. Generally I'm a happy boun-cy person.\" She finds advocacy work tremendously rewarding. \"If someone had said when I hadbreast cancer in 1996 I would be doing this now,I would have said 'no way'. It has brought out apositive and creative side in me I never knew Ihad, and I have also met many wonderful people. \"Someone said in one of our workshops, 'Breast cancer is the best thing that ever hap-pened to me because it made me change my pri-orities,' and I see what she means. I rememberafter my first cancer experience seeing sunflow-ers outside the hospital and thinking how beau-tiful they were - of course, they were always likethat. But you shouldn't have to go through breastcancer to feel like that.\" \"Breast cancer doesn't get more than its fair share. We should always be a top political priority\"Grand Round 14CANCER WORLD JANUARY-FEBRUARY 2005Pregnant women are rarely diagnosed with cancer.The incidence is aroundone case in every 1000pregnancies, but it has been rising for some time, largely dueto the trend towards delaying startinga family. It poses a unique set ofproblems, which vary according to thestage of pregnancy, and the nature,location and stage of the cancer. Treatment that may be essential for the mother may be fatal or highlydamaging to the fetus. Achieving thebest outcome possible in thecircumstances is a real challenge forthe physician. 40 WEEKS: THE BABY 'SS TORY A normal full-term pregnancy lastsaround 40 weeks. It is perfectlynormal for babies to be born up to twoweeks early. Delivery at 36 weeks isunusual, but, while not ideal, isconsidered fairly safe nowadays. In cases of real need, babies can beinduced at 30 weeks in specialist unitsunder the care of expert obstetricians,who use steroids to speed up lungdevelopment. This is not an ideal start in life, andspending weeks in an incubator is alsonot the best start to any mother-childrelationship. Moving the delivery dateany earlier is dangerous and runs ahigh risk of long-term healthconsequences. 40 WEEKS: THE MOTHER 'SS TORY For a woman diagnosed with cancer, waiting 40 weeks for treatment couldbe a death sentence, particularly withhigh-grade, aggressive or metastaticcancers. Even in earlier or more indo-lent cancers, a 40-week delay wouldbe reckless, allowing the cancer theopportunity to develop and spreadinto incurable disease.THE MEDICAL DILEMMA In this situation, there are not manyoptions, and none of them are ideal.One option is to delay the treatmentuntil the child can safely be delivered.This poses a risk to the mother thatmay be hard to quantify. It also meansshe will have to care for a very prema-ture baby while coping with the side-effects of cancer treatment. Thisoption is more viable the lower therisk posed by the cancer and the moreadvanced the pregnancy.A second option is to terminate thepregnancy to allow normal treatmentto go ahead. This may be the safestoption for the mother's health, but willbe unacceptable to some mothers whodo not accept abortion on anygrounds. Leaving the mother withouther baby is a particularly heavy blowgiven that the treatment may make itimpossible for her to have any morechildren. This option is more likely toAnna WagstaffCancer in pregnancy: the cruellest dilemma When a pregnant woman discovers she has cancer, her doctor faces a challenge with few guidelines, and little evidence of optimal treatment. Thewoman faces a cruel dilemma - does she lose the baby to save her life, orrisk her life to try to save the baby?CANCER WORLD JANUARY-FEBRUARY 2005 15Grand Round OWEN FRANKEN / CORBIS / CONTRASTOGrand Round be considered early in pregnancy, when an abortion may be less trau-matic and when the patient wouldotherwise have to wait a particularlylong time for treatment.A third option is to treat the cancer aseffectively as possible while continu-ing the pregnancy and trying to min-imise the risk to the fetus. The troubleis, there is still a lot we do not knowabout those risks.The decision is not helped by difficul-ties in ascertaining how far the cancerhas developed. Some staging tech-niques, such as certain blood tests,cervical cytology and mammography,are unreliable in pregnant womenbecause of changes associated withpregnancy. Others, such as cone biop-sy of the cervix early in pregnancy, CTscans, abdominal X-rays and any formof radionuclide imaging, are danger-ous to the developing fetus. Whileultrasound and MRI can be used assuitable alternatives, checkingwhether the cancer has spread toother organs or bones can be very dif-ficult, and doctors may have to devel-op a treatment plan on the basis of anincomplete picture. WHERE'STHE EVIDENCE ? The treatment of cancer in pregnant women is a grey area within a disci- 16CANCER WORLD JANUARY-FEBRUARY 2005pline that is increasingly dominated by evidence-based medicine built ondata from ever greater numbers ofclinical trials. The extra risk posed bydelaying treatment a couple ofmonths or the dangers to the fetus of,for instance, administering hydroxy-urea in the first trimester are not thestuff of randomised controlled stud-ies. New drugs are coming onto themarket all the time, but there is noinformation about how they are like-ly to affect embryonic or fetal devel-opment. For this sort of informationwe have to rely on case reports, and itis only recently that attempts havebeen made to gather the informationtogether by collecting published casereports and series or by setting up prospective registers.Take radiotherapy. The dangers of radiotherapy to the developingembryo/fetus are relatively wellknown (see box) from studies afterthe bombing of Hiroshima and theChernobyl disaster. While no onewould contemplate delivering radio-therapy to the cervix or abdominalarea during pregnancy, there is noconsensus on the dangers posed byradiotherapy above the diaphragm.Antonella Surbone, who worked as aspecialist in breast cancer andpregnancy at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in NewYork, believes that radiotherapy should not be used at all in breastcancer during pregnancy. SibylleLoibl, from Frankfurt UniversityWomen's Hospital and the German Breast Group, is heading a study intotreatment of breast cancer inpregnant women under the umbrellaof the Breast International Group(BIG), with a view to drawing upinternational guidelines. She is alsostrongly opposed to the use ofradiotherapy during pregnancy, butsays that other experts involved indrawing up the guidelines are moreopen to the possibility. LATE DIAGNOSES Cancer in pregnancy is often detected later because symptoms are masked by other body changes. Engorged breasts make it harder to detect breast cancer, and palpable lumps are often misdiagnosed as blocked milk ducts. Signs of cervical cancer may be misunderstood. One woman was hospitalised twice because of vaginal bleeding, wrongly attributed to complications with the pregnancy.Cervical cancer was diagnosed only after the baby was delivered by caesareansection, by which time it had spread.Midwives and obstetricians must be aware of the need to rule out cancer when pre-sented with these symptoms. RISKS OF RADIOTHERAPY Radiotherapy is contraindicated in pregnancy, although some specialists use it above the diaphragm with abdominal shielding, particularly in later stages of pregnancy.Therapeutic doses of 5000-6000 cGy expose the fetus to 10 cGy in early pregnancyand 200 cGy or more in later pregnancyDoses over 2.5-5 cGy pose a high risk for malformation in early pregnancy. Likely effects From conception to days 9/10 lethalWeeks 2-6 malformation, growth retardation Weeks 12-16 mental and growth retardation, microcephaly Weeks 20/25 to birth sterility, malignancies, genetic defectsCANCER WORLD 2005 Jassem, a oncologist who specialises in bothradiotherapy and medical oncology,believes the risk is relatively small.He argues that \"If you are pregnantand the cancer is located in thesupraclavicular left node, you cansafely radiate the patient above thediaphragm with shielding of theabdomen, even in the first trimester.\"He says that there is a small risk tothe fetus, and he would notrecommend radiotherapy lightly.However, he would consider it as anoption, for instance, in cases of Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma requiringimmediate treatment, if the motherdid not want to abort.These differences are reflected inanalyses of case reports of breast cancer in pregnancy gathered fromthe literature. In some studies themajority of women were treated withradiotherapy, while in othersradiotherapy was never used.When it comes to chemotherapy, thepicture is not much clearer. Giventhat cytotoxic drugs are designed toinhibit cell division, they could beexpected to damage a developingembryo or fetus. Evidence fromlaboratory studies, animal tests andcase reports show high levels ofteratogenicity and fetal deaths formany common drugs delivered in thefirst trimester. The risk levels in thesecond and third trimesters are notwell established for the majority ofdrugs. In the last few years some major studies have indicated that therisk is fairly low for many of the mostcommonly used, including the AVBDregimen (dacarbazine, bleomycine,vincristine therapy for breast cancer.In the absence of robust evidence,many doctors are reluctant to offeropinions on the safety of these treat-ments. This may be good science, butsome patients object that it leavesthem no basis on which to takeimportant personal decisions. Jan G is a young (male) patientactivist from Germany who haschronic myelogenous leukaemia(CML), the same cancer thataffected Megan Smith (see Megan'sstory, p. 21). He runs the websiteleukaemie-online.de, about thecondition, and understands patients'frustration at the lack of information.\"All information is so sensitiveregarding pregnancy, fertility and soon that nobody is prepared to talkabout it nor publish data unless theyare 100% certain. \"However, young patients are facedwith those issues and have to decideon uncertainty.\" He has oftenthought about building a databasewhere patients can publish theirpersonal 'Glivec baby' data, for otheryoung patients to see. \"Even if thedata are neither comparable norstatistically significant, it would bebetter than having no indicative dataat all!\" Grand Round RISKS OF CHEMOTHERAPY Almost all drugs cross the placental barrier to some extent. As chemotherapeutic drugs work by inhibiting cell division, they pose a risk to the developing fetus.Chemotherapy drugs are associated with spontaneous abortion, malformations, ter-atogenesis, mutations, carcinogenesis, organ toxicity and retarded development.1st trimester Damage is more likely to occur in the 1st trimester. The rate of chemotherapy-associ-ated fetal malformation at this stage of development has been estimated at 12.7-17%with single-drug regimens and up to 25% with combination regimens, compared to apopulation rate of 1-3%. Low birth weight occurs in around 40% of cases.2nd and 3rd trimestersMany drugs pose a relatively low risk to the fetus in the 2nd and 3rd trimester. Somedoctors prefer to wait until the development of the central nervous system is complete,around the 16th week.DeliveryIf a baby is delivered within 2 weeks of the last chemotherapy dose there is a risk of aneutropenic baby being born to a neutropenic mother.BreastfeedingBreastfeeding is inadvisable for women who have recently been on chemotherapy.Treatment that may be essential for the mother may be fatal or highly damaging to the fetusGrand Round 18CANCER WORLD JANUARY-FEBRUARY 2005Christina Brenne Trusting her instincts Christina Brenne was pregnant with her second child when she noticed a lump in her breast and mentionedit at a routine check up. Her midwife arranged anappointment with a doctor who told her it was ablocked milk duct. Christina was not convinced, sincethis was different from her previous pregnancy. Thedoctor reluctantly referred her to the breast clinic, butwith a low priority at the back of the queue. After six weeks she phoned to ask about the delay in her appointment. There had been a cancellationand she was called in the following day. They did a pal-pation, a mammogram, an ultrasound examination anda puncture biopsy. The mammogram showed negative. The other two examinations were both positive. She was seven months pregnant when she was told by the breast specialist that she did have cancer.The doctor said he had consulted an obstetrician andhad made up his mind what to do: her baby wouldhave to be delivered at 32 weeks so they could operateon the breast. Sleepless night Shocked and distressed, she spent a sleepless nightbefore ringing the clinic to press for an alternativeplan, but was told that very premature delivery was theonly option. It was only at a chance visit to herGeneral Practitioner over an unrelated problem thatshe learned that operating on pregnant woman wasroutine. She called the clinic, demanded the name of the obstetrician who had supposedly refused the operation,and phoned him. He told her he had never raised objec-tions, and had in fact offered to co-ordinate her care, since the operation would be done by the breast special-ist surgeon at his hospital, which had a special obstetricsunit. He now repeated that offer, which she accepted. She was given a choice between breast conserving surgery and radical mastectomy. She chose mastecto-my, because she was very keen for her child to bebreastfed, and the surgeon had promised that thisoption would avoid the need for chemotherapy. Let down The surgery went well and she was happy to be lookedafter on a postnatal ward, even though the staff werenot experienced in surgical cases. However, it turnedout that she had the most severe form of cancer.Despite earlier promises, she was now told that shewould need to start adjuvant chemotherapy as soon asthe baby was born. Christina felt very let down. She decided to ask for the baby to be induced two weeks early, so shecould use that window to breastfeed. Having original-ly had to fight not to have her baby delivered eightweeks early, she now found that the hospital wasslightly reluctant to induce the child even two weeksearly. Christina wasn't going to give up now. She wonthis battle, and breastfed baby Sissela for 17 days. She gave Sissela a final feed on the hospital bed as needles were being inserted for her first treatment.Christina is now disease free. Sissela is nearing herthird birthday, and her older sister Lovisa is seven.Christina's advice to other women is: \"Think for your-self - is this really what you want? Always get a sec-ond, third or even a fourth opinion.\" The doctor said he had consulted an obstetrician and had already made up his mind what to doCANCER WORLD JANUARY-FEBRUARY 2005 19WHERE IS THE EXPERTISE ? The paucity of evidence on therapy options is not the only problem fordoctors. There is also a very smallbase of expertise - few oncologistscome across more than 20 or 30 ofthese rare cases in their entire career,most will come across far fewer.Surbone says it is important that cli-nicians recognise their own limita-tions, \"If you get such a patient, trynot to handle the case on your own.Refer the patient to a centre wherethey have experience, where theyhave a joint oncology/ObGyn service.\"If this is not possible, a close workingrelationship between the oncologyteam and the obstetrics team is vital.The story of Megan Smith, the CMLpatient treated in Toronto by aleukaemia specialist working with thehead of a high-risk obstetrics unit, isan example of what can be achieved (see p. 21). The story of ChristinaBrenne in Sweden (see p. 18), showswhat can happen when breast cancerspecialists don't work well with obste-tricians - in this case, despite theobstetrician's advice, her specialistinsisted she had no option but a verypremature delivery, because he wouldnot recommend surgery while shewas seven months pregnant.Loibl says that many German doctorsinsist on a very premature delivery inpreference to giving the patient adju-vant chemotherapy, even in latestages of pregnancy. She attributesthis to the fact that breast cancer inGermany is treated by gynaecologists,many of whom do not specialise inoncology and lack expertise inchemotherapy. As well as underliningthe need for breast cancer to be treat-ed by specialists, this illustrates the need for expertise in both obstetricsand oncology in treating a pregnantwoman with cancer. WHERE ARE THE GUIDELINES ? Many physicians would welcomeguidelines to point them in the rightdirection. These are hard to come by,even in breast cancer, the cancermost frequently diagnosed in preg-nancy. The Italian Association ofMedical Oncologists is unusual; itdoes offer guidance on diagnosis, theuse of radiation and chemotherapy,recommended surgical proceduresand the importance of working with amultidisciplinary team. However, nosuch guidelines exist in the UK or theNetherlands - two countries that leadthe field in clinical guidelines. Norhave guidelines yet been drawn up byGrand Round Treating cancer in pregnant women is a grey area in a discipline led by evidence-based medicine OWEN FRANKEN / CORBIS / CONTRASTOGrand Round the European Society of Mastology. Two separate developments may soon change this. Two years ago, NicholasPavlidis of the Ioannina University Hospital in Greece, wrote a paperwith recommendations for the diag-nosis, staging and treatment ofcancers most commonly found inpregnancy and outlining the circum-stances under which a termination ofpregnancy should be recommended.He has now proposed that theGuidelines Task Force of theEuropean Society of MedicalOncology (ESMO), on which he sits,draw up more formal guidelines,despite the lack of randomised stud-ies or meta-analyses. He says thatlevel 3 or 4 guidelines, which havelower standards of evidence, wouldbe a great deal better than nothing.The second new guideline initiative isspearheaded by Loibl at theUniversity of Frankfurt. In October2003, she called an internationalmeeting, involving surgeons, oncolo-gists, radiologists and breast diagnos-tic specialists from MD Anderson inthe US, Guy's & St Thomas's in theUK, the Centro di RiferimentoOncologico in Italy and a number ofGerman centres, to discuss and drawup international guidelines on thediagnosis and treatment of breast 20CANCER WORLD JANUARY-FEBRUARY 2005cancer in pregnant women. Loibl expects these to be finalised and pub-lished early this year.The Frankfurt initiative is also run-ning what is probably the firstprospective study using a standardprotocol for treating cancer in preg-nancy. It involves the use of breastconserving therapy for women diag-nosed with early stage breast cancerafter the first trimester. The standardtreatment in most countries is a radi-cal mastectomy, on the grounds thatbreast conserving surgery has to befollowed by radiotherapy, which is notadvisable in pregnancy. Loibl's teamargues that, given the trend to admin-ister chemotherapy for between 18and 24 weeks, there is no harm donein delaying radiotherapy until thechild can be delivered at 36 weeks,and they expect the results of the trialto prove this. If correct, this wouldestablish one of the first pieces offirm evidence in this area of medi-cine.Publication over the past year or twoof studies bringing together theresults of substantial numbers ofcases treated with a variety of drugs isanother brick in the evidence base.Fedro Peccatori and a team at the European Institute of Oncology arenow setting up a European registry forall patients given chemotherapy dur- ing pregnancy, in order to facilitatethis process. THE MOTHER 'SDILEMMA Lack of evidence, expertise and guide-lines represent the challenge to pro-fessionals. Whatever the state of theevidence, there is also a painfulhuman dilemma for the pregnantwoman, or couple. The three-waychoice between terminating a preg-nancy, accepting treatment that maycause severe damage to the fetus, ordelaying treatment with possibly life-threatening results is one that has tobe made by the patient, not by doc-tors.Each story is different, as shown bythe following examples, which camefrom doctors and patients in Germany,Sweden, the Netherlands, Poland,Greece, Ireland and the UK, in thecourse of researching this article.A woman diagnosed with early stagebreast cancer opted for abortion andimmediate treatment, because shehad two young children dependent onher and was not prepared to take anychances.A woman with three young childrenwas discovered to have a 5-cm lump,eight weeks into her pregnancy. Sheunderwent a radical mastectomy and Patients object that it leaves them with no basis to take decisions of enormous personal importanceThere is no consensus on the dangers posed by radiotherapy above the diaphragmCANCER WORLD JANUARY-FEBRUARY 2005 21Grand Round Waiting for the results was terrorising, but the news was goodMegan Smith Sticking to her convictions Megan Smith was a 22-year-old biology student from Peterborough in Canada when she went to her doctor with suspected appendicitis. He told her she was preg-nant. A minute later he told her that she had some formof leukaemia and she would have to terminate the preg-nancy because she needed treatment right away. He saidthat the drugs would terminate the pregnancy anyway.\"It just isn't worthwhile for you going through that stresslater on.\" Megan and her husband spent two distraught hours in the hospital corridor. \"We didn't know what type ofleukaemia it was; if I was going to be dead within a fewmonths.\" They had always wanted children, and wereopposed to abortion. When they told the doctor theywould not terminate the pregnancy, he said he could nottreat her, and referred her to a specialist oncologist inToronto, two hours drive away. In Toronto things started to improve. The specialist explained the disease, and spelt out the options. Theonly cure, he said, was bone marrow transplant, andchemotherapy, which would probably end her chancesof conceiving again. He too said she needed immediate treatment and that the drugs would be highly likely tobring about a miscarriage. He strongly advised her tothink about an abortion. Megan and her husband took five minutes to decide they wanted to continue the pregnancy. They were wor-ried that the specialist might refuse to treat Megan, asthe first doctor had done. But, once they had made theirdecision, the doctor backed them \"one hundred percent\". The specialist said that delaying treatment risked allowing the disease to accelerate out of control and wouldmake her vulnerable to clotting. He stressed it was theirchoice, but he did not recommend it. He explained therisk the drugs would pose to the fetus, showing them theresults of animal studies, including pictures of the defor-mities induced. They decided to go ahead with treatment. Megan was given an initial high dose of hydroxy-urea to bring her blood count down, followed by the lowestdose possible, to give the fetus the best chance. Searching for information Together with her husband, she searched the Internet to try to quantify the risk they were running. They foundlittle about results in humans, but noted that the dosesused in the animal studies were 50 times higher than shewas receiving, which was reassuring. The oncologist signed her up with the head of the high-risk obstetrics unit in Toronto, at the Mount SinaiHospital, which runs a programme for mothers with dis-eases during pregnancy. The hospitals face one anotheracross the road, and the two doctors worked closelytogether and tried to coordinate appointments so thatMegan would not have to make too many trips toToronto. At around 8 weeks, the specialist got the go- ahead to start Megan on Glivec (imatinib) - permissionwas needed on account of the cost. She was monitoredconstantly by both doctors, but she had to wait until the12th week of pregnancy before it was possible to tell,using ultrasound, whether her fetus had suffered severedamage. She and her husband had decided they wouldagree to an abortion only if the damage was very severe,such as anencephaly. Waiting for the results was \"terror-ising\". But the news was good, they could see signs offour limbs and a good head shape. Blood tests showedno serious genetic defects. Megan and her husbandbegan to relax a bit. On October 3rd, 2004, a healthy boy, Connor Charles Moore, was born, weighing 6 lbs 1 oz (2.75 kg).Following the birth Megan's blood count started to rise again; her Glivec dose was increased, and she is now sta-ble. Megan recognises that their decision to go ahead wascontroversial. She knows of only five instances of babiesborn to women who were on Glivec, but believes they areall healthy children. Now she wants a second child. Grand Round was found to have 20 positive nodes. She was given eight cycles ofchemotherapy, but not until shereached her 3rd trimester.A woman, pregnant with her firstchild, was diagnosed with high-riskbreast cancer. She agreed to an abor-tion to allow immediate intensivetreatment. The cancer was not curedand she deeply regrets losing a childthat could have survived her.A patient was diagnosed with stage 1Bcervical cancer at around 18 weeks.She waited more than three monthsfor treatment and had the child deliv-ered at 32 weeks.A woman was diagnosed with ovariancancer while pregnant. She refusedher gynaecologist's advice for animmediate hysterectomy and evenrefused chemotherapy. She had beentrying to have a baby for 12 yearsbefore she became pregnant. She said:\"I don't care if I die, I'm going to leavemy baby to be raised by my husbandor my mother.\" Not everyone willshare those priorities ... and noteveryone has a husband or motherthey can trust their newborn to.These stories illustrate that there canbe no right or wrong answer. Womenare in different circumstances, withdifferent priorities and facing differentpossible outcomes. Some women saythat the child helps them cope withthe cancer. Others feel that a newbaby is challenging enough for ahealthy woman, and that it may be toomuch for a woman debilitated bycancer therapy and with other youngchildren at home, to care for a very 22CANCER WORLD JANUARY-FEBRUARY 2005premature newborn who may be affected by the treatment.The biggest question is whether or notto continue with the pregnancy. Butthere are other difficult questions too,such as whether to induce pre-termdelivery, or to risk cytotoxic treatment.If either choice is made, how earlyshould action be taken? REACHING A VERDICT David Luesley, gynaecological oncolo-gist at Birmingham Women's Hospitalin the UK, starts consultations by out-lining the extreme possibilities. \"Thebest outcome is a healthy mother anda healthy baby; the worst outcome istwo lives lost.\" If aiming for the firstmeans delaying vital treatment, thereis a risk the mother will die before thefetus is mature enough to survive,resulting in the worst possible out-come. Pavlidis uses what he calls the Golden Rules, when teaching students aboutthe treatment of cancer in pregnancy. 1. You have to benefit the mother's life2. You have to treat curable malignantdisease3. You must protect the fetus fromharmful effects4. You must try to keep the woman'sreproductive system intactThese imperatives represent, he says,an order of priority \"drawn from thedaily practice of a doctor's life.\" Heemphasises, however, that it is ulti-mately the patient's priorities that takeprecedence.In this situation there are rarely goodoptions, just a choice between badones. Some doctors have ethical objections to abortion. Some mayhave an ethical objection to adminis-tering drugs to a pregnant woman,when there is a potentially high risk ofsevere damage to a fetus. Many arenot happy about delaying urgent treat-ment for a patient at high risk. A doctor who wishes to do best by hisor her patient has to put personal pref-erences and convictions to one sideand focus instead on helping thewoman reach a decision that bestreflects her own priorities. Helping women to make that choicedemands absolute honesty. Luesleysays that breaking bad news to a preg-nant woman is one of the hardestthings a doctor has to do, and hewarns against glossing over stark reali-ties. He cites the example of a preg-nant woman with ovarian cancerchoosing between radical hysterecto-my and chemotherapy. \"You have to beclear about the likelihood of response- between 60% and 80% show aresponse, but a proportion relapse,and can do so quickly.\"Surbone points out that you are ask-ing a woman, at a time when she isvery scared and vulnerable, to make adecision about the life of her childversus her own life versus her respon-sibility to this child. \"She has to thinkabout surgery and/or chemotherapy.She has to think about the practicalimplications, and about her relation-ship with her husband after a possi-ble mastectomy. Added to all this, shenow has to think about a child whocould possibly grow up without her.\" Physicians would welcome guidelines to refer to - but they are hard to come byCANCER WORLD JANUARY-FEBRUARY 2005 23The question is, says Surbone, whether you feel your role as a doctoris purely to provide the best informa-tion, and that offering any advice is anabuse of power, or whether, whilerespecting the patient's autonomy, youfeel your responsibility as the expert isto offer advice in their best interest. She herself tends to the latter view. \"Ifirst inform my patients fully. But ifthey ask me: What do you think Ishould do? I give my opinion, whichdepends on the case. But I always say'This is my opinion as a physician.I'm not you, and however I try to putmyself in your position I may never understand your values, and I maynot share them.'\"She points out that, as the doctor, youare the expert who has the informa-tion and holds the key to the varioustreatment options, and you are theone who is under the least pressure.In practice, the way you present theinformation will influence what thepatient decides.Few situations test a doctor's ability to serve the sick as much as this one.

Rather the opposite -massage, relaxation, aromatherapyand reflexology are particularly usefulin improving quality of life and canease the adverse effect of orthodoxcancer therapies.\"It is the herbal and other treatmentswith a pharmacological effect thatworry doctors the most. \"In Chineseherbal medicine, where treatment is Mary RiceLet's talk Chinese milk vetch 'Quack remedies' have long been a thorn in the side of the medical establishment, but fear of ridicule means many patients don't tell their doctors about any additional medicines theymay be using.

Studiesshow that those who use CAMs tendto be better educated, of highersocio-economic status, female, andyounger than those who do not. \"Canyou imagine a 70-year-old sociallydeprived man with lung cancertaking relaxation classes?\" he asks.One thing they do agree on is that weneed to find out more about howwidely these therapies are used incancer patients and what effect thisis having on trials of new agents.Ernst suggests that people enteringcancer clinical trials should be toldnot to take herbal remedies of anykind without disclosing them to theinvestigators. \"Carrying on takingCAM against the advice of theinvestigators could be an exclusioncriterion,\" he says. \"It would beinteresting to do this in a large studyand see how many people drop out.Although we have a pretty good ideaabout the prevalence of use, we don'tyet know how many would chooseCAM over conventional treatment ifthey were asked to make a decisionto use only one. My view is thatadherence to, for example, Chineseherbal medicine would be less thanthat to drug treatment, but this needsto be tested.\"One of the biggest problems is the amount of misleading informationabout CAMs that patients are likelyto come across on the Internet.Helping patients judge the quality ofa website by suggesting what to lookfor is an important task for healthcareproviders, says Ernst, adding that\"here again it could produce usefuldata - it would be valuable to knowthe numbers of cancer patients whouse information from such sites orbuy CAMs for cancer online.\"But patients desperate for a cure canonly work with the information theyhave, and at the moment there isprecious little authoritative evidence-based information available to them- or their doctors. This is a problemthe European Organisation forResearch and Treatment of Cancerhas recently started to address. It hassecured funding from the EuropeanCommission for a study looking forevidence-based information onCAM. With partners in manyEuropean countries, the informationgained will be disseminated widelythrough the Internet and via cancerleagues and patient groups.The combined effect of helpingpatients be more discriminatingabout the information they trust, andincreasing the availability of morereliable evidence-based informationon CAMs should go a long waytowards helping takeinformed decisions. But Ernstaccepts that CAMs may have anappeal beyond what the evidencemerits. \"What cancer patients wantis a cure, and we are not providingthis. Even though they know that there is no evidence that Chineseherbal medicine, for example, willcure their disease, people stillcontinue to take it. What they maynot realise is that if an effective CAMtreatment emerged it would instantlybe taken up by mainstream medicine,as happened with Taxol [paclitaxel],for example.\"One thing patients clearly do realise,however, is that they risk being madeto feel foolish and gullible if they telltheir doctors about the CAMs theyare using. This is a problem for thedoctors trying to treat them, and forresearchers trying to interpret theresults of clinical trials. McViebelieves what is required is a changeof attitude among the medicalprofession.\"Giving patients the feeling that theyhave a real role to play and are notjust there to be guinea-pigs insomeone else's investigation is themost important change to be made,\"he says. \"Using CAM is a way oftaking back a bit of control over theirbodies. Doctors should be aware ofthe widespread use of such therapiesand not feel that they can simply telltheir patients not to use them. It'sabsolutely essential that doctorsunderstand this and avoid beingsuperior and disapproving. Thepatient needs to feel sufficientlyconfident to be honest about exactlywhat he or she is taking. Clearly ifparents don't feel confident in tellingthe doctor what they are giving theirchildren, something has gone verywrong.\" It would be astonishing if there were not some major reactions with investigational agentsMaster piece Sophie Foss\u00e5: The survival expert Choosing a career as a urologist in Norway was always going to be a tough option for a German woman in the 1960s, and she often felt isolated and unwelcome. But Sophie Foss\u00e5'soutstanding work as a researcher gained her recognition, and eventually gave her theconfidence to look beyond the purely medical needs of her patients. Sophie Foss\u00e5 is one of the most deco- rated oncologists in Norway, recog-nised internationally for her work ontesticular cancer and with cancer sur-vivors, a popular visiting Professor at the European School of Oncology, and a proudwife and mother. For someone at the top of hertree, she did not have a promising start. She was born at the wrong time to parents whose politics were confounded and discredited.Two successive generations of her family had seen their aspirations shattered, and learningbecame the only treasure the growing Sophiecould trust. As a young doctor she fell into oncology by default, in a country where she was regardedwith suspicion. Moreover, her focus was on sci-ence, rather than patients. As she grew moreconfident and happier, her attitude changed. Herresearch became less about tumours and moreabout people. Her consultations became morediscursive. She thinks deeply about her patients and about the next generation of oncologists. She hasPeter McIntyre 28CANCER WORLD JANUARY-FEBRUARY 2005even learned to unwind a little, albeit she still works hours that make her colleagues flinch. Shewould like to be a better grandmother, but not yet.Her legacy will be in understanding the effects ofcancer and treatment on those who survive. BORN INTO NAZIGERMANY Sophie Gericke was born in Germany in 1941.Her mother's family had escaped revolutionaryRussia where her grandfather was secretary tothe Czar. Many of her relatives had been shot. Driven by fear of Stalin's Russia, her school teacher mother became a patriotic German and amember of Hitler's National Socialists. Her fatherwas a soldier and a convinced Nazi. By the timeof Sophie's birth, her mother was having secondthoughts, and in 1942 she left the Party, an act ofsome courage. Although both parents survivedthe war, their marriage did not and in 1945 theydivorced. Sophie's early memories are of dream-ing that the Russians were coming to kill her. Her multilingual mother got a job translating for the British army, which allowed Sophie, herbrother and two sisters to eat in the militaryMaster piece CANCER WORLD JANUARY-FEBRUARY 2005 29kitchen. Amidst the ruin of post-war Germany they were able to survive. \"We were very poor. My grandmother and mother taught us that you can lose everything inthis world except what you have learned -nobody can take your knowledge from you. Soour home was based on intellectual things.\" Hermother translated English and Russian stories forthe children to read. Sophie's ambition was to be a professor. Aged 17, she went to M\u00fcnster University and then toBonn. She fell in love with a Norwegian medicalstudent Jon Foss\u00e5, the child of a poor farmer. Shereturned to M\u00fcnster to take her final exams andat the age of 23 qualified as a doctor. Sophie andJon married one week before they left for Norway.A GERMAN IN NORWAY \"Being German in Norway in 1964 was a prob-lem, and the war again became important. WhenI came to Norway no one could accept anythingpositive about Germany, even people who knewthat I was nothing like a National Socialist.\" Her first job was in psychiatry, with troubled adolescents. She took the job because it camewith a flat, and had regular hours, which her hus-band, by now an orthopaedic surgeon, did not.\"We wanted six children and we realised that ifhe was on duty every third night and I did thesame, it would be quite impossible. When Icame down from University - I knew about dis-eases. Now I learned that other things wereimportant.\" In 1968 she changed direction. Feeling it was impossible to follow her first option of internalmedicine, she chose oncology as second best,and moved to the Norske Radium Hospital(NRH) in Oslo. \"Lots of people warned me not \"The urologists even wrote a letter of protest to my chief that I was a woman, and this was a male cancer\"Master piece 30CANCER WORLD JANUARY-FEBRUARY 2005to do oncology. They said it is so depressing. But this was a way I could have children and manage.It was a practical decision.\" After post-graduatetraining she began to specialise in urological can-cer - the only specialty nobody had reserved.Bladder cancer was treated by urologists andtreatment was not up to date. \"The NRH had not much contact with inter- national colleagues, at least not for urologicalcancer. Chemotherapy was not used for bladdercancer. I had to find my own way and I found itthrough the European Organisation for Researchand Treatment of Cancer (EORTC). I learnedabout new drugs and new ways to treat this can-cer. It took a long time before my hospitalaccepted that I could introduce them. \"The urologists even wrote a letter of protest to my chief that I was a woman, and this was amale cancer, and I was a foreigner and not anurologist. I understood that the only way to con-vince them was to publish and look for supportin other countries.\" She did her doctorial thesis on the study of DNA in bladder cancer using cytophotometry.She worked alone, without supervision, at nightafter finishing her day's shift. Despite having ayoung family, she went to the hospital at 5 am fortwo hours before going swimming with her chil-dren and then going back to work. Professionallyshe felt isolated and unwanted. \"At one time I really thought about suicide, they went so much against me. Norway and theScandinavian countries had a different way oflife. They prioritised their leisure time. Theywanted to go skiing or sailing. Very few peoplereally understand that I still think it is fun to doresearch and to publish.\" She was increasingly beguiled by her work. \"I saw the research as compensation. I will confessthat in the first ten years I was probably not the bestdoctor for my patients. I saw the medical problem,not the human problem.\" The father of one youngman, wrote: \"She is probably a good researcher, but she will never become a good doctor.\" In the late 1970s and 1980s the awards for research began to flow, including four from theNorwegian Urological Association. She became aconsultant in 1982 and achieved her childhoodambition in 1993, when she was appointedProfessor. It is a title she discourages her juniorcolleagues from using. \"I am quite an ordinaryperson. I don't take myself very seriously.\" Foss\u00e5 took an increasing interest in testicular cancer, where treatment was improving througha combination of surgery, radiotherapy andchemotherapy, especially with the introductionof cisplatin. Confident in her ability to cure theseyoung men, Foss\u00e5 became interested in theirother concerns. \"The patient is scared, but in the back of their mind they wonder, 'If I survive, what kind ofman will I be? Will I be able to father children?'I say to these young boys, 'I know that you thinkabout it, so let's talk about it.' The patient will nottalk about fertility and sexuality unless I raise it. \"I think young men feel secure and safe when they come to me. Most patients look at meas a kind of mother at this time.\" She kept pictures of her four growing sons on display in her consulting room to reassure theyoung men. \"They knew they would get treat-ment as good as in the Royal Marsden in Londonor in America. I take a lot of time to talk to them.They have their teddies in their bed and are likechildren again. Our staff and nurses understandtheir problems and take care of them.\" She introduced a sperm bank 20 years ago. Of the 400 patients who deposited frozen sperm,only 30 have used it, as most fathered children inthe usual way. SURVIVOR WORK In 2001, Foss\u00e5 opened a long-term cancersurvivorship unit at the NRH. \"I started with\"I say to these young boys, I know that you think about it, so let's talk about it\"Master piece CANCER WORLD JANUARY-FEBRUARY 2005 31When she received the H.M. King Olav's Research Award, Sophie Foss\u00e5 knew she was truly accepted Master piece 32CANCER WORLD JANUARY-FEBRUARY 2005testicular cancer patients because I had treated them for 30 years and I wanted to know the long-term effects. I also explore the mental side. Ithink it is very important to see what problemscancer survivors have to cope with due to the dis-ease and their treatment. \"We have done a long-term study of 1,400 tes- ticular cancer survivors in Norway. The quality oflife for testicular cancer survivors is as good as therest of the Norwegian male population. Sexualityis also the same. There is no difference.\" She did, however, find other problems. In 2002 she published a paper in the Annals of Oncology showing that 20-30% of men who had been successfully treated for testicular cancer inthe 1980s had decreased kidney function. In2004, Foss\u00e5 spent several months at the NationalCancer Institute in the US reviewing a largenumber of testicular cancer cases. \"We knowthat by giving treatment to these young men we induce new cancers after 20 years. We want to know what kind of cancers we induce after whatkind of treatment. I would today be very reluc-tant to give radiotherapy to testicular cancerpatients, which has been a routine treatment. \"I also tell the patient that they may have problems with obesity, blood pressure andcholesterol. They can do a lot through lifestylefactors and physical activity, if they know aboutthe higher risk.\" Her work on prostate cancer also demanded a human approach. \"I saw patients on whom theurologists had given up. I had to understand thatthey only had a few months left and help them toget the best out of it. I am very clear and do nothide the prognosis. I think they have the right toknow if they will die, to do the practical thingsthey have to do. As I became older it was easierto talk about these things with my patients.\" Foss\u00e5 opposed moves for routine prostate screening. \"The urologists wanted the PSA testfor all men over the age of 50. I said that there was no scientific evidence that this would helpsurvival. The urologists did not like that verymuch. Today, they understand that it was a gooddecision.\" The Norwegian Urological CancerGroup refused to recommend that Norway takepart in the European Randomized Study ofScreening for Prostate Cancer trial. Foss\u00e5 was gratified to read in October 2004 that Thomas Stamey, who developed the PSAtest, now believes that it is overused. She is hopeful that Taxotere (docetaxel) may be the first in a line of new drugs to prolong lifein prostate cancer patients with metastases. Butfor those at an earlier stage of the disease thereare unresolved dilemmas. \"Surgeons have become much better. But they do not operate so many cases as they did.They are very selective. The problem of urinaryincontinence has decreased very much. Impotence is still a large problem. Radiotherapy also gives a high chance of impotence.\" So what advice does she give? \"You have to sit down with a man and tell him all the side-effectsthat can be expected. It is very difficult for mento live with the idea that they have cancer but donot get treatment. Quite often he asks 'Whatwould you do, if it was your husband?' I say, 'Myhusband is my husband and you are you. I wouldsay that this or that option is best for you, but youhave to decide.' Most patients want the doctor totake the responsibility, and of course we cannot.The most important thing is to find a doctor youtrust and who follows the latest developments.\" Foss\u00e5 also sees patients with cancer of the kidney, and was one of the first in Norway touse interferon to stimulate the immune system.However, there is no effective curativetreatment and no cytotoxic drugs that killcancer cells in the kidney. \"When I started my medical education only \"I would today be very reluctant to give radiotherapy to testicular cancer patients\"Master piece CANCER WORLD JANUARY-FEBRUARY 2005 33a cure was important, but this is not true.

Her only wish is to die in peace with-out giving trouble to her daughter and family.\" \"We tell our patients very honestly whether we go for curative treatment or palliative treatment. Itis essential for a good doctor patient relationshipthat both know what is possible and what is not.\" RESEARCH AND PRACTICE Foss\u00e5 does not see much distinction between research and clinical practice. \"Every treatment Igive, I do it as systematically as possible in orderto be able to use it for research. And I always askmyself, how can I use what I learned in researchon the next patient?\" Her long-term survivors' unit is expanding. Foss\u00e5 sees 10 women a month who have breast cancer. She will also, over the next two years,include patients who had Hodgkin's lymphoma.\"I want this long-term outcomes unit to flourishand become a national centre of competence.\" Her other remaining ambition is to teach and to help young doctors. She supervises a numberof PhD students and lectures. \"My childrenthink I should spend more time being a grand-mother, and they probably are right. But I havemy life and I am invited to conferences. Mydaughter in law called me to see if I could baby-sit. I said I can't come, I am in the USA.\" In 2001 she organised a meeting in Moscow on testicular cancer, which proved highly emo-tional for her. \"I was very happy to be in Russia.I feel a special link. I closed the conference with a picture of my mother.\" Despite starting work daily at 4 am, she claims she is learning to relax. \"I only work fivedays a week, not Saturday or Sunday! A few yearsago, I learned downhill skiing, which was anadventure. The first time I went on the ski-lift, itcaught my anorak and went up with me hangingfrom it. I fell to the ground. I told myself that if Idid not try again, I would never do it. So I learneddownhill skiing and I now love it. It showed methat even at my age I can do things that I neverthought I could do.\" Two of her four sons are doctors, and one, Alexander, is an oncologist at the Norske RadiumHospital, working on Hodgkin's disease. Herchildren speak German and Norwegian. One sonbecame a German citizen, married a German girland lives in Norway. Another married a Finnishgirl and lives in Germany. A third married anEnglish girl and lives in London. \"We are a veryinternational family.\" When, in 1997, she received H.M. King Olav's Research Award, Sophie Foss\u00e5 knew shewas truly accepted. \"It was very nice to get anaward at the castle. I feel Norwegian, but aNorwegian European. I do not like nationalism,but you have to have somewhere you feel athome. For me that is Norway. When I was firsthere, there was always some restriction in myheart. I knew that Germans were the reason formany young Norwegian deaths. By engaging withtesticular cancer, and especially fertility prob-lems, I have assisted many young Norwegians tobe alive. It gives me some comfort.\" Foss\u00e5 was gratified to read that the man who developed the PSA test now believes it is overused\"Quite often a patient asks 'What would you do, if it was your husband?'\"InsideTrack Show me the evidence How Else Borst-Eilers got the best out of a shrinking health budget Haematologist Else Borst Eilers was handed a poisoned chalice as the Minister asked to make cuts in healthcare costs in the Netherlands. She found her salvation in the patientviewpoint, and evidence-based care. Else Borst Eilers' first task, on becom- ing minister for Health, Welfare andSport in the Dutch coalition govern-ment in 1994, was to cut publichealth spending. A medic by training, this was hardly the role she had envisaged whenshe stepped into public life. But if the job had tobe done, then Dutch patients could be gratefulthat her hand was on the scalpel. All over Europe, similar scenarios were being played out as two decades of spiralling public healthcosts combined with sluggish economies forcedgovernments to ration health care. New accountingand budgeting systems obliged hospitals, specialistunits and primary care providers to cut spending,but where and how the cuts were made was all toooften the outcome of a battle between institutionsand professionals defending their own territories. Els Borst shared with most of her fellow European health ministers a desire to see thebest possible health service for the money avail-able. What gave her the edge was not so muchher medical background as her work over twodecades in asserting the interests of patient careover the conflicting pressures from the medicalprofession and the accountants.Anna Wagstaff 36CANCER WORLD JANUARY-FEBRUARY 2005SOFT-SPOKEN Borst is a slightly built soft-spoken mother ofthree, who chose not to work full time until herchildren were school age. A haematologist, spe-cialising in blood transfusion, her career didn'tproperly begin until she was \"between 35 and 40\".While working in the department of haematologyin Utrecht University Hospital she had her first,reluctant, taste of power. The medical directorwas ill. As head of the hospital's blood bank, ElsBorst was one of the few department heads on thehospital, rather than the university, pay roll. So shetook on some of the director's responsibilities. Like most hospitals at that time, the board of directors consisted of one person with medical train-ing (the medical director), a nurse, and someonewith a background in economics or administration. \"At first I hated it, but after some time I thought ... well you can influence things here inthis position. Everybody in a hospital is criticalabout how it is run. Everybody knows how to doit better. And then you are suddenly in a positionwhere you can really make a change.\" This marked the beginning of Els Borst's career in health policy, and it didn't take long forUtrecht University Hospital to start to feel theInsideTrack CANCER WORLD JANUARY-FEBRUARY 2005 37\"From time to time, it is necessary to leave your bunker and enter the political arena\" InsideTrack 38CANCER WORLD JANUARY-FEBRUARY 2005effects. Departments that were dynamic and innovative - including radiotherapy and haemo-oncology - found themselves with a greatershare of the budget to fund pioneering researchand trials. And strange things started happeningto new appointments. Appointing new heads ofdepartment had traditionally been the domain ofthe university, but Els Borst argued that aca-demics may not always be the best choice to runhospital departments. She overcame heavyresistance to win the right to sit on appointmentpanels, and Utrecht University Hospital becamethe first in the Netherlands to separate theheads of academic and hospital departments. If an academic candidate could lead a clini- cal team, then the posts could still be combined.\"I remember appointing the head of the neurolo-gy department. He had only published six papersin his life. He was an excellent teacher and a verygood clinician, and he is still working there andis a very great success.\" But not everyone was happy. \"Many people wanted to have it all. They wanted all the power.To be top in research and top in the clinic. It was men more than women who complained - someof them want all the power they can get.\"THE PATIENTS ' STANDPOINT At the time she would probably have phrasedthis more diplomatically, because, as she says,somehow you have to keep medical staff on side.\"If you are in permanent battle with your medicalstaff - which you often see in hospitals - you getnowhere.\" Her secret was always to argue her case from the standpoint of the patient. \"It is not a questionof making everything as cheap as possible, buthow to make healthcare as good as we can.\" Andthis, she argued, meant setting priorities andworking more efficiently. \"If you let all those pro-fessors have their way, they would all have theirown CT scanners, and that is not efficient.\" Over a period of 10 years as medical director in Utrecht, Els Borst developed a great interestin how to evaluate efficiency within the healthsystem. This was a field that was just beginningto emerge in a variety of forms in a number ofcountries. Foremost among them was the guidelines movement, which started in the early 1980s in theUS, and spread rapidly to Europe. Researchers inthe US had been shocked to discover huge differ-ences in rates of treatment. Most notoriously, With Queen Beatrix after a visitto the Kuria WORLD JANUARY-FEBRUARY 2005 39some doctors were five times more likely to per- form a hysterectomy than others. The medical profession suddenly found itself open to public scrutiny, as governments andhealth insurance providers called for guidelines.In the beginning these were drawn up throughconsensus. \"You put ten cardiologists in a roomand let them meet a few times, and they woulddraw up guidelines for instance for coronarybypass surgery.\" But this method soon provedunsatisfactory and was replaced by evidence-based guidelines. \"You say: 'Where does it work? How can you differentiate patients who will benefit from thosewho will not?' Consensus is all very nice, but ifyou have 10 cardiologists who all love interven-tion, they will draw up guidelines that include amuch wider range of patients than if you lookcritically at the evidence.\" EVIDENCE -BASED MEDICINE Evidence-based medicine emerged as a definingconcept in managing healthcare systems. It alsogave rise to a new specialty - health technologyassessment, where 'technology' included mostaspects of diagnosis and treatment, as well asactual equipment. Assessors were not clinicians,but knew how to analyse the literature on clini-cal trials and how to do meta-analysis. Els Borst was an enthusiastic advocate of evidence-based guidelines, and for establishingpatient-led criteria for prioritising scarceresources. In the early 1980s, while medicaldirector in Utrecht, she attended early interna-tional meetings on setting priorities and contain-ing costs in healthcare. As she became increasingly involved in wider policy issues, she began to move away frommanagement. In 1986 she became vice-president of the Dutch Health Council, agovernment advisory body, and got her first tasteof the political process. \"I could see how reportsI wrote were treated by the minister and by themembers of parliament, and I got a feel for how political life works.\" Now she was in a position to influence health policy at a national level, and she could set her ownagenda. In 1987, she became the first secretary ofthe International Society for Health TechnologyAssessment, a network of organisations doing similar work - including the Institut National de laSant\u00e9 et de la Recherche M\u00e9dicale (INSERM) inFrance, the King's Fund in the UK, and the Health Councils of Australia and Canada. SPECIALIST CENTRES She lost no opportunities to argue the case for evidence-based medicine, and must surely takesome credit for the Netherlands' good record oncancer treatment. In 1987, the Dutch HealthCouncil became one of the first in Europe to advocate restricting certain cancer treatments tospecialist centres with minimum annual case loads. \"We call it dividing and concentrating, and we asked the oncologists to make arrangementsabout how they divided the tasks between them.\" Some disciplines - ear, nose and throat spe- cialists get an honourable mention - respondedwell. They got together, and decided who shouldspecialise in what. Others were less compliant.\"When you talk to doctors in small hospitals theysay: well it is so interesting... I want to carry outmy speciality as widely as possible. They are alsoafraid that if they haven't treated a cancer patientfor six years, they will lose their market value. Ofcourse it is in their interests. But it is not in thepatients' interests.\" She cites cancer of the oesophagus as an example of an operation that is far more success-ful when a practitioner deals with at least 10cases a year. But even 15 years later, a hospitalwas recently given a warning for continuing tooperate on oesophageal cancer, despite seeingonly two cases a year. Els Borst recognises that the culture of the health service cannot be changed overnight, \"If you let all those professors have their way, they would all have their own CT scanners\"InsideTrack 40CANCER WORLD JANUARY-FEBRUARY 2005and has told other politicians that it will take time. But she does not accept that health pro-fessionals can continue to put their own self-interest first. In 1992, she wrote a report warn-ing the medical profession that if they did notput their own house in order, politicians woulddo it for them, and she pointed out that politi-cians know more about cutting costs than pro-viding healthcare. FURIOUS REACTION Her report, Medical Specialists at a Crossroads , provoked a furious reaction from the profession,not least because it revealed two-fold to five-foldvariations in levels of treatment by differentdoctors - variations that called into question thequality of patient treatment. It found over-treatment in some areas and, possibly even worsefor patients, under-use of other medicalinterventions. The profession realised that unless it sorted itself out, health insurers would insist on US-style managed care, in which doctors would haveto get the go-ahead from the insurer for everyintervention on a case by case basis. \"For the firsttime the medical profession began to understandthat the guidelines were no longer a plaything. Itwas becoming serious.\" Politicians, desperate to find ways to economise on healthcare, loved this. Partly onthe strength of the Crossroads report, one year later, the newly elected government offered ElsBorst the poisoned chalice of Health, Welfareand Sports Minister - with a brief to cut thehealth budget. Faced with the question of where to wield the axe, the issue of evidence-based treatmentstook on immense importance. If free healthcarehad to be rationed, then clearly you want to knowyou are not wasting money on expensive treat-ments unlikely to be of benefit. \"I always arguedthat before we set priorities in the sense of with-holding treatment from those who need it, weshould try to make healthcare much more effec- tive and efficient.\" DIFFICULT DECISIONS She managed to get away with a series of smallsavings, mainly through withdrawing reimburse-ment from over-the-counter medicines for minorailments - cough mixture for example. Medicineswith no proven efficacy and homeopathic medi-cines were also taken off the list of reimbursedmedicines, as were some medical aids such aselasticated stockings. Reimbursement for in-vitrofertilisation (IVF) treatment after the thirdattempt was also withdrawn. Difficult decisions about serious conditions remained. Among them, the question of reim-bursement for Taxol (paclitaxel), an expensivenew drug that can offer around six months' extralife for patients with ovarian cancer. Her advisorsargued against the drug, but in the end Els Borstdecided to pay for it. \"If it had been a disease ofvery old people with a very short life expectancy,maybe you could make a case against it, butthere are so many young women who have youngchildren, for whom a half year living longer is stillimportant.\" She did, however, insist on strictguidelines on when to use the drug. She also went against the advice of her staff in deciding to make available new anti-retroviraldrugs for HIV before they had completed the fullclinical trials. Even today, people still occasional-ly come up to her in the street to thank her forsaving their lives with this decision. However, she did exclude some treatments from reimbursement - including two that hadbeen shown to delay the progress of Alzheimer'sdisease by a couple of months, and an experi-mental surgical treatment for Parkinson'sdisease. THE PRICE OF LIFE Els Borst has thought a great deal about whatprice can be put on an extra month or year of life.\"They fear they will lose their market value if they haven't treated a cancer patient for six years\"InsideTrack CANCER WORLD JANUARY-FEBRUARY 2005 41This was not just a professional question for her. Both her husband and her brother-in-law died ofcancer, and both took the decision, near the end,to forego further treatment. She believes that when patients have options clearly spelled out - side-effects, chances ofresponse, how many months or weeks it couldgive them - an increasing number opt for pallia-tive care. The patient is weighing up the benefits against the burdens of treatment. The minister,however, has to weigh up the benefits against thecosts. In practice, Els Borst tended to go with thebenefits. \"To say that a few extra months of life isnot worth the money is a very hard and political-ly dangerous thing to say. Six months may meansomething very different to a mother with ayoung child than to an older person.\" In an ideal world, she believes every patient would be correctly informed and able to choose.\"There will always be some patients who are so afraid of dying that they will do anything to stayalive an hour longer - but they are the real excep-tions. I don't think there are many who are ask-ing for the stars.\" Els Borst knows better than most that this is not an ideal world. Doctors find it hard to spellout bleak options even when they know theirpatient is not going to survive. \"A doctor whoabandons hope too soon is not a good doctor,\"she says. \"But very often the patient knows thatif the doctor is honest he or she is going to saythat it is over. There is not much more to be donein terms of treatment. The box is empty. A gooddoctor starts that conversation at the momentthe patient is ready for it. It is all very subtle, andit is one of the reasons why you should reallyhave one and the same doctor during the courseof your cancer.\" Els Borst also has an acute appreciation of the \"Some patients will do anything to stay alive an hour longer - but they are exceptions\" On a visit to a home care patientBRAM GEBUYSInsideTrack 42CANCER WORLD JANUARY-FEBRUARY 2005value of good nurses, and during her time at the ministry the nursing profession saw lastingimprovements in both status and pay. \"I openedpossibilities to become nurse practitioners, and tospecialise and get better training. I always arguedtheir case and sung their praises whenever I gotthe chance. They should work on an equal profes-sional level with the doctor. Nurses have their ownprofessional expertise to bring to treatment plans.One of my children is a nurse and I hear that theway they get along has completely changed. Theynow call doctors by their first name. It's a smallthing but symbolic of the change.\" THE PATIENT VOICE Another important legacy from her time in officeis the agreement Els Borst won to provide 30million euros a year to support the patient voice,allocated to active, democratic organisations thatnot only provide good information and supportfor patients, but also promote public awarenessand engage with the political process. She believes patient groups have risen to the challenge of their new roles and responsibilities,and are themselves beginning to think about cost-effectiveness and evidence-based treatment.Some patient groups were once seen as thepatient arm of pharmaceutical PR campaigns;now they work increasingly with the medical pro-fession to put well-researched and well-arguedcases to politicians. And today Els Borst, retiredfrom the front line of politics, works closely withthose groups as President of the DutchFederation of Cancer Patients Organisations. With almost maternal pride she recounts how the chair of the Breast Cancer Associationrecently told her that members were against theroutine use of a new radiotherapy technique onthe grounds that the extra cost increased muchfaster than the extra benefit. The feeling was,explained the chair, that the money could be bet-ter used doing something else for breast cancerpatients. To illustrate her point she sketched a cost-benefit graph as she spoke! This does not mean that state money has succeeded in co-opting the Breast CancerAssociation to the government's cost-savingagenda. In fact it is running a highly effectivecampaign to force the Dutch health service toimprove breast cancer treatment. It has given allhospitals until 1 January 2007 to comply with aset of guidelines on minimum standards of care- covering issues such waiting times, levels ofexpertise and choices between different inter-ventions. The Association warns that hospitalsthat fail to do so will be not be used by anywoman with a lump in her breast. Nor can anyone accuse Els Borst of begrudg- ing money to cancer services. She oversaw thebiggest ever revamp of Holland's radiotherapyservices during her second term in office and shestill takes every opportunity to encourage othermedical professionals to campaign for similarcash injections. Medic, politician and now, in semi-retire- ment, President of the Dutch Federation ofCancer Patients Organisations, Els Borst recent-ly summed up her philosophy of health care in aspeech delivered to the European Society forTherapeutic Radiology and Oncology (ESTRO)on opening their conference last year: \"From time to time, it is necessary to leave your bunker, step over the fence ... and enterthe political arena for a short while. Because Ithink it is your responsibility to address thepolicymakers in your country when thingsthreaten to go wrong. Your voice can be verypowerful. In the first place, because you knowwhat you are talking about. You can show thefacts. And secondly, because you are not askinganything for yourselves, but for your patients. Byjoining forces, patient organisations andorganisations of professionals can enhance theirinfluence considerably.\" State funding of 30 million euros a year to patient groups is a legacy of Els Borst's time in officeCANCER WORLD JANUARY-FEBRUARY 2005 45Impact Factor Compliance with consensus guidelines has been a thornyissue in oncology for some years now. At one pole is an increas-ingly large body of clinicians whovalue guidelines as indispensable toolsin helping them design, deliver andevaluate treatment interventions. Atthe other is a more sceptical groupwho regard guidelines as an unwar-ranted intrusion into their right to treat patients in the way their knowl-edge and experience dictate.And in the middle is a morass of ethi-cal, clinical, cultural and financialissues that complicate further analready complex picture.Debate on the rights and wrongs ofguideline implementation seems set togather pace in the wake of a recentlypublished study on breast cancer guideline implementation fromCanada. Reporting their findings in theJournal of Clinical Oncology (22: 18, 3685-93), Nicole National du Qu\u00e9bec, and colleagues,suggest that treatment according toconsensus guidelines is associated withimproved survival in women withbreast cancer in the community. THE STUDY H\u00e9bert-Croteau and her team startedfrom the premise that, although previ-ous work had shown 'reasonable com-pliance' with consensus recommenda-tions for treatment of women withbreast cancer, the impact of compli-ance on survival was unclear. Theyreviewed a cohort of women they hadpreviously monitored for evidence ofguidelines-based treatment in the1980s and early 1990s to ascertainwhether compliance with guidelinesfor systemic adjuvant therapy hadimproved survival.Patients had been randomly selected from all new cases of node-negativebreast cancer reported to the Qu\u00e9bectumour registry in 1988-89 and 1991-92, and to the province hospitalAlex MathiesonDoctors who shun guidelines get worse results An unhelpful straightjacket or an essential tool for optimal treatment?

The dates were significant, as they repre-sented the years before and after theintroduction of guidelines from theNational Institutes of Health (in1990) and the St Gallen consensusconference (1992). The St Gallenguidelines were used as the set stan-dard of care in the new study.Data were collected from chartreviews and other sources such asradiotherapy and oncology records,pharmacy databases and interviewswith attending physicians. Initial(phase 1) data collection was conduct-ed during 1995-96 to record the dis-ease state at diagnosis and treatmentof the primary tumour, with phase 2collection carried out in 2001-02 togather information on recurrences anddeaths. Patients were assigned a riskcategory for recurrence using mode of Riskcategory definitions and thetreatments the authors consider to beconsistent with guidelines for eachrisk category are set out in the boxes.The cohort included 1,541 women.Risk of recurrence was found to be minimal in 24%, moderate in 13%, andhigh in 51%. Sixty-five percent of thewomen had received treatment consis-tent with the guidelines (including98.4% of those at minimal risk) and24.7% had not (10.3% were unknown).It is the identified relationship between compliance with treatmentguidelines and survival that gives thestudy such topical interest. H\u00e9bert-Croteau and her team found that sur-vival was better in the women treatedaccording to the guidelines, particu-larly among the moderate-risk catego-ry. Adjusted health ratios of deathwere 1.0 for women at moderate risktreated according to guidelines, and2.3 for those who were not. For thoseat high risk, the ratios were 2.0 and2.7 respectively.The study found that not only was riskcategory an independent significantpredictor of survival, but compliancewith treatment guidelines was as well.It concludes that treatment accordingto guidelines is \"associated withimproved survival of women withbreast cancer in the community\", andthat adoption of guidelines for treat-ment is \"an effective strategy for dis-ease control\".

It's expected, butit's nice nevertheless when you see ithappen.\"This is a view shared by Isabelle Ray-Coquard, who works in oncologicalguidelines evaluation at the CentreL\u00e9on Lyon, France.\"I'm not surprised,\" she says. \"There issome research on the impact of clini-cal guidelines on the general popula-tion, and it all suggests the same - that compliance with consensusguidelines is associated withimproved survival.\"The interesting thing about theH\u00e9bert-Croteau study is the numberof patients reviewed,\" she continues.\"You can demonstrate moreeffectively the impact of guidelineswith over 1,000 patients than you canin studies involving around 200, ashas been the case with work we havedone looking at the impact ofguidelines adoption on patients withsarcoma and colon and breastcancer.\" GUIDELINE DEVELOPMENT There is certainly a vibrant guidelinesindustry developing throughout theworld. In Europe, for instance, a variety of methods have been used bydifferent organisations to develop,disseminate and evaluate guidelines,and to try to steer clinicians awayfrom developing their own ad hocproducts (which may replicate oreven contradict efforts going onelsewhere) towards a moreconsensual approach.The SOR (Standards, Options,Recommendations) method of theF\u00e9d\u00e9ration Nationale des Centres deLutte Contre le Cancer (FNCLCC)adopts a programmatic approach toguideline development, and has beenproducing clinical practice guidelinesin cancer since 1993. Its main char-acteristic is that the guidelines aredeveloped by a multidisciplinaryexpert group who engage in thoroughliterature searches to produce evi-dence-based recommendations forpractice. Each guideline focuses onall aspects of patient management,from diagnosis to supportive care.The programmatic approach encour-ages the process of guideline adop-tion, where the guideline can beendorsed for local use through thesetting of local criteria. A strong 'after-care' ethos exists, in which guidelinedissemination, implementation, eval-uation, reporting and updating cometo the fore.The European Society for MedicalOncology (ESMO) has also thrownits considerable weight behind cancerguideline development. It set up aguidelines task force in 1998 inresponse to demands from its nationalrepresentatives throughout Europe, Women at moderate or high risk had a better chance of survival if the guidelines were followed H\u00e5kan Mellstedt: Medicine is much more complicated than it used to be.

The taskforce will review and revise the draftbefore forwarding it to theappropriate ESMO faculty forcomment. Further revisions will bemade by the task force prior topublication and dissemination. TheMCR will then be updated yearly,following the same process. It's quickand straightforward, but also robust.Rolf Stahel is chair of the ESMOguidelines task force. He believes theMCR approach is the right one topromote high standards throughout Europe. \"ESMO's approach is verydifferent from that needed to produceextensive clinical guidelines,\" he says.\"Our aim is to produce shortguidelines stating what is neededminimally to ensure good diagnosisand access to care and treatment as ameans of defining the basics thatshould be available to patientsthroughout Europe,\" he says. \"Theydon't preclude individual clinicians orinstitutions doing more. Nor are wetrying to push them down people'sthroats - they are there as an optionand a benchmark, not to takeresponsibility away from physicians.\"H\u00e5kan Mellstedt, chair of ESMO,has been a proponent of guidelinesfor many years in his native Sweden,and feels they are likely to becomeeven more important as timeprogresses.\"As a physician, I feel competent indiagnosis, treatment and after-care,\"he says. \"But sometimes I ask: do I,at this moment, know the optimaltreatment for this patient?

H\u00e9bert-Croteaubelieves there may be a number ofreasons why clinicians are wary.\"They might be afraid of toxic side-effects, for instance, or there mightbe other contraindications andmedical conditions that make themmore cautious,\" she says. \"We know,for example, that older women aregenerally treated for breast cancerless aggressively than youngerwomen. They have other healthconditions that may make them lesstolerant to very aggressive treatment.The choice of the patient is alsoimportant - some women might feelvery optimistic about the outcome oftheir disease and don't want to betreated so aggressively.\"She feels these are much more likelyreasons for non-compliance than themore commonly suggested one - thatclinicians are, at best, not aware ofguidelines' existence or, at worst,ignoring them.\"That might have been true 10 yearsago, but not now,\" she says. \"InCanada, there have been nationalinitiatives on diseases like breastcancer that raise awareness ofclinicians and patients. Nationalguidelines have been produced,widely disseminated and updated at regular intervals. Physicians areaware of them, and the pervasivenessof the evidence-based medicinemovement makes it less likely thatthe message will not get through.Non-compliance might be moreabout physicians making individualdecisions based on case by case assessments.\"Ray-Coquard believes that theweakness of supporting evidence insome guidelines may act as adisincentive for physicians. \"Someguidelines are not evidence based,because there are no scientific datato support them,\" she says. \"Theguideline for gastrointestinal stromaltumours (GIST), for instance, isbased on expert opinion, not hardevidence, because the evidence is notthere. But guidelines such as this arestill very important for physicians whotreat the disease.\"Ray-Coquard also believes that localopinion leaders have a great influenceon guideline adoption. \"The more youcan involve the local opinion leaderin the implementation of theguideline, the better the chance of itbeing adopted,\" she says. \"Researchhas proved that medical decisions areclearly linked to the local opinionleader - if his or her views are not inaccordance with the guideline, it willnot be used. And there is very goodevidence to suggest that some opinionleaders are not accustomed toevidence-based approaches.\"The question of whether guidelinesgive physicians everything they needto initiate appropriate treatment hasalso arisen. In an editorial in theJournal of Clinical Oncology, commenting on H\u00e9bert-Croteau'sstudy, Rebecca Silliman, of theBoston University Medical Center,suggests that although evidence-based guidelines are a necessarybeginning, and disseminating themcan influence physicians' knowledge and awareness, they are not inthemselves sufficient to changepractice. \"What is required is a muchmore comprehensive approach thatincorporates not only knowledge, butalso builds skills and affectsattitudes,\" she wrote.Mellstedt agrees with this. \"Today,oncology demands a multidisciplinaryapproach to the patient - before youtake a decision on how to treat thepatient, you should consult withcolleagues,\" he says. \"But as a basis,you should have guidelines, withthe multidisciplinary consensus ontop. The approaches are thereforecomplementary.\"While the debate continues, H\u00e9bert-Croteau can see encouraging signs thatguideline uptake is on the rise, and be-lieves her study puts forward a strongmessage to clinicians to recognise thevalue of guidelines and use them.\"We are beginning to understandwhat promotes the adoption ofguidelines, and what makes cliniciansmore receptive to them,\" she says.\"The more prestigious the sponsoringorganisation, and the more leaders inthe field supporting the guideline, thebetter the prospects of adoption.\"There have not been many studiesthat have evaluated guidelines, eventhough they have become verypopular in the last 10 or 15 years,\" shecontinues. \"For whatever reason,guidelines tend to be slow to pass intopractice, but if you show that theymake a difference to survival, it islikely to increase the chances ofcompliance.\" Impact Factor Compliance is influenced by local opinion leaders, but some still resist evidence-based approachese-World CANCER WORLD JANUARY-FEBRUARY 2005 61e-Lessons of yesterday point the way ahead From Harlem to Helsinki, from Stirling to Sarajevo, the Internet is being put to novel uses in the cause of cancer prevention and care. The lessons learned have now been used tomap out an action plan for Cancer on the Internet. New information and communication technologies have been used by andfor cancer patients for more than adecade. But it wasn't until June2003 that members of the cancer community first got together to formulate a com-mon approach to Cancer on the Internet, at aconference in New York called by the EuropeanSchool of Oncology. Last September a second conference was called, again in New York, which went one stepfurther. Over the course of two days, 150delegates from 13 countries, representing veryvaried levels of Internet use, shared experiencesand drew up suggested areas for action underthe headings: Promoting Digital Inclusion, e-Cancer Care, e-Cancer Patients, and FosteringGlobal Collaboration. These were incorporatedinto the revised New York Statement, which ispublished on p. 64. \"Our goal was to bring people together from all over the world who are interested in improv-ing cancer care, from prevention to end-of-lifecare, using information and communicationtechnologies,\" said Alex Jadad, a conference co-chair and the director of the Program forChristine Haran eHealth Innovation at the University HealthNetwork and University of Toronto in Canada.\"There are many success stories that peopledon't know anything about, and we cannotafford that... Only by sharing knowledge andlearning from one another's mistakes can wemove forward.\" DIGITAL INCLUSION Delegates heard about a variety of initiatives indifferent communities across the world that aimto increase the number of people able to benefitfrom Internet access. In India, doctors and nurses in underserved areas are getting access to cutting-edgeinformation through an initiative undertaken inpartnership between the WHO's HealthInterNetwork (HIN) and the publishers ofIndian biomedical journals. Joan Dzenowagis,project manager of the HIN, described how theproject has brought computers to primary healthcentres in the states of Orissa and Karnataka.HIN staff worked with the community to createthe infrastructure - as basic as phone lines -needed to support the computers and theInternet access, and together with local institutee-World 62 CANCER WORLD JANUARY-FEBRUARY 2005staff, they also trained more than 300 local public health personnel, so they could accessand use the journal articles and other healthinformation. In the very different setting of Harlem, New York, a project has been running to teachconsumer and healthcare providers a 'cancereducation curriculum.' The aim is to providehealth information in English and Spanish andteach community members how to findinformation online, as well as help healthcareproviders identify credible health websites. Rosemarie Slevin Perocchia, Director of the National Cancer Institute's Cancer InformationService of New York at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, who helped launchthe project, described how she and hercolleagues had got together with local groups tohold training workshops, educating 256consumers who were residents of thisunderserved area and 256 health care providersfrom around New York City. While theworkshops were successful, Perocchia reportedthat the project had struggled with enrolment,and observed that a 'champion', such as a localcelebrity, might have helped boost participation. Another initiative, this time in Bosnia Herzegovina, aims to provide simple, qualityinformation to cancer patients in a languagethey can understand. Anes Pasic, of the Instituteof Oncology at the Clinical Centre of theUniversity of Sarajevo, described his efforts tobuild a cancer support webpage for his hospital'spatients and their family members. The website,he says, is needed because physicians in hisoverburdened hospital don't always have the time needed to explain the disease as fully asthey would like. Currently only around 5% ofBosnians use the Internet for health purposes.While this is likely to improve once informationbecomes available in their own language, thehigh cost of Internet access remains a problem,he said. A series of reports from the field offered conference participants the chance to hearabout other efforts around the world, includinga cancer portal in Spain developed to reachpeople with cancer and to provide preventativeinformation to those without cancer; a newsearch feature on the National Cancer Institute(NCI) website called 'Best Bets' that helpsvisitors find the most pertinent information; anda Danish project that assessed the usefulness ofInternet support in a cancer rehabilitationcentre. OPTIMISING CANCER CARE The conference also heard about innovativetechniques being piloted in recent years to useinformation technology to improve the care ofcancer patients. In Scotland, handheld computers and cell phones were used in a study to assess patients'symptoms while they were receivingchemotherapy. Nora Kearney, a professor ofcancer care at the University of Stirling, whoheaded up study, explained how the technologyhad enabled healthcare professionals toestablish patterns of severity of symptoms overtime and allowed them to compare howIn India, doctors and nurses in underserved areas are getting access to cutting-edge information A website in Bosnia Herzegovina provides information to cancer patients in their own languagee-World CANCER WORLD JANUARY-FEBRUARY 2005 63 The 'Kardian portable to essential careTOLOCHKO / ITAR-TASS / CORBIS / CONTRASTO64 CANCER WORLD JANUARY-FEBRUARY 2005 e-Cancer Patients The Internet is the cornerstone of the techno-cultural revo- lution that is starting to transform the nature of cancer con-trol. Patients have been at the forefront of this revolutionand many are now regularly using the Internet to obtaininformation about their disease and its treatment, seek sup-port from on-line patient communities and support groups,share knowledge and experiences with other patients andcommunicate with their professional carers and loved ones.There is a great deal of confusion and many concerns as tothe quality and appropriateness of online patient resources;however, it is impossible to police the Internet. In order toaddress these concerns, many governmental and non-governmental organizations have developed guidelines forquality health websites and on evaluating health informationon the Internet. Unfortunately, implementation of theseguidelines has been patchy. Moreover, there is little or nogovernment protection for e-consumers of health sites parti-cularly in terms of privacy, security and confidentiality. Suggested actions: Raise awareness of quality criteria for health websites that have been developed by a number of reputable agencies.Facilitate widespread dissemination of these guidelines viaestablished networks and encourage compliance amongstcancer website developers. Promote research into tools that can help consumers find quality health information and undertake an inventory ofcurrently available resources that can help patients honetheir critical evaluation skills (e.g. the US National CancerInstitute's document on how to evaluate health informationon the Internet, MedCIRCLE etc). Lobby for standards for e-health and ICTs, while main- taining freedom to innovate. Urge governments to take action if website providers undermine cancer patients' rights. Encourage sharing of best practice on running effective online patient support communities (both peer- andfacilitator-led). Foster discussion and debate amongst all stakeholder groups on ways the healthcare sector can become moreresponsive to the needs of e-cancer patients.e-Cancer Care The Internet provides an important tool to facilitateclinical practice and cancer research. Professional accessto and use of content and Internet applications is anessential part of providing appropriate cancer care;however, it has lagged for reasons of cost, effort, policyand other barriers. Suggested actions: Raise awareness of ways in which the Internet can impact on diverse cancer outcomes and stimulate large-scaleresearch in this area. Promote the potential of ICTs to reduce workload and costs and improve communication and continuity of care. Identify workable solutions to the technological, legal and attitudinal barriers to patient-physician communications viae-mail. Point to the usefulness of the Internet as a means of pro- viding continuing professional education and facilitatingmentorship initiatives. Encourage education providers touse web-based education approaches more widely. Call on the relevant authorities to include a short course on the relevance and application of ICTs in healthcare inthe undergraduate curriculum and promote coverage of thistopic as a fundamental component of continual medicaleducation activities. Support efforts to establish clinical trials registries that are freely accessible to the public, accurate, inclusive andelectronically searchable.13-14 September 2004 2ndINTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CANCER ON THE INTERNET New York Statement: Using the Internet to optimize cancer controle-WorldCANCER WORLD JANUARY-FEBRUARY 2005 65Promoting Digital Inclusion Internet access is becoming a reality in many countries worldwide as basic infrastructure and services continueto improve, but there are major obstacles in ensuringaccess is available and affordable so that all can benefit.These obstacles include cultural and economic factors,infrastructure, literacy, and language. An affordable,reliable, durable and high-speed infrastructure is requiredand relevant content will motivate Internet use. Moreover,skills to use and manage connectivity and content areessential. Global, national, and local efforts for e-inclusionare an important means to extend the benefits of ICTs toall citizens. Suggested actions: Work beyond the cancer sector to encourage electricity and phone providers as well as government departments toimprove connectivity, even in the remotest settings. Find local solutions for developing relevant and culturally appropriate content. Encourage the application of the principles of good health communication by those developing content for theInternet and raise awareness of the need to tailor onlineinformation to meet the needs of people with health litera-cy or other communication difficulties. Intensive training efforts are required to equip under- served members of the cancer community with the skillsthey need to use the Internet in an optimal manner.Fostering Global Collaboration Many organizations have as their mandate global cancer con- trol and international activities. Their efforts can be facilitat-ed through collaboration in developing and disseminatingstandards and research, sharing experience and best practice,and facilitating technology development, testing and deploy-ment. National and international co-ordination can optimizeuse of limited resources and avoid duplication of effort. Suggested actions: Help develop the eUICC as a global resource for collabo- ration. Identify other innovative ways to promote collaboration amongst international, regional and national cancer organi-zations in efforts to harness the power of the Internet in thefight against cancer. Mapping Internet-based resources cre-ated by cancer organizations worldwide should be a priority. Think globally; act locally - identify and support local champions to ensure the sustainability of initiatives andoptimize local involvement, especially around preventionand health promotion activities. Explore the feasibility of establishing an international organization for people interested in collaborating on initia-tives relating to Cancer on the Internet, including those tar-geted at low-income countries. Develop a workable mechanism to facilitate the sharing of best practice amongst people active in the cancer-related ICT arena.Participants at the International Conference on Cancer on the Internet are committed to promoting and developing the potential of the Internet in support of cancer efforts worldwide, from the globalto the individual level. This statement was drafted at the first international conference in June2003 and revised at the second conference in September 2004. The New York Statement identifieskey areas for action, advocacy and collaboration in realizing the potential of the Internet for cancer control. Conference participants believe that cancer control can be improved, in all countries and for all people,through the efficient and effective use of the Internet. This applies to the whole cancer continuum from preventionthrough diagnosis, treatment, survivorship and palliative care. Information and communication technologies (ICT)have helped cancer control in many different ways and the benefits are being rapidly extended as the Internetgrows. Internet applications and content resources for all cancer communities are an essential part of improvingcancer control. This statement recognizes the significant potential benefits the Internet has for the manystakeholders involved in cancer control efforts: patients and their loved ones, citizens, health professionals,researchers, policy makers, educators and organizations.e-WorldJOSE LUIS PELAEZ, INC. / CORBIS / CONTRASTOe-World 66 CANCER WORLD JANUARY-FEBRUARY 2005successfully nurses in different locations were managing symptoms. A different sort ofcomparison, this time between US and Finnishsurvival statistics, was made possible through awebsite, www.finprog.org, which developssurvival curves based on breast cancer riskfactors. The creator of the website, JohanLundin, of the Biomedical Informatics Groupat the University of Helsinki, explained how itcould be used by clinicians to help withtreatment decision-making. The Internet is also being used in an effort to boost participation in clinical trials, which is cur-rently running at just 5% among US cancerpatients - a situation that Cindy Lollar, of theOffice of Cancer Information Products andServices and Systems at the NCI, attributedlargely to the fact that around 80% of patientsknow nothing about them. In an effort to boostparticipation, said Lollar, the NCI has added to its website comprehensible summaries of open trials, together with a search facility that enablespatients to search for trials relevant to their con-dition. Similar information has also been madeavailable through the Cochrane Center Registerof Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), which listsmore than 30,000 trials. But perhaps the most important impact of the Internet in improving cancer care, arguedUS Cochrane Director Kay Dickerson, hascome about as a result of empowering patients.In particular, she attributed the move towardsevidence-based medicine largely to pressurefrom patients who, thanks to the Internet,became able to take a more critical attitudetowards their own treatment. Tom Ferguson, of the Pew Internet & American Life Project, who has beenchampioning the cause of e-patients for morethan 15 years, believes that well-informedpatients have a great deal to offer the cancerworld. \"These new medical colleagues,\" he says,\"may help us find sustainable solutions to many of the seemingly intractable problems that nowplague all modern healthcare systems.\" FORWARD THROUGH GLOBAL COLLABORATION Not all speakers agreed over how many onlinecancer patients actually visit health sites, orabout how much benefit is gained by those whodo. It was clear, however, that most cancerorganisations across the world - around 90%according to a study conducted at the Universityof Toronto - are now geared up to using theInternet to fulfil their missions of providinginformation, promoting research, holdingscientific meetings and publishing research data. This opens up great possibilities for building global collaboration over any aspect of cancerinformation, care or prevention. Already 280cancer organisations affiliated to the International Union Against Cancer (UICC), in more than 80 countries, are using the Internetfor the dissemination of information, such as itstobacco control programmes. Other internationalcancer organisations have built their ownnetworks. The challenge for the future, it was argued, was not to build new networks from scratch, butto work with what we have and seek to extendexisting networks. Adapting big businessmarketing techniques and building partnershipswith technology companies are two ways inwhich this is being achieved. \"The Internet is already changing the way we are approaching cancer control: from theglobal to the personal level,\" said Dzenowagisfrom WHO, commenting on what she hadheard over the two days. \"We have newopportunities to work together and contribute.This conference was an important venue forhighlighting some of the most promisinginnovations for patients and clinicians.\"The Internet is also being used in an effort to boost participation in clinical trialsFocus 68 CANCER WORLD JANUARY-FEBRUARY 2005Sometimes, no news is news. In clinical trials, where newmedical treatments are tried out on human subjects, no news - aninconclusive result, indicating that thetreatment is useless, or a negative one,indicating that it is harmful - can beas scientifically important as a positiveresult. Unfortunately, such a result ismuch less likely to be reported.That is particularly true for trialssponsored by the pharmaceuticalindustry which, according to theAmerican Medical Association(AMA), accounted for over 70% of thefunding for such trials in America in2002, the most recent year for whichfigures are available. The lack ofreporting of null or negative findings ispernicious because it skews the resultsof so-called 'meta-analyses', whichcompile data from previous studies ofa treatment. If only positive results arereported, then a meta-analysis risksbeing too laudatory.The medical profession has beenaware of this problem for a long time.However, pharmaceutical companieshave a vested interest in keeping nega-tive results quiet, so change has beenslow in coming. But the proper bal-ance between commercial confiden-tiality and public disclosure in the caseof drugs, where ignorance can costlives through misprescription, is differ-ent from that for, say, computer chips.The widespread government fundingof basic drug research also gives the public a moral claim on the results.And a confluence of forces in the pastfew weeks may well succeed in push-ing drug companies towards greateropenness. THE TIMES THEY ARE A CHANGIN ' The first of these forces was a legalsettlement last month betweenGlaxoSmithKline (GSK), a Britishpharmaceutical company, and thestate of New York. A lawsuit filed inJune by Eliot Spitzer, New York'sattorney-general, alleged that GSKhad deliberately suppressed negativeresults from four clinical trials of Paxil,an anti-depressant. In the settlement,GSK agreed to post online summariesof all of the clinical trials it completedafter December 27th 2000 (the datethat Glaxo Wellcome merged withSmithKline Beecham).The second force is that onSeptember 9th the InternationalCommittee of Medical JournalEditors, a group consisting of the edi-tors of the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), the Lancet and 11 other top-flight medical publications, put the screwson those who conduct clinical trials.They announced that from the middleof 2005 their journals would no longerpublish the results of trials that hadnot been registered in advance in anindependent database open to the scrutiny of all. The journal editorsdo not advocate a particular database,but they do point out thatclinicaltrials.gov, which is run byAmerica's National Institutes ofHealth, is the only one which satisfiestheir criteria at the moment.At first glance, the posturing of a fewscientific journals might look puny inthe face of the might of the drug com-panies. But the editors' proposalactually has teeth, because evenhard-nosed corporations value thelegitimacy that publication in animportant peer-reviewed journal hason their results. And although only 14journals have signed up to the initia-tive so far, other journals carryingresults of clinical trials typically taketheir lead from the journals that arespearheading it.Defenders of the pharmaceuticalindustry claim that forcing thecomplete reporting of results mightreduce the incentive to develop newdrugs by revealing a firm's hand tooearly in the development process. ButJeffrey Drazen, the editor of the NEJM,argues that the rewards of success areso big that requiring such reporting willnot stop companies from proposingtrials they think have a chance ofsuccess. What it might reduce, he says,is the number of 'seeding trials'. Theseare trials of drugs that have alreadybeen approved for one use, and are The sounds of silence Negative clinical-trial results are underreported. But this may soon change.CANCER WORLD JANUARY-FEBRUARY 2005 69then tested for secondary treatments which have little hope of success. Firmsuse these trials as marketing tools, toput drugs into the hands of doctors inthe hope that those doctors willprescribe them more often. The mereexistence of seeding trials indicates thatthe balance between confidentialityand disclosure is skewed.The editors' initiative will help, but itwill serve only to flush out now-hid-den trials so that questions can beasked about what happened to them ifno public report of their results ensues. It will not force those ques-tions to be answered. The third factor,a political one, may deal with that.Legislation is in the works in bothhouses of America's Congress toreform the reporting of trials. Inparticular, Chris Dodd, Tim Johnsonand Edward Kennedy, threeDemocratic senators, are expected topropose, within the next week or two, * a law that would increase compliancewith existing requirements to post trialdata to clinicaltrials.gov. It would probably adopt a proposal made by theAMA that registration in a centraldatabase be a requirement for theapproval of human trials, as well asintroducing new requirements toinclude trial results in the database.The industry disputes the need forthis. Caroline Loew, a spokesman forPharmaceutical Research andManufacturers of America (PhRMA),a trade group, claims that the industryhas a \"very good history ofFocus Lack of reporting of null or negative findings distorts the results of meta-analyses *The bill was introduced on October 7th 2004, and was referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce WALTER HODGES /CORBIS / CONTRASTO70 CANCER WORLD JANUARY-FEBRUARY 2005compliance\". This is stretching the truth. As Catherine De Angelis, theeditor of JAMA, points out, a group ofbig drug companies agreed in 1997that they would create a centraliseddatabase. But, because there wasno enforcement mechanism, theyconveniently forgot about it.Furthermore, in a letter written toPhRMA in June, Henry Waxman, aDemocratic congressman fromCalifornia, pointed out that theindustry was not even complying withexisting legal requirements to postcertain trials to clinicaltrials.gov. AlanGoldhammer, another spokesman forPhRMA, claims that Mr Waxman wasrelying on preliminary data.BAND ON THE RUN In his letter, Mr Waxman also com-plains that despite PhRMA's budget ofover $72.7m for lobbying the federalgovernment, when the House ofRepresentatives' Government ReformCommittee held hearings on the issueof clinical trials and requested that anindustry spokesman testify, nonedeigned to show up. So there are rea-sons to suspect that the proposal madeby PhRMA on September 7th, for anew, voluntary database, is less goodthan it sounds. Critics point out that itwill only contain summaries of theresults of trials after they are complet-ed, rather than reporting ongoing trials.It will also be restricted to trials fordrugs that are being marketed in America.Dr Goldhammer replies that this isbecause PhRMA has made a deliber-ate decision to focus on practisingAmerican physicians, who need toknow only the final results for drugssold in America, rather than on theneeds of researchers. But this is short-sighted. Researchers could make gooduse of the more complete set of data.Dr Goldhammer says that what hisgroup is proposing is \"delinking a reg-istry from a results database\". Thatsort of obfuscation seems opposed totransparency. But transparent report-ing of trials looks as if it is on its way,regardless.Focus This article was first published by The Economist Newspaper Limited, London, on 9 September 2004, and is reprinted with permiss ionThe balance between confidentiality and disclosure is "}
