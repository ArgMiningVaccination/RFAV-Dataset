The Holocaust was during the same period of World War II. \"What is it called the Holocaust?\" you may ask. The Holocaust originates from the Greek language and means \"completely burnt offering to God.\" How does this relate to the Holocaust where almost 8 million Jewish people died? In this essay, you will be informed about the main leader of the Nazis, why saying that Hitler only captured Jews is historically inaccurate, concentration camp treatment, and five atrocious experiments done by the Nazi soldiers to innocent prisoners. Antisepsis wasn't the only way to prevent illness. By the end of the 18th century people had found a way to try to prevent smallpox, a disease that had caused around 60 million deaths in Europe in that century alone. They had noticed that the survivors of smallpox never developed the disease again, so they began to scratch small pieces of smallpox sores into their skin, which would give them a mild case of smallpox, so they wouldn't develop full-blown smallpox later. This was called variolation. They only problem was that sometimes it would cause a full-blown case instead of a mild one. \"In the late 1800 and early 1900's, infectious diseases were the most serious threat to health and well being.\" Until the late 1900's the leading cause of death was communicable diseases. As doctors gain more knowledge about medicine the death rate of those disease has substantially decreased. The three main illnesses of the 1800's-1900's were scarlet fever, tuberculosis, and chicken pox, yet a positive outcome from these horrendous sicknesses were antibiotics, remedies, and vaccines. The question if HeLa cells could infect experimenters is raised by Chester Southam. By injecting prisoners from the Ohio State Penitentiary system, Southam discovers that a healthy immune system can fight cancer. However, his tests infect hundreds without their consent or knowledge introducing the significance of informed consent. The Number code was introduced and \"written in response to Nazi war crimes, and stated that informed consent for research is absolutely essential.\" However, The U.S. did not adopt the code because no one wanted to prevent scientific Medical studies today have many benefits \u2014 from research to observe diseases and conditions, to experiments to discover cures for deadly ailments \u2014 which ultimately aid the public's health and well-being. However, not even a century ago, rules and protocol that helped run tests safely did not exist. The \"Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male\" shaped the foundation of modern medical ethics that protect people involved in clinical trials today. Elizabeth A. Fenn, Pox Americana: the great smallpox epidemic of 1775-82, (New York: Hill and Wang, 2001). Pages, ix, 384, index, bibliography. Review by Samantha Pilcher. The experiments performed by German physicians during World War II were torturous, unethical, and unreasonable when considering better ways in which the research could have been conducted. Experiments were performed on non-consenting camp prisoners by physicians attempting to improve soldier survival rates and further knowledge in lesser-explored medical fields (Coleman et al. 16). Experimentation to find a cure for Malaria was performed from February 1942 to April 1945, during which time prisoners were infected with malaria and treated with different drugs in order to find the best cure. Coleman notes, \"Over 1,000 involuntary subjects were used in these experiments. Many of the victims died and others suffered from severe pain and disability...\" In this experiment, researchers took advantage of the lack of medical knowledge that existed within the public. In particular, the Public Health Service conducted the experiment on 600 African American men in order to record the natural history of syphilis. Although the researchers told the men that they were being treated for \"bad blood\", which is a term encompassing several illnesses including syphilis, fatigue, and anemia, they did not receive the proper treatment needed to cure their ailments. Men were inclined to participate in the experiment because they received free meals, free medical exams, and burial insurance in turn. However, despite the men consenting to the experiment, there is no proof that verifies that the men were properly informed about the study and its purpose. In fact, the men were not provided enough information to properly consent to the experiment. Even when the cure for syphilis was discovered in 1947, researchers did not offer the medication to their subjects. Consequently, researchers abused their powers by recruiting test subjects that were unaware of the real purpose of their study. In this scenario, the medical knowledge of the researchers gave them power and an unjust advantage over their ignorant subjects. Researchers proved their corruption when this study, originally projected to last only 6 months, lasted instead for 40 In 1932, government doctors conducted a medical experiment known as the Tuskegee study. It took place in Macon County, Alabama. The Public Health Service launched 6 projects in the South in predominately poor black communities. One project took place in Macon County. The doctors were determined to diagnose as many as 10,000 people. By the end of 1931 there was not enough money to continue the program and therefore the doctors left. Public Health Service officials were anxious to benefit from the abandoned program. The head of the VD division Teleford Clark had a plan. If there was not enough money for this program then perhaps there was funding for less expensive research. He proposed Macon County as the ideal site for a 6 month study of untreated Denis Diderot once said, \"There are three principal means of acquiring knowledge... observation of nature, reflection, and experimentation. Observation collects facts; reflection combines them; experimentation verifies the result of that combination.\" What Denis Diderot talks about is logical when trying to obtain information on a certain subject, and this applies to experiments performed on humans. When individuals think of human experimentation, unethical and immoral are sometimes the first words the pop into their brain. Human experimentation is beneficial in the sense that it can it can provide factual information, advancements in the medical field, and how human experimentation will be beneficial in the future. From 1939 to 1945, Nazi doctors and physicians conducted roughly 70 research experiments, many resulting in death. These cruel experiments were normally conducted in concentration camps. The Nazis had three main areas of research: survival and rescue of german troops, testing of new pharmaceuticals and medical procedures, and experiments trying to confirm Nazi racial ideology. Some of the doctors involved in these experiments were: Karl Brandt, who was Hitler's personal physician and the major general for health and sanitation. Sigmund Rascher conducted high altitude and freezing experiments. Dr. Josef Mengele conducted experiments on twins.Dr.Kurt Heissmeyer worked to find a possible cure/immunity to tuberculosis. Dr. Carl Clauberg was the first Nazi doctor to successfully treat a woman for infertility, leading to Heinrich Himmler conducting artificial insemination experiments. And lastly Dr. Eppinger During World War II, Nazi scientists conducted human medical experiments in various concentration camps. Victims of these experiments included prisoners of war, and primarily Jews. They were not treated as humans, but rather as lab rats. Surgery was performed without sedatives. Patients were subjected to extreme conditions, such as boiling water. But why? Why were these experiments conducted in the first place? As the war raged on, new obstacles came in the direction of the Germans. The experiments were conducted partially intending to help resolve these solutions. Other reasons were to help fulfill the Nazi party's larger visions. Modern ethical guidelines for Human medical experimentation are a direct result of Nazi experimentation conducted Throughout the centuries, medical doctors have researched on live animals to find cure to several diseases which affect both the animals and humans. Even though many people endure this practice as noble, some people still look down at animal experimentation as a cruel and inhumane treatment to animals. The government has already authorized animal experimentation to mitigate the unrest by those people. In fact, The Animal Welfare Act covered most lab animals, and provided guidelines for pain alleviation during procedures, food, and housing. However, the government still has to take more action to spread the awareness about the benefits of animal experimentation (Person). The federal government needs to expand legislation of animal experimentation If someone searches human experimentation online it will tell you that human experimentation can be broadly defined as anything done to an individual to learn how it will affect him or her afterwards. Experimentation on a human being is the experimentation of humans to help find cures and to help fight off things like illnesses or diseases. It can also help provide us with the medicine and knowledge of what medication should be used to treat the injury or illness medication treats things. Like headaches, sore muscles, injuries, and many more things. There is a lot of debate over human experimentation and whether it is right, if it works, or if it is needed at all. Experimentation on humans, while sometimes beneficial, often has resulted There are numerous amounts of diseases all over the world. In the present time, these diseases are cured or contained by vaccines. A couple centuries ago, doctor Edward Jenner developed the first vaccine in 1796. He discovered this vaccine by observing his ambiance. Jenner realized that milkmaids (tend to cattle) frequently contracted cowpox, but after they convalesced they were immune to the deadlier disease smallpox. So Jenner said, \"Why not infect people with cowpox to confer immunity to the more dangerous disease.\" With his research, he got the pus from a milkmaid who had cowpox and put it on a small healthy eight-year-old boys cut. Eventually, the boy was infected with cowpox, how Jenner predicted. When he "}
