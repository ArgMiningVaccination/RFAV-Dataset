Jewell Smith, LAc EAMP LMT Jewell Smith is a third generation Washington native, born in Yakima, WA. Jewell attended the New Age School of Massage in Sebastopol California, completing her training in 1986. While studying Shiatsu massage at the New Age School of Massage, she became interested in Chinese Medicine. This interest led her to seek continuing education in Jin Shin Do, a type of acupressure based on acupuncture points. She studied Zen Shiatsu at the Northwest Institute of Oriental Medicine (NIAOM) in Seattle, WA. Ultimately, Jewell turned her attention primarily to acupuncture and graduated with a Masters degree in Acupuncture from NIAOM in 2003. She received National Certification from the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine in 2004. Jewell is a skilled massage therapist with over 30 years of experience. She is also a skilled acupuncturist with over 12 years of experience. This combination of therapy is uniquely synergetic as massage helps the body integrate the energetic treatment of acupuncture creating physical symptom improvements. These bodywork therapies move qi and blood, relax and lengthen muscles, improve range of motion and thereby reduce pain and improve function! Jewell has years of experience of treating various types of musculoskeletal pain and disorders, digestive issues, infertility, anxiety and depression, headaches, stress issues, ob/gyn issues and helping pregnant women through their pregnancy and labor. She integrates massage, cupping, gua sha, and chinese herbal formulas in her sessions, when needed. Jewell is happy to leave the big city and live in a smaller town closer to her family and help the local community with their health needs. She also enjoys gardening, cooking, raising chickens, hiking, drawing and painting. "}
