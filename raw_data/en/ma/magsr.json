Product Overview The Natural Balance\u00ae Shoe (NBS) addresses the biomechanical needs of the equine foot for support and protection in a domestic environment. This shoe offers the horse stability and protection that promotes optimal performance with minimal stress. The patented NBS design*, along with a few suggested hoof preparation guidelines, will help to properly orient the shoe to the coffin bone as well as help prevent hoof capsule distortion. When the hoof preparation and shoe placement guidelines are followed, improved foot function and health is often achieved, and hoof distortions that are often associated with common lameness issues are eliminated. Special Design Features The Steel Natural Balance\u00ae Lite Sport Shoe is a lite-rim, rolled toe shoe which offers good support to the hoof and protection to P-3. The toe area on the foot side is seated out to eliminate sole contact beneath the tip of P-3. The toe portion also has greater mass which means more material for wear. This will help maintain optimal P-3 and hoof wall orientation through a longer shoeing period. The convex inner-rim helps to improve traction and reduce weight. The roll at the toe continues around the toe quarters, back to the widest part of the shoe and allows the horse easy access to his individual position for breakover. There are five nail holes to the side so you have some options when nailing to poor quality feet. By having multiple nail hole choices, farriers can individualize left and right nailing patterns. Possible Uses The Steel Natural Balance\u00ae Lite Sport Shoes are used for a wide variety of athletic disciplines ranging from team roping, barrel racing, cutting or reining, to endurance & show horses. Because of the lite weight, yet durability of the shoe, athletes can maintain a high level of performance. Lastly, when used in conjunction with a Natural Balance Pad and sole support impression material, minor chronic lameness problems can be effectively treated. The forged steel, rim-shoe design helps to minimize the weight, yet offers durability for long lasting wear and better performance. *These horseshoes have been patented by Gene Ovnicek in U.S. Patent No. 5,727,633 Available Sizes: The Natural Balance Lite Sport Shoe is currently available in 5 Sizes: Size #4x0 - W=4.25\" x L=4.00\" "}
