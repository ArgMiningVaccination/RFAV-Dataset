Executive Summary The purpose of this community health needs assessment (CHNA) is to identify and prioritize significant health needs for the 231,000 community members served by Marian Regional Medical Center (MRMC) and Arroyo Grande Community Hospital (AGCH). The priorities identified in this report help to guide the hospital's community health improvement programs and community benefit activities as well as its collaborative efforts with other organizations that share a mission to improve health. This CHNA report meets the requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that not-for-profit hospitals conduct a community health needs assessment at least once every three years. MRMC is located at 1400 East Church Street in Santa Maria, California and is a Judeo-Christian healthcare ministry founded by the Sisters of St. Francis in 1940. Between 1940 and present day, MRMC has transformed into a state-of-the-art, 191-bed facility that is well-positioned to serve a continuously growing patient population. MRMC is designated a STEMI Receiving Center in Santa Barbara County and a Level III Trauma Center by Santa Barbara County's Emergency Medical Services Agency. Recently, MRMC opened a new Pediatric Emergency Department to enhance care for youth in the community. The hospital license also includes a 95 bed skilled nursing facility, homecare, hospice and home infusion programs, along with outpatient labs and radiology centers throughout the community. AGCH is located at 345 South Halcyon Road in Arroyo Grande, California and is approximately 15 miles north of Santa Maria. The AGCH has been serving the health care needs of the \"Five Cities\" area since it became a member of Dignity Health in 2004. Recently, AGCH completed the construction of their new Emergency Department to better meet the needs of the growing community. The hospital license also includes a 20 bed acute rehab center. The MRMC community includes zip codes 93454, 93455, (Guadalupe), and is home to 150,072 residents. The MRMC community is a culturally diverse area, with the majority of residents (67.2%) identifying as Hispanic or Latino(a). Within the MRMC community, 26.6% of individuals over the age of five speak English less than \"very well,\" and 31.1% of residents (age 25 and over) did not complete high school. In addition to the residents mentioned above, the Santa Maria Valley is home to a transient farmworker population drawn to work in the fields, which includes indigenous migrants from the Mexican states of Oaxaca and Guerrero. These individuals are often monolingual in their native pre-Hispanic indigenous language of Mixtec or Zapotec, and have an estimated population of 32,000 people in Santa Barbara County. The 2022 Point in Time Count for Santa Barbara County reported 457 persons experiencing homelessness in Santa Maria. AGCH serves the \"Five Cities\" community of southern San Luis Obispo County and includes zip codes 93420 (Arroyo Grande), Beach), 93444 (Nipomo), 93445 93449 (Pismo The community served by AGCH is home to 81,148 residents, with nearly two-thirds (64.8%) considering themselves White, not Hispanic or Latino(a). The Hispanic or Latino(a) population of the AGCH community is approximately one-quarter (26.8%) 5 Community Health Needs Assessment - May 2022 Marian Regional Medical Center of the total population. The AGCH community has a high school graduation rate of 91.0% for those aged 25 and older, and poverty rates below state and national levels. Two medically underserved communities have been designated within the MRMC and AGCH community by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), including Guadalupe (MUA/P ID: 00301) and Arroyo Grande (MUA/P: 00395). HRSA has also designated three different areas within the MRMC and AGCH community as health professional shortage areas. The hospital's dedication to engaging with the community, assessing priority needs, and helping to address them with community health program activities is in keeping with its mission. As CommonSpirit Health, we make the healing presence of God known in our world by improving the health of the people we serve, especially those who are vulnerable, while we advance social justice for all. The CHNA process was completed through quantitative and qualitative methods to collect and analyze primary and secondary data. This mixed-methods approach validates data by cross verifying from multiple sources, providing a broader perspective of the community and population health needs. In order to gain a thorough understanding of the medically underserved, low-income and minority populations living in MRMC's primary service area, an original community health survey was developed. A 38 question community health survey served as a primary data source. The community health survey was based upon select questions from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey Questionnaire (BRFSS) and previous CHNA reports prepared by Dignity Health. The final survey was distributed in-person in the community and was available online, to adults age 18 and older, in Spanish, English, and Mixteco. Using convenience sampling (non-probability) methods, survey responses were collected from 18 different locations within the community, including churches, senior centers, community events, homeless shelters, etc. Survey locations were selected based on the perception of being able to encounter the most vulnerable populations, including the medically underserved, low-income, and minority populations. A total of 770 individuals invested ten minutes of their time and completed the health survey in hopes of bettering their health and bringing better programs to the community. The significant community health needs identified for the MRMC and AGCH community extend far beyond health and health care. Social factors, including education, employment status, income level, gender, and ethnicity, all contribute to health inequities. According to the CDC, racial and ethnic minority groups throughout the United States experience higher rates of illness 6 Community Health Needs Assessment - May 2022 Marian Regional Medical Center and death across a wide range of health conditions, including diabetes, hypertension, obesity, asthma, and heart disease, when compared to their White counterparts.1 Based upon perceptions of the community, the known health needs, and secondary health metrics, the three most significant health needs were identified. In accordance with Dignity Health policy, the following criteria were utilized to evaluate the prioritization of community needs, including: Size or scale of problem (how many impacted); Severity of problem; Disparity and equity; Known effective interventions; Resource feasibility and sustainability; and, Community support. Attaining health equity in the MRMC and AGCH community will require addressing the greatest disparities and helping the pockets of the community that are facing a constant uphill battle with everyday life. The following significant community health needs were determined for this 2022 CHNA Report, including: Educational attainment; Access to primary health care, behavioral health care, and oral health; and, Health promotion and prevention. Low levels of adult educational attainment was identified in the 2016 CHNA, the 2019 CHNA and now again in this 2022 CHNA Report. Education has been described as the most important modifiable social determinant of health, and low educational attainment levels are linked with poor health, more stress, higher poverty, and lower self-efficacy. Overall, 22.3% of the MRMC and AGCH community (or 32,438 individuals) over the age of 25 did not graduate high school or equivalent. Furthermore, in zip code 93458 (Santa Maria), less than half of the population (46.8%), over the age of 25, reported graduating high school (or equivalent). The need for an improvement in access to primary health care, behavioral health care, and oral health has been substantiated through primary data, secondary data, and HRSA. HRSA has designated two medically underserved communities within the MRMC and AGCH community, including Guadalupe (MUA/P ID: 00301) and Arroyo Grande (MUA/P: 00395). Mental health professional shortages were designated for the low income migrant farmworker population in Santa Maria, CA (HPSA ID: 7062407340) and Solvang/Lompoc/Guadalupe (HPSA ID: 7062778515). 1 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2022. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Health Equity. Retrieved from https://www.cdc.gov/healthequity/racism-disparities/index.html. 7 Community Health Needs Assessment - May 2022 Marian Regional Medical Center Lastly, health promotion and prevention is the third identified need within this CHNA Report. Heart disease and cancer are the leading causes of death at local, state, and national levels, while the most vulnerable members of the MRMC and AGCH community struggle to access health care. If the vulnerable communities are struggling to access health care, they are less likely to understand their current health status and access preventative cancer screenings. Besides difficulty accessing health care, the vulnerable communities face increased risk for heart disease and cancer due to their social determinants of health. They face food insecurity and more often live in areas that have higher levels of pollution. In order to help the most vulnerable communities reduce their chances of developing heart disease, cancer, or another chronic condition, targeted upstream health promotion and prevention is needed. While potential resources are available to address the identified needs of the community, the needs are too significant for any one organization. Making a substantial and upstream impact will require the collaborative efforts of community organizations, local government, local business leaders, and other institutions. The greater Santa Maria Valley and Five Cities area are home to a wealth of organizations, businesses and non-profits, including our local community colleges and our own healthcare system. This CHNA report was adopted by the Marian Regional Medical Center community board in May 2022. The report is widely available to the public on the hospital's web site, and a paper copy is available for inspection upon request at MRMC's Mission Integration and Education Office in Santa Maria. Written comments on this report can be submitted to MRMC's Mission Integration and Education Office at 1400 E.

Community Definition Marian Regional Medical Center (MRMC) and Arroyo Grande Community Hospital (AGCH) serve an aggregate community that encompasses all residents of northern Santa Barbara County and southern San Luis Obispo County, CA. The aggregate community is home to over 231,000 individuals residing in Santa Maria, Guadalupe, Nipomo, Orcutt, Arroyo Grande, Grover Beach, Oceano, and Pismo Beach, CA. The MRMC and AGCH defined community does not exclude any low-income or underserved populations and includes all members of the community. The communities served by MRMC and AGCH align with the residence location for 75% of all inpatient discharges, as well as the most recent Community Benefit Report. The geographic area of the communities served by MRMC and AGCH are shown on the following Figure 1. Figure 1. MRMC and AGCH Communities' Served Medically Underserved Areas/Populations (MUA/P) and Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSA) have been identified in the MRMC and AGCH communities by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA).

The community served by MRMC includes six zip codes representing the following City of Santa Maria, Guadalupe and Orcutt are located in northern Santa Barbara County and Nipomo is located in southernmost San Luis Obispo County. Nipomo (93444) is unique because it is equidistant between MRMC and AGCH and is considered a community served by both hospitals. Nipomo's demographic information will be included in the AGCH discussion to prevent duplication of data, and Orcutt's demographic information is included under zip code 93445 (Santa Maria). According to the American Community Survey (2016-2020, 5-year average), the MRMC community is home to 150,072 residents, with the majority (73%) residing within Santa Maria City.4 Santa Maria is the largest city in Santa Barbara County both in land area and population.5 2 Health Resources and Services Administration, 2022.

In the MRMC community, 26.6% of individuals over the age of five speak English less than \"very well.\" Educational attainment for adults age 25 and older continues to be a challenge for the MRMC community. Overall, 31.1% of the MRMC community residents age 25 and over did not complete high school. Furthermore, over half (53.2%) of the adults (age 25 and over) residing in zip code 93458 (Santa Maria), and 44.3% of adults residing in 93434 (Guadalupe) have less than a high school education. Conversely, the highest levels of education can be found in the adult population (age 25 and over) residing in zip code 93455 (Santa Maria/Orcutt) where 69.1% reported having at least some college/associates degree or higher.6 According to the U.S. Census, 2016-2020 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates, poverty levels exceed state (12.6%) and national levels (12.8%) in the following MRMC community locations: Zip code 93434 (Guadalupe) approximately 1 in 4 people live in poverty (24.0%); Zip code 93458 (Santa Maria), 15.0% of the population are below 100% of the poverty level, and another 14.2% have income between 100 to 149% of the poverty level. In addition to the residents captured by the formalized data sources above, the transient farmworker population drawn to work in the fields of Santa Barbara County and San Luis Obispo County are supported by indigenous migrants from the Mexican states of Oaxaca and Guerrero. These indigenous migrants are often monolingual in their native pre-Hispanic indigenous language of Mixtec or Zapotec. According to the National Center for Farmworker Health in 2017, there were an estimated 32,066 farmworkers in Santa Barbara County and 17,771 farmworkers in San Luis Obispo County.7 The 2022 Point in Time Count for Santa Barbara County reported 457 persons experiencing homelessness in Santa Maria and 2 in Guadalupe. The homeless population in Santa Maria in 2022 is similar to the 2019 total of 464 and higher than the 2020 total of 382.8 Table 2 below provides additional population characteristics for the MRMC community. 6 U.S. Census Bureau (2022). 2016-2020 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimate. https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=ZCTA5%2093420%20Populations%20and%20People&g=860XX00US93420,93433,93434,93444,93445,93449,93454,93455,93458&tid=ACSST5Y2020.S0601 7 National Center for Farmworker Health, 2022.

The CNI analyzes data at the zip code level for five factors known to contribute, or are barriers to health care access, including income, culture/language, education, housing status, and insurance coverage. Scores from 1.0 (lowest barriers) to 5.0 (highest barriers) for each factor are averaged to calculate a CNI score for each zip code in the community. Research has shown that communities with the highest CNI scores experience twice the rate of hospital admissions for ambulatory care sensitive conditions as those with the lowest scores. The average CNI score for the MRMC and AGCH communities was 3.6 The CNI scores range from a low of 2.4 in Pismo Beach to greater than 4 in Oceano, Santa Maria (93454 and 93458), and Guadalupe. The geographic areas with a CNI greater than 4, represents a geographic area with over 100,000 residents. The following Figure 2 provides further detail for the geographical distribution of CNI scores.12 12 Dignity Health (2022). Community Need Index.

MRMC and AGCH Community Needs Index Scores 15 Community Health Needs Assessment - May 2022 Marian Regional Medical Center IV. Assessment Process and Methods The 2022 CHNA was completed using quantitative and qualitative data from a variety of primary and secondary data sources. Primary data sources included a community health survey, a qualitative community health needs survey, and focus groups of priority populations. Secondary data sources at the local, state, and national level provided quantitative data. This mixed-methods approach validates data by cross verifying from multiple sources, providing a broader perspective of the community and population health needs. Each data source and the process utilized for assessment and collection is described in the following subsections. Community Health Survey, Vulnerable Populations As in prior CHNAs, MRMC once again solicited, and took into account, feedback from the medically underserved, low-income, and minority MRMC community members, including those with limited English proficiency, using an original community health survey. The original community health survey was developed based upon select questions from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey Questionnaire (BRFSS) and previous CHNA reports prepared by Dignity Health. Input on the community health survey was also provided by the Community Benefit Committee at MRMC and San Luis Obispo County Public Health Department. Santa Barbara County Public Health Department was also provided the opportunity to comment on the survey before it was widely distributed. A cultural competency review of the draft survey and translation into Spanish was completed by MRMC's Community Health Education Department. The final survey contained a total of 38 questions and was available in Spanish, English, and Mixteco languages. A copy of the English version can be found in Appendix B. Prior to launching the community health survey collection, a surveyor training was held on June 3, 2021. The purpose of the training was for all surveyors to understand the process and requirements for survey collection activities. Surveyors were trained how to complete a one-on-one interview with the participant, if they requested assistance to complete the health survey. The community health surveyors were members of the Dignity Health Community Health Department, Herencia Ind\u00edgena, and the promotores network in Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo Counties. The anonymous community health surveys were distributed using a convenience sampling strategy (non-probability) to survey adults (age 18 and over) living in the MRMC and AGCH community. This survey was not designed to be statistically representative of all residents in the community, but rather to provide an understanding of the social and health needs of the most vulnerable adult community members. Therefore, survey collection locations were selected based upon the perception of being able to encounter the target survey population. Before any community health surveys were collected, the responsible party at each location was contacted and permission was requested. 16 Community Health Needs Assessment - May 2022 Marian Regional Medical Center A total of 770 community health surveys were collected between June and July 2021 at 18 different locations in the MRMC and AGCH communities. Survey locations included churches, senior centers, community events, homeless shelters, housing development locations, farm worker housing, a COVID-19 vaccination site, and foodbanks. Survey participants did not receive any compensation or incentive in exchange for completing the health survey. During this same time period, the community health survey was also input into Survey Monkey and the link to participate was advertised through various local agencies. A complete list of the community locations where surveys were collected can be found in Appendix B. The community health survey data was compiled in Survey Monkey, which increased data quality and streamlined data analysis. Survey responses were analyzed using IBM SPSS statistics package and the results are discussed in the following chapter of this CHNA Report. Survey responses were analyzed as compared to various independent variables, including, place of residence, educational attainment, race/origin, and age. Complete results from the community health survey are provided in Appendix B. The community health survey was completed by 770 individuals residing in the MRMC and AGCH community ranging from 18 to over 90 years of age. As previously stated, the purpose of the community health survey was to gain a thorough understanding of the medically underserved, low-income, and minority populations living in the MRMC and AGCH community. The effort to capture responses from these individuals resulted in the majority of survey participants (73.6%) electing to complete their community health survey in Spanish and 27 individuals completing their health survey interview in Mixteco. Individuals who do not speak English can face challenges in many areas, including access to health care and understanding medical information. The survey participants' place of residence and their community health survey language is provided on the following table. Table 4.

Qualitative Targeted Outreach A qualitative survey was prepared and distributed to targeted organizations seeking their input to help identify and prioritize significant health needs in the adult and youth population and to identify any potential resources. Dignity Health reached out to various community partners including those representing the following communities: Laino(a), African American, Homeless, LGBTQ+, Seniors, the Community Benefit Committee of the MRMC Community Board, other local health care providers, and county public health departments. The list of organizations that were provided the opportunity to complete the qualitative survey can be found in Appendix C. The survey was prepared and made available between January 14 - February 4, 2022 using a cloud-based survey software. An email was sent to each organization with the chance to respond to the online survey (via Survey Monkey) or request an open discussion instead. The original survey and email transmission is available in Appendix C and specifically sought feedback on the following six items: As an organization and/or community member, what do you view as the top 5 greatest health needs facing our community? As an organization or community member, how would you address these needs? Are you aware of any potential resources that are available to help address these needs? 18 Community Health Needs Assessment - May 2022 Marian Regional Medical Center What is the most important youth health need in our community? What would you say is the most important thing that can be done to improve child health in our community? What is the greatest barrier to child wellness in our community? A total of 39 responses were received from various individuals between January and February of 2022. These responses were downloaded from the cloud-based survey software and the responses were grouped based on the response. After the responses were grouped, the data was tabulated and utilized in the decision making process of developing the identified needs for this CHNA. Survey response grouping and the tabulated responses can be found in Appendix C. Gala Pride and Diversity Center The Gala Pride and Diversity Center supports and empowers people of all sexual orientations, gender identities, and expressions to strengthen and unite the Central Coast Community. The Gala Pride and Diversity Center advocates for the Central Coast's LGBTQ+ community and helps them find support services. A focus group was facilitated by Patty Herrera, MA, Manager of Community Health, Dignity Health Central Coast, with six members of the Gala Pride and Diversity Center via a video conference. The purpose of the discussion was to discuss the health needs facing LGBTQ+ community of all kinds (transgender, intersex individuals, people with expansive gender or sexual orientations, gender identities, expression, youth, seniors) and discuss their responses to the six qualitative CHNA questions. The focus group participants specifically support the trans and nonbinary people residing in Northern Santa Barbara County and San Luis Obispo County. The Gala participants identified the greatest health needs as follows: They want to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their gender identity or sexual orientation. Access to culturally competent, respectful physicians, behavioral health providers, nurses, and office staff that accept CenCal. Many trans people are underemployed/unemployed, and finding health care that accepts their insurance is a \"huge\" problem. Focus group participants said they often feel they are treated as a \"piece of meat.\" Beyond cultural competency, many times health care is not specialized in addressing their health needs. They \"face an uphill battle accessing gender diverse health care\" and need local gender affirming providers and specialists that accept CenCal. There are currently only two known providers that take CenCal that specialize in the LGBTQ+ community. The focus group participants said they want to feel safe at medical facilities. They spoke of the harsh and discriminatory situations they often face when trying to access local providers and hospitals. Nonbinary people seem to be facing more discrimination in the health care system because they do not fit into a \"male\" or \"female\" box. 19 Community Health Needs Assessment - May 2022 Marian Regional Medical Center Many LGBTQ+ youth face bullying by other classmates and parents \"gate keep\" and put up \"roadblocks\" to children seeking care. Unaffirming families often impact the youth mental health and can have youth in crisis. MRMC Medically Vulnerable Pediatric Program The MRMC Medically Vulnerable Pediatric (MVP) Program cares for high-risk medically fragile infants and children following their discharge from the hospital. The program provides support to families at their homes, providing essential resources and helping them navigate the health care system for their high-risk pediatric family member, to ensure they thrive. Two separate sessions were held with families in the MVP program on January 28, 2022 and January 31, 2022. The sessions were an open discussion facilitated by Community Health Educators, Leticia Sanchez and Irene Castro, to discuss their responses to the six qualitative CHNA questions. Both conducted interviews with six families that participate in the MVP program. The participating families all resided in Santa Maria or Guadalupe and are monolingual in Spanish. During the two sessions, the families were aligned on the top three health needs they identified and were very similar with the last two health needs. The MVP families identified and prioritized the greatest health needs as follows: 1. COVID-19 and shortages in medical supplies, especially for those with medical needs. 2. The need for more doctors and therapists; more mental health programs. 3. Health care for all family members; no health insurance for parents. 4. Cost of health care and no affordable living. 5. Lack of health information. Not enough daycare for children/overpopulated schools. The MVP families also provided input on how they would address the needs and potential resources that may be available. This information will be incorporated into later sections of this CHNA Report and the Implementation Plan. The MVP families identified mental health and drugs and alcohol as the greatest youth health need in the community. The MVP families also said the schools need more healthy foods and better after school programs. The MVP families said they felt the greatest barrier to child wellness in the community was \"exposure to pesticides because most of the parents work in agriculture and they feel this might have some effect on their children and family.\" Other barriers to child wellness discussed by the MVP families included finances, mental health programs, healthy foods in school, and more schools/education. The full responses from the MVP families can be found in Appendix D. County Public Health Departments Representatives from the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department (SBPHD) and the San Luis Obispo County Public Health Department (SLOPHD) were initially approached in early 2021, regarding the CHNA process Dignity Health was initiating for their 2022 CHNA Report. During this time period COVID-19 was all consuming at both public health departments and 20 Community Health Needs Assessment - May 2022 Marian Regional Medical Center limited their ability to fully participate; however periodic status updates were provided to each public health department through 2021. In January 2022, a one-hour meeting was requested with each public health department to share the preliminary results of the community health survey and gather their feedback/input. On February 7 and 8, 2022, Dignity Health shared a presentation with each public health department that provided a status update of the CHNA process to date, shared preliminary results of the community survey, and requested their feedback/input. Both public health departments were complimentary of Dignity Health's ability to reach the most vulnerable population and agreed with the preliminary results. Both public health departments shared the desire to collaboratively approach the implementation strategy. Following the adoption of this CHNA, additional meetings will be scheduled with SBPHD and SLOPHD. Written Comments from 2019 CHNA MRMC and AGCH invited written comments on the most recent CHNA Report and Implementation Strategy both in the documents and on the web site, where they are widely available to the public. No written comments have been received at the time of the CHNA report development. Secondary Data Sources The CHNA includes a multitude of secondary data indicators that help illustrate the health of the community. Secondary data from local, county, state, and national sources were reviewed and includes data points about demographics, mortality, morbidity, social determinant of health, health behaviors, clinical care, health outcomes, and physical environment. A limitation of the secondary data was that it often pulls from a larger geographic area that does not align with the demographics of the MRMC and AGCH community. Additionally, not all secondary data was stratified by demographic characteristics, which limited the ability to identify health disparities. A multitude of primary and secondary data sources were evaluated and considered for this CHNA Report. The community health survey addressed COVID-19 and attempted to begin to document its impact to the community. Many secondary data sources are three to five years old and do not include the recent trends in health statistics including the detrimental changes in health due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This CHNA Report utilized the following secondary data sources, and, where possible, was compared directly to data collected during the community health survey providing a comparison of service area data to county, state, or national levels: California Cancer Registry; California Department of Education; California Department of Public Health; CDC Healthy People 2030; CDC Morbidity and Mortality; 21 Community Health Needs Assessment - May 2022 Marian Regional Medical Center Center for Disease Control (CDC) Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System; County Health Rankings and Roadmaps; Santa Barbara County Public Health Department; and, U.S. Census. All secondary data sources were thoroughly evaluated and every effort was made to use the best available data at the time of report publishing. While there are always data limitations, the assembled data, information, and analyses completed provide a comprehensive identification and description of significant community health needs. CHNA Report Preparers This CHNA Report and the preceding data collection process was completed as a collaborative effort between Marian Regional Medical Center's, Patty Herrera, MA, Manager of Community Health and Amanda Tamburro, MPH, Principal at Tamburro Consulting Group, LLC. Patty has been the champion of community health in Santa Barbara County since 1991. Patty has been responsible for the community health survey data collection process and compilation since 2016. Patty conducted the critical outreach to community partners and contracted and trained her staff, staff from Herencia Ind\u00edgena, and the promotores networks from both counties to conduct the health survey outreach. Patty also was responsible for managing the community health surveys collected and the data compilation. Amanda was responsible for data analysis and the report preparation. Amanda served as the primary author and lead researcher for the 2016 and 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment Reports for Marian Regional Medical Center, Arroyo Grande Community Hospital, and French Hospital Medical Center. 22 Community Health Needs Assessment - May 2022 Marian Regional Medical Center V. Assessment Data and FindingsThe data assessment for this CHNA Report will consist of a systematic review of the primary and secondary data sources mentioned above. The data assessment will compare the community against county, state, and national levels, as well as Healthy People 2030 (HP 2030) benchmarks. Data will be analyzed for health and social inequities, health indicators, health behaviors, and health conditions. The analysis will specifically note population segments that are particularly vulnerable or experiencing disproportionate unmet health needs or poor outcomes. Social Determinants of Health and Barriers to Care According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the conditions of the places where people live, learn, work, and play affect a wide range of health and quality of life risks and outcomes. These factors include economic stability, health care access and quality, education access and quality, neighborhood and built environment, and social and community context are known as the social determinants of health (SDOH). 13 SDOH contribute to a wide range of health disparities and inequities and are fundamental in assessing a community. Economic Stability Income influences all aspects of an individual's life, including the ability to secure housing, food, transportation, health care, and childcare. Income also impacts an individual's ability to maintain good physical and mental health. Employment status is linked to several barriers to care, including lack of health insurance, inability to pay for health care services and copays, and the inability to pay for transportation to health care appointments. According to the U.S. Census, American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates (2016-2020), 1 in 8 people or 12.6% of California residents live in poverty. These individuals are less likely to have access to health care, healthy food, stable housing, and opportunities for physical activity. Similarly, in Santa Barbara County, 12.9% of all residents live below the poverty level, and in San Luis Obispo County this number improves slightly to 11.1%.14 In the MRMC and AGCH communities, the poverty rates range from a low of 5.4% in Arroyo Grande to a high of 24.0% in Guadalupe. According to the U.S. Census, only two zip codes in the MRMC and AGCH community are exceeding the state poverty rate of 12.6%, including zip code 93458 (Santa Maria) and 93434 (Guadalupe). However, this secondary data does not include any recent community impacts due to the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the 2022 13 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2022.

This is an 11.7% increase in community members that do not have $300 in a savings account as compared to the 2019 CHNA results. Over half of the survey participants from zip codes 93458 (Santa Maria), 93454 (Santa Maria), and 93434 (Guadalupe) do not have $300 in a savings account. Also, over half of the community health survey participants (56.5%, n=435) reported having food insecurity/not having enough food, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, 26.1% (n=201) said they suffered a loss of job/employment due to the pandemic. The following figure depicts the percent of the total population from each community that are either living below 100% of the poverty level or 100 to 149% of the poverty level. Figure 3. Percent of Community Members Residing in Poverty15 The 2021 poverty guidelines published by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, published a poverty guideline of $12,880 for a one person household and $26,500 for a family of four.16 While the official poverty measure primarily accounts for the cost of food, the Real Cost Measure (RCM), published by the United Ways of California, factors costs related to housing, health care, child care, transportation and other basic needs to reveal what it really costs to live in California.

Of the 33% that do not earn sufficient income to meet basic needs, 97% of these households have at least one working adult. The RCM data for San Luis Obispo County found 26% of households living below the RCM, and in Santa Barbara County 36% of households were living below the RCM. In Santa Barbara County, 42% of all households and 38% of households in San Luis Obispo County spend more than 30% of their income on housing. The United Way RCM reports for Santa Barbara County and San Luis Obispo County can be found in Appendix E.17 Education Access and Quality Education has been described as the most important modifiable social determinant of health.18 Research has shown that lower educational attainment levels are linked with poor health, more stress, higher poverty, and lower self-efficacy. People with higher levels of education are more likely to be healthier and live longer. According to the U.S. Census, the highest level of education for the population age 25 and older in the MRMC and AGCH community was distributed as follows: 22.3% had less than a high school diploma or equivalent (or 32,438 individuals); 20.5% had high school graduate as their highest level of school completed; 32.6% had some college or an associate degree as their highest level of school completed; 16.1% had a bachelor's degree as their highest degree; and, 8.5% had completed an advanced degree such as a master's degree, professional degree or doctoral degree.19 The educational disparity increases as each zip code within the MRMC and AGCH community is examined. The following figure displays the percentage of the population over the age of 25 that completed high school or equivalent, as compared to the State of California. Less than half of the population (46.8%), over the age of 25, residing in zip code 93458 (Santa Maria) reported graduating high school (or equivalent). A similarly low high school completion rate of 55.7% can be found in 93434 (Guadalupe) and 70.6% in zip code 93454 (Santa Maria). 17 United Ways of California, 2022.

The following two charts were published by the California Department of Education and depict the highest level of parental education for students in Lucia Mar Unified and Santa Maria Joint Union High School. Children with less-educated parents are less likely to succeed in school. Children from low-income families, children with disabilities, and children who regularly experience social discrimination (i.e., bullying) are more likely to struggle with math and reading. 21 Figure 5.

Access to the outdoors, commerce, public safety, public transportation, clean water, clean air, sidewalks, parks all impact an individuals' decision-making process to further their wellness. While local industry is a source of employment and feeds the local economy, it at times may impact the physical environment, potentially exacerbating or increasing the risk factors for chronic disease. According to the 2020 Santa Barbara County Agricultural Production Report, Santa Barbara County had a reported gross agricultural production value of $1.8 billion.23 In order to produce the high value crops to meet industry standards, in 2018 the California Department of Pesticide Regulation (CA DPR) reported that 4,865,420 pounds of pesticide were used to treat 2,418,410 acres in Santa Barbara County. Similarly, 3,055,467 pounds of pesticide were used to treat 1,498,665 acres in San Luis Obispo County. Santa Barbara County was ranked 13th of all California counties for pounds of pesticide applied and San Luis Obispo County was ranked 16th.24 The Top 5 Pesticides used in each county are detailed as follows: Table 6. Top 5 Pesticides by Pounds - 201825 Santa Barbara County San Luis Obispo County Pesticide Pounds Pesticide Pounds 1. Chloropicrin 1,287,493 1. Sulfur 648,886 2. Sulfur 242,792 5.

Chloropicrin is listed by The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) as a lung damaging agent and is severely irritating to the lungs, eyes, and skin. Chloropicrin is used as a soil fumigant and historically was used as a chemical warfare agent (military designation, \"PS\") and a riot control agent.

The Air Quality Index, or AQI, is a standardized value that was developed by the EPA so the public understands whether air pollution levels are healthy or unhealthy. In 2020, Santa Barbara County had 79 \"moderate\" air quality days, 8 days that were unhealthy for sensitive groups, and 4 days that were unhealthy. A moderate air quality means that there is moderate health concern for individuals who are unusually sensitive to air pollution.28 The air quality in San Luis Obispo County in 2020 declined as a result of historic wildfire impacts when compared to previous years. Particulate concentration records for the county were broken with record highs measured on 10 days. Besides wildfire smoke, windblown dust continued to impact air quality in South County.29 According to the community health survey, 6.2% of survey participants responded that they have been diagnosed with asthma compared to 9.1% of individuals in 2019. According to the CDC, 8.7% of adults in Santa Barbara County and 9.1% of adults in San Luis Obispo County currently have asthma.30 Following the COVID-19 pandemic, the importance of access to broadband internet was amplified and disparities in access were exposed. In the MRMC and AGCH community broadband internet subscriptions vary by geographic location and are presented in the following figure. In zip code 93454 over 16% of the population reported no broadband internet subscription between 2015-2019. As more health systems are using internet-based communication and health care tools, internet access is important to improve health and health 26 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), 2022.

The HP2030 objective is to increase the proportion of adults with broadband access to the Internet. Figure 6. MRMC and AGCH Community Without Broadband Internet Social and Community Context The social and community context in which people live and work includes the relationships between neighbors and their social and civic connections. Social and community context can be evaluated through the following indicators: Discrimination; Incarceration and crime; Social cohesion and social connectedness; and, Community capacity. The MRMC and AGCH community is home to a number of churches, schools, gyms, parks, senior centers, and farmer's markets that can be used by the community and foster community engagement. An example of the multitude of community organizations supporting the MRMC and AGCH communities are provided in Section 7. According to the voting records for Santa HP 2030 Goal: Increase social and community support. 30 Community Health Needs Assessment - May 2022 Marian Regional Medical Center Barbara County, nearly 78% of registered voters cast ballots in the 2020 election for Santa Maria Mayor.31 Crime in the City of Santa Maria continues to plague this city and the overall number of crimes from 2020 to 2021 increased over 10% from 2020 levels. The City of Santa Maria Police Department reported the following crimes, as outlined below in 2020 and 2021.32 Part 1 Category 2020 2021 Homicide 2 6 Rape 81 66 Robbery 179 120 Aggravated Assault 572 435 Burglary 328 885 Larceny-Theft 1114 1149 Motor Vehicle Theft 1030 1058 Arson 22 23 Total Part 1 Crimes 3328 3742 While there were six homicides reported in 2021, there was a reported 121 shootings in Santa Maria during the same time period. In the first two weeks of January 2022 there were already 10 shootings in Santa Maria, and at least two people were killed between January 1 - March 15, 2022. Discrimination and bullying/teasing can have detrimental effects on an individual, especially students. One goal of HP 2030 is to reduce bullying of transgender students. According to the California Department of Education, between 2020-2021, 28% of 11th grade students at Santa Maria Joint Union High School reported being harassed or bullied in the past 12 months. At Lucia Mar Unified between 2019-2020, 30% of 11th grade students reported being harassed or bullied in the past 12 months.33 Aside from having broadband internet access as discussed above, understanding health conditions and having needed health literacy to understand health conditions are indicators of social and community context. As individuals use computers to better understand their health conditions, having social support (family and friends) to talk with is also important and improve health navigation. 31 Santa Barbara County Elections, 2020.

Inadequate health insurance coverage is one of the largest barriers to health care access, and the unequal distribution of coverage contributes to disparities in health. Out of pocket medical care costs may lead individuals to delay or forgo needed care (such as doctor visits, dental care, and medications), and medical debt is common among both insured and uninsured individuals. Vulnerable populations including seniors, Latino(a) (monolingual Spanish speaking), Indigenous, LGBTQ+, and homeless are particularly at risk for insufficient health insurance coverage; people with lower incomes are often uninsured and minorities account for over half of the uninsured population.34 The communities' ability to access health care was measured through multiple community health survey responses compared to secondary data. The qualitative survey responses identified access to health care and access to behavioral health care as the two greatest needs facing the community, including the youth population. Select details are presented on the following Table 6. Table 6.

Mortality The most recent publicly available mortality data is from 2020, published by both the CDC and also the California Health and Human Services Agency. A review of the 2020 California mortality data, by the California Department of Public Health, revealed that after many years of decreasing death rates in California, the rate increased substantially (15.9%) in 2020, and continued to increase in 2021. This increase in deaths, or excess mortality, is due to COVID-19 and other causes of death. The excess mortality differed by race/ethnicity, with the greatest increase among the Latino(a) population. Compared to prior years, deaths increased 34.1% among the Latino(a) population, and 7.8% among Whites. As the year continued, excess mortality increased within all racial groups, and the disparities between groups increased.36 The following two tables list the leading causes of death for Santa Barbara County and San Luis Obispo County in 2020. The tables also detail the leading causes of death for the Latino(a) population residing in each county in 2020. A full data table detailing total deaths and the age-adjusted rate per 100,000 for years 2018-2020 can be found in Appendix F. Table 7.

Top 5 Leading Causes of Death, Latino(a) Population - 202038 Santa Barbara County San Luis mellitus As depicted in the above tables, the leading causes of death in Santa Barbara County is heart disease, followed closely by cancer. In San Luis Obispo County, cancer was the leading cause of death followed closely by heart disease. While the leading cause of death differs for each county, heart disease and cancer can be attributed to approximately 42-43% of all deaths occurring between 2018-2020 in Santa Barbara County and San Luis Obispo County. In San Luis Obispo County and Santa Barbara County, accidents (unintentional injuries) w ere the third leading cause of death for the Latino(a) community (between 2018-2020). Intentional self-harm (suicide) was the tenth leading cause of death in Santa Barbara County in 2020. 39 The top five leading causes of death for Californians between 2018 -2020, were as follows: 1.Heart disease, 2.Cancer, 3.Alzheimer disease, 4.Cerebrovascular diseases, and 5.Accidents (unintentional injuries). While the state results mirror the leading causes of death in Santa Barbara County, it differs from San Luis Obispo County data. Similarly, heart disease and cancer were listed as the cause of death for 43% of all deaths in California. 40 One length of life measure is premature death, which is tabulated through the years of potential life lost before age 75 per 100,000 (age-adjusted). Secondary data for the years of potential life lost (YPLL) from 2017-2019 was available at the national, state, and county level. Overall, the State of California is considered the healthiest state in the nation for having the lowest years of potential life lost before age 75 (5,703 years), compared to the national rate of 7,337 years. 41 The YPLL for Santa Barbara County and San Luis Obispo County was 5,200 years each.42 38 Ibid 3 7. 39 Ibid 3 7. 40 Ibid 3 7. 41 United Health Foundation (2022).

The county health status profile provides additional information regarding mortality, morbidity, infant mortality, and natality. Chronic Conditions Chronic disease and injury are reported as the leading cause of death, disability, and diminished quality of life in the U.S. and California. Chronic diseases are defined as conditions that last more than one year and require ongoing medical attention or limit activities of daily living or both. Chronic conditions many times are caused by unhealthy or risky behaviors, such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet, lack of physical activity, and excessive alcohol use.43 Chronic conditions also encompass mental health conditions, including depression and anxiety. Heart Disease and Stroke According to the American Heart Association, cardiovascular disease can refer to a number of different conditions including coronary artery disease, heart attack, stroke, heart failure, arrhythmia, and heart valve problems. Heart disease risk factors include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, obesity, an individual's lifestyle, age, and family history. In 2020, diseases of the heart was the leading cause of death in Santa Barbara County and the second leading cause of death in San Luis Obispo County. The community health survey included questions that are considered risk factors for heart disease and stroke. These indicators are presented on the following Table 9 and compared to state and national levels. Table 9.

The community health survey asked participants (Q25) if they were ever told by a doctor they had diabetes, pre-diabetes, or gestational diabetes. Primary and secondary data sources were evaluated and presented on the following table. Table 10. Diabetes Prevalence Have you ever been told by a doctor you have diabetes? 2022 CHNA (N=770) 1.8% The community health survey revealed pre-diabetes and gestational diabetes rates approximately twice the state level. Survey participants reporting a diabetes diagnosis in 2022 is below 2019 levels, but still above state and national levels. Cancer As mentioned above, in 2020 cancer was the leading cause of death in San Luis Obispo County and the second leading cause of death in Santa Barbara County. Aside from cancer screening tests, there are vaccines and healthy choices that can reduce an individual's risk of cancer, such as limiting alcohol and tobacco use, skin protection, maintaining a healthy weight, and physical fitness. Cancer disparities are thought to reflect the relationship of socioeconomic factors, culture, diet, stress, the environment, and biology. The poor and medically underserved are less likely to have recommended cancer screening tests than those who are medically well served. They are also more likely to be diagnosed with late-stage cancer that may have been treated more effectively if diagnosed earlier.46 According to the California Cancer Registry, between 2015 and 2017, 6,236 cancer cases occurred in Santa Barbara County and 4,855 occurred in San Luis Obispo County. The California Cancer Registry determined the crude rate of cancer for each county and then adjusted 45 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Division of Population Health (2022).

Female survey participants over the age of 40, were asked if they received a mammogram in the past year. According to 2022 community health survey, 67.8% (n=196) of females over the age of 40 reported receiving a mammogram in the past year. Further evaluation into the health insurance status of females age 40 and older revealed the following: 47 California Cancer Registry (2022).

Age-Adjusted Cancer Mortality Rates in California, All Sites, 2013-2017. https://www.cancer-rates.info/ca/ 37 Community Health Needs Assessment - May 2022 Marian Regional Medical Center For women age 40 and over, 28.9% (n=50) with health insurance and 36.9% (n=24) without health insurance did not receive their annual mammogram. Nearly 61.5% of women (n=123), age 40 and over, without health insurance, reported receiving their annual mammogram in the community health survey. While the number of survey participants reporting an annual mammogram is a decrease of approximately 10% from the 2019 community health survey results, it is most likely the result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Community health survey participants over the age of 45 were asked about their colorectal screening habits and if they ever had a lifetime colonoscopy. Additional questions were asked of survey participants to determine if they ever were screened for lung cancer through a CT scan, as well as a prostate cancer screening question. The community health survey results related to cancer prevention have been tabulated and are provided on the following table. Table 13. Cancer Prevention Prevalence Cancer Screening Questions 2022 CHNA CDC BRFSS49 California U.S. Lifetime N/A N/A Health Behaviors Healthy behaviors can help reduce an individual's risk of developing chronic conditions and improve mental wellness. These healthy behaviors include maintaining a healthy weight, avoiding tobacco, limiting the amount of alcohol consumed, and physical fitness. The status of these health behaviors was measured through several community health survey questions. Obesity, Diet and Exercise Body mass index (BMI) for each participant was calculated based on self-reported height and weight. When BMI was calculated for the community health survey participants, over 76% of all 2022 community health survey participants responding to this question (n=500) had BMIs considered overweight or obese. BMI measurements that fall within the range of 18.5 to 24.9 are considered to be normal weight. BMI measurements between 25.0 and 29.9 are considered to be overweight and those greater than 30.0 are considered obese. Overall, 62.9% of community 49 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Division of Population Health (2022). BRFSS Prevalence & Trends Data (online). 2020 Data. https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/brfssprevalence/ 38 Community Health Needs Assessment - May 2022 Marian Regional Medical Center health survey participants reported participating in an exercise or physical activity at least three times per week. Smoking Community health survey participants were asked two questions related to their smoking habits. Survey participants were asked if they ever smoked on average at least one pack of cigarettes per day for 20 years, or two packs a day for 10 years. Overall 6.6% or 50 individuals, out of 752, responded \"yes\" to this question. Furthermore, community health survey participants were asked if they used any of the following the products in the past 30 days, this includes cigarettes, e-cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos, chewing tobacco, pipes, or smoking marijuana. Cigarettes were used the most, with 4.5% of survey participants saying they used cigarettes in the past 30 days. Approximately 2% of survey participants said they used e-cigarettes or vape, and similarly, 2% said they smoked marijuana. According to the California Healthy Kids Survey, 6% of 11th grade students in Santa Maria Joint Union High School (2020-2021 data) reported currently vaping. However, 18% of 11th grade students at Lucia Mar Unified (2019-2020 data) reported currently vaping.50 Social and Emotional Wellness Social and emotional wellness includes our emotional well-being, psychological well-being, and social well-being. Social and emotional wellness is essential to a person's overall well-being. Intentional harm was ranked as the 10th leading cause of death between 2018-2020 in Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo Counties.51 According to the CDC's 500 Cities and PLACES Data in 2019, 13.1% of adults in Santa Barbara County reported their mental health was not good for more than 14 days in the past month, and 12.9% of adults in San Luis Obispo County.52 As previously stated, this secondary data from 2019 is not representative of the social and emotional impact on the community due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Over 15% of 2022 community health survey participants responded that they (or a member of their household) needed to talk to a health care professional about problems like stress, emotional problems, family, drugs, or alcohol. The most commonly encountered social and emotional conditions at MRMC are anxiety, possible alcohol concern, and depression. Research suggests that LGBTQ+ individuals face health disparities linked to societal stigma, discrimination, and denial of their civil and human rights. Discrimination against LGBTQ+ persons has been associated with high rates of psychiatric disorders, substance abuse, and suicide. 50 California Department of Education (CDE) (2019).

Prioritized Description of Significant Community Health Needs The significant community health needs identified for the MRMC and AGCH community extend far beyond health and health care. Social factors, including education, employment status, income level, gender, and ethnicity all contribute to health inequities. According to the CDC, racial and ethnic minority groups throughout the United States experience higher rates of illness and death across a wide range of health conditions, including diabetes, hypertension, obesity, asthma, and heart disease, when compared to their White counterparts.55 Health inequities are systematic differences in the health status of different population groups. These inequities have significant social and economic costs both to individuals and societies. Health inequities can be best addressed by setting a goal to attain health equity in the community. Health equity is the state in which everyone has a fair and just opportunity to attain their highest level of health. The significant community health needs were thoughtfully determined by the Dignity Health Community Health Education Department. Primary and secondary quantitative data, as well as the qualitative data and the anecdotal stories all pointed to the following priorities. The same concerns and needs consistently rose to the surface and were repeated time and time again. In accordance with Dignity Health policy, the following criteria were also utilized to evaluate the prioritization of community needs, including: Size or scale of problem (how many impacted); Severity of problem; Disparity and equity; Known effective interventions; Resource feasibility and sustainability; and, Community support. Attaining health equity in the MRMC and AGCH community will require addressing the greatest disparities and helping the pockets of the community that are facing a constant uphill battle with everyday life. The following paragraphs provide a prioritized list of the significant health needs identified through the CHNA. Priority 1: Educational attainment Low levels of adult educational attainment was identified in the 2016 CHNA, the 2019 CHNA, and now again in this 2022 CHNA Report. Educational attainment is one of the five social determinants of health, and low educational attainment levels are linked with poor health, more stress, higher poverty, and lower self-efficacy. Overall, 22.3% of the MRMC and AGCH 55 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2022. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Health Equity. Retrieved from https://www.cdc.gov/healthequity/racism-disparities/index.html. 41 Community Health Needs Assessment - May 2022 Marian Regional Medical Center community (or 32,438 individuals) over the age of 25 did not graduate high school or e quivalent. However, the 2022 community health survey found that 73.9% (n=568) survey participants reported they did not complete high school (or equivalent). The high school graduation rate (age 25 and over) for the MRMC and AGCH community is below the state level of 83.9% in the following communities: 93458 (Santa Maria) - 46.8%; 93434 (Guadalupe) Maria) - (Oceano) - 78.4%. A review of parents' educational attainment for the Santa Maria Joint Union High found t hat the parents of almost 35% of 11 th grade students did not finish high school. Children with less - educated parents are less likely to succeed in school, and they may not reach their full potential. Priority 2: Access to primary health care, behavioral health care, and oral health The need for an improvement in access to primary health care, behavioral health care, and oral health has been substantiated through primary data, secondary data, and HRSA. HRSA has designated two medically underserved communities within the MRMC and AGCH community, including Guadalupe (MUA/P ID: 00301) and Arroyo Grande (MUA/P: 00395). Mental health professional shortages were designated for the low income migrant farmworker populati on in Santa Solvang/Lompoc/Guadalupe (HPSA ID: 7062778515). Even if the community was not struggling with documented shortages of health care providers and medically underserved areas, inadequate health insurance cover age is one of the largest barriers to health care access. The vulnerable populations within the MRMC and AGCH community, include seniors, Latino(a) (monolingual Spanish speaking individuals), Indigenous, homeless, and LGBTQ+ individuals. These vulnerable communities are well documented as being either uninsured, or underinsured, and face limited providers willing to treat them unless they can private pay. In addition, the vulnerable populations do not have jobs that offer them paid time off, or sick time, to leave work and go to a middle of the day physician's appointment or preventative screening. If they do take the time off of work, they will lose their pay for the day or potentially their position. Many are faced with choosing between going to a doctor or keeping their job and feeding their family. Aside from difficulty in accessing all types of health care, the vulnerable populations including the aging community struggle with navigating the health care system. The lack of educational attainment mentioned and language barrier creates a situation that many find intimidating and difficult to navigate. 42 Community Health Needs Assessment - May 2022 Marian Regional Medical Center Priority 3: Health promotion and prevention Heart disease and cancer are the leading causes of death at local, state, and national levels. As documented above, the most vulnerable members of the MRMC and AGCH community struggle to access health care. If the vulnerable communities are struggling to access health care, they are less likely to understand their current health status and access preventative cancer screenings. Besides difficulty accessing health care, the vulnerable communities face increased risk for heart disease and cancer due to their social determinants of health. They face food insecurity and more often live in areas that have higher levels of pollution. In order to help the most vulnerable communities reduce their chances of developing heart disease, cancer, or another chronic condition, targeted upstream health promotion and prevention is needed. Therefore, health promotion and prevention is the third significant health need within this CHNA Report. Within the MRMC and AGCH community, approximately 45% (n=334) of the 2022 community health survey participants had a lifetime cholesterol check. If the responses are filtered for health insurance status, 60.5% those survey participants with health insurance have had their cholesterol checked. Meanwhile an early indicator for heart disease in the majority of survey participants is unknown. Another risk factor for heart disease is obesity. Over 76% of the 2022 survey participants had BMIs that were considered overweight or obese. The 2022 community health survey asked multiple questions regarding survey participants' cancer screening history. Overall 67.8% (n=196) of female survey participants over the age of 40 reported receiving a mammogram in the past year. Community health survey participants over the age of 45 were asked about their colorectal screening habits and if they ever had a lifetime colonoscopy. Only 51.3% (n=157) of eligible survey participants reported having a lifetime colonoscopy. Lastly, good health requires proper nutrition. Over half of the community health survey participants (56.5%, n=435) reported having food insecurity/not having enough food, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 43 Community Health Needs Assessment - May 2022 Marian Regional Medical Center VII. Resources Potentially Available to Address Needs While potential resources are available to address the needs of the community, the needs are too significant for any one organization. Making a substantial and upstream impact will require the collaborative efforts of community organizations, local government, local business leaders, and institutions. The greater Santa Maria Valley and \"Five Cities\" area are home to a wealth of organizations, businesses, and non-profits, including colleges and universities within each county. The resources potentially available to address the identified significant health needs includes the following organizations, facilities, and programs: Educational Attainment Alan Hancock Community College Boys and Girls Club, Oceano Boys and Girls Club, Santa Maria Catholic Churches City of Santa Maria, Recreation and Parks Department County of Santa Barbara San Luis Obispo County Cuesta College Discovery Museum Five Cities Homeless Coalition Little House by the Park (Guadalupe Family Resource Center) Local Agriculture Other Shelters Santa Maria Valley YMCA United Way University of California, Santa Barbara Cal Poly Future Leaders of America Inc.

Impact of Actions Taken Since the Preceding CHNA Following the 2019 CHNA Report and Implementation Plan, MRMC and AGCH worked tirelessly to address the identified health needs. Several new programs were initiated, including a new Street Medicine Program that is now in its second year of service. Since July 2019, MRMC and AGCH faithfully provided $69,123,975 in community benefits, detailed in the following table. Table 15. MRMC & AGCH Community Benefits Summary, FY20 and FY21 Period 7/1/2019 - 6/30/2020 7/1/2020 - 6/30/2021 Community Benefit Category Persons Net Benefit Persons Net Benefit Benefits for Poor Financial Assistance 7,869 $6,293,237 Community Community Totals for BENEFIT 136,175 $26,415,845 132,376 $42,708,130 In addition to addressing the identified 2019 community health needs, MRMC and AGCH expended an unprecedented effort and focus on helping the community through the COVID-19 pandemic. When the stay home orders and COVID-19 restrictions began to be lifted, MRMC remained vigilant and proactive in collaborating with Santa Barbara County Public Health, and accessing the needs of our community partners. Due the resurgence of COVID-19 and the Delta Variant, the bilingual COVID-19 Information line was reactivated and staffed by the MRMC Community Health Department with the focus of assisting those callers needing help obtaining a vaccine appointment. Bilingual vaccine public service announcements were developed and aired on the local radio stations and television stations. Ongoing collaboration efforts between Santa Barbara County Public Health, Community Health Centers of the Central Coast, and MRMC Community Education focused on developing COVID-19 vaccine education outreach to the Latino(a) population which resulted in the establishing mobile vaccine clinics in strategic neighborhoods in San Luis Obispo County. Besides addressing the unexpected impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2019 CHNA Report identified the following health needs: Educational attainment; Access to primary health care, including behavioral health; Aging, more mature population; and Chronic disease and management. 47 Community Health Needs Assessment - May 2022 Marian Regional Medical Center The following subsections provide select details and impacts from the various community benefit programs currently addressing each 2019 identified health need.

For detailedmethodology, visit http://unitedwaysca.org/realcost.The Real Cost Measure (RCM) estimates the amount of income required to meet basic needs (the \"Real Cost Budget\") for a given household type in a specific community. The Real Cost Measure builds a bare-bones budget that reflects constrained yet reasonable choices for essential expenses: housing, food, transportation, health care, taxes and child care.If any results show blank values, that indicates the sample size is too small to illustrate Real Cost Measure results. Per our methodology, estimates with a cell size of greater than 5,000 are assumed to be accurate within +/-1% based on design factor analysis. Cell sizes less than 5,000 are suppressed.
