In light of the recent economic crisis, the economic burden associated with unsafe patient care received more attention. Member States have set efforts to cut expenditures and to improve efficiency in their health care systems. In addition to increased cost of healthcare services , unsafe care also leads to loss of trust in health care systems by the public and diminished satisfaction by patients and health care professionals. Patient safety programmes may prevent and reduce such adverse events which ultimately result s in less harm inflicted to patients. According to the Council of the European Union, a large proportion of adverse events both in the hospital sector and in primary care are preventable . Contextual systemic factors play an important role . The three main o bjectives of this study are: To provide a comprehensive picture of the financial impact of poor patient safety, including poor prevention and control of healthcare -associated infections, on Eur o- pean Union's health systems; To identify cost -effective patie nt safety programmes implemented in the EU/EEA Member States and develop an analysis identifying their success factors; To assess cost -effectiveness and efficiency of investment in patient safety pr o- grammes. To answer the research questions, a mix of dif ferent methods was used. A systematic literature search as well as hand search for evidence on prevalence and costs of adverse events and cost -effective patient safety programmes was conducted. An expert panel was consulted to complement results from liter ature where necessary. To calculate the economic burden of adverse events and cost -effectiveness of patient safety programmes we developed computational procedures in Microsoft Excel , which can be made available for decision makers. The literature on unsaf e care clearly shows that the burden resulting from adverse events is substantial . Results show a general prevalence of adverse events in 4 - 17 percent of all patients. Calculations based on two European references show an economic burden for the public hea lth care sector with direct costs of about EUR 21 billion or 1.5 percent of health expenditure for EU member -states in 2014 . Identified epidemiological studies have only limited value for answering the research questions of this study. Publications primary focuses on very specific events and give insufficient information on adverse event groups defined in this study's context. Besides that, studies with adequate information feature wide ranges in results for identical adverse events within countries , regions and cities and lack representativ e- ness for EU member states. Most information on the occurrence of adverse events focuses on inpatient care. Considerably less information is available regarding adverse events in outpatient (primary) care. Data av ailability on cost of singular adverse events is dissatisfactory and allows few statements on the exact level of costs and their variation between different member states or on the factors leading to higher or lower economic burden. Few figures on costs ar e available, and the small number of exi sting studies features a large variation in estimates . This is due to small sample sizes, differen ces in methods employed , cost categories included and definition s of time horizon. Many of the available studies appea r to be of low quality, with low transparency on exact methodology and data sources applied and with few standards allowing the comparison of studies across settings and types of adverse events. In conclusion, the extensive review of the Costs of unsafe care and cost -effectiveness of patient safety programmes February, 2016 9 literature finds t hat further primary studies of epidemiology and costs of adverse events are needed in order to gain a better grasp of the exact size of economic burden and factors influencing its magnitude. The l iterature search on cost-effective patient safety programmes yielded a large number of publications . No studies reported inefficient programmes ; only one cost - neutral study was identified. The reported interventions show that a promising programme is based on a multi -methodological approach. Efficient programmes can be developed by the organisation itself or existing programmes can be adapted for implementation. Employees of all professions have to be involved. A basic simulation model was established to transfer information from existing cost - effective patient safety programmes to the specific setting of EU member -states. The model calculates costs, effects, cost -effectiveness ratios and savings from selected patient safety programmes on country level for member states. Calculation for three selected programmes estimate EU-wide savings of EUR 300 million for a programme to reduce several HAI, about EUR 2 billion for a programme to reduce pressure ulcers and about EUR 6 billion for implementing an electronic medication ordering system, consisting of a computerized physician order entry system with a Clinical Decision Support System to prevent adverse drug events. This report also aims to give recommendations on the prioritisation of patient safety programmes on the basis of identified studies and calculated cost -efficiency figures. In a first step , the Council Recommendations of the European Union are reviewed and matched with the results of the identified literatur e. In a second step this study gives recommendations on how to choose between two or more patient safety programmes. In order to make a prioritisation on patient safety programmes a number of key indicators of programmes must be taken into consideration. T hese indicators are the prevalence of the adverse event , the relevance of (easily preventable) adverse events and the (established) cost -effectiveness of available patient safety practices. Relative cost -utility would be an ideal indicator for prioritisin g patient safety pro- grammes; however the application of this indicator is problematic for several reasons. Due to scant evidence on patient safety programmes' cost -utility ratios and high variability in baseline prevalence of adverse events among hospitals, this study recommends that prioritization of programmes must follow a process that inclu des an assessment of patient safety deficits in the specific setting, the identification of appropriate patient safety practices, a formulation of a precise implementation strategy and the incorporation of new guidelines (where appropriate) and training of staff. In a final task, this study aims to give recommendations on further economic asses s- ment of patient safety programmes. The best choice for cost -effectiveness and efficiency indicators depends on the nature of the adverse event that is to be preven t- ed by the intervention. For performing economic burden studies and cost -effectiveness analyses in patient safety i t is essential to systematically collect data on patient safety related incidents, and obtain reliable cost figures for these adverse events i n European countries, with a special focus on countries where such studies have not yet been performed. Periodic monitoring of patient safety indicators can potentially assist in setting priorities for patient safety policy. However, data on prevalence of adverse events is not accurate enough to draw conclusions regarding regional differences or trends in patient -safety related indicators. These limitations need to be addressed before systematic assessment of efficiency of patient safety programmes can be performed. Costs of unsafe care and cost -effectiveness of patient safety programmes February, 2016 10 We thus deem any routine/periodical evaluation of economic burden or efficiency of medical care as not feasible.

Ein gilt of unsafe care and cost -effectiveness of patient safety programmes February, 2016 16 Abstract English BACKGROUND & AIMS: Given the growing importance of patient safety not only for health systems but first and for emost for patients, it is necessary to assess the impact of patient safety efforts and to develop priorities for action. The three main objectives of this study are (1) to provide a comprehensive picture of the financial impact of poor patient safety, incl uding poor prevention and control of healthcare -associated infe c- tions, on European Union's health systems; (2) to identify cost -effective patient safety programmes implemented in the EU/EEA Member States and develop an analysis identifying their success fa ctors and (3) to assess cost -effectiveness and efficiency of investment in patient safety programmes. METHODS: The applied mix of different methods contains a systematic and literature search by hand for identification of evidence on prevalence and costs o f adverse events and cost -effective patient safety programmes. Subsidiary an expert panel was consulted to complement results from the literature review . Economic burden of adverse events and cost -effectiveness of patient safety programmes were calculated by own calculation . RESULTS: In general, about 4 -17 percent of patients experience adverse events, whereby 44 -50 percent of these events are preventable. The economic burden for the public health care sector was about EUR 21 billion of direct costs or 1.5 percent of health expenditure for EU member -states in 2014 . A mayor finding of this study is that primary studies of epidemiology and costs of adverse events are needed. Another question that arises with the economic burden of adverse events is the perspec tive of costs and who bears the costs in different systems. The literature search on cost- effective patient safety programmes identified a large number of studies. Calculation for three selected programmes suggest possible EU-wide savings of EUR 300 million for a programme to reduce several HAI, about EUR 2 billion for a programme to reduce pressure ulcers and about EUR 6 billion for implementing an electronic medic a- tion ordering system. CONCLUSION: In order to make a priori tisation on patient safety programmes, key indicators of programmes must be taken into consideration: the prevalence of the problem, the relevance of adverse events and the cost -effectiveness of patient safety practices. Relative cost-utility would be the preferable indicator for prioritising patient safety programmes. Regarding recommendations on cost -effectiveness and efficiency indicators, the best choice for cost -effectiveness or efficiency indicators depends on the nature of the adverse event that is t o be avoided by the intervention. For a framework and guidelines for performing economic burden studies and cost - effectiveness analyses it is essential to systematically collect data on patient safety related incidents, and obtain reliable cost figures for these adverse events. For a feasibility analysis on periodical surveillance based on economic burden studies and cost-effectiveness and efficiency analyses in patient safety programmes, periodic monitoring of patient safety indicators would ideally assist in setting priorities for patient safety policy. However, data on prevalence of adverse events is not accurate enough to draw conclusions regarding regional differences or trends in patient -safety related indicators . These limitations need to be addressed before systematic asses s- ment of efficiency of patient safety programmes can be performed.

Patient safety programmes may prevent and reduce adverse events , which ultimately result s in less harm inflicted to patients. According to the Council of the European Union, a large proportion of adverse events, both in the hospital sector and in primary care, are preventable . Contextual systemic factors cause a large proportion of adverse events [1]. Thus, it appears as if the majority of errors or adverse events in health care that lead to harm of patients are not caused by individuals but by faulty systems, processes and conditions that lead people to commit mistakes or shortage of prevention [2]. Hence, it is expected that the economic burden faced by EU/EEA countries could be reduced through patient safety pro- grammes. This stands in contrast with traditional approaches to unsafe care and patient safety which assume that well -trained and conscientious health professionals would not commit errors and thus equated error with incompetence. This explains why the reporting of errors resulting in the occurrence of adverse events could not be esta b- lished as a culture for a long time. Only in the 1990s it was recognized that errors of health care professionals may also result from errors in the health system such as errors in organisation, management, training and equipment. Furthermore, it was realized that information on the occurrence of advers e events can provide useful insights for their avoidance [3]. At this point there was a culture shift from a culture of punishing errors towards a new 'safety culture' which emphasized reporting and learning and aimed at reducing adverse events through systematic approaches. In the light of growing importance of patient safety not only for health systems but first and foremost for patients, it is necessary to assess the impact of patient safety efforts and to develop priorities for action. European efforts Already since the early 2000s , patient safety has been a priority topic on the European policy agenda and many initiatives have been taken on national levels. While some countries used legislative measures to stimulate improvement in patient safety others considered softer solutions su ch as guidelines, standards, plans or campaigns as appropriate instruments. Some countries made use of contracts and agreements as well as platforms and databases. A common initiative at the national level has been the accreditation of health care services to improve patient safety [4]. The European Commission helps its member countries to coordinate these national efforts to protect and foster public health by making them share best practice and set actions to improve patient safety in Europe [5]. In 2009 the Council Recommendation on patient safety and healthcare associated infections laid down an EU -wide strategy Costs of unsafe care and cost -effectiveness of patient safety programmes February, 2016 20 on patient safety, focussing on 1) policies and programmes on patient safety, 2) empowering patients, 3) reporting adverse events and learning from errors, and 4) education and training of healthcare workers [1]. Just recently - in October 2014 - the independent Expert Panel on effective ways on investing in heal th (EXPH), which advises the European Commission adopted its opinion on the Future EU Agenda on Patient Safety and Quality of Health Care [6]. Accordingly, all services of health care should fulfil the criteria of being effective, safe, appropriate, patient -centred, efficient and equ itable in order to improve the quality of health care and patient safety. Economic burden of adverse events In light of the recent economic crisis, the economic burden associated with unsafe patient care received more attention. Although scarce public resources have increa s- ingly become contested during the past decade due to the economic crisis, health systems i n Europe are continuing to experience increasing expenditures in healthcare. Member States have therefore set efforts to cut expenditures and to improve efficie n- cy in their health care systems [7]. In addition to its financial impacts, unsafe care is also costly in terms of loss of trust in health care systems by the public and diminished satisfaction by patients and health care professionals [2]. According to the Council of the European Union, poor patient safety represents both a severe public health problem as well as a high economic burden on limited health resources [1]. The prevention or reduction of unsafe care or adverse events, defined as 'incidents which result in harm to a patient' [1], does therefore not only contribute to an incr ease in quality of care for patients but also to a reduction of the economic burden incurred by national health systems. Adverse events may harm health outcomes or cause increased morbidity, temporary or permanent disability or death due to a lack or low performance of health care. Adverse events are related to different types of errors. Most frequently, errors in health care occur during prevention (e.g. lack of monitoring), diagnosis (e.g. late correct diagnosis, contraindications, delay in administratio n etc.) or treatment (e.g. wrong -side surgery, medication errors, errors related to medical equipment, errors in nursing). Other causes are, for example, infections or bad communication among health care professionals. Furthermore, errors may occur in ever y place of care - in hospitals as well as primary care institutes and in specialised ambulatory care, long - term care and in transition from hospital to outpatient care [8]. Especially vulnerable populations such as pregnant women, children or elderly are often subject to suffering from adverse events. For example, falls and decubitus ulcers are widespread adverse events among the elderly population. Reliable information on the occurrence of adverse events is more likely to be available for inpatient care, as documentation is mostly standardized. The European Commi s- sion's patient safety policy [5] estimates that 8 to 12 percent of patients admitted to hospitals suffer from adverse events, for example healthcare -associated infec tions, medication -related errors, surgical errors, medical device failures, errors in diagnosis or failures to act on the results of tests. Considerably less information is available regarding adverse events in outpatient (primary) care. Errors may occur d uring the diagnosis stage (missed or delayed diagnosis), treatment (often related to medication) and preventive services. Process errors may be clinical (judgement, decision making, etc.), communicational (p a- tient/physician, physician/health care provider) or administrational (insurance and government regulations) [9]. Costs of unsafe care and cost -effectiveness of patient safety programmes February, 2016 21 2 Objectives According to the European Council's recommendation on patient safety, including the prevention and control of healthcare associated infections [1]and the implementation report on patient safe ty [7], more evidence on the cost -effectiveness of patient safety programmes is required. The study aims to investigate costs of unsafe care and cost -effectiveness of patient safety programmes in response to adverse events. The specific objectives are : To provide a comprehensive picture of the financial impact of poor patient safety, including poor prevention and control of healthcare -associated infections, on Eur o- pean Union's health systems; To identify cost -effective patient safety programmes implemented in the EU/EEA Member States and develop an analysis identifying their success factors; To assess cost -effectiveness and efficiency of investment in patient safety pr o- grammes. Furthermore, clear recommendations on how to prioritize patient safety strategies to achieve an improvement in unsafe care will be presented. Representation of adverse events The wide range of adverse events and their occurrence across every typ e of care has led to specialized investigations focused on single, specific events or broader studies focusing on special groupings of adverse events. Due to a lack of comprehensive information it is considered useful to estimate the impact of adverse even ts on an aggregate, systematic level. The starting point and basis of this project is an aggr e- gated list of the following adverse events: errors in diagnosis acute care adverse events/adverse events due to surgical errors adverse drug events healthcare ass ociated infections medical devices adverse events adverse events due to unsafe blood products adverse events due to falls injury due to pressure sores and decubitus ulcers This aggregation brings the advantage of delivering a workable basis for the complex field of adverse events. A full list of all possible single adverse events would due to its complexity neither be clearly arranged nor complete. The disadvantage of an aggreg a- tion lies in double counts of adverse events and generalization of conclusions. A final list of aggregated adverse events will be developed in the course of this project by extracted liter ature and expert consultations in chapter 5.3. Costs of unsafe care and cost -effectiveness of patient safety programmes February, 2016 22 3 Activities and Deliverables To reach these objectives mentioned in the previous chapter , 13 tasks are created (see Figure 1). The whole process was supported by project management activities. Figure 1: Tasks to be implemented in this project Source: CHAFEA Costs of unsafe care and cost -effectiveness of patient safety programmes February, 2016 23 4 Expert Panel 4.1 Aim For some tasks a consultation of experts with expertise in management of patient safety programmes or costing analysis and cost -effectiveness analysis in the health care sector was foreseen and required. The main aim of the panel was to validate results from the literat ure review , provide further information on publications and advise the project team in terms of the methods used. The project team enlisted 15 experts from different EU/EEA Member States plus the WHO representing a well -balanced mix of medical, nursing, m anagerial and research staff. Experts have demonstrated expertise in either management of patient safety programmes with over 5 years of experience cove ring relevant adverse events, or in costing analysis and cost -effectiveness analysis in the health secto r with at least 4 relevant peer reviewed publications in the last 10 years. The members of the panel were identified by consulting EU -wide and national patient safety organisations as well as screening the results of the literature search for adequate cand idates. 4.2 Methodology The systematic method used for interviewing was a Delphi process . Experts were presented with a questionnaire including the preliminary list of adverse events according to literature and meta -analysis. Experts were then asked to confine and complete the list by adding adverse events they believe to be missing, or eliminating events they consider less important and providing brief justifications for doing so. Further, they are asked to comment on the general adequacy of the list, for instance on aggr egation and grouping of events. In the same questionnaire, experts are interviewed regarding prevalence rates , proportion of adverse event and degree of preventability of the adverse events listed. If data is available, pre valence rates are derived from literature and refined by meta -analyses and are presented and experts are able to evaluate whether they believe given figures to be correct or whether they regard th em to be biased up or downwards . In the case of adverse even ts for which there is no prevalence rate available, experts shall provide their best estimates. Degree of preventability of adverse events was judged on a traffic light scale, asking experts for their judgement on whether certain adverse events could be ea sily, to an average extent, or only avoided with great difficulty. Beside the two interviewing rounds, selected experts were consulted to provide assistance in terms of methods for calculating the economic burden of adverse events and developing cost -effectiveness and efficiency indicators of patient safety pr o- grammes . 4.3 Results A major finding from the feedback of the experts was that their knowledge , just as the information from literature, is limited at an aggregate level of adverse events. The experts hav e in-depth knowledge of certain singular adverse events and cannot provide information for adverse event groups. The results of the expert panel consultations are provided directly in the results part s below. Costs of unsafe care and cost -effectiveness of patient safety programmes February, 2016 24 5 Financial impact of unsafe care 5.1 Aim The aim was to provide a comprehensive picture of the financial impact of poor patient safety, including poor prevention and control of healthcare -associated infections, on European Union's health systems. The following research questions will be addressed : What prevalence may be estimated and attributed to adverse events according to the scientific literature? Which costs and costing methods for adverse events are used in the scientific literature? What methodological approach may be used to calculate the aggrega ted cost of adverse events respectively the economic burden of unsafe care in Europe? What is the economic burden of selected adverse events in EU/EEA Member States? 5.2 Methodology 5.2.1 Find evidence on adverse events, their prevalence and costs (Task 3) The systematic literature search for evidence on prevalence and costs of adverse events was conducted by linking different search terms regarding adverse events ( e.g. unsafe care, adverse reaction, adverse effect, patient safety, administration/process/su rgical/medical/diagnosis error, etc. ), prevalence (e.g. epidemiology, prevalence, incidence), costs ( e.g. cost analysis, economic burden, economic impact, economic evaluation ) and study type (systematic reviews, meta -analysis, randomized controlled tria ls, comparative studies, evaluation studies, observational studies, validation studies, multicenter studies, etc.). For the search terms subject headings (e. g. Medical Subject headings (MeSH) and free-text (e. g. truncation like adverse event* for advers e event or adverse events) were used. The search covered a period of ten years (2006 -2015) and was conducted in English. Abstracts and full texts of all EU languages were included in the selection process. The detailed search strategies are outlined in Annex 1. The following international databases were searched: Medline, Cochrane and EBSCOhost Research Databases and Scopus. Furthermore, reference lists of studies identified were used for reference tracking to ensure that all re levant literature on adverse events was captured. Additionally, a thorough hand search for the identification of grey literature on the issue of patient safety, unsafe care and adverse events was conducted including a search on the internet and on websites of the international organisations (e.g. European Union, WHO, OECD) . Screening and selection of the abstracts and full texts was bas ed on criteria defined ex ante by a minimum of two experts independently. The selection of the studies was subdivided into the first selection of publications and the second selection of full texts, both of which are described in the next section. Costs of unsafe care and cost -effectiveness of patient safety programmes February, 2016 25 First selection of relevant publications The first selection of publications was based on available abstracts and titles (if abstracts were not available) using eligible pre -defined criteria. The inclusion/exclusion followed formal criteria, contextual criteria, criteria concerning study design, medical criteria or oth er inclusion criteria (see Table 1). Table 1: First selection (abstracts) No. Selection aspects 1 Formal aspects (duplicates, publication date,...) 2 Geographical aspects (include EU, USA and Canada) 3 Primary focus is on unsafe care 4 One or more adverse events investigates 5 Epidemiologic or economic outcomes are analysed Source: G\u00d6 FP Second selection (full texts) For the second selection the criteria for the first selection were also applied and enhanced by quality and validity criteria and criteria for relevant endpoints. The full texts of all included abstracts were thoroughly read (in -depth review) and selected or eliminated . Quality assessment and grade of evidence The internal (risk of bias) and external validity (applicability of study results to patients outside the study population) of the selected studies was assessed after the second selection. The overall grading of the evidence was conducted in three steps: (1) evaluation of inte rnal validity (risk of bias), (2) evaluation of external validity and (3) evaluation of the overall grad of evidence synthesizing the internal and external validity. Evaluation of the internal validity (risk of bias) To evaluate the risk of bias, quality c riteria checklists were used [10]. These checklists depend on the study type (i.e. systematic literature reviews, meta -analysis, rando m- ised controlled trials, cohort studies, etc.) of the included literature. To interpret the levels of risk of bias, the following definitions are used. Table 2: Risk of bias - Definitions Low risk of bias It is unlikely that the outcome of the study is significantly distorted by confounding factors. The confidence in the correctness of the results is high. Moderate risk of bias It is unclea r to what extent the results of the study are distorted by confounding factors. Confounders are possible and could provide the correctness of the results into question. High risk of bias It is very likely that the result of the study is significantly dis torted by confounding factors. The confidence in the correctness of the results is very low. Unclear risk of bias The risk of bias cannot be evaluated because of missing information in the study. Source: Higgins/Green 2011 ; presentation: G\u00d6 FP Costs of unsafe care and cost -effectiveness of patient safety programmes February, 2016 26 Evaluation of external validity To evaluate the external validity of studies, the foll owing criteria are used ( Table 3) [11]. Table 3: Criteria for evaluation of external validity Relevant question Explanation Did the study refer to populations in primary care? Many studies are conducted in a highly specialised inpatient setting (such as university clinics) and the results are therefore not transferable to other settings such as primary care. Were the eligibility criteria not too stringent? The inclusion and ex clusion criteria for patients of clinical trials are often very stringent (age, co -morbidities etc.) and do not reflect the actual patient population. The transferability of the results to average patients is therefore low. Were endpoints assessed that a re relevant for the patient (health outcomes)? In clinical trials the primary endpoints are often surrogate endpoints from laboratory data that might not be relevant to the patient. Patient relevant endpoints are health outcomes that the patient can subjectively experience and feel (such as reduction o f symptoms). Were the study period and the modes of treatment clinically relevant (resembling conditions of daily living)? The study period and mode of treatment should resemble treatment situations in real life. This means that the mode and duration sho uld be flexible and according to patient\u00b4s behaviour in real life. Was the sample size sufficiently large to assess minimally important differences from a patient perspective? Statistical significance is usually ensured by a sufficiently large study popul ation; however, this does not mean that the population is large enough to assess relevant differences that can be experienced by the patient. The minimal clinically important difference should be taken into account when calculating the necessary size of th e study population.

Costs per occurrence of adverse events are typically expressed in monetary terms, in Quality Adjusted Life Years ( QALYs ) or lives lost, or in days of additional hospital LOS. Figures were extracted both from review and original research articles; the major ity of extracted figures are indirect citations from review articles. Prevalence of adverse events are typically reported in prevalence rates or rations such as \"per 1.000 patients/admissions/bed days\". As the literature gives no hints on how many p atients /admissions/bed days are recorded for the study population in total, a translation into one unit is not possible. Due to this non -comparability this study only took into account the most frequent representation of results, prevalence rates. Regarding econo mic methods, if at all, a wide range of different methods for attri b- uting and measuring costs were identified. Studies, which meet the eligibility criteria are described in the result section ( see chapter 5.3) and annex 2. The results of the different studies included are presented in annex 3 . 5.2.3 Calculation of economic burden of adverse events (Task 7) As was found in previous reviews, many published studies on the economic burden or cost of unsafe care describe no costing methodology or exact details on how figures have been derived [13-15]. 'Cost' is often not clearly defined, som e- times referring to direct resource consumption in health care, sometimes referring to broader concepts of 'c ost of illness'. Further, details on cost components, quantity, prices, time frames and similar are often missing, making it difficult for readers to assess quality of estimates as well as judge potential application to their settings [15]. Those studies that do elaborate on costing methodology , use a wide range in methods for attributing and measuring costs . Indeed, different methods for cost estimation are a major factor influencing the observed cost variation [15]. Choices in costing methodology often depend, for instance, on the Evidence Grade Definition High It is unlikely that further research changes the confidence in the observed results. Moderate Further research is likely to have an impact on the confidence in the observed results and the intervention effect might change. Low Further research is very likely to have a significant impact on the confidence in the observed results and the intervention effect might change. Very low The observed intervention effect is very uncertain. Costs of unsafe care and cost -effectiveness of patient safety programmes February, 2016 28 perspective or viewpoint of a study Estimated 'costs' can include resource use in the health sector, in other sectors, resources used by patients and their families as well as productivity changes (Drummond). Travel costs to the clinic are costs from a patient as well as from a society's point of view, but no when considering the viewpoint of a Ministry of Health or a public budget perspective. Similarly, if a study focuses on acute care it might be les s likely to include costs after hospital discharge such as societal costs of illness [14]. the chosen time horizon in which costs are tracked [14, 16] as well as the attribution of healthcare resources to the adverse event versus the patient's underlying condition [14]. Patients with longer length of stay and more co -morbidity are associated to higher cost for management of their underlying condition, but also more likely to exper i- ence and adverse event [14]. There are several methodological possibilities to attribute healthcare resources, for instance attributing resources to the unsafe care event versus underlying condi tion by a clinical expert, or comparing groups of p a- tients with and without the occurrence of adverse events [14]. In general cost information can be based either on gross or micro costing tech- niques . Gross costing is a top-down approach which allocates the total budget to specific services. Micro costing is a bottom -up approach which estimates various cost components precisely. The cost components taken into consideration can vary between studies which makes comparisons difficult [13]. Micro-costing, or quasi -micro (activity -based) costing, provides the highest level of accuracy as micro -costing attempts to measure actual resource consumption [15]. Gross -costing uses aggregated cost data to estimate typical costs. Such data is usually more readily available from electronic datasets, however provides less precise estimates [15]. In terms of hospital costing, for instance, levels of precision can range from (a) micro -costing to (b) case -mix group data, (c) disease - specific per diem to (d) average per diem data which is the least accurate [16]. Researchers thus face the usual trade -off between accuracy and effort and expense in data collection. Data required to cond uct micro -costing analysis is often unavailable or more difficult to obtain, meaning that micro -costing studies often focus on single hospitals or smaller samples rather than broader settings. In general, the cost estimation of adverse events is often bas ed on the average incremental length of stay. This is then multiplied by a cost estimate as just described, for instance a disease -specific per diem rate or average per diem information. While incremental length of stay is straightforward to use, it implie s excluding adverse events which do not prolong length of stay of those causing immediate death [13]. Costs of unsafe care and cost -effectiveness of patient safety programmes February, 2016 29 Deriving cost of unsafe care by adverse event group and EU Member country The choice of costing methodology applied in this report is heavily co n- strained by the availability of data or lack thereof . Since most costing info r- mation identified in the literature review is provided in the form of total cost of the adverse event or adverse event group, rat her than broken down in single cost components or incremental length of stay, this report is forced to use such total costing information. This means that costing methodologies might be mixed depending on available studies. Further, the limited number of s tudies providing costing estimates, particularly for some adverse event groups, as well as the non-transparent reporting on costing details , allows for no systematic selection or weighting based on quality of costing estimates . The report thus extracts all available 'cost of adverse event' estimates and uses relevant averages of such figures to estimate costs by adverse event group and EU Member country. Cost of adverse event data is only available for a few countries , most studies focusing on the US. The report uses OECD health -specific Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) estimates to approximate cost by EU Member State. Ideally , the report would use country -specific prevalence rates to adjust costing information . However, evidence on prevalence rates of adverse events is equally scarce, with again most of the few available studies stemming from the US or UK. Thus, this report will assume that prevalence rates are equal across EU Member States. Usually prevalence rates are provided as percentage s of hospital patients or patients and thus such figures will be adjusted using country -specific hospitalisation figures (hospital discharges) from the OECD. To summarize, the report aims to systematically extract cost per adverse event and prevalence rate from the available literature and subsequently calculate the economic burden of each adverse event category for each EU Member State along the following line: Figure 2: Calculation of Economic Burden of Adverse Event Group per EU Member State Source: G\u00d6 FP Firstly, extracted costs are normalized to the same year, the same currency and the European average price level using health -sector specific purchasing power parity information from Eurostat 2014 sector -specific PPP figures and, in the case of USA and Canada, data from the OECD 2011 PPP Benchmark [17] [18]. An average cost per case for each adverse event category is derived without being able to weight for Average Cost of Adverse Event adjusted to 2014 prices converted to Euros converted to EU average price level using EUROSTAT health -specific PPP figures. Prevalence Rate per hospital patient Country -specific hospitalisation figures OECD hospital discharges per 100,000 population multiplied by current population/100,0 00. Country - specific price - level adjus t- ment Adjustment using EUROSTAT health -specific PPP figures Costs of unsafe care and cost -effectiveness of patient safety programmes February, 2016 30 quality of costing information or other study details. Particular care is taken not to include the same estimation multiple times, since many publications cite the same primary studies further cost esti mates. These average costs are then multiplied by prevalence rates which depend on country -specific hospitalisation or doctor consult a- tion figures. Lastly, figures are adjusted to each country's price level by using Eur o- stat's health -sector specific purcha sing power parity figures. The aim is to calculate costs for each adverse event category and lastly summarize to total burden of adverse events. One limitation of such an additive approach is that certain adverse events might fall into multiple groups and thus potentially be included twice in the pre valence rates from the literature used. For instance, certain healthcare -associated infections might have also been included in acute -care adverse event studies In terms of sensitivity analysis, the report will compare overall costs derived thought this method with other studies calculating overall burden for certain countries . 5.3 Results 5.3.1 Find evidence on adverse events, their prevalence and costs (Task 3) The first literature search for both prevalence and costs yielded approximately 5 .000 results per search (9.900 total) , which is not workable in the scope of this project . The analysis of random samples of the results revealed the reason for the large number of studies: the search terms (such as safety or costs) are favoured key terms in titles and abstracts, most of the identified studies did not give any information on prev a- lence or costs of adverse events/unsafe care. To reduce the number of results only reviews were included in the systematic literature search . To ensure that the identified reviews cover the whole scope of literature, reference lists of the identified studies were analysed. The analysis of included reviews showed two results which lead to the assumption that the chosen strategy is justified. Fi rst, all reviews refer to the same pool of primary studies. Second, the reviews cover a wide time frame with very recent studies . Studies that were published after the time horizon of the latest review were additionally covered by a hand search. An additio nal hand search was conducted on selected websites and institutions as well as for adverse event groups with little information from the systematic search. The s ystematic literature search on prevalence of adverse events was conducted in Medline via OVID, Cochrane via OVID, Embase via OVID, CINAHL via EBSCO and Scopus on 22nd April 2015 (see annex 1 for search strategies). In total , 893 abstracts were delivered (duplicates were excluded). After the selection of relevant a bstracts according to predefined selection criteria 183 full texts were ordered, of which all were available. The addi tional hand search of grey literature adds 16 relevant publications . For a detailed representation of search results see annex 2. The syst ematic literature search on the costs of adverse events was conducted in Medline via OVID, Cochrane via OVID, Embase via OVID, CINAHL via EBSCO and Scopus on 2 0th April 2015 (see annex 1 for search strategies). In total, 616 abstracts were delivered (duplicates were excluded). After the selection of relevant abstracts according to predefined selection criteria 160 full texts were ordered, of which all were available. The additional hand search of grey literature adds 24 relevant publications . Publications were excluded if no such figure could be extracted. In total, figures were extracted from 45 publications. For a detailed representation of search results see annex 2. Costs of unsafe care and cost -effectiveness of patient safety programmes February, 2016 31 Some publications report figures that are applicable to s pecific groups of patients, e.g. patients in paediatric ICUs or patients undergoing a specific type of treatment, e.g. transplantations. These figures were extracted from the publications but not used in subsequent calculations of total costs, as it is unl ikely that these figures are repr e- sentative for adverse events in general. 5.3.2 Analyse evidence on prevalence of adverse events (Task 4) Prevalence Although a large number of epidemiological studies could be identified by systematic and hand search, only a few could be incorporated in this study. Table 14 in annex 3 shows the results of the data extraction from studies with comparable designs and results. It lists ranges and figures for seven adverse event groups and adverse events in general. The table also includes rates of preventability and the region a study was conducted. Final results will be presented in chapter 5.3.4 . This project and its research questions face four major issues related to publishe d studies: comparability of results, insufficient information on several EU member - states, wide ranges of results in -between studies and countries and level of aggreg a- tion of adverse event groups. Comparability of study design and results As this study se eks to calculate the overall economic burden for adverse events it is important to derive the burden of all different types and groups of adverse events. Authors of published studies don't have the need of this kind of aggregation and the way the epidemiology of adverse events is reported differs strongly, according to available data while conducting a study or the adverse event group itself. Therefore the reported epidemiology in identified stud ies varies from prevalence, incidence, cases per 100/1.000 admissions/bed days/patients etc. Due to a lack of information (e.g. how many admissions are recorded for a certain hospital or health care system) it is not possible to standardise these data. No sufficient information on EU member -states Identified studies don't give sufficient information on prevalence in different EU countries or member -states. Only single results for certain countries and adverse events are reported. Level of geographical aggr egation is EU -wide, world -wide, USA, Africa, high - middle - and low -income countries or \"international\". Therefore the assumption has been made that adverse events have the same prevalence across Europe. Wide ranges of results in -between studies and countri es All studies (also from European countries with only a small number of participating institutions) report wide ranges in their results (e.g. prevalence rates from 0.1 -74%). This hinders a comparison of studies considerably and shows that adverse events rates vary in countries and health systems. Level of aggregation of adverse event groups This study aims to give an overall picture on adverse events by aggregating adverse events into subgroups. Studies on adverse events focus in most of the cases on Costs of unsafe care and cost -effectiveness of patient safety programmes February, 2016 32 specific events which can be classified in different subgroups (e.g. an infection during surgery is in primary studies classified as surgical error or health care associated infection). Classification of subgroups was done in accordance with the expert panel. 5.3.3 Analyse evidence on costs of adverse events (Task 4) The following chapter analyses the evidence on costs of adverse events. Detailed tables for these results are listed in annex 3. Generic adverse events 11 publications address adverse events generally. They report average or regional total (e.g. national) costs of adverse events. Some publications focus on Canada (2), USA (2) or the UK (2); the others inclu de data from several countries. Table 15 in annex 3 summarizes all data on costs of generic adverse events extracted from publications. Total impact of adverse events Annually, adverse events cause 44.000 to 98.000 deaths in the US [19] and 9,250 to 23,750 deaths in Canada [20]. We found no such total number for other countries. Worldwide, 23 million DALY are lost due to adverse events, of which 78.6% is due to premature death [21]. But also the financial impact of adverse events is substantial. In general terms, adverse events are reported to be responsible for 1% (Netherlands, preventable AE only) [22] to 4-6% (USA) [19] of all healthcare expenditures. In the UK, the costs of preventable adverse effects in terms of extra bed days alone was calculated to be a billion pounds per year [22], or in total two billion pounds per year [23]. In Canada, increased length of stay of adverse events alone causes extra costs of approximately CAD 400m [24]. In the USA, adverse events result in 2.4m extra hospital days, costing a total of USD 9.3m [25] to 37.6b [26]. Costs of episodes of adverse events Some publications also give costs per episode of generic adverse events. Etchells [24] list references for costs per episode of adverse event between CAD 6,124 and CAD 12,648, with a typical increased LOS of 6 days. Mittmann [27] reports costs per episode of adverse event of USD 4,571 or USD 10,074. Acute care adverse events 5 publications address acute care adverse events. However, only one publication quotes p er case costs of \"generic\" acute care events - about 13 thousand dollars per case [28]. Rivard [29] reports costs per case, excess LOS and excess mortality for a series of postoperative conditions (see Table 16, annex 3 ). Other publications report costs of specific adverse events, such as USD 55,654 per case in US transplant patients [28], AUD 5, 751 per case in cardiac surgery (Austrialia) [30] or fourfold increase of in an US paediatric ICUs (17.5 days vs. 7.6 days) following failed extubation [31]. Occurrence of venous thromboembolism, a typical adverse Costs of unsafe care and cost -effectiveness of patient safety programmes February, 2016 33 event caused by surgery -related bed rest, was found to be responsible for loss of 2,282 DALYs in high -income countries in 2009 [32]. The diverse nature of adverse events relat ed to acute care impede comparability of figures. Published figures for cardiac surgery, transplant or PICU adverse events are unlikely to be representative for all acute care adverse events; publication bias would distort results if we were to extrapolate costs of acute care adverse events from these figures Table 16 summarizes all extracted data. Adverse drug events Since this study focuses on the consequences of unsafe care with the aim of guiding patient safety improvement priorities for healthcare org anisations , publications that discuss known side effects of drugs that may very well occur in absence of any error were thus excluded. 7 publications m eet these criteria. They are summarized in Table 17 in annex 3. Total impact of adverse drug events Adverse drug events lead to death or injury of 770k people per year in the USA [33]. 779 thousand DALYs were lost in high income countries due to ADE in 2009 [21]. In economic terms, total costs of inappropriate medic ation in the USA are reported to be 7.2 billion dollar [26, 33], 1.5 to 5.5 billion [33], and 2 billion (extra hospital costs) or 100 billion (total burden of disease) [34]. In Can ada, total costs of ADE in patients 65 years or older are USD 35.7 million [34]. Costs per adverse drug event Publications report costs of an ADE per case at USD 2,000 [26]; EUR 793-2380; EUR 5,505; EUR 1,329; [35]; 4,028 for all ADE, and 1,983 for preventable ADE; EUR 321 or 824 in two different calculation methods employed in Ireland, EUR 2,507 pe r episode, in Nethe r- lands; EUR 4,844 in Spain [34]. Chiatti [34] also list costs of ADE attributable to some specific medications, such as aspirine, which causes additional costs of GB P 50 per episode of ADE or inappropriate use of proton pump inhibitors, which causes US -wide total costs of USD 233,944 (over -the-counter) plus 1,566,252 (prescribed) in USA. The use of NSAID causes extra costs of USD 117 in 1998 per application due to adv erse events. Falls 4 publications address the costs of falls. In USA, falls cause 581 thousand hospitaliz a- tions and 19 .7 thousand deaths in 2008. They are responsible for costs of USD 19.2 or 28.2 billion, i.e. 0.85% to 1.5% of total health expenditures. A hip fracture costs AUD 11,991 [36] or more than USD 20 thousand [37]. The WHO [26] reports falls lead to a 61% increase in LOS, and 71% increase in inpatien t costs. They are responsible for a loss of 27 thousand DALYs in high income countries [21]. Table 18 in annex 3 lists all extracted cost figures. Costs of unsafe care and cost -effectiveness of patient safety programmes February, 2016 34 Unsafe blood products Unsafe blood products are primarily a problem for low income countries. Two p ublica- tions, listed in Table 19, annex 3, address this issue. Worldwide, unsafe injections cause 1.3M early deaths, loss of 26M life years and USD 535M direct medical costs [26]. Unsafe injections alone are est imated to cost the world USD 535M in direct medical costs per year [26]. Relevance of t hat information to European countries is however questionable. Diagnostic errors Only one publication , listed in Table 20, annex 3 , deals with diagnostic errors specif i- cally. Diagnostic errors account for 40 ,000 - 80,000 deaths in US hospitals per year. As a specific example, suboptimal radiology processes were identified as a contribution to medical errors escalating economic costs, which are est imated at more than USD 38 thousand per year [38]. Healthcare -associated infections With 24 publications , healthcare -associated infections are the most prominent group of adverse events among our literature search results. These publications are summ a- rized in Table 21, annex 3. Generic healthcare -associated infections : In general, healthcare -associated infections kill 5,000 people per year in France and the UK [26] and about 100 thousand people per year in the United States. They cause costs of about USD 800 million to several billion in each USA and Europe. Stratifications : Publications stratify costs of HAI by pathogen, by type/location of infection, and setting. C. difficile and multi -resistant S. aureus are the most highlighted pathogens: Types of infections most frequently covered in the literature include ventilator -associated pneumonia (VAP) , central -line associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) , surgical site infections (SSI) and urinary tract infections (UTI) . Other publications report costs of infections i n the ICU or the paediatric ICU: In general, most publications report cost figures of about USD 1,000 to 20,000 per case of HAI. In special sett ings or populations, costs can be much higher. Decubitus ulcers 5 publications , summarized in Table 22 (annex 3) , address the cost of decubitus ulcers. The total trea tment cost of decubitus ulcers in the UK amounts to GBP 1.4 to 2.1 billion or 4% of health expenditures [26]. In the USA, 60 thousand patients die from decubitus ulcers per year [39]. In all high -income countries, decubitus ulcers ar e responsible for the loss of 134 thousand DALYs [21]. A single occurrence of decubitus ulcer causes excess mortality of 7.2%, excess co sts of USD 10,845 and increased LOS of 4 days [29]. Jackson [36] reports costs per case of AUD 8,435. Adverse events related to medical devices Publications addressing device -related adverse events are very rare. Only one publication [36] reports costs of one type of adverse ev ents related to medical devices Costs of unsafe care and cost -effectiveness of patient safety programmes February, 2016 35 (Table 23, annex 3). C osts complications of cardiac and vascular implants excluding septicaemia at AUD 7,749 per case. Albeit these complications are comparatively common with 2,873 cases in the dat a- base of 1,699,997 hospitalizations in two Australian provinces, it is questionable to what degree this type of adverse event can be regarded as representative for adverse events related to medical devices. Discussion Variation A striking feature of cost fig ures for adverse events is the substantial variation among publi shed figures . Even for a specific type of adverse event, cost figures may vary by a factor of up to 1:10. If figures of different types of adverse event of the same category (e.g. healthcare -associated infections) are compared, or specific settings ore populations are considered (e.g. paediatric ICU) the spread is even larger. The leading cause s of variation are Small sample sizes of the studies . If the sample size of a study that reports costs of adverse events is small, high variation of costs due to patient heterogene i- ty is to be expected. [13] Difficulties of allocating inpatient costs . A number of problems impede the attributability of costs to adverse events. Running costs of departments may be difficult to attribute to single patients with adverse events. Internal service char g- es, on which cost estimates obtained via activity -based c osting could be based, may vary across providers. Also, it may prove difficult to uniquely identify the a d- verse event as single root cause for a given on -patient activity. Differences in the time frames used. The economic perspective employed , i.e. payer s' perspective, hospital costs, societal perspective, etc. [16] The cost categories included . [40, 41] Organizational -level variation in coding practices . [42] Different costs of medical services in different countries . [43] The costing method employed and the cost categories included (see chapter 5.2.3). Unfortunately, many publications do not report the underlying costing methodology [40]. Payer Theoretical concepts of costs of adverse events comprise monetary costs to hospitals providers, health insurance, patients, as well as non -monetary tangible and intangible costs of illness which accrue to patients and/or their relatives [16]. Only one publication lists societal costs of healthcare -associated infections [44]. Other publications refer to the (incremental) cost o f treating the adverse effect or to cost figures established by malpractice litigation. Theoretically, if hospitals shoulder the burden of additional costs due to adverse events, they should have an extra financial incentive to invest in patient safety programmes that reduce these avoidable costs. However, even if we limit our analysis to financial costs, it is not obvious who bears them: Costs of unsafe care and cost -effectiveness of patient safety programmes February, 2016 36 \"Besides harming patients, adverse events have major financial consequences. But who bears the extra costs for treating adverse events is not well understood.\" [45] In the United States, adverse events lead to increased hospital charges via increased LOS [45]. In an analysis of adverse events in Utah and Colorado, Mello [46] find that in 1992 hospitals bear only 22% of the societal costs caused by adverse events. On average, health care costs account for only about half the costs of the adverse event. Of these costs, hospitals can externalize a substantial ratio to patients or healt h insurance. Only a fraction of total costs of injuries are internalized via litigation claims. Reforms of the tort system may be the key to better internalization of the cost of adverse events [47]; however the effects of malpractice laws on medical practice is not unequivocally beneficial. Fear of litigation might cause healthcare providers to minimize litigation risk instead of choosing the optimal treatment for patients. This defensi ve medicine may cause additional costs and/or harm to patients [48]. 5.3.4 Finalization of adverse events selection and refinement of information on prevalence and costs (Task 6) The finalization of prevalence of adverse events is the result of extracted literature and in terviews from the expert panel. As mentioned above the experts showed detailed information of specific events (e.g. in this case urinary tract infections) but had very limited information (in addition to the extracted literature) on adverse event groups (e.g. in this case health care associ ated infections). Table 6 shows the combination of extracted li terature and expert estimations per adverse event group. Preventability of events is illustrated by degree of preventability with \"easy, medium or hard\". Note that in contrast to the original grouping of events (see chapter 2) \"Decubitus Ulcers\" was incorporated into \"Acute Care\" due to expert recommendation. As described in chapter 5.3.3, variation in cost figures and different types of adverse events within each adverse event groups hinder quantification of costs of adverse events at the level of adverse event gr oups. Table 7 compares lowest and highest estimates of costs per episode of an adverse event for three adverse event groups, all values are converted to 2014 Euro. As can be seen in Table 16, the lowest estimate within the acute care AE group, accidental puncture, is estimated to cost only a fraction of a typical adverse event in transplants patients' acute care. Likewise, costs of healthcare -associated infections vary substantially. An episode of nosocomial urinary tract infections may be 56 times less costly than nosocomial sepsis. The spread of 1:19 in adverse drug events may be related to the fact that different types of adverse events are included in the cost figures. Therefore no reliable statements on costs of adverse events and event groups can be made. Costs of unsafe care and cost -effectiveness of patient safety programmes February, 2016 37 Table 6: Final list of adverse event groups Adverse Event Group Prevalence Share Preventable acute care adverse events/ adverse events due to surgical errors 0.3-15% of patients are affected 38% Medium/Hard healthcare associated infections 3.5-14.8% of patients in hospitals have infections 25% Medium/Hard adverse drug events/medication error 0.4-28.3% of patients experience ADE 15% Medium/Hard errors in diagnosis 1.4% -5.8% - rate of misdiagnosis) 10% Medium/Hard others - 5% - adverse events due to falls 0.3-2% of patients in hospitals suffer from falls 3% Medium medical devices adverse events - 2% Easy/Medium adverse events due to unsafe blood products & biological products 0.37% of apheresis collections FP Table 7: Costs of adverse events by adverse event group Adverse event group lowest cost estimate highest cost estimate spread acute care adverse events / adverse events due to surgical errors EUR 3.016 EUR 43.414 1:14 healthcare -associated infections EUR 645 EUR 36.141 1:56 adverse drug events / medication errors EUR 294 EUR 5.689 1:19 Source: G\u00d6 FP 5.3.5 Calculation of economic burden of adverse events (Task 7) As outlined in Section 5.2.3, this report aims to use the extracted costing and prev a- lence information to derive average prevalence and cost per case figures per identified adverse event category and calculate overall ec onomic burden of adverse events by EU Member country. Figure 3: Calculating Economic Burden per Adverse Event Category and Member State Source: G\u00d6 FP As was outlined in Section 5.2.1, estimated prevalence rates vary vastly, however a general bandwidth per adverse event category could be derived. The issue here, as described, is that categories are likely to overlap and thus overall prevalence rates when aggregating adverse event categories might be overestimated . For instance , certain infections might be counted both among acute care events as well as healthcare -associated infections. Average Cost of Adverse Event Prevalence Rate per hospital patient Country - specific hospitalis a- tion f igures Country - specific price -level adjustment Costs of unsafe care and cost -effectiveness of patient safety programmes February, 2016 38 In terms of costs of adverse events, aggregating the available costing information to category level is similarly problematic. The available st udies generally do not cost adverse event groups, or comparable adverse event groups, but calculate costs for specific adverse events or settings. For instance, within the acute care adverse event category, one of the very few available studies estimates c osts for transplant patients, surely a rather small subgroup and not necessarily representative in terms of costs for the overall category . Deriving costs per case for each adverse event category by simply averaging over available studies thus may yield a substantial publication bias. In terms of healthcare -associated infections, the category with most available costing evidence, the most researched infections appear to be central -line associated bloodstream infection, catheter -associated urinary tract inf ections or non -Methicillin -resistant Staphylococcus. Without information on what fraction of overall healthcare -associated infections are such types of cases, all types of infections are weighted equally. If infections that are more costly are more likely to be studied and more likely have available costing evidence, then such publication bias will lead to larger average cost per case figures. Due to data quality and availability problems, but also largely due to such aggregation and publication bias issue s, the approach outlined in Section 5.2.3 and above in 5.3.3 prove s to be problematic . Since the outlined approach cannot be used to yield reliable values, this report has to rely on previous estimates of overall costs to provide a sensible suggestion of magnitude of the burden of adverse events. Cost estimated for overall adverse events are available for a small selection of countries.1 In the US, Kohn reports that total costs associated with adverse events represent USD 37.6 to 50 billion, or about 4 -6 percent of health expenditure. On the other hand, Vlayen 2014 [25] estimates an annual burden of USD 9.3 million, which [19] is 0.3% of total health expenditure. For the UK, Milna 2007 [23] cites an overall burden of GBP 2 Billion, which equals around 1.5% of total nation al health expenditure2. For Canada, Milna 2007 cites estimates between CAD 300 million and CAD 1.5 billion, i.e. 0.2% to 0.8% of total health expenditure. 1 Costing studies cited here refer to studies that aim to cost the entire adverse event burden, not merely the preventable or avoidable share of adverse events. 2 After the literature search was conducted, a new study [49] was published with relevant data for this report in December 2015. Due to organizational and methodological reasons this study was not incorporated in this report. The results from the study support the findings in this report. Costs of unsafe care and cost -effectiveness of patient safety programmes February, 2016 39 Table 8: Overall Economic Burden of Adverse Events according to Literature Country Source Costs of adverse events Costs as % of total health expend i- ture 2014 USA Kohn 2000 4-6% of health expenditure 4.0-6.0% Vlayen 2011 USD 9.3 billion 0.3% UK Milna 2007 GBP 2 billion 1.5% Canada Milna 2007 CAD million - 1.5 billion 0.2-0.8% Source: Calculation G\u00d6 FP; OECD Database Annual consumer price inflation; Eurostat Database GDP at current market prices and annual exchange rate 2014; World Bank Database total health expenditure as percentage of GDP Thus, according to the scar cely available literature, estimates of the overall burden of adverse events range from about 0.2 % to 6.0% of total health expenditure , confirming that the results of the previously outlined approach highly overestimate economic burden. The range suggested by the literature would imply an economic burden of adverse events within the European Union of between EUR 2.8 and EUR 84.6 billion of direct costs for the public health care sector (this value would be even higher if also indirect cost would be incorpor ated) . The only European reference figure suggests a burden around 1.5% of health expenditure (HE) (which is confirmed by a recent publication from the Netherlands [49]).

Romania 480.6 Slovakia Slovenia 6.8 51.3 G\u00d6 FP; World Bank Database Total Health Expenditure as % of GDP; Eurostat Database GDP at current market prices 5.3.6 Conclusions and discussion of financial impact of unsafe care The literature on unsafe care clearly shows that the burden resulting from adverse events is not negligible. Results of the literature review show a general prevalence of adverse events in 4 -17 percent of all patients [32, 50-53]. Even when using the bottom -range of estimates direct costs for the public health care sector appear to be a minimum of EUR 2.8 b illion, or 0.2 percent of HE . The upper -range direct costs appear to be a maximum of 84 .6 billion or 6 percent and the results f rom a European refe r- ence 21.2 billion or 1.5 percent of HE . As no indirect costs are incorporated in this Costs of unsafe care and cost -effectiveness of patient safety programmes February, 2016 41 estimate, the overall economic burden (direct and indirect costs) is higher than the results of this report. Indirect costs are not incorporated in th is report due to the following reasons: It is difficult to quantify intangible costs associated with unsafe care. Assigning a price tag to deaths following adverse events in Europe is even more difficult. Firstly, no reviewed publication reported a number of deaths due to adverse events, all available figures refer to Northern America. Economists refer to the concept of statistical value of life when the trade -off between monetary wealth and fatal risks are analysed. These concepts are widespread in traffic accident prevention and industrial safety, where values of lives saved need to be determined in order to justify levels of investments in safety. Economists estimate the statistical value of life using the behavioural concepts of revealed preferences - e.g. wage premiums in high -risk professions - or stated preferences - e.g. willingness to pay as determined via contingent valuation questionnaires. Application of statistical values of life is less widespread in health policy, where cost - effectiveness analy sis or cost-utility analysis prevails [54]. These methods do not assign a monetary value to a person's life. Estimation of statistical value of saved lives through investment in patient safety face the additional challenge that patients whose lives can be saved via patient safety investments are - in contrast to potential traffic accidents - of old age and have impaired health. Here it should be noted that, strictly speaking, patient safety inves t- ments do not save lives but rather delay death; and the older and sicker a patient is, the less death can be delayed by patient safety investments. In contrast to that, findings from stated preferences studies suggest that the willingness to pay does not as anticipated decrease with o lder and/or sicker respondents [55]. Furthermore, es timates of statistical value of life feature substantial variance. Mrozek and Taylor [56] report that \"estimates of the VSL vary sub stantially, from less than $100,000 to more than $25 million \". However, most figures for high -income countries range between $ 7 and $ 10 million. Identified epidemiological studies have only limited value for answering the research questions of this study. Literature primary focuses on very specific events (e.g. urinary tract infection) and gives insufficient information on adverse event groups defined in this studies context (e.g. health care associated infections). Besides that, studies with adequate information show wide ranges in results for identical adverse events within countries, regions and cities and lack of a differentiation across EU member states. Data availability on cost of adverse events is strongly dissatisfactory and allows few further statements on the exact level of costs, variation of cost and prevalence rates between different member states and on the factors leading to higher or lower economic burden. Few figures on costs are available, even fewer outside the US, UK or Canadian context. Further, the small number of exitin g studies shows a large variation in estimates, due to small sample sizes, different methodologies, cost categories included and definition of time horizon. Many of the available studies appear to be of low quality, with low transparency on exact methodolo gy and data sources applied and with few standards allowing the comparison of studies across settings and types of adverse events. Costs of unsafe care and cost -effectiveness of patient safety programmes February, 2016 42 In conclusion, this extensive review of the literature finds that further primary studies of epidemiology and costs of adverse events are needed, to gain a better grasp of the exact size of economic burden and factors influencing its magnitude. Costs of unsafe care and cost -effectiveness of patient safety programmes February, 2016 43 6 Cost-effective patient safety programmes 6.1 Aim The aim of this chapter is to identify and select cost -effective patient safety pr o- grammes in the EU/EEA Member States. For the selected programmes success factors and potential weaknesses will be identified and cost -effectiveness and efficiency indicators developed. The followi ng research questions will be addressed : What cost -effective patient safety programmes related to a selected set of adverse events are implemented according to the literature? What success factors and potential weaknesses of the selected programmes can be identified? What are indicators for cost -effectiveness and efficiency of patient safety pr o- grammes? 6.2 Methodology 6.2.1 Selection of cost -effective patient safety programmes (Task 8) The systematic literature search on patient safety programmes was conducted by linking different search terms regarding Patient safety programmes (e.g. patient safety program/project, safety manag e- ment program/project, risk management program/project) Cost-effectiveness (e.g. cost, cost analysis, cost -benefit -analysis, program evaluation, evaluation study, etc.). For the search terms subject headings (e. g. Medical Subject headings (MeSH) and free-text (e. g. truncation like program* for programs or programme or programmes) were used. The search covered a period of ten years (20 06-2015) and was conducted in English. Abstracts and full texts of all EU languages were included in the selection process. The detailed search strategies are outlined in Annex 1. The following international databases were searched: Medline, Cochrane and E via EBSCOhost Research Databases and Scopus. For further details on the literature search, data extraction, quality assessment and risk of bias as well as data extraction and analysis see chapter 5.2. 6.3 Results 6.3.1 Selection of cost -effective patient safety programmes (Task 8) The systematic literature search on patient safety programmes was conducted in Medline via OVID, Cochrane via OVID, Embase via OVID, CINAHL via EBSCO and Scopus on 23rd June 2015 (see annex 1 for search strategies). In total, 339 abstracts were delivered (duplicates were excluded). After the selection of relevant ab stracts according to predefined selection criteria 69 full texts were ordered, of which 69 were available. Costs of unsafe care and cost -effectiveness of patient safety programmes February, 2016 44 The additional hand search of grey literature adds 8 relevant publication. After the selection of the full texts, 20 publications were identified to be relevant. 6 publications were included for back ground and context information. For a detailed representation of search results see annex 4. 6.3.2 Identification of strengths and weaknesses of selected cost -effective patient safety programmes (Task 9) A total of 49 abstracts and programmes were collected and analysed according to their contents . Descriptions (e.g. addresses, setting, prevalence, cost data, aim, effectiv e- ness, etc.) were collected and transferred to an examination file. In a further step, the programmes were classified into 3 categories. The extracted abstracts had to fulfil sufficient criteria, such as exact description of the programme objectives, planned interventions, outcome description , report of the programme costs and impact on further cost reductions due to the intervention to be selected as a matching pr o- gramme. The evaluation of the programmes resulted in following findings (Table 10). Eleven out of 49 programmes met all the mentioned criteria, included cost data and were identified as efficient programm es [41, 57-66]. Twelve out of 46 programmes did not met all mentioned criteria due to the lack of cost data, but were identified as efficient programmes [23, 67-77] as these programmes include precious information and costs can be estimated if necessary . Studies with Authors, title and year of publication are listed in Annex 4. Table 10: Selected / excluded abstracts or programmes selected / excluded abstracts or programmes quantity efficient programme - cost data available 11 efficient programme - no cost data 12 study, systematic review, insufficient outcome or other reasons for exclusion 26 total 49 Source: G\u00d6 FP The aim of this task was to identify and select cost -effective patient safety pr o- grammes in the EU/EEA Member Stat es. Efficient programmes with available cost data are primary based on Amer ican (7) or Canadian (1) and three European studies (3) . Reasons for exclusion of studies varied, e.g. the reports contained no cost data and/or insufficient results were presented in t he study or reports had methodological wea k- nesses . Attention is invited to the fact that no studies report weaknesses of pr o- grammes or cost -inefficient programmes (only one study report s cost-neutral results). This might be a hint on a publication bias. Sources of efficient programmes containing no cost data derive from different countries. A detailed overview is given in the following table .

The selecte d programmes focus on three different adverse event groups and types and represent a major burden of adverse events described in chapter 6. The studies focus on labour efforts to prevent pressure ulcers, a theory based approach to implement clinical guidel ines and the introduction of electronic medication ordering systems [64-66]. As a fourth example of a cost -effective patient safety programme a Canadian study which deals with HAI is introduced, as it describes a best practice example and served as prototype for the applied simulation model [78]. For background information and incorporation in the recommendations two mor e programmes were included, although the studies are US based, as the information given can be transferred to the European setting [41, 58]. M\u00f8lbak et al. Are labour -intensive efforts to prevent pressure ulcers cost - effective? The Danish Society for Patient Safety introduced the Pressure Ulcer Bundle in order to reduce hospital -acquired pressure ulcers in 2010. The objective of this study [64] was to investigate the cost -effectiveness of labour -intensive efforts to reduce pressure ulcers in the Danish Health Care Sector, comparing the Pressure Ulcer Bundle with standard care. The results of the study show that prevention of hospital -acquired p ressure ulcers by implementing labour -intensive effects according to the Pressure Ulcer Bundle was cost-saving and resulted in an improved effect compared to standard care. The incremental cost of the bundle was minus EUR 38.62. The incremental effects wer e a reduction of 9.3 % prevented pressure ulcers and 0.47 % prevented deaths. The analysis confirmed the incremental cost -effectiveness ratio's dominance for both prevented pressure ulcers and saved lives with the Pressure Ulcer Bundle. The main measures of the Pressure Ulcer Bundle are: The Danish Society for Patient Safety developed the Pressure Ulcer Bundle to reduce the prevalence of pressure ulcers in Danish hospitals. The bundle was tes t- ed at five Danish hospitals from 2010 to 2013. The bundle consi sts of guidelines on how to optimize and secure the use of already existing tools and on structuring the preventive initiatives. The four major elements of the bundle are: (1) all newly hospitalized patients are assessed for the risk of developing pressure ulcers, (2) patients at risk of develo p- ing pressure ulcers are reassessed daily, (3) patients at risk should be nutrition Costs of unsafe care and cost -effectiveness of patient safety programmes February, 2016 46 screened and (4) patients at risk should be mobilized optimally and decompression should be used when repositioning in accordance wit h guidelines. The four elements were adjusted and implemented in the daily routine using the Model for Improvement which aims to continuously improve and reflect on the methods used by the involved hospital staff. Taylor et al. The clinical and cost effect iveness of a theory based approach to the implementation of a national guideline The authors of this study tested a theory based approach in three NHS hospitals in the UK in 2011 to improve th e implementation of guidelines [65]. The study adopted the Theoretical Domains Framework Impleme ntation (TDFI) approach for supporting behaviour change required for the uptake of a national patient safety guideline to reduce the risk of feeding through misplaced nasogastric tubes. The target behaviour identified for change was to increase the use of pH testing as the first line method for checking the position of a nasogastric tube. The results show that the TDFI approach improved the uptake of a patient safety guideline across three hospitals and is clinically and cost -effective in comparison to the usual practice. The estimated savings and costs in the first year were GBP 2.56 million and \u00a3GBP 1.41 respectively, giving an ROI of 82 %, and this was projected to increase to 270 % over five years. The main measures of the TDFI approach are: A behaviour change methodology for implementation is called \"Theoretical D o- mains Framework\" and it aids the identification of barriers and levers to organis a- tional and individual behaviour change. The \"Theoretical Domains Framework\" was adapted for the im plementation of clinical guidelines This TDFI approach draws on evidence based implementation principles. The TDFI approach is based on a six step procedure for behaviour change: (1) forming an implementation team, (2) defining a locally relevant target be haviour, (3) understanding barriers to performing the target behaviour, (4) devising inte r- vention strategies to address identified barriers, (5) intervention implementation and (6) evaluation. As a bottom -up strategy, the TDFI approach aims to facilitate a collaborative team with a blend of front -line healthcare professional expertise and theoretical support to co-work through an implementation process. Vermeulen et al. Cost-effectiveness of an electronic medication ordering system in hospitalized patients This study [66] was conducted in two Dutch hospitals between 2005 and 2008. The aim was to study the balance between the effects and costs of an elec tronic medic a- tion ordering system (CPOE/CDSS) compared to the traditional paper -based medic a- tion ordering. The results show costs of EUR 12.37 for paper -based ordering and EUR 14.91 for CPOE/CDSS per patient/day. The amount that has to be invested i n order to prevent an error is EUR 3.54 for medication errors and EUR 322.70 for preventable medication errors. Electronic medication ordering systems contribute to a decreased risk of preventable harm and the extra costs of CPOE/CDSS are acceptable. The main me asures of electronic medication ordering systems are: The traditional medication prescribing system is paper -based and relies on hand - written prescriptions by various healthcare professionals. Costs of unsafe care and cost -effectiveness of patient safety programmes February, 2016 47 Computerized physician order entry (CPOE) systems and CPOE with a Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) are considered to be a useful alternative to e n- hance patient safety Recent studies report a significant impact (decrease) of CPOE on medication errors. Raschka et al. Health economic evaluation of an infection pre vention and control (IPC) programme The Vancouver Coastal Health is a regional Health Authority in British Columbia that spent more than CAD 66.3 million managing 24, 937 health care -acquired infections (HAI) cases over the 4 -year evaluation period [62]. Urinary tract infections, methici l- lin-resist ant Staphylococcus aureus, and B acteremias caused the main costs. During the four year t ime period a reduction of 4, 739 HAI cases avoided costs of CAD 9.1 million while the infection prevention and c ontrol programme generated investments of CAD 6.7 million. The investment costs were CAD 2.4 million below the expected costs if no intervention would have been done. Over a time period of two years several basic points were developed to control and avoid adverse events: establishing consistent infection prevention policies and procedures developing focused int erventions (e.g., reduction of B acteremias, control of methicillin -resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA], a hand hygiene program, Clostridium diffic ile [CDI] isolation and treatment guidelines, catheter -associated urinary tract infection [UTI] prevention initiatives) in collaboration with the IPC team, medical microbiologists and senior administration the IPC programme was fully integrated into a qual ity and patient safety pr o- gramme along with a number of other key programmes (e.g. accreditation, quality improvement and change management, performance monitoring, and human fa c- tors engineering) For five years all laboratory tests were processed centrally , facilitating data collection and integration of surveillance initiatives. Concluding remarks on patient safety programmes The identified examples show that a promising programme is based on a multi -method approach. Efficient programmes can be developed by the organisation itself or existing programmes can be adapted for the implementation. Employees of all professions have to be involved in relating processes. Working programmes include the training of different occupational groups and professions for pa tient safety -related measures. The aim of professional trainings is to increase the awareness of their employees for patient safety. In a next step, emplo y- ees will be entrusted with responsibility to avoid errors in the future. Human resources department e nsure to provide resources for the agreed duties and responsibilities to fulfil the patient safety -related measures. In addition, processes and instructions for actions are defined. Basic points of successful programmes: Defining objectives , Defining responsibilities , Creating structures , Optimizing processes , Monitoring and analysing results , Setting additional or adjusted interventions if necessary. Costs of unsafe care and cost -effectiveness of patient safety programmes February, 2016 48 Hospital owners or the management of hospitals have to assume responsibilities to lead the project or programme to success. As structural and financial decisions have to be taken, the commitment of authorities is essential. The mentioned elements should all be embedded in a working quality and/or risk management. The quality manag e- ment should take the role to coordinate and monitor all essential activities. The lack of one or more basic points will presumably affect the succes s of patient safety programmes. Costs of unsafe care and cost -effectiveness of patient safety programmes February, 2016 49 7 Assessment of cost -effectiveness of patient safety programmes 7.1 Aim The aim of the following three task s is to assess the cost -effectiveness and efficiency of investment in patient safety programmes and develop policy recommendations on prioritisation of patient safety strategies. Further, lessons will be drawn from the conducted analysis and areas of furth er research will be proposed and recommend a- tions on methodologies and frameworks for economic analysis of patient safety programmes given. The following research questions will be addressed : What is the economic case for investing in patient safety? Which patient safety programmes are the most cost -effective? What recommendations can be given in terms of prioritization of different patient safety strategies? How should further evaluations of patient safety programmes be conducted? 7.2 Methodology 7.2.1 Basic simulati on model on economic burden, budgetary impact and cost-effectiveness of patient safety programmes (Task 11) In order to assess economic impact of patient safety programmes, a number of figures need to be calculated or extracted from publications which are then incorporated in a basic simulation model. The basic simulation model used for this report is delivered in a separate Microsoft Excel file. First, the cost of the programme represents the initial financial burden of impl e- menting the programme. Cost fig ures should include initial investments and running costs over a homogenous time period such that annual costs of the programme can be calculated and compared across programmes. Second, the effect of the programme is measured primarily in differences in clinical parameters among the study population. In terms of patient safety programmes, this is a reduction in incidence of one or several types of specific adverse events that are targeted by the intervention. This reduction can also be expressed as a reduction in the odds of the adverse event occurring.3 Next to changes in incidence of adverse events, mortality and hospital length of stay are often cited generic measurements of effects of patient safety intervention s that are measured in natural units. From the cost and one specific (clinical) effect of the programme, specific cost- effectiveness ratios can be computed. Theoretically, this allows a comparison of programmes regarding the cost per avoided case of an ad verse event type in a specific 3 Reduction in adverse events can be measured in absolute and relative numbers. For a comparison of costs and benefits of a programme, absolute figures of prevented adverse events are decisive . Relative reduction in inciden ce of adverse events (or a linea r reduction in the odds ratio of the adverse event occurring ) is crucial for generalization of effects of patient safety initiatives. Costs of unsafe care and cost -effectiveness of patient safety programmes February, 2016 50 setting, or a comparison of reduction in odds of adverse effects occurring. However, most patient safety interventions address more than one specific clinical effect, such as several types of healthcare -associated infections or several common adverse events, yet cost -effectiveness ratios only allow for one -dimensional outcome indic a- tors. Several alternative approaches are possible. One is to generalize adverse event incidence by using other indicators in natural units such as length of stay. The other common option is to sum over several adverse event types using adverse -event specific figures for cost or monetary -equivalent burden. These costs of adverse events are either extracted from other studies that try to quantify the impact of adverse events or are recorded in the evaluation of the patient safety intervention itself [40]. Different types of costs can be included in the tabul a- tion of expenditures due to adverse events (see chapter 5.2.3). Typically, costs of adverse events in the context of patient safety interventions refer to financial expend i- tures of the hospital, covered by the health insurance, the patient or ot her public budgets (see chapter 5.3.3 ). Once costs of adverse events are established, benefits of an intervention can be expressed in terms of fin ancial savings accrued via decreased incidence of adverse events. Thus, in a (partial) cost -benefit -analysis, the difference between costs of the intervention and savings through decreased financial costs to the hospital can be expressed in a cost-savings ratio . Interventions that feature ratios of savings to costs above 1 are considered efficient; which means that implementation serves to reduce expenses of the hospital. If the cost of the adverse event is limited to financial costs to the hospital, this c ost-benefit approach however ignores benefits in terms of gained quality of life of patients and therefore must be considered a partial analysis of benefits only. Note also that, if the effect of an intervention is expressed in an expected reduction in the odds of an event occurring, the base rate of adverse event incidence affects the cost -savings ratio of an intervention [79]. 7.2.2 Recommendations on prioritisation of patient safety strategies (Task 12) and further economic assessment of patient safety programmes (Task 13) The recommendations on prioritisation and further economic assessment are based on a combination of findings from literature and results of the simulation m odel. Regarding prioritisation of patient safety programmes the study aims to give unive r- salize suggestions, as the number of identified programmes can't draw a complete picture of implemented patient safety programmes. Particular attention is attracted to recommendations on further economic assessments, as this study discovered several methodological and publication errors and bias in this field. 7.3 Results 7.3.1 Basic simulation model on economic burden, budgetary impact and cost-effectiveness of p atient safety programmes (Task 11) Next to the patient safety intervention that we used in the mock simulation model [78], we performed a simulation of two other patient safety interventions. These two interventions, M\u00f8lbak [64] and Vermeulen [66] were identified in a hand search of European p atient safety interventions. Although Taylor et al. [65] report cost -efficient Costs of unsafe care and cost -effectiveness of patient safety programmes February, 2016 51 results, this study is not suitable for the simulation model that was developed in this study. All costs were standardized using health price level indicators (OECD) and are e x- pressed in 2014 EUR. Cost of the intervention In a first step, we calculate total costs of the intervention per patient admitted to the hospital. This cost figure is then adjusted for inflation and national health PLI and multiplied by hospital admissions throughout EU countries (Eurostat Database). Scenarios allow for various degree of hospitals in EU member countries that actually implement the intervention. Effect of the intervention and cost -effectiveness The effect is derived from the percent change in adverse events resulting from t he intervention, which is extracted from the publication. This percentage change in AE is then applied to all countries' estimate of the particular adverse effects prevalence rates that are affected by the intervention. In the base case scenario, we assume prevalence rates of the adverse event to be uniform across EU -countries, but this assumption can be relaxed in alternative scenarios. From the cost estimates and the effect estimates, we will calculate cost- effectiveness ratios for this intervention if ap plied to all, or a subset of, hospitals in EU countries. Accrued savings and efficiency In a third step possible savings attributable to the intervention are identified. For this purpose we multiply price -adjusted estimates of costs of the prevented adver se events with figures of prevented adverse events. This allows assessing the financial impact of patient safety interventions on EU member state healthcare expenditures. Sensitivity analysis explores the effect of changes in selected parameters such as prevalence rates or degree of implementation of an intervention. 7.3.1.1 Raschka et al. 2013 Raschka [78] evaluate an intervention that comprises quality and several patient safety that aim at reducing several types of hospital -acquired infections: MRSA infection and colonization, urinary tract infection, Clostridium difficile infection, VRE infection and colonization, Bacteremia, surgical site infection and central venous catheter -related bloodstream infection. The intervention was conducted in Vancouver Coastal Health, a Canadian health authority and includes a bundle of measures that were developed by the program directors in collaboration with the IPC team. Costs of unsafe care and cost -effectiveness of patient safety programmes February, 2016 52 Costs In total, cos ts of the intervention were CAD 6.7 million over a 4 -year period. These costs were converted to costs per hospitalization in 2014 -EUR adjusted for health price levels of EUR 10.44. An implementation of that intervention in all E U hospitals would thus cost EUR 844 million4. Effect The effect of the intervention is given in a reduction in prevalence of selected healthcare -associated infections. Difference in prevalence pre vs. post -intervention range from 1.52 % (CDI) to 24.79 % (SSI). In order to assess the effect of the intervention in European countries, base rate prevalence rates of the targeted HAI are cruc ial. However, we found no published figures on prevalence of all specific HAI mentioned in the study. Therefore, we assumed that baseline prevalence of HAI is identical in Canada and the EU. If this assumption is made, the intervention prevents in total 1 ,358,490 infections at a cost of EUR 621 per adverse event. Savings Costs of adverse events were established in the publication and converted to price - level adjusted 2014 -EUR and are given in Table 12. Savings due to the intervention are given by reduction in prevalence times cost of the adverse event. On average, the intervention prevents 15.97 % of targeted infections w ith attributable savings of EUR 14.10 per hospit alization. If applied to all EU hospitals, AE -related healthcare costs of 1,140 million could be prevented. Net benefit of the intervention is thus EUR 3.67 per hospitalization or 300 million for the entire EU. Table 12: Costs of adverse events and intervention effect MRSA inf. MRSA col. UTI EUR 809,83 EUR 3 8.277,7 8 EUR 3.960,7 2 EUR 5.392,24 EUR 7.175,5 1 Source: G\u00d6 FP 4 Different health price levels have been accounted for in that calculation. Costs of unsafe care and cost -effectiveness of patient safety programmes February, 2016 53 Sensitivity analysis With a ratio of benefits to costs of about 1:1.36 the cost -effectiveness of the interve n- tion heavily depends on the accuracy of input parameters, i.e. prevalence rates, cost of the adverse events and cost of the intervention. If, for example, intervention costs are increased by 20 % and costs of adverse events are decreased by 20 %, the intervention would not result in a reduction of healthcare expenditures and efficiency of the intervention would depend on the valuation of the benefits to other providers or non-monetary benefits, i.e. patient welfare. Likewise, lower prevalence rates mean a lower absolute effect of the intervention and a less favourable cost -savings rati o. If prevalence rates are assumed 25 % lower than in the reference hospital, the net benefit of the intervention is barely positive, and it is negative if prevalence rates are assumed 26 % lower than given in the publication. Further sensitivity analyses can be performed in the Excel tool provided as suppleme n- tary material. 7.3.1.2 M\u00f8lbak et al. 2013 M\u00f8lbak [64] use a decision analytic model to a ssess cost -effectiveness of an interve n- tion to reduce decubitus ulcers. The pressure ulcer bundle (PUB) consists of evidence - based initiatives implemented by ward staff and has been found to reduce prevalence of pressure ulcers by 50 % in previous research . Costs Costs of the programme were established using expert -opinion regarding time spent on additional tasks as well as costs of intervention material. The prevention pr o- gramme costs EUR 7.73 pe r patient and an additional EUR 66.66 for patients who already have developed a pressure ulcer or have tissue damage that could lead to a pressure ulcer ('stage 0 PU' ), resulting in a total cost of EUR 15.55 per patient5. Applied to all EU discharged pat ients, total costs would be EUR 6,557 million. Effect The effect of the intervention was assumed to be a reduction of the prevalence of pressure ulcers by 50 %. The total effect of that intervention in the EU can be obtained by multiplying the base rate of pressure ulcer prevalence (18.6 %) with the reduction (50 %) and the total number of hospital discharges in the EU (85.8 million), which results in an estimated prevention of almost 8 million pressure ulcers at a cost of EUR 157 per prevented PU. Furthermore, a 5 % mortality from pressure ulcers 5 Total cost of the intervention depends on the prevalence of pressure ulcers itself. We calculated adjusted costs using the publication's baseline and post -intervention prevalence rates of pressure ulcers, which resulted in per hospitalization costs between EUR 15.55 and EUR 25.36. For subsequent calculations, we made the simplifying assumptions that effect of the intervention is without delay and thus used the lower estimate for intervention cost. Costs of unsafe care and cost -effectiveness of patient safety programmes February, 2016 54 means that a reduction by 50 % would save about 404,000 lives at a cost of EUR 3,108 per life saved. These figures seem highly exaggerated. We thus performed a sensitivity analysis to test the impact of the intervention if only a subset of hospitalized patients are i n fact subject to the given prevalence rate of pressure ulcers (50 %, 25 %). Savings M\u00f8lbak et al. calculate costs of pressure ulcer treatment from costs of a number of possible complications and respective probabilities. On average, treatment of pressure ulcers causes healthcare e xpenditures of standardized EUR 435.76. A reduction in prevalence from 18.6 % to 9.3 % would the refore result in savings of EUR 24.98 per hospitalization, or in EUR 2,020 million if applied EU -wide. Sensitivity analysis The result s of this study depend heavily on the rather high numbers of pressure ulcer prevalence and mortality. We thus performed a sensitivity analysis to test the impact of the intervention if prevalence of pressure ulcers were lower. If prevalence is 8 % across a ll EU countries, cost of the intervention drops to EUR 9.96 per hospitalization, and sav ings per hospitalization to EUR 19.61, for a total net benefit (EU -wide) of EUR 604 million. Net benefit remains positive if prevalence rate of pressure ulcers is abov e 3.5 %. A lower exposure of hospitalized patients to the risk of obtaining a pressure ulcer would leave costs and savings per patient at risk unchanged but reduce the total impact of the intervention in terms of net benefit and lives saved. If only 75 % (50 %) of patients are at risk, the intervention would reduce EU -wide health expenditures by EUR 1,515 million (EUR 1,010 million) and save 303,500 (202,000) lives. Other sensitivity analyses can be performed using the Excel tool provided. 7.3.1.3 Vermeulen et al . 2014 Vermeulen [66] evaluate an electronic medication ordering system, consisting of a computerized physician order entry (CPOE) system with a Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) in two Dutch hospitals. The aim of this intervention is to reduce medication errors (ME) by providing dosage and drug -drug interaction alerts, and subsequently reducing preventable adverse drug events (pADE). Costs Costs of the intervention consist of personnel use, hard - and software and impleme n- tation costs. The cost of the CPOE/CDSS system e xceeds that of the previously used paper -based medication order system by standardized EUR 2.28 per patient -day. Since the two intervention hospitals feature an average length of stay of 13 days Costs of unsafe care and cost -effectiveness of patient safety programmes February, 2016 55 instead of the OECD -reported average LOS in the Netherlands o f 5 days, costs of the programme has been adjusted to 5.93 per patient -day6. Effect At baseline, 55 % of medication orders had at least one error, and 15.5 % of medic a- tion orders had medication orders that caused adverse drug events. 6 months after implem entation of the intervention, these figures dropped to 17 % and 7.3 %, respectively. The authors conduct a regression analysis to control for time trends in these error rates and find that there is no sufficient evidence to link the improvement in the err or rates to the intervention. The time trend in the model dominates the intervention period dummy, which features and insignificant coefficient. The remainder of this chapter will however assume that the drop in the error rate and pADE rate can in fact be attributed to the intervention. If that is the case, cost of prev enting a medication error is EUR 3.18 and cost of preventing a pADE is 330,72 (ICER). Savings The publication does not give any costs for adverse drug events. In our literature search, we fo und costs of error -related ad verse drug events between EUR 300 and EUR 4,800 . If we assume a pADE to cost about EUR 1,500, the intervention would result in EU -wide savings of EUR 8,934 million and a total net benefit of EUR 5,796 million. Sensitivity anal ysis The authors conduct a sensitivity analysis in which they adjust both costs of CPOE/CDSS systems and paper -based systems by \u00b120 % in several scenarios. In the least favourable case, i.e. cheaper paper -based systems and more expensive CPOE/CDSS systems, the cost of preventing a pADE r ises to about EUR 1,500. In that case, the intervention would increase net health -care spending, and any net beneficial effect of the intervention would depend on the valuation patient welfare. In the most favourable case, CPOE/CDSS are in fact less costly than the paper -based alternative. In that case, ICER of preventing a pADE would be negative; implementing the more effective version in terms of patient safety would save money before benefits in terms of prevented adverse events are considered. Further sensitivity analyses can be performed usin g the Excel tool provided . 6 This retains patient -days as cost reference, but corrects for the fact that a higher patient turn over results in more medication orders. Costs of unsafe care and cost -effectiveness of patient safety programmes February, 2016 56 7.3.2 Recommendations on prioritisation of patient safety strategies (Task 12) The recommendations on prioritisation of patient safety strategies are assembled from general recommendations on the Council Recommendations of the European Union ' on patient safety, including the prevention and control of healthcare associated infections' [1] and findings from identified cost-effective programmes and the simulation model. The Council Recommendations serve as general recommendations on the execution of patient safety programmes. The recommendations on prioritisation give a step b y step guidance on choosing from more than one programme in order to invest resources efficiently. Council Recommendations in context with this study The Council Recommendatio ns of the European Union above [1] suggest their member states advanc ing patient safety issues on diverse levels. The ambitions to increase patient safety and to reduce adverse events should be realised by strengthening the issue at national levels. However this attempt disregards the different health care systems of its member states . The implementation of the path for implementing the recommendations in detail is not being sketched. These activities should be adopted by the European member states. The recommendations serve more as a guideline for a common objective for an increased p atient safety. Costs of unsafe care and cost -effectiveness of patient safety programmes February, 2016 57 Not all of t he extracted patient safety programmes out of task 11 are European programmes. Anyway, a comparison on how far the selected programmes correspond to the recommendations of the European Union can be executed and the selected programmes can be analysed concerning the Council Recommendations to prioritise patient safety programmes in a structured manner. In particular, in its report to the Council the European Commission suggests a list of actions to implement. Not all of these measures can be evaluated based on the reviewed patient safety programmes. Table 13: Council recommendations and their implications for identified programmes Recommended action Comment Adequate risk management plans, structures and actions Systematic risk management and established guidelines how to contain risk were crucial aspects in the success of interventions. Particularly, t he Pressure Ulcer Bundle features risk assessment and risk control for patients at risk of developing pr essure ulcers [62]. Adequate numbers of specialised infection control staff in hospitals and other healthcare institutions; While infection control is very important; simply raising the number of people who are designated to be responsible for infection control may not be enough. Successful programmes integrate infection control in a comprehensive patient safety strategy, where risk management and awareness of staff regarding the dangers of infections play important roles [62]. Sufficient isolation capacity for patients infected or colonised with clinically relevant microorganisms in acute care hospitals; No reviewed patient safety programme focussed on that particular method. Standardised surveillance of alcohol hand rub consumption and/or measurement of compliance with good hand hygiene practices; No reviewed patient safety programme focussed on that particular method. Training for patients, families and informal carers using also ICT tools; No reviewed patient safety programme focussed on that particular method. Regular updating and dissemination of the guide on patient safety education and training for health professionals; While there has been substantial effort on improving guidelines, there is often a gap to clinical practice. This is due to the large number of relevant guidelines and barriers in changing the behaviour of health professionals. On-going training and education of staff in p atient safety is thus a crucial success factor for patient safety programmes (see chapter 6.3.2). An interventions that aim at improving guideline adherence succeeded in improving adherence to guidelines, which resulted in cost -savings [65]. No reviewed patient safety programme addressed the guide on patient safety education. Reporting as a tool to enhance a patient safety culture in the EU: regular updating and dissemin a- tion of g uidelines on the implementation and functioning of reporting and learning systems. No reviewed patient safety programme focussed on that particular method. Source: G\u00d6 FP Costs of unsafe care and cost -effectiveness of patient safety programmes February, 2016 58 More generally, following subheadings represent Council R ecommendations of the European Union on patient safety. The passage below refers the topic to the identified programmes in literature . Support the establishment and development of national policies and pr o- grammes on patient safety On the basis of the selec ted programmes it cannot clearly determined if political ambitions exist in respective countries. One of the picked abstracts describes a patient safety programme rolled out in Michigan, a United States member state where about 108 intensive care units are engaged [41]. The programme was also rolled out in other North -American states, more information can be found on the website of the MHA Keystone Center ( www.mha.org ). The other programmes and practices have been conducted primary in selected hospitals as pilot studies . Two papers seem to have political s upport in the background, but it could not be confirmed that it is so. Recommendation: On an international/European basis efforts to enhance patient safety exist in form of the Recommendations of the Council of the European Union above and the Recommendations of the Coun cil of Europe on patient safety and several endeavours to boost patient safety such as WHO projects (e.g. High 5 Project by WHO in 2007). All these recommendations and activities can constitute the basis for national patient safe ty strategies. These strategies can have a limited duration of validity and should run subsequently through a review process. The results should then build the basis for a revised version of new patient safety strategies. The publication of the results and discussion on an international level could increase the effect that countries learn from each other. Empower and inform citizens and patients It is recommended by the European Council that patient organisations and represent a- tives should be involved in th e development of policies and programmes on patient safety. Furthermore information should be disseminated to patients on patient safety standards, risk and safety measures which are in place to reduce or prevent errors and harm, the right being informed t o facilitate patient choice and decision -making and complaints procedures and available remedies and redress and the terms and conditions applicable. Consideration of possibilities of development of core compete n- cies in patient safety for patients. All the se mentioned points may have played a decisive role in the development of the presented programmes, but information about these points could not be extracted. Recommendation: There is still need for more transparency on how facilities ensure patient safety in their organisation. Quality outcome measures shown in a public accessible website/database would help to empower and inform citizens and patients. Based on that patients could make more informed decisions for planned surgical interventions. Support the establishment or strengthen blame -free reporting and learning systems on adverse events While the selected papers do not disclose explicitly if they take a reporting and learning system into consideration of their programme (but implemented surveillance systems for infection control), only one programme contains a reporting and learning system where it also occupies a central position [58]. Due to the fact that the latter programme is a hospital -wide programme we could not identify if there was a special Costs of unsafe care and cost -effectiveness of patient safety programmes February, 2016 59 political ambition for implement ation. The reporting and learning system was the greatest source of harm report and its implementation considerably influenced the outcome for decreasing adverse events in the hospital. The E uropean Council recom- mends E U member -states to support the establishment or strengthen blame -free reporting and learning systems on adverse events that e ncourage healthcare workers to actively report through the establishment of a reporting environment which is open, fair and non -punitive. Recommendation: Our analysis show just as well that an establishment of transparent error (and near -misses) reporting systems contribute significantly to enhance patient safety in health care facilities. As shown by the European Commission, Patient Safety and Quality of Care working group [80] the most important function of a reporting system is to use the results of data analysis and investigations to improve healthcare directly and help healthcare professionals to do safer work. Promote, at the ap propriate level, education and training of healthcare workers on patient safety There is no doubt, that the aim to reduce adverse events cannot be achieved without involving the human resources component . All selected programmes consider educ a- tion and trai ning of healthcare workers on patient safety (including training on electronic systems) . While there is more need of training in the implementation phase, continuous training and communication on patient safety among all involved medical staff members are absolutely necessary. An apparently helpful method to educate involved employees is to train front line staff members to coach their peers on effective use of error prevention techniques [58]. Planning and organizing team meetings to generate a common point of view on patient safety issues are necessary as well. Recommendation: There is a need for the reduction of barriers to implement patient safety practices in clinical practice. This may be achieved by the encouragement of independent/scientific/patient safety (review) boards in hospitals. Furthermore education initiatives fo r decision makers in facilities for patient safety should be established as well as continuous trainings for medical staff on patient safety practi c- es. Patient safety affairs should be comprehensively implemented in the curriculum of medical universities. Classify and measure patient safety at c ommunity level, by working with each other and with the Commission This European Council recommendation cannot be analysed related to the selected programmes as the studies give no information on classifying and meas uring at community level . Recommendation: The lack of adequate information on these points could be e x- plained by two possible scenarios . Either no classification and measuring at community level exists or the studies suffer from deficits in reporting. For the latter case, as mentioned earlier, more transparency and better reporting is needed. In case that countries, regions or other geographical areas lack of cooperation on a community level, more collab oration is strongly recommended, also according to th e next point 'working with each other'. Costs of unsafe care and cost -effectiveness of patient safety programmes February, 2016 60 Share knowledge, experience and best practice by working with each other, with the Commission and relevant European and international bodies and develop and promote research on patient safety As the previous recommendation by the European Council, there is little information on this point . Although not reported it is assumed that sharing knowledge, experience and best practice is common practise in health care institutions (internaly). Anyhow, one of the selec ted programmes [22] mentions that transparency is widely considered essential to creating and maintaining a high -reliability -organisation. Hospital internal and external transparency has been increased. All data from the preventable harm index which provides a summation of ha rm events occurring in eight different domains are posted in the intranet. The hospital also posts the rate of serious safety events on its Website ( www.nationwidechildrens.org ). Raschka et al. [78] show that they share their data with other hos pitals participating in the Canadian Nosocomial Infection Surveillance Program. They could reveal that in other hospitals the MRSA rate did not change significantly while in the facilities where the programme has been implemen t- ed it decreased dramatically. The decline in rates appeared to coincide with an increase in hand hygiene compliance. These examples bear that sharing knowledge, experience and best practice can be modelled on other healthcare providers and how important promoting research on these top ics is to enhance work on patient safety. Recommendation: There is more need on transparency of data and patient safety issues. The collaboration on a national as well as on a European level should be forced in this case. Research and publications on patie nt safety should additionally be fostered. A common database where European countries and facilities have the possibility to show their findings might be helpful. Incentive mechanisms could be a way to enhance research, e.g. with the aid of annually focal points and research prizes. The European Council recommends to adopt and implement a strategy at the appr o- priate level for the prevention and control of healthcare associated infections. In light of the conducted analysis strengthening the implementation of prevention and control measures at national or regional level to support the containment of healthcare associated infections as claimed by the European Council can be strongly recommen d- ed. Furthermore infection prevention and control at the level of the healthcare institutions in particular by encouraging healthcare institutions can be enhanced. All that should be realised by foster education and training of healthcare workers and providing the technical requirement for the implementation and operation o f survei l- lance systems. Recommendations on priori tisation of patient safety strategies In order to make a priori tisation on patient safety programmes a number of key indicators of programmes must be taken into consid eration for defining priorities: The prevalence of the problem addressed by the patient safety initiative . Literature suggests that healthcare -associated infections and adverse drug events are the most common adverse events, and efforts in reducing adverse events should include initiatives to reduce HAI and ADE. Costs of unsafe care and cost -effectiveness of patient safety programmes February, 2016 61 The relevance of (easily preventable) adverse events . Wrong site surgery and death from sepsis are examples for adverse events that incur very high and prevention is possible with reasonable effort. As a result, high potential benefits suggest prioritisation of appropriate patient safety measures. The (established) cost -effectiveness of patient safety practices . Many patient safety practices are argued to be effective; however published evidence on effectiveness and cost -effectiveness in a clinical setting is rare. Ideally, patient safety programmes should be evaluated in a setting comparable to where impl e- mentation is planned. Furthermore, relative cost -utility would be an ideal indicator for prioritising patient safety programmes. Fo r a given AE (group), relevant patient safety interventions could be sorted by cost -utility ratio, i.e. net benefit in terms of QALYs per Euro spent. Unfortunately, a list of programmes sorted by cost -utility based on the publications identified in the lit erature search on patient safety would not meet reasonable quality criteria. This is due to four main reasons: Firstly, the small number of economic evaluations of patient safety programmes means that for most groups of adverse events that only one or eve n no economic evaluation of a patient safety programme is available. Secondly, high variability in prevalence rates and cost estimates of adverse events as well as varying healthcare price level indicators across or even within EU - countries leads to a hig h range of cost -effectiveness in cost -effectiveness of p a- tient safety programmes7. Thirdly, publications often evaluate interventions that comprise several patient safety practices, hence effects and costs8 of the intervention cannot be attributed to a si ngle patient safety practice. Fourthly, as no evaluation of patient safety programmes uses QALYs or other health -related quality of life indicators as outcome indicator of the intervention; net monetary benefit, i.e. reduction of healthcare expenditures o f the hospital is the only indicator that could be used for a comparison of programmes that target different adverse events. Monetary savings of the hospital is however insufficient criteria, and limiting decisions regarding prioritization of patient safet y interve n- tions to that indicator would ignore potential improvements in patient welfare that could be realized in programmes that do not result in a positive net financial ben e- fit9. Due to scant evidence on patient safety programmes' cost -utility ratios and high variability in baseline prevalence of adverse events among hospitals, prioritization of programmes must follow a process that includes 7 If price level indicators are applied to cost of both adverse events and patient safety programmes, price level indicators cancel out and do not affect the cost -effectiveness ratio of an intervention. 8 Most pu blications do not disentangle costs of the intervention, cf. [40]. 9 For example, the patient safety programme evaluated by [58] features negative net monetary benefits, but succeeds in reducing harm and mortality in paediatric ICUs. Costs of unsafe care and cost -effectiveness of patient safety programmes February, 2016 62 Assessment of patient safety deficits in the specific setting Identification of appropriate patient safety pract ices Formulation of a precise implementation strategy, including (where appropriate) new guidelines and training of staff Economic evaluation of the intervention and dissemination of the evaluation results in academic journals. 7.3.3 Recommendations on further economic assessment of patient safety programmes (Task 13) After recomm endations on the prioritisation, this study also aims to give recommend a- tions on further economic assessment of patient safety programmes. The study will provide, as far as possible, recommendations on how such analyses should be taken forward and how countries can best undertake economic evaluations of investments in patient safety. The first part of this chapter gives r ecommendations on cost - effectiveness and efficiency indicators, a f ramework and guidelines for performing economic burden studies and cost -effectiveness analyses in patient safety as well as an assessment of feasibility analysis on periodical surveillance based on economic burden studies and cost -effectiveness and efficie ncy analyses in patient safety programmes. The second and final part gives concluding thoughts on the economic evaluation of patient safety programmes. Recommendations on cost -effectiveness and efficiency indicators The task of cos t-effectiveness and effic iency indicators is to inform decisions regarding implementation of programmes and to aid ranking and prioritization of patient safety programmes. To this end, they relate costs of interventions and outcomes of interve n- tions in a one -dimensional measure. Both costs and outcomes of interventions may be difficult to establish. Regarding costs, publications are often vague, do not itemise total intervention costs or are not specific a bout which costs are included. Likewise, difficulties in measuring intervent ion outcomes entail conceptual difficulties. Generally, the outcome of a patient -safety intervention is to reduce the prevalence of adverse events. The savings associated with that reduction can be deducted from the cost of the adverse event. Several impor tant aspects need to be kept in mind regar d- ing costs of adverse events: Publications should be clear about which costs are included - ideally, all costs would be covered, but often, publications only consider monetary costs a c- crued to the hospital sector. Some publications discuss costs of increased mortality or decreased produ c- tivity [81]. In general, these costs are difficult to assess but may have a large impact on the total sum of adverse event costs. Neglect of non -monetary costs or costs accrued to other stakeholders leads to a distortion in optimal levels of investment in patient sa fety (see discu s- sion on above ). In order to compare different types of adverse event, the cost of adverse events and thus savings realized in patient safety interventions should be expressed in Euros and in changes in mortality. Other cost categories, such as reduction in hospital length of stay, are appropriate for the analysis of specific healthcare policy targets. Costs of unsafe care and cost -effectiveness of patient safety programmes February, 2016 63 For different adverse events, different units for prevalence and costs may be appropr i- ate. For example, prevalence of wrong site surgery shou ld be measured in terms of per surgical operation and not per hospital day, because only surgical operations involve the risk of wrong site surgery. Healthcare -associated infections, on the other hand, can occur every day of the inpatient stay and should b e based on the number of days spent in the hospital. Transferability of outcomes Cost-effectiveness indicators report the relationship between costs and outcomes of a specific intervention. In order to evaluate the effects of that intervention in a differ ent setting, costs and outcomes must be transferred. Costs can be transferred by mult i- plying per patient -day costs, per hospital admission costs Relative scaling of intervention outcomes seems more plausible than assuming that the same absolute effect, i.e . 10 less cases of postoperative sepsis would occur. This reasoning is in line with the idea of medical errors occurring if a series of balances and checks fail - the Swiss Cheese model [82]. An additional patient safety practice would correspond to an additional layer in Figure 4. Conditional on the distribution of holes in the other Cheese layers being similar in hospitals A and B, the relative effect of the intervention can be expected to be the same. Figure 4: The Swiss Cheese Model Source: User Davidmack, Wikimedia Commons This means that the effect of an intervention decreases with the prevalence of the adverse event that it addresses, and the efficiency of the interventions depends on the current level of prevalence . Following that logic, the effect of the intervention would be measured in Euro per occurrence of the adverse event in the baseline scenario times the adverse event reduction rate. Costs of the intervention should be measured on the same basis as the baseline rate of adverse events, e.g., per patient -days, hospitalizations or per surgical operations. Based on costs and occurrence -specific savings, a specific baseline level of occurrence of the adverse event , above which a given intervention is economically efficient , can be calculated. The best choice for cost -effectiveness or efficiency indicators thus depends on the nature of the adverse event that is to be avoided by the intervention. Costs of unsafe care and cost -effectiveness of patient safety programmes February, 2016 64 Recommendations for a framework and guidelines for performing economic burden studies and cost -effectiveness analyses in patient safety The main problem in assessing the economic burden of adverse events is poor data availability. Publications that assess the prevalence or the economic burden of adverse events within a country often rely on data from single hospitals, hospital wards or ICUs. Given high variations in prevalence rates of adverse events within and across countries, these figures may not be representative. Furthermore, publications that evaluate the economic burden of adverse events are rare, and for some regions of Europe, no publications were identified. It is therefore essential to, systematically collect data on patient safety related incidents , and obtain reliable cost figures for these adverse events in European countries, with a special focus on countries where such stu dies have not yet been performed. Several publications discuss which patient safety related indicators should be included in periodic surveillance or how incidence reporting systems should be designed [83- 85]. Alternatively, existing diagnosis coding systems could be used to infer some adverse events from routine data [86]. Feasibility analysis on periodical surveillance based on economic burden studies and cost -effectiveness and efficiency analyses in patient safety program mes Ideally, periodic monitoring of patient safety indicators would assist in setting prior i- ties for patient safety policy. However, data on prevalence of adverse events is not accurate enough to draw conclusions regarding regional differences or trends in patient -safety related indicators. These limitations need to be addressed before systematic assessment of efficiency of patient safety programmes can be performed. We thus deem any routine/periodical evaluation of economic burden or efficiency of medical care as not feasible. Final Discussion According to the well -known formula in risk economics, reduction of risk is efficient if and only if marginal cost of caution is lower than the marginal damage caused by the adverse event. Figure 5 depicts this relation. It is typically assumed that marginal cost of caution increases with the level of caution. The reason for this is straightforward. Consider several possible optio ns to exercise caution. If these are ordered by their efficiency, a rational decision maker would consider implementing the most efficient options first. This results in a decreasing marginal effect per cost unit, as less efficient methods of caution are i mplemented. For the same reason, marginal damage of the adverse event reduced by exercising caution decreases as the level of caution increa s- es. Costs of unsafe care and cost -effectiveness of patient safety programmes February, 2016 65 Figure 5: Rational level of caution Source: G\u00d6 FP In Figure 5, the optimal level of caution is given by . Note that the reasoning behind this illustration puts the distinction between preventable and non -preventable adverse events into perspective . With the necessary amount of caution, every adverse event would be preventable. However, caution exceeding level is not efficient in that exercising caution incurs more costs than the actual adverse event. In case of patient safety adverse events, no t all costs of damage are covered by the same decision maker, and some costs are non -monetary and therefore difficult to assess. Rational actors only consider costs of caution that accrue to themselves when deciding the optimal level of caution . If a pr oportion of costs of adverse events are non-monetary or do not accrue to hospital decision makers, the optimal level of caution is greater than . Figure 6: Optimal level of caution (total cost) Source: G\u00d6 FP Figure 6 illustrates that exercising caution beyond level may be efficient if marginal cost of caution is below total cost of averted damage, which includes non -monetary Costs of unsafe care and cost -effectiveness of patient safety programmes February, 2016 66 costs and costs accrued to other stakeholders, such as patients or other healthcare providers. Interventions that aim to bring the level of caution to the optimal level face two types of barriers. Firstly, as many publications have argued consisten tly, it is difficult to raise awareness for patient safety. Secondly, exercising the socially optimal level of incurs a loss to the hospital operator. Health policy must thus not only promote patient safety initiatives, but also design and implement wa ys to reimburse operators for patient safety programmes that are efficient but incur extra costs. Costs of unsafe care and cost -effectiveness of patient safety programmes February, 2016 67 8 Conclusions With regard to the three main aims of this study we can draw the fo llowing concl u- sions. In general, due to widely spread search terms as \"patient safety\" and \"adverse events\" the literature search was a complex task. Identified studies are often based on incomparable study designs and lack of quality. Literature as well as experts give limite d information on adverse event groups and more detailed insights in specific adverse events. Therefore an integrated view on adverse events on a macro level is often hindered. The extraction of figures from literature give prevalence rates for adverse even t groups and the degree of preventability , whereat variation in certain groups can't be eliminated entirely. Identified studies deliver no evidence on differences of prevalence of adverse events within Europe. Variation in prevalence rates result from diff erences within studies and countries or regions , not between them . In general, literature shows that about 4 - 17 percent of patients experience adverse events, whereby 44 - 50 percent of these events are preventable. The first choice method to calculate t he economic burden of adverse events (link prevalence and costs) delivered implausible results due to a lack in adequate cost reporting and incomparable study designs in identified studies. Therefore we executed an alternative approach (share of health exp enditure) that delivered feasible results and a range of the economic burden of adverse events for all member states. The bottom -range of estimated direct costs for the public health care sector appear to be a minimum of EUR 2.8 b illion, or 0. 2 percent of HE, the upper -range costs appear to be a maximum of 84.6 billion or 6 percent of HE following international references . The results from two European reference s show direct costs of 21.2 billion or 1.5 percent of HE. Anyhow, a mayor finding of this study i s that primary studies of epidemiology and cos ts of adverse events are needed to gain a better grasp of the exact size of economic burden and factors influencing its magnitude. Another question that arises with the economic burden of adverse events is the perspective of costs and who bears the costs in different systems. Literature search on cost-effective patient safety programmes (or patient safety practices /interventions as referred to in literature) revealed a large number of studies. No studies reporte d inefficient programmes, only one cost-neutral study was ident i- fied. The majority of identified cost -effectiveness studies lack of adequate reporting of effects and/or cost and are therefore not applicable for further analysis in our simul a- tion model. Ele ven studies deliver sufficient information, only three out of eleven studies have been conducted in the European Union. These studies focus on labour efforts to prevent pressure ulcers, a theory based approach to implement clinical guidelines and the intro duction of electronic medication ordering systems . A basic simulation model was implemented in Microsoft Excel . It can be used to transfer information from existing cost -effective patient safety programmes to the EU member -states settings. The model calculates costs, effects, cost -effectiveness ratios and savings from selected patient safety programmes on country level for member states. The results of the model are provided in this report, the model itself was provided electronically. Calculation for three selected programmes show EU -wide savings of EUR 300 million for a programme to reduce several HAI, about EUR 2 billion for a programme to reduce pressure ulcers and about EUR 6 billion for implementing an electronic medication ordering system, consi sting of a computerized physician order entry system with a Clinical Decision Support System to prevent adverse drug events . Costs of unsafe care and cost -effectiveness of patient safety programmes February, 2016 68 This report aims to give recommendations on the prioritisation of patient safety programmes on the basis of identified studies and calculated cost -efficiency figures. In a first step the Council Recommendations of the European Union are reviewed and matched with the results of the identified literature. In a second step this study gives recommendations on how to choose between two or more patient safety programmes. In order to make a prioritisation on patient safety programmes a number of key indicators of programmes must be taken into consideration for defining priorities. These indicators are the prevalence of the problem, the releva nce of (easily prevent a- ble) adverse events and the (established) cost -effectiveness of patient safety practi c- es. Furthermore, relative cost -utility would be an ideal indicator for prioritising patient safety programmes, however the application this indicat or is problematic to several reasons. Due to scant evidence on patient safety programmes' cost -utility ratios and high variability in baseline prevalence of adverse events among hospitals, this study recommends that prioritization of programmes must follow a process that includes an assessment of patient safety deficits in the specific setting , the i dentification of appropriate patient safety practices , a f ormulation of a p recise implementation strategy and the incorporation of new guidelines (where appropr iate) and training of staff. Economic assessments of patient safety initiatives face two main challenges. The first one is a conceptual issue that is related to the definition of costs when applied to patient safety. When discussing costs of adverse events , many researchers report expenses of additional medical services that can be attributed to the adverse event, i.e. costs of increased length of stay etc. Costs to the patient are often neglected, because they are typically not included in micro - or macro costing methods. These hidden costs of decreased patient welfare or forgone wages are however also saved if adverse events are prevented. Ignoring them thus distorts economic analyses of patient safety initiatives. The second challenge is the low number and high variability in published figures on prevalence and costs of adverse events. National figures for costs of adverse events are often extrapolated from a very low number of hospitals; and both prevalence rates a nd costs of adverse events are known to vary substantially across and even within countries. This leads to very broad ranges in estimates of total cost of adverse events. The low number of publications and the high variability of both prevalence rates and costs makes it impossible to assess trends in costs or prevalence of adverse events on national levels. For most European countries we have found no figures on costs of adverse events. Further improvements in economic appraisal of patient safety thus rely on the precondition of a standardized system for periodic reporting and of adverse events in Europe.
