There is an increased risk of hospitalized and severe dengue in seronegative individuals starting about 30 months after the first dose. In areas of 70% dengue seroprevalence, over a 5- year follow -up: -For every 4 severe cases prevented in seropositive, there would be one excess severe case in seronegative per 1,000 vaccinees; -For every 13 hospitalizations prevented in seropositive vaccinees, there would be 1 excess hospitalization in seronegative vaccinees per 1,000 vaccinees. 11TDV summary with different regimensBetter multi- valent seroconversion frequencies with dose regimen in dengue- na\u00efveRR of dengue = 0.29 in those who received TDV compared with placeboCurrent formulation in Phase 3 clinical trial in Asia and Latin America (dosing: 0 & 3 months)Tota l 1794Grp DEN- 1DEN- 2DEN- 3DEN- 4Unk # cases 10 11 5 3 1 12All participants were monitored for episodes of febrile illness throughout the study.

This first analysis of the Tetravalent Immunization against Dengue Efficacy Study (TIDES) trial showed that the company's investigational live -attenuated tetravalent dengue vaccine (TAK -003) was efficacious in preventing dengue fever caused by any of the four serotypes of the virus.TV003/TV005 -NIH/Butantan vaccine Attenuated by deletions in 3\u00b4 UTR (3 and chimerization (1 component) -Contains 32 dengue proteins TV003 contains 3 log10PFU of each monovalent component, TV005 contains a 10- fold higher dose of rDEN2/430 Asymptomatic rash most common vaccine- associated adverse event (correlated with tetravalent antibody response) Viremia detected in ~65% vaccinees (all 4 components detected) component is 10 PFU 14rDEN130 rDEN2/430 rDEN330/31 rDEN430Current status and challenges of Dengue vaccines Dengvaxia just approved by FDA -ACIP to discuss its use in endemic US territories First vaccine to potentially need a rapid diagnostic test before administration (major challenge ahead) Takeda vaccine results to be denuded soon, will the safety signal be also an issue?
