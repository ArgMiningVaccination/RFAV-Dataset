Osteopathic physicians, DOs, assist the patient's innate capacity to heal by addressing the interrelationship of the body's nerves, muscles, bones and organs using the therapeutic application of manual techniques, Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment (OMT), to address the changes in body structure to improve physiologic function. [Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment (OMT)](https://findado.osteopathic.org/difference) As part of their education, DOs receive special training in the musculoskeletal system, your body's interconnected system of nerves, muscles and bones. Using OMT, your DO can effectively treat your muscles and joints to relieve pain, promote healing and increase overall mobility. OMT is often used to treat muscle pain, but it can also help provide relief for patients with asthma, sinus disorders, carpal tunnel syndrome and migraines. In many cases, OMT can be used to complement, or even replace, drugs or surgery. Traditional Chinese Medicine Traditional Chinese Medicine is an ancient practice of medicine from China, which has developed and evolved over thousands of years. The foundational philosophy has changed little over this period. One of it's basic concepts is that a vital energy flow, called Qi, is responsible for overall health. Any imbalance in the normal energy flow can cause disease and illness. This imbalance is most commonly thought to be caused by an alteration in the balance of the opposing and complementary forces of nature. These forces are called yin and yang. Another basic foundation of Traditional Chinese Medicine is a recognition that humans are microcosms of the larger world, interconnected to nature and subject to its forces. As such, balance between our lives and the natural world will lead us on the path towards a healthy life. Treatment in Traditional Chinese Medicine aims to restore equilibrium to the underlying imbalance causing disease. Treatments include: Acupuncture Moxibustion Cupping and Gua sha Tuina (manipulation treatment) Herbal formulas Qigong or Taiqi (movement exercises) Acupuncture Acupuncture is part of the ancient practice of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Traditional Chinese Medicine describes more than 2,000 acupuncture points throughout the human body connected by pathways or channels. These pathways create an energy flow, Qi, through the body that is responsible for overall health. Disruption of the energy flow can cause disease. By applying acupuncture needles to certain points throughout the body, the energy flow can be optimized which in turn improves health. [Studies](https://www.evidencebasedacupuncture.org/acupuncture-scientific-evidence/) have shown that acupuncture is effective for a variety of conditions including (but not limited to) the following: Pain conditions: Back and neck pain, Shoulder pain, Osteoarthritis, Headache and Migraine, Myofascial pain syndrome, Sciatica, Postoperative pain, Fibromyalgia, Tennis elbow Women's Health: Back or pelvic pain during pregnancy, Menopausal hot flashes, Chronic pelvic pain Mental Health: Anxiety, Depression, PTSD, Insomnia Cancer-related: Treatment related nausea and vomiting in cancer patients, Cancer pain, Cancer related fatigue, Aromatase-inhibitor induced arthralgia Other: Irritable bowel syndrome, Seasonal allergies, Urinary incontinence, Asthma, TMJ (Temporomandibular syndrome), Restless leg syndrome Classical Homeopathy Classical Homeopathy embraces a holistic, natural approach to treatment. The word Homeopathy translates to 'like disease.' Founded in 1796 by German physician, Dr. C.F. Samuel Hahnemann, the guiding principle of Classical Homeopathy is 'let likes cures like,' similia similibus curentur. This means the medicine given is like the disease that the person is expressing. In the practice of Homeopathic Medicine, after a comprehensive interview of the patient, evaluating physical, psychological and emotional characteristics, a homeopathic remedy is chosen most similar to the patient's characteristic totality. This remedy is given to the patient thus stimulating their ability to heal by means of \"let likes cures like.\" Homeopathic remedies are produced, according to FDA recognized Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States, from natural sources, whether vegetable, mineral or animal in nature.
