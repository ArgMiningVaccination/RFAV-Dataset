Horror movies, candy, wearing costumes without embarrassment... nothing I don't love about it (except for houses that give away raisins). Anyway, in your opinion, the best monster for horror movies? Think about it. Being seduced by a sexy vampire or being torn apart by a werewolf? Being chased by swarms of zombies or Frankenstein's monster? My vote would have to be evil children, like the Children of the Corn or those creepy ones from Village of the Damned. Nothing says evil more than the gleeful, innocent face of a child as it stabs his or her unfortunate victim.-- [Thanatos](/wiki/User:Thanatos) 23:24, 13 October 2009 (UTC) - I am well versed in horror (both books and movies) and I enjoy post-apocalyptic.

Adaptation is often overemphasized such that some biologists have invoked natural selection to explain almost any phenotypic difference, but many biological traits are not adaptive.\" In short, not only is the theory of evolution not based on chance, but scientists usually UNDER-EMPHASIZE CHANCE when forming their theories. Creationists are stupid.-- [Mustex](/wiki/User:Mustex) 01:59, 14 October 2009 (UTC) - I'd say that a lot of science actually over states chance and possibility. Hence why when they go on about theories being changable creatards use it as a stick to beat them with (and few \"evolutionists\" debating on the net are fully equipped to respond correctly to this). A lot of mutations aren't as random and chancy as people sometimes state, if they were, a genetic sequence like AGGCTAAGTCGCT could easily jump to TTGCGATATTGAGA just by chance!! (okay, this is extreme, but it's the impression I get from some bad explanations) Alas no, there is a slight amount of control and regulation of them. [moral](/wiki/User_talk:Armondikov)20:57, 14 October 2009 (UTC) - The point that being made is that scientists tend to downplay the importance of genetic drift in evolution. Alot of adaptive or neutral traits have certainly been lost, just by an unlucky roll of the dice.

They're pretty good at this...far better than they should be given only a 9-month period to determine how much energy will be available.

We're discussing price (about 2000) and he says, \"Business must be good!\" My reply was something like, 'Not bad, but it could always be better.\" This twit then gets a serious look on his face and says, \"Well, if you let God into your heart, then He'll make sure that all things are better for you\" and then proceeds to try and save me.

Finally cracked after 3 weeks (In the meantime I 'broke' 4 or 5 times when out in the pub or whatever, but I didn't really count that...) Giving up smoking seems easy after day 2 (When the nicotine is out) By the end of the first week you'll notice a constant sense of anxiety and self loathing, after the second week you'll begin to see absolutely everything in the world refers back to smoking, and everything you do will loose its enjoyment value because you'd have associated it all with smoking. - By week 3 you'll be back smoking. P.S- I smoke rolly tobacco, usually c. 30 roll ups a day. Even doing that is quite expensive so I do seriously reccomend stopping, if you have the willpower.

Unless you put them on some sort of grating that allows their shit to fall through, they're going to eat it. They're really disgusting when you think about it, just before you take a big bite out of that chicken sandwich.

Movies and books do and achieve different things, and as far as adaptations go, these just bring Discworld to the screen, they don't try to do the same humour as a book because that's impossible and it's silly to even try (LOTR has to practically rearrange everything to make it work as a film). Fanboys and purists going on about how the \"films aren't as good as the books\" are just missing the point entirely; by all means review them as films but to review them negatively in the context of comparing them to a book is quite immature and just plain wrong.

It's not. It's far more swords and sorcery than science fiction. I don't want to get into the whole science/fantasy vs science fiction debate (Asimov vs Clarke, for instance), because that's a whole other thing, but the \"Like sci-fi, never heard of Discworld\" voters are really saying \"I like cheese but I don't like chalk\". - - Ignore the purists, the two screen adaptations are actually pretty good, and although I've only seen the one cartoon (Soul Music), I enjoyed it quite a lot. Movies and books do and achieve different things, and as far as adaptations go, these just bring Discworld to the screen, they don't try to do the same humour as a book because that's impossible and it's silly to even try (LOTR has to practically rearrange everything to make it work as a film). Fanboys and purists going on about how the \"films aren't as good as the books\" are just missing the point entirely; by all means review them as films but to review them negatively in the context of comparing them to a book is quite immature and just plain wrong. At the very least they certainly could have been much, much worse. - Still ...If there are several - which is the least worst?-- - Don't bother. If you've read the book(s) then you'll be disappointed at the missing humour, and if you haven't read the books you'll be wondering what all the fuss is about and probably never read a Pratchett book. - There are screen adaptations?

Sometimes this is just to creep people out, other times its to promote a movie or something, but I know many of them are just plain wrong. The most extreme case I've seen is \"Fang vs Fiction\" which was essentially a documentary claiming that there are actually ancient documents claiming that vampires once enslaved werewolves, and they ended up rebelling and fighting a major battle, and attempting to imply that their war continues in secret to this day (it was to promote the movie Underworld).

Its not that I believe the folklore, its that it pisses me off when people basically commit fraud by claiming to present historical fact, and lying through their teeth.

I could tell you right now that \"medieval Bulgarians believed that long exposure to garlic could turn one into a werewolf, which would later combine with the idea of garlic repelling vampires and giving rise to the notion of the opposition of the two supernatural beings.\" That sounds pretty reasonable, even though it is a blatant lie off the top of my head. But dozens of crappy little books in the bargain bins at bookstores are filled with only slightly less blatant lies. It would take a professional folklorist to say that people didn't believe such-and-such, or a specific expert in each related field (like a historian of the Orthodox Church for your provided example, or in Bulgarian lore for my lie). - To get a good idea of what some people did certainly believe, the easy go-to would be medieval Church lore.

It came across as highly sensationalized, but there were some things I could have accepted had they come from a more reputable source. It basically boils down to this: There was a chapter Bram Stoker left out of Dracula that included reference to another, female, aristocrat vampire who was Dracula's rival. Her name sounds alot like a real-world Noblewoman who drank wolves milk to try to have a son, and finally had one in her early 40s. Later, she started to get sick, and used a massive number of folk remedies. Her symptoms, combined with the large number of potions she was using on herself, may have caused some people to suspect she was a vampire and/or witch. She was autopsied, which was unusual for aristocrats at the time, and the doctor was paid an abnormally large sum, which may have been to keep him quiet about the fact that he was performing rites to keep her body dead. Someone seems to have repainted the head in a portrait of her, possibly as a symbolic beheading. And her grave was sealed in an unusual way, which may have been to keep her dead. (yeah, sensationalized, but less absurd than some.

I truly believe he was \"savedtm\" simply as an excuse to be superior, cranky and awful to other people. true story: He had a screaming fit at the rehearsal dinner for my wedding because we did not pray before the meal. He repeated more and more loudly:If you don't pray, you don't eat! We were at my home. The party was put on by my (then future) wife and I without any help or input from him. He left in a huff. My entire point was that Andy and Conservapedia are a whole separate and distinct form of awfulness that comes from some cocktail of wealth, naivete, dishonesty and stupidity. Having said that, many Christians are decent people if you discount the whole irrational and sometimes destructive beliefs thing. Also, I suspect that most/many self-professed Christians just believe in believing, but they'd never be crazy enough to apply that crap to real life.
