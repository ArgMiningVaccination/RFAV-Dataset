The NSQF sets common principles and guidelines for a nationally recognized qualification system for Schools, Vocational education & Training institutions, Technical education institutions, Colleges and Universities. It is envisioned that NSQF will foster transparency of qualification, cross - sectoral as well as student-centric learning and aid learner's mobility amid different qualifications, which consequently will promote lifelong learning. The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 recommends that children's learning exposure at school must be not be confined to four walls of the classroom. This perception makes a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system and causes a gap between the schools, home, community and the workplace. This student workbook, which has been developed keeping in view the set by the Healthcare Sector Skill Council (HSSC) for the Role of Dietetic Assistant/Dietary Assistant is meant for students who have passed classXI. The success of education in schools depends on the steps that principals and teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative and on-the-job training activities. The students' handbook has been conceptualized, developed and reviewed by Dietetics experts of AIIMS, IGNOU and MoHFW and their contributions are deeply acknowledged. The utility of the handbook will be decided by the qualitative improvements it will bring in the journey of teaching and learning. The feedback and suggestions on the content by the teachers and other stakeholders will be of enormous importance to us in reflecting, reviewing and refining our work.

It deals with issues such as altered nutritional requirements associated with the disease, its severity, malnutrition and many such issues. Nutrition is a vital part of medical therapy as adequate nutrition support can go a long way in improving patient's medical outcomes. The importance of nutrition in the prevention of illness and disease has long been established. Let us know more about clinical and therapeutic nutrition. Role of Dietitian in Health Care As a student of nutrition and dietetics, it must be evident to you by now that the diet and the food we eat have a direct and significant impact on our health. Eating a healthy balanced diet improves the quality of our life, whereas, a poor diet may lead to morbidity and disease. Dietetics is defined as the application of the science of nutrition to the human being in health and disease. In fact, dietetics deals with feeding individuals based on the principles of nutrition. Therefore, dietetics is the science and art of human nutritional care. Clinical Dietetics is the application of dietetics in a health care institutional setting. Clinical nutrition deals with the prevention, diagnosis and management of nutritional and metabolic changes related to acute and chronic diseased and conditions caused by a lack of excess of energy and nutrients. You will come across the terms like diet therapy, therapeutic diets while studying clinical dietetics. Let us understand these terminologies as used in the context of dietetics.UNIT - 01 Chapter 01 THERAPEUTIC NUTRITION Learning Objectives : After reading this chapter, the students will be able to: 1. Define the terms dietetics, clinical nutrition & therapeutic diet. 2. Explain and specify the role of dietitian in health care.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS4Diet therapy is a branch of dietetics concerned with the use of food for therapeutic purpose. Diet therapy is a broad term used for the practical application of nutrition as a preventive or corrective treatment of a disease. It deals with the recovery from illness by giving a nutritious diet and prevention of disease. It also involves the modification of the existing dietary lifestyle to promote good health. The principles of diet therapy are to: maintain good nutritional condition, improve deficiencies or disease, if any, provide adequate rest to the body, help metabolize the nutrients, and make changes in body weight, when necessary. Diet therapy may include following specialized dietary regimes or meal plans. These specialized diet regimens or meal plans are called therapeutic diets. A therapeutic diet may be defined as a meal plan that controls the intake of certain foods or nutrients. They are an adaptation of the normal/ regular diet. Some common examples of therapeutic diets include a clear liquid diet, diabetic diet, renal diet, gluten-free diet, low-fat diet, high fibre diet etc. Therapeutic diets are usually prescribed by a trained dietitian, nutritionist or physician. Role of Dietitian in Nutrition Care Dietitian is an expert in dietetics, dealing with human nutritional care. A dietitian applies the science and principles of human nutrition to help people understand the relationship between food and health. She makes appropriate dietary choices to attain and maintain health and to prevent and treat illness and disease. Dietitians work in a wide variety of roles. For example, clinical, public health or community, food service, administrative, freelance/consultancy, research or teaching capacity. However, you will find that majority of dietitians are clinical dietitians working in hospitals, nursing homes and other health care facilities or specialized institutes/units to provide nutritional care to patients with a variety of health conditions. They also provide dietary consultations to patients and their families. The roles most likely to be played by the clinical dietitian include: collecting, organizing and assessing the data related to health and nutritional status of individuals, groups and communities,FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 5 review and analyze patients' nutritional requirements and goals to make appropriate dietary recommendations, develop and execute nutrition care plans and monitor, follow up and evaluate these plans and take necessary measures wherever required, calculate the nutritional value of food/meals planned, prescribe therapeutic diets and special nutrition support and feeding regimens, oversee the preparation of special diets, special nutrition formulas for patients who are critically ill and require special feeding through oral, enteral or parenteral routes, plan and prepare basic menus and assist in supervising food service personnel in the preparation and serving of meals, schedule work assignments in the dietary unit to facilitate effective operation. EXERCISES Q-1 Define the term 'Dietetics'. Q-2 What is clinical dietetics? Q-3 List the principles of diet therapy. Q-4 Write any five roles played by a clinical dietitian. Q-5 Explain a therapeutic diet with the help of an example/ examples.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 7A therapeutic diet is a qualitative/quantitative modification of a normal regular diet that has been tailored to suit the changing nutritional needs of patient/individual. It is used to improve specific health/disease conditions. It is a planned diet to supplement the medical or surgical treatment. Balanced diet contains a variety of foods in such quantities and proportions that the need for energy, proteins, vitamins, minerals, fats and other nutrients is adequately met for maintaining health and well being. Refer to Figure 2.1 which illustrates routine hospital diets. Figure 2.1: Routine hospital dietsUNIT - 01 Chapter 02 THERAPEUTIC DIETS Learning Objectives : After reading this chapter, the students will be able to: 1. Explain the diets of altered consistencies. 2. Discuss the adaptation of normal diet to therapeutic diets.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS8A normal or general diet in a hospital setting is a balanced diet that meets the nutritional requirement of an individual/patient. It is given when the individual's medical condition does not permit any specific modification. Most hospitals follow simple dietary recommendations [given by ICMR (Indian Council for Medical Research) for the Indian population] while planning the general diet. It is planned keeping the ICMR five food groups in mind so that the optimum amount of all nutrients are provided. Further, since the patient is hospitalized or on bed rest, a reduction of 10% in energy intake should be made. The diet provides approximately 1600 to 2200Kcal and contains around 180 to 300g carbohydrates, 60 to 80g of fat and 40 to 70 g of protein. Figure 2.1 also illustrates the soft diet and the liquid diets which are examples of therapeutic diet. In addition to these, there may be other modified diets which are given to individuals/patients as a part of their therapeutic needs. The reasons for altering the diets may include: for essential or lifesaving treatment: For example, people diagnosed with celiac disease, are put on a gluten free diet, to replenish patients who are malnourished because of diseases such as cancer and intestinal diseases by providing a greater amount of a nutrient such as protein, to correct deficiencies and maintain optimum nutritional status, to provide rest or relieve an affected organ such as in gastritis, to adapt to the body's ability to digest, absorb, metabolize or excrete: For example, a low-fat diet provided in fat malabsorption, to adjust the body to the mode of food intake. For example, in case of patients with cancer of esophagus, tube feeding is recommended when patients cannot swallow food by mouth, to exclude certain foods due to food allergies or food intolerance, to adjust to the body's mechanical difficulties, for example for elderly patients with denture problems, changing the texture/consistency of food recommended due to problems with chewing and/or swallowing, to increase or decrease body weight/body composition when required, for example as in the case of obesity or underweight, as a helpful treatment, alternative or complementary to drugs. For example in diabetes or in hypertension.FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 9Types of Dietary Adaptations for Therapeutic Needs A diet may need to be modified and adjusted in many ways before it meets the therapeutic needs of an individual patient. These adaptations may include: change in the consistency of foods, such as liquid diet, bland diet, low fibre diet, high fibre diet, increase or decrease in energy value of the diet such as low-calorie diet for weight reduction, high-calorie diet for weight gain, increase or decrease in specific nutrients or type of food consumed, such as sodium-restricted diet, lactose restricted diet, high fibre diet, high potassium diet, exclusion of spices and condiments, such as bland diets, avoiding specific foods such as allergy diets, gluten-free diets, adjustment in the ratio and balance of proteins, fats and carbohydrates such as diabetic diet, renal diet and cholesterol-lowering diets, test diets: These are single meals or diets lasting for one or a few days that are given to patients in connection with certain tests e.g. the fat absorption test used to determine if steatorrhea is present, change in the frequency of meals, feeding intervals, re-arrangement of the number such as diabetic diet, diet for peptic ulcer disease.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS10A. Diets of Altered Consistency Therapeutic diets are modified for their consistency and texture to fit the nutritional needs. Some individuals may require a clear liquid diet, while others a fully liquid diet or soft diet based on their health and medical condition. Figure 2.2 represents the modified diets based on consistency. Figure 2.2: Modifications in consistency a) Liquid Diet consists of foods that can be served in liquid or strained form at room temperature. They are usually prescribed in febrile states, postoperatively i.e. after surgery when the patient is unable to digest solid foods. It is also used for individuals with acute infections or digestive problems, to replace fluids lost by vomiting and diarrhea. The two major types of liquid diets include - Clear liquid diet and full liquid or fluid diet. i) A clear liquid diet includes foods and fluids that are clear and liquid at room temperature. The main purpose of the clear liquid diet is to provide fluids and electrolytes to prevent dehydration. It provides a considerable amount of energy but very little amount of other nutrients. It is also deficient in roughage and fibre. Hence it is nutritionally inadequate and should only be used for short periods i.e. 1-2 days. Examples of clear liquid diet: Water, strained fruit juices, coconut water, lime juice (nimbu pani), whey water, barley/arrowroot water, rice kanji, FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 11clear dal soup, strained vegetable or meat soup, tea or coffee without milk or cream are some examples of a clear liquid diet. ii) A full liquid diet includes food and fluids that are liquid or semi-liquid at room temperature. It is a step between a clear liquid diet and a regular diet. The purpose of the full liquid diet is to provide an oral source of fluid for individuals who are incapable of chewing, swallowing or digesting solid food. It provides more calories than the clear liquid diet and also gives adequate nourishment, except that it is deficient in fibre. It is prescribed for post-operative patients and gastrointestinal illness. The nutritive content of the full liquid diet can be increased by using protein, vitamin and fibre supplements. Examples of full liquid diet: Cream soups, vegetable soups, daal soups, strained food juices, lassi/butter milk, yogurt, hot cocoa, coffee/tea with milk,cereal porridges (refined cereals) custard, sherbet, gelatin, puddings, ice cream, cream (added to foods), poached, half boiled egg etc. b) Soft diet as the name suggests includes soft whole food that is lightly seasoned and is similar to the regular diet. The term 'soft' refers to the fact that foods included in this type of diet are soft in consistency, easy to chew and made of simple and easily digestible foods. It does not contain any harsh fibre or strong flavors. It is given during acute infections, certain gastrointestinal disorders and at the post-operative stage to individuals who are in the early phases of recovery following surgery. The soft diet provides a transition between a liquid and a normal diet i.e. during the period when a patient has to give up a full liquid diet but is yet not able to digest a normal diet. Soft diet can be nutritionally balanced (providing approximately 1800-2000 calories, 55-65g protein) provided the patient can consume adequate amount of food. Examples of soft diet: A soft diet freely permits the use of boiled vegetables, soft raw fruits without seeds, broths and all soups, cooked pulses in the form of soups and the combination of cereals and vegetables (like khichri, dalia), bread and ready-to-eat cereals (such as poha, upma, pasta, etc.), milk and milk beverages, yogurt, light desserts (including kheer, halwa, custard, jelly, ice cream), Egg and tender and minced, ground, stewed meat and meat products, fat like butter, cream, vegetable oil and salt and sugar in moderation. Foods to be best avoided in the soft diet include coarse cereals, spicy, highly seasoned fried foods, dry fruits and nuts, rich desserts.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS12c) Bland Diet: A bland diet is made of foods that are soft, not very spicy and low in fiber. It consists of foods that are mechanically, chemically and thermally non-irritating i.e. are least likely to inflame the gastrointestinal tract. Individuals suffering from gastric or duodenal ulcers, gastritis, or ulcerative colitis are prescribed this diet. Foods Included: Milk and milk products that are low in fat or fat-free; Bread, pasta made from refined cereals, rice; Cooked fruits and vegetables without peel and seeds; Eggs and lean tender meat such as fish, poultry that are steamed, baked or grilled; Cream, butter; Puddings and custards, clear soups. Foods Avoided: fatty strong-flavore foods; coffee, alcoholic beverages, and spices; High fiber foods; Hot soups and beverages; whole grains rich in fiber; strong cheeses. B. Modification in Quantity Depending on the clinical condition some individuals may require a restricted diet such as sodium-restricted diet (as in high blood pressure), purine restricted diet (as in gout) or low residue diet (prescribed and/or before abdominal surgery) designed to reduce the frequency and volume of fecal output. Sometimes a complete elimination diet may be recommended when an individual experiences food intolerances or complete insensitivity to a particular food such as a gluten-free diet or a dairy-free diet or nut-free diet etc. Occasionally an increase in the amount of a specific dietary constituent may be prescribed such as a high potassium diet or a high roughage and fibre diet (as in constipation) or an iron-rich diet (as in anemia) according to the clinical condition. C. Modification in Nutrient (Protein, Fat, Carbohydrate) Content: The nutrient content of the diet is modified to treat deficiencies, change body weight or control certain diseases such as hypertension or diabetes. You may have come across patients with high blood sugar levels, being prescribed a diabetic diet which requires changes in the amount and type of carbohydrates included in each meal. Refined carbohydrates (such as sugar, honey, refined flour, semolina etc.) are avoided and the use of complex carbohydrates (whole wheat flour, coarse cereals etc.) is recommended. Patients with heart diseases require a fat controlled low cholesterol diet while patients with renal (kidney) failure and advanced liver diseases require a low protein FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 13diet, patients with HIV disease, cancer or malnourished a high protein and high calorie diet. Others as in the case of overweight, obesity a weight reduction diet, low in fat and calories is recommended. D. Changes in Meal Frequency Individuals suffering from gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) are benefitted from consuming small but frequent meals. 5 to 6 small meals instead of three regular meals are recommended. E. Changes in Method of Cooking Leaching is recommended for cooking vegetables for people with chronic kidney diseases because the kidney no longer maintains the ideal level of potassium necessary for optimum health. Leaching (soaking in water) drains out excessive potassium and phosphorous from the vegetables. In elderly people food may be modified by mechanical processing such as mashing, blending or chopping. For patients on bland diet foods steamed, baked or grilled are recommended. F. Modification in the Method of Feeding To provide adequate nutrition, normally oral feeding (by mouth) is recommended. Sometimes oral feeding is not possible, under such circumstances special feeding methods such as enteral feeding (provision of liquid formula diet delivered via nasogastric feeding tube) and parenteral feeding (fluids containing water, glucose, amino acids, minerals, vitamins given through the peripheral and central veins) is recommended.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS14EXERCISES Q-1 Define the following: a) Test diet b) Balanced diet c) Liquid diet d) Soft diet e) Bland diet Q-2 Draw a flow chart to depict the classification of hospital diet.

Q-5 List the adaptations required to meet the therapeutic needs of a patient.FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 15The role of nutrition in disease prevention and health management is very well established. Also, you are aware that poor nutrition can directly lead to ill health, disease and infections. Infections are caused by microorganisms which in turn can lead to malnutrition. Is there a link between these two conditions? In this chapter, we shall discuss the interaction of infection and nutrition. Infection and malnutrition have always been closely linked. Evidence suggests that common childhood infections impose their influence in precipitating malnutrition. The relationship between malnutrition, impaired immunity and infection can be described as a vicious cycle. The cycle of malnutrition and infection Malnutrition, as you already know, is an impairment of health resulting from a deficiency or lack of food/nutrients or an imbalance of nutrients in the diet. Almost any nutrient deficiency, if sufficiently severe, will diminish resistance to infection. Let us understand this interaction between malnutrition and infection with the help of a case study. Raju, a 4-year-old boy, is suffering from infectious diarrhea, caused by the invasion of harmful microorganisms in the body. The infection caused loose motion, fever, dehydration and impaired absorption. On further investigation, he was also diagnosed to be suffering from protein-energy malnutrition reflecting as loss of weight. Now, when these two diseases exist in the same person (here Raju) concurrently, the interaction between the two diseases usually alters the nature and behavior of the diseases. The overall clinical status of the child worsens often resulting in increased complications or increased duration of the disease and in severe cases results in death. In case of Raju, infection is a common precipitating factor for malnutrition. Ironically, UNIT - 01 Chapter 03 NUTRITION AND INFECTION Learning Objectives : After reading this chapter, the students will be able to: 1. Understand the interaction between nutrition and infection. 2. Explain the effect of infection on nutritional status. 3. Discuss how malnutrition can lead to infection.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS16malnutrition is also one of the major factor in the occurrence of infection and the two interact, making each other worse. Figure 3.1 illustrates this interaction. Figure 3.1: Interaction between infection and malnutrition An inadequate dietary intake, in the case of Raju, led to weight loss, lowered immunity, mucosal injury, invasion by pathogens, and impaired growth and development as illustrated in Figure 3.1. Raju's nutrition was further aggravated by diarrhea, malabsorption, loss of appetite, deprivation of nutrients for the immune response, and urinary nitrogen loss, all of which lead to nutrient losses and further damage to defense mechanisms making him more vulnerable to infections. This in turn led to further reduced dietary intake causing a vicious cycle of malnutrition and infection as highlighted in Figure 3.2. So, infection aggravates malnutrition or malnutrition lowers resistance to infection, the relationship between the two can be described as Synergism i.e. the simultaneous presence of malnutrition and infection results in an interaction that is more serious for the individual than would be expected from the combined effect of the two working independently.FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 17 Figure 3.2: The Vicious Cycle of Malnutrition and Infection The synergistic effect of malnutrition and infection often leads to a high rate of child deaths in poor communities in India. What generally happens is that in a poor rural/ slum household a child is as such born with low birth weight (that is less than 2.5kg) because of inadequate dietary intake of the mother during pregnancy. Subsequently, the child is exclusively breastfed for long periods (2 or more years). Complementary feeding (i.e. introduction of additional foods other than breastmilk) is delayed beyond 6 months of age. This triggers growth faltering that is the child's growth and development slows down resulting in weight loss. In other terms malnutrition sets in. Moreover, in view of the poor environment and lack of hygiene , the children are further exposed to infections like diarrhea and respiratory tract infections. There is reduction in food intake by the child due to loss of appetite as a result of these infections. The cumulative effect of dietary deficit and infection produces retardation of physical growth leading to stunting (short stature or low height/length for age as compared to normal child) in children. It is important to highlight here that the effects of stunting are long lasting. Children who are stunted, grow up to be adults with reduced capacity to do any physical work and are less economically productive.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS18Effect of Malnutrition on Infection With reference to Figures 3.1 and 3.2, it must be evident to you that inadequate nutrient intake lowers immunity. Also, it leads to mucosal damage. Let us get to know more on this aspect. a) Lowered Immunity: Immunity can be described as the state of being unsusceptible or being protected against a disease or illness by the presence of a particular substance in the blood. These particular disease fighting substances are called antibodies. A healthy well-nourished child/individual is at a lower risk of infection. They can fight the infection because of the ability of these well-nourished individuals to produce these disease fighting substances called antibodies. But in the case of malnourished individuals there is a reduction in antibody production and therefore the disease fighting capacity is lowered making the individual more vulnerable to infections. b) Effect on the integrity of skin and mucous membrane: Dietary inadequacy diminishes resistance towards infection by reducing the integrity of various tissues. In a healthy well nourished individual the skin, mucosal membrane and other tissues are healthy and prevent the entry of infectious agents. They act as a barrier and prevent infections from entering the body. In an individual suffering from malnutrition, the protective mechanism is absent. The mucous membrane becomes readily permeable and provides a favorable environment for the growth of the infectious agent. Consequently, the individual catches infection easily. Infection and Nutritional Status Infection, no matter how mild, has adverse effects on nutritional status. Nutritional status refers to the condition of health of an individual as influenced by the utilization of the nutrients. So how does infection influence the utilization of the nutrients which in turn influences nutritional status? Let us understand. There can be multiple ways but the first and foremost effect of infection is on the loss of appetite. a) Loss of Appetite: Do you recall the last time you were sick or down with some infection? What did you experience? Yes, you may not have been eager to consume food or were not able to tolerate food leading to loss of appetite. Further with the use of medicines such as antibiotics to treat the infection your appetite may have been affected leading to reduced food intake. Now if this condition would have been prolonged it would have led to consistent decrease in the amount of food intake leading to nutrient deficiency.FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 19b) Unfavorable cultural practices: One of the most common practices in our country is to restrict or withdraw food from individuals while suffering from infection, particularly diarrhea or respiratory infections. It is believed that solid foods, milk etc. be best avoided instead of bland, starchy gruels low in nutritive value being provided to rest the digestive system. Such a practice is deleterious and harmful; particularly when the individual due to infection is already having low food intake. Further reduction in the quality of diet contributes to nutrient deficiencies and thus leads to poor nutritional status. Decreased intestinal absorption: The main function of intestine is to digest, absorb and propel food along its length. During the course of infection all these functions are affected. Infections cause changes to the epithelial membrane leading to malabsorption. Any decrease in the absorption of nutrients can further lead to deficiency. For example, in children suffering from infectious diarrhea, protein absorption from the intestine may reduce as much as 40%. Other evidence suggests that in children with acute diarrhea and respiratory infections only 30 -70 percent of ingested vitamin A is absorbed. Poor absorption thus leads to nutrient deficiency disorders influencing nutritional status. c) Worm/parasite infection: Also there are documented reports implicating intestinal worm/parasitic infections with poor nutritional status. Hookworm, round worm infection, amoebiasis, giardiasis is among the most common intestinal parasitic infections worldwide. These infections are associated with decreased child growth, loss of weight, chronic blood loss, iron deficiency leading to anemia, diarrhea and stunted growth. d) Protein loss: In some infections and fevers, few nutrients, particularly proteins are excreted and lost from the body thus causing its deficiency. For example, diseases associated with diarrhea, dysentery produce an average loss of 0.9g protein per kg body weight per day. Higher losses are observed with typhoid fever and other acute infections, reaching 1.2g protein/kg body weight/day. Such losses therefore, contribute to the increased requirement of protein-rich food during infection and fevers. From the discussion above it must be evident to you that the overall effect of the infections on the nutritional status is substantial. In the context of a developing countries like India, where a large number of children, are already on a deficient diet and malnourished, the coexistence of infection in the same child is producing an effect that is beyond the summed effect expected from the two conditions acting alone.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS20EXERCISES Q-1 Differentiate between malnutrition and nutrition.

Q-5 What are the consequences of worm/parasite infection on children?FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 21Many food items are consumed as such in the raw state while few are cooked to make them edible. Food is being cooked as it tastes better. Even vegetables and fruits are cooked to add variety to the diet and make them easily palatable, attractive and colorful. Cooking also kills many microorganisms and makes the food safe to be consumed. Several raw food items also have anti-nutritional factors which are destroyed by cooking. It also enhances the availability of some nutrients. Figure 4.1: Different Methods of CookingUNIT - 01 Chapter 04 METHODS OF COOKING Learning Objectives : After reading this chapter, the students will be able to: 1. Describe various methods of cooking. 2. Explain and ensure the nutritive values in different methods of cooking.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS22Principles of cooking food 1. Food must be cooked in a manner that retains the original flavors. 2. Sometimes the flavor of the food is drawn out into the gravy or broth. 3. The preservation of the maximum nutritive value can be ensured by using the correct process of cooking. Cooking methods During cooking, heat may be transferred to the food by conduction, convection, radiation or by the energy of microwave-electronic heat transfer. Moist Method Dry heat Combination Method Boiling Roasting Braising Simmering Grilling/ Broiling Poaching Toasting Stewing Baking Blenching Suffering Steaming Frying Pressure Cooking Table 4.2: Classification of Cooking Methods Moist Methods: In this method, the heat generated by water in some form or the other is used for cooking. Some of the important ones are explained below: a) Boiling Food items are cooked by placing them in boiling water at 100\u00b0C and this temperature is maintained till the desired stage of cooking has been reached. Rice, pulses, potatoes are cooked this way. Advantages 1. It is the simplest method of cooking. 2. Boiling of food brings about uniform cooking. 3. At high temperatures, protein content of food get denatured and embedded in foodFOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 23 4. Starch gets gelatinized and collagen gets hydrolyzed. 5. Boiling of food also aids in proper digestion Disadvantages 1. The process of boiling takes more time. 2. When an excess water is used the water-soluble nutrients are lost. 3. Loss of minerals is also a big disadvantage with the boiling method. 4. Boiling of food brings about its decoloration. b) Pressure Cooking In this method, the food is cooked under pressure and with the increase in pressure the temperature also correspondingly increases. Thus the food is cooked relatively fast. Pressure cooking is a type of steaming only in which water is boiled under high pressure, thus, raising the temperature and reducing the cooking time. Advantages 1. Reduces cooking time. 2. Fuel efficiency increases. 3. Nutrient loss is relatively less. 4. Food is cooked properly and is made tender. 5. The flavor and aroma of the food are retained inside the cooker and is not lost. Disadvantages 1. Long hours of pressure cooking make food soggy and too soft. 2. Flavors of food may blend and individuality is lost. c) Steaming This method uses steam as the mode of cooking. The food is surrounded by steam and is cooked by the heat supplied from steam. Types of steaming are: Dry steaming: The steam generated from a double boiler is used for cooking food. Sauces and custards are made by this method. Wet Steaming: Steam comes in direct contact with the food and cooks it. Dhokla and idli are made by this method.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS24 Ad vantages 1. Constant stirring is not required. 2. Nutritive value of the food remains intact. 3. Cooking time is less. 4. Makes the food easily digestible. 5. The flavor of the steamed food is good. Disadvantages 1. Dhokla cooker and Idli makers are required. 2. Special vessels are essential for steaming food. 3. Only a few food items can be cooked by this method. d) Poaching This method is generally used for cooking eggs. This involves cooking in the minimum amount of liquid at a temperature of 80-85\u00b0C. Fish and fruits are also poached. Advantages 1. Cooks food quickly. 2. There is no addition of fat. 3. The foods that are poached are easily digestible. Disadvantages 1. Water-soluble nutrients leach into the water. 2. The food items are generally bland in taste. e) Toasting Generally used for bread slices which are browned from both sides by keeping them between two grilles. Advantages 1. Improves color, flavor and texture of food. 2. Roasted seeds are easy to grind. 3. Roasting reduces the amount of moisture of foodsFOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 25 Disadvantages 1. A continuous vigil is require d to prevent burning. 2. Amino acids are lost while toasting. f) Baking The medium of cooking is hot air. A dry method of cooking, it combines steam which is generated while food is cooked. Cakes, custard, baked vegetables, bread, biscuit, pizzas are all baked food. Advantages 1. Texture and flavor of food are improved. 2. Baking gives rise to a variety of combinations of dishes. 3. Food items are cooked uniformly in an oven. Disadvantages 1. An oven is required for baking. 2. Over cooking results in the burning and scorching of food. g) Blanching Blanching is a cooking process wherein a food, usually a vegetable or fruit, is scalded in boiling water or oil, and removed after a brief, timed interval. Finally plunged into iced water or placed under cold running water (shocking or refreshing) to halt the cooking process. Advantages 1. Blanched dishes are healthy as there is minimal loss of nutrients because of the short cooking time. 2. Blanching enhances the color of green vegetables, and the time taken is also lesser than other moist heat cooking methods. Disadvantages 1. Blanching can be used only for limited food items. 2. Blanching often needs to be coupled with another cooking process so as to provide more flavor to the final dish.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS26EXERCISES Q-1 Why is it important to cook the food before eating?

You would realize that infection and fever coexist. Fever is a result of infection. In this section, we will also look at the basic concepts and correlation between fever, infection and nutrition. A detailed review on dietary management of fevers will be discussed. Fever: Definition, Causes & Symptoms Fever is classically described as the abnormal condition of the body, characterized by an excessive rise in body temperature, quickening of the pulse, and disturbance of various body functions. Surely, you must be aware of the normal body temperature. The normal human body temperature may range from 36\u00b0C to 37\u00b0C (98.6F). So, technically any body temperature above the normal temperature may be considered fever. What do you think? Well, in practice an individual is usually not considered to have a significant fever until the temperature is above 100.4 (38\u00b0C). It is important to understand that fever is not a disease but is a symptom or an adaptive response of our body to a variety of conditions, such as inflammation, infection or any unknown cause. Fever may be caused due to any bacterial infection or by a virus or certain inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis - inflammation of the lining of your joints or heat exhaustion etc. As a child, you may recall suffering from cough/cold or diarrhea and/or chest infection, and very often these infections were accompanied by fever. The clinical and behavioral manifestations of fever besides raised temperature you might have UNIT - 02 Chapter 05 FEVERS (ACUTE & CHRONIC) (TYPES, CAUSES, CLINICAL SYMPTOMS AND DIETARY MANAGEMENT) Learning Objectives : After reading this chapter, the students will be able to: 1. Define the term fever and present the classification of fevers. 2. Differentiate between acute and chronic fevers. 3. Explain the causes, clinical symptoms and the metabolic changes during infection and fevers. 4. Describe diet therapy during fevers.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS30experienced included headache, chills and shivering, muscle ache, sweating, loss of appetite, irritability, dehydration, general weakness etc. Fever is, therefore, a sign that something out of the ordinary is going on in the body. Fever, in fact, is part of the body's own disease-fighting mechanism. One of the ways our immune system attempts to combat infection is, rise in body temperature. Fever helps to defend against microbial (bacterial/viral) invasions and apparently is capable of killing or inhibiting the growth of some bacteria/viruses that can tolerate only a slender temperature range. From our review so far, we may then conclude that usually, a rise in temperature helps the individual overcome an infection. So, a mild fever i.e., above the normal body temperature but below 100.4\u00b0F (38\u00b0C) is probably helping to neutralize the bacteria or virus that is causing the infection. There is no need to worry. But sometimes fever may rise too high and can be severe and serious and lead to complications. Therefore, it is important to learn about the type, classification and pattern of fever for appropriate management. Fever: Classification and Types Fevers are primarily classified into three categories: Acute, Sub-acute and Chronic fevers based on duration as highlighted in Figure 5. Figure 5: Classification of FeversFOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 31Acute fevers are those which stay in the body for less than 1 week and are characteristics of infectious diseases such as malaria and viral-related upper respiratory tract infections. Sub-acute fevers usually stay in the body for not more than 2 weeks as can be seen in cases of typhoid fever. Chronic fever on the other hand is persistent, it usually stays in the body for more than 2 weeks. Basal Metabolic Rate is described as the rate at which our body uses energy when we are resting in order to keep the vital body functions (such as heart beating, breathing etc.) going and are typical of chronic bacterial infections such as viral infections like HIV , cancers tuberculosis, etc. Based on the height of the body temperature, fevers can be further classified as low- grade, moderate- grade or high-grade fever. You would observe that a low-grade fever does not go beyond 37.8\u00b0C and is present daily, especially during the evening. Tuberculosis leads to low-grade fever. Similarly, you may come across fever types described as sustained or continuous fever, intermittent fever and remittent fever. Sustained/continuous fever is described as a fever that does not vary more than about 1\u00b0C (1.5 \u00b0F) during 24 hours but at no time touched normal. Continuous fevers are seen in typhoid, pneumonia and urinary tract infection among others. Such fevers are characterized by slow step-wise temperature rise. Intermittent fever is defined as fever present only for several hours during the day. This pattern you may notice in tuberculosis, malaria or pyrogenic infections. Remittent fever, on the other hand, is defined as fever with daily fluctuations exceeding 2\u00b0C but at no time touched normal. This kind of fever is always associated with infectious diseases such as rickettsia infection, infective endocarditis. Looking at the different types and classifications of fever, we shall focus next on fever management, with special reference to dietary management. Diet, you would observe plays an important role in fever management. As the body temperature rises above normal, several metabolic changes occur in the body that increases the nutritional needs. A brief review of these changes is discussed further. Metabolic Changes during Fever Usually, fever is characterized by certain metabolic changes. Higher the temperature, longer the duration of the fever, more is the ill effect. The common effects include: Increase in the basal metabolic rate (BMR). Note, there is a 13% increase in BMR with every 1\u00b0C rise in body temperature. (or 7% increase with every 1\u00b0C increase in temperature).CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS32 Decreased stores of adipose (fat) tissue and decreased glycogen stores. Increased catabolism (breakdown) of proteins, especially in case of malaria, typhoid, tuberculosis fevers. This leads to the production of an excess amount of nitrogenous wastes, which lays additional stress on the kidneys. Increased excretion of potassium, sodium, chloride etc. through sweat, urine, vomiting leads to electrolyte imbalance. Accelerated loss of fluid from the body in the form of excessive sweat and urine formation. Loss of appetite limits the food intake thus leading to weight loss. Decrease in the absorption of nutrients like vitamins, minerals, proteins. The above changes accompanied by muscle ache, headache, chills and shivering, sweating, loss of appetite, general weakness, irritability, dehydration experienced during fever may have a serious effect on the nutritional status of the individual. Thus, fever management becomes critical. In the next section, we shall look at diet therapy for fever management. We shall first consider the dietary management in sub-acute fever, followed by dietary management for chronic fever. Dietary Management of Sub-Acute Fever Typhoid is a serious health threat in the developing countries such as India, especially for children. We have already learnt that typhoid is a sub-acute continuous fever that can last for about 14 days. Typhoid is caused by the Salmonella typhi bacteria and is also called enteric fever as the bacteria or infection is found in the intestines. Typhoid fever spreads through contaminated food and water or occasionally through direct contact with someone who is infected. The mode of spread of this infection is through the faecal-oral route. Let us understand the concept of the faecal-oral route here. Note, Salmonella typhi is passed in the faeces and sometimes in the urine of infected people. The source of infection can be the drinking water or milk or any other food contaminated by intestinal contents (through faeces, urine) of the patient or by flies that transmit the disease. We can also contact the infection if we eat food handled by someone with typhoid fever who has not washed their hands carefully after using the toilet.FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 33A patient with typhoid will usually suffer: High fever, headache, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting. Gastrointestinal problems like abdominal pain and either diarrhea or constipation. Increased BMR. Massive loss of lean body mass (muscle) due to tissue (protein) breakdown leads to excessive nitrogen loss. Significant decrease in adipose and glycogen tissue stores because of increased energy expenditure. Excessive diarrhea, vomiting leads to fluid and electrolyte losses. Dietary management in Sub-acute fever The main objective of dietary management during sub-acute fever is to: i) provide a nutritious diet to prevent malnutrition, ii) restore positive nitrogen balance and reduce the burden on kidneys, iii) provide relief to symptoms as and when present, iv) correct and maintain water and electrolyte balance, v) avoid irritation of intestinal tract as may occur in typhoid. Thus, the dietary management will focus on providing a diet that contains proteins, high calories, carbohydrates and moderate fat. But, very often the fever is accompanied by vomiting, anorexia, nausea. You would observe that the patient has poor appetite and moreover is unable to intake food. So, the diet has to be modified as per the patients' tolerance. The food textures given would depend on the patient's tolerance. Initially, a liquid or full fluid diet may be provided for few days. As the person's appetite improves a bland diet, low fibre soft diet may be given which is easy to digest and soothing. Slowly the person may be asked to take normal diet. The main idea is to encourage the patient to eat properly so as to meet the increased nutrient requirements. Feeding several times a day needs to be encouraged. The nutrient needs during typhoid and how to meet them is the focus of the discussion next. The information is summarized in Table 5.1.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS341600 Kcal Diet Chart Meal Menu Amount Early Morning Coconut water (Liquid and electrolytes) Glucose biscuit1 glass (250ml) 2 No. Breakfast Potato sandwich with butter (high calorie) Banana Pasteurized skin milk1 portion (2 slices) 1 No. (250ml) 10.00am Buttermilk Suji upma1 glass (250ml) 1 bowl cooked Mid Morning (12:00 noon) Clear dal soup 1 big bowl (200ml) Lunch Khichri Soft Vegetable (Lauki/ Tinda/ Pumpkin/potato) Washed dal Curd Cooking oil1 big bowl 1 bowl cooked 1 bowl cooked 1 bowl 1 - 1\u00bd tsp Evening tea Tea with sugar Glucose Biscuit1 cup with 2 tsp 2 No. Evening Snack Lemon Water (sugar and salt) Stewed apple1 glass 1 bowl cooked Dinner Boiled Rice Soft Vegetable (Lauki/ Tinda/ pumpkin/ potato) Washed dal Curd Cooking Oil1 big bowl 1 bowl cooked 1 bowl cooked 1 bowl 1 1\u00bd tsp Bed time Apple Juice 1 glass (250 ml) Table 5.1: Dietary Considerations and Nutritional Needs During Sub-acute Fever. Following the dietary considerations highlighted in Table 5.1, we hope you should be in a position to plan a diet for a typhoid patient.FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 35Do's and Don'ts, and a list of what food items to give and which type of food to avoid are highlighted herewith. You may consult the list while planning the diet. Food Itmes to Include Food Items to Avoid 1.Plenty of fluids like juices, soups, coconut water, electrolyte, barley water, soups.1.High fibre foods like whole-grain cereals and their products e.g. whole wheat flour, whole wheat bread, oats and cracked wheat, whole pulses and pulses with husk. 2.Milk and milk based beverages. 2.All raw vegetables and fruits with hard skin or fibre such as green leafy vegetables. 3.Bland, well cooked, well mashed, sieved, soft, semisolid food like khichdi, rice with curd, suji custard etc.3.Strongly flavoured vegetables like cabbage, capsicum, turnip, raddish, onion and garlic as they cause gas, bloating. 4.Low fibre food such as refined cereals and their products (e.g. maida, rava, bread, rice, noodles etc.) dehusked pulses (washed dals), well cooked/stewed fruits, vegetables in soft and puree form and potatoes.4.Thick creamy soups 5.Food providing proteins of high biologic value e.g. eggs, soft cheeses, tender meats, fish, poultry etc.5.Fried fatty food such as samosas, gelatin-based desserts, sugars, honey,candy and jam.6.Sweet concentrated food using excessive whole milk and dairy fat including halwas, ladoos, pastries, desserts etc. 7. Acidic and spicy food such as pickles, relishes, chutneys, sauces, vinegar as they may irritate the intestine. 8. Spices, condiments and seasonings like pepper, cayenne and chilli powder to ensure that the digestive tract does not inflame all the more. Table 5.2: Food Items to Include and Food Items to Avoid in the Diet of the Typhoid Patient In addition to the list provided in Table 5.2, some do's and don'ts basic tips are presented in Table 5.3.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS36Do's Don'ts 1. Always wash vegetables, fruits with clean water before eating.1. Avoid places that do not maintain hygiene, avoid foods from street vendors. 2. Wash hands frequently, particularly before eating or preparing food and after using the toilet.2. Don't buy open and cut fruits and vegetables from street vendors. 3. Drink water that has been boiled, filtered and treated.3. Do not eat unwashed or unpeeled fruits and vegetables. 4. Consume 3-5 liters of fluids in a day in the form of water, fruit juices, tender coconut water and soup.4. Avoid eating large meals to prevent discomfort. 5. Eat small frequent meals. 5. Avoid excessive use of fats in cooking. 6. Make sure the food is thoroughly cooked and served steaming hot.6. Avoid eating food at room temperature. 7. Avoid unpasteurised dairy products. 8. Avoid using ice made from tap or well water. 9. Avoid close contact or sharing eating utensils, cups with people who are infected. Table 5.3: Do's and Don'ts Dietary Management of Chronic Fever Tuberculosis (TB), is an example of chronic fever which is caused by the bacteria- Mycobacterium tuberculosis . The disease is spread from person to person through microscopic droplets which are released into the air by cough or spit or sneeze from a person suffering from tuberculosis. Tuberculosis mainly affects the lungs but can spread to other organs also, like lymph nodes, kidneys, bones etc. In India, it is observed that pulmonary tuberculosis occurs most commonly. It is worthy to note that tuberculosis remains a major global health problem and is one of FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 37the top 10 causes of death and the leading cause from a single infectious agent. It is linked to poverty, undernutrition, and poor immune function. Latent tuberculosis is when a person is infected with pulmonary tuberculosis. In a normal healthy individual, the immune system helps fight the infection and the bacteria in the body are in an inactive state and the person shows no symptom. However, if the body's immune system is unable to fight the bacteria the disease becomes active and is contagious and can spread in the body and to other people. There is a long-term association between tuberculosis and undernutrition. TB makes undernutrition worse and undernutrition weakens immunity, thereby increasing the likelihood that latent TB will develop into active disease. The common symptom with active TB in individuals is that they: are in a catabolic (breakdown of body/protein tissue) state leading to muscle wasting, experience loss of appetite leading to weight loss, fever, fatigue, exhaustion and persistent coughing, show signs of vitamin and mineral deficiencies, and low body mass index (BMI) (lower than 18.5 kg/m2). Why do you think weight loss occurs among those suffering from TB? Weight loss can be caused by several factors, including: reduced food intake due to loss of appetite, nausea and abdominal pain, loss of protein and other nutritional reserves due to fever, malabsorption due to diarrhea, loss of fluids, electrolytes, metabolic alterations caused by the disease, and an increase in the energy expenditure of the patient in an attempt to fight infection. The progression of the disease may be slow and gradual but it can have serious consequences. The key to treatment, therefore, is early detection, followed by antibiotic therapy, adequate rest and dietary management. Children suffering from TB, in particular, need special attention since the child has increased requirements as a result of both growth and TB. Tuberculosis can be completely cured through CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS38short-course chemotherapy. Treating TB cases who are sputum-smear positive (and who can therefore spread the disease to others) at the source, is the most effective means of eliminating TB from a population. DOTS or Directly Observed Treatment Short course is the internationally recommended strategy for TB control that has been recognized as a highly efficient and cost-effective strategy. Let us study abo ut the dietary management next. Dietary Management of Tuberculosis As undernutrition is highly prevalent among people suffering from TB, the dietary recommendations for TB patients are based on the nutrient and energy requirements for hyper-catabolic and malnourished patients. The main objective of diet therapy is to avoid weight loss, strengthen the immune system and accelerate recovery. A suitable diet containing all the vital nutrients namely carbohydrates, fats, proteins, minerals and vitamins is required for the well-being and health of a person suf fering from TB. Dietary Considerations for Tuberculosis Here are some dietary recommendations on how to monitor weight gain in TB patients, particularly in children: Encourage the individual to take a healthy, nourishing balanced diet. TB often harmfully affects the nutritional intake due to poor appetite, making patients at risk for malnutrition. Encourage patients to consume six smaller meals per day instead of three. Make the meals appetizing in appearance and taste and provide enough energy and protein. Commercially-available high energy and protein drinks (balanced in terms of micro- and macronutrients) may be used effectively to meet the increased requirements. Household ingredients such as vegetable oil, sugar, peanut butter, eggs and non- fat dry milk powder can be used in porridge, soups, milk based-drinks and gravies to increase the protein and energy content without adding to the bulk of the meal. At least 500ml to 1litre milk (or milk products like yoghurt, soft cheese) should be consumed daily to ensure suitable intakes of vitamin D and calcium. Ensure consumption of at least five to six portions of fruit and vegetables per day. Pure fruit juice can be used to decrease the bulk of the diet.FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 39 Provide adequate fluid intake (at least 10 to 12 glasses per day) to compensate for increased losses. Provide a good multivitamin and mineral supplement. Ensure safe food handling and personal hygiene. Now, you can summarize the dietary recommendation for a TB patient. Prepare a list of food items you may include liberally or restrict/avoid in the diet of a TB patient. Do's Don'ts 1. Cereals and millets (wheat, rice, ragi, jowar)1. Red meat and organ meats 2. Pulses (rajma, black chana, soyabean)2. Limit refined foods 3. High energy, protein drinks and beverages3. Strongly flavored vegetables 4. Foods providing proteins of high biologic values ex.- eggs, soft cheese, tender meat, fish etc.4. Excess fat 5. Cereals pulse combination with some animal protein ex. Khichri with curd etc.5. Fried fatty food 6. Nuts and oil seeds like pea nuts 6. Sweets concentrated food 7. Seasonal fruits and vegetables 7. Acidic and spicy food such as pickles 8. Green leafy vegetables like maithi, mint, spinach, cabbage etc.8. Spices, condiments and seasoning 9. Citrus fruits 10. Milk and milk products 11. Vegetable oils and dairy fat like ghee 12. Jaggary and sugar We end the dietary management of TB patients with some Do's and Don'ts.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS40Do's Don'ts 1.

Diarrhea is an infection and an important public health problem among children under the age of 5 years in most developing countries. Recent studies suggest that diarrhea is the third leading cause of childhood mortality in India, and is responsible for 13% of all deaths/among children under the age of five years. This chapter will focus on the classification/ terminologies, determinants, strategies to prevent and control of diarrhea and dietary recommendations for the management of diarrhea at home or in a community setting. Diarrhea: Definition, Causes & Symptoms As per the World Health Organization (WHO), diarrhea is defined as the passage of three or more loose or liquid stools per day (or more frequent passage than normal for the individual). Now consider the following cases: Case 1: Rani is a 2-year-old girl. She has a history of frequent passing of stools but they are well-formed. As a baby who was breastfed, even then, Rani use to pass loose \"pasty\" (semi-formed) stools. Her mother is worried. Case 2: Ramu is a 2-year-old boy. He has a 2-day history of watery Diarrhea. His mother informs that he has had several episodes of loose motions with 4-5 loose liquid stools passed per day.UNIT - 02 Chapter 06 Diarrhea (TYPES, CAUSES, CLINICAL SYMPTOMS AND DIETARY MANAGEMENT) Learning Objectives : After reading this chapter, the students will be able to: 1. Explain the term Diarrhea and review the different terminologies used in the context of Diarrhea. 2. Discuss and differentiate between different types of Diarrhea. 3. Explain the causes, clinical symptoms and the metabolic changes during Diarrhea. 4. Describe the dietary recommendations during Diarrhea.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS42In your opinion are the two children suffering from Diarrhea? Before you draw any conclusion, please go through the definition of diarrhea once again more carefully. Then comment on each case. Diarrhea is the passage of three or more liquid or watery stools in a day. Here the consistency and character of stools rather than the number of stools alone is critical. Figure 6: Types of Diarrhea Now, considering the two cases mentioned above, Ramu is more likely to be suffering from Diarrhea as he is having frequent watery stools. Rani, though was passing frequent stools but the stools were well-formed. Hence, she is not likely to be suffering from Diarrhea. Remember, Diarrhea is characterized by the frequent passage of watery stools, which is accompanied by excessive loss of fluids and electrolytes, especially sodium and potassium. Diarrhea, is a symptom and not a disease. This must be clear to you. SYMPTOMS OF DIARRHEA Diarrhea is associated with symptoms depending on the cause and who is af fected. Common symptoms, however, include: Watery, thin or loose stools Abdominal cramps Sense of urgency to have a bowel movement Nausea and vomiting In addition to the symptoms described above, the symptoms of severe persistent diarrhea include: Dehydration Blood, mucus, or undigested food in the stoolFOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 43 Weight loss Fever Diarrhea can be life-threatening! If a person is suffering from diarrhea, the stools will have high water content - an indicator that water is being lost in higher than normal amounts. The stools also contain a high amount of electrolytes (sodium, potassium). This results in the deficiency of water and electrolytes in the body which is termed as dehydration. By now, you must have understood the consequences of diarrhea/dehydration and can observe that it is the highest cause of illness and death especially, in children. So, an understanding of what causes diarrhea needs urgent attention. CAUSES OF DIARRHEA Diarrhea, is usually considered a symptom of bowel infection. The infection may be caused by a wide range of pathogens, including bacteria, viruses and protozoa. These include: (E. coli), Salmonella and Shigella : all may cause food poisoning. Viruses, such as a Norovirus or Rotavirus. Parasites, such as the Giardia intestinalis , that cause Giardiasis. Infection is spread through contaminated food or water or from person to person as a result of poor hygiene. Poverty, unawareness, poor sanitation is often the underlying risk factors. Diarrhea is caused by the consumption of contaminated food or water while travelling and is often known as the traveller's diarrhea. Recognizing the ill-effects, management of diarrhea, particularly in the context of management of dehydration and malnutrition is crucial which is discussed next. TREATMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF DIARRHEA Diarrhea/dehydration should not be ignored and must receive rapid medical care to minimize the frequency of morbidity and mortalities. In light of the complications discussed above let us now examine what should be the objectives in the management of Diarrhea and more specifically dehydration. The major objectives in the management of diarrhea include: 1. Fluid and electrolyte replacement. 2. Removal of cause (especially if infection). 3. Nutritional concerns.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS444. Determining the status of dehydration. 5. Fluid management (ORT-Oral rehydration therapy). 6. Nutritional management. The first step in diarrhea management is to determine the status of dehydration. Let us consider this Determining the status of Dehydration Dehydration status Sign/Symptoms Some dehydrationTwo of the following signs: Restless, irritable Sunken eyes Drinks eagerly, thirsty Skin pinch goes back Slowly Severe dehydrationTwo of the following signs: Lethargy or unconscious Sunken eyes Not able to drink or drinking poorly Skin pinch goes back very slowly Table 6.1: Recognizing dehydration Figure 6.2a: Sunken eyes - a sign of dehydration FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 45 Figure 6.2b: Skin pinch - goes back slowly A review on the use of ORT and fluid therapy in dehydration management is presented next. The key to the management of Diarrhea is the early replacement of fluid lost in the stools through intravenous or oral route (by mouth). Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT) is the most essential and effective way for the management of diarrhea. A review on the use of ORT and the fluid therapy in the management of dehydration is presented further. First, we need to understand what is ORT? Oral rehydration therapy is a simple treatment for dehydration that is associated with Diarrhea. The term ORT includes: Complete Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS) solution. Solutions made from sugar and salt. Food based solutions. Home fluids without insisting on specified amounts of glucose and salt. The term ORS refers to the complete Oral Rehydration Salt mixture. ORS is potentially the most important medical advance of this century. It is effective, safe and cost saving. It can alone successfully rehydrate 95-97% of individuals suffering from diarrhea. A single universal ORS solution containing: sodium - 75 mmol/l and glucose - 75 mmol/l, osmolarity 245 mosmol/l is recommended for all ages and all types of diarrhea. How much of ORS is to be given for the replacement of ongoing stool losses to maintain hydration. Refer to Table 6.2 for easy reference.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS46Age After each liquid stool, offer < 6 months Quarter glass or cup * (50 ml) 7 months to less than 2 years Quarter to half glass or cup * (50-100 ml) 2 up to 10 years Half to one glass or cup* (100-200 ml) Older children and adults As much as desired * Large tea cup Table 6.2: ORS Guidelines for Replacement of Ongoing Losses to Maintain Hydration Besides ORS, other oral rehydration therapies can also be used and recommended, when ORS is not available.

Adolescents, young adulthood is a period of increased awareness of one's body appearance and having a distorted body image or negative perception about one's body weight and shape during this phase of life can be a potent cause of several unhealthy body- related behaviors and disordered eating patterns. In this chapter, we will focus on these issues. We will learn about eating disorders - the types, causes, consequences and what dietary measures to adopt to manage the disordered eating condition. What are Eating Disorders? Eating disorders are the illnesses in which the people experience severe disturbances in their eating pattern/behaviors and related thoughts and emotions. People suffering from eating disorders typically become pre- occupied with food and their body weight. These disorders can affect a person's physical and mental health. Eating disorders are serious and sometimes fatal and can be life- threatening. Eating disorders include binge eating disorder, bulimia nervosa, and, less common but very serious, anorexia nervosa. These conditions are defined herewith.UNIT - 02 Chapter 07 EATING DISORDERS (DEFINITION, CAUSES, PHYSIOLOGICAL CONDITIONS, DIETARY MANAGEMENT) Learning Objectives : After reading this chapter, the students will be able to: 1. Explain the term eating disorder. 2. Explain and differentiate between different types of eating disorders. 3. Discuss the causes, clinical symptoms, metabolic changes and consequences of eating disorders. 4. Discuss the management of eating disorders with special reference to nutritional management.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS48Binge Eating Disorder Binge eating disorder is characterized by recurring binge (excessive indulgence in eating) episodes during which a person feels a loss of control and marked distress over his or her eating patterns. Three particular features are characteristic of the binge eating disorder. These include: i) the amount of food eaten is larger than most persons would eat under similar circumstances, ii) the excessive eating occurs in a discreet period, usually less than 2 hours, and iii) the eating is accompanied by a subjective sense of loss of control. Bulimia Nervosa Bulimia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by binge eating (eating large amount of food in a short time span, along with the sense of loss of control) followed by a type of behavior that recompenses for the binge, such as purging (including self-induced vomiting), excessive use of laxatives or diuretics, fasting and/or engaging in excessive exercise. People with bulimia can fall within the normal range for their weight. But they often fear gaining weight, want to lose weight desperately, and are intensely unhappy with their body shape and size. Anorexia Nervosa Anorexia Nervosa refers to loss of appetite. Anorexia nervosa, therefore, is a disease that is characterized by a significant and persistent reduction in food intake leading to extremely low body weight in the context of age, sex, and physical health. Feature characteristics of anorexia nervosa include: i) relentless pursuit of thinness, ii) a distortion of body image and a great fear of gaining weight, and iii) extremely disturbed eating behavior. Clinical Characteristics, Sign, Symptoms of Eating Disorders After looking at the different types of eating disorders surely you may be able to differentiate between these specific conditions. To help you recall, you studied that: Unlike bulimia nervosa, in binge eating disorder, binge eating episodes are not followed by purging, fasting or excessive exercise. People suffering from binge eating disorders are often overweight or obese. Unlike anorexia nervosa, people with bulimia can fall within the normal range for their weight. People with anorexia see themselves as overweight, even when they are starved or severely malnourished.FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 49Some common clinical characteristics and signs, symptoms associated with these eating disorders are highlighted in Table 7.1. Surely, they will help you in the diagnosis or further identification of an eating disorder. Anorexia Nervosa Bulimia Nervosa Binge Eating Disorder - Profound Weight loss leads to maintenance of body weight 15 percent below normal.- Frequent fluctuations in weight. An individual is usually rainging from normal weight to overweight.- Food seeking in the absence of hunger (such as after a full meal). - Dieting, deny hunger, even when one is thin or emaciated.- Eating a large amount of food in a short time, along with the sense of loss of control.- Excessive eating, amount of food eaten is large at one time. - An intense fear of weight gain or becoming fat despite the individual's underweight status.- Purging (self-induced vomiting) after meals.- A sense of lack of control over eating. - Excessive or compulsive exercising.- Inability to voluntarily stop eating/feeling guilty or ashamed about eating.- Absence of purging, (self-induced vomiting), fasting or excessive exercise. - Delayed puberty (if early onset) and in females, amenorrhoea i.e. absence of atleast three consecutive menstrual cycles.- Overeating in reaction to emotional stress. - Strange eating habits such as avoiding meals, eating in secret, monitoring every bite of food.- Irregular periods in women. - Sensitivity to cold. - Swollen glands, tooth decay. - In severe cases, the bones protrude through the skin, as there is hardly any body fat.- Depressive moods. - The skin may be dry and scaly.- Persistent over-concern with body shape and weight.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS50- Increased body hair (excessive growth of coarse hair in women).- Exercising or dieting excessively. - Using laxatives, diuretics or other pills after eating when they are not needed. - Dehydration, electrolyte imbalance which can lead to kidney and heart failure. Table 7.1: Clinical Features, Signs and Symptoms of Eating Disorders People suffering from eating disorders may struggle with one or more of the following psychological problems: anxiety, distress, feeling of helplessness, low self-esteem, inability to concentrate, unable to engage in conversation and withdrawn. The reason behind the occurrence of these conditions is that the brain is literally unable to function properly due to the lack of nutrition available to the body. Thus, knowledge of these signs/symptoms is critical. Understanding the signs, symptoms will help in identifying target symptoms and behaviors that will be addressed in the treatment plan. We will learn about the management of eating disorders later in this chapter. Next, we will learn the causative factors of eating disorders. What Causes Eating Disorders The particular cause of eating disorders is not known. But it is thought to be multi- factorial in origin. The multidimensional causative factors may include: vulnerable personality; psychological conflicts - family and individual relationship; socio- cultural environmental factors - the cult of thinness, dangerous dieting, social class and race and finally genetic and constitutional factors. Socio-cultural idealization of thinness is the best-known environmental contributor to the development of eating disorders. Young children start to express apprehension about their own weight or shape or about becoming too fat. Beauty and appearance fear are critical global issues and media and advertizing are the key factors driving this concern. Pictures, television, magazines influence children's/ adolescents' concept of the ideal body shape, influencing them to want to lose weight and encouraging unrealistic standards of beauty. This concern endures through life. Bullying, weight stigma has been identified as yet another factor. Overweight girls and boys are teased and bullied about their weight by peers or family members. FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 51Individuals report coping with weight stigma by eating more food. Weight teasing or weight-based discrimination among youth thus results in weight gain, frequent binge eating, are at increased risk for eating disorder symptoms, and are more likely to have a diagnosis of binge eating disorder. Weight stigma is also a significant risk factor for depression, low self-esteem and body dissatisfaction among individuals. Occupation/profession may also play a role. Athletes are at-risk, especially those competing in sports that tend to emphasize diet, appearance, size and weight, such as weight-class sports (wrestling, rowing, horseracing etc.) and aesthetic sports (bodybuilding, gymnastics, swimming etc.). Though most athletes with eating disorders are females, but male athletes are also at-risk. Similarly, dancers have a prevalence of anorexia 10 times that of general population. Management of Eating Disorders Eating disorders management should be multidisciplinary in its approach. A multidisciplinary team comprising of a nutritionist, physician and psycho- therapists is usually involved in their management. The treatment of eating disorders can be said to have three components. A) Medical and Biochemical Management B) Nutritional Management, and C) Psychological Management In this unit, our focus will be only on nutritional management as psychological and medical management are not within our preview. Nutritional Management of Eating Disorders Here in this section, we will consider the components of the management of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa together, since the nutritional consequences and nutritional management for both these conditions are on similar lines. Malnutrition due to poor or low consumption of energy-giving macronutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins and/or micronutrients relative to individual needs is a concern with both anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. In both cases, attention needs to be given to symptoms of starvation syndrome. Starvation syndrome here refers to starvation caused either by food restriction/dieting as in anorexia nervosa or problems related to food absorption as in purging or excessive exercise may mean that insufficient energy is consumed for weight maintenance in bulimia nervosa.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS52An illustrative 3000Kcal diet plan/menu is presented in Table 7.2 for reference.

Based on the likes, dislikes of the patient the meals may be altered provided they are balanced. Some do's and don'ts related to the management of eating disorders are highlighted herewith. Remember eating disorders are long-term illnesses and people recover slowly. Be patient and encourage the patient not to give up. Do's Don'ts - Educate yourself about the eating disorder. This will equip you to help those around you suffering from the problem.- People with an eating disorder are extremely self-conscious about their eating habits. Do not nag them about eating or not eating. This will reinforce the behavior. - Family support is extremely important, especially in helping the recovering patient with everyday tasks. Educate the family, friends regarding the disorder and encourage them to attend family counseling sessions.- Do not blame or shame the person.FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 53- Encourage the patient to seek medical help. But, don't be too forceful. This will make them more anxious.- Do not hide food to keep the person from binge eating. This will create resentment. - Encourage the person not to blame herself/himself or feel guilty or dwell on causes.- Do not force the person to eat. This will make them feel out of control or childish. This will reinforce the behavior. - Encourage the patient to attend support groups and read current literature.- Don't comment positively or negatively on appearance, shape or weight. - Encourage the patient not to skip meals or talk about dieting.

A simple measure, commonly used to classify overweight and obesity across all ages is BMI (Body Mass Index). BMI is defined as a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of his/her height in meters (kg/m2). [BMI = Weight (kg)/Height (m) 2] Overweight, Obesity among Adults BMI (Body Mass Index) is considered to be the most useful population-level measure of obesity, as it is the same for both sexes and all ages of adults. The BMI based classification for adults (both International and for Asian population) is given in Table 8.1. As you may have noticed that WHO defines overweight and obesity as follows: Overweight is a BMI greater than or equal to 25; and Obesity is a BMI greater than or equal to 30. But, for the Indian population, BMI between 18.5 and 23 is considered normal, since they tend to have higher percentage of body fat even at lower BMI as compared to the UNIT - 02 Chapter 08 OVER WEIGHT/OBESITY (DEFINITION, CAUSES, CLINICAL SYMPTOMS AND DIETARY MANAGEMENT) Learning Objectives : After reading this chapter, the students will be able to: 1. Define the term overweight and obesity. 2. Explain the causes, clinical symptoms, metabolic changes and consequences of obesity. 3. Discuss the general strategies for obesity prevention. 4. Describe the dietary management of obesity.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS56European population. BMI greater than or equal to 23 is considered overweight/obese for Indian adults as indicated in Table 8.1. Body Mass Index (BMI) International Asian Categories for Adults (WHO) Note, the BMI classification presented in Table 8.1 is specific to the adult population only. This classification can be used to categorize the different grades of malnutrition. First, calculate the BMI (based on weight and height) and then check in which class the individual's BMI falls. To illustrate, an Indian female (30 years of age) who weighs 70kg and height is 1.6 meters, BMI calculated is: 70/1.6 \u00d71.6 = 27.34kg/m . As per BMI classification (Asian population in Table 8.1), the individual is obese. BMI cut-off levels for categorizing the problems of being overweight and obesity among children and adolescents are different. The BMI classification presented in Table 8.1 is not applicable to children and adolescents. WHO has given the ideal ranges of weight for a given height for children between 5-19 years of age. These Tables are useful for categorizing children as normal, under- nourished and overweight or obese. Obesity is defined based on the degree of excess fat. More than a general accumulation, the distribution of fat around the abdomen is now considered more harmful than fat around the hips. Accumulation of fat around the abdomen is indicated by higher waist circumference and is classified as central obesity. Waist circumference of 90cm for men and 80 cm for women is classified as central obesity and is associated with an increased risk of several chronic diseases.FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 57 Figure 8.1: Fat Around Abdomen Measurements Descriptions Skinfold thickness (SFT)Skin fold thickness is being used for estimating the body fat content. This requires special instruments called 'calipers'. Skin folds at different parts of the body (triceps, biceps, sub-scapular, supra-iliac, front thigh and calf) have been used for estimating body fat. Specific equations are used to convert the skin fold thickness into the body fat content. Advantage: Relatively simpler, non-invasive and apart from the total body fat content, it can also indicate about the body fat distribution. Waist circumference (WC)WC is a highly sensitive and specific measure of central obesity. Cut off values for adults are available as highlighted earlier. Advantage: Simple technique Disadvantage: For children no Indian data is available and not widely used. Waist hip ratio (WHR)WHR= Waist circumference / Hip circumference. WHR cut-offs are available for adult males and females but not for children. WHR of more than 0.9 among men and 0.85 in women are associated with an increased risk of several chronic diseases. Table 8.2: Indirect Measures of Body Fathness (other than BMI)CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS58Why should we avoid Obesity? Maintaining ideal body weight is vital for good health. There is no particular definition of ideal body weight, but body weight for a given height of a person with good health and a long lifespan is considered as ideal body weight. Excessive body weight increases the risk of chronic diseases such as hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, certain types of cancers, osteoarthritis etc. Excess body fat largely affects every organ in the body with multi-organ consequences. Major health consequences have been illustrated in Figure 8.3. Figure 8.3: Major Health Consequences of Overweight and Obesity Overweight children are not only at a risk to become obese adults, and consequently suffer from ill health and premature death, but serious complications can also occur during their childhood. Children with obesity have more risk factors for heart disease like high blood pressure and high cholesterol than their normal weight peers. Children with obesity are also at a higher risk for having other chronic health conditions and diseases, such as asthma, sleep apnea, bone and joint problems. Type 2 diabetes is increasingly being reported among children who are obese. The onset of diabetes in children can lead to heart disease and kidney failure.FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 59Overweight and obese adolescents may also suffer from: Depression, low self-esteem, and behavioral problems. Stigmatization (teasing, harassment, and rejection) and bullying behavior by their peers. Psychological distress manifested by poor self-image, aggressive and negative behavior, depression, suicide. Drug abuse, alcohol and tobacco addiction. In view of the growing obesity prevalence, many young children and adolescents have developed a 'fear of fatness' and are adopting various dietary and behavioral practices to lose weight and remain thin, even if they have normal BMI. It is more seen in urban areas at this moment. These individuals are at a higher risk of developing eating disorders. Other than the health consequences which are discussed above, body fatness has other implications also. These are academic and economic burdens. It has been projected that obesity accounts for 2% to 7% of total healthcare costs in developed countries. There are also other costs to consider such as reduced quality of life and productivity, loss attributed to decreased work efficiency and medical issues. With regards to academic consequences, among overweight adolescents, higher school absenteeism, dropout and lower academic achievement have been seen. But, drawing a definite conclusion on this issue is difficult. Considering the ill effects of obesity, it is important that we look at the causes of obesity. The next section focuses on the etiology of obesity. What Causes Obesity? Figure 8.4: The Causes and Risk Factors of ObesityCENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS60Overweight and obesity, are generally the result of an imbalance between energy intake (food) and energy expenditure (physical activity and some other metabolic activity). The imbalance might be due to excess energy intake (overeating) or reduced energy expenditure (sedentary lifestyle). The excess energy consumed is stored in the body in the form of adipose tissue. When food availability is less, it could be seen as a survival mechanism, but when food is abundant and the physical activity level decreases, this results in fat deposition. Table 8.5 lists the key factors that might promote weight gain and obesity. - High intake of energy-dense, micronutrient poor foods; - Heavy marketing of energy-dense foods and fast-food outlets; - High intake of sugar-sweetened soft drinks and fruit juices; - Sedentary lifestyle; - Adverse socio-economic conditions; - Large portion sizes; - High proportion of food prepared and eaten outside the home; - Rigid restraint/periodic disinhibition eating patterns; - Alcohol. Table 8.5: Summary of Factors that Promote Weight Gain and Obesity Source : Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation. WHO Technical Report Series 916: Diet, Nutrition and the Prevention of Chronic Diseases. World Health Organization; Geneva, Switzerland: 2003 As discussed in Table 8.3, increased risk factors include a higher energy density diet with increased intake of fat and added sugars, salt in foods. Eating unhealthy or junk foods coupled with low physical activity (sedentary lifestyle) promotes weight gain. Saturated fat intake (mostly from animal sources), marked increase in animal food consumption, reduced intake of complex carbohydrates and dietary fiber, and reduced fruit and vegetable intake are other contributing factors. Over- feeding during infancy, childhood and adolescence predispose to overweight/ obesity in adulthood. Further, lack of access to healthy foods as determined by adverse socioeconomic conditions influences the diet and health of a population. Energy-dense and nutrient-poor foods provide daily calories at an affordable cost to the poor groups FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 61hence consumed in large portions. On the other hand, the commercial-driven food market environment is the other possible cause of obesity. The traditional micronutrient-rich foods consumed by children/families are replaced by heavily marketed, sugar-sweetened beverages (i.e. soft drinks) and energy dense fatty, salty and sugar foods (HFSS snacks), contributing to obesity. The dietary changes discussed above are compounded by lifestyle changes that reflect reduced physical activity at work/school and during leisure time. Evidence suggests that insufficient physical activity is one of the important risk factors of obesity, and work-related activity has declined over recent decades, whereas, leisure time dominated by television viewing and other physically inactive pastimes has increased, particularly among children. Considering the multifaceted causes of obesity, it is important that appropriate strategies based on improved dietary practices and physical activity for prevention of obesity are considered. The next section focuses on prevention strategies followed by dietary management of obesity. General Strategies for Obesity Prevention The prevention of being given overweight/obesity in infants, young children, adolescents and adults should be considered a high priority. There can be no single or simple solution to the increasing prevalence of obesity. It is a serious problem and there has to be a multifaceted approach. Policy makers, state and local governments/ organizations, business and community leaders, schools, childcare and healthcare professionals, parents and individuals must work together to create an environment that supports a healthy lifestyle. For infants and young children, the main preventive strategies should focus on: The promotion of exclusive breastfeeding; Avoiding the use of added sugars and starches when feeding formula; Instructing mothers to accept their child's ability to regulate energy intake rather than feeding until the plate is empty; Assuring the appropriate micronutrient intake for the child is needed to promote optimal growth and development. For school children a nd adolescents, prevention of obesity implies the need to: Promote an active lifestyle; limit television viewing;CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS62 promote the intake of fruits and vegetables (at least 5 servings of fruits and vegetables daily); restrict the intake of unhealthy, energy-dense, micronutrient-poor foods (e.g., packaged snacks (rich in fat, sugar and salt), refined grains and sweets, potatoes etc); restrict the intake of sugars-sweetened soft drinks, sports drinks and fruit juice drinks; improving sleep; reducing stress. The home environment too is another important setting in preventing overweight and obesity. Parents can play a crucial role. Potential areas to target in terms of television viewing, home food and physical activity environment include: Purchasing healthy foods; Practicing regular meal times; Encouraging the children to eat only when hungry and to eat slowly; Allocating individual portions of food for children; Keep the refrigerator stocked with fat-free or low-fat milk and fresh fruit and vegetables instead of soft drinks and snacks high in sugar and fat; Creating opportunities for physical activities; Parents as role models. Parents who eat healthy foods and are physically active set an example that increases the likelihood that their children will do the same; Messages to parents to not having a television in children's room and encouraging family rules restricting television viewing. Children should be motivated to participate in at least 60 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity, preferably daily in the form of sports and physical activity. Some examples of moderate intensity physical activity may include: brisk walking, skipping (rope jumping), playing soccer, swimming, dancing etc. In addition to encouraging physical activity, children should avoid too much sedentary time. Parents should limit the time children watch television, play video games, or surf the web to no more than 2 hours per day. Additionally, television viewing for children age 2 or younger may be best avoided. Instead, encourage children to find FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 63fun activities to do with family members or on their own that simply involve more activity. Preventive measures for adults: The preventive measures highlighted above may apply to prevent obesity among adults too. Some healthy eating practices and points to consider that may protect against weight gain may include: Eating five to six servings of vegetables and fruits daily; choosing whole grain foods and avoiding highly processed foods made with refined flour, sugar and saturated fat in the diet; avoiding foods that are high in 'energy density' or that have lots of calories in a small amount of food; minimizing sugar-sweetened beverages. Preventive strategies for adults may also include the promotion of small changes in physical activity. A total of 60 min of physical activity is recommended every day for healthy Asian Indians. This should include at least 30 min of moderate-intensity aerobic activity (e.g. brisk walking, jogging, hiking, bicycling, gardening etc), 15 min of work-related activity e.g. carrying heavy loads, climbing stairs etc.), and 15 min of muscle-strengthening exercises (at least 3-4 times a week). Note- Inactive people should start slow and gradually increase physical activity. The food industry can play a significant role in promoting healthy diets by: Reducing the fat, sugar and salt content of processed foods; ensuring that healthy and nutritious choices are available and affordable to all consumers; restricting marketing of foods high in sugars, salt and fats, especially those foods aimed at children and teenagers; and ensuring the availability of healthy food choices and supporting regular physical activi ty practice in the workplace. Preven tion is always better than cure. Maintaining a desirable body weight by consuming just enough calories or adjusting the physical activity to maintain energy balance (i.e. intake = output) is critical to prevent and treat obesity. The next focus in this unit is how to maintain energy balance and reduce weight.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS64Dietary Management of Obesity A combination of interventions/strategies may be adopted to manage obesity. These include: a. Dietary modifications; b. increase in physical activity and reduction in sedentary lifestyle; c. behavioural modifications. Successful treatment, management of overweight, obesity require adoption and maintenance of lifestyle behaviors contributing to both dietary intake and physical activity. The role of physical activity in reducing prevalence of obesity has already been highlighted in the section on prevention. Here we shall focus on dietary management of obesity. The objective of diet planning for overweight/obese individuals must focus on: Promoting gradual weight reduction; preventing muscle loss and other nutritional deficiencies; helping to maintain a desirable body weight; and bring positive behavioral changes (diet/ life-style management). To meet these objectives the nutrient needs and dietary modifications for overweight/ obese are highlighted in Table 8.6. Dietary requirementsRecommendations Dietary Considerations Energy (Kcal) For adults For older children and adolescentWeight reduction: Moderate deficit diet - 1200- 1500 Kcal/day for women, and - 1500-1800 Kcal/day for men Low-Calorie diet - 1000 -1200 Kcal/day for women, and - 1200- 1500 Kcal/day for men Adult guidelines may be adoptedDeficit of 500 Kcal/day will help produce a weight loss of 500g per week Deficit of 750 - 1000 Kcal/day will help produce a weight loss of 1 kg per week - Restrict the intake of high fat, sugar, salt (HFSS) foods. - Avoid foods that are high in 'energy density' or that have lots of calories in a small amount of food.FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 65Dietary requirementsRecommendation Dietary Considerations Proteins (g) (15-20% of total calories provided by proteins)Adequate protein intake (1g/kg body weight) to: - ensure proper metabolism - prevent muscle loss, and - provide higher satiety (makes the individual feel full).Emphasis should be laid on the inclusion of protein rich foods from plant origin (pulses, lentils, beans etc.) rather than from animal sources as the former are low in fat but high in dietary fibre. Among animal sources, choose lean meats, poultry, fish. Carbohydrate (CHO) (50-55% of total calories to be provided by carbohydrates)CHO are made up of three components - Starch, fibre and sugar. Fibre and starch are complex CHO. Sugar is simple CHO. Complex carbohydrates: - provide bulk and satiety value to reducing diet, and - helpful in bowel movement.Complex carbohydrates from whole grain cereals and their products like oatmeal, whole wheat bread etc. and pulses with husk; Vegetables (peas, beans), high fibre fruits (preferably raw with their edible peel), may be preferred. -Foods such as potatoes, white bread, noodles, pasta and those made from simple/refined carbohydrates need to be restricted. - Sugar, jaggery, sugar candies, cookies, chips, chocolates etc. should be strictly restricted. - Sweet beverages particularly juices, sports drink, sweetened soft drinks best avoided. Fats and Oils (30% or less of total calories to be provided by total fat)Dietary fat induces over consumption and weight gain through its: - low satiety properties, and - high caloric density.- Vegetable oils (mustard, olive, soyabean, corn, sunflower oil) should be given preference. - Butter, cream, pure ghee should be avoided. - Foods rich in saturated fats such as red meats, whole milk and its products and nuts/oil seeds should be avoided. - Include low-fat or non-fat milk or dairy products (skimmed milk). - Avoid full- cream milk and other milk products made from full-cream milk. - Fried foods, bakery products should be strictly avoided. - Use non-stick cookware/ micro- wave for cooking. - Prefer steam/pressure cooking to deep frying.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS66Dietary requirementsRecommendation Dietary Considerations Vitamins and Minerals (Meet the daily dietary recommended intake)Despite excess dietary calorie intake, obese individuals: - have high rate of micronutrient deficiencies (namely thiamine, folic acid, vitamin C, Zinc, selenium deficiency). -are at risk of developing deficiency of fat-soluble. vitamins (such as Vitamin A, Vitamin D deficiency). Consumption of plenty of fruits and vegetables will help: - maintain adequate micronutrient intake, and - provide satiety.Provide 5-6 servings of vegetables and fruits daily which may include: - raw non-starch vegetables (radish, cucumber etc.) and green leafy vegetables yellow and orange colored fruits/ vegetables, - low-calorie fruits (apple, oranges, pear, guava etc.) preferably with their edible peels. - Incorporate fermented foods and sprouted pulses / legumes to help in improving the bioavailability of several nutrients. - Use oils fortified with vitamin A/D. Dietary Fibre (25- 30g per day)Dietary fibre sources - proper bowel function - provide satiety (fullness) - reduce hunger and prevent overeating. - Provide micronutrients and phytochemicals that may improve health, and - are less calorie dense and low in fat and sugar.- Consume 5-6 servings of fruits and vegetables daily. - Include green leafy vegetables and raw vegetables, fruits with hard skin in the form of salads - Include whole grain cereals and their products like oatmeal, whole wheat bread, whole pulses and pulses with husk. - Spoon full of finely ground husk/ bran of cereals/pulses in glass of water before meals may be provided as it gives a feeling of satiety Fluids (Liberal intake)Liberal fluids intake is desired to: - compensate for the fluid losses in the body through skin and sweat, - ensure adequate volume of urine to eliminate wastes, - prevent dehydration and, - maintain water balance.Fluid intake can be accomplished through a variety of beverages, soups, juices, broths, dal, coconut water besides plain water.

It is important to note that men/women, young/old/adults all are at risk of this problem and it is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease, heart failure, renal disease and other complications. What is alarming is the fact that hypertension is known as a silent killer. It often occurs without any symptoms or warning signs until a more severe problem arises. Modifying lifestyle and routine is important for managing hypertension. Hypertension is a health condition that is characterized by high blood pressure. Blood pressure (BP) is the force of blood circulation against the inner walls of blood vessels. When blood travels through the blood vessels with more force than is considered healthy, it is called hypertension. An instrument/devise called a sphygmomanometer is used to measure BP. An optimum blood pressure level is reading under 120/80mm Hg. The numerator 120 represents the pressure when the heart contracts and is referred to as \"Systolic pressure\". The systolic measurement is the peak pressure in the arteries. The denominator 80 represents the pressure when the heart relaxes (is at rest) between beats, called the \"Diastolic pressure\". Diastolic pressure is the minimum pressure in the arteries. Recent guidelines have given the classification of blood pressure and the stages of hypertension (in adults) based on blood pressure values as highlighted below in Table 9.1UNIT - 03 Chapter 09 HYPERTENSION (DEFINITION, CAUSES, PHYSIOLOGICAL CONDITIONS, COMPLICATIONS AND DIETARY MANAGEMENT) Learning Objectives : After reading this chapter, the students will be able to: 1.

Describe the dietary management and prevention of hypertension with special emphasis on lifestyle modification.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS72Blood Pressure Category Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP)Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) Normal <120 mm Hg <80 mm Hg Elevated 120-129 mm Hg <80 mm Hg Hypertension Stage 1 130-139 mm Hg 80-89 mm Hg Stage 2 140 mm Hg 90 mm Hg Hypertensive Crisis 180 mm Hg 120 mm Hg Table 9.1: Classification of Blood Pressure and the Stages of Hypertension Symptoms and Physiological Conditions I. Consequences of hypertension: (a) Damage to arteries and Blood Vessels: Hypertension gradually increases the pressure flowing through the arteries leading to damaged or narrowed arteries. Once the arteries are damaged, the fat from the diet enters the blood stream and tends to get collected in the inner walls of arteries, over a period of time, it leads to the narrowing of the lumen of the arteries, as a result, artery walls become less elastic, limiting blood flow through the body. The diseases of the arteries resulting from the blockage of arteries are generally called Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). Figure 9.1 Blood Vessel (b) Damage to Heart: The major function of the heart is to pump blood to the entire body. Uncontrolled blood pressure can damage the heart in various FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 73ways. It affects the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscles. When blood cannot flow freely to the heart, the individual can experience chest pain (angina), a heart attack or irregular heartbeat or irregular rhythm (arrhythmias). Over the time, strain on the heart caused by high BP can cause the heart muscle to weaken and work less efficiently. High blood pressure then forces the heart to work harder than necessary in order to pump blood to the rest of the body. This causes the ventricle to thicken and stiffen, limiting the ventricle's ability to pump blood thus, increasing the risk of heart attack, heart failure or sudden death. Signs of heart failure include shortness of breath or troubled breathing, swelling in the feet, ankles, legs or abdomen, fatigue etc. (c) Damage to Brain: Like the heart, the brain also requires a constant supply of blood. Blood carries nourishing food to the brain so that it can work properly. Sometimes, there can be a temporary disruption of blood supply to the brain caused by artery blockage or a blood clot both of which can arise from high blood pressure. Interruption of blood flow to the brain can lead to symptoms of mild cognitive impairment or to dementia, a brain disease resulting in problems with thinking, speaking, reasoning, memory, vision and movement. Uncontrolled high BP can damage and weaken the brain's blood vessels causing them to narrow, rupture or leak leading to forming blood clots in the arteries (leading to the brain).This can block blood flow to the brain causing stroke. Stroke is a condition when part of the brain is deprived of oxygen and nutrients, causing brain cells to die. (d) Damage to Kidneys: Major function of the kidneys is to filter extra fluids and waste from the blood - a process that depends on healthy blood vessels. Like the blood vessels in the brain and the heart, high BP can damage large arteries leading to kidney and the tiny blood vessels within the kidney. As a result, kidneys are unable to filter extra fluid/waste leading to kidney failure. (e) Damage to Eyes: Like other blood vessels these too can be damaged due to high BP. Blood vessels supplying blood to the retina (membrane that lines the inner surface of the back of the eyeball) when damaged can lead to bleeding in the eyes, blurred vision and in severe cases even to complete loss of vision. (f) Sleep Disorder: Some people experience loud snoring and breathing interruptions during a night's sleep. This condition is called sleep apnea. People with sleep apnea often don't feel fresh when they wake up in the morning. Research has linked this condition to high blood pressure.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS74II. Causes of Hypertension The factors that play important role in causing or increasing the risk of getting a disease are called risk factors. Table 9.2 highlights the risk factors for hypertension. Smoking, diabetes, high lipid levels (cholesterol, triglyceride), excessive weight, low fitness, unhealthy diet, psycho-social stress, sleep disturbances are some of the risk factors. In Table 9.2 you will notice that these factors are categorized as modifiable and non- modifiable. Modifiable Risk Factors Relatively Fixed/Non-modifiable Risk Factors - Cigarette smoking, second hand smoking - Diabetes mellitus - Dyslipidemia/ hypercholesterolemia - Overweight/obesity - Physical inactivity/low fitness - Unhealthy diet- CAD - Family history - Increased age - Low socioeconomic/educational status - Obstructive sleep apnea - Psychosocial stress Table 9.2: Risk Factors Common in Patients with Hypertension Dietary factors are an important determinant of the development and progression of hypertension. It is one of the important modifiable risk factors for hypertension. Unhealthy diets consisting of high fat, salt, sugar (HFSS) foods are the main culprit. Most commonly consumed HFSS foods include chips, fried foods, sugar sweetened carbonated and non- carbonated beverages, pizzas, burgers, ready-to- eat noodles, potato fries, and confectionery items. There is a strong connection between salt intake and blood pressure. Excessive salt intake has been associated with an increased prevalence of hypertension and a rise in systolic pressure with age. Excessive sodium intake can cause the body to retain fluid and also cause arteries/blood vessels to constrict, which thereby increases blood pressure. Also a diet high in calories, saturated fats like ghee, butter and food rich in animal fats (such as whole milk, red meat, organ meats), trans fats (deep-fried snacks/foods, bakery products etc.) and processed, packaged foods such as chips, cookies etc. carries an additional risk of hypertension. Packaged and processed foods often have a high amount of sodium added during manufacturing either as salt or as baking soda.FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 75Hypertension is often present in individuals who are overweight and obese. In fact, hypertension is strongly associated with a high Body Mass Index (BMI). More the weight, more is the blood flow required to supply oxygen and nutrients to the tissues. As the volume of the blood increases so does the pressure inside the arteries. Hence, people who are obese are likely to have higher blood pressure. Physical inactivity or low fitness also increases the risk of obesity along with hypertension. Regular exercise increases blood flow through the arteries and releases substances that relax blood vessels, which in turn lower blood pressure. Remember, a sedentary lifestyle devoid of exercise increases the risk of blood pressure. Along with a sedentary lifestyle, smoking/tobacco intake are other modifiable risk factors. What must be emphasized here is that all these factors also make elevated blood pressure difficult to control despite progressively increasing doses of medication. Hence, lifestyle/dietary management is important for such patients in order to avoid drug dependency. Management of Hypertension & Dietetics Dietary/nutritional management is the cornerstone of hypertension management. We will focus on this aspect in more detail here. I. Nutritional Management of Hypertension The main objective of dietary management of hypertension is to: Achieve gradual weight loss in overweight and obese individuals and maintain weight slightly below the normal level; Reduce sodium intake and maintain fluid and electrolyte balance; Maintain adequate nutrition in the diet; and Slow down the onset of complications. High Sodium Content Foods Low Sodium Content Food - Pizza, instant soups, burgers, buns, rolls, sandwiches, biscuits, cookies- Unprocessed whole foods like cereal grains such as whole wheat, wheat flour, oats, vermicelli, jowar, bajra, brown rice, rice flakes; all pulses, dried beans and peas - Processed foods like ham, sausages, cold cuts of meat,- Fresh fruits like apples, oranges, banana, pears, berries etc.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS76- Processed cheese - Fresh green leafy vegetables and other vegetables such as spinach, fenugreek leaves, mustard leaves, carrots, spinach, cauliflower, pepper, capsicum etc. - Savoury snacks (namkeen, samosa, pakora, chips, French fries, salted popcorn etc.).- Roots and tubers such as colocasia (arbi), potato, sweet potato, radish etc. - Sauces, tomato ketchup, gravies, curry powders, - Ready-to-eat cereals, cakes, pies, patties.- Fresh fish, chicken, lean meat. - Full cream milk. - Fat-free or low-fat milk, yogurt, soymilk. - Canned vegetables and canned meat/ fish, frozen packaged meals/foods.- Vegetable oils (soybean, corn, canola, sunflower, olive oil. - Organ meat (liver, kidney, brain), crabs, prawns.- Seasonings such as herbs, spices, garlic, ginger, onion, lemon and lime juice. - Proprietary drinks such as Bournvita, Horlicks, chocolate drinks.

As per the salt restriction prescribed, mild Sodium restriction: 2-3 g or Moderate sodium restriction: 1g or strict Sodium restriction: 0.5 g diet may be planned by judicious selection of foods. Some handy lifestyle modifications and proven interventions for prevention and treatment of hypertension are summarized herewith for your reference. (Table 9.5) Lifestyle ModificationsRecommendation/Intervention Weight Loss - The best goal is to maintain an ideal body weight. BMI (Weight (kg)/Height (m)2) < 22.9 kg/ m2 (Asian population). Waist circumference should also be maintained at an appropriate level (< 90cm for men and < 80 cm for women). - Aim for at least 1 kg reduction in body weight for most adults who are overweight. 1kg reduction in body weight will reduce blood pressure by 1mm/Hg. Healthy Diet - Provide a rich-fiber diet such as: Whole grain cereals (wheat, maize, Dalia, oats etc.) and cereal products (whole wheat bread, multigrain bread etc.). Do not sieve wheat flour. Add bran to wheat flour, if needed. Whole pulses such as Chana, Lobia, Rajmah etc., include sprouted pulses in the diet as salads, or as a filling. Plenty of vegetables in the diet, particularly fresh green vegetables as salads in both meals. Whole fruits (4-5 servings), preferably with edible peel. - Use healthy oils such as soybean oil, rapeseed oil, mustard oil. - Include low-fat dairy and dairy products. - Intake of fish and poultry to be encouraged.FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 79Reduced intake of dietary sodium- Select foods that are low in sodium. - Watch out for processed food, packaged foods and restaurant food, especially fast food, which tend to be high in salt. - Lower the salt intake. The target of salt restriction is <3 g/ day. - No added salt. Avoid the use of table salt. Use lemon, vinegar, tamarind etc. for flavoring salads. Enhanced intake of dietary potassium- Enhance the intake of dietary potassium. Include foods rich in potassium like fruits, vegetables etc. Physical Activity - Encourage physical activity such as brisk walking for at least 30- 45 minutes every day or any other moderate intensity exercise such as active yoga, swimming, biking, aerobic exercises etc. Quit Smoking Limit the intake of Alcohol- No smoking. - Moderate amount of alcohol should be taken. Table 9.5: Lifestyle Modifications and Interventions for Prevention and Treatment of Hypertension Do's Don'ts - Encourage the patient not to skip meals. Take meals at regular intervals.- Avoid high fat, sugar, salt foods and other junk foods. - Increase the intake of foods rich in dietary fiber and complex carbohydrates such as. whole grain cereals, ragi, legumes, sprouted grams, fruits and vegetables.- Avoid table salt. - Include plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables in the diet instead of processed foods.- Avoid salted butter, processed cheese, fried and salted snacks such as poories, kachori, pakora, samosa, chips, popcorn, salted nuts, biscuits etc.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS80- Include low calories snacks in the diet.- Limit canned or ready-to-eat foods such as namkeen, soups, preserved foods such as pappad, pickles, sauces, chutneys etc. as they are rich in fat, salt and preservatives. - Include toned or skimmed milk and its products in the diet.- Avoid gravies made with saturated fats such as butter, ghee, dalda, margarine etc. - Egg white, lean meat, chicken, fish may be included in limited amounts.- Avoid ajinomoto (monosodium glutamate), mayonnaise/ salad dressings, baking powder, soda/diet coke etc. - Advice the individual to read nutrition labels. Look for foods labeled 'Low Sodium' or 'No Salt Added'.- Avoid refined cereals like maida, suji etc. - Encourage the patient to quit smoking, if patient is a smoker.- Avoid whole/full cream milk and its products. - Encourage the individual to quit alcohol or limit alcohol intake.

Newspaper articles, TV commercials promising simple, home remedies for the cure of sugar problems are on the rise. Today, this sugar problem or \"Diabetes\" has become a major public health problem in our country. In this chapter, we will consider the risk factors, symptoms and complications of diabetes with major focus on the management of diabetes. Diet, exercise, drugs, communication and nutrition education/awareness as major components of dietary management will be highlighted. Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a condition when the blood glucose or so called \"blood sugar\" is too high. Diabetes is a disease that affects body's ability to produce or respond to insulin. Insulin, is a hormone that is releases in response to food we eat. In a normal healthy person, the pancreas releases insulin to help the body store and use the sugar from the food they eat. Foods, particularly carbohydrate- rich foods in our diet namely, rice, wheat, potatoes etc. are digested and broken down into a simple sugar called glucose. Glucose is vital for our health because it is an important source of energy for our body. Insulin helps to utilize this glucose to produce energy by the body for our daily activities. Insulin also stimulates the cells to assimilate glucose, thus preventing a rise in blood glucose and maintaining its level within certain normal limits.UNIT - 03 Chapter 10 DIABETES MELLITUS (DEFINITION, CAUSES, PHYSIOLOGICAL CONDITIONS, COMPLICATIONS AND DIETARY MANAGEMENT) Learning Objectives : After reading this chapter, the students will be able to: 1. Define the term Diabetes and present the classification of Diabetes; 2. Explain the causes, clinical symptoms, complications of Diabetes; and 3. Elaborate the management of Diabetes, with a focus on diet therapy and dietary management.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS82Symptoms & Physiological Conditions In diabetic individuals, the pancreas (the organ that produces insulin) cannot produce enough amount of insulin or whatever is produced is not efficiently used by the body and sugar builds up in the blood (hyperglycemia). This condition when insulin is not efficiently used by the body is called insulin resistance. Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic syndrome characterized by hyperglycaemia with disturbance of carbohydrate metabolism resulting from the defect in insulin secretion, insulin action or both. In diabetes, there is excessive glucose in blood and urine due to inadequate production of insulin or insulin resistance. Generally, in normal persons, without diabetes fasting glucose levels are maintained at a range less than 110mg/dl. Figure 10.1: Pancreas Plasma Glucose Level (mg/dl) Fasting Post Diabetes >126 10.1: Criterion for the Diagnosis of Diabetes Source: ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes, 2005FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 83You would notice that Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) more than or equal to 126mg/dl and Plasma Glucose Level 2-hour post-meal (or post 75g glucose) more than or equal to 200mg/dl is diagnosed as diabetes. Generally, glucose is excreted in urine when blood glucose levels are high and beyond 180mg/dl. This condition is described as renal glycosuria. It may be noted that diabetic patients lose the varying amounts of glucose in urine depending on the severity of diseases and dietary intake of carbohydrates in their diet. Another concept, important to diabetes status, which needs special mention here, is Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HBA1c). When the concentration of glucose in the blood rises, more of it gets attached to hemoglobin ( a pigment present in red blood cells that carries oxygen to the cells of the body) forming glycosylated hemoglobin (HBA1c). In a normal individual without diabetes, the HBA1c concentration varies from 5-6%, while in diabetics, it increases to over 6% of the total hemoglobin depending on the blood glucose level. So what is the significance of HBA1c? HBA1c shows the general trend of glucose levels in the blood during the previous 2-3 months. HBA1c helps determine how well a person's diabetes is being controlled over the time. I. Types of Diabetes There are two main types of diabetes: Type 1 Diabetes and Type 2 Diabetes Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus Type 1 diabetes results from the pancreas's failure to produce insulin. This form was previously referred to as 'insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus' (IDDM) or 'juvenile diabetes', Type 1 diabetes may affect people at any age, but usually develops in children and adolescents, hence was referred to as juvenile diabetes earlier. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease. Autoimmune refers to the fact that the body's immune system (which normally helps in fighting infections) attacks and destroys the insulin producing cells of the pancreas. As a result there is little or no production of insulin and hence, such individuals require daily dose of insulin injections to control the level of glucose in the blood. When insulin is not provided it can lead to life threatening consequences.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS84Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 diabetes is the common form of diabetes, with 90-95% of people with diabetes having this condition. Type 2 diabetes begins with insulin resistance. This means no matter how much or how little insulin is made, the body cannot use it, and sugar builds up in the blood. As the disease progresses eventually no insulin is produced. This form was previously referred to as 'non-insulin dependent diabetes' or 'adult onset diabetes', because it was diagnosed mainly in adults, who did not require insulin to manage their condition. It is associated with excessive body weight and/or fat (obesity) or sedentary lifestyle. Type 2 diabetes can occur at any age. Type 2 diabetes can be managed through exercise and diet but overtime people with this type of diabetes may require oral anti-diabetic drugs or/and insulin depending on the condition. Besides the two types of diabetes highlighted above, you may come across cases where diabetes developed during pregnancy. This is referred to as gestational diabetes. Gestational Diabetes When a pregnant woman develops diabetes, it is known as gestational diabetes. Gestational diabetes usually disappears after pregnancy but is associated with complications to both mother and baby. The offsprings are prone to develop childhood obesity and type 2 diabetes later in life as an adult. Women with a history of gestational diabetes may also go on to develop type 2 diabetes immediately after delivery or a few years after delivery. Considering the different types of Diabetes it is important that we look at the risk factors associated with diabetes. The next section focuses on the risk factors. Risk factors of Diabetes The causes of diabetes are multi-factorial and depending on the type of diabetes the risk factors contributing to the onset of the disease may vary. Actual cause is not clear, but factors that have been shown to increase the risk of diabetes are highlighted below.FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 85 Figure 10.2: Risk Factors of Diabetes In case of type 1 diabetes, it is an auto-immune disease. What is known is that, the immune system (which fights infections, harmful bacteria, viruses in our body) attacks and destroys the insulin producing cells in the pancreas. For example, viral infections such as measles, mumps can trigger an abnormal auto immune response that destroy the insulin producing cells in the pancreas. Thus, little or no insulin is produced. Instead of being transported to the cells, sugar then builds up in the blood. Genetic and environmental factors play a vital role in the onset of this condition.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS86Type 2 diabetes, which you have learned is the most common form of diabetes, is caused by many factors but the two important risk factors include lifestyle factors and genes. Among lifestyle factors, lack of physical activity, overweight, obesity increase the risk of developing diabetes in the later stage of an indvidual's life. You would notice that about 90% of type 2 diabetic individuals are overweight or obese. Central obesity (accumulation of fat around the abdomen indicated by higher waist circumference) is known to increase insulin resistance. How does obesity increase the risk of diabetes? Well, obesity reduces the sensitivity of tissues to insulin action in the utilization of glucose. Next, unhealthy eating habits and practices (such as eating too much of fat, simple sugars, and refined foods and not consuming enough fiber in the diet) have been shown to influence the occurrence of diabetes. Further, type 2 diabetes seems to run in families, indicating genetic predisposition or hereditary as a risk factor. Among other factors, ageing i.e. increased age enhances the risk of type 2 diabetes. Stress which is so common in modern life is now increasingly being recognized as a risk factor for the disease onset and progression. Having gone through the risk factors, you may have realized that many of these factors can be controlled by modifying your lifestyle. For instance, physical inactivity, obesity, unhealthy diets, stress can be controlled and are therefore called as modifiable risk factors. Others such as hereditary, age, history of gestational diabetes cannot be changed or modified, hence are fixed. Remember, the risk for diabetes increases if an individual is: overweight and obese, particularly abdominal obesity i.e. accumulation of fat around the abdomen indicated by higher waist circumference; on an unhealthy diet, consuming too much fat, simple sugars, refined foods and low intake of dietary fiber and roughage(inadequate fruit and vegetable consumption); age 40 or older. Risk increases as one grows old; has a parent or sibling with diabetes; physically inactive i.e. living a sedentary life; has high blood pressure, high cholesterol or high triglyceride; have had gestational diabetes. So the more the risk factors one has, the greater are the chances of developing diabetes and other health issues.FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 87Complications of Diabetes The symptoms of diabetes are very typical, but sometimes they are so mild that we don't even notice them. But in cases of Type 1 diabetes, the symptoms usually happen quickly and are much more severe as compared to type 2 diabetes. However, you would notice that both types of diabetes have some warning symptoms which include: Frequent and increased/excessive urinary output (Polyuria); Feeling of thirst (Polydipsia) and dry mouth; Hunger increased appetite (Polyphagia) even though the individual is eating; Extreme fatigue, lack of energy, easy tiredness and irritability; Unexplained Weight loss; Blurry vision; Frequent infections such as skin, vaginal infections; Cuts, bruises, sores which are slow to heal; and Tingling sensation, pain or numbness in the hands and feet. The symptoms may seem mild, but it is important to note that diabetes can increase the risk of many serious health problems, if not controlled. Diabetes can cause a host of complications - acute as well as long term - affecting nearly each and every organ in our body including the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, gums, teeth etc. But, the good news is that controlling diabetes can help avoid these complications or prevent them from becoming worse. The Acute Complications of Diabetes Include: Diabetic Ketoacidosis: Ketoacidosis is a serious complication of diabetes that occurs when the body produces high levels of blood acids called ketones. How are ketones formed? When there is not enough insulin, the body cannot utilize carbohydrates to provide energy. So, to meet the energy needs, the body begins to break down fat as a fuel. This results in increased formation of ketones. When the ketones produced are more than what the body can handle, they accumulate in the blood resulting in ketoacidosis. Note, ketoacidosis can be fatal, and the patient may go into coma. This condition usually results from irregular or inadequate management of diabetes, particularly during stress and acute infections. Among long-term complications, heart diseases and blood vessel diseases are common problems. Due to injury to large blood vessels, diabetics have increased predisposition to atherosclerosis (hardening of blood vessels due to deposition CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS88of fatty substances). Diabetics may have high levels of blood lipids, such as cholesterol and triglycerides, which make them susceptible to heart diseases and stroke. Diabetes can also lead to eye problems such as glaucoma, which may cause blindness if not treated. So the bottom line for diabetic patients is to get tight control of the blood glucose levels and thus prevent the complications from getting worse. Besides the acute and the long-term complications highlighted above, one short-term complications of diabetes which requires mention here is hypoglycemia. Unlike increased glucose levels in the blood, the rapid and severe lowering of blood glucose below certain critical normal limit (below 40 - 50 mg/dl) in the body is known as hypoglycemia. The person with hypoglycemia experiences weakness, sweating, restlessness, palpitation and giddiness. What may be the cause of hypoglycemia? It is possible for the blood glucose levels to drop when there is inadequate amount of carbohydrates in the diet, particularly under conditions when an individual is on insulin or taking insulin on an empty stomach or while fasting. Hypoglycemia can also occur following strenuous exercise. Cases of hypoglycemia can be treated by immediately providing orange juice or glucose, sugar or sweet, which can rapidly increase the blood glucose level. It is always advisable for a diabetic to carry any one of these substances as a protective measure. Remember, maintenance of blood glucose within normal limits helps to prevent and limit the progression of diabetic complications. A patient who maintains the blood glucose levels within the normal range suffers from much less, short and long term complications as compared to those who frequently experience fluctuations (some time high, sometime low) in the blood glucose levels. Management of Diabetes & Dietetics It is important to understand that diabetes cannot be completely cured or treated, but it can be managed carefully in order to prevent/delay the development of complications. Management of diabetes is quite individualized and focuses not only on the diabetic state but also on the overall health and well-being of the diabetic patient. There are four main aspects in the management of diabetes. These include: Dietary Management; Lifestyle Management - Exercise; Adherence to Drugs/Medication, Insulin schedule, and Education, communication and awareness.FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 89We begin our study of dietary management of diabetes by first looking at the main objectives in the management of diabetes. Dietary Management of Diabetes Diet plays a crucial role in the management of diabetes. The main objectives of dietary management of diabetes are to: Attain and maintain ideal/desirable body weight; achieve and maintain normal blood glucose levels; provide adequate nutrition to maintain optimal nutritional status; treat the symptoms; prevent/avoid the acute complications; and achieve optimum blood lipid levels. In general, the nutritional needs of a diabetic are not much different than the needs of a non- diabetic individual. For instance, in the case of a normal healthy individual, the normal diet should provide 60-65% calories from carbohydrates, 20-25% calories from fats and rest (15- 20%) from proteins. A diabetic diet too can follow this distribution but is governed by the present body weight of the patient and the need to maintain the desirable or ideal body weight. Before you review these considerations, it is important for you to understand that carbohydrates and dietary fiber plays a major role in the control of blood glucose. Glycemic index is a guide used to classify carbohydrate containing foods according to their potential to raise the blood sugar level. It is therefore useful in planning diets for diabetics. Read the concept of glycemic index presented in the next section first. Glycemic Index Glycemic index (GI) describes the rise of blood glucose occurring after a meal. In a given meal there can be different foods. It is, therefore, important to know about the extent of rise in blood glucose with a given quantity of a particular food. Different carbohydrates raise blood glucose to variable extent. GI, therefore, gives a ranking of how quickly each carbohydrate-base food or drink makes the blood glucose rise after consuming them, in comparison to the response to an equivalent amount of glucose. A rating of each food between Zero to 100 is provided. Glucose raises the blood sugar levels very quickly and has a GI of 100. In comparison multi-grain chapati has low GI of 27 and is beneficial CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS90for diabetics. GI, therefore, is a useful guide in planning diets for diabetics. Generally, there is no standard way to categorize food based on GI, but for convenience three categories of food based on their GI value can be considered: the high-GI index foods (value>70), intermediate-GI foods (>55 and low-GI foods (<55).

Table 10.3: Foods That can be Used Liberally, Moderately and Best Avoided in the Diet of Diabetic IndividualsCENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS92Diabetes Education: Cornerstone of Diabetes Management Unlike other disease conditions (such as high blood pressure or high cholesterol levels) where medication alone can often successfully treat it; here there are lots of other components to diabetes. Diabetics require day-to-day knowledge of nutrition, exercise, medication, glucose monitoring, psychological and social adjustment etc. Diabetes education therefore, becomes important. Diabetes education means enriching people with knowledge and providing tools crucial for making them active partners in the diabetes management team. People with diabetes need to be educated regarding: The nature of disease, the possibility of development of short term and long term complications, if the condition is not managed appropriately. Self-monitoring skills Appropriate self-care skills Appropriate resources Positive attitude In addition to the list provided in Table 10.3, some do's and don'ts and basic tips are presented in Table 10.4 Make a note of these. Do's Don'ts - Distribute the intake of carbohydrates in accordance with daily needs into 4-5 equal parts (meals).- Avoid refined cereal, flour preparations. - Whole cereals, millets and pulses contain complex carbohydrates; dietary fiber should be preferred to refined carbohydrate-rich foods such as refined flour, sugar, honey etc.- Avoid sweets. - Green leafy vegetables can be given raw or used in soups, curries, dals and chutneys.- Fruit juices may contain high amount of added sugars which are not good for diabetics hence avoided. - Ghee, butter, coconut oil (solid at room temperature) containing saturated fat should be taken in small quantities only.- Avoid eating large meals at one time.FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 93- Vegetable oils, such as sunflower oil, groundnut oil, rice bran oil, soybean oil are recommended for optimal health.- Avoid excessive use of fat in cooking. - Fiber present in vegetables, fenugreek seeds is soluble in nature and is effective in controlling blood glucose levels. Diabetics should consume such foods liberally.- Vanaspati contains saturated fat which increases the risk of heart disease hence should be avoided or restricted. - Wholesome fruits and low-fat milk in moderate amounts may be consumed by diabetics.- Avoid fasting or skipping meals as it may lead to hypoglycemia. - Take vegetables as desired. - Individuals who develop hypoglycemia should immediately be given sugar or glucose and consult a doctor. - Diabetics should do regular exercise (refer to next section for recommendations). - Diabetics are advised to use artificial sweeteners (such as sucralose, saccharine and aspartame) in place of sugar. - Drugs, medication, insulin should be taken as per the advice of the physician.- Alcohol consumption is best avoided as it provides empty calories (does not contain pro - tein or other nutrients). Extra calories from alcohol may make a diabetic overweight/obese. Table 10.4: Do's and Don'ts Physical Activity Guidelines for Indian Population The health benefits of physical activity are well established. Lifestyle intervention studies have shown that Type 2 diabetes and Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) can be prevented with appropriate physical activity and diet. What is appropriate physical activity for the Indian population? The guidelines for adults and children are highlighted herewith: 1. A total of 60 min of physical activity is recommended every day for healthy Asian Indians in view of the high predisposition to develop T2DM and CHD. This should include at least 30 min of moderate-intensity aerobic activity (e.g., brisk walking, jogging, hiking, gardening, bicycling etc.), 15 min of work-related activity (e.g., carrying heavy loads, climbing stairs etc.), and 15 min of muscle-strengthening exercises (such as playing with playground equipment, climbing trees, playing tug-of- war, lifting weights etc.). 2. For children, moderate-intensity physical activity for 60 min daily should be in the form of sports and physical activity. Educate the diabetic patients to follow an appropriate physical activity schedule.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS94EXERCISES Q-1 Differentiate between type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

It is a multifunctional organ that plays an important role in carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism. Most of the end products of digestion of food are transported directly to the liver. Compounds which it synthesizes or stores are sent to other parts of the body when needed. Toxic substances which may enter via food or are produced in other parts of the body are detoxified in liver. Thus, liver has an important place on the nutritional status and diseases of this organ markedly affect health. The function of the liver has been summarised in the table given below: - Protein Metabolism - Synthesis of plasma proteins, carrier proteins like transferrin and coagulation factors. Carbohydrate Metabolism- Synthesis, storage and release of glycogen. Synthesis of heparin, Gluconeogenesis from amino acids, conversion of glucose into fatty acids, interconversion of monosaccharides. Lipid Metabolism - Synthesis of lipoproteins, phospholipids and cholesterol, conversion of fatty acids, carbohydrates and protein intermediates to fat, formation of file, conjugation of bile salts. Mineral and Vitamin Metabolism- Storage of iron, copper etc., large reservoir of vitamin A and Vitamin D, Conversion of blood coagulation factors to prothrombin in the presence of vitamin K, conversion of -carotene to retinol and Vitamin D to its active metabolites. Immunological - Important part of lymphoreticular system. Detoxification - Of bacterial decomposition products, mineral poisons, alcohol and certain drugs like morphine and dyes.UNIT - 03 Chapter 11 HEPATITIS/ JAUNDICE (DEFINITION, CAUSES, PHYSIOLOGICAL CONDITIONS, COMPLICATIONS AND DIETARY MANAGEMENT) Learning Objectives : After reading this chapter the students will be able to: 1. Understand the role of liver in the smooth functioning of the body. 2. Enumerate the risk factors in causation of Jaundice and Hepatitis. 3. Discuss the complications and consequences of Jaundice and Hepatitis. 4. Describe the dietary management and prevention of liver infected diseases.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS96Hepatitis Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver. The condition can be self-limiting or can progress to fibrosis (scarring), cirrhosis or liver cancer. Hepatitis viruses are the most common cause of hepatitis in the world but other infections, toxic substances (e.g. alcohol, certain drugs), and autoimmune diseases can also cause hepatitis. Figure 11.1: Hepatitis and its Types Symptoms & Physiological Conditions I. Causes: Hepatitis A virus (HA V) is present in the faeces of infected persons and is most often transmitted through the consumption of contaminated water and food. Certain sex practices can also spread HA V . Safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent H AV. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is transmitted through exposure to infected blood, semen, and other body fluids. HBV can be transmitted from infected mothers to infants at the time of birth or from family members to infant in early childhood. Transmission may also occur through transfusions of HBV-contaminated blood and blood products, contaminated injections during medical procedures, and through injection drug use. Safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent HBV .FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 97Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is mostly transmitted through exposure to infected blood. This may happen through transfusions of HCV-contaminated blood and blood products, contaminated injections during medical procedures, and through injection drug use. Sexual transmission is also possible but is much less common. There is no vaccine for HCV . Hepatitis D virus (HDV) infections occur only in those who are infected with HBV . The dual infection of HDV and HBV can result in a more critical disease and worse outcomes. Hepatitis B vaccine provides protection from HDV infection. Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is mostly transmitted through the consumption of contaminated water or food. HEV is a common cause of hepatitis outbreaks in developing parts of the world and is increasingly recognized as an important cause of disease specially in developed countries. Safe and effective vaccines to prevent HEV infection have been developed but are not widely available. Initial symptoms of hepatitis caused by infection are like the flu and include: Muscle and joint pain; A high temperature (fever) of 38\u00b0C (100.4F) or above; Feeling unwell; Headache; Occasionally yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice), Symptoms of chronic hepatitis can include: Feeling tired all the time, depression, jaundice, feeling unwell. The period of time between exposure to hepatitis and the onset of the illness is called the incubation period. The incubation period varies depending on the specific hepatitis virus. Hepatitis A virus has an incubation period of about 15 to 45 days; Hepatitis B virus from 45 to 160 days, and Hepatitis C virus from about 2 weeks to 6 months. Many patients infected with HA V , HBV , and HCV have few or no symptoms of illness. The most common symptoms of different types of hepatitis include: Dark urine (hepatitis A, B, C); stomach pain (hepatitis B, C); yellow skin or eye whites, called jaundice (hepatitis A, B, C); pale or clay-coloured stool (hepatitis A, C); low-grade fever (hepatitis A, B, C); loss of appetite (hepatitis A, B, C);CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS98 fatigue (hepatitis A, B, C); feeling sick to your stomach (hepatitis A, B, C); aching joints (hepatitis B). II. Preventions Prevention and control measures that can be adopted are listed below:- Control of reservoir:- It is very difficult to achieve this because of poor sanitary facilities of the community and no specific treatment available to kill the virus. Control of transmission:- Spread of the infection can be controlled by maintaining strict personal hygiene, e.g. thorough hand washing with soap before eating and after going to the toilet; sanitary disposal of sewage to prevent contamination of drinking water and eatable. Control of susceptible population:- Susceptible population groups may seek medical advice for suitable control measures. Certain protective measures are available for specific susceptible groups and individuals at risk. Administration of vaccine:- The other control measure is the vaccine. Vaccines against infective hepatitis have been developed but are still in clinical trial stages and it may take some more time before they are widely used in the prevention of this disease. Management of Hepatitis & Dietetics: The majority of the patients with Hepatitis do not require drastic interventions. It is advisable to encourage patients to consume a normal diet. However, patients consuming alcohol are mostly malnourished and hence require serious nutritional interventions. Nutritional Management The objective of nutritional management of hepatitis are: i) To relieve symptoms; ii) To aid in the regeneration of liver tissues; iii) To prevent further liver damage. A high protein, high carbohydrate and moderate fat diet is recommended. Small attractive meals at regular intervals are better tolerated. Overfeeding should be avoided.FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 991. Proteins:- For the liver cells to regenerate an adequate supply of proteins is needed. With severe jaundice, 40 g, while in mild jaundice 60-80 g of protein is permitted. 2. Fats:- Fats make the food more palatable and increase calorie intake. In severe jaundice 20 g and in moderate jaundice 20-30 g of fats per day are recommended. In other cases of jaundice, fat needs to be restricted only if there is an obstruction to fat digestion and produces fatty diarrhea. 3. Carbohydrates:- High carbohydrates content in the diet is essential to supply enough calories so that tissue protein are not broken down for energy purpose. When fever, nausea and vomiting are present, intravenous glucose is suggested. As soon as the patient can take oral feeds; intravenous feeding should be stopped and fruit juices, sugar, jaggery and honey are given not only to provide carbohydrates but also to supply an adequate amount of electrolytes. 4. Vitamins:- They are essential to regenerate liver cells. 500 mg of vitamin C, 10 mg of vitamin K and supplements of B complex are essential to meet the daily needs. If anorexia, nausea or vomiting is there, the vitamins may be given by injection. 5. Minerals:- If food is not taken orally then a careful watch should be kept on the sodium and potassium levels. Oral feeds of fruit juice, vegetable and meat soups with added salt, given orally or through a nasogastric tube help in maintaining the electrolyte balance. Normal levels of sodium and potassium in the body fluids should be maintained through supplements. 6. Foods included:- Cereal porridge, soft chapattis, bread rice, skimmed milk, tapioca, potato, yam, fruit, fruit juices, sugar, jaggery, honey, biscuits, soft custard without butter cream and non-stimulant beverages.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS100Sample Menu Meal Menu Amount Early Morning Tea with sugar Glucose Biscuit1 Cup (150 ml) with 3 tsp. 2 No. Breakfast Cornflakes/ Wheat flakes with milk and honey (High Carbohydrate) Swiss rolls (sponge cake with jam) Fruit (apple, papaya, orange) Mango Juice \u00bd big Bowl (30gm) with 150 ml and 3 tsp honey 2 rolls 1 No. (150 gm) 1 Glass (250 ml) 10:00 am Coconut water 1 Glass (250ml) Midmorning Aloo paneer chat Roohafza water1 Bowl cooked 1 Glass (250 ml) Lunch Chapati Rice Seasonal Vegetable (min. oil) Dal (min. oil) Curd Rasgulla Oil2 No. 1\u00bd Bowl 1 Bowl cooked 1 Bowl cooked 1 Bowl 2 No. 1 - 1\u00bd Evening Tea Banana shake with ice cream Channa1 Glass (250 ml) 1 Bowl (50 gms) Dinner Chapati Rice Dal (minimum oil) Seasonal Vegetable (minimum oil) Curd Petha (Indian Dessert) Oil2 No. 1\u00bd Bowl cooked 1 Bowl cooked 1 Bowl cooked 1 Bowl 2 No. 1-1\u00bd tsp.

Jaundice is a common symptom for all liver diseases. It results due to increase levels of bilirubin in the blood. Jaundice is clinically detected when the bilirubin level is above 2.0 to 2.5 mg/dl. (Normal level 0.2 to 0.8 mg/dl). Table 11.2: Liver Function Clinical Symptoms and Physiological Conditions: I. Causes: Damage to liver cells leads to an increase in bilirubin resulting in jaundice. After 120 days of life, RBC's are broken and through a complex chemical reaction, bilirubin is produced. This is excreted in stools and urine along with bile. Problems like increased destruction of RBC, decreased functioning of the liver or obstruction to the flow of bile from the liver can result in jaundice. The figure below shows the production of jaundice. Other causes of jaundice are pernicious anaemia and certain diseases affecting the liver such as typhoid, malaria, yellow fever and tuberculosis.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS102 Figure 11.3: Yellow Pigmentation of the Skin Figure 11.4: Discoloration of Eyes Common symptoms of jaundice include: a yellow pigmentation of the skin and the whites of the eyes, normally starting at the head and spreading down the body; pale stools; dark yellow or brown, DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 103Types of Jaundice There are three types of jaundice namely: 1. Hemolytic Jaundice It is also known as prehepatic jaundice. This relates to excessive destruction of RBC resulting in an increased bilirubin formation and anaemia. There is increased unconjugated plasma bilirubin, which is excreted through the urine. This kind of jaundice is common in newborns, i.e. neonatal jaundice. 2. Hepatic Jaundice In this, there is a normal bilirubin production. The liver cannot convert fat soluble bilirubin to the water-soluble form. Hence, there is a decreased conjugation leading to hepatocyte damage (jaundice). Failure of about 80% or more of hepatic function is observed. 3. Obstructive Jaundice It is referred to as post - hepatic jaundice. This results from the interference of normal flow of bile into the duodenum due to stones, tumors or inflammation of the mucosa of the duct. This results in a backflow of bile into the bloodstream and is circulated in the body giving a yellow color. Management of Jaundice & Dietetics To remove excess bilirubin a generous intake of water is necessary. Hence the requirement is of more than 3-4 litres per day. Thus, initially when jaundice is diagnosed preference should be given to a clear liquid diet every two hours. This reduces the load on liver. Clear liquid includes fruit juices, dal or rice water, vegetable stalk, vegetable soup or chicken broth. Once the patient tolerates this without any nausea or vomiting, start with a full liquid diet. This includes buttermilk, yogurt smoothie, liquid mixture of dal and rice or curd and rice or liquid porridge. Within a day or two, start with soft easy diet which is easy to digest and very low in fat. Water intake must be over 3 litres throughout the course of jaundice. Soft khichadi, porridge, curd rice and upma should be good. Be generous with carbohydrates, as it is required to build liver cells. Avoid any oil as it is processed in the liver, which is already compromised due to jaundice. Coconut oil or ghee can be used sparingly (1 - 2 teaspoon/day).CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS104Foods that can be used liberally Foods to be avoided 1.Sugarcane:- Sugarcane has simple sugars that help rebuild liver cells. Chewing the sugarcane helps in removing the bile through the body. Or even sugarcane juice will help. Just ensure the juice is hygienic. Drink juice twice daily for better results.1. Spicy and fried foods. 2.Banana:- Banana is high in antioxidants and potassium. Both help in flushing out toxins from the liver. Crush ripe banana, add some honey and take this at least twice a day for good results.2. Junk foods. Liver needs to produce more bile to digest these foods and that may aggravate the condition. 3.Buttermilk:- Buttermilk is light to digest. It has probiotics that are required for normal gastrointestinal function. Having buttermilk at least thrice a day is advisable.3. Alcohol, coffee and tea add more toxins to the liver. 4.Tomato juice:- Tomatoes contain vitamin C and potassium which helps in detoxifying the liver. 4. Non-pasteurized milk is high in microbes. 5.Lemon:- Lemon is high in antioxidants. It protects liver cells from further damage as it unblocks the bile duct from accumulated bile fluid. 5. Pulses and legumes. 6.Gooseberry:- Gooseberry is rich in vitamin C that alleviates the symptoms of jaundice.6. Non Vegetarian food as it involves liver for it metabolism. 7.Barley:- Barley has diuretic property. It helps to remove all toxins and bile from body through urine. 8.Wheat grass:- Wheat grass triggers the enzymes involved in rejuvenating the liver cells. While juice of Wheat grass is very effective in normal functioning of liver.

Some common malabsorption syndromes are Celiac disease, Lactose Intolerance. Celiac Disease Celiac disease often called gluten-sensitive enteropathy is a serious autoimmune disease that occurs in genetically predisposed people where the ingestion of gluten leads to damage in the small intestine. It is estimated to affect 1 in 100 people worldwide. Figure 12.1: Inflammation in Small IntestineUNIT - 03 Chapter 12 CELIAC DISEASE, LACTOSE INTOLERANCE & PEPTIC ULCER (DEFINITION, CAUSES, CLINICAL SYMPTOMS AND DIETARY MANAGEMENT) Learning Objectives : After reading this chapter, the students will be able to: 1. Define Celiac disease, Lactose Intolerance & Peptic ulcer. 2. Explain the causes, clinical symptoms, complications of the above mentioned diseases. 3. Describe the treatment and prevention with a main focus on diet therapy and its management.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS106Causes Symptoms & Physiological Conditions Causes: Celiac disease is caused by an abnormal immune system reaction to the protein gluten, which is found in foods such as bread, pasta, cereals and biscuits. In the case of celiac disease the immune system mistakes one of the substances that makes up gluten, called gliadin, as a threat to the body. The antibodies that are produced cause the surface of intestine to become inflamed (red and swollen). The surface of the intestine is usually covered with millions of tiny tube-shaped outgrowths called villi. Villi increase the surface area of gut and help it to digest food more effectively. However, in celiac disease, the damage and inflammation to the lining of the gut flattens the villi, reducing its ability to help with digestion. Symptoms The signs and symptoms of celiac disease can vary greatly and differ in children and adults. Digestive signs and symptoms for adults include: Diarrhea Fatigue Weight loss Bloating and gas Abdominal pain Nausea and vomiting Constipation However, more than half the adults with celiac disease have signs and symptoms unrelated to the digestive system, including: Anaemia, usually from iron deficiency; loss of bone density (osteoporosis) or softening of bone (osteomalacia); itchy, blistery skin rash; mouth ulcers; headaches and fatigue; nervous system injury, including numbness and tingling in the feet and hands, possible problems with balance, and cognitive impairment;FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 107 joint pain; reduced functioning of the spleen. Physiological conditions: Children suffering with celiac disease often will experience a decline in both height and weight growth velocity, resulting in a decrease in the growth percentiles. Adults have diarrhea as a major symptom of celiac disease in approximately 50% of cases. They may also be diagnosed in the setting of anemia or osteoporosis. Complications Chronic and severe forms of celiac disease patients are at risk for several complications. These complications are following: Anaemia Dermatitis, herpetiformis Vitamin D deficiency, inadequate calcium absorption Vitamin K deficiency Infertility, increased risk of abortion, delayed puberty, delayed growth Management of Celiac Disease And Dietetics Treatment: At present, the only effective treatment is a lifelong gluten-free diet. No medication exists that prevents damage or prevents the body from attacking the gut when gluten is present in the diet. Strict adherence to the diet helps the intestine to heal, leading to resolution of all symptoms in most cases and, depending on how soon the diet is begun, can also eliminate the heightened risk of osteoporosis and intestinal cancer and in few cases sterility. The diet can be cumbersome; failure to comply with the diet may cause relapse. Dietitian input is generally requested to ensure that the person is aware which foods contain gluten, which foods are safe, and how to have a balanced diet despite the limitations. Gluten- free products are usually more expensive and harder to find than common gluten-containing foods. The term \"gluten-free\" is generally used to indicate a supposed harmless level of gluten rather than a complete absence. The exact level at which gluten is harmless is uncertain. Gluten-free diet improves health-related quality of life, and strict adherence to the diet gives more benefit than incomplete adherence.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS108Dietary Guidelines in Celiac Disease: Avoiding foods with gluten, a protein found naturally in wheat, rye, and barley is important in treating celiac disease. Removing gluten from diet will improve symptoms, heal damage to the small intestine, and prevent further damage over time. Many healthy, gluten-free foods and products are available in the market. Foods such as meat, fish, fruits, vegetables, rice, and potatoes without additives or seasonings do not contain gluten and are part of a well-balanced diet. Gluten-free types of bread, pasta, and other foods are now easier to find in stores and at special food companies. Potato, rice, soy, amaranth, quinoa, buckwheat, or bean flour instead of wheat flour can be substituted in the diet of a celiac patient.

Lactose Intolerance Lactose Intolerance: It is the inability to digest lactose, a component of milk and some other dairy products. The basis for lactose intolerance is the lack of an enzyme called lactase in the small intestine. The most common symptoms of lactose intolerance are diarrhea, bloating, and gas. Symptoms & Physiological Conditions Causes There are two main types of lactose intolerance, which have different causes.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS110Primary Lactose Intolerance: Primary lactose intolerance is the most common. It is caused by a decrease in lactase production with the age, so that lactose is poorly absorbed in the body . Secondary Lactose Intolerance: This form of lactose intolerance occurs when your small intestine decreases lactase production after an illness, injury or surgery involving your small intestine. Among the diseases associated with secondary lactose intolerance are celiac disease, bacterial overgrowth and Crohn's disease. Another cause of lactase deficiency is secondary lactase deficiency. This type of deficiency is due to diseases that destroy the lining of the small intestine along with the enzyme lactase. An example of such a disease is celiac disease (sprue). Congenital or Developmental Lactose Intolerance: It is possible, but rare, for babies to be born with lactose intolerance caused by a complete absence of lactase activity. This disorder is passed from generation to generation in a pattern of inheritance called autosomal recessive, meaning that both the mother and the father must pass on the same gene variant for a child to be affected. Premature infants may also have lactose intolerance because of an insufficient lactase level. Lactase deficiency may occur because of a congenital absence (absent from birth) of lactase due to a mutation in the gene that is responsible for producing the enzyme lactase. This is a very rare cause of lactase deficiency, and the symptoms of this type of lactase deficiency begin shortly after birth. Symptoms- A person with lactose intolerance will experience symptoms after consuming milk or some dairy product that contains lactose. Symptoms can range from mild discomfort to a severe reaction, depending on how much lactase the person produces, and how much dairy products they consume. Symptoms include: Flatulence Bloating Abdominal pains Nausea DiarrheaFOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 111The person may have a sudden urge to use the bathroom 1 to 2 hours after consuming lactose. In severe cases, dehydration may occur. The most common cause of lactase deficiency is a decrease in the amount of lactase that occurs after childhood and persists into adulthood, referred to as adult-type hypolactasia. This decrease in lactase is genetically programmed. Management of Lactose Intolerance and Dietetics Treatment: There is currently no way to boost the body's production of lactase, but one can adopt the following measures to avoid the discomfort of lactose intolerance by: Avoiding large servings of milk and other dairy products; Including small servings of dairy products in your regular meals; Eating and drinking lactose-reduced ice cream and milk; Experimenting with an assortment of dairy products. Not all dairy products have the same amount of lactose. For example, hard cheeses, such as Swiss or cheddar, have small amounts of lactose and generally cause no symptoms; Buying lactose-reduced or lactose-free products; Using lactase enzyme tablets or drops. Tablets or drops containing the lactase enzyme (Dairy Ease, Lactaid, others) may help digest dairy products. Not everyone with lactose intolerance is helped by these products. Reducing the intake of dairy products doesn't mean that we can't get enough calcium. Calcium is found in many other foods, such as: Broccoli Calcium-fortified products, such as bread and juices Milk substitutes, such as soy milk and rice milk Oranges Pinto beans Spinach Also, make sure to get enough vitamin D, which is typically supplied in fortified milk. Eggs, liver and yogurt also contain vitamin D, and the body makes vitamin D in the sun. Even without restricting dairy foods, though, many adults don't get enough vitamin D.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS112Dietary tips for Planning a Menu for Lactose Intolerance Patient Avoid milk, paneer and milk-based beverages or desserts. All the food labels should be read before use, as they should be lactose-free. If a nutrition supplement is given it should be lactose-free. Peptic Ulcers A peptic ulcer is a sore on the lining of the stomach or duodenum. Rarely, a peptic ulcer may develop just above stomach in the oesophagus called as an oesophageal ulcer. Figure 12.4: Stomach and Duodenum with Ulcer Symptoms & Physiological Conditions Causes Long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as Aspirin and Ibuprofen; An infection with the bacteria called as Helicobacter pylori; Rare cancerous and noncancerous tumours in the stomach, duodenum, or pancreas also known as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES); Peptic ulcers occur when acid in the digestive tract corrodes the inner surface of the stomach or small intestine. The acid can create a painful open sore that may FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 113bleed. The digestive tract is coated with a mucous layer that normally protects against acid. But if the amount of acid is increased or the amount of mucus is decreased, it could develop into an ulcer. Some other causes include: A bacterium, Helicobacter pylori commonly lives in the mucous layer that covers and protects tissues that line the stomach and small intestine. Often, the H. pylori bacterium causes no problems, but it can cause inflammation of the stomach's inner layer, producing an ulcer. Regular use of certain pain relievers: Taking Aspirin, as well as certain nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), can irritate or inflame the lining of the stomach and small intestine. Peptic ulcers are more common in older adults who take these pain medications frequently or in people who take these medications for osteoarthritis. Other medications: Taking certain other medications along with NSAIDs, such as steroids, anticoagulants, low-dose aspirin can greatly increase the chance of developing ulcers. It is not uncommon for people to have a peptic ulcer with no symptoms at all. However, one of the most common symptoms of peptic ulcers is indigestion-like pain. The pain may occur anywhere from the belly button to the breastbone. It can be brief or may last for hours. It is more severe when the stomach is empty or right after eating (depending on where it is located); sometimes it is worse during sleep. Eating certain foods may relieve it, and some foods may make it even worse. Other symptoms may include: Difficulty swallowing food; Food that is eaten comes back up; Feeling unwell after eating; Weight loss; Loss of appetite. Over-the-counter medications can often provide relief for these symptoms. Rarely, ulcers can cause severe signs and symptoms, such as: V omiting blood; Black and tarry stools, or stools with dark red blood; Nausea and vomiting that is especially persistent and severe.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS114Management of Peptic Ulcer & Dietetics Treatment:- The type of treatment usually depends on what caused the peptic ulcer. Treatment will focus on either lowering stomach acid levels so that the ulcer can heal, or eradicating the H. pylori infection. H. pylori infection treatment Patients infected with H. pylori will usually need antibiotics. This treatment is effective in most patients, and the ulcer will start to disappear within days. When treatment is over, the individual will have to be tested again to make sure the H. pylori have gone. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs If the ulcer comes from NSAIDs, the patient will have to stop taking them. If the person cannot stop taking NSAIDs, the doctor may minimize the dosage and review the patient's need for them later. Follow-up treatment Even after the ulcer has healed and treatment has been completed, the patient may still have indigestion. In such cases, the doctor might advise some diet and lifestyle modifications. In severe cases with bleeding, an endoscopy may be needed to stop the bleeding at the ulcer site. Dietary Management: Dietary changes can be important for treating and preventing peptic ulcers. It is important to avoid foods and flavourings that induce the stomach to produce acids, such as chili powder, garlic, black pepper, and caffeine. Alcohol has the same effect on the stomach and should also be avoided. The diet should contain plenty of foods that provide plenty of vitamin A and fibre that dissolves and digests easily. These can include: Sources of soluble fibre Oats ApplesFOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 115 Oranges Carrots Legumes Flax seeds Nuts Barley Sources of vitamin A Liver Broccoli Kale Spinach Sweet potatoes Foods that are high in antioxidants, such as a range of berries and snap peas, are recommended. Green tea has also demonstrated a restrictive effect on the growth of H. pylori under laboratory conditions. A balanced diet filled with fruits and vegetables and lacking in intense spices and flavours should assist with a pe ptic ulcer.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS116Meal Menu Amount Early Morning Coconut water (no tea) Biscuit1 Glass 2 No. Breakfast Suji Upma/ Idli (less spicy) Banana Apple Juice1 Bowl/ 2 No. 1 No. 1 Glass Mid-morning Butter Milk 1 Glass Lunch Khichri Soft Vegetables (lauki/ tinda/ pumpkin/ potato) Washed dal (without husk) Curd Cooking oil1 Big Bowl 1 Bowl cooked 1 Bowl cooked 1 Bowl 1-1\u00bd tsp Evening Tea Cold Milk Biscuit1 Cup 2 No. Dinner Boiled rice Soft Vegetables (lauki/ tinda/ pumpkin/ potato) Washed dal (without husk) Curd Cooking oil1 Big Bowl 1 Bowl cooked 1 Bowl cooked 1 Bowl 1-1\u00bd tsp Table 12.5: Sample Menu in Peptic Ulcer Chart) EXERCISES Q-1 What is malabsorption syndrome?

A food hazard generally refers to any agent with the potential to cause adverse health consequences for consumers. It occurs when food is exposed to hazardous agents which results in contamination of that food. HACCP (Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point) is a food safety system that is recognised worldwide to determine significant hazards pertaining to specific products and processes. Food hazards may be biological, chemical and physical. Let's now discuss these hazards in detail.Chapter 13 FOOD HAZARDS Learning Objectives : After reading this chapter, the students will be able to: 1. Explain the term food hazards. 2. Differentiate between different types of food hazards (physical, chemical & biological). 3. Explain the causes, concepts and preventive measures of cholera, typhoid & salmonellosis.UNIT - 04 CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS1201. Biological hazards: It includes microorganisms such as viruses, bacteria, yeasts, molds and parasites. Some of these are pathogens or may produce toxins. A pathogenic microorganism causes disease and can vary in degree of severity. Examples of biological hazards include Salmonella, E. coli and Clostridium botulinum . These hazards can arise from raw materials or from food-processing steps used to make the final product. Microorganisms are present everywhere: air, dirt, fresh and salt water, skin, hair, animal fur and plants. Microorganisms are further classified into various groups. Since microorganisms are so prevalent, it is important to understand when to be concerned about them and how to deal with them. Although thousands of kinds of microorganisms exist, only a few pose hazards to humans. Many microorganisms are beneficial to us. Certain kinds of yeast, molds and bacteria help make cheese, sour cream, yogurt and other fermented dairy products. Particular kinds of yeast are used in making beer, wine and other fermented beverages. We add these microorganisms to our foods intentionally, and they cause no harm. In fact, studies show that some of these microorganisms contribute to good health. In HACCP, \"hazards\" refer to conditions or contaminants in foods that can cause illness or injury. 2. Chemical hazards: It varies in the aspect of production they are related to. Some potential chemical hazards could be prior to a processor receiving product, such as the antimicrobial residues or improper use of pesticides. Others could be chemicals used on processing equipment such as oils used on equipment or sanitizers. Also, other potential chemical hazards may include substances that are safe or used in processing at certain levels but can cause illness or injury if consumed at too high of a concentration, such as sodium nitrite or antimicrobial solutions used in intervention steps. The HACCP team assesses the hazard analysis and the likelihood of the chemical to cause injury or illness. Chemical contamination can take place at any stage in food production and processing. Chemicals can be helpful and are deliberately used with some foods, such as pesticides on fruits and vegetables. Packaging materials that are in direct contact with ingredients or the products can be a source of incidental chemicals, such as sanitizers or inks. Chemicals are not hazardous if properly used or controlled. 3. Physical hazards: It includes objects that are sharp or hard such as stones, glass, metal, plastic, pits, wood, or even a bone. Physical hazards can lead to injuries such as choking, cuts, or broken teeth. Some foreign material in food products may not be a physical hazard but rather an unwanted foreign material such as hair, insects, or sand that are not likely to cause injuries. Physical hazards include any potentially harmful extraneous matter FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 121which is not normally found in food. When a consumer unknowingly eats the foreign material or object, it is likely to cause choking, injury or other adverse health effects. Physical hazards are the most commonly reported consumer complaints because the injury occurs immediately or soon after eating, and the source of the hazard is often easy to identify. Food Borne Disease Food borne illness usually results from a few of the following reasons: 1. Consumption of food obtained from infected plants or animals. 2. Food that is contaminated by insects, flies, rodents, etc. 3. Food that comes in the contact with sewage water or sewage polluted water. 4. Food which is handled in an unhygienic way. Microorganisms like salmonella, clostridium and staphylococci are a major cause for the majority of food-borne illness. The main diseases which are transmitted by food are typhoid, dysentery, tuberculosis, infectious hepatitis and cholera. Some of the common symptoms of food illness are given below as food-borne illness generally affects the gastrointestinal tract. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain & diarrhea. Food and Personal Hygiene: Hygiene is the most important factor in order to prevent food illness. It is so because food is the most potent medium through which disease- carrying organisms can be transmitted. So, it is very important for food handlers to follow the high standard of food hygiene. Hence, one should follow the following practices: 1. Wash your hands with soap or water. Dry them properly with a towel or a hand dryer. 2. Keep your nails short and clean. 3. If you have cut or wounds on hands or fingers, cover them with proper dressing before handling food. 4. Do not touch hair, nose or any other potentially hazardous area or thing while preparing food. 5. Cover your mouth and nose while coughing and sneezing. 6. Store the food at the proper temperature.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS122Cholera: Cholera is referred to an acute infection of the small intestine that causes severe watery diarrhea, which can lead to dehydration and can even cause death, if untreated. It is caused by eating food or drinking water that is contaminated with a bacterium called Vibrio cholerae . Cholera has been known and feared for centuries because of its occurrence in epidemics resulting in high mortality and social disruption. Figure 13.2: Transmission of Cholera Causes: Vibrio cholerae is usually found in food or water contaminated by faces from a person with the infection. Common sources include: Municipal water supplies; Ice made from municipal water; Foods and drinks sold by street vendors; Vegetables are grown with water containing human wastes; Raw or undercooked fish and seafood caught in waters polluted with sewage. Incubation period: The incubation period for cholera infection is from few hours to 5 days, but commonly it is 1 to 2 days.FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 123Carriers in cholera: A carrier is a person who is apparently healthy but is excreting the causative organism - Vibrio cholerae . Who gets the disease? Age & Sex: Cholera affects all ages and both sexes. In areas, where cholera is endemic, children are affected the most. Economic Status: Cholera occurs mostly in the low socio-economic groups mainly because of poor hygiene. Immunity: Affected person gets temporary immunity from previous episodes for future attacks. Such immunity will however be effective from 10 days to 7 months only after the onset of an attack. Symptoms Watery diarrhea V omiting Dehydration Rapid heart rate Loss of skin elasticity (the ability to return to original position quickly if pinched) Dry mucous membranes, including the inside of the mouth, throat, nose and eyelids Low blood pressure Thirst Reduce urine output Muscle cramps Management, Prevention and Measures Management: Since dehydration is the most common manifestation of cholera the very first step in the management of cholera is control of dehydration. With rehydration i.e., by making up of losses, fluids and salts (electrolytes) cholera can now be effectively treated. The rehydration can be oral or intravenous. By this treatment, the death rate due to cholera can be reduced to 1 percent. World Health Organisation recommends the use of oral fluid.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS124The amount of oral fluid given depends upon the extent of dehydration. In case a person has mild dehydration i.e., the patient is thirsty, a pulse is normal, tongue moist, skin pinch retracts immediately, the volume of oral fluid to be given would be 50ml per kg body weight to be consumed within 4 hours. In case a person has moderate dehydration i.e., when the patient is thirsty, pulse is rapid and weak, eyes are sunken and tongue is dry, the volume of oral fluid to be given should be 100 ml per kg body weight to be consumed within 4 hours. In case a person has severe dehydration i.e., when the patient is drowsy, cold, sweaty, pulse is feeble, blood pressure not recordable and skin pinch retracts very slowly, the tongue is very dry, the patient must immediately be shifted to a nearby hospital. Prevention and Control Sanitation measure- 1. Water control: As water is the most important cause of transmission of cholera, adequate steps must be taken for a safe and adequate water supply . 2. Excreta disposal: Economical and effective excreta disposal must be undertaken. 3. Food sanitation: As food forms an important vehicle of infection, effective steps must be taken for proper food sanitation. 4. Disinfections: Cresol and bleaching powder are the most effective disinfectants. The patients stools, vomit, clothes and other items that have been contaminated must be disinfected. 5. Vaccination: Vaccination against cholera as a specific prophylactic (medicine to prevent cholera) is available. Children below 5 yrs. who are the main victims of cholera in endemic areas are poorly protected with the current vaccine, the degree of protection tends to increase with age. Typhoid Typhoid is referred to a bacterial infection that can cause high fever, diarrhea, and vomiting. Typhoid fever is a systemic infection caused by Salmonella typhi, usually through ingestion of contaminated food or water. It occurs predominantly in association with poor sanitation and lack of clean potable water. Typhoid is manifested by fever with the gradual onset of headache, prolonged fever associated with anorexia. Non-sweating fever, mental dullness may be observed sometimes.FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 125 Figure 13.3: Transmission of Typhoid Causes: The causative organism is a microorganism named Salmonella typhi and mainly it affects the intestine and liberates toxins into blood circulation. The main mode of infection is by the faecal-oral route. The typhoid infection is mainly spread by water and food contaminated by faeces or urine of people suffering from typhoid or carriers of the disease. There are certain social factors that contribute to the infection. These include: 1. The prevailing wrong defecation practices because of which faecal pollution of soil occurs leading to spread of infection through water, food and flies; 2. Low standard of personal hygiene; 3. Unhygienic health practices; 4. Low standards of the food hygiene; 5. Illiteracy and health ignorance. Carriers in Typhoid: A small number who have suffered from typhoid may become carriers. The carriers may excrete the organism in faeces, urine or bile. Incubation period: The disease takes usually 2 weeks with a range of 4 days to 3 weeks.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS126Period of communicability: The period of communicability for typhoid lasts as long as typhoid bacilli appear in the excreta. Generally, everybody is susceptible to the disease typhoid. Resistance to small infecting doses follows recovery from clinical disease or from unapparent (sub- clinical) infection or from active immunization. In areas where typhoid is endemic, attack rates usually decline with age. Management, Prevention and Measures Three lines of measures can be described against the control and prevention of typhoid fever. They are: 1. Control of Reservoir: The reservoir of infection for typhoid fever exists in patients, contacts and carriers. Isolation of cases is essential to prevent the spread of the infection. Accurate and appropriate treatment should be provided through proper medical care. Since the patient's stools, urine and his/her articles are the main sources of infection in typhoid fever, they should be properly disinfected. 2. Control of Sanitation: Following measures are included: Protection, purification and chlorination of public water supplies; Sanitary disposal of human excreta; Control of fly breeding; Boiling or pasteurisation of milk and dairy products; Identification and adequate supervision of typhoid carriers. 3. Immunization: Vaccine is available for immunization against typhoid fever. While improved sanitation and strict domestic and personal hygiene are primary in preventing typhoid, immunization has a complimentary role. Though, immunization does not offer 100 percent protection against typhoid, it has got a major role in prevention. Management In case of any prolonged fever, it is essential to seek proper medical attention. Once the diagnosis of the disease is confirmed clinically and bacteriologically (biochemically) appropriate treatment should be administered under strict medical care. One must make sure that medical treatment for typhoid should be availed under strict medical care. Proper nutrition and dietary care should be taken since the gastro-intestinal system is involved. Authentic advice from qualified medical people should be obtained.FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 127Salmonellosis Salmonella infection (salmonellosis) is referred to a common bacterial disease that affects the intestinal tract. Salmonella bacteria typically live in animal and human intestines and are shed through faeces. Humans catch the infection most frequently through contaminated water or food. Typically, people suffering from salmonella infection have no symptoms. Others develop diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps within 8 to 72 hours. Most healthy people recover within a few days without any specific treatment. In some cases, the diarrhea associated with a salmonella infection can be so dehydrating as to require prompt medical attention. Life-threatening complications may also develop if the infection spreads beyond the intestines. The risk of acquiring salmonella infection is higher if one travels to countries with poor sanitation. Causes: Salmonella bacteria stays in the intestines of people, animals and birds. Most people are infected with salmonella by eating foods that have been contaminated by faeces. Commonly infected foods include: Raw meat, poultry and seafood. Faeces may grow onto raw meat and poultry during the butchering process. Seafood may be contaminated if harvested from contaminated water. Raw eggs. While an egg's shell may seem to be a perfect barrier to contamination, some infected chickens produce eggs that contain salmonella before the shell is even formed. Raw eggs are used in homemade versions of mayonnaise and hollandaise sauce. Fruits and vegetables. Some fresh produce, particularly imported varieties, may be hydrated in the field or washed during processing with water contaminated with salmonella. Contamination can occur in the kitchen, when juices from raw meat and poultry come into contact with uncooked foods, such as salads. Management, Prevention and Measures Preventive methods are important especially when preparing food or providing care for infants, older adults and people who have weakened immune systems. It is very important to cook food thoroughly and refrigerate or freeze food promptly . Wash your hands Washing your hands thoroughly can help prevent the transfer of salmonella bacteria to your mouth or to any food you are preparing. Wash your hands after you:CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS128 Use the toilet; Change a diaper; Handle raw meat or poultry; Clean up pet faeces; Touch reptiles or birds. Keep things separate To prevent cross-contamination: Store raw meat, poultry and seafood away from other foods in your refrigerator; If possible, have two cutting boards in your kitchen - one for raw meat and the other for fruits and vegetables; Never place cooked food on an unwashed plate that previously held raw meat. Avoid eating raw eggs Cookie dough, homemade ice cream and eggnog all contain raw eggs. If you consume raw eggs, make sure they've been pasteurized. EXERCISES Q-1 Explain the term food hazards. List its three types. Q-2 Write a brief note on cholera. Q-3 Comment on the management and prevention of typhoid. Q-4 Discuss the cause and preventive measures of salmonellosis.FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 129The human body provides places for disease-causing germs and parasites to grow and multiply. These places include the skin and in and around the openings to the body. It is less likely that germs and parasites will get inside the body if people have good personal hygiene habits. Maintaining personal hygiene is very important for more than one reason; social, health, personal, psychological or just as a way of life. Maintaining a good standard of hygiene will help keep infections, illnesses and bad odors at bay. The importance of hygiene should be taught from an early age to help encourage and inculcate good habits. Personal hygiene can be defined as an act of maintaining cleanliness and grooming of the external body. Maintaining good personal hygiene consists of bathing, washing your hands, brushing your teeth and sporting clean clothing. Additionally, it is also about making safe and hygienic decisions when you are around others. One of the most foolproof ways to safeguard yourself and others from illness is through good personal hygiene. This means cleaning your hands, especially, but additionally your body. Good personal hygiene not only enhances your overall appearance, but its importance is also directly related to the prevention of diseases, infections, and unpleasant odours. Good Personal Hygiene Good personal hygiene habits include: Washing the body often. If possible, everybody must have a shower or a bath every day. However, there may be times when this is not possible, for example, when people are out camping or there is a shortage of water; If this happens, a swim or a thorough wash all over the body with a wet sponge or cloth will do;Chapter 14 PERSONAL HYGIENE & FOOD HYGIENE Learning Objectives : After reading this chapter, the students will be able to: 1. Explain the terms food hygiene, food safety & food sanitation. 2. Enumerate the scope of environmental sanitation. 3. List the various habits included in maintenance of personal hygiene.UNIT - 04CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS130 Cleaning the teeth at least once a day. Brushing the teeth after each meal is the best way of making sure that gum disease and tooth decay are avoided. It is very important to clean teeth after breakfast and immediately before going to bed; Washing the hair with soap or shampoo at least once a week; Washing hands with soap after going to the toilet; Washing hands with soap before preparing and/or eating food. During normal daily activities, such as working and playing, disease-causing germs may get onto the hands and under the nails. If the germs are not washed off before preparing food or eating, they may get onto the food; Changing into clean clothes. Dirty clothes should be washed with laundry soap before wearing them again; Hanging clothes in the sun to dry. The sun's rays will kill some disease-causing germs and parasites; Turning away from other people and covering the nose and mouth with a tissue or the hand when coughing or sneezing. If this is not done, droplets of liquid containing germs from the nose and mouth will be spread in the air and other people can breathe them in, or the droplets can get onto food. Types of Personal Hygiene Every individual's idea of personal hygiene differs. These main categories are a useful place to start for building good hygiene habits: Toilet Hygiene Wash your hands after you use the restroom. Rub your hands with soap for 20 to 30 seconds, and be sure to clean between your fingers, on the back of your hands, and under your nails. Rinse with warm water, and dry them with a clean towel. If you don't have running water or soap, an alcohol-based hand sanitizer will also work. Use the one that contains at least 60 percent alcohol. Shower Hygiene The personal choice may dictate how often you wish to shower, but most people will benefit from a rinse at least every other day. Showering with soap helps rinse away dead skin cells, bacteria, and oils. You must also wash your hair at least twice a week. Shampooing your hair and scalp helps remove skin build-up and protects against oily residues that can irritate your skin.FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 131Nail Hygiene Trim your nails on regular basis to keep them short and clean. Brush under them with a nail brush or washcloth to rinse away buildup, dirt, and germs. Tidying your nails helps you prevent the spreading of germs into your mouth and other body openings. You should also avoid biting your nails. Teeth Hygiene Good dental hygiene is about more than just having pearly white teeth. Caring for your teeth and gums is a smart way to prevent gum diseases and cavities. Brush at least twice a day for 2 minutes. Aim to brush after you wake up and before bed. If you can, brush after every meal, too. Floss between your teeth daily, and ask your dentist about using an antibacterial mouthwash. These two steps can help prevent tooth decay and eliminate pockets where bacteria and germs can build up. Sickness Hygiene If you're not feeling well, you should take steps to keep from spreading germs to others. This includes covering your mouth and nose when sneezing, wiping down shared surfaces with an antibacterial wipe, and not sharing any utensils or electronics. Also, immediately throw away any soiled tissues. Hands Hygiene Germs on your hands can easily enter your body through your mouth, nose, eyes, or ears. Wash your hands: When you handle food; Before you eat; If you handle garbage; When you sneeze; Any time you touch an animal. Likewise, wash your hands after changing a baby's diaper, helping someone clean themselves, or when cleaning a cut or wound.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS132Food Hygiene and Sanitation Food hygiene is referred to the conditions and measures which are necessary to ensure the safety of food from production to consumption. Food can get contaminated at any point during slaughtering or harvesting, processing, storage, distribution, transportation and preparation. Lack of adequate food hygiene can cause foodborne diseases and the death of the consumer. Food hygiene constitutes a basic necessity of Good Manufacturing/Agricultural Practices and the development of Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP). The personal cleanliness and hygiene of food preparers are essential to protect against foodborne illness. In addition to regular hand washing, some states require food preparers to wear latex gloves as an additional safeguard. Clean hair and clean clothing are essential. If a food preparer is dirty, the risk for food contamination increases greatly. Food sanitation and hygiene guidelines require food preparers to wear hats, hairnets and beard guards to make sure that hair doesn't contaminate food. Similarly, wearing aprons outside the food preparation area isn't permitted since bacteria are so easily carried back to the kitchen. Food sanitation is an essential aspect of food preparation. Food sanitation implies: Cleanliness Preparing Storing & Serving of food & water Some items that need particular attention are: A safe and potable water supply Selection of wholesome ingredients & Hygienic handling Water is essential in food preparation. Water is used to wash food before cooking. Clean the containers that make a beverage. It should be free from pathogenic bacteria. Water is potable if: It is free from pathogenic bacteria; It is free from harmful bacteria; It contains dissolved salts or minerals .FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 133Environmental Sanitation and Safety It is generally believed that the assurance of food safety is primarily connected with the elimination of contamination in the full cycle of food production, from raw materials through manufacturing to finished products and kitchen operations. Among potential contaminants, primarily pesticides, heavy metals, and some biological contaminants have to be taken under consideration. The majority of these contaminants are of environmental origin. So, it is understandable that a prerequisite of the production of safe food is the hindering of pollution in the environment. In this chapter, some aspects of the interrelations of food safety and environmental sanitation will be treated. Integrated Pest Management and Food Safety The last 40 years of the twentieth century saw a remarkable scientific revolution in agriculture, in which chemical technology played an important role. A broad range of chemicals is now used in agriculture to lessen the losses caused by different pests. Pests-including insects, mites, pathogens (disease-causing microorganisms), weeds, nematodes, rodents, and others-contribute by high farm-producing costs and reduced quality and yields. Farm production losses by pests are estimated to exceed 35% annually. So, it is clear that the reduction of these losses by using different chemicals is important from the point of view to increase the efficiency of agricultural production. The use of chemicals in agricultural production has provided several benefits in terms of increasing production and quality. However, as a result, consumers are exposed indirectly to chemicals, usually in minute quantities. Although the level of residues in food is low, they represent an additional health hazard for people consuming residue containing food. Because some types of these chemicals, such as organo-chlorine pesticides, heavy metals, and triazine herbicides, can not be degraded by naturally occurring soil microorganisms, the soil and water may also be polluted. In addition, it should be mentioned that because of the transformation of pesticides in plants and soil, different metabolites are formed. Some of them may also be toxic. For pesticides, less than 1% of all the wells measured had concentrations slightly above levels that were considered safe for human health, while about 1% of the community wells and about 2.4% of the private rural wells contained nitrate concentrations above the maximum contaminant level established to protect human health. Any harmful health effects of pesticides are usually linked with the amount or dose of the pesticide. For example, a chemical worker who during the manufacture of a pesticide harmful to humans accidentally comes into direct contact with large amounts of the pesticide could face serious injury. Yet, because the danger is so great, strict safety requirements have drastically reduced the likelihood of such an industrial accident occurring.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS134Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is an ecological approach to pest suppression. The establishment of an integrated pest suppression system should be based on a thorough knowledge of: Crop and animal production methods; biology and ecology of each pest species and basic information on the genetics and physiology of pest species; relationships of the pests with the crop and other biological and physiological components of the ecosystem; potential economic damage of each pest and pest complex; the issue of food safety and hygiene is a universal concern. This is because everyone has to consume food. This is a requirement for all people across the nation as well as the globe to be healthy. EXERCISES Q-1 What do you mean by personal hygiene? Q-2 Why is it important for all food handlers to adopt hygienic habits? Q-3 Differentiate between food hygiene, food safety and food sanitation. Q-4 Describe how Integrated Pest Management & Food Safety are interrelated. Q-5 Make a list of any five unhygienic practices that you have observed in a fast food centre.FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 135Introduction For good health, we must eat good food. By good food, we mean nutritionally balanced, wholesome and safe food. Adulteration in food products is a part of undernutrition. Adulteration causes loss of nutrients in food products and sometimes may prove very harmful for the body. Furthermore, the consumer is cheated not only for his money by adulteration but also in quantity and quality as well. In India, adulteration of foodstuff is commonly practiced by the trade. Consumers like to get maximum quantity for a low price. The sellers must meet the needs of the buyers, to be able to exist. This is a vicious cycle. When the price of food production is higher than the price which the consumer is prepared to pay, a seller is bound to supply food products of inferior quality. Thus, adulteration occurs. Food adulteration can be explained as the intentional addition or substitution or abstraction of substance that adversely affects the nature of substance and quality of food products. It can be at the time of harvesting, storage, processing, transportation or distribution Types of Adulteration Adulteration may be intentional or unintentional. The former is a willful act on the part of the adulterator intended to increase the margin of profit. Incidental contamination is usually due to negligence, ignorance or lack of proper facilities. A. Intentional adulterants: Intentional adulterants are sand, marble chips, stones mud, chalk powder, water, mineral oil and coaltar, dyes. These adulterants cause harmful effects on the body.Chapter 15 FOOD ADULTERATION Learning Objectives : After reading this chapter, the students will be able to: 1. Define the terms food adulteration, and list the common adulterants; 2. Demonstrate the common methods for testing adulterants at home; 3. List the various standards as set by FSSAI for food products.UNIT - 04CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS136B. Incidental adulterants: Raw foods such as meat, fish, milk and vegetables grown in sewage are likely to be contaminated with harmful micro-organisms. These are generally destroyed during the cooking or processing of food. Some of the micro- organisms may survive due to insufficient heat processing. Further, some of the foods, if consumed in the raw state, may lead to food poisoning. Recent studies have shown that food grains, legumes and oilseeds when stored in the humid atmosphere are infected by a pathogenic fungus which can cause serious illness. To check the growing tendency of food adulteration, the Government of India had introduced \"Prevention of Food Adulteration Act\" (PFA) in 1954. This Act is based on international standards, keeping in mind the Indian conditions. This Act came into force on June 1, 1955. Fssai (Food Safety and Standard Authority of India) Figure 15.1: FSSAI Symbol In 2006, the Food Safety and Standard Authority of India (FSSAI) was established under the Food Safety and Standard Act, 2006 which consolidates various acts. The Act has laid down science-based standards for articles of food and regulates their manufacture, storage, distribution, and import to ensure availability of safe and wholesome food for human consumption and for matter and incidents connected therewith. The following foodstuffs should be deemed to be adulterated: - 1. If it is not of the nature, substance, and quality which it ought to be; 2. If it contains cheaper or inferior ingredients incidentally or intentionally; 3. If it has been prepared by a process which alters the nature, substance, or quality of foodstuff; 4. If any constituent has been abstracted partially or wholly from it like an abstraction of cream from milk; 5. If it has been prepared, packed, or kept under unsanitary conditions;FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 1376. If it is infected with insects, worms, etc.; 7. If it is obtained from a sick or diseased animal, e.g., milk and meat of diseased animals; 8. If it contains poisonous ingredients which are injurious to health; 9. If the container renders it poisonous or injurious to health; 10. If it contains unpermitted colours or any excessive amount of permitted ones; 11. If it contains prohibited preservatives or an excessive amount of permitted ones; 12. If it does not satisfy the prescribed standards laid down by the authorities even though they do not have an adverse effects on health. Standards Standards framed by FSSAI are prescribed under Food Safety and Standards (Food Product Standards and Food Additives) Regulation, 2011, Food Safety and Standards (Packaging and Labelling) Regulation, 2011 and Food Safety and Standards (Contaminants, Toxins, and Residues) Regulations, 2011. The FSSAI has prescribed standards for the following food products: Dairy products and analogues; Fats, oils and fat emulsions; Fruits and vegetable products; Cereal and cereal products; Meat and meat products; Fish and fish products; Sweets & confectionery; Sweetening agents including honey; Salt, spices, condiments and related products; Beverages, (other than dairy and fruits & vegetables based); Other food products and ingredients; Proprietary food; Irradiation of food.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS138The development of standards is a dynamic process based on the latest developments in food science, food consumption patterns, new food products and additives, changes in the processing technology leading to changed specifications, advancements in food analytical methods, and identification of new risks or other regulatory options. If a food product violates one or more of the above said standards, it will be regarded as adulterated food and the seller will be punished under the law . According to PFA Act, Food Adulteration Includes: - Intentional addition, substitution or abstraction or substances adversely affect the purity and quality of foods. Incidental contamination of foods with deleterious substances such as toxins and insecticides due to ignorance, negligence or lack of proper storage facilities. Contamination of the food with harmful insects, micro-organisms like bacteria, fungus, moulds, etc. during production, storage and handling. An adulteration of food may risk health if the physiological functions of the consumer are affected due to either addition or the removal of a vital component. An adulterant is any material that is employed or which could be employed for the purpose of adulteration is defined as an adulterant.

But today everyone is so busy that they do not have time to cook food at home and rely on readymade items. These have different kinds of preservatives that are used to keep them in good condition for a long period. But these are really harmful and have harmful effects on our health. Today almost all the food items that you will get in the market have some or the other kind of adulterant which brings down the nutritional value and causes different types of health hazards. Let us know more about adulteration and how it is harmful to your health. 1. Metanil Yellow Metanil yellow is a food colour used widely in various foods. It is also used as an adulterant in different spices especially turmeric and regular Indian foods like pulses. Metanil yellow belongs to the \"non-permitted\" category of food colour. Continued consumption of this toxic food colour can cause life-threatening effects on humans. Consumption of metanil yellow in food may affect our nervous system and may lead to brain damage. Metanil yellow consumed through food enters our digestive system directly. Studies reveal that metanil yellow causes gastrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and damages the intestine. 2. Argemone Oil Consumption of adulterated mustard oil (Brassica nigra) with argemone oil (Argemone mexicana) even for a short period leads to a clinical condition referred as epidemic dropsy. In humans, argemone oil contained in adulterated mustard oil causes oxidative stress and death of red blood cells via met-hemoglobin formation by altering pyridine nucleotide(s) and glutathione redox potential. Argemone oil contamination poses a serious threat to human health. 3. Kesari Dal Extreme consumption of Kesari dal produces Lathyrism (a form of crippling, paralysis of both lower limbs) mainly in boys and men between the age group of 5 to 45 years. This disease manifests itself in 2-4 months if the diet consists of 40% or more of Kesari dal. The disease starts with the stiffness of knee joints and legs, with pain around the knee and ankle joints. Within 10-30 days of the onset of symptoms, paralysis of the lower limbs sets in. The patient slowly becomes crippled as his knees are bent and stiff.FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 141Food Items Brand Tasted Rapid Test Result Adulterant Remarks Chilly powderi) Stand ii) Substandard iii) LooseTake 2 gm of the sample, in a test- tube, add a few ml of solvent ether and shake.

FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 143A food label is defined as a panel found on a package of food that contains a variety of information about the nutritional value of the food item. There are many pieces of information that are standard on most food labels, including serving size, the number of calories, grams of fat, included nutrients, and a list of ingredients. This information helps people who are trying to restrict their intake of fat, sodium, sugar, or other ingredients, or those individuals who are trying to get enough of the healthy nutrients such as Calcium or Vitamin C. The food label is referred to any tag, brand, mark, pictorial or other descriptive matter, written, printed, stenciled, marked, embossed or impressed on, or attached to, a container of food. Food labelling includes any printed, written or graphic matter that is present on the label, accompanies the food, or is presented near the food, including that for the purpose of promoting its sale or disposal. The label may either be engraved or attached to the packaging of the product.Chapter 16 READING AND UNDERSTANDING FOOD LABELS Learning Objectives : After reading this chapter, the students will be able to: 1. Explain the term Food Label and its importance. 2. List the advantages and disadvantages of food labels. 3. Elaborate on the labelling provisions in existing food laws.UNIT - 04 Figure 16.1: Nutrition FactsCENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS144A food label must have the following:- Name of the product; Brand name Trademark Manufacturer's name and address Name of the country in which the product is made Ingredients Net weight/ volume/ length Use of the product; Maximum retail price (inclusive of all the taxes) Warning and precautions Directions for use Standard mark Date of manufacture Date of best before Batch/lot number Details of colour or added preservatives Figure 16.2: LabelFOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 145Advantages of a Food Label Labels help a consumer in making a wise decision. The label offers detailed information about a food's nutrient content. One can use the label to compare two similar foods to decide what would be the healthier choice. The list of ingredients is very important in case a person is allergic to some ingredients. They also help to see the quality of the product through the given standardised marks. The rates and the quantities can be checked and compared. In case of any defect, the manufacturer can be contacted directly through the address given. A consumer can refer to the label as and when required. Any special scheme offered by the manufacturer is also mentioned on the label. Labels guide the consumers on how to store and use the products. Limitations of a Food Label Labels may not give complete information. The print may be blurred, small or overlapping. Labels of popular brands may be initiated in case of sub-standard products. How to Read a Food Label Most foods in the grocery stores have a nutrition facts label and a list of ingredients. When you go for grocery shopping, spend some time reading the nutritional facts labels on the foods you purchase. Compare nutrients and calories in one food to those in another. The information may surprise you. Make sure you are not buying the food high in calories, saturated and trans fats, sodium and added sugars. Information of the Nutritional Facts provided by Label Serving Size: This means that how much of the food is considered a \"serving\". A package may contain multiple servings. If you eat more or less than the serving size listed, you need to adjust the number of nutrients and calories that you will be eating.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS146 Calories: This tells you how much energy is in the food. It is helpful to know if you are cutting calories to lose weight or want to manage your weight. Total Fat: This is the amount of fat found in one serving of food. It includes the amount of \"bad fats\" (saturated and trans fats) and \"better fats\" (monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats). Fat is higher in calories than protein or carbohydrates. So, cutting back on your fat intake will help you reduce the member of calories you eat. Saturated Fat: Eating too much of these \"bad fats\" can raise your cholesterol and your risk of heart disease and stroke. Limit your saturated fat intake to less than 5 to 6 percent of your total calories. For a person who needs 2,000 calories a day, this is about 11 to 13 grams of saturated fat. Trans Fat: These fats are also considered \"bad fats\" because they can raise LDL (LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN) cholesterol and risk of heart disease. Choose foods with \"0\" grams of trans fat and read the ingredients list to avoid foods made with \"hydrogenated oils\". Everyone can benefit by restraining from trans fats. Cholesterol: The FDA's Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend eating less than 300 mg of cholesterol per day to maintain normal cholesterol levels. If you are at high risk of heart disease then they recommend consuming less than 200 mg per day. Sodium: You need to look for both naturally occurring and added sodium in food products. Salt is sodium chloride. Most people must consume less than 1,500 mg of sodium per day. That is equal to little more than \u00bd tsp. of salt. Total Carbohydrates: A carbohydrate is a type of sugar. Carbohydrates in food are digested and further converted into glucose, or sugar, to provide energy to the cells of the body. Select carbohydrate-based foods with the high quantity of nutrients. These include vegetables, fruits and whole-grain, bread, cereals and pasta. Dietary Fibre: Dietary fibre describes several materials that make up the parts of plants your body cannot digest. Being part of a healthy diet, soluble fibre can help decrease your risk of heart disease and some types of cancer. Whole grains and fruits and vegetables include dietary fibre. Most refined (processed) grains contain little fibre.FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 147 Sugar: The amount of sugar listed includes both sugar that occurs naturally in foods, such as fruit and milk and sugar that is added to the food items, such as soft drinks and other sweetened foods and beverages. There are several different names for \"added sugars\" such as sucrose, fructose, glucose, maltose, dextrose, high-fructose corn syrup, corn syrup, concentrated fruit juice, and honey. Check the ingredients list and make sure that there aren't a lot of \"added sugars\" listed in the ingredients. Protein: This is one of the important components in food that provides us with energy. Animal protein contains saturated fat. Select fish and skinless poultry and limit your intake of red meat. Use low-fat dairy products. Try other sources of protein such as beans, nuts, seeds, tofu and other soy-based products. Vitamins and Minerals: Vitamins and minerals are essential parts of your diet. Eating a variety of foods will help you reach your daily goal of 100 percent of vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium and iron. Daily Value: The standard daily values are guides for people who eat 2,000 calories each day. If you eat more or less than that, your daily value may be higher or lower. Importance of A Food Label Ensuring food safety is a shared responsibility between governments, producers, industry and consumers. Food labelling is one way through which consumers can get knowledge about the food they consider buying. Correctly following the information provided on the food labels (such as expiry dates, handling instructions and allergy warnings) can help the consumers to prevent unnecessary food-borne illnesses and allergic reactions. Reading food labels carefully it much easier for you to compare foods and find the foods that have the nutritional value for a child needs. It will help to make healthy choices about the foods. Food labels can help you limit the amount of fat, sugar and cholesterol in your diet by making it easy for you to compare one food item with another and choose the one with lower amounts. Conversely, you can use food labels to find food items higher in vitamins, fibre and protein. The nutritional data found on a food label is based on one serving of that particular food item. That is one of the most common mistakes people make when they read the food labels. A food label may indicate that a food has 100 calories and only 5 grams of CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS148sugar, for example. But, if you look at the number of servings, it may state three. That means that if you were to eat the entire packet, you would be getting three times the amount shown on the food label. In this example, 300 calories and 15 grams of sugar are stated . Don't be fooled, always look at what makes one serving (on which the food label information is based) and how many servings in that package are mentioned. Standard/Certification Mark This is a mark given to a product that meets certain standards with respect to the quality of the product in terms of: Materials used; Method of manufacturing; Packing; Sale; Performance. The standard mark specifies that a product has been produced according to the norms laid down by the standardising agency. Standard marks also encourage the manufacturers to provide better competition in the market and also to upgrade the quality of their products. Standard Marks with reference to Food Products A. ISI Mark It is a certification mark given by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). INDIAN STANDARD INSTITUTION (ISI) prescribes standards for product specification, methods of testing, etc. It develops consciousness among manufacturers and encourages them to produce quality products.FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 149 It gives the manufacturers licences to use the ISI mark. This is given only after ensuring that the manufacturer is capable of producing the products as per the requirement on a continuous basis. The quality is maintained right from the raw material, from the process to the finished product. This ensures that the finished product is in conformity to the laid down standards. It also publishes many informative pamphlets and booklets on standards relating to many products. ISI mark is given to: Custard powder, common salt, baking powder, cocoa, milk powder, condensed milk, wafers, coffee, ice cream, chewing gum, drinking chocolate, mineral water, etc. B. AG MARK This was set up by the Directorate of Marketing and Inspection of the Government of India. It establishes norms for agricultural and livestock products at natural and processed stages. It categorises commodities into various grades depending on the degree of purity. These grades are 1,2,3,4 or extra-large, large, medium, small, etc. These standards also specify the type of packing to be used for different products for example special egg trays, milk polybags, oil bags or cartons. AG MARK is given to: Ghee, butter, oil, wheat flour, rice, powdered sugar, spices, eggs, fruits, etc.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS150C. FPO (Fruit Product Order) It lays minimum standards relating to the quality of variously preserved foods made from fruits and vegetables. It lays standard of hygiene and sanitation. It lays minimum standards that must be maintained throughout the farming, manufacturing, processing and retailing of the product. It also gives instructions for packaging, labelling and temperatures of food containers. FPO is given to: Pickles, Jams, Jellies, Ketchup, Frozen and Canned food. Nutrition Labelling The food industry contributes to nutrition education by offering products that correspond to the current needs of the consumer and by informing them about product ingredients and nutritional characteristics. Nutrition labelling refers to the standardised presentation of the nutrient content of the food. Generally, the claims fall into some broad categories:- Nutrition Claims- They can be categorised as representations which state, suggest or imply that a food has particular nutritional properties including energy value, the content of protein, fat, carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals. The list of ingredients and mandatory declaration cannot be treated as a nutrition claim. Nutrient Content Claim - This is a nutrition claim that describes the level of a nutrient contained in food for example- low in fat, rich in iron or low sodium. Comparative Claim - It is a claim that compares nutrient levels or energy value of two or more foods. The foods being compared should be different versions of the same food or similar food. The difference in nutrient content and energy value should be given.FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 151 Nutrient Function Claim - This is a claim that describes the physiological role of a nutrient in the growth, development and normal function of the body e.g. contains calcium for stronger teeth. Guiding Principles of Nutrition Labelling To make nutrition labelling useful, available and accessible to consumers. At the same time, they should be clear, simple, accurate, practical, readable, informative, consistent and legible; The serving size should be realistic. Labelling provisions in existing Food Laws, the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 Under this Act every package of food shall carry a label giving the following information: The name, trade name or description of food contained in the package; the name of ingredients used in the product in descending order of their composition by weight or by volume as the case maybe; in case, both colour and flavours are used in the product, the label should mention it; if gelatin is used as an ingredient, a declaration should be made using the words \"gelatin animal origin\"; a label should not contain any statement, claim, design, device, fancy name or abbreviation which is false or misleading in any particular way; the Act also makes it mandatory that labels should not use words implying recommendations by the medical profession; the package, label or advertisements of edible oils and fats should not use expressions like Compulsory Best Before Date The government has made it mandatory with effect from July 1999 that all packed food items should necessarily display the best before date. It has been made mandatory that every container of milk substitute or infant food shall indicate in a clear conspicuous and easily readable manner an important notice which reads, 'MOTHER'S MILK IS BEST FOR BABIES' in capitals.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS152Labelling Genetically Modified Foods The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) is in the process of framing regulations for Genetically-modified (GM) foods. According to FSSAI these regulations will focus on procedures for safety assessment and approval of foods, including imported foods derived from genetic-modification processes based on internationally will-established and accepted scientific principles, procedures and best practices before they are allowed for food purposes. Marketing the 'Animal Origin' Food From October 2001, it has become mandatory for all foods containing ingredients of animal origin to sport a brown dot encased in a brown box. As of now, milk and milk products if they are used as an ingredient are exempted from this order . EXERCISES Q-1 Expand the term: HFSS and FSSAI. Q-2 What do you understand by food standardization marks? Give any two examples. Q-3 Write any three advantages and disadvantages of food labels. Q-4 Create a food label for any beverage of your choice based on the mandatory requirements of a label. Q-5 Write any six nutrition facts provided by a label. Q-6 Draw and label the standardization marks of: ISI, FPO, AGMARK.FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 153As per \"Dietary Guidelines for Indians, 2011\" by the National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), a balanced diet is one that provides all nutrients in required amounts and proper proportions. It should provide around 50-60% of total calories from carbohydrates, preferably from complex carbohydrates, about 10-15% from proteins and 20-30% from both visible and invisible fat. In addition, it should provide other non-nutrient such as dietary fibre, antioxidants, which bestow positive health benefits. The guidelines portray the importance of foods through a \"Food Pyramid\" (Figure 17.1). A balanced diet is recommended through a blend of four basic food groups like cereals, millets and pulses; vegetables and fruits; oils, fats and nuts; milk and animal foods. Notably, food items such as burgers, pizzas, fries, chocolates, ice creams, jams etc. are not considered the right choice to meet nutrient needs and must be eaten sparingly.Chapter 17 HFSS FOODS AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS Learning Objectives : After reading this chapter, the students will be able to: 1. Understand the concerns associated with the consumption of HFSS foods. 2. Highlight the risk factors of HFSS foods in children's. 3. List the steps to enhance availability of wholesome and nutritious food among children.UNIT - 04 Figure 17.1: Food PyramidCENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS154HFSS Foods' and Ingredients of Concern As per the WHO Document titled \"Marketing of Foods High in Fat, Salt and Sugar to Children-Update 2012-2013, foods that are high in fat, salt and sugar are commonly termed as HFSS Foods. Sugar: Sugar is empty calories with no helpful effect and there is no safe level of its intake. High use of sugar, mainly fructose, is harmful. Studies have established a direct relationship of sugar with obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Salt: Salt is added for the preservation and enhancing the taste of the food. The high salt content in diets is highly associated with high blood pressure and related cardiovascular diseases. Evidence suggests that high salt intake increases the mass of the left ventricle, stiffens and narrows the arteries, including coronary and renal arteries. It increases the probability of stroke, the severity of cardiac failure and tendency for platelets to aggregate. As per WHO, cutting down on dietary salt intake to recommended 5 g per day has a major impact on reducing blood pressure and cardiovascular diseases. Saturated Fatty Acid (SFA): SFAs are broadly used in packaged foods including cookies, crackers, and snack chips. When consumed in excess of the recommended limit (less than 10% of total calorie intake), SFAs are known to clog arteries and the increase risk of heart attack and stroke. Trans Fatty Acid (TFA): TFAs are formed during the process of hydrogenation of vegetable oils (PHVOs) to make it semi solid that enables longer shelf life, better form and texture. Typically, they are found to be high in bakery products and snacks that are deep-fried in PHVOs. TFAs are well known to have an adverse impact on blood lipid levels as they reduce the amount of good cholesterol (HDL) and increase bad cholesterol (LDL). Their consumption increases insulin resistance and promotes obesity. WHO recommends less than 1% of calories from TFAs. Besides the above key ingredients of concern, caffeine used in carbonated beverages and energy drinks is an addictive stimulant, which, if consumed in excess, can lead to impaired muscle and nerve functions, dehydration and a host of other disorders. Consumption of caffeine, particularly among school children, is a matter of concern and needs to be strictly regulated in compliance with the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 and Regulations made there under. An unhealthy diet leads to metabolic changes and conditions such as overweight, high blood pressure, raised blood glucose and cholesterol, which are among the leading causes of NCD deaths in India.FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 155Childhood obesity Childhood obesity is one of the most serious public health challenges of the 21st century. Overweight children are likely to become obese adults. As per WHO, about 44% of the diabetes burden and 23% of the CVD burden is attributable to overweight and obesity. Overweight children are more likely than non-overweight children to develop insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases at a younger age, which in turn are associated with a higher chance of premature death and disability. Studies have established the link between the consumption of HFSS food and obesity. Numerous studies were done among school children of Delhi, Amritsar, and Southern India show that the prevalence of overweight/obesity is high and on the rise. In urban post-pubertal children of Delhi, it increased from 16% in 2002 to about 24% in 2006. It is high among the affluent class and children of private schools compared to low and middle-income groups. Hypertension In India, hypertension is the leading NCD risk and is estimated to be attributable to over 10 percent of all deaths. Hypertension is strongly associated with high Body Mass Index (BMI) and salt intake. As per WHO, the amount of dietary salt consumed is an important determinant of blood pressure levels and overall cardiovascular risk. World Heart Federation says that a universal reduction in dietary intake of about 3 gm. of salt, would lead to a 50% reduction in the number of people needing treatment for hypertension. The same decrease would lead to a 22% drop in the number of deaths resulting from strokes and a 16% fall in the number of deaths from coronary heart disease. Diabetes and Pediatric Metabolic Syndrome Type 2 diabetes which is very common in adults is now increasingly being reported in children. The leading risk factor for kids is being overweight, often connected with an unhealthy diet and lack of physical activity. Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of the risk factors for type-2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease characterized by abdominal obesity and others such as high blood pressure and increased plasma glucose. Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) CHD affects Indians with greater frequency and at a younger age than counterparts. CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS156HFSS Food Consumption in India Consumption o f 'HFSS Food' is steeply increasing both in urban and rural areas. The ease of availability, taste, low cost, aggressive marketing and advertisements and peer pressure make them popular with children. HFSS Food Replacing Balanced Diet is a Key Issue: As per NIN dietary guidelines \"The shift from traditional to 'modern' foods, changing cooking practices, increased intake, intensive promotion of HFSS foods and beverages have affected people's perception of foods as well as their dietary behavior. An irrational preferences for energy-dense foods and those with high sugar and salt content pose a serious health risk to the people, especially children. The increasing number of overweight and obese people in the community and the resulting burden of chronic non-communicable diseases necessitates systematic nutrition education interventions on a massive scale.\" Additionally, a Lot is at Stake if Balanced Diet is Replaced: A diverse range of macronutrients and micronutrients in its most natural form; Original flavors, colors and aroma that continue to keep the appetite alive for a lifetime; A wide range of time tested spices and herbs that continue to act at a prophylactic level (preventive) at sub- therapeutic levels. Preventive Measures Several countries have taken steps to enhance the availability of wholesome and nutritious food to school children and to restrict/limit the availability of HFSS foods among them. With respect to India, the proposed guidelines are based on the following principles: Children are not the Best Judge of Their Food Choice Children have a limited understanding of the impact of food on their health. Broadly, they are not aware of the concept of a balanced diet and what kind of food is to be consumed and avoided to achieve it. They also lack the required know-how on diseases and their relation to diet. While on one hand, they lack awareness and necessary discretion, such products are being promoted by manufacturers. They are one of the biggest viewer groups of television and food advertisements that constitute a major share of overall TV , radio and print advertisements across the world. Schools are not the Right Place for Promoting HFSS Foods Schools are a place to learn the right values and constructive behaviors for a lifetime. Since food consumption at school is a significant part of the overall daily FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 157diet, schools should not allow canteens to promote food habits that negatively impact the health of children. Benefits of Balanced, Fresh and Traditional Food Cannot be Replaced Frequent consumption of foods high in salt, sugar and fats and low in other essential macro and micronutrients is detrimental and should best be avoided. Such eating behaviors may extend beyond schools and become dietary habits. It is necessary to improve the dietary habits of school children by providing and an appropriate mixing of foods that enhances the wholesomeness and nutrition and also encourages them to avoid consumption of unhealthy diet. Physical activity is another important element of promoting growth and helps in reducing the risks and incidence of non-communicable diseases.
