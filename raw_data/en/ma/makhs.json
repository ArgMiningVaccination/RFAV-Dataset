Casas, MD hen Astrid Deleon was just two-and-a-half months oldshe was hospitalized with renalfailure caused by a defect in herliver. Her diagnoses wasoxalosis, a hereditary diseasethat causes the body to depositoxalate into the kidneys andcauses them to fail. Astridneeded a kidney and livertransplant right away. Despitethe presence of oxalosis,Astrid's liver was otherwisefunctioning normally. Atransplant would preventfurther damage to her kidneys. At the same time, another child in the ICU was dying ofacute liver failure. The Deleonfamily was asked if the trans-plant staff could recoverAstrid's liver after she receivedher kidney/liver transplant. Thekidney would be used as atemporary transplant for thedying child, since no other organ was immediatelyavailable. They did nothesitate to say yes. Unfortun-ately, the child who receivedAstrid's recovered organ didnot survive. But the Deleonfamily's gift should not gounnoticed. Astrid received a kidney/ liver transplant and did verywell. She was the youngestkidney/liver transplantrecipient ever. After Astrid'stransplant, her brother Ivanwas rushed to the emergencyroom. He was unable to voidand had severe back pain. Ivanwas also diagnosed withoxalosis as well as kidneystones. livermaintained normal functiondespite having oxalosis. Once Astrid recovered and went home, the Deleon'sdoctors began to discuss atransplant for Ivan, who neededonly a liver. His mother wastested and was found to be amatch. Just as Ivan was scheduled for his transplant, abeautiful three-and-a-half-week-old baby was diagnosedwith a coagulation defect thatclotted the vessels to his liverand left him in acute liverfailure. By chance, the baby,Matthew, has the same bloodtype as Ivan.

This can be very difficultat any time, but especially after thesummer months. Most Americans lead hectic, busy lives. We rarely take time for ourselves. Add being a transplant recipient to the mix,where you must adhere to medications, appointmentsand eating right (among other things) and suddenly thetask of living seems impossible. We all need to sit backfor a moment and think about how we spend our time(see time management strategies and ideas in \"Don'tDo Lunch,\" on page 3). If you haven 't set some time aside, even 30 minutes, then you need to take a good hard look at how you canwork yourself into your schedule. You are important,so take the time for YOU!!

Thetruth of the matter is that most people don 't believe they have the time. You have to make the time to exercise. Lack of time is the number one barrier to exer- cise. In a sense, this is true because we cannot addmore hours to the day. The key here is how wechoose to spend those hours. We must choose howwe best manage our time. Whether you realize it ornot, you are making choices every day. You simplyhave to decide what is most important to you. YOUmust control your time or IT will control you. Think about the number of minutes you spend talking on thephone, watching television, orentertaining guests. In my home,it is an unspoken rule that whenI am working out, I am not to bedisturbed. You must take thiscontrol, too. Otherwise, theimportant things in your life willnot get the attention they deserve.Simply by not answering thephone you could save enoughtime to get a half an hour ofexercise each day. Unless it is anemergency, the calls can wait. We have becomeslaves to technology. Instead of saying I can 't find time, say I will make the time. Once you have decidedthat this iswhat you aregoing so to choiceswill have an effect on your long-term behavior. Begin by searching and recovering some hiddenmoments within your day. Ifyou have to go to the grocerystore for a couple of items andyou live close enough, take awalk. Maybe you have a doctor 's appointment in the morningand you need to drop off thedog somewhere later in the day.If both places are in the samedirection, you can try to sched-ule them closer together to freeup some time at the end of the day. If you can find those little pockets of time you may be able to go for a 20-minute walk or get in some weight training. Injust 20 minutes you can exercise three bodyparts and get some cardiovascular in there, too.Begin slowly and do not overwhelm yourself.

For you men out there, unless you wear makeup and blow dry your hair, you have an extra 15 minutes to work out.It certainly can be done. It 's amazing how a half hour can make an incredible difference in yourenergy level, production, self esteem, confidence,mind, body and soul. Your sense of accomplish-ment will help to keep you motivated. If your workouts are complicated and take too much preparation, then you will probably notkeep up with them. Simplify your workouts. It 's easier to make an excuse than to follow through.Ask yourself if you have time to drive to the gym. If not, try a 20-minute walk. Perhaps working out at home would be more convenient for you. Maybe yourworkout is repetitive. Be sure you are performing the correct exercises. You want to be sure you are working on all your muscle groups. This can become a problem if you are unsure as to what you are doing. You also can shorten your workouts and do them more often. If you do not have an hour to spend that 's fine. Just try to be active every day. There are so many ways you can incorporate exercise into your daily routine, if you set yourmind to it. You need to prepare, plan and beorganized.

However, the liver was well enough toallow Matthew to survive and grow until he couldreceive another transplant. Ivan underwent his transplant, receiving a piece of his mother 's liver. A piece of Ivan 's original liver was then transplanted intoMatthew. Both boys did well and returned homeafter several weeks. Three months later theoxalosis began taking a toll on Matthew 's kidneys, but Matthew had grown enough for hismother to donate a piece of her liver to him. Hissecond transplant was performed. Today, all three recipients, Astrid, Ivan and Matthew, are doing well. This is a remarkablestory about a remarkable family. Despite thedifficulties of having two of their children afflictedwith a disease that required them to undergo life-threatening procedures, Juan Deleon and hiswife Sonia were able to think about the lives ofothers and give unselfishly of themselves. It isalso remarkable that living donation for livertransplant is now a such a successful option. Adela T.

Transplant Chronicles, Vol. 8, No. 2 5Some people know about the miracle ofdonation and still do notagree to donate whenasked. So it is not simplya task of public educationand awareness that mustbe undertaken. Toincrease organ donation,donation must become a social responsibility and a hopeful act. Development of social responsibility is ingrained in community networks, organiza-tions and activities. All of us have our ownpersonal \"world \" comprised of communities from smaller to larger: Family, extended family,friends, neighbors, suburb, city, county, state,nation and finally, the world, the ubiquitous\"community of man. \" The smaller the community, the more we relate to it, the more real it becomes and themore likely it is that people will feel a sense ofsocial responsibility and desire to experience thathopeful act - agreeing to donate organs and tissues. Churches, philanthropies and newsagencies know this because they don 't talk about the needs of the country in general, but rather,make it real by talking about local families, localneeds, local news and so on. What can recipientsdo to help? Do something local! Get involved withyour local organ procurement organization(OPO), transplant center, hospital, church orservice organization to make a difference. Wasn 't it Tip O 'Neil who said, \"All politics is local? \" Making organ donation real to people is done through the tedious, grass roots work ofcommunity advocacy for organ donation andtransplantation. This is usually long-term workwithout immediate benefits, but it can beundertaken in such a way that the communitycan see the benefits of its work. What this meansis that a good number of dedicated people mustremain active in their community to build acollective community organ donation experience.After years of investment, this approach will yieldmericans hate to stand in line. And waiting in line is harder to endure when there is more atstake - getting into a movie late, missing an important meeting or wasting time when abeautiful spring day beckons. When one 's ability to affect the movement of the line or one 's place in the line diminishes, the wait is even moreacutely felt. Waiting for an organ transplant is perhaps the worst kind of waiting because you 're not feeling well and the line doesn 't move fast enough. More than 70,000 people are on a waiting list in thiscountry, while there are approximately 5,800organ donors each year. These are facts quicklylearned by those standing in this particular line.Knowing this makes the unavoidable fact thatmany of them will drop out of that line, throughdeath, before receiving a life-saving organtransplant all the more real. In fact, 16 peopledie every day waiting for a transplant. The people in line hope for a good act, a decent deed - a gift of life in order to get off the waiting list and get on with life. Families of brain-dead patients can make the unselfish decision of donating their loved one 's organs. Yet, only about 50 percent of familiesagree to donate. Why only half? It is difficult tounderstand the hesitance to donate because weknow that donation saves lives and we know thatmost major religions support donation. We alsoknow that there is no associated financialburden and that organs are scarce. We naivelyassume that the word is not out yet and that thepublic is not aware of the great need for and thebenefits of organ and tissue donation. But thetruth is less promising than that assumption. The \"Line\" on Successful Community Donation Programs: The Case for Grassroots Organ and Tissue Donation Advocacy By Teresa Shafer, RN, MSN, CPTC A Continued on page 17rgan and cornea donation worldwide showed virtually no increase in 1999, according topreliminary statistics released by the UnitedNetwork for Organ Sharing (UNOS) and the Eye Bank Association of American (EBAA) in the U.S., and the Eurotransplant InternationalFoundation, based in Leiden, the Netherlands.Except in isolated cases, the number of organsand corneas procured and transplanted were thesame or lower than 1998, the organizationsreport. Despite an increase in both living organ donation and transplant procedures performed inthe US, the number of people in the US who diedwaiting for a transplant in 1999 actually increasedby 19 percent. UNOS reported that 6,012 patientsdied waiting in 1999, compared to 5,034 in 1998. The EBAA reported that the number of cornea grafts transplanted increased by 186 (1 percent)in 1999, compared to 1998, while the number oftotal donors actually decreased by 4 percent. The1 percent increase in corneal grafts performed isthe lowest in 10 years, the association said. The Eurotransplant International Foundation, which coordinates the international exchange ofdonor organs in six countries \u2014Austria, Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands andSlovenia \u2014reported that the total number of organ transplants performed in the population area wasabout the same in 1999 as in 1998. There were 5,183 organ transplants performed in 1999, compared to 5,161 in 1998, Eurotrans-plant reported. The number of organs donated in1999 was 5,060 compared to 5,042 in 1998. The disparities between the six European countries have been increasing steadily, accordingto Eurotransplant. For example, in Austria,Belgium and Luxembourg there were 87 and 70transplants per million population respectivelyperformed in 1999, compared to Germany and the Netherlands which reported 41 and 31 transplants per million population. The main reason for the disparity is the number of available cadaveric donors in therespective countries. In 1999, there were 25 and23 cadaveric donors per million population inAustria and Germany/Luxembourg respectively,compared to Germany and the Netherlands,which had 12 and 10 respectively. In the US there were 5,843 cadaveric donors in 1999, compared to 5,802 in 1998, according toUNOS preliminary data released in late April. Thenumber of transplants performed was 21,941 in1999, compared to 21,255 in 1998. The 3 percentincrease is the first since 1995. The number oftransplants increased for all organs except hearts.The number of heart transplants actuallydecreased to 2,185 compared to 2,345 in 1998.UNOS stressed it expects all the reportednumbers to increase slightly once final figures aretabulated. UNOS reported that the only good news in donation was the increase reported in livingdonation. There were a total of 4,662 livingdonors in 1999, compared to 4,391 in 1998, a 7percent increase. Living liver donation showed themost dramatic rise increasing more than 200percent from 56 donors in 1998 to 173 in 1999. \"There were two main reasons why we were able to perform more transplants last year, \" said William Payne, MD, UNOS president. \"The increase in living donors played a large role, butwe also made better use of the limited supply wedid have. \" Not surprisingly, the number of patients on the waiting list for a kidney experienced the largestnumber of deaths in 1999 - 2,969. They were followed by liver patients - 1,733, heart patients - 706, and lung patients - 578, kidney-pancreas - 167, heart-lung - 53, intestine - 42, pancreas - 17 and pancreas islet - 5.Transplant News Digest Organ, Corneal Donation Showed Virtually No Increase Worldwide In 1999 Despite Public Education Efforts by Jim Warren, editor and publisherFrom the editors of Transplant News O 6Transplant Chronicles, Vol. 8, No. 2Transplant Chronicles, Vol. 8, No. 2 7The EBAA data, which is based on 83 US and 10 international eye banks reporting, showed thatthere were 95,366 corneal donations from 48,122donors in 1999, compared to 95,103 donationsfrom 47,889 donors in 1998. The number ofcorneal donors has remained essentially staticsince 1995. The EBAA reported there were 95,646donations from 48,332 donors in 1995. The 83 US eye banks reported there were 86,877 donations in 1999 from 43,802 donors,compared to 90,621 donations from 45,629donors in 1998.

ASTS CREATING NATIONAL REGISTRY OF ALL LIVING DONOR LIVER TRANSPLANT PROCEDURES TO HELPASSESS RISK The American Society of Transplant Surgeons (ASTS) announced on May 15 that it is creating aNational Registry to gather data that will allowpotential donors and physicians to accuratelyassess the risks of donation and to keep track ofthe number of living donor liver transplants. \"The continued shortage of cadaver livers \u2014 combined with a liver transplant list that has nowclimbed to more than 15,000 \u2014is leading a growing number of patients to consider livingdonor liver transplants, \" said Nancy Ascher, MD, the new ASTS president, announcing the creationof the registry. \"While the early experience with adult-to-adult living donor transplantation atcenters performing this complex procedure isencouraging, donor deaths have occurred, \" Ascher pointed out. \"Because of the lack of data, accurate risk assessment for the donor iscurrently not possible. \" Ascher is chairperson of the department of Surgery at the University ofCalifornia at San Francisco. The announcement was made at Transplant 2000, the first ever joint meeting of the ASTS andthe American Society of Transplantation (AST),held May 13-17 in Chicago, IL. More than 3,600transplant surgeons and physicians from aroundthe world, attended the meeting, an increase ofabout 25 percent over last year. Along with the announcement of the establishment of the registry, the ASTS released aseries of guidelines for living liver donation in aposition paper on adult-to-adult living liver donation. The position paper was developed overthe past year by the ASTS Ethics Committeechaired by Mark Adams, MD, transplant surgeonat Froedtert Memorial Lutheran Hospital inMilwaukee, WI. The position paper lays out the rationale for performing living donor liver transplants and setsout specific guidelines for \"donor and recipient selection, center criteria, and the best approach toobtaining informed consent. \" To receive a copy of the ASTS Position Paper on Adult-to-Adult Living Donor LiverTransplantation, contact the FIRST INTERNAL TRANSPLANT OF A MINIATURE LVAD PERFORMED AT TEXAS HEARTINSTITUTE The world 's first human recipient of a Jarvik 2000 miniaturized left ventricular assist device(LVAD) \"looks great \" and \"is doing fine, \" according to surgeon O.H. Frazier, MD, chief of cardio-pulmonary transplantation at the Texas HeartInstitute at St. Luke 's Episcopal Hospital in Houston. On April 13, Frazier implanted the battery- powered pump, about the size of a wine cork,directly into the left ventricle of a woman withcongestive heart failure (CHF). Frazier wasassisted in the operation by Robert Jarvik, MD,the pump 's New York-based inventor, and Stephen Westaby, MD, a prominent Britishsurgeon. Although the landmark procedure was performed as a stopgap until a donor heart canbe found, it brings the 40,000 Americans withend stage CHF a giant step closer to a permanentalternative to heart transplantation. Moreover, bygiving the damaged heart a chance to rest, thedevice may even allow recovery of natural cardiacfunction. Unlike previous pumps, which were large, bulky and had external components, the Jarvik2000 is small enough to fit in a child. It is entirelyinternal except for a thin wire and small dial thatallows blood flow to be turned up duringstrenuous activity. In some patients, as theweakened heart regains strength, the dial can be turned down until the heart is completely weanedoff the assist device. Because of its tiny size, the Jarvik 2000 is easier to implant and remove than itspredecessors and results in significantly lessblood loss during insertion. Patients generally lose20-30 units of blood during implantations oflarger LVADs, Frazier said, whereas \"this patient (who received the Jarvik 2000) lost one-fifth ofone unit. \" The FDA gave the Texas Heart Institute permission to implant the device in a limitednumber of patients. Houston is the only US site ofthe pilot study, but the pump will also be testedin England. Ten years in the making, the Jarvik 2000 is the latest in a four-decade quest to find a permanentalternative to heart transplantation. Fraziercredits legendary heart surgeon Michael DeBakeyof the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston withinitiating all research into circulatory supportsystems. \"Without Dr. DeBakey 's role in 1963 when he got [federal] funding for the artificialheart program, none of this would have beenpossible, \" said Frazier, a former DeBakey trainee. In 1966, DeBakey implanted the first successful LVAD, which he helped develop, in theheart of a 37-year-old woman from Mexico whoseheart would not restart after surgery. The LVADkept her alive for 10 days, until her own heartrecovered its pumping ability. Some 20 yearslater, DeBakey, now 91, invented a smallcontinuous flow pump that fits beneath the heart.It has been implanted as a bridge to transplant in28 people in Europe and the surgeon expects toreceive FDA approval this year to study the devicein the US. Barney Clark, in 1982, was the first person to receive a Jarvik-7 LVAD. He lived for 112 daystethered to a large console of electronics. In 1986,Jarvik and Frazier began developing aminiaturized continuous flow pump. By 1997,four heart-assist devices \u2014far smaller and more efficient than the Jarvik-7 but not as tiny as theJarvik 2000 \u2014were in common use. And in 1998, DeBakey 's miniature LVAD was implanted in a 56-year-old Berlin man.The Texas Heart Institute plans to test a total replacement heart, which it has developed inconjunction with Danvers, Massachusetts-basedAbiomed Inc., by year 's end. INJECTIONS OF LAB-GROWN LIVER CELLS MAY KEEP END STAGE LIVER DISEASE PATIENTS ALIVE Injections of laboratory-grown liver cells may keep patients with end stage liver disease alivewhile they wait for a liver transplant and may alsohelp treat inherited liver diseases, according to areport presented last month at the ExperimentalBiology 2000 meeting in San Diego, California. Stephen Strom, MD, of the University of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania reported on studies inwhich his team injected liver cells into the spleensof patients with terminal liver failure to serve as abridge to transplantation. Six patients died, butseven survived an average of four days after livercell injection before receiving their transplants. \"They probably were rescued by the whole liver transplant rather than the cells, \" Strom acknowledged. One patient recovered afterreceiving the liver cells alone and never received atransplant. Strom 's group also used the liver cells to correct liver function in an 11-year-old child withCrigler-Najjar syndrome, an inherited liver diseasein which a missing enzyme affects the liver 's ability to process bilirubin, leading to jaundice.The idea behind the liver cell injections was to\"seed\" this liver with normal cells containing the missing enzyme to try to avoid transplantation.Injection of 7.5 billion liver cells into theyoungster 's liver caused activity of the defective enzyme \u2014bilirubin UDP-glucoronosyltransferase \u2014 to rise from 0.5 percent to 5.5 percent within onemonth. Noting that a 10 percent level of theenzyme is probably ideal, \"this appears to be what might be close to a 50 percent clinical cure, \" Strom said. Twenty-two months after the liver cell injections, the patient 's bilirubin level fell by more than 65 percent and the need for phototherapy totreat jaundice decreased by about 50 percent.Another injection of liver cells is planned in anattempt to achieve a complete cure. 8Transplant Chronicles, Vol. 8, No. 2Transplant Chronicles, Vol. 8, No. 2 9GENETIC TESTING CAN HELP IDENTIFY KIDNEY TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS WITH VIRUS THAT CAUSESALLOGRAFT FAILURE Genetic testing can help identify which kidney transplant recipients carry a virus that is a majorcause of allograft failure, according to a study inthe May 4 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine . More than 80 percent of the population is infected with the BK virus. For most people withhealthy immune systems, the infection causes nosymptoms, but in kidney transplant recipients,BK can cause renal failure. To study the impactof the BK virus on kidney transplantation, VolkerNickeleit, MD, and colleagues at the University ofBasel in Switzerland used a polymerase chainreaction (PCR) to detect the virus 's DNA in the blood of nine kidney transplant patients who hadviral disease affecting their transplant and 41who had no signs of such disease. PCR testingidentified BK virus in all nine transplantrecipients with kidney disease. Of the 41recipients without kidney disease, the virus wasdetected in just two people. Acknowledging that the technique requires further study, the authors concluded that PCRtesting is an effective way to identify whichkidney transplant recipients are at risk ofdeveloping renal disease due to the BK virus.Currently, the researchers use the test as ascreen in their practice. If a transplant recipienthas cells in the urine suggesting an active BKviral infection, PCR testing is performed. If thattest is positive, the investigators look for thevirus in a kidney biopsy. Currently, there is no cure for the BK virus. But identifying the infection early and loweringthe dose of immunosuppressants may help theimmune system keep the virus under control,thereby preventing allograft failure, said co-author Hans Hirsch, MD. TRANSPLANTING INSULIN CELLS IN DIABETICS In a third report, Canadian researchers have successfully freed eight diabetics from insulindependence by using a novel, steroid-freeimmunosuppressive regimen in transplantinginsulin-secreting islet cells. All of the subjects, ranging in age from 29 to 53, have remained insulin-free for four to 15months with a median of 11 months. This is aremarkable rate because data from theInternational Islet Transplant Registry found thatonly 12.4 percent of 267 islet cell transplantrecipients were insulin independent beyond oneweek and just 8.2 percent beyond one year. James Shapiro, MD and colleagues of the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canadadeveloped the experimental protocol, whichinvolves injecting islet cells into the liver via theportal vein and preventing rejection using athree-drug regimen of daclizumab plus low-dosetacrolimus and sirolimus. Prior to transplantation, Shapiro said all eight patients had experienced severe hypoglycemicblackouts and metabolic instability. Currently,''none\u2014has residual diabetes by American Diabetes Association criteria '' nor has anyone experienced episodes of acute rejection, diabetes-related symptoms, elevations in lipid levels, orother complications. Most patients required cells from more than one donor organ and required two injections ofcells to become insulin independent. And allmust continue the immunosuppressive regimenindefinitely, if not life-long. The Juvenile Diabetes Foundation praised the team 's accomplishment, heralding the ''Edmonton Protocol, '' as it has been dubbed, as ''a very significant step forward in curing type 1 diabetes. '' ''This is perhaps the most important finding in Type 1 diabetes research in the past decade, '' said Dr. Richard Furlanetto, medical director ofthe Juvenile Diabetes Foundation. ''It represents a real proof of concept. '' Yet as diabetics worldwide clogged phone lines trying to enter clinical trials, Shapiro cautionedthat at this point the therapy is appropriate onlyin adults who have truly failed at injected insulintreatment. He added that the safety of the technique in children will not be known until longer-termresults are available. TCA.Competition's tough!

The majorityof these people are waiting for kidney trans-plants. However, the demand for kidneys alwaysseems to be higher than the supply. Hundreds ofpeople die each year waiting for a kidney.Thankfully, every year many brothers and sisters,mothers and fathers and husbands and wivesgive of themselves in the most unselfish way anddonate one of their kidneys for their loved one. For many years, the donor underwent quite a difficult operation. In fact, the operation for thedonor was much worse than theoperation for the patient receiving thetransplant. The donor 's scar was larger and the operation took longer toperform. The pain donors experiencedafter surgery was worse and therecovery time was long. Despite all ofthis, family members gladlyunderwent the procedure for thebenefit of their loved one. However, afew years ago, thanks to the Nintendogeneration and some surgeons with guts, the\"minimally invasive \" transplant procedure was developed. There are two ways to perform this procedure. It was first developed as what is called a\"laparoscopic kidney surgery. \" This means that the entire procedure is done using a camera.Instead of making one big scar and cutting a lotof muscle, multiple small scars are made and acamera is inserted into the abdomen. Using atelevision screen and special instruments, thesurgeon makes another larger incision (but muchsmaller than the one made with the old operation)to take the kidney out. Why do it this way? At first, many surgeons questioned this procedure, too. The only reasonthat the donor was having the surgery was todonate a kidney. If the kidney was injured duringthe operation and could not be used it wouldcreate a terrible ethical complication. However,after performing the surgery several times, they found that they could remove the kidneyswithout causing harm. The kidneys worked wellonce they were transplanted. The greatest benefitof this method was to the donor. The pain aftersurgery was much less. The scars were smaller.The time in the hospital was shorter. Therecovery time was less and the return to workwas faster. There were problems with the new procedure. The surgery was technically challenging andtime-consuming. Many surgeons did not feel comfortable doing the operation.Because of this, they would not offerit to patients, so only a few patientswere benefitting from the procedure. A few years ago, the \"hand- assisted \" procedure was developed. This added a dimension missingfrom the laparoscopic procedure.The surgeon actually makes a smallscar on the abdomen to put a hand inside the abdomen. This allows the surgeon tofeel the kidney and the important structuresaround it. It also allows the surgeon to move thekidney and add that \"third \" dimension that is lost when you are working on a television screen. Theprocedure takes less time and is considered saferfor the patient and the kidney. The advantages ofthe laparoscopic procedure are maintained and itappears that the kidney works faster aftertransplant. The hand-assisted procedure gives the surgeon more control of the surgery while still offering thedonor a good operation. We have come a long wayin the past few years when it comes to kidneyrecovery for transplantation. We can now offerfamily members a less complicated operation thatwill recover a good functioning kidney for theirloved one while decreasing post-operative painand recovery time for the donor \u2014the best of both worlds. TCMinimally Invasive Surgery for Kidney Donation Is it Better? by Adela T. Casas, MD H Transplant Chronicles, Vol. 8, No. 2 13medical beat Why Do I Need to Follow My Cholesterol and Triglyceride Levels? What Can I Do About Them If They Are High? by Ira D. Davis, M.D. s many as eight out of 10 transplant recipients have elevated blood levels of cholesterolor triglycerides, referred to as hyperlipidemia.This problem is of great concern sincehyperlipidemia (high lipid levels) is a major riskfactor for developing hardening of the arteries inthe heart and vessels of the legs. This articlediscusses the causes of hyperlipidemia intransplant recipients and provides a strategy forreducing the risk of complications. Many factors contribute to elevated blood lipid levels in transplant recipients. They include sideeffects from transplant medications such asprednisone and cyclosporine, poor kidneyfunction, a family history of elevated blood lipidlevels, obesity and high pre-transplant lipid levels.Hyperlipidemia is more common in people whotake cyclosporine (e.g., Neoral or Sandimmune)than in people who take tacrolimus (e.g., Prograf).Rapamycin-based regimens using sirolimus (e.g.,Rapamune), recently approved by the FDA, arealso associated with elevated blood lipid levels.Risk factors for increased blood lipid levels inchildren include prednisone therapy, cyclosporinetherapy, preexisting elevated blood lipid levelsprior to transplantation and reduced kidneyfunction. Management of severe hyperlipidemia, which is characterized by serum cholesterol levels of above275 milligrams/deciliter, \"low density \" cholesterol (LDL cholesterol) above 190 (mg/DL) or triglyceride levels above 400 (mg/DL), requires a number oflifestyle changes and drug therapy. People who have heart diseaseor are at risk for heart disease need to make lifestyle changes and/or take medications. A family history of heart disease (age 45 or older for men; postmenopause for women), high blood pressure,smoking and diabetes are risk factors for heartdisease. Following a diet in which about 55 percent of calories come from carbohydrates, 15 percentfrom protein and less than 30 percent from fatcan help lower cholesterol. Also, cholesterolintake should be limited to less than 300milligrams per day by eating foods such as fruitsand vegetables, low-fat dairy products, low-fatstarches (breads, potatoes, cereals), lean meatsand no more than three eggs per week.In addition, weight reduction byreducing calories andincreasing exercise isimportant in reducingblood lipid levels. Several drugs are available to reduce bloodlipid levels. These include anew class of drugs such as atorvastatin (e.g.,Lipitor) or simvastatin (e.g., Zocor) to reduceblood cholesterol levels a greater degree thantriglycerides. Gemfibrizol (Lopid) is another classof drugs that reduces blood triglyceride levelsmore than blood cholesterol levels. Althoughthese drugs can be associated with muscleirritation, this problem is less likely with lowdoses. Patients need to be monitored closely forsigns of muscle injury and should contact thedoctor if they develop muscle pain or cramps.Unfortunately, these drugs have not beenapproved for use in children. Other strategiesunder investigation to reduce blood lipid levelsinclude steroid withdrawal and low-dosecyclosporine regimens. Elevated blood lipid levels are a common problem in transplant recipients. It is essentialthat you talk to your transplant physicianregarding the strategy that is best suited for youin order to reduce your blood lipid levels. TC A 14Transplant Chronicles, Vol. 8, No. 2Employment Following Transplantation and the Availability of Health Insurance By Charlie Thomas, ACSW , CISW new federal program will assist Social Security Disability(SSDI) and Supplemental SecurityIncome (SSI) beneficiaries inreturning to work by providingextended medical insurance andexpanding vocational rehabilitationand employment services. The Ticket to Work and Work IncentivesImprovement Act of 1999 was approved by Congress and signedinto law by President Clinton lastDecember. This program will be helpful to transplant recipients receivingSocial Security benefits who wantto return to work. One studyfound that approximately one-third of heart transplant recipients were willingand able to work, but were trapped by the risk oflosing Medicare or Medicaid coverage without anyguarantee that the new employer would offerhealth insurance. Congress has already passedthe Health Insurance Portability and Accountab- ility Act of 1996, that prohibits employer health insurance plans from denying coverage forpreexisting medical conditions for longer than 12months. The absence of guaranteed healthinsurance has been a major disincentive fortransplant recipients who want to work. This isof particular importance since transplantrecipients must take immunosuppressivemedications and have regular medical follow-upfor the rest of their lives. The Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Act, along with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act offers new opportunities for transplant recipients who are able and want toreturn to work. Effective October 2000, Medicare Part A coverage will be extended, premium-free, forrecipients who return to work beyond the fouryears currently provided for SSDI beneficiariesfor an additional four and one-half year period.Medicare Part B can also beextended for the same timeperiod by paying the regular PartB premium. This means thattransplant recipients receivingSSDI who return to work canextend their Medicare coverageup to eight and one-half years.This will be very helpful fortransplant recipients, sinceCongress has also extendedMedicare coverage forimmunosuppressive medicationsto 44 months following thetransplant under certaincircumstances. The Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act also gives states expanded options and funding forMedicaid \"buy-in \" for workers with disabilities. This option allows workers with disabilities tobuy into Medicaid even though they are nolonger eligible for SSDI or SSI disability benefitsdue to medical improvement. State Medicaid programs will collect premiums set on a slidingscale based on income. However, each state mustpass additional legislation in order to participate.The implementation date is also October 2000.Several states have already passed legislationand many others are studying the proposal. These medical insurance provisions are intended to support beneficiaries as a bridge toemployment. Recipients should feel encouragedabout returning to work, secure in theknowledge that their employment is notthreatened by fear of losing their healthinsurance. If you have questions about extendingMedicare, contact your transplant social workeror you may call the Social SecurityAdministration at (800) 772-1213.

TC A Transplant Chronicles, Vol. 8, No. 2 15eating right Blood Pressure Recommendations Change: DASH Diet Can Help igh blood pressure, which affects about one in four people in the United States, can lead toheart attack, stroke and kidney failure. Foryears, doctors have recommended four lifestylemeasures to help prevent or control high bloodpressure, or hypertension: reducing excessweight, reducing sodium (salt) intake, keepingalcohol intake to no more than two drinks a day(for those who drink) and getting regularexercise. A major study has now added a fifthrecommendation a diet rich in fruits, vegetables,low-fat dairy products and other low-fat foods. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Study, known as DASH, found that followingthis diet and watching salt intake produced arapid and significant drop in blood pressure, insome cases comparable to taking an anti-hypertensive drug. That means that many peoplewith high blood pressure who follow the diet maybe able to lower their drug dosage or, if theirpressure is only mildly elevated, avoid drugsentirely. (Never make changes in your medicationwithout discussion with your doctor.) $ $$ $High Blood Pressure Recommendations The DASH diet reduces both the diastolic and the systolic blood pressure. This is good newsbecause earlier this year the National Heart,Lung and Blood Institute launched a campaignto emphasize the seriousness of high systolicblood pressure, especially for adults who aremiddle-aged or older. While controlling thediastolic blood pressure (the bottom number)may count more for younger people, it is nowrecognized that as people get older, systolic bloodpressure (the top number) becomes moreimportant. The target blood pressurerecommended for people with hypertension is140/90. For people with both high bloodpressure and diabetes, the recommended goalhas been 130/85. A new report from theNational Kidney Foundation, published inSeptember 2000, recommends that this bechanged to 130/80. C CC CDASH Diet The DASH diet emphasizes fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy products, whole grains, nuts,poultry and fish, and is rich in potassium,calcium, magnesium and fiber. It calls forreductions in total fat (to about 27 percent ofcalories) saturated fats (6 percent of calories),cholesterol (150 milligrams a day) and red meats. By following the DASH diet for eight weeks and limiting sodium to 3,000 milligrams a day, peoplein the research study who had normal bloodpressure were able to reduce their systolic bloodpressure by 3.5 mmHg and their diastolic by 2.1mmHg. Those who had elevated blood pressure(almost a third of participants) had even moredramatic results in the two-month trial: theylowered their systolic blood pressure by 11.4mmHg and their diastolic by 5.5 mmHg. Lowering blood pressure is not the only benefit of the DASH diet. It may also help lower the riskof cancer, osteoporosis and diabetes. Newlyreleased data from the DASH study show that itreduces the level of the amino acid, homocysteine.A high blood level of homocysteine appears toincrease the risk of heart disease, stroke andperipheral vascular disease. If you choose to make changes in your diet, you should discuss them first with your physician andregistered dietitian to determine if they areappropriate for you; then make them gradually.One way to approach this is to concentrate onone food group at a time. The National Institute ofHealth recommended servings in each food groupare listed below. If the number of servings seemshigh to you, remember that a serving size is smallfor example, 1 slice of bread, 10 cherries, a halfcup of cooked carrots. Following are the recommended servings in each food group in the DASH Diet. All areservings per day unless noted: Grains/grain fish: 2 or lessFats and Nuts, seeds and legumes: 4-5 per weekTCH 16Transplant Chronicles, Vol 8, No. 2further down the road with our transplant, many individuals start to vary from the norm. It 's easy to see why. We start to feel much better and cando so many more things than we did prior totransplant. In some cases people have said thatthey have returned to a fully normal life.Seasoned, long-term transplant patients knowthis is not true. You can get close to normal butnever quite there. Possible long-term medicationissues or the chance of reoccurring diseases areusually the things that bring people back toreality. Choices\u2014 The process of varying from the norm is where some of us learn about choices. There are several kinds of choices.On-the-spot decisions, except in amedical emergency, are usually notthe best decisions. Our health carecan be very complicated and manyaspects need to be considered whenmaking major decisions. Informedchoices are the goal. We should beable to sit down with our healthcare team, a family member orfriend and discuss all options aboutan issue, then make a decision.Supporting our choice, even if you don't agree we 're making the best one, is a hard thing for many people. Patients can get a greatsense of control over their own life by makingtheir own choices. Our choices carry a bigresponsibility, however, we must take theresponsibility to learn about the issues andunderstand the consequences if things don 't work out as planned. The health care team mustbe honest and straightforward with us, andpresent material in a way that is easilyunderstood. Making choices in this manner is not for everyone. Many people don 't feel they are capable of getting very involved in their medicalcare. Others don 't want to be in a position of responsibility for themselves. It has been myobservation that well-informed people handleadversity much better and feel more in control oftheir life than people who have not taken theopportunity to explore their options and maketheir own choices. (Dedicated to the memory Tom Fortunato who taught me a lot about making choices).TCompliance, adherence and choices are three very simple words that we have all heard at somepoint in our lives. However, they can have verydifferent meanings and implications to those whosay them and those who hear them. This articlewill discuss these words as they may be used byus (transplant recipients), members of our healthcare team and family and friends. Let 's explore each one separately and then together. Compliance to certain people means doing exactly what someone tells them to do. The wordoften carries a rather harsh or judgmental tone,depending on the situation in which it is usedand by the tone of voice of the person saying it.Sometimes we feel that the healthcare team, our family and friends arewatching every move we make. Itseems that they are always naggingus about taking our medications,watching what we eat, keeping ourappointments, or lifting too muchweight, etc. The term \"non-compliant \" usually comes up in these situations.These people all have our bestinterest in mind, but it does notalways come across that way. It canseem that they don 't say anything when we are being \"compliant, \" but are right there to point out to us when we are not. Theyfeel they must remind us when we fail to live upto their expectations. To many people adherence and compliance mean the same thing. Literally,the words have the same meaning. However,adherence seems to have a softer, less judgmentaltone to it. Adherence seems to imply that the people who surround us have laid out the way they think weshould act in a certain situation, then watched tosee if we do \"the right thing \" for ourselves. I look at adherence as a bridge between compliance andchoices. In situations that involve both compli-ance and adherence, we are given informationabout how to act in a one-way conversation. Theperson usually says something like \"These are the things you have to do to keep your transplantworking. This is the way we do things at thistransplant center, \" or \"All our patients get these instructions at the time of discharge from thehospital. \" Many transplant recipients do well in this type of scenario for long periods of time. As we getCompliance, Adherence and Choices By Maurie Ferriter C Transplant Chronicles, Vol. 8, No. 2 17The \"Line \" continued from page 5 positive results. Donation will have become the \"right\" thing to do and it will feel good. All of the key individuals involved in the donation process will be reinforced every timethey see they have gotten someone from theircommunity out of that line and off the waitinglist. This is more likely to occur and easier toaccomplish, of course, when there is a localtransplant center serving the community whosepatients benefit from the community 's advocacy. For communities that do not have localtransplant centers evidence and reinforcement oftheir efforts is more difficult to recognize and theend results of their efforts are often less thanwhat is possible to achieve.

Organ Procurement Organizationsmust be poised and willing to invest time andresources for these community-based volunteerefforts. Finally, it is important to celebrate a community 's commitment and generosity towards one another. Many families have madethe decision to donate organs after their lovedone has died, and have benefited from theknowledge that they have saved lives \u2014maybe even someone close to them. Someone dies,someone gets off the list, and someone moves upon the list. These \"someone 's\" are part of a family and a community. They are critical to the grassroots effort of a sustained, productive, long-term and successful community organ donation program.

One reason patients areable to spend less time in the hospital is therange of services that can be provided by homehealth care companies. Therapies performed inthe home by capable home health care providersallow patients and their families the ability torecover in a more comfortable environment,maintain more normal routines and have lessexposure to hospital-acquired infections. There are many different home health care companies that provide services across thecountry. Do they provide the same services? Dothey provide the same quality of services? Dopatients and families have a choice ofcompanies? And if there is a choice ofcompanies, what should consumerslook for and what questions shouldthey ask in making the choice? Insurance companies often have a specific home health carecompany they contact for patientservices. If your insurance companyhas not provided you a list ofoptions, the transplant financialcoordinator, social worker ordischarge planner should have the information.In addition, your transplant team or primarycare doctor may be able to recommend a homehealth care company with which they have hadpositive experiences. The things that most health care providers look for in quality home health carecompanies include: IHow long has the company been treating transplant patients? IIs the company familiar with the transplant center 's approach to patient care? IAre the nurses familiar with the medications used by transplant patients?IDoes the company have nurses trained to understand the specific needs of transplantpatients (e.g., when to notify transplant center; knowledge of medication side effects;hyperalimentation and central lines)? IDoes the company provide a wide range of services to both in-state and out-of-statepatients? Other services for the patient and transplant team to consider are: IDoes the company have a system for tracking when to reorder medicationsand/or supplies? IHow often does the company check on patients and their needs? IDoes the patient have 24-hour access to a registered nurse and pharmacist? I If a special medicine or service has been ordered, can the companyobtain the medication or service? I Is the company willing to work with the patient and family to\"customize\" services and the plan ofcare for the best comfort of thepatient? IDo the company 's nurses provide a safe environment when performingpatient care? I Will the nurses know when something is wrong? When looking at services provided by different home health care companies, the mostimportant factor is how comfortable the patient,family and primary health care team are withthe available services, staff and patterns ofcommunications. Working together as a team,the patient and family, local physicians,transplant team and company should strive toprovide the best therapy in the safest and mostcomfortable environment. If questions ariseabout the different home health care companies,the transplant team or local physicians areready resources to provide you with informationto help you make the best decision for yourindividual needs. TCI Transplant Chronicles, Vol. 8, No. 2 19ach year consumers spend billions of dollars on herbal medicines. Because herbals arenot prescription medications, companies can makeunrealistic claims about their safety and how wellthey work. These drugs currently do not requireFood and Drug Administration (FDA) approval tobe put on the market. This creates a buyer-bewaremarket. Prescription medications in this country go through vigorous testing before the public can usethem. Studies are done to determine how effectivethey are with diseases such as kidney failure andliver failure. Drug interaction studies make sureeach new medication can be safely given withother medications. This is in complete contrast towhat is done with herbal medications. These substances may be dangerous. There is little data on drug interactions with other herbs,prescription or over-the-counter medications.When you use an herbal product that has multipleingredients in it, no one knows if they worktogether or work against each other. There isn 't a lot of data on how well these compounds work.period. There are, however, a lot of testimonialsfrom perfect strangers. Herbal medicine is not new. The Chinese have been using herbs for thousands of years. In theU.S. we have used herbs and plants to developdrugs. For example, digitalis is a successful heartdrug, but it was first extracted from purplefoxglove when farmers noted that cows were dyingafter eating the plants. Botanists and researchscientists have used herbs and plants as well assoil and animals to create many of the medica-tions your doctor prescribes today. They weren 't safe for people to use until studies were conductedto prove their usefulness because each of thesehad the potential to be dangerous if used in itsnatural form. In contrast to prescription and over the counter medications in the U.S., there is no guarantee thatthe herbal products you buy are pure. The label may say that each tablet or capsule has a strengthof the \"active\" ingredient, but the quality control islacking. There is the potential for ingredients thatdo not appear on the label to be added to theproduct. There is minimal safety data on herbal medications, especially in patients with specificdiseases. We have no idea what the activeingredient is in most products, and certainly haveno data on what, if any, chemicals from theherbals may build up in patients with kidneyfailure, liver failure, heart disease or a host ofother illnesses. These products may come labeled as \"natural \" or \"drug free, \" but the definition of natural is very liberal in this country. A natural product can bechemically altered during manufacturing and stillbe considered natural. A drug is any chemicalcompound that may be used on or administered tohumans or animals as an aid in the diagnosis,treatment, or prevention of disease or otherabnormal condition. In a nutshell, a drug issomething that you swallow, inject or apply to anypart of your body that causes some kind of changein your body. This means that all herbal productsare drugs. The FDA just considers them over-the-counter drugs. Finally, ask for proof before you try a product. Talk to your doctor and pharmacist aboutpotential and known drug interactions and sideeffects. Let them help you research the products.You should always talk to your doctor orpharmacist when taking any new medication \u2014 over-the-counter or prescription. Drew Silverman, Pharm.D.

Icouldn 't do the high jump if I couldn 't see. I walked over to the medical tent and asked if they couldfix my glasses, but the answer was no.They didn 't have the equipment to fix glasses. My heart sank.As I walked away, a young man said, \"Wait a minute, I picked up a tiny screw in anotherbuilding this morning. Let 's see if it is still in my pocket.\" He carefully took everything out of hispockets and finally found the tiny screw. Iwondered if the screw would fit my glasses. Iwondered if anyone had a tiny screwdriver I could use if it did fit. Again, the answer was no. I asked if anyone had a pocketknife and someone actually did! Incredibly, the \"donated\" screw fit perfectly and the pocketknife made a great screwdriver. I thanked theman profusely and wentback to the high jump area to compete. I won! Later, when I accepted the gold medal for the high jumpcompetition, I knew in my heart thatwinning the gold would not have been possible without the \"miracle\" of a \"donated\"screw.
