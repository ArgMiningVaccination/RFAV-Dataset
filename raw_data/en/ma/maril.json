Part of the comprehensive assessment work is to formally identify unmet health needs in the community. Community stakeholders helped to prioritize the unmet needs for further implementation strategy development. We are grateful t o all the community members who joined us in this important work. During 2016 members of the community were asked to complete a survey to help identify unmet health needs. Researchers at the Center for Social Research at North Dakota State University analyzed the survey data. WRHC further analyzed the data, identified unmet needs, and partnered with key community stakeholders to develop a list of resources and assets that were available to address each need. A gap analysis and prioritization exercise was also conducted to identify the most significant health needs and to further add ress these needs through the implementation strategies that are included in this document. WRHC h as set strategy to address the following community health needs: Healthcare Access Physical Health The report focuses on community assets as well as community health needs. T he asset map/resource list is included in this document along with the action steps that will be taken to address each identified need. At Winner Regional Healthcare Center, patient care extends beyond our bricks and mortar. As a not-for-profit organization, ensuring that the benefits of health care reach the broad needs of communities is at the core of who we are. Through our work with communities, we can bring health and healing to the people who live and work across our communi ties. Together, we can fulfill this mission. Sincerely, Chief Executive Offi cer Winner Regional Healthcare Center 3 Winner Regional Healthcare Center Community Health Needs Assessment 2016 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 4 Winner Regional Healthcare Center Community Health Needs Assessment 2016 Purpose A community health needs assessment is critical to a vital Community Benefit program that builds on community assets, promotes collaboration, improves community health, and promotes innovation and research. A community health needs assessment helps the community build capacity to support policy, systems, environmental changes and co mmunity health improvement. A community health needs assessment also serves to validate progress made toward organizational strategies and provides further evidence for retain ing not -for- profit status. The purpose of this community health needs assessment is to develop a global view of the population's health and the prevalence of disease and health issues within our community. Findings from the assessment serve as a catalyst to align expertise and to develop a Community Benefit plan of action. There is gr eat intrinsic value in a community health needs assessment when it serves to validate, justify and defend not -for-profit status and create opportunity to identify and address public health iss ues from a broad perspective. Study Design and Methodology 1. Non-Generalizable Survey A non -generalizable survey was conducted online during 201 6. The Center for Social Research at North Dakota State University developed and maintained links to the online survey tool. The website address for the survey instrument was distributed via e -mail to various key community stakeholders and agencies, at times using a snowball approach . Data collection occurred throughout the month of September 2 016 and a total of 88 respondents participat ed in the online survey. The purpose of this non -generalizable survey of community stakeholders was to learn about the perceptions of area community leaders regarding community he alth. The survey also explored the personal health of key stakeholders , preventive health, and the pre valence of disease. A Likert scale was developed to determine the respondent's highest concerns, with 1 as not at all and 5 meaning a great deal. Needs ranking 3.5 and above were included in the needs to be addressed and prioritized. Many of the identified needs that ranked b elow 3.5 are being addressed by WRHC and community partners. However, 3.5 and above was used as a focus for the purpose of the required prioritization. 5 2. Community Stakeholder Meeting Community stakeholders were invited to a meeting to review the early fin ding s from the survey and to discuss the top health issues or health -related issues facing the community. Community stakeholder s helped to determine key priorities for the community. 3. Community Asset Mapping Asset mapping was conducted by reviewing the data and identifying the unmet needs from the various surveys and data sets. Each unmet need was researched to determine what resources were available in the community to address the needs. Once gaps were determined the group proceeded to the prioritizatio n process. The multi -voting methodology was implemented to determine what top priorities would be further developed into implementation strategies. 4. Secondary Research The s econdary data includes Tripp County health profiles from the Robert Wood Johnson Co unty Health Rankings. The indicators that were reviewed for this assessment include: population data, vital statistics, adult behavioral risk factors, crime and child risk. Key Findings - Primary Research The key findings are based on the non -generalizab le survey data. Key indicators were ranked on a 1 -5 Likert scale, with 5 bein g the highest concern ranking. The s urvey results that rank ed 3.5 or above are considered to be the high est ranking concerns among the survey respondents. 1. Economics: Responden ts were most concerned about the availability of affordable housing. 2. Aging: The number one ranking concern among respondents overall is the cost of long term care. The availability of memory care, the availability of long term care, and the availability o f resources to help caregivers also rank as high concerns for the aging. 3. Children and Youth: When considering children and youth, bullying ranks highest of the concerns among respondents. Youth crime and the availability of quality infant and childcare ar e also ranked as high concerns. 4. Safety: The presence of street drugs and alcohol in the community, the presence of drug dealers in the community, child abuse and neglect, crime, and domestic violence are the highest safety concerns of the respondents. 5. Health Care: The health care indicator addresses access to health care and cost concerns. Concerns include access to affordable health insurance, affordable prescri ption drug s, affordable health care, and the cost of vision and dental insurance. Responden ts were also concerned about the use of the emergency room services for primary health care. 6. Physical Health : Cancer, chronic disease, obesity, inactivity and poor nutrition are the highest physical health concerns. 7.

The following needs were brought forward for prioritization: Economics Aging Children and Youth Safety Health Care Physical Health Mental Health/Behavioral Health Winner Regional Healthcare Center has determined the 201 7-2019 implementation strategies for the following needs: Health Care Physical Health 8 Implementation Strategies 1. Priority 1: Health Care Access Access to care includes the ability to gain entry into a health system or provider service. Access can include the ability of health care providers and a workforce available to address the needs. Limited access can challenge the ability to receive appropri ate levels of care and may pave the way to utilization of higher cost entry points into the system through the emergency room. 2. Priority 2: Physical Health Physical health consists of many components, including rest and sleep, nutrition, physical activity, and self-care. Primary prevention is a way to remain physically healthy. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, U.S. Department of Agriculture Guidelines for Americans, it is recommended th at individuals consume 3 to 5 servings of vegetables per day and 2 to 4 servings of fruit per day depending on age. A diet high in fruits and vegetables is associated with decreased risk for chro nic diseases. In addition, because fruits and vegetab les have low energy density (i.e. few calories relative to volume), eating them as part of a reduced -calorie diet can be beneficial for weight management. 9 Implementation Strategy for Winner Regional Healthcare Center (WRHC) FY 2017 -2020 Action Plan Priority 1: Health Care Projected Impact: Understand the needs of the community in order to provide the care that is most needed.

The population of Winner is 3,137 and the city covers approximately 922.5 acres of land. Winner was part of the famous Loui siana Purchase of 1803 and later part of the Dakota Territory, which was established by an act of Congress and a proclamation by President Abraham Lincoln in 1861. Winner was so named because it was the \"winner\" in the struggle to establish a town along th e railroad right -of-way when the Chicago North Western began moving west from Dallas, SD in 1909. Over 300 businesses are active in Winner and the Winner School District is rated level 1 by the South Dakota Division of Education with the high school accre dited by the North Central Association of Colleges and High Schools. Winner is home to a regional health care center and two modern assisted living centers. Recent capital improvements in the city include a new main street, new runway at the airport, and a new fire hall/ambulance facility with a new training room. 18 Study Design and Methodology 1. Non -Generalizable Survey A non -generalizable online survey was conducted by Winner Regional Healthcare with the assistance of public health leadership and the Center for Social Research (CSR) at North Dakota State University. The CSR developed and maintained links to the online survey tool. The website address for the survey instrument was distributed via e -mail to community stakeholders and various agencies, at times using a snowball approach . Data collection occurred throughout the month of September 2016 and a total of 88 respondents participat ed in the online survey. The purpose of this non -generalizable survey of community members and key stakeholders in the greater Winner, SD area was to learn about the perceptions of area community leaders regarding community health, their personal health, preventive health, and the prevalence of disease. This group included community leaders and agency leaders representing chronic disease and disparity. A Likert scale was developed to determine the respondent's highest concerns . Needs ranking 3.5 and above were included in the need s to be addressed and prioritized. Many of the identified needs that ranked below 3.5 are being addressed by WRHC . However, 3.5 and above was used as a focus for the purpose of the required prioritization. 2. Community Stakeholder Meeting Community stakehold ers were invited to a meeting to review the early finding s from the survey and secondary research, and to discuss the top health issues or health -related issues facing the community. Community stakeholder s discuss ed the community needs and helped to determine key priorities for the community. 3. Community Asset Mapping Asset mapping was conducted by reviewing the data and identifying the unmet needs from the various surveys and data sets. The process implemented in this work was based on the McKnight F oundation model - Mapping Community Capacity by John L. McKnight and John P. Kretzmann, Institute for Policy Research at Northwestern University. Each unmet need was researched to determine what resources were available in the community to address the nee ds. Sanford and community stakeholders performed the asset mapping review. The group conducted an informal gap analysis to determine what need s remained after resources were thoroughly researched. Once gaps were determined the group proceeded to the priori tization process. 4. Prioritization The multi -voting methodology was implemented to determine what top priorities would be further developed into implementation strategies. 5. Secondary Research The secondary data includes the Robert Wood Johnson County Health Rankings for Tripp County. 19 Limitations of the Study The findings in this study provide a limited snapshot of behaviors, attitudes, and perceptions of residents living in the Winner, SD area. A good faith effort was made to secure input from a broad bas e of the community. Invitations were extended to a wide base of county and city leadership, local organizations and agencies representing diverse populations and disparities. The findings in this study provide an overall snapshot of behaviors, attitudes, a nd perceptions of residents living in Tripp County, South Dakota . However, when comparing certain demographic characteristics (i.e., age, income, minority status) with the current population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau, it was evident that older, white, more highly educated, and higher income earners were overrepresented. Overrepresentation of this nature is typical in health needs assessments. Literature reviews indicate that there are non -response rate issues among younger respondents. In parti cular, response rates to health care and community health needs assessment surveys have often been found to be higher for older respondents. Studies have also shown lower response rates for socially disadvantaged groups (i.e., socially, culturally, or fina ncially). A good faith effort was made to secure input from a broad base of the community. Invitations were extended to county and community leaders, organizations and agencies representing diverse populations and disparities. The Internal Revenue Code 501 (r) statute requires that a broad base of key community stakeholders have input into the needs of the community. Those community members specified in the statute include: persons who represent the broad interests of the community served by the hospital facility including those with special expertise in public health; Federal, tribal, regional, state and or local health or other departments or agencies with information relevant to the health needs of the community served; leaders, representatives, or mem bers of medically underserved, low income, and minority populations. Winner Regional Healthcare Center extended a good faith effort to engage all of the aforementioned community representatives in the survey process. In some cases there were surveys that were submitted without names or without a specified area of expertise or affiliation. We worked closely with public health experts to develop the survey tool and throughout the assessment process. Public comments and response to the community health needs assessment and the implementations strategies are welcome on the Winner Reg ional Healthcare Center web at http://winnerregional.org 20 Key Findings 21 Community Health Concerns Economics The availability of affordable housing is a high concern for the respon dents of the survey.

For example, using the Body Mass Index (BMI) which calculates weight status using an individual's weight and height , the majority (68.3%) of respondents reported themselves as overweight or obese. However, the vast majority (91.9%) of community respondents rate their own health as excellent, very good, or good. With good overall health habits in mind, it is important to note that within the past year, 59 % visited a doctor or health care provider for a routine physical and 77.4 % visited a dentist or dental clinic. Respondents' rating of their health in general Obesity is a common, but serious disease. Obesity can have adverse effects on health and lead to a reduced life expectancy. Adults with a BMI over 25 are considered overweight and adults with a BMI over 30 are considered obese. According to the CDC, obesity and overweight are the second leading cause of preventable deaths, tagging close behind tobacco use. Health conditions related to obesity: Coronary heart disease Type 2 diabetes Cancers (endometrial, breast, and colon) Hypertension Dyslipidemia Stroke Liver and gallbladder disease Sleep apnea and respiratory problems Osteoarthritis Gynecological problems Nationally, more than 30% of adults, 17% of youth age 6 -19 years, and more than 8% of children 2 to 5 years of age are obese.

Screenings Breast cancer screening: According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), a mammogram is an X -ray of the breast. Mammograms are the best way to find breast cancer early, when it is easier to treat and before it is big enough to feel or cause symptoms. Having regular mammograms can lower the risk of dying from breast cancer. The U .S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that if you are 50 to 74 years old, be s ure to have a screening mammogram every two years. If you are 40 to 49 years old, talk to your doctor about when to start and how often to get a screening mammogram. Cervical cancer screening : Cervical cancer is the easiest gynecologic cancer to prevent, with regular screening tests and follow -up. Two screening tests can help prevent c ervical cancer or find it early: o The Pap test (or Pap smear) looks for pre-cancers, cell changes on the cervix that might become cervical cancer if they are not treated appropriately. o The HPV test looks for the virus that can cause these cell changes (human papillomavirus) (http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/hpv/basic_info/) o The P ap test is recommended for all women between the ages of 21 and 65 years old, and can be done in a doctor's off ice or clinic. Colo rectal cancer screening : Colorectal cancer almost always develops from precancerous polyps (abnormal growths) in the colon or rectum. Screening tests can also find colorectal cancer early, when treatment works best. Regular screening, beginning at age 50, is the key to preventing colorectal cancer. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening for colorectal can cer using high -sensitivity fecal occult blood testing, sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy beginning at age 50 and continuing until age 75. Prostate cancer screening : The American Cancer Society (ACS) recommends that men have a chance to make an informed decisi on with their health care provider about whether to be screened for prostate 31 cancer. The decision should be made after getting information about the uncertainties, risks, and potential benefits of prostate cancer screening. Men should not be screened unles s they have received this information. The discussion about screening should take place at: o Age 50 for men who are at average risk of prostate cancer and are expected to live at least 10 more years. o Age 45 for men at high risk of developing prostate cancer. This includes African Americans and men who have a first -degree relative (father, brother or son) diagnosed with prostate cancer at an early age (younger than age 65). o Age 40 for men at even higher risk (those with more than one first -degree relative who had prostate cancer at an early age). After this discussion, those men who want to be screened should be tested with the prostate -specific antigen (PSA) blood test. The digital rectal exam (DRE) may also be done as a part o f screening. If, after this discussion, a man is unable to decide if testing is right for him, the screening decision can be made by the health care provider, who should take into account the patient's general health preferences and values. Assuming no prostate cancer is found as a result of screening, the time between future screenings depends on the results of the PSA blood test . Men who choose to be tested who have a PSA of less than 2.5 ng/mL may only need to be retested every 2 years. Screening sho uld be done yearly for men whose PSA level is 2.5 ng/mL or higher. Because prostate cancer often grows slowly, men without symptoms of prostate cancer who do not have a 10 -year life expectancy should not be offered testing since they are not likely to bene fit. Overall health status, and not age alone, is important when making decisions about screening. Even after a decision about testing has been made, the discussion about the pros and cons of testing should be repeated as new information about the benefits and risks of testing becomes available. Further discussions are also needed to take into account changes in the patient's health, values and preferences. Skin cancer screening : The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has concluded there is not enough evidence to recommend for or against routine screeni ng (total body examination by a doctor) to find skin cancers early. The USPSTF recommends that doctors: o Be aware that fair -skinned m en and women aged 65 and older, and people with atypical moles or more than 50 moles, are at greater risk for melanoma. o Look for skin abnormalities when performing physical examinations for other reasons. Flu Vaccines The Center for Disease Control's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that everyone six months and older receive a flu vaccine annually. Findings from the survey indicate that 26.2 % of respondents did not have a flu shot last year . The Center for Disease Control states that influenza is a serious disease that can lead to hospitalization and sometimes even death. Even healthy people can get sick from the flu and spread it to others. Flu vaccines cause antibodies to develop in the body about two weeks after vaccination. These antibodies provide protection against infection with the viruses that are in the vaccine. 32 Fruit and Vegetable Intake The s tudy r esults suggest that the majority of respondents do not meet vegetable and fru it recommended dietary guidelines. Only 26.7 % of respondents reported having 3 or more servings of vegetables the prior day, and only 21.8 % respondents reported having 3 or more servin gs of fruits the prior day. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, U .S. Department of Agriculture Dietary Guidelines for Americans , it is recommended that individuals consume 3 to 5 servings of vegetables per day and 2 to 4 servings of fruit per day depending on age . A diet high in fruits and vegetables is associated with decreased risk for chronic diseases. In addition, because fruits and vegetables have low energy density (i.e., few calories relative to volume), eating them as part of a reduced -calorie diet can be beneficial for weight manage ment. Number of servings of vegetables, fruit, and fruit juice that respondents had yesterday Physical Activity Levels Study r esults suggest that the majority of respondents do not meet physical activity guidelines. 48.2 % of survey respondents engage in moderate activity 3 or more times per week and 16% engage in vigorous activity 3 or more times per week. Guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that individuals participate in 150 minutes of moderate physical activity per week or 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity per week to help sustain and improve health. 0.01.13.48.016.171.3 2.35.713.828.721.827.6 1.25.820.926.731.414.0 0 20 40 60 80 1005 or more4321None Percent*Number of servings Vegetables (N=86) Fruit (N=87) Fruit juice (N=87) 33 Number of days in an average week respondents engage in MODERATE and VIGOROUS activity Tobacco Use Study results indicate that the vast majority of community respondents are not currently tobacco users.

Mental health influences our physical health, how we handle stress, how we make choices, and how we relate to others. Among survey respondents , mental health is a moderately high area of concern . Dementia and Alzheimer's ranked the highest of concerns among respondents. Nearly o ne in five respondents ha s been told or diagnosed by a doctor or health professional that they have anxiety or stress . 15.9 % have been told they have depression . In addition, over half of respondents (52.3 %) self-report that in the last month, there were days when their mental health was not good .

Asset mapping was conducted by reviewing the primary and secondary research and identifying the unmet needs from the various surveys and data sets. Each unmet need was researched to determine what resources were available in the community to address the needs. The community stakeholders participated in the asset mapping and re viewed the research findings. The group conducted an informal gap analysis to determine what need s remained after resources were thoroughly researched. Once gaps were determined the group proceeded to the prioritization process. The multi -voting methodolog y was implemented to determine what top priorities would be further developed into implementation strategies. The process implemented in this work was based on the McKnight Foundation model - Mapping Community Capacity by John L. McKnight and John P. Kre tzmann, Institute for Policy Research at Northwestern University. The asset map includes identified needs from the following : Identified needs from the non -generalizable survey Concerns expressed by the key stakeholder group Secondary research data Commun ity resources that are available to address the need(s) The Asset Map can be found in the Appendix . Prioritization The f ollowing needs were brought forward for prioritization: Economics Aging Children and Youth Safety Health Care Physical Health Mental Health/Behavioral Health WRHC is addressing all of the assessed needs that fall within our scope of work. In some cases the need is one where we do not have the expertise to adequate ly address the need ; however , WRHC leaders will communicate these findings to community leaders and experts who can best focus on a solution to the concern. A document that shares what Winner Regional Healthcare Center is doing to address the need or defends wh y WRHC is not addressi ng the need can be found in the Appendix. Members of the community stakeholder group determined that health care access and physical health are the top unmet need s.

Priority 1: Health Care Access Access to care includes the ability to gain entry into a health system or provider service. Access can include the ability of healthcare providers and a workforce available to address the needs. Limited access can challenge the ability to receive appropriate levels of care and may pave the way to utilization of higher cost entry points into the system through the emergency room. 2. Priority 2: Physical Health Physical health consists of many components, including rest and sleep, nutrition, physical activity, and self - care. Primary prevention is a way to remain physically healthy. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Service s, U.S. Department of Agriculture Guidelines for Americans, it is recommended that individuals consume 3 to 5 servings of vegetables per day and 2 to 4 servings of fruit per day depending on age. A diet high in fruits and vegetables is associated with decr eased risk for chronic diseases. In addition, because fruits and vegetables have low energy density (i.e. few calories relative to volume), eating them as part of a reduced -calorie diet can be beneficial for weight management. 43 Implementation Strategy f or Winner Regional Healthcare Center (WRHC) FY 2017 -2020 Action Plan Priority 1: Health Care Projected Impact: Understand the needs of the community in order to provide the care that is most needed.

The following strategies were implemented . The 2013 stra tegies have served a broad reach across our community and region . The impact has been positive and the work will continue into the future through new or continued programming and services. 1. Impact of the S trategy to Address Physician Recruitment This first priority was determine d by the number of patients wanting to be seen in a timely manner (urgent vs. routine check -up). During the past three years, two physicians and two APPs (advanced practice provider s) have been added. At the same time the community lost two surgeons as wel l as an APP. Clinic access has improved slightly. This has been accomplished by lengthening the hours of availability by having a night clinic one day a week as well as adjusting provider schedules, due to office space shortages. Both adjustments have help ed. 2. Impact of the Strategy to Address Employee -Based Wellness Programs A Wellness Committee was established consisting of staff from numerous departments throughout the facility. The committee de cided on three areas to focus on: smoking, flu prevention and healthy nutrition . The programs were disseminated at a WRHC quarterly all-staff meeting. Staff was informed of successful smoking cessation programs provided by the State of South Dakota. Handouts were given to staff. Participation was en couraged by the Wellness Committee a nd reminders were placed on the communication boards throughout the facility. A new policy was approved by the Governing Board that required all staff to have a flu shot. This policy was to show the community that WRHC c ares about our patients and our community's wellness. The WRHC dietitian explained the eating healthy program and put together a pictorial of the effects of eating healthy. The storyboard was posted in the cafeteria so it would be visible to the facility's staff and the community as they decide on their food choices. 3. Impact of the Strategy to Address Chronic Health Issues in the Community The third focus was to evaluate the chronic hea lth issues in the community .
