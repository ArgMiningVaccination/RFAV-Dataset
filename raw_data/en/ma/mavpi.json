Ultimately, treatments are meant to not only ease pain and discomfort but help you feel better overall. At the Wellness Chiropractic Center, serving Watertown, WI, and the nearby region, we're your center for holistic health and wellness. The Difference Chiropractic Care with Us Can Make Chiropractic care, first and foremost, can help ease musculoskeletal pain and discomfort for both acute and chronic issues. Whether you have an injury or a case of arthritis, we can help with healing or pain management. Ultimately, our approach may help either optimize function and flexion after an injury or improve and maintain your current levels. This treatment approach is different from traditional medicine because it's designed to get to the root of the problem. Therefore, you see long-lasting results that are possibly unlike what you expected. We can help you see the difference we make as soon as you meet our staff. We're dedicated to our patients. We Take a Multifaceted Approach While some patients benefit from one treatment and one treatment alone, this isn't the case all the time. We're glad we can accommodate a variety of patients by being able to take a multifaceted approach that may include treatments like spinal adjustments, a standard chiropractic care treatment known for helping to optimize nervous system communication and function. On the other hand, we also offer spinal decompression therapy, which releases trapped nerves and compressed discs in the back, leading to healing and pain relief. Part of the care our chiropractor can help provide also includes nutritional counseling. Nutrient deficiencies can hinder healing and even cause pain and nervous system problems. Without the nutrients your body needs to heal, you might not recover to your fullest or as quickly. Our chiropractor understands nutrition's effects on the body and can determine if dietary changes could improve your condition, injury, or health. We can also help you with corrective exercises that can help encourage your body to function better while reducing your pain and other symptoms. It can also be part of preventative care.
