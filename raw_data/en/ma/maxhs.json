It is meant to be both a quick guide and also a more in-depth resource for residents and faculty as they have WSU students assigned to their service. It is organized in a quick \"need to know \" format with links to more in-depth information for reference. Background The WSUSOM has always recognized and appreci ated the fact that the vast majority of the clinical knowledge imparted on our students come from clinical faculty and residents. The near peer contributions of resident teachers joined with the experienced guidance of clinicians along with community prece ptors all combine to make for a great clinical education. This makes WSUSOM grads well prepared for entering the next phases of their training. The goal of WSU will always be the training of great clinicians , and this would not be possible without the seve ral thousand residents and faculty leading the effort. The clinical education of WSU students is spread out among a vast array of facilities \u2014outpatient and inpatient \u2014involving all the major health systems of southeast Michigan, multiple postgraduate progra ms, and diverse settings and experiences. Throughout this complex system, the SOM still sets the policies , procedures , and curriculum that unite this experience. Although the student experience at each site is never going to be the same, it is comparable for all students. It is our hope that this guide will be a concise but effective tool in uniting the experience across all settings. How to use this guide book: The guide is divided into need -to-know quick reference section s. This will include the overarchi ng course objectives for the core clerkship experience as well as the specific clerkship objectives for the individual courses. Also included are SOM policies and procedures that are often encountered, as well as common questions. Important information on evaluation procedures that lead to student grades are include d. In the second section there is information on the general organization of the curriculum at the WSUSOM that may be of interest or help for general knowledge as well as overall curriculum goals and objectives. Preface How the Students Are Prepared for Clerkships WSUSOM has a newer curriculum in the 18 -12-18 (months) model rather than the 2 + 2 (years) traditional setup. Over the first 18 months, in addition to a systems -based study of human phy siology, anatomy, and disease , the students are enrolled in a clinical skills course starting the first day of medical school. Correlated with the systems being studied in the classroom, the clinical skills course teaches the basic history and physical exa m skills -basic in the first year and advanced the second. These are with standardized patients and include written and oral case presentations. In the M2 year (April to December of year 2) the students are placed in outpatient clinical sites in the Clinical Experiential Course , to begin to see patients in a clinical setting. Their progress is evaluated and graded , and enrichment sessions are held for those needing added instruction. Thus , as the students start M3 year, they should be well prepared on th e basics of history and 2 physical examination, oral and written case presentation, and other basic skills. They are ready for clerkships and the honing of these and other skills to prepare them for residency. Prior to starting clerkships and while studying for Step 1 , all are enrolled in a Clerkships Preparation Course which builds on the earlier skills. Transitions Transitions between phases of medical education is an emphasis and interest of the SOM. Many members of the SOM were involved in writing an AMA guide on this , which is free to download at this link : American Medical Association (ama -assn.org) . This guide provides guidance from the executive coaching world on transitions in medi cal training from both the student side and the resident/faculty side. Overview of the M3 Year Starting on the first Monday of April, the clerkships continue for 12 months in 12-week blocks. 12 weeks Internal Medicine and ambulatory Medicine 12 weeks Sur gery , including specialty surgery and Anesthesia 6 weeks Obstetrics and Gynecology 6 weeks Pediatrics (inpatient and outpatient ) 4 weeks Family Medicine 4 weeks Psychiatry 4 wee ks Neurology All are also enrolled in a longitudinal course , CRISP (Clinical Re asoning, Integration and Skills for Practice) , through the year. This course meets monthly on Monday afternoons to cover topics common to all clerkships and integrative topics. 3 Part 1 : Need to Know Goals and Objectives of Clerkships As students progress through the core clerkships of M3, their instruction is guided by the goals and objectives. There are a set of overall objectives that are common to all clerkships. Student achievement is assessed by successful demonstration and fulfillment of these objec tives. Overall Goals and Objectives for the M3 Clerkship Year COMMON LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1. Identify the signs and symptoms of common clinical conditions. 2. Formulate clinical questions, access resources, and appraise evidence to improve unde rstanding and advance patient care. 3. Gather a focused and comprehensive history including a pertinent HPI, review of systems, core histories, and psychosocial factors. 4. Perform a relevant physical examination and other routine technical pro cedures. 5. Develop and rank the top 3 most likely differential diagnoses. 6. Recommend common screening tests, labs, and imaging required to advance patient care while minimizing risk and cost. 7. Interpret tests to distinguish normal fr om abnormal findings and identify the pertinent positive and negative findings that support the differential diagnosis. 8. Develop basic management plans including diagnostic, treatment, prevention, and pain -relieving strategies that integrate eviden ce and patient preferences. 9. Develop, present, and document organized, concise, and accurate patient records. 10. Identify situations the require a consultation or referral. 11. Enter orders and write prescriptions. 12. Advocate for patients and their families through counseling, resources, and other patient education efforts. 13. Identify patients requiring urgent or emergency care and inform a senior team member. 14. Build rapport with patients and families from diverse backgrounds thro ugh patient -centered communication, respect, trust, and empathy. 15. Collaborate with other health professionals to enhance and transition patient care. 16. Demonstrate a commitment to lifelong growth through resilience, self -evaluation, and professio nal identity formation. 17. Evaluate healthcare disparities that impact health outcomes in the patient, the community, and the region. 4 Goals and Objectives for Individual Clerkships Each clerkship has individual objectives essential to that specialty. These are established by the curriculum committee and clerkship directors and are in line with those established by the national organizations in each specialty. Interna l Medicine Surgery Obstetrics and Gynecology Pediatrics Neurology Psychiatry Family Medicine Emergency Medicine Senior Sub internship Require d Clerkship Cases and Procedures Each s tudent on the clerkship is required to complete a set of patient experiences and procedures (known as PxDx) that they track on New Innovations. Those who do not get a chance to complete these will complete an alternative experience \u2014we also track that \u2014altho ugh that is unusual that that is needed. It is important to note that these are minimums \u2014the student experience is much more complete and robust than these basic procedures . See full list of PxDX requirements by clerkship . Evaluation and Grading Importance of Learners from Multiple Schools WSUSOM understands and supports the fact that WSU students learn alongside students from other schools. This is almost always a win -win situation for student learning. How ever, it is important to distinguish the different schedules, objectives, and evaluation of students from the different schools so each student is properly evaluated. The following section outlines the details of our evaluation form. Feedback In the ideal state, each preceptor evaluating the student will meet briefly with the student to review their performance. The SOM value s negative and positive feedback in that all is necessary for growth. Formal evaluations are required at the end of the student's ti me on the service. Again , discussion of these evaluations with the student is ideal. More ideas for feedback are included on the feedback module available online at the FD4ME site ( see that section below for more det ails ). a. How an Evaluation Becomes a Grade Students can receive four grades in clerkships : Honors (H), Satisfactory with commendation (S+), Satisfactory (S), and Unsatisfactory (U). The final grades are determined by the WSU clerkship director and a gradin g committee. Basically , the grade is a combination of clinical evaluations from preceptors (residents and faculty) and the shelf exam score. Sometimes there are additional assignments and quizzes involved. Each clerkship course, by necessity, has customize d formulae for reaching this grade. Individual preceptors will rate the competencies. However , it is up to the clerkship director to compile these individual ratings and give an overall evaluation and grade. 5 Students may receive a grade of S+ (clinical) by exhibiting excellent performance on their clinical evaluations (with minimal criteria on the exams) or a grade of S+ (academic) by exemplary exam performance with clinical satisfactory. Outstanding performance in both phases is required for an Honors grad e. After preceptors submit evaluations, coordinators and clerkship directors compile evaluations and use various formulae and criteria to assign a final grade. These formulae and criteria differ by clerkship. The grade is then sent to enrollment management where it is manually uploaded into the mainframe system, and at that point made available to the student. This whole process must be done within two weeks. b. Online Platform for Evaluations Evaluation forms are all done in the New Innovations (NI) system. All evaluators in the WSU system will have a landing page on this system after they are entered. The Office of Enrollment Management at WSU has a help desk for all issues and can solve most problems with a si ngle email ( records@med.wayne.edu ). The NI system can be logged on through the Internet on a PC/Mac or through the smartphone link. There is a very convenient app available through the App Store and Google Play for free. This also allows users to dictate comments through the phone. Important note : Several hospitals use NI for resident evaluations also (notably the DMC). This is a different account and requires a different sign in and password (we still dream of a single sign -on). Be sure to use wayneume as the sign in institution to complete student evaluations and to look for your own teaching evaluations. c. Assignment of Evaluations There are three ways of getting an evaluation in you r inbox : 1. The clerkship coordinators assign an evaluation to you as a resident or faculty rounding or precepting the student. 2. The student assigns an evaluation form to you based on time spent together in the clinical setting 3. You assign yourself an ad hoc evaluation of the student. Note: in (1) a reciprocal evaluation will be assigned to the student to eva luate your teaching performance. In (2) and (3) the student will need to assign this evaluation to themselves. Since not every assignment of an evaluation is valid and sometimes a resident or faculty member cannot complete it due to lack of time or oppor tunity, there is an option to decline requested evaluation s. Preceptors receive notification of the evaluation via the email on file with NI. The first notification tends to end up in junk mail, but once the address is recognized as friendly, the notific ations and reminders are successfully sent and received . d. Nu mber of Evaluations The number of evaluations required differs by clerkship. On some clerkships (FM) the student may work with a single preceptor for the month , while on other clerkships they may work with several dozen residents and faculty. Students are encouraged to seek evaluations from everyone with which they have had sufficient contact in order to give a mostly complete evaluation. It is still possible to evaluate a student even if some com petencies were not observed. Also , with some short -term , one day evals (i.e., a shift in anesthesia) a short form may be used to document limited but still meaningful interactions. e. Time Course of Evaluation s It is necessary to complete evaluations as soon as possible after the student 's course or assignment to your service is completed. In order to comply with federal law, students must have their grades prior to getting 6 financial aid disbursement (i .e., loan checks) for the next quarter. Thus , grades need to be in the central repository system within two weeks of the end of the clerkship s. This necessitates that evaluation forms are completed within 2 -3 days of the end of the course, as it takes time for compilation , test grade results , and manual entry. In short, if we don't get our evals in, the students don't get their rent money! f. Completing an Evaluation Form Attestations and Role: After accessing the form on NI, you will be asked to attest your knowledge of the objectives and policies (i .e., this guide book) and , particularly, the mistreatment policy. You will check the estimate of the time spent with the student (1 day vs . 1 week, etc .) and also your role ( junior/senior resident or faculty). 1 4 competencies are then listed graded 1 to 5 (5 highest) with anchor statements for each rating. A 3 rating is minimal satisfactory mark for each rating. Rating a student below this mark \u20141 or 2 \u2014will usually need some explanatory comment to help the clerkship director develop a possible remediation plan. Competency Measures: As you complete this form, please note the anchors for each competency as a general guide. You may also note the student's status in the time course of the year \u2014i.e., students near the end of third year may have more expected of them. However , this will show in the overall course of the evaluations and the MSPE letter at the end of the year will reflect student's unquestionable progress. On the other hand, a student near the end of clerkships who is not on the path to overall competency will need to be noted so sufficient enrichment can be provided. Again , a rating of 3 is recognition of a student meeting the expectations of the competency. The anchors reflect that this is a student who usually or often demonstrates the competency. A rating of 4 requires a student to frequently demonstrate this , and a rating of 5 requires a student to consistently demonstrate the competency to greater than the satisfactory or minimal level. g. Competencies to Be Evaluated (general categories) History Taking Physica l/Mental Status Exam Synthesize Data/ Clinical Reasoning Formulate Plan from Diagnostic Data Oral Presentations Written Documentation Demonstration of Medical Knowledge Self -directed Learning Technical Skills/Handovers Determinants of Health Comm unication w/ Patients and Families Communication w/Healthcare Team Professionalism, Ethics w/ Patients Professionalism, Demeanor, Work Ethic RIME: Next is the opportunity to rate the student on RIME criteria. This will best characterize the student's role on the service as Reporter, Interpreter, Manager or Educator. Importantly, this is not a part of the grade and is 7 included as feedback to help in the overall development of the student through the year. Most students are reporters at the beginning and reach interpreters with practice and experience. Some reach the higher levels as the year progresses. h. Comments and Feedback Comments: Comments are required on the evaluation form. The f irst comments are usually positive and are meant to be included on th e MSPE letter to residenc y program directors (aka Dean 's Letter or Medical Student Performance Evaluation). WSU takes all of these comments almost verbatim and includes them on the letter for each clerkship. Comments Not for MSPE: The secondary comments are not for the MSPE. This section is included as some preceptors are sometimes shy about giving feedback that will help the student be a better doctor in fear that it will ruin their career somehow. For this reason , this section is included and the commen ts here are visible to the students but not included in their MSPE letters . This , of course , is valuable and encouraged. Students are coached to appreciate and take these suggestions to heart, and also to use them as part of an overall learning plan. i. Prof essionalism Reporting The last part of the evaluation gives the preceptor the chance to recognize good or bad professional behavior. First , for students with professionalism issues needing coaching or attention, they can be noted in this section . This will be brought to the attention of the clerkship and counselors so that we can help and intervene. Noting an issue here does not necessarily get the student in trouble \u2014it is an opportunity to note an observation that will possibly be helpful for the student. If there is a more egregious professionalism issue, we encourage formal reporting through the professionalism reporting form . This form goes into a WSU repository and is s ent directly to the professionalism committee chair and manager. If the preceptor has already counselled the student on this matter , this can be documented. The committee chair may meet with the student or invite the student to a formal hearing depending o n the situation. For a full list of professionalism standards, see Section 7 of the student handbook . PEARLS: On the brighter side , we also have a PEARLS (Professional , Empathetic, Accountable, Respectful, Leadership and Stewardship) A ward for students who go above and beyond in their professional performance. There is a link for nominat ions for this award on the form. j. Release of Evaluations Student evaluations are released to students promptly so they may use the feedback for improvement. Evaluations of preceptors (by students) are embargoed for 90 days so students do not need to fear \"retaliation\" and thus will give honest appraisal of our teaching performance. k. Midclerkship Evaluations Residents and faculty may be asked to complete a midclerkship evaluation form (formative assessment) for a student. These are required at the halfway po int of all clerkships. They includ e a student self -assessment 8 and a preceptor or director assessment of ways to improve the student's clinical performance. Final assessments/evaluation do not necessarily need to be identical to the midpoint evaluations . 9 Faculty Development and Feedback Resident and Faculty Preparation for Teaching 1. FD4ME (Faculty Development for Medical Education) a. All faculty (at the time of their appointments or renewals) are required to complete the initial modules at the WSU FD4ME site.

Download using the instructions in the press release (jitt-app -press -release -march - 2022.pdf (hofstra.edu) ) and expect to hear more about JiTT as we integrate use into the clerkships. Feedback and evaluation of faculty a nd resident teaching performance Residents and faculty preceptors are evaluated by students during clerkships and other courses. These evaluations are collated by New Innovations and tracked by the Office of Curricular affairs. The evaluations are embargoe d for 90 days following completion. This is , of course , done to allay student concern of retribution and to avoid quid pro quo concern with giving honest evaluations of resident and faculty. The evaluation form ( see appendix ) is based on teaching performance. Reporting 1. Self -Access : These evaluations are ALWAYS available to the individual faculty and residents through their New Innovations account and password. They are released 90 days after the course concludes, and thus may not show on NI immediately. They can be downloaded and collated using the software site for promotion and program director use. 2. Summary Reporting : Scheduled reporting of the evaluations are done centrally and sent to the residency program directors (throu gh the UGME/GME office at the respective affiliates). Resident evaluation reporting is done every 6 months while faculty is done yearly and sent to the affiliates. 11 3. Awards : The Office of Curricular Affairs sends teaching awards (certificates and/or pins) a nnually to the top -rated faculty and residents. These awards are purely based on the numbers as the actual numerical scores from the evaluation forms are used for ranking. Approximately the top 10% of faculty and residents receive this recognition from the students. Awards are sent in May of each year, after completion of the clerkship year (and some math calculations). Policies and Procedures Commonly Referenced Note that these are highlights of policies that frequently come up on clerkships A complete set of policies and procedures are always available in the Student handbook at this link : Wayne State University School of Medicine MD Handbook and Policies 2022 -23 1. Duty Hours Duty Hours and Work Environment Policy The following was adapted from the ACGME Duty Hours and Working Environment recommendations and apply to WSUSOM medical students doing clinical training at all of our clinical sites. Segment 3 Duty Hours Duty h ours are defined as all educational activities in clerkships and electives during Segment 3 and 4 of the medical school curricula , including inpatient and outpatient care, administrative activities related to patient care (charting, discharge planning, tra nsfer planning, etc.), and scheduled educational activities such as conferences, rounds, etc. Duty hours do not include reading and preparation time spent away from the duty site. Both students and their supervising attending faculty and residents are remi nded that medical students are here in an educational capacity . They are not on the floors, clinics, etc. to provide indispensable patient care. Consequently, there may be times when the educational requirements of the program dictate that patient care ti me be curtailed to allow students to attend scheduled conferences, lectures , and other required educational activities. Duty hours will mirror those published by the ACGME as of March 2017 outlined as follows: Duty hours must be limited to 80 hours per w eek, averaged over a 4 -week (one month) clerkship or elective. These 80 hours include in -house call activities. o For example, a student may work 90 hours in one week, 60 hours in the next week, and two 75-hour work weeks during a 4 -week (one month) clerkshi p. The average of 75 hours per week satisfies the above rule. o Two 90 -hour work weeks and two 70 -hour work weeks also satisfy the above rule. Students must be provided with 1 day off in 7, free from all educational and clinical responsibilities, averaged ov er a 4 -week (one month) clerkship or elective, inclusive of call. o For the purposes of this policy, 4 -week periods of a clerkship are treated the same as a one - month elective. o For 2 -month clerkships, the rules stated herein apply to each of the 4 -week (one month) portions of the clerkship. o One day is defined as one continuous 24 -hour period free from all clinical, educational and administrative activities. 12 For example, a student is required to work from Monday through the following Friday (12 days) and then gets the entire following weekend off. The two days off that weekend satisfies the requirement that the student has one day off in 7. Call : overnight call will be scheduled no more frequently than every third night. Adequate time for rest and personal acti vities must be provided. This should consist of a 10 -hour time period provided between all daily duty periods and after in -house call. On-Call Activities The objective of on -call activities is to provide medical students with continuity of care experiences and additional patient care experience that would not be available during a regular workday. On-Call activities that do not meaningfully provide for this objective should be critically evaluated and terminated from the medical school schedule. In -house ca ll is defined as those duty hours beyond the normal work day when students are required to be immediately available in their assigned institution. In-house call must not occur more often than once every 7 days averaged over the 4 -week period. Continuous in -house call does not have a limit number of hours per on -call event. Rather, the policy of a maximum of 80 hours/week averaged over 4 weeks and one day off every 7 days averaged over 4 weeks must be followed. On some services, overnight \"night shift\" or \"n ight float\" are required due to the nature of the service. These are subject to the aforementioned limits of 80 hours/week and 1 in 7 days off. Every effort is made by the clerkship to work didactic activities around these schedules. Reporting of Duty Hour s Violations Responsibility for reporting of Duty Hours Violation lies with the student. Students should report a violation of duty hours by logging into New Innovations and going to the forms tab. The duty hour violation form is located there. The form sh ould be filled out when the duty hour violation occurs. The report is automatically sent to the Clerkship Director and the Associate Dean of Clinical Education at the time of student submission. The Clerkship Director and/or Associate Dean of Clinical Educ ation will address the violation at the time of occurrence and record results in New Innovations 2. Mistreatment The School of Medicine strives to create a safe and supportive learning environment that reflects the Institution's values: professionalism, respe ct for individual rights, appreciation of diversity and differences, altruism, compassion , and integrity. We are committed to maintaining an educational and professional environment that is free of all forms of harassment and discrimination and take the rights of our students very seriously. Incidents of medical student mistreatment are addressed following the reporting process below: TO REPORT MISTREATMENT: 1. DISCUSS it: Counselor, Associate Dean of Student Affairs, Assistant Dean of Basic Science, Assistant Dean of Clinical Education, WSUSOM clerkship/course director, hospital system clinical campus Director of Medical Education, OR the Office of Ombudsman at WSU 2. FILE a School of Medicine Report: a. File a report anonymously or self -disclosed via the following link: https://cm.maxient.com/reportingform.php?WayneStateUniv&layout_id=37 The form will be received by the Associate Dean of Student Affairs. All investigations are conf idential, and your information is protected during any follow -up activities. If you would like to receive feedback about the outcome of your concern, please provide your name. If you are not comfortable providing your name 13 but would still like follow up of any outcomes concerning your complaint , you may create an anonymous or disposable email address on the form. Examples of Mistreatment : Students should use this Mistreatment Policy to address discriminatory, unfair, arbitrary or capricious treatment by faculty, staff, students, clinical teaching faculty , and medical personnel. The school adheres to the professional standards of behavior established by the Association of American Medical Colleges and the Wayne State University Nondiscrimination Policy (referenced in III.c.) http://oeo.wayne.edu/pdf/affrm_actn_policy.pdf . Students are expected to report behavior which interferes with the learning process. Students should consider the conditions, circumstances and environment surrounding the behavior. Examples of discriminatory, unfair, arbitrary or capricious treatment include, but are not limited to: * 1. Physical a. Physically mistreated causing pain or potential injury b. Pushed/slapped han d (\"get out of the way communication\") c. Exposed to other forms of physical mistreatment used to express frustration, make a point or get attention 2. Verbal a. Accused b. Threatened/intimidated c. Yelled at/snapped at d. Degraded/ridiculed/humiliated/sworn at/scolded/bera ted e. Exposed to inappropriate conversation/comments (of nonsexual and nonracial nature) 3. Sexual harassment a. Making sexual comments, innuendo, jokes, or taunting remarks about a person's protected status as defined in the University's Nondiscrimination Policy Statement. (referenced in III.c.) b. Making sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct or communication of a sexual nature as per the University Sexual Harassment Policy c. Ignored because of gender d. Stalking of a sexual nature; i.e. persistent and unwanted contact of any form whether physical, electronic or by any other means. 4. Ethnic a. Exposed to racial or religious slurs/jokes as defined in the University's Nondiscrimination Policy Statement. (referenced in III.c.) b. Stereotype d c. Neglected/ignored (because of student's ethnicity) 5. Power a. Dehumanized/demeaned/humiliated (nonverbally) b. Intimidated/threatened with evaluation or grade consequences c. Asked to do inappropriate tasks/scut work d. Forced to adhere to inappropriate work schedules e. Neglect/ignored *list adapted from Fried et. al, Academic Medicine, Sept 2012 Please note: When one party has any professional responsibility for another's academic or job performance or professional future, the university considers sexual relationships between the two individuals to be a basic violation of professional ethics and responsibility; this includes but is not limited to sexual relationship 14 between faculty and student or between supervisor and student, even if deemed to be mutually consenting relationships. Because of the asymmetry of these relationships, \"consent\" may be difficult to assess, may be deemed not possible, and may be construed as coercive. 3. Supervision of students in clinical activity The Wayne State University School of Medicine values the role of learners in the provision of clinical care. We also value the educational principle of graded responsibility to maximally support learners in their development of clinical expertise. For this to occur, we re quire that appropriate supervision, assessment, and feedback of learners occur. All Wayne State University School of Medicine students must be appropriately supervised when participating in required or elective clinical activities. Supervision must occur b y a physician who must either possess a Wayne State University School of Medicine faculty appointment or be supervised in their teaching and assessment role by an individual who has a Wayne State University School of Medicine faculty appointment. These ind ividuals can include but are not limited to physicians, residents, fellows, or other licensed health professionals. Student 's level of responsibility while being supervised is based on the Public Health Code of the State of Michigan. The Public Health Code of the State of Michigan allows licensed practitioners to delegate activities and procedures of medical care to medical students while under the direct supervision of the licensed practitioner who is physically present. The students are required to be enr olled in an approved school of medicine and be participating in medical care as part of a course of study. WSUSOM Medical students may therefore write orders for drugs, treatments, etc., provided that: 1. They are under direct supervision of a licensed physic ian and are doing so within the approved medical school course of study; 2. They are compliant with the policies of the clinical partner hospital, clinic, practice site or other provider organization. Students may not write prescriptions if otherwise prohibit ed by hospital/clinic/practice site policy; 3. The students are assigned to or are consultants to the service on which the order pertains; and, 4. A licensed physician countersigns all orders before the orders are executed. Counter signatures via the electronic medical record must likewise be done before the order is executed. a. Routine admission orders are not exempted from the above provisions. b. Students are not allowed to enter orders in the electronic medical record while signed in using another's credentials, a nd permission to do so by the licensed practitioner is not valid. c. All activity must be in compliance with Michigan Controlled Substance laws. d. Medical students acting as sub -interns are still subject to the above provisions. Medical students will identify t heir signatures with WSU II, III or WSU IV or MS (Medical Student) III or IV, just as licensed physicians identify their signatures with MD. Medical students will also wear badges identifying them as medical students. Medical students are not to be involve d in any portion of the medical care of other medical students. As part of professional behavior, students should recuse themselves from involvement in medical care of family members or acquaintances. At all times, if a student is uncomfortable performing an assigned procedure because they feel either that their skills are inadequate or that they need more supervision/guidance than is available, then that student MUST refrain from doing the procedure. Students should never attempt a procedure on a patient t hey are uncomfortable performing. 4. Student absences Mandatory Attendance Policy for Clerkship Orientations 15 Students are required to attend the entire Clerkship Orientation Session for each of their required Segment 3 and Segment 4 clerkships. Any student wh o does not attend a Clerkship's Orientation Session will be prohibited by the Clerkship Director from participating in that clerkship for the scheduled period and may have their entire schedule of clerkships revised by the Associate Dean of Clinical Educat ion as deemed necessary to meet WSUSOM academic requirements. Wayne State University School of Medicine recognizes and appreciates the diverse cultural and religious backgrounds of its students. Approved holidays are identified by the University. Everyone is off on those days, and students are not required to be at their Segment 3 clerkships on those days. However, there are no official days off during student's Segment 4 required clerkships, rotations, and electives. For students on clinical rotations, all days off are determined by the clinical service the student is assigned to for each month. Requests for time away from clerkships and electives must be submitted in writing to the student's counselor as soon as possible upon knowing of the need for an exc use. The student's counselor will work with the student to contact the Clerkship/Elective Director to request the time off if the request is considered appropriate. The counselor and student will work with the Clerkship/Elective Director to determine how /if the time can be made up. Excused absences may not be granted by the Clerkship/ Elective Director if this policy is not followed. Excused absences for non -medical reasons (including weddings, family gatherings, travel, vacation) are not granted. The excep tion is presentation of the students own scientific work at local or national meetings. A guideline for excused time off for these meetings is one day for local and two days for national meetings, including travel to and from the site. This allows for the student to present their scientific work and get a flavor of the meeting. Attendance for the entirety of a meeting is usually not possible if it does not conform to these time constraints. Notably , travel to international or distant (e.g., Hawaii) meetings is not possible because of the travel times required. One student per paper/poster will be allowed to be excused. Attendance at meetings that do not involve presentation of the student's own scientific work is not a valid reason to request an excused ab sence. Students' attendance is expected and required at all other times by the faculty and the Clerkship Director or Elective Coordinator for satisfactory completion of each clinical clerkship or elective. Not appearing for clinical responsibilities and as signments is unprofessional as well. Indeed, unexcused absences will severely affect the clerkship grade; as detailed in clerkship syllabus, students may fail a clerkship or elective if they do not show up for an assigned activity, miss a call, etc. If for any reason clinical time is missed for illness, family emergency, weather delays, etc., the student is required to notify the supervising attending, resident or other primary individual to whom the student will report for that shift, the clerkship coordin ator , and the Clerkship Director or the Director's designee immediately. Communication must occur as soon as possible before the start of clinical duties or required academic event via email, telephone, or text, as appropriate. When communicating the absen ce, the following information must be conveyed: the nature of the absence and the expected return date. Having notified these individuals, it is still the student's responsibility to obtain an excused absence from the Office of Student Affairs. To do so, t he student must contact their counselor or the Associate Dean of Student Affairs and Career Development. When the student returns from an excused absence, the student will discuss making up the missed clinical time with the Clerkship Director. In the event of 4 -5 missed academic days due to illness, family emergency, weather delays, etc., students will be required to make up the same number of academic days of the rotation, respectively. In addition, the clerkship or course director will review the student' s performance to determine whether learning goals can be met by the end of the clerkship or course. If learning goals cannot be met, the clerkship or course must be repeated. In the event of more than 5 missed academic days due to illness, family emergency , weather delays, etc., the student will work with the Associate Dean for Clinical Education to develop an alternate make -up plan. If the missed 16 time is a considerable percentage of the clerkship days, it may be necessary to repeat part or all of the clerk ship. Quarantine time will be addressed individually, and missed competencies may be made up with M4 work. Failure to do so will result in an unexcused absence. 5. Wellness days In order to install some breaks for life events, celebration of religious holiday s, or to get a break from the clerkships, the WSUSOM allows wellness days for M3 students on clerkships. These days are limited to one every 12 -week block. The student will apply for these on a university Maxient website. They must also have permission from their clerkship, site , and team. Wellness days must be requested two weeks in advance. They cannot be taken on the first or last day of the rotation, nor as an additional study day during the last week of the clerkship. They should not be used for medic al appointments or care as these are separately allowed by the excused absence policy (through the student counselor). Other than recording these on the university website system, no other permission from Student Affairs is needed. The student use of these is closely monitored to avoid irregular use, which would be brought to the attention of the professionalism committee. 6. Needlestick policy In the event that a student is stuck with a needle or other sharp instrument or sustains exposure to a body fluid on mucus membranes or non -intact skin, the student must report this to their senior resident, attending physician, or supervising faculty member immediately. As detailed below, a written report must be completed detailing the circumstances of the exposure an d the student must notify the WSUSOM's Medical Student Health Officer of the reported incident via email at: MDHealthRecords@wayne.edu . The medical school has established relationships through the affiliatio n agreements with all of our clinical site facilities (hospitals and ambulatory sites). Specific policies must be followed when an exposure or potential exposure has occurred: A student who sustains an exposure to blood and/or body fluids in the course of a clinical assignment at any of our affiliated clinical institutions should immediately seek care in the designated department of that facility. These departments are listed for each institution on the back of the laminated cards that are distributed at Se gment 3 Orientation. This list should be kept for potential use during Segment 4. If the incident occurs outside of the regular business hours of the institution's designated department the student should receive initial evaluation and treatment in that in stitution's Emergency Department. A student who suffers an injury or exposure while on a \"Home\" required or elective rotation that is not taking place at an affiliated clinical site facility (e.g. a rotation taking place in a faculty physician's office) sh ould seek care in the nearest emergency department. All injured students must complete a short Wayne State University Report of Injury form. Students must also sign and date the very bottom of the form. This form is available online . o NOTE: The Report of Injury form must be submitted within 48 hours of the injury. Completed forms should be submitted to the Medical Student Health Officer at: MDHealthR ecords@wayne.edu . The Medical Student Health Officer will forward the form to the WSU Office of Risk Management on the student's behalf. The WSU Office of Risk Management will cover the expenses of the first emergency department visit as long as the Repor t of Injury has been submitted to the Medical Student Health Officer within the prescribed 48-hour post -injury time frame. 17 When completing paperwork in the emergency department, students should show their laminated card that ensures that Wayne State Univer sity will be responsible for the professional and facility charges related to the initial visit for evaluation and treatment in the department. Any expenses incurred (co -pays, deductibles) based on a failure to adhere to the above process will be the respo nsibility of the student . After the initial evaluation and treatment encounter at the clinical institution, the student will subsequently follow -up with their personal physician using their own health insurance coverage within five days of the incident. Any questions regarding this policy should be addressed to the Medical Student Health Officer at MDHealthRecords@wayne.edu . 7. Snow days The SOM follows official University Closures/Remote Day Policies but mainta ins discretion to make independent determinations for essential curricular elements in coordination with Main Campus Administration. Rationale: Due to the unique and complex nature of the MD Curriculum, a shift to remote instruction may not be feasible and jeopardize essential learning, especially in the clinical care setting. Remote operations may also be irrelevant in the MD learning space as many students are geographically dispersed for clinical rotations unequally affected by local weather patterns or students are scheduled for shifts out of sync with normal workday hours. An automatic default to extraction of medical students from their tailored learning environment results in loss of valuable clinical and professional skills training that can often no t be reclaimed. Accordingly, all efforts will be made to maintain and model the duty, routines, and practices expected for physicians -in-training towards their profession, patients, and society. Thus, in coordination with university administration, the SOM may exercise the latitude to maintain previously scheduled clinical activities or on -site examinations. Independent Determinations for Essential Curricular Elements: All core M3 Clerkships and Senior Clinical Rotations are pre -determined Essential Curricu lar Elements. Continuation of any additional curricular elements deemed essential during a university closure will be determined by the respective segment directors in collaboration with the associate deans for clinical education and Student Affairs. Expec tations will be clearly and timely communicated to students via the class -appropriate listservs or established portals by the course/ segment/ clerkship directors. It is the responsibility of students to check their emails and relevant class/course communica tion portals for awareness of any such independent determinations from the SOM once an Inclement Weather Alert has been issued by the university. The SOM expects that, as physicians in training, students will balance their professional responsibilities wit h common sense to develop personal decision -making. As such, if a medical student feels they cannot safely make it to the medical campus, hospital, or clinical site for a determined essential curricular element (including examinations) during a university -issued closure/remote day, they are to contact their clinical team/preceptor or class counselor for an excused absence as indicated per the specific guidance below. As with any absence, students are expected to make -up that missed essential curricular elem ent in coordination with their course director/preceptor. CLERKSHIP PHASE 18 Medical Students are assigned to the clinical campus sites and thus follow the routines and practices of clinicians. As such, all clinical rotations and duties are deemed Essential C urricular Elements. Clerkships and hospital sites have agreed to be lenient for situations that students may feel are unsafe. The SOM expects that, as physicians in training, students will balance their professional responsibilities with common sense to de velop personal decision -making on these issues at this advanced stage in their medical education. During an official university inclement weather/remote day closure only: If the students feels that they cannot safely make it to the hospital or clinical sit e, students are to contact their team or preceptor rather than their class counselor as this will not be recorded as an unexcused absence. Students excused for inability to traverse to their assigned sites during remote operations for inclement weather bas ed on their best judgement will not be adversely graded with active surveillance by the associate dean for clinical education/Curricular Affairs Office. However, as for any absence, the clerkship director or hospital team may instruct you to make up the ti me missed. If the university is otherwise open (not weekends or holidays), students must get an excused absence from their counselor for any missed days other than official WSU inclement weather closures. For severe snow storms occurring on days the Univer sity is not open (weekends, holidays), students should directly contact their faculty supervisor/rounding team to notify them if they will not be in due to hazardous weather conditions. Segment 3 and Segment 4 students may be required to make up clinical t ime that is missed at the discretion of the WSUSOM clerkship director. 8. Institutional Holidays WSUSOM has a number of institutionally recognized holidays, including the following: New Year's Day (observed); Martin Luther King, Jr. Day; Memorial Day; Fourth of July; Labor Day; Thanksgiving and the day after Thanksgiving; and Christmas Day (observed). During the clerkship and M4 elective phases, all WSUSOM institutional holidays are observed from 5 pm the day before to 5 pm the day of the holiday to accommodat e clinical call schedules in the M3 year. Students may be expected to report to clinical duties at 5 pm on the day of the institutional holidays. M4 students are expected to follow the procedures of their site. 9. Professionalism reporting The WSUSOM professi onalism policy is in Section 7 of the student handbook . Reporting of violations of professionalism is necessary. Not every instance will lead to dire consequences for the student, and all are reviewed. Students will always receive due process under university rules, policies, and procedures. Thus , reporting is encouraged so the school is able to intervene and help shape professional identity formation in all of our stud ents. It is also important to note that many professionalism issues among medical students reflect something else going on. Substance use , family and economic issues, academic problems , and psychological stressors are often at the root of these issues ; and prompt reporting to the SOM can get the students help and intervention. Indeed , the professionalism process is meant to be a positive intervention for students and identify students in need. Many of these issues occur only in clerkships when the student i s distant from the school. Reporting helps support the students and gets them connected to university resources. WSUSOM maintains the Maxient software for tracking student performance, including professionalism. The link for this form is well distribute d and is on every New Innovations evaluation form and the home page. Professional Performance Review Referral Form (SoM) (maxient.com) 19 The SOM maintains a professionalism committee (as a subcommittee of the promotions committee) to oversee professionalism issues. The chair of this committee evaluates reports of violations. What happens? There are three tiers of intervention for professionalism issues. 1. Tier 1: Coaching/di scussion (AKA the cup of coffee meeting to discuss improvements ). This can often take place at the hospital or clerkship; in which case it would be documented on the Maxient form. 2. Tier 2 : Meeting with Student/Curricular affairs (AKA trip to the principal's office). The student record will be reviewed, information gathered, and a course of intervention or monitoring started. A holistic review of the whole situation will usually lead to a plan, intervention, help, or other progress. 3. Tier 3: Egregious violatio ns should be reported promptly. More often a repeated pattern of behavior will prompt a hearing with the committee with possible action by the promotions committee. In summary, the professionalism reporting structure is more supportive than punitive as the SOM continuously strives to instill the values of the professional physician into our physicians in training. 20 Part 2.
