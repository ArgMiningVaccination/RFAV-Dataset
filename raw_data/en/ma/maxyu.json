The skin of our face is exposed day and night, unlike other areas that we usually cover with clothing. In addition, it is one of the most delicate and sensitive skin on our body, so it is very important to give it the care it deserves. And the thing is, showing off radiant skin isn't just an aesthetic issue, as it can reflect a lot of things.# And, one of the signs that perhaps things are not going so well are precisely the spots on the face. Something that is more common in people over 50 years old, but may appear earlier due to various factors. Various types of spots also occur on the skin. Madeleine de Quevedo, CEO and director of the company Clinic Acorpusspecializing in aesthetic medicine and outpatient surgeryexplains that \"there are those who darker and which are usually generated irregular production of melanin and are called hereditary factors or also due to excessive sun exposure And for not using sunscreen. This category includes freckles and moles. Hormonal changes can also cause these types of spots, as well as acne marks. There are also pink spots, They are especially visible on the cheeks. \"They might be talking about rosacea, a skin condition that, while not fatal to anyone and not contagious, can cause a woman to suffer emotional repercussions, lose self-confidence and even end up isolated. Now these pink shades and on the face They can talk about bad habits like smoking or eating too much leather and even stress. Other causes of these spots on the face: allergic processes or infections\"adds a professional. But also there are other colors of spots, for example, yellow. They are usually associated with conditions such as hepatitis, diabetes mellitus, cirrhosis of the liver. Bruises usually associated with bruising And whiteassociated with skin diseases such as atopic skin, vitiligo or hypomelanosis. Faced with such a scenario, the specialist notes that \"the most responsible thing is that The patient always turns to a competent specialistwhich in this case will be a dermatologist so that he can give you an accurate diagnosis of spots on the face or on another part of the body. Can stains be prevented? The answer is yes, in the vast majority of cases. And for this, the Acorpus specialist gives the following recommendations for the whole year. 1- Daily facial cleansing in the morning/evening: Facial cleansing in the morning and evening should be part of our daily routine. To do this, you can use micellar or thermal water or soap, ideally without perfume and alcohol, since the skin of the face is sensitive and easily irritated, especially if we have been diagnosed with a disease such as rosacea. 2- moisturize the skin: It is very important to use a good moisturizer suitable for our skin type, ideally dermatological and non-comedogenic. To this must be added the consumption of water. On the other hand, thermal water is also a good way to stay hydrated as it also contains minerals that help keep our skin healthy. 3- Use of sunscreen: It is our duty every day, whether it is sunny or not, and even if we do not leave the house, because exposure to screens such as computers, mobile phones or televisions can also damage our skin and leave stains. This. Opt for FP50 sunscreen. Reapply sunscreen as many times as needed. 4- Deep facial cleansing: Every 15 days or once a month, I recommend this treatment, which effectively removes impurities from our skin. At Acorpus we also offer VIP facial cleaning to which a diamond tip is added, therapy in combination with ampoules with active ingredients. 5- Intensive update: This is another procedure that we highly recommend and offer at Acorpus. It consists of 4 sessions that promote cell renewal and also reduce wrinkles. It is a treatment consisting of facial hygiene, platelet-rich plasma and firming mesotherapy. 6- Take care of your food: Our skin is also a reflection of our diet. There are certain foods that help us to have healthy skin, including: avocados, tomatoes, salmon, nuts, foods rich in vitamin C such as oranges. Now there is another option which is intravenous therapy for example, a megadose of vitamin C. A patient is given intravenous vitamin C, the weight and number of sessions vary with each patient and depend on the reason the vitamin is administered. It has a number of benefits, including improving the health of our skin as it promotes collagen production. But what if we already have stains? Can they be removed? Magdalena de Quevedo, CEO and Director Clinic Acorpus, explains that \"yes, they can indeed be removed with laser treatment. It can be one or more sessions, depending on the type and size of the spot,\" he emphasizes. Now, regarding the effectiveness of the \"anti-stain\" products on the market, the specialist emphasizes that \"only products of well-known dermatological brands are effective, since although others are much cheaper, they do not have the right concentrate to really work,\" he concludes. .
