Employers are required to collect and report vaccination rates as part of the COVID-19 vaccine mandate announced September 29. Under the mandate, all employees are required to have at least a first dose of vaccine by November 30, with a requirement to show proof of full vaccination 70 days after their first dose. Those who are partially vaccinated may be subjected to other health and safety measures, including testing. Those who do not have a first dose by November 30 will be placed on unpaid administrative leave. As of November 4, between 50 and 90 per cent of employees in key sectors have provided proof of vaccination. Of those who responded, most are fully vaccinated: - Nova Scotia Health Authority: 91 per cent - IWK Health Centre: 99 per cent - Long-term care: 93 per cent - Home care: 89 per cent - Education: 97 per cent - Emergency Health Services: 99 per cent \"I'm encouraged by the rates so far and I want to thank all of the employees who are vaccinated and doing their part to keep the vulnerable people they work with safe from COVID-19,\" said Premier Tim Houston. \"This mandate is serious, but these are serious times and we have to take our responsibility to protect others seriously. If you haven't been vaccinated yet, I encourage you to make the right choice.\" Data collection continues. Over the next couple of weeks, employers will be following up with employees who have not yet reported their status or their intention to be vaccinated. Employees who have not yet reported, or who have said they do not intend to be vaccinated, must complete a mandatory educational program.
