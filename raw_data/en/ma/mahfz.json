Rooted in French spa culture, Barbara's original space in East Hampton used a pharmacy of flowers and plants to create tinctures, balms, teas, and essential oils\u2014things that became integral for our best-selling formulas. It also employed time-tested skin and body-care rituals designed to reconnect all parts of the body and mind back to each other, and back to nature. Now, Naturopathica has spas in East Hampton, NY and in the Chelsea and TriBeCa neighborhoods of Manhattan. Featured Spa Treatments These popular healing rituals benefit the skin, body, and mind, and are designed to accelerate your wellness journey while grounding your whole self in the natural world.

She explained every step along the way and made my experience feel very special. The spa itself provides a calming retreat from the city.\" \u2014 Veronica N. \"I had an amazing experience. I'd 100% recommend this place!\" \u2014 Siany B. \" had a prenatal massage today with Marcus and he was amazing. He really listened to my requests (I'm really picky with massages and masseuses FYI!) The spa is relaxing, immaculate, and all staff members were helpful and wonderful to interact with.\" \u2014 K.M \"This is a five star spa experience that I thought you could only get at a fancy resort. The facilities are gorgeous, they offer you tea/water immediately upon entering, and you have access to private dressing rooms with everything you could need. If you're in NYC, I would highly recommend booking your treatments here.\" \u2014 Becca \"From the moment I stepped into the facility I was set at the ease, what a sanctuary! Karen, the esthetician I had for my facial, was lovely. Her energy was nurturing and calm, and her assessment of my skin was expert. Exactly what I would expect from a luxury spa.\" \u2014 C.A. \"Melissa found & massaged the areas that needed the most work. Very relaxing. Great service.\" \u2014 Joni F. \"Karen is the absolute best! She creates such a relaxing and comfortable environment\" \u2014 Amanda B. \"Colin at East Hampton was absolutely amazing. I needed a deep tissue massage to really work my tense muscles. Colin found and worked every muscle that was tight. It was definitely the best massage that I have ever had and can't wait to go back again\" \u2014 Courtney Become a member The best way to maximize your skin's potential is with regular treatments and consistent guidance from our licensed and highly trusted estheticians and massage therapists.
