In many cases, there is scientific evidence that the alleged treatments are not effective, and in some cases, may even be harmful. Unlike [accepted cancer treatments](/wiki/Management_of_cancer), treatments lacking in evidence of efficacy are generally ignored or avoided by the [medical community](/wiki/Medical_community) and are often [pseudoscientific](/wiki/Pseudoscientific).

[[29]](#cite_note-qw-moerman-29) [Superfood](/wiki/Superfood)- a [marketing](/wiki/Marketing)term applied to certain foods with supposed health-giving properties. Cancer Research UK note that superfoods are often promoted as having an ability to prevent or cure diseases, including cancer; they caution, \"a healthy, balanced and varied diet can help to reduce the risk of cancer but it is unlikely that any single food will make a major difference on its own.\" [[30]](#cite_note-30) Electromagnetic and energy-based[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_unproven_and_disproven_cancer_treatments&action=edit\u00a7ion=3)] [Bioresonance therapy](/wiki/Bioresonance_therapy)- diagnosis and therapy delivered by attaching an electrical device to the patient, on the basis that cancer cells emit certain electromagnetic oscillations.
