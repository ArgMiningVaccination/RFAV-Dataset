Alongside her work helping women with PCOS, Dr. Natalie specializes in assisting women with infertility and other hormone-related issues from a holistic perspective. Key Takeaways: What is PCOS? PCOS, which stands for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, is a hormonal disorder that affects women of reproductive age. Women with PCOS have imbalanced levels of hormones, such as higher levels of androgens and insulin, which can cause a range of symptoms, including irregular menstrual cycles, fatigue, acne, excessive hair growth, weight gain, and even difficulty getting pregnant. Dr. Natalie states that one in seven women are now dealing with PCOS. Challenges of PCOS diagnosis and management When it comes to a PCOS diagnosis, thorough investigations are not being done. There's also a misconception that you need a cyst on your ovaries to qualify for a PCOS diagnosis, which is not true. Many women are being misdiagnosed or mislabeled due to either the presence or lack of polycystic ovarian morphology. If a woman has two of the three Rotterdam criteria, she has PCOS. However, Dr. Natalie believes there is a need for more expansive criteria for diagnosing PCOS than the current Rotterdam criteria. She also mentions that PCOS is a lifelong condition that can be managed well with the proper practices and strategies. Exploring the Rotterdam criteria In order to qualify someone for a PCOS diagnosis, specialists look for two of the three Rotterdam criteria, which are the presence of polycystic ovarian morphology or a cyst, ovulatory dysfunction, and the presence of excess androgens based on labs. However, Dr. Natalie also looks for other signs like inflammation, insulin resistance, chronic stressors, chronic adrenal dysfunction, and more. What causes PCOS? The root causes or drivers of PCOS include inflammation, insulin resistance, environmental toxins, stressors, childhood trauma, sexual trauma, and toxic maternal relationships. Night shift workers, gymnasts, and high-level athletes often have adrenal stress patterns which can lead to hormone dysregulation and PCOS. Additionally, genetics can play a role in PCOS development as well as metabolic issues such as pancreatic beta cell dysfunction and insulin resistance. Dr. Natalie's bits of advice Adopt lifestyle strategies such as getting exposure to natural light within twenty minutes of waking, eating breakfast outside, taking a ten-minute walk after meals, establishing a consistent sleep pattern, eating an anti-inflammatory diet, managing stress through meditation and vagus nerve exercises, using essential oils for self-care, and re-evaluating close relationships. You can also use supplements, herbal therapies, bioidenticals, and natural antimicrobials.
