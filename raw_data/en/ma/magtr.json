Yellow Fever Vaccination Yellow Fever Vaccination An effective vaccine also exists to prevent yellow fever. Yellow fever vaccine is a live-virus vaccine, and a single dose protects against disease for 10 years or more. If a person is at continued risk of infection, a booster dose is recommended every 10 years. Yellow fever vaccine is recommended for persons aged 9 months or older who are traveling to (or living in) areas at risk for yellow fever virus transmission in South America and Africa. Some countries require individuals entering their borders to display a valid International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis, documenting their receipt of the yellow fever vaccine. Yellow fever vaccination requirements and recommendations for specific countries are available at: [http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2012/chapter-3-infectious-diseases-related-to-travel/yellow-fever.htm](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2012/chapter-3-infectious-diseases-related-to-travel/yellow-fever.htm) Serious adverse events can occur following yellow fever vaccination. Therefore, persons should only be vaccinated if they are at risk of exposure to yellow fever virus or require proof of vaccination for country entry. Individuals considering yellow fever vaccination should discuss their underlying health conditions with their health care provider. A medical waiver can be given for persons with a precaution or contraindication to vaccination. Among those persons who should not receive yellow fever vaccine (contraindications) are individuals who have: - A compromised immune system - A history of (or current) thymus disease - Egg, chicken, or gelatin allergy - Are younger than 6 months In addition, the vaccine should be given with caution and only after carefully considering the potential risks and benefits (precautions) for those who are: - Pregnant - Lactating - Age 60 years or more - Age between 6 - 8 months This vaccine is administered only at designated vaccination centers.
