It includes heterogeneity in productivity, age and the ability to work at home. Worker and rm behavior changes in the presence of the virus, which itself has equilibrium consequences for the infection rate. The model is calibrated to the UK and counterfactual lockdown measures are evaluated. We nd a di erent response in both the evolution of the virus and the labor market with di erent degrees of severity of lockdown. We use these insights to make a labor market policy prescription to be used in conjunction with lockdown measures. Finally we nd that, while the pandemic and ensuing policies impact the majority of the population negatively, consistent with recent studies, the costs are not borne equally. While the old face the highest health risks, it is the young low wage workers who su er the most income and employment risk. JEL Classi cation: I1, I3, J1, J6 1 Introduction The COVID-19 outbreak has posed signi cant global challenges to public health and the economy. Since the rst cases of infection reported in China in January 2020, there have been more than 26 million cases reported worldwide and at the time of writing, it has killed more than 800 thousand people. In the United Kingdom (UK), this virus has caused the death of more than 40 thousand people, with a daily peak of 1100 deaths su ered on April 21, 2020 (Figure 1). Economically, the FTSE 100 fell by 25% in the rst three months of 2020, the largest quarterly fall in over three decades. Workers in the economy were particularly hard hit, with the Department of Work and Pensions processing more than ve times the typical level of bene t claimants (see the second panel of Figure 1). Public lockdown policy, \u0003Contacts: Bradley, jake.bradley@nottingham.ac.uk, Ruggieri, alessandro.ruggieri@nottingham.ac.uk, Spencer, adam.spencer@nottingham.ac.uk. The usual disclaimers apply. 1aimed at reducing the spread of the infection and ultimately saving lives, further exacerbates the economic costs associated with the pandemic. This paper merges two workhorse models from epidemiology and economics to garner a deeper understanding of the interaction between the health and economic costs associated with the pandemic. Using the UK as a case study, we examine the implications of di erent lockdown policies on fatalities and the economy. Finally, we study active labor market policy that can run in conjunction with a lockdown that we argue will mitigate the economic costs. Figure 1: The UK's Health and Economic Cost of Covid-19 Daily Deaths Universal Credit Claims Source: UK NHS (See https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/) Source: UK Department for Work and Pensions We analyse lockdown policies of di ering durations. Unsurprisingly, we nd that longer lockdowns will save more lives, while causing greater harm to the economy. However, the disease and labor market dynamics can contrast quite markedly across these di ering dura- tions. In terms of the labor market, when locked down, a worker- rm pair's production falls. A longer lockdown makes it more expensive for rms to hold onto their employees. Conse- quently, we see a larger number of layo s at the start of lockdown and a greater adjustment in worker- rm allocation throughout its duration. This results in lower output losses per period during the lockdown, as the market has adjusted to the new normal . However, it also comes with a much slower recovery. In contrast, if the lockdown is short, rms hoard their workers in anticipation of the policy's conclusion, thereby taking short term losses during the economic lockdown. This motivates our policy prescription | one that allows reallocation of workers during the lockdown to mitigate economic losses throughout its duration. This approach preserves the match capital before lockdown, while simultaneously allowing for a faster recovery post lockdown. The speci c policy we discuss is a furlough worker scheme, in which furloughed workers can look for new employment without foregoing the government paid furloughed wage. Our model incorporates the SIR model of infectious diseases (Kermack and McKendrick 2(1927)) with the Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides (DMP) model of the labor market (Diamond (1982), Pissarides (1985) and Mortensen and Pissarides (1994)). Fundamentally it is through these two classes of models that we can simultaneously examine the tradeo in the health and economic cost of the pandemic. In order to understand the particularities of the Covid- 19 pandemic we add three sources of heterogeneity not present in the prototypical versions of either class of model. Looking at any country the most striking feature regarding the composition of fatalities is age | Covid-19 is far more dangerous for the old than the young. Consequently, we incorporate ageing into the model. From the epidemiology perspective that means higher mortality rates for the old. Using data on fatality rates we calibrate a mortality rate for the over 65s to be twenty times larger than for those under 65s. From a labor market perspective that means retirement. A second feature of the Covid pandemic that is becoming clear is economic losses are not borne equally by workers. Those in low wage jobs face far greater income and employment risk than those in high wage jobs, (for the UK context see Adams-Prassl et al. (2020)). To this end we introduce wage dispersion into the model through an exogenous productivity distribution. Finally, to link the two classes of models directly we introduce a production function that depends on, in addition to the inherent productivity of the match, the fraction of tasks that can be performed at home. While spending more time working away from home can increase total production, in a pandemic it will also increase a worker's exposure to the virus. Sus- ceptible workers who are very productive from home, thereby foregoing little production and little of their wage, will choose to do so when the infection rate is high, slowing the spread of the pandemic. However, not all workers are a orded this luxury and as will be shown these lesslucky workers tend to be in low paid work. Further, while workers, even in the absence of lockdown policy, will work more at home, they will do so out of self interest. When making this decision however, they do not internalize the negative externality of becoming infected on increasing the infection rate for society as a whole. This market failure addition- ally motivates the need for government intervention in locking down a section of the economy. Related literature. Before the Covid-19 pandemic there existed a small theoretical literature which merged economic behavior to epidemiology models. In a standard model of disease transmission the ` basic reproduction rate ' is a constant | that is the average number of people one will infect given that the rest of the population is susceptible. In some sense the theoretical economic literature attempts to endogenize this rate. For a variety of mechanisms and diseases see, Kremer (1996), Quercioli and Smith (2006), Toxvaerd (2019, 2020) and Galeotti and Rogers (2013). In the context of our model the reproduction number depends on the decisions of how much to work away from home made by the susceptible employed. This paper is quantitative in nature and incorporates heterogeneity in many dimensions. Again, there is a small literature before this pandemic on calibrating and simulating a quantitative model of economic agents in an epidemiological framework. For the HIV virus see Greenwood et al. (2017, 2019) and Chan et al. (2016) and for Bird- u (and now Covid) Keppo et al. 3(2020). Since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic there is a large and expanding number of papers building on the work of the aforementioned authors. That said, to our knowledge there is only Kapick\u0014 a and Rupert (2020) that also explore how a frictional labor market interacts with a pandemic. However, the focus and exposition of their paper is quite di erent. A worker's health status segments the labor market and is the only source of heterogeneity. Interestingly there are papers that have leaned on the two building blocks of our model to understand disease spread, see Farboodi et al. (2020) and Garibaldi et al. (2020). But neither paper explicitly models the labor market. More broadly, there are a number of quantitative models that evaluate the economic and health tradeo s of the pandemic and policies. Eichenbaum et al. (2020) merge the SIR model with a neo-classical representative agent model. We argue that heterogeneity is an important factor in the pandemic and our model allows for health and economic costs to vary by age, wage and occupation. Kaplan et al. (2020) account for dispersion in occupation and assets and Brotherhood et al. (2020), Favero et al. (2020) and Glover et al. (2020) use a multi-risk SIR model to account for di erential mortality by age. The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. In section 2 we setup our baseline model of the labor market and the pandemic. In section 3 we explain the role of lockdown policy. The model is calibrated to data and policy simulations are run in section 4. Section 5 concludes. 2 The baseline model The Environment Time is continuous and initially the economy is populated by a unit mass of individuals who are risk neutral, either young or old and discount the future at a constant rate r. Young individuals are part of the labor force and age stochastically at a Poisson rate \u0011. A constant exogenous ow of young individuals are born into unemployment. Given their age and health status workers are ex ante homogeneous and if young are ex post heterogeneous in their employment status. They can be either employed and vary in their wage wor unem- ployed, sustaining themselves with an exogenous ow bu. We do not distinguish between the unemployed and the inactive and will therefore use the terms not employed and unemployed interchangeably. Old individuals are retired, they sustain themselves with exogenous ow boand die stochastically of natural causes at Poisson rate .1In addition to age and and labor force status individuals are characterized by a health state, h, which can be either susceptible h=s, infectedh=i, or recovered h=r. 1To x the initial population to one, the parameter is set accordingly as :=\u0011 \u0011+ . 4Production A match between a worker and a rm is characterized by two indices. A productivity index xand a technology index , wherex; 2[0;1]. The variable describes the e\u000eciency of home working relative to working away from home. The function ~h( ) describes the measure of tasks associated with a job that can be performed at home, where ~h: [0;1]![0;1] and ~h0( )>0. The function g(x) describes the total potential output of the worker- rm pair, whereg0(x)>0 andg: [0;1]!R+. We assume an \u000fcost in performing a task away from home. So any task that can be completed at home will be. Total output of a match is given byp( ;x;m ) wherem2f0;1g, taking the value 0 if a worker exclusively works from home and one if they ever work away from home. p( ;x; 0) =g(x)~h( ) andp( ;x; 1) g(\u0001) and ~h(\u0001) will be parameterized later but notice that a worker leaving their house for work will produce an amount entirely dependent on xand output is always at least as high by working outside of the household, p( ;x; 1)\u0015p( ;x; 0). The indices andxare drawn from a joint distribution f( ;x) at the time of worker- rm meeting and are xed for the duration of the match. We allow for dependence between andxin the distribution fand without loss of generality we assume that both have have uniform marginal distributions on [0 ;1]. Health status Individuals transit between three health states h: susceptible ( s), infected ( i) and recovered (r) according to the standard SIR epidemiology model, with one modi cation. Susceptible agents who do not leave the home to work contract the disease with a Poisson rate \u00150`it where\u00150>0 is an exogenous xed parameter and `itis the share of the population who are infected at time t. We depart from the standard model by assuming that if a susceptible individual goes to work outside of their home they increase their rate of infection and become infected at an increased Poisson intensity ( \u00150+\u00151)`it, where\u00151>0.2This introduces a clear trade-o for the worker, by working away from home their production will increase, and in turn so will their wage. However, they do so by increasing the likelihood of contracting the disease. Further, while a worker's decision will internalize the individual cost of working away from home it does not internalize the cost to society. By becoming infected the share of the infected population `itwill increase and so will the rate of infection at which susceptible workers of any age and employment status catch the disease. 2In the model workers will not run into infected colleagues at their place of work. We think of this in- creased risk through travelling to work and increased exposure to other members of society while at their place of work. 5Once infected, individuals will either recover from the disease at Poisson rate \u001aand transition to the recovered state or they pass away from the disease at rate a(`it). We allow the mortality of the disease to vary with both an individual's age and the share of the population infected. We allow variation in age as data on recorded mortality rates di er starkly across age groups and we allow the death rate to vary with the infection rate as a proxy for capacity constraints in intensive care units.Further, in our model being infected means a worker is not able to either look form employment if out of work or produce output if in work. Finally, being recovered is an absorbing health status.3 The labor market The labor market is subject to search frictions. Unemployed and healthy workers can cost- lessly search for a job. Firms post vacancies at ow cost \u0014to attract potential applicants. The total measure of vacancies posted is determined by a free entry condition. On the worker's side, only the young, non-employed and non-infected can search for work. (Active) searching workers, at:=ust+urt, whereust(urt) is the measure of susceptible (recovered) unemployed workers at time t, and un lled vacancy, vt, meet at a rate determined by a con- stant returns to scale meeting function m(at;vt). This implies a job nding rate for workers of tand a worker nding rate of f tfor rms, t=m(at;vt) atand f t=m(at;vt) vt= at vt(2) After meeting, the worker and rm draw andxfrom the joint distribution f. There is no private information and the values of ,xand the health status of the worker will determine whether the meeting results in a match. Matches exogenously separate at a constant exogenous Poisson rate \u000e. Contracting space The joint surplus generated from a match is shared between worker and rm according to a Nash bargaining protocol. In a rst step a contract is written to account for time devoted to working from home by maximizing joint surplus. Let m2f0;1gbe an indicator to denote if work is only performed at home, m= 0, or away from home, m= 1, respectively. Wage is determined to split the surplus according to the standard Nash sharing rule, where worker receives a share 2(0;1) of the total surplus and the rm (1 \u0000 ). 3At the time of writing, there is little evidence regarding antibody immunity or lack thereof. We take the stance that those who have recovered from the virus can not contract it again. Note, the model could easily accommodate a Poisson rate from recovery back to susceptibility and depending on the epidemiolog- ical evidence we may change this in future work. 6We denote the value functions of matched workers and Wht(w; ;x;m ) and Jht(w; ;x;m ), whereWis the being employed and Jthe value of a lled vacancy for the rm in a match with a worker of health status h2fs;i;rg, with job characteristics ( ;x) under a contract ( w;m) at timet. LetUhtbe the value of being unemployed for a worker with health status h2fs;i;rgandVtbe the value of an open vacancy. We assume that the joint surplus of a match can be written independent of the wage and is given by equation (3), (which is when a worker and rm meet they decide jointly on the working arrangements and choosemaccording to arg max m2f0;1gfSht( ;x;m )g:=Sht( ;x): Since there is an \u000fcost associated with working outside the home we break the indi erence by assuming if the surpluses are equal a worker works exclusively from home. We can de ne the set of feasible matches as the values of h, andxthat generate non-negative joint surplus,Sht( ;x)\u00150. Finally, after negotiating a wage and work environment both parties must comply to their contractual agreement for a stochastic length of time. We assume that if there is a change in the health status of the worker the pair can costlessly change the agreement of working at or away from home, but not their wage agreement. Otherwise they can only adjust the hours of work or wages when they re-negotiate, which happens at an exogenous Poisson rate \u0017. After the re-negotiation shock they may also decide to separate if the joint surplus is negative. This rigidity models in a reduced form way the inability of UK rms to layo workers immediately after changes in policy or worker's changing health status. Vacancy creation Vacant jobs make contact with unemployed workers at a rate f t. We assume free entry such that potential rms continue to post vacancies until the presented discounted expected value of doing so is zero. The value of posting a vacancy is given by rVt=\u0000\u0014+ f ow cost incurred when posting a vacancy. Thus the equilibrium aggregate number of vacancies are determined by setting the left hand side of equation (4) to zero. Equilibrium and solving the model The model structure allows all decisions, whether a worker- rm match is feasible and if so whether the worker should work in or away from the household, to be a function of the joint surplus of a match. This property is shown by specifying and solving the value functions in Appendix A.1. In addition one must compute the allocation of workers across demographic, health and economic status. These follow the dynamics in Appendix A.2. We assume the economy starts from a unique steady-state in which the whole population is susceptible and deviate with a small initial seed mass in which the probability of infection is constant across employment state. The nal equilibrium object to pin down is the number of vacancies posted by rms, which given worker allocations and surpluses uniquely solves equation (4). Details of how these objects are computationally solved are provided in Appendix A.3. 3 Economy under lockdown Lockdown is modeled as an exogenous and random share \u00192[0;1] of the economy prevented from operating away from home (e.g. an o\u000ece). Workers in these locked jobs are mandated to only work at home. Thus if the policy binds, a match of production index will see their production fall by a share (1 \u0000~h( )). New jobs can either be in the ` locked ', (with probability \u0019), or ` unlocked ' sector, (with probability (1 \u0000\u0019)). This draw is made at the time of worker- rm meeting and is assumed orthogonal to andx.4 We model lockdown as slowing the rate of transmission through two mechanisms. Firstly, fewer people work away from their home. This reduces the number of people who contract the disease at their place of work. Those working at home have a Poisson rate of becoming infected which is \u00151`itless than those working away from home. The second mechanism is through social distancing. While not explicitly modeled, a lockdown on bars and restaurants for example will reduce the number of social interactions in the economy. The parameter \u00150 governs the latent transmission rate irrespective of working decisions. Since lockdown will also reduce this we assume this parameter in lockdown is given by \u0015L 0:= (1\u0000\u0010\u0019)\u00150: \u00102[0;1] governs the potential e ectiveness of the lockdown. For example, if the gov- ernment took the extreme action of shutting down the entire economy the Poisson rate of 4In future work, when survey data can be easily analyzed it would be interesting to assume two condi- tional distributions for f(\u0001). This would allow one to evaluate economic costs from targeted lockdowns. 8infection for a susceptible individual would be given by (1 \u0000\u0010)\u00150`it. The nal amendment to the model is that lockdown is not permanent. While lockdown arrives as an unanticipated shock, agents assume it ends at an exogenous Poisson rate \u0003 after which the economy re- turns to the status quo. Modeling lockdown policy introduces an additional state variable for a worker- rm pair. That is, whether or not the job is ` locked ' orunlocked ', otherwise the model retains the same structure. In order to avoid repetition, we relegate the exposition and solution of the model to a complementary online appendix. 4 Quantitative results The goal of this section is to examine the likely e ects of lockdown policy on the safety of workers and the performance of the economy as a whole. Rather than being explicit about a social welfare function we simply demonstrate the tradeo between the likely number of fatalities from the epidemic and the stress to the economy caused by lockdown policy. It is necessary to begin with two home truths. Firstly, a laissez faire approach, in the presence of the pandemic, will cause an economic downturn. That is to say, because of endogenous responses in the model, even in the absence of economic policy there will be economic losses and they are likely to be large. In particular, we nd cumulative output losses to be around 2.4% of the pre-pandemic level under the laissez faire approach over 5-year horizon. Secondly, in the absence of a vaccine, the infection exists inde nitely, irrespective of how draconian a lockdown policy may be. In fact because we model new entrants into the labor market as susceptible, in the long run the pandemic will repeat itself in dampening cycles in perpetuity. Since these cycles materialize at approximately a twenty year frequency, we abstract from these in our discussion of policy and assume by the time of the next cycle a vaccine has been developed. Consequently, all discussion will relate to the ongoing wave of the pandemic. As a preview of our results we summarize these points and other ndings in the list below. 1. Lockdown will not rid us of the virus. For that a vaccine needs to be found. 2. Lockdown is not the only source of economic stress. The economy will su er from a laissez-faire approach. 3. Lockdown policy can mitigate the loss of life in this wave but to be e ective in saving lives it will have to be implemented for a considerable length of time. 4. The economic costs of lockdown are not borne uniformly across the cross-section of workers: those at the lower-end of the wage distribution are a ected disproportionally more. 95. Given the response of the labor market to di erent lockdown measures and the hetero- geneity in economic costs | we make a policy prescription to be run in conjunction with lockdown to mitigate economic losses. 4.1 Parameterization To proceed, we begin by specifying functional forms for the matching function m(at;vt), the functions entering production, g(x) and ~h( ), the distribution of job's characteristics, f(x; ), and the death rates for young and old individuals, o(`it) and y(`it). We use a standard Cobb-Douglas function to model contacts between vacancies vand searchers a. m(at;vt) =a1\u0000\u0018 tv\u0018 t; where\u00182(0;1) denotes the elasticity of contact with respect to the stock of open vacancies. This matching function implies f t=m(at;vt) vt=\u0012\u0018\u00001 t and t=m(at;vt) at=\u0012t f t: The variable \u0012tdenotes the labor market tightness, de ned as \u0012t:=vt=at. We specify the total potential output of a worker- rm pair of index xas the inverse of a log-normal distribution with underlying mean \u0016xand exp\u0000 \u0016x+\u001bx\b\u00001(x)\u0001 where \b\u00001(\u0001) denotes the inverse cumulative distribution function of a standard normal distribution. To describe the proportion of job tasks that can be performed at home, we assume ~h( ) to be an inverted Beta distribution, ~h( ) = 1\u00001( + 1)\u0000 1\u0000 2 B( 1; 2) where 1; 2\u00151 are the parameters of the beta distribution and Bdenotes the Beta function. To model correlation between job productivity xand home e\u000eciency , we choose the function f( ;x) be a Gaussian copula with correlation parameter \u001a ;x. Finally, we assume the death rates for old and young individuals are independent of the stock of infected, and we set them equal to o(`it) = oand y(`it) = y: 104.2 Calibration The model is calibrated at a weekly frequency for the pre-epidemic period and simulations are run at a daily frequency. The rst three blocks of Table 1 report parameters values for demographic, labor market and technology and the moments used to calibrate them. The interest rate ris set to have an annual return of 5%. Workers spend on average 40 years in the labor market, and 15 years in retirement. These values pin down ageing rate \u0011and death rate . We set the re-negotiation rate to match two weeks of advance notice and x \u0017= 0:5.5 We set the income ow for unemployed workers to 65% of the average wage as reported for the UK in 2019 by the OECD. The income ow for retired workers to 75% of the average wage, to match the ratio between equivalized disposable income of retired and non-retired HH (ONS). The bargaining power, , is calibrated to match a value for labor share equal to 54:63% (UK national accounts 2016Q3). The matching elasticity, \u0018is calibrated to match the estimated value of 0 :35 in Turrell et al. (2018). The exogenous job destruction rate, \u000e, is calibrated to match a monthly separation rate of 4% reported in Postel-Vinay and Sepahsalari (2019).6Finally, we calibrate the cost of posting of vacancy, \u0014, to match the employment rate in the last quarter of 2019 (ONS). We are left with ve parameters, governing productivity and home-working e\u000eciency. We calibrate the parameters in the output technology \u0016xand\u001bxto match an average weekly earnings of 545 GBP (ONS Weekly Earnings Survey, February 2020) and an average stock of vacancy per population in the last quarter of 2019 of 1 :19% (ONS - Vacancy Survey).7 Conditional on all other parameters, including the meeting function, the number of matches from a stock of vacancies is governed by the proportion of meetings that result in matches. This proportion is driven by the degree of dispersion in the job sampling distribution.8While we choose the parameters in the inverted beta distribution, 1and 2to match average and standard deviation of home-working hours before the pandemic. These data are taken from January-December 2019 from the Annual Population Survey (APS) and presented in Appendix A.4, panel a. Finally, we calibrate the copula parameter, \u001a ;x, to match the correlation between number of hours and average log weekly earnings (see Appendix A.4, panel b) Turning to the parameters of the SIR model, we follow Ferguson et al. (2020) and calibrate 5The statutory redundancy notice period in the UK is in practice a function of the length of time one has been in their job. Those employed for under a month can be laid o without notice. For those em- ployed between one month and two years, one week notice is required. Then for each additional year a further weeks notice is required, capped at twelve weeks. 6Recall, we do not distinguish between the young and inactive and unemployed so take the sum of the separation rates to unemployment and inactivity at the end of their sample. 7Expressions for wages in our model are deferred to the online appendix. 8To see this, imagine there were no dispersion in productivity. All worker- rm meetings will result in matches as the worker or rm have no incentive to wait and nd a better match. 11Table 1: Calibrated Parameters Parameters Description Value Source/Target Demographics r Discount rate 0.00098641 Annual return: 5% annual \u0011 Ageing labor market: Death rate 0.00128210 population=1 Labor market \u0017 Re-negotiation rate 0.5 Two weeks advance notice br Retirement income ow 406.02 Equivalized disposable income retired/non-retired HH=75% (ONS) ow 354.25 Average replacement rate=65% (OECD) \u0018 Matching elasticity 0.35 Turrell et al.

From the context of the model this is the reproduction rate when the entire population is susceptible without any endogenous changes to the working environment. From the perspective of the data, this comes from the early estimates in Wuhan, again when the population was close to fully susceptible.9To disentangle the value of \u00150from\u00151we calibrate 9Estimates from Riou and Althaus (2020) and Li et al. (2020) put the number somewhere between 2.0 and 2.6 12\u00151to match the number of individuals who contracted the virus at their place of work. Riccardo et al. (2020) estimate this number in Italy as being at 2.4%. We calibrate death rates of young and old, yand oto match case fatality ratio in their age categories Verity et al. (2020)., Finally, we x the average recovery period to 10 days following Ferguson et al. (2020). 4.3 Counterfactual experiments We keep the severity of a lockdown ( \u0019) xed and vary the duration (\u0003). The speci cs of the policy simulation are represented in the nal block of Table 1. We begin with very few infected people and assume all employment states are equally likely to be infected at time zero. The economy is simulated and we assume lockdown arrives as an unanticipated shock 24 days after the rst registered death, to mirror the experience of the UK. Since there are a continuum of workers in the model we interpret the rst death as the number of deaths exceeding one divided by the UK's population. The proportion of the economy locked down \u0019and the impact this has on social distancing \u0010are calibrated from Google user's location data. The proportion of jobs locked down is taken from the change in visits to the user's workplace which dropped by 63% post lockdown. The impact this had on social distancing is the taken from the change in visits to a ` social ' sector that was largely locked down, re- tail and recreation. This includes retail outlets, shopping centers, museums etc. but omits grocery stores and other more essential services that were not placed on lockdown. Health costs. We begin by looking at the health costs of the pandemic associated with a six and twelve month lockdown period. The lockdown policy is shown in the rst panel of Figure 2 and the associated health costs in the second row. Both lockdown poli- cies are able to suppress the pandemic to some extent and will result in fewer total deaths than doing nothing shown in black. The six month lockdown suppresses the virus during lockdown but is lifted before the peak and results in many more lives lost following the lifting of restrictions. By contrast the twelve month lockdown appears to break the back of the pandemic. However, because of the tightness of the restrictions there are still many susceptible individuals in the economy, below the level needed for herd immunity. Hence after the lifting of the restrictions a second wave of the virus sweeps through the population.10 Economic cost. As well as variation in the health costs associated with di erent lock- down policies there are also large variations in the economic consequences. As has been 10A less strict lockdown policy as measured by \u0019could actually lower the fatality rates in this illustra- tive example. For the case of the six month policy, the peak would come sooner and could potentially be dampened with more early exposure. Similarly, if calibrated perfectly, the twelve month lockdown with a lesser\u0019would have a larger initial wave but could avoid the second wave by reducing the number of sus- ceptible people still in the economy. 13Figure 2: Dynamics of the Pandemic and Economy Lockdown Policy Total Employment Aggregate Daily Output Daily Fatality Rate Stock of Infected Stock of Susceptible Gross Fires Gross Hires Proportion in Lockdown discussed no policy intervention is not costless from an economic point of view. Work days are lost because of illness and the increased exposure to health risks reduce the value of jobs and thus the level of vacancy posting reduces. Lockdown policy will inevitably confound these losses. Primarily because it directly reduces potential output, forcing a share of jobs in the economy to limit production to inside the worker's home. Clearly, the longer the economy is restricted, the larger these losses are going to be. However the losses are also intrinsically linked to the workings of the labor market. This can be seen in the rst row of Figure 2. The shorter lockdown has a much smaller initial fall in employment. Since rms know the lockdown is relatively short, rms opt to hoard their workforce. Even in the face 14of a considerable drop in production, rms prefer this choice over incurring hiring costs in the future; they keep their workers on the payroll and take the short term losses. This labor hoarding has advantages and disadvantages to the economy. On the positive side, it makes for a speedier recovery when lockdown ends. As can be seen in the gure, daily output returns to pre-crisis levels quicker for the shorter lockdown. Since many more matches are held together through the pandemic they are well suited to the normal environment post lockdown. However, during the lockdown production is likely to stay low as the labor market does not readjust to the changing environment. Labor adjustment. To better understand the di erent labor market responses to the di erent durations of lockdown, the nal row of Figure 2 plots the response in gross hiring and ring following implementation. As discussed, the more severe lockdown results in many more layo s as hoarding labor for prosperous times to come becomes far more expensive. At the same time there is also a large initial fall in hiring as many matches are locked and will not hire unless they are extremely productive or e\u000ecient in working from home. After an initial fall, the level of hiring rises steadily under both regimes. This is in part due to a larger pool of unemployed following the large rise in layo s and in part because of workers' falling outside option | the deteriorating state of the economy makes them less discerning in which matches to accept. In fact, because of the enormous misallocation shock to the economy, hiring levels under both policy options eventually exceed the level of hiring pre-lockdown. The nal panel shows the direction that reallocation takes. Initially the share of workers subject to lockdown is the same as the proportion of the economy under lockdown. How- ever, following layo s based predominantly in locked sectors, in addition to new hires going into matches that are unlocked, there is a decline in the fraction of the economy locked down. Heterogeneous e ects. Figure 3 depicts the e ect of the short and long duration lock- down policies, in addition to a laissez-faire approach, on measures of income and employment risk for a simulated panel of workers. To study the e ect on income, we look at total income of a worker in the rst quarter of lockdown relative to the last prior to its commencement. Our measure of employment risk is the probability that a worker, who is employed at the time of lockdown's commencement, remains employed in the next quarter. Quarterly income is computed as the integral of all earnings over a quarter, both labor, and if unemployed, home production. For a susceptible worker, who form almost the entire population at the implementation of lockdown, see Figure 2, the surplus of a match will fall. This is true irrespective of lockdown status as there is an increased probability of match disruption, through the worker getting infected. For those in locked professions this fall in surplus and hence wages is confounded further as output will fall considerably.11In unlocked 11For a worker in a match ( ;x) who if unlocked would leave the home for work will see a proportional fall in output of (1 \u0000~h( )). On average that corresponds to an almost 90% fall in output. 15Figure 3: Heterogeneous e ects of policies on the worker cross-section By Wage Decile Income risk (mean) Income risk (80th- 20thpercentile) Employment risk By Working Environment Income risk (mean) Income risk (80th- 20thpercentile) Employment risk Notes: 20,000 workers are simulated over two quarters either side of the implementation of lockdown. Included in the sample presented in the gure are those who were employed at lockdown and were active in the labor market (neither retired nor newly entered) for the 90 days prior and subsequent to lockdown. Leaving a reduced sample of 10,864. professions the change in wage is ambiguous and will vary from match to match. On the one hand, the surplus falls through increased disruption. On the other, to compensate the increased risk exposure the worker will take a larger share of the output. In addition to wage changes on the job the other source of income risk are endogenous separations. If the surplus falls below zero a worker and rm match separates. The large increase in the probability of being laid o (top right panel, Figure 3) suggests that this second mechanism is the primary driver in the increase in overall income risk. Comparing mean income falls with employment probabilities by either wage or work en- vironment show the same workers are losing out in both. Inspection of Figure 3 reveals the aggregate implications of these di erent mechanisms for workers across the distribution of wages and working environment. The rst column shows the average change in quarterly income. While lockdown policy is ubiquitous in its impact those that spend little time work- ing at home or are low wage workers su er a lot more. As discussed, looking at the third 16Figure 4: Policy Possibility Frontier Two years post lockdown Five years post lockdown column it is easy to see why. These are the workers who are being laid o and consequently su er large losses in income. For su\u000eciently well paid workers there is no increase in em- ployment risk with lockdown. This cuto increases as the severity of the lockdown increases. Finally, in addition to increased employment risk and lower income, the risk (measured as the dispersion of income changes) also increases. This is felt hardest by those with the least ability to insure against it, the lowest paid. Evaluating policy options. Rather than being explicit about a social welfare function we follow Kaplan et al. (2020) and de ne a policy possibility frontier. This function is useful for policymakers as it plots the feasible outcomes, lives saved and economic consequences of di erent lockdown policies. Taking two and ve year horizons, Figure 4 plots di ering durations of lockdown on this health-economic space. One can see the clear tradeo between the two metrics; a judgment on how draconian a policy a government wishes to implement will depend on its speci c welfare function. Given insights from the quantitative model we instead discuss how to give policymakers a better menu of outcomes. That is: what labor market policy used in conjunction with lockdown could shift the frontier in a north easterly direction. In particular we consider the `Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme' implemented by the UK government. The key ndings that drive our policy discussion are the following. First, during a short lockdown, there is a large degree of labor hoarding, which speeds-up the economic recovery when the restrictions are lifted. Second, this labor hoarding suppresses economic activity during the lockdown. Third, young workers on a low wage are those harmed the most economically from the lockdown. These three results speak directly to the e\u000ecacy of the furlough aspect of the UK Government's Scheme. The furlough scheme implemented paid workers 80% of their monthly salaries, capped 17at 2,500 pounds per month. The policy eventually allowed workers to seek alternative em- ployment while furloughed and expanded to the self-employed as well. The impulse response functions in Figure 2 illustrate why this policy would mitigate economic costs associated with a lockdown. Allowing worker- rm pairs to temporarily separate without breaking their employment ties will foster a quick recovery following the end of lockdown, as with the short lockdown exercise. Crucially however allowing workers to seek alternative employment in the short run allows for greater production during lockdown | either in the unlocked sectors, which are likely vital, or in locked sectors that do not rely so much on working outside of the home. A similar conceptual point is made by Fujita et al. (2020) and Costa-Dias et al. (2020) whom lobbied the government to switch track and allow furloughed workers to seek other alternative temporary employment. Finally, a large component of the negative income risk brought on by the pandemic was employment risk and this is particularly felt by low wage workers. By taking the wage burden away from the rm, the government can insure against this risk. If policymaker also cared about inequality this would further improve outcomes. This mechanism is discussed by Blundell et al. (2020). In this paper we regard our policy prescription as a proof of concept. Future quantitative work to get a handle on just how useful such a policy could be extremely fruitful. To do this one would have to explicitly model a labor search model with job memory with an epidemiology model.12 5 Conclusion This paper combines two workhorse models from labor economics and epidemiology to create a choice theoretic model of disease transmission and a frictional labor market. Worker- rm decisions about whether to work from home and rm's vacancy decisions are consequential for the state of the economy and crucial for the infection rate. Understanding the co-movement of the pandemic and labor market is crucial for policymakers especially when deciding on lockdown policies. We show that the response of both di er starkly given the length of the lockdown imposed. Finally, we use insights garnered from the quantitative model to support the UK government's `Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme'.

We present the value functions in the same order the model is solved. Starting with terminal conditions and working backwards. Retired workers We begin with a retired individual who has recovered from the illness. The index tencap- sulates all potential aggregate state variables that vary with time. The discounted value is the sum of the ow value worker's get after retiring boand the option value of death, which occurs at Poisson rate . rRrt=bo+ (0\u0000Rrt) +_Rrt It can be seen that this value function is independent of time and can be rewritten dropping the time subscript as Rr=bo r+ : Retired agents who are currently infected have an increased death probability of o(`it) which varies with time through the evolution of the proportion of sick people. Additionally, they can recover from their illness at a rate \u001ao. retired agents who are susceptible again die at the reduced rate but they can also become infected which again depends on the proportion of the population with the infection at timet. rRst=bo+ (0\u0000Rst) +\u0015o`it(Rit\u0000Rst) +_Rst (r+ +\u0015o`it)Rst=bo+\u0015o`itRit+_Rst 22Recovered young individuals The value of being unemployed for a recovered individual is the sum of four terms. (i) The ow bene t buthey get from being out of work. This encapsulates both pecuniary and non-pecuniary bene ts including for example the value of leisure time. (ii) The option value of nding a job, from which if the surplus is positive they will get a fraction of. O ers arrive at an endogenous rate tto be determined later. (iii) The option value associated with retirement which occurs at exogenous rate \u0011. (iv) The continuation value from dynamic changes to the o er arrival rate and infection rate. These four terms are represented in the Bellman equation below. rUrt=bu+ +_Urt The employed in a job of match ( ;x) for a recovered individual in a contract (w;m) is given below. Where w2Ris the contractually agreed wage and m2f0;1g, taking the value one if the worker leaves their abode to work and zero lled vacancy. The value of an employer in a match ( ;x) with a recovered individual and contract ow value the rm receives is the production of the match, which will depends on whether the worker leaves their home ( m= 1) or not ( m= 0), net of the worker's wage w. From the rm's perspective whether a worker leaves to unemployment or to retirement is immaterial to them. Otherwise the option values are as in the case of the employed worker. Value of surplus. Imposing free entry, Vt= 0, the surplus value for a match ( ;x) in a contract (w;m) is derived by substituting the above expressions into equation (3). (r+\u000e+\u0011)Srt( ;x;m Infected young individuals Infected unemployed are too ill to search for a job. Their value functions is equal to: rUit=bu+\u001ay(Urt\u0000Uit) + 0y(`it)(0\u0000Uit) +\u0011(Rit\u0000Uit) +_Uit: In addition to the ow value associated with any unemployment their option values consist of recovering and becoming unemployed and recovered, passing away in which case they get nothing, and retiring. Infected individuals are too ill to work, but receive a sick pay w, and they return to their job upon recovery. The value for the employed infected is equal to than sick pay, the value of employed infected accounts for the option value of recovering and go back to work, of passing away because of the infection, of exogenously separating, in which case they become unemployed infected, of retiring, and of renegotiating the terms of the contract, which can lead to match destruction. Value of lled job. Employers in a match with infected employee produce nothing and are forced to a mandatory sick payment wto the worker. Their value is to option of renegotiating the terms of the contract at rate \u0017, which could lead to match destruction. A match can also destroy because of exogenous separation, occurring at rate \u000e, or because of employee death, which occurs at a rate 0y(`it). The match starts producing again upon worker recovery, occurring at rate \u001ay. Value of surplus. Given free entry, Vt= 0, the surplus of a match between an employed and a sick employee can be written - even when the employee is infected - the match surplus could be positive, as long as the continuation value is larger than the unemployment ow. In this case, the match won't cease to exist, the employer will transfer a sick pay to the employee and wait till her recovery. 24Susceptible young individuals Susceptible individuals face risk of infection. The infection rate is function of the share of infected people in the economy, `it, and it depends on the employment status: it is equal to \u00150y`itfor unemployed workers. Susceptible unemployed have the following value: which depends unemployment ow plus the option value of nding a jobs, getting infected unemployed, and retiring as susceptible. Susceptible employed di er by their job characteristics ( ;x) and their contractual arrangements, ( w;m), which in turns determine their rate of contagion. Employees working only from home ( m= 0) get infected at the same rate of unemployed workers while employees working away from home get infected at a larger rate, equal to ( \u00150y+\u00151y)`it, where\u00151ygoverns the rate of contagion at work. The value of employment for susceptible workers re ects these di erences and it the infection rates, employees with di erent home-working arrangement have similar value of employment: their matches are exogenously destroyed at a rate \u000e, they retire at a rate \u0011and renegotiate their contract a rate \u0017. Value of lled job. An employer ( ;x) matched with a susceptible employee produces p( ;x; 0) if the employee works only from home or p( ;x; 1) if the employees works away from home. Imposing free entry, Vt= 0, the value of an employer matched with a susceptible employee is equal for exogenous match destruction or worker retirement, the option values are as in the case of the susceptible employed. 25Value of surplus. Given free entry Vt= 0, total surplus for a match in a contract ( w;m) can de de for some ( ;x), it might be the case that Sst( ;x; 0)> Sst( ;x; 1). Di erently than recovered, a match with a susceptible employee might optimally set m= 0 and produce only through home-working. A.2 Dynamics of Baseline Model The evolution of the measure of unemployed workers follows dynamic system given below where the rst subindex denotes the health status H2fs;i;rgand the second the time t. _ust= +\u000eZ Z est( dx ;x)urt\u0000\u0011urt 26For measures of employed, we also need to keep track of their match quality ( ;x) and for the susceptible whether they work at home or away from home, taking subindex zero and one, respectively. Note the total susceptible employed in match ( ;x) is the sum of those employed in that match working from home and outside of the home, ;x)d dx + _oht\u0013 As discussed in the main body of the text the economy is initiated from a pre-Covid steady state. That is setting the left hand side of the di erential equations above and `itto zero. 27This yields the following initial allocation. Where the superscript ssdenotes steady state levels. uss Algorithm To solve the model we need to solve for the surplus functions denoted as Sst( ;x;m ). For example, the value of a recovered individual, who will always opt to work outside of the home, yields a surplus given by (r+\u000e+\u0011)Srt( ;x) _Srt( ;x): For this surplus function and all others we approximate the state of the economy at time t by the aggregate state vector t:= (ust;urt;`it) such that, for )): Given the surplus functions, the transitional dynamics and the free entry condition de ning ( ) can be computed exactly.13The solution algorithm works as follows. - Construct a grid for ve state variables, ( ;x; ), where := ( us;ur;Li=L) - Guess Solve xed point for Sr( ;x; ) 13The omission of the continuation value _Sht( ;x;m ) omits an equilibrium e ect from the model. That is a susceptible worker would rather become infected at the start of the pandemic, as their outside option of catching it then is smaller as they are still fairly likely in becoming infected. Thus the incentive for sus- ceptible workers to self-isolate increases as the pandemic progresses. Interestingly, this is the opposite of the behavioral argument put forward by British scientists that warned that starting the lockdown earlier could lead to fatigue and less compliance later on. While interesting this paper abstracts from this mecha- nism. 28- Solve xed point for Si( ;x; ) - Solve xed point andSs( ;x; 1; ) - Update ?( ) using free entry. Return to update surplus functions. The model is solved for 50 grid points for xand and ten for each of the aggregate states giving (502\u0002103) = 2;500;000 in total. After solutions are found for surpluses and job o er arrival rates the di erential equations de ning the aggregate states are approximated at a daily frequency. A.4 Home working hours and earnings Figure A.4: Home working hours and earnings (a) Home working distribution (b) Home working and log-earnings Data are taken from the Annual Population Survey (APS), a survey of a representa- tive sample of UK residents. Selected people are asked a number of questions about their relationship with the labor market, including questions on the extent to which they work from home. In particular, the current analysis exploits the answer reported by respondents to the following question: \"Have you ever worked at home for your main job?\". Data are then aggregated at occupational level using 3-digit codes (94 occupations in total). Figure A.4 panel (a) displays the distribution of employed workers who reported to ever worked at home, while panel (b) scatters the average share of workers reporting to work from home in each occupation against the average wage (panel b). We exploits this data in the calibration. Speci cally, we target mean and standard deviation in the distribution of home-working re- spondents across occupations and the correlation between home-working shares and wages. 29 "}
