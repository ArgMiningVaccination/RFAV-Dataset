Integrative Medicine is not New Age or radical. It is a bridge connecting conventional medicine with healing modalities that have been available for centuries. By embracing Integrative Medicine, our practitioners are empowered to view you as a whole being and focus on underlying causes for your condition. We use the following tenets of Integrative Medicine to define our practice: We treat you holistically. Your wellness is influenced by a variety of internal and external factors. We identify areas for improved health in your body, mind, spirit and environment. We are your partners in health. We work to build a strong foundational knowledge of your physical state so we can share in making informed, proactive decisions. We believe prevention of disease is the most powerful tool for better health. There are simple changes you can make today that will have long-lasting positive effects on your health and vitality.
