Natural products may follow different regulations, fromfood to therapeutics. Concerning their isolated constituents, extracts are characterized by a complexity that is not easily tackled from both a scientific and a regulatory point of view,but more importantly, from a therapeutic point of view. Theevidence-based approach applied to isolated molecules re-quires appropriate evidence of quality, efficacy, and safety.The same needs must be reached for complex substances byfinding appropriate methods to generate this evidence, and inaddition, defining an appropriate regulatory field for them. From a scientific point of view, new methods, such as those proposed by systems biology, are available and applicable tocomplex substances. From a regulatory point of view, Direc-tive 2001/83/EC on medicinal products seems to be modeledon single (or combinations of single) molecule products. Onthe other hand, Regulation 2017/745/EC on medical devicesseems to apply to complex substances without derogatingon quality, efficacy, and safety. The regulation specifically names and strengthens medical devices that include sub- stances, mostly of natural origin, introducing the official term\"medical devices made of substances \". This paper discusses and proposes an interpretation of important terms connectedto this legislation, regarding both scientific and regulatoryissues, and the opportunities the regulation may give for in-novation and therapeutic improvement with natural complexsubstances.Medical Devices Made of Substances: Possible Innovation and Opportunities for Complex Natural Products# #Dedicated to Professor Arnold Vlietinck on the occasion of his 80th birthday.Reviews 1110Bilia AR et al. Medical online: 2021-08-06Introduction The world markets offer numerous products based on natural constituents with considerable differences in their classification.The category of food supplements (FSs [dietary supplements inthe US]) holds the largest share of the whole botanical market inthe US with over 80%, while the OTC status plays a minor role withonly about 3% [1, 2]. By contrast, in Europe, the herbal marketconsists of a stable 28% of the dietary supplement segment (2015 -2019) [3]. The rest are registered drugs, even if there are some important differences among the different countries. How-ever, under the restrictions in the reimbursement situation, thissegment of FSs, as well as the self-medication OTC drugs, hasrecently started to grow, while the group of prescribed botanicalproducts is decreasing [1, 4]. Actually, in several European coun-tries, numerous botanical products are present on the market asMDs. MDs are part of mainstream medicine with a precise regula- tory structure. This sector, regulated by Directive 93/42/EEC [5], is expected to profoundly evolve after the introduction of the MDRofficially published in Europe on May 5, 2017 [6], due to the high-quality research required in all aspects of the lifecycle of an MD.The MDR specifically names and strengthens MDs, which includesubstances mostly of natural origin, and introduces the officialterm \"medical devices made of substances \"(MDMS). It will enter into force on May 26, 2021, or possibly later due to COVID-19 [7]. The healthcare system, the scientific research community, and the industrial sector should perceive this change as an opportu-nity for innovation and therapeutic improvement. European Union Legislation of Natural Products on the Market Health products based on natural products available on the EU markets include HMPs, FSs, and MDs. In the EU, botanical prod-ucts have different classifications according to their presentation, and each category has its own legal framework and criteria thathave to be fulfilled. FSs represent a large segment of botanicals, which are defined by Directive 2002/46/EC [7] as \"foodstuffs, the purpose of which is to supplement the normal diet and which are concentratedsources of nutrients or other substances with a nutritional or phys-iological effect, alone or in combination, marketed in dose form namely forms such as capsules, pastilles, tablets, pills, etc ...\"[8] FSs are sold exclusively in pre-packaged forms. Botanical FSs in-clude a wide range of natural constituents, mainly nutrients,namely amino acids, essential fatty acids, fibers, minerals, andvarious enzymes and microorganisms. Plants and herbal extractscan also be present and are defined by the directive as \"other sub- stances \"with a nutritional or physiological effect. All FSs require a recommended daily intake and dosage, and in addition, most of them report nutritional values or physiological effects on the label [3, 4]. HMPs are medicinal products where the active ingredient con- sists exclusively of HDs or HDPs as defined in Directive 2001/83/EC [9] (formerly Directive 65/65/EC [10] and amended by Direc-tive Annex I Part II point 7, 2004/27/EC [11]) on the Communitycode relating to medicinal products for human use ( \"Directive on human medicinal products \"). This Directive defines a medicinal product as \"any substance or combination of substances which may be used in or administered to human beings either with aview to restoring, correcting or modifying physiological functionsby exerting a pharmacological, immunological or metabolic ac-tion, or making a medical diagnosis \". Marketing of HMPs requires an ad hoc authorization based on quality, safety, and efficacy. Three categories of medicinal prod-ucts can be ascribed as HMPs. The \"well-established \"use author- ization is based on the evaluation of relevant available scientific data, mainly published, regarding the preparation and the pres-ence of that preparation on the European market for at least10 years. The \"traditional \"use registration is based on the medic- inal use throughout a period of at least 30 years preceding thedate of the application, including at least 15 years within the Com-munity. Finally, the third category of HMPs is represented bythose medicines whose regulatory pathway is characterized by stand-alone or mixed applications (Article 8 [3] of Directive 2001/83/EC). For these HMPs, safety and efficacy data are fromthe company s own development or a combination of their own studies and bibliographic data [12]. As already stated, a medicinal product regulated under Direc- tive 2001/83/EC is not only defined based on its therapeutic pur-pose but also on its capacity to modify physiological functionsthrough a specific mechanism of action, which needs to be PhIM. We point out that the definition of a medicinal product reported in Directive 2001/83 is one whose elements are all important forregulatory purposes. In particular, the fact that a medicinal prod-uct must reach its therapeutic effect by a pharmacological modeof action has been added to the definition by Directive 2004/27/EC, with the precise aim to \"specify the type of action that the me- dicinal product may exert on physiological functions \"(whereas 7 of Directive 2004/27). The regulatory definition of the pharma- cological mode of action is reported in Meddev 2. 1/3 rev 3 [13]:ABBREVIATIONS API active pharmaceutical ingredient Bfarm Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices of Germany Eudamed European database on medical devices FSs food supplements HDPs herbal drug preparations HDs herbal drugs HMP(s) herbal medicinal product(s) MD(s) medical device(s) MDMS medical devices made of substances Device (Regulation 2017/745/EC) OTC SmPC Summary of Product Characteristics 1111Bilia AR et al. Medical Devices Made ...Planta \"is understood as an interaction be- tween the molecules of the substance in question and a cellularconstituent, usually referred to as a receptor, which either resultsin a direct response or blocks the response to another agent.Although not a completely reliable criterion, the presence of adose-response correlation is indicative of a pharmacological ef-fect. Finally, an innovative sector of botanicals throughout Europe is represented by the MD sector with a core legal framework con- sisting of 3 main directives harmonized in the EU in the 1990s(Directive 90/385/EEC regarding active vitro diagnostic MDs, repealedby Regulation 2017/746/EC). In MDR, an MD is defined as re-ported in the box \"Definition of a medical device according to MDR \". DEFINITION OF A MEDICAL DEVICE ACCORDING TO MDR \"Medical device \"means any instrument, apparatus, appli- ance, software, implant, reagent, material or other articleintended by the manufacturer to be used, alone or in combi-nation, for human beings for one or more of the following specific medical purposes: diagnosis, prevention, monitoring, prediction, prognosis, treatment or alleviation of disease, diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, alleviation of, or compensation for, an injury or disability, investigation, replacement or modification of the anatomy or of a physiological or pathological process or state, providing information by means of in vitro examination of specimens derived from the human body, including organ, blood and tissue donations, and which does not achieve its principal intended action bypharmacological, immunological, or metabolic means, in oron the human body, but which may be assisted in its functionby such means. Accordingly, MDs claim therapeutic or diagnostic properties and have clinical indications. However, the principal intended actionof an MD is typically fulfilled by non-pharmacological means, suchas physical means (including mechanical action, physical barrier,lubrication, osmotic pressure modification, replacement of, orsupport to, organs or body functions) or chemical means (includ-ing pH modifications or any other acid-base reactions, chelation). These directives have been supplemented over time by several modifying and implementing directives, including the last techni- cal revision by Directive 2007/47/EC [13]. Starting in 2012, dis-cussions on a new regulatory framework for MDs began and ledto Regulation (EU) 2017/745 of the European Parliament and ofthe Council of 5 April 2017 on MDs [14]. The most interesting novelty of the new regulation is a more explicit acknowledgment of the importance and peculiarity ofMDs made of substances (MDMS). The new regulation also ex- pressly envisages that such products may exert their action afteroral administration and following systemic absorption. MDR iden- tifies the possibility that \"they [the MDMS], or their products of metabolism, are systemically absorbed by the human body in or-der to achieve the intended purpose \". The key terms used in the EU definition of MDs are concerned with the \"intended action \"of the device and its \"mechanism of action \", which need to be \"non- pharmacological, immunological or metabolic \".M D Ri n t e n d st o \"establish a robust, transparent, predictable and sustainable reg- ulatory framework for MDs, which ensures a high level of safety and health whilst supporting innovation \". Keeping this in mind, MDR gives new importance to existing issues, such as identifyingan interpretation of the \"non-pharmacological, immunological, and metabolic mode of action \"that allows compliance of thera- peutic botanical products to the regulatory settings delineatedby Directive 2001/83/EC or MDR, as appropriate. Now that theEuropean Commission, the Parliament, and the Council have de- cided to foster innovation through MDs made of substances, pharmacologists, physicians, and botanical experts need to con-cretely explain how botanicals can enact such innovation asMDMS. One of the most important issues is the correct interpre-tation of \"pharmacological, immunological, and metabolic mode of action \"for regulatory purposes. This issue is crucial because an inadequate interpretation would prevent the development of bo-tanical therapeutic products and stifle the called-for innovation for European patients of all ages. The Concept of Non-pharmacological Mechanisms of Action in MDMS MDMS often may have more than one non-pharmacological mechanism of action concurring to the claimed therapeutic ef- fect. This occurrence is particularly relevant because MDMS have the specificity of being composed of a very high number of mole-cules, acting in synchrony, in a way that is best represented by theconcept of \"system \". A system is indeed different from the sum of its components and includes the inter-reactions and inter-rela-tions among each molecule as well as the properties deriving fromintermolecular interactions, which can only be observed when thesystem is integral. Accordingly, MDMS require a different approach in terms of defining their active ingredients and consequent mechanism ofaction, since the mechanism of action is represented by that ofthe entire product rather than that of 1 selected single compo-nent. For MDMS and MDs made of natural substances, in particu-lar, a reproducible quality is the basis for a constant efficacy andsafety and includes the standardization of extraction methods,the chemical composition assessment, safety assessment, and proper clinical evidence of efficacy [15]. However, the theoretical and practical approach to establish the mechanisms of interactionwith cellular components for these MDs is profoundly differentfrom that of a product claiming 1 single active ingredient, and itseems important that this change in the approach should lead toa change in regulatory attitude. Approaching the problem by first identifying and selecting 1 marker of the complex natural substance and investigating that as the active principle is an approximation that may allow the de- 1112Bilia AR et al. Medical Devices the product according to Directive 2001/83/EC. This approach, however, does not account for the cooperative actionwith other components of the complex mixture that may contrib-ute to the final effect, thus not allowing to describe the mecha-nism as a single molecule mechanism of action. With further approximation, one can consider the whole ex- tract according to Directive 2001/83/EC, which introduced the registration of \"traditional herbal medicinal products \".I nt h i s case, information on the mechanism of action, relating to the pharmacodynamics chapter of the SmPC is not required, as re-ported in EU monographs part 5, citing article 16c(1)(a)(iii) ofDirective 2001/83/EC. Safety is given by the long-standing use ofthe identified extract in the identified conditions of use, while themechanism of action and the clinical efficacy of the product donot need to be demonstrated. Efficacy is assumed as plausible be-cause of the long-standing use. This approach does not allow the development of the product beyond that of traditional use and in- trinsically cannot foster innovation. It seems that the first step in moving forward with research and regulatory issues is to acknowledge that complex natural sub-stances have interactions with multiple targets, interconnectedand interrelated, but not individually identifiable and quantifiableas separate entities hierarchically organized. The therapeutic effect of these substances may be well evi- dent, but their mechanism of action cannot be described without significant approximations. We observe that medicinal productsare mostly composed of a single API and generally have 1 maintarget, and they modify body functions with mechanisms thatmostly respond to the description of the \"PhIM \"mechanism as discussed in all regulatory documents. It is our opinion that it is the lack of a valid, adequate concep- tual model describing the mechanism of action of natural com- plex substances to have hindered, so far, the development of new products and limited the possibility of unveiling new emer-gent approaches to clinical treatment of complex diseases. It isimportant to discuss how to invert this trend. The novel Regulation 2017/745, which identifies MDMS and specifies that natural complex substances may have the featuresof MDs, is introducing a great opportunity to move beyond thecurrent regulatory theoretical constraints. Now is the perfect time to discuss experimental models that will allow us to produce sci- entific information on these complex multiple target products todescribe their mechanism of action, and the role of experimentaland clinical pharmacologists will be pivotal. Ag r e a tf i e l dt oe x p l o i tw o u l db et h a to f \"systems biology \" models. These could be essential to support with pre-clinical evi-dence the putative events underlying the efficacy and safety as-sessed during product development. For MDs, the main question that remains is that of classifying these mechanisms under the definition of non-pharmacologicalmechanisms. First, it is important to bear in mind that \"therapeu- tic effect \"and\"mechanism of action \"are 2 distinct concepts [16]. As previously pointed out, the specific primary target identifi- cation is an intrinsic part of the pharmacological mechanism ofaction [16]. All regulatory documents regarding medicinal prod-ucts require the description of the pharmacodynamic features of the compound, which include the description of the receptor or,at large, of the \"target \".De facto , it seems that a product that can- not be described according to a key-lock mechanism cannot com-ply with the medicinal product regulation (Annex I of Directive2001/83/EC). Other types of interactions cannot be described according to the key-lock model due to their complexity, such as in the case ofproducts made of natural substances and combinations of sub-stances. Their mechanism of action does not fit the pharmacolog- ical, immunological, or metabolic classic paradigm with recogniz- able, targeted specific interactions and needs to be classified asnon-pharmacological to promote their proper assessment in clin-ical trials, as indicated by the new Medical Device Regulation. The EU regulatory documents for both medicinal products and MDs do not provide an explicit designation of the \"non-pharma- cological \"(and by inference non-immunological or metabolic) mechanisms of action, which, in practice, are identified in Europe with the physical and chemical modes of action. Following our previous discussions and position papers [16, 17], it is our opinion and suggestion that all reactions triggeredby complex substances, where the trigger does not match thebroadly defined targeted key-lock model, be considered from aregulatory point of view non-PhIM modes of action. This includesmultiple reactions between complex substances and the humanbody, which can be best described with a \"systems biology \"ap- proach. \"Systems biology \"is defined as \"a scientific approach that combines the principles of engineering, mathematics, physics,and computer science with extensive experimental data to devel-op a quantitative as well as a deep conceptual understanding ofbiological phenomena, permitting prediction and accurate simu-lation of complex (emergent) biological behaviours \"[18]. \"Emer- gent \"is the term most often used to describe the integrated fea- tures observed of a system. It seems important that, since the systems biology approach is based on scientific evidence, the methodological quality of thedata can be assured and the data considered reliable, by analogywith Directive 2001/83/EC. The only fundamental difference isthat in a systems biology approach, the mechanisms of action ofthe compounds can be inferred from the observed change in therelevant physiological functions of the biological systems interro- gated. This, together with other evaluations, also indicates the safety of the product. Thus, even in the absence of a specificallytargeted mechanism, it is possible not to delay the assessment ofthe product in a proper clinical setting. It has been recently dis-cussed at several levels that there should be a new concerted ef-fort to overcome methodological obstacles that hinder advancesin natural products research, and the application of \"systems biol- ogy methods \"and the advancement of \"omics-based \"technolo- gies is highly recommended [19]. This attitude pushes forward the knowledge of the history of natural products as sources ofmedicine and drives toward the discovery of multiple target signa-ture clusters of biological pathways modulated by the complexeffects of natural products. Integrating big data calculations rela-tive to each component of a complex mixture is the first step,although it is an approximation since this computation cannottake into account the intermolecular interactions among all com- ponents that influence the mechanism of action of the system. 1113Bilia AR et al. Medical Devices Made ...Planta 1110 -1116 | \u00a9 2021. The author(s). Keeping in mind all that has been said above, this mechanism of action cannot be described as pharmacologic because a specific primary target cannot define it. The issue seems not to be imme- diately intuitive. We propose to name this mechanism of action a\"physiological mechanism \"due to the multi-target nature of physiological functions. We are aware that this proposal will notbe unanimously accepted but like new proposal s hould be dis- cussed to reach a consensus. From a regulatory point of view, thebest identifier so far can be a \"non-targeted \"mechanism of ac- tion. A tentative example of the substantial difference between the 2 definitions can be found in Table 1 . The request from the institutions to look for approaches ade- quate for products made of complex substances seems furtherconfirmed by the fact, that, within MDR, MDMS may exert theiraction after systemic absorption, as reported by classification Rule21. At the same time, the impossibility of describing a natural sub-stance by the behavior of 1 single component is also confirmed bythe refusal of the Bfarm to accept the pharmacodynamics of a sin- gle component as representative of the mechanism of action or the efficacy of the entire product [20]. This seems to be a call towork on innovative complex products with new paradigms. Physician s Point of View: A Complex Approach Is Necessary for All Those Cases WhereSingle Receptor Approach Is Not Sufficient The benefits deriving from MDMS are evident especially in com- plex ailments such as gastrointestinal disorders. The pathophysio-logic mechanisms underlying chronic gastrointestinal disordersare much more complex and multifactorial than we previously be-lieved. For example, on the assumption that acid plays the mainrole in triggering heartburn, we have used for decades medical treatment based on gastric acid reduction with PPI drugs, only to conclude that the response rate of heartburn with these drugs isfar from satisfactory. We now know that the pathophysiologic mechanism of heartburn is much more complex than gastroeso- phageal acid reflux and includes non-acid reflux and reflux-in- duced immune and free radical sensitization of the esophagealperipheral nerve fibers due to the wide intercellular spaces of theesophageal epithelium. This condition is not responsive to anacid-suppressive treatment [21, 22]. Today, the possibility for anMD to be made from natural substances, and hence with morecomponents acting as a system, enables the creation of a complexcompound having, at the same time, epithelial barrier protection as well as antacid and antioxidant activities as well as other protec- tive effects. More and more, such MDs find their clinical applica-tion as add-on treatments to not fully effective PPI therapy in pa-tients not responding to PPIs or with unbearable PPI side effects aswell as during pregnancy, in childhood, and whenever PPIs arecontraindicated. It seems that complex ailments may benefit fromcomplex approaches that can address the many sides of the ail-ment. Another example of a complex gastrointestinal ailment is the traditional, and largely unsatisfactory, management of chronicconstipation [23] or constipation due to opioid administration,with aids that accelerate colonic transit by increasing the waterload with osmotic laxatives or triggering the motor activity withstimulant laxatives or mechanically emptying the bowel with ene-mas. We now know that a slow colonic transit per se , when in- duced with opioid administration in experimental models and hu- mans, leads to modification of microbiota and related metabo- lites. These observations report that short chain fatty acids are re-duced. Levels of butyrate are reduced by the peripheral \u00b5-opioid receptor agonist and anti-diarrheal agent loperamide as a resultof a decrease in butyrate-producing bacteria, and it is well docu-mented that butyrate not only maintains gut epithelial integritybut also enhances colonic motility either directly viaactivation of GPR43 on intestinal smooth muscle or indirectly through activa- tion of enteric reflex pathways [24]. Additionally, lead to pro-inflammatory cyto-Table 1 Pharmacological and nontargeted modes of action and regulatory compliance [15].

Post-marketing Surveillance and Vigilance: Eudamed Platform \"One key aspect in fulfilling the objectives of this Regulation is the creation of a European database on medical devices (Eudamed) \". In this way, the Medical Device Regulation, with respect to Direc-tive 93/42, increases the levels of evidence required for the MD, aswell as the management of the evidence produced. In this re-spect, it aligns with the world of medicinal products and pro-motes the development of innovative complex substances based on evidence during the entire life cycle of the product. One of the fields of innovation of MDR is clinical evidence. In particular, or-ganized and active PMS activities are required within the qualitysystem of the manufacturer and are collected in a structured wayin the PMS plan. Here the manufacturer identifies all the initiativeshe will carry out to constantly deepen the knowledge on its MDs inreal-life settings. The aim of PMS actions is to identify any need toapply any corrective or preventive action on the MD for the on- going increasing safety of such products. MDR also confirms the central role of vigilance in the post-mar- keting activities of a manufacturer. Vigilance includes all thoseactivities to collect and manage any report on adverse eventsand reactions regarding the MD. The single patient can report anadverse event either directly to the manufacturer or through thehealthcare professional. MDR requires the manufacturer to have avigilance reference person and a vigilance system in place. To collect and integrate data regarding the MD as well as to en- sure transparency and increase the exchange of informationamong Competent Authorities of Member States, economic oper-ators, notified bodies, and sponsors of clinical trials, Eudamed, aEU database on MDs, has been envisioned by MDR. It is an impres-sive platform that shall gather information now dislocated in dif-ferent electronic systems among the member states, regarding allaspects of an MD. The intent is that transparency will be im- proved, and the information regarding the MDs available on the EU market will be coordinated. This information is structuredaround 6 interconnected areas, called modules, which are: 1) ac-tors registration, 2) UDI/devices registration, 3) notified bodiesand certificates, 4) clinical investigations and performance stud-ies, 5) vigilance and post-market surveillance, and 6) market sur-veillance. The various modules will be made available when ready,starting from December 2020, on the Eudamed public website at \"ec.europa.eu/tools/eudamed \"[26]. Accordingly, Eudamed will have many purposes. It will work as a registration system, as a sys-tem for communication and cooperation among professionals, asa notification system, and as a dissemination system for the infor-mation that will be available to the public. It is well evident that MDR enforces constant attention on the MD before and after it is on the market. This also is an opportunityto generate and collect high-quality clinical data on complex nat- ural products to the benefit of both research and therapy.Conclusion The complexity of natural substances allows them to be allocated in different categories of products. With the issuance of Regula-tion 2017/745/EC, there is an important new opportunity for aninnovative category, the MDMS, that encourages research and de-velopment. MDs have a therapeutic intended use; by definition, they are used for the treatment or alleviation of diseases. Natural complex products seems to fill a gap found in clinics, thereforehaving an additional regulatory framework for the developmentof such products is necessary. Hence, it seems that Regulation2017/745/CE allows an adequate platform for the sound develop-ment, as MDMS, of products made of natural substances, espe-cially for the interest of the patient. By analogy with medicinalproducts, the clinical data required to claim any \"intended pur- pose \"have been strengthened with respect to the previous legis- lation, and the safety of the device needs to be continuously con-firmed by post-market clinical follow-up activities. It seems also that natural substances, because of their com- plexity, need different scientific paradigms to generate and inter-pret the evidence produced with them. Consequently, it is impor-tant to promote discussion among professionals regarding thesescientific issues, as well as the relative regulatory consequences. It is our opinion that complex substances need to be augmented with an extremely constructive and open-minded approach. We do feel that it is important to recognize that their features cannot be approximated to those of a single molecule or even tothose of a combination of single molecules. Our analysis is thatalthough single molecules can be best described by the key-lockmodel, which underlies the \"pharmacological, immunological and metabolic action \"of medicinal products, complex substances do not fit this model. We bring forward that where the key-lock model does not apply, such as in natural complex substances,the mechanism of action cannot be regarded as pharmacological,immunological, or metabolic. Natural substances allow bothapproaches: that which isolates the active principles and thatwhich keeps the complexity of the starting material. Each ap-proach allows the development of products that have a role intherapeutics; therefore, it seems of great importance to have both approaches concretely available. It appears that now is the time for both researchers and regulators to develop new, evidence-based innovative products for the many unmet medical needsand European priorities, among which is also the need for prod-ucts with high environmental sustainability.
