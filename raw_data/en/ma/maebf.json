The service includes its very own herbal medicine dispensary, where patients can receive their herbal medicines; prescribed by Herbal Medicine Practitioner and Medical Doctor, Dr. Irka Ebanks. What is Complementary & Alternative Medicine Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) consists of a plethora of therapies, for example, Traditional Chinese Medicine, Acupuncture, Ayurveda (Traditional Indian Medicine), Naturopathy, Western Herbal Medicine, yoga, massage and Chiropractor therapies. CAM works in conjunction or together with conventional medicine. It takes a very holistic approach towards healing, by supporting the body's own natural effort in achieving a balanced state of positive energy and optimum physical health. CAM considers health to be a consortium between physical, social and mental wellbeing. A variety of approaches are taken with CAM to stimulate or encourage the body to restore and heal, depending on the person's condition. Various types of CAM approaches include the use of natural products/herbal remedies, mind and body practices and other complementary health approaches. CAM may also encourage the use of naturopathic medicine, which embraces the idea that one should not only attack symptoms of illness, but attack it at its root cause, which may be influenced by poor diet, lack of sleep, mental health struggles and other situational factors that can adversely influence one's physical and mental health. As many traditional Caymanians believe and have practiced, specific herbs are effective in healing 'suffering' areas of the body and mind, treating them, with an aim for restoration to a state of normality. Herbal remedies should be treated with caution, as they are medicines - persons should be aware that there are possible interactions with pharmaceutical medications, supplements and other herbs. CAM practices have been proven effective for treating and addressing a variety of mental and physical conditions, including high blood pressure, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), anxiety/depression, insomnia, smoking cessation and more.
