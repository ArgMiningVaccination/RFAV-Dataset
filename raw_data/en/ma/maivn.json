There is a lot of scope for students opting for life sciences in the near future. CBSE has introduced Life Sciences as an optional course at secondary and Senior Secondary level. Scientists today are capable of generating more data in a day than their predecessors 20 years ago could have generated in an entire career. This ability to rapidly generate data has also created a number of new scientific challenges. We are no longer in an era where data can be processed by loading it into a spreadsheet and making a couple of graphs. In ord er to distil scientific knowledge from these datasets, we must be able to identify and extract nonobvious relationships. This book is divided into 4 units and each unit has 3 to 4 sessions. All the topics are covered in simple language, with pictures to ma ke it more interesting. As homework, at the end of every unit there is a set of questions, for revision purpose. The team of authors is thankful to CBSE (Skill Education) for their untiring efforts for bringing out the handbook on time. It is a pleasure fo r the authors to express their special thanks to the CBSE (Skill Education) advisors and other coordinating staff members. The book has been made with lot of efforts, still there may be some errors, so valuable suggestions from the readers will be apprecia ted for further improvement of this handbook in future. 4 Contents Unit -1 Facts about Covid -19 and Vaccination 1.1.

Do you know what exactly is it? And why coronavirus is spreading at such high rate? Let's figure out in the upcoming section . Viruses are tiny particles that can invade living cells. There are millions of varieties of viruses , with different behaviours , shapes, and structures . Coronaviruses are one group, named for their crown -shaped structure . Four of these viruses commonly infect humans. A lot of times , when you catch cold, it's caused by a coronavirus. Any virus has one goal: to replicate, or make more copies of itself. But it can't do that on its own, so it enters our body and turns its 8 cells into virus factories. This can be unpleasant for us, the organism that the virus has infected. The new coronavirus typically causes coughing and fever. A healthy body can usually fight this illness, known as COVID -19, on its own. Symptoms are mild for most people, especially kids. But in a body with weakened defences , COVID -19 can become more severe and require medical treatment. Some people get seriously ill, and that has gotten everyone's attention. This new coronavirus was first identified in Wuhan, China. In late 2019, there was an outbreak and that's when the disease start ed spreading. More and more people got sick, first in China and then around the world. Entire cities have been quarantined, or closed to control the virus spread. This virus is the one that caused a pandemic in 2020. COVID is the new disease that spread all over the world and infected many people . We have observed that this virus can spread very easily via vectors like objects we have touched through sneezing or coughing this can cause many people to get sick during the process of transmission that's why the disease has spread worldwide . Fortunately, viruses can't get around without our help. And there's a lot we can do to stop them from growing! Like washing your hands, especially after you use the bathroom and before you eat. That 's always a good idea, and you probably already do it. Scrub with soap for at least 20 seconds to make sure you don't miss any spots. Whenever you cough or sneeze, cover your nose and mouth to help keep any germs contained. And if you're sick, avoid meetin g other people as you definitely wouldn't want to infect them, even if it's a plain old cold. Well, when there's an outbreak where you live, experts recommend some added precautions. Like social distancing: limiting close contact with other people, even if you're not sick. Hang out at home with your family, and keep up with your friends online. That gives the virus fewer opportunities to spread around. Lots of outbreaks have been stopped when people just follow these simple rules. Yes, it's true that some p eople have died after being infected by the 2019 coronavirus. That's because the virus can cause severe infect ion in a person's lung and make it hard to breathe. 1.2 Symptoms of coronavirus It affects people in different ways, it could be mild and can be treated at home, or severe cases needs hospitalizatio n Most common symptoms: 9 fever cough tiredness loss of taste or smell Less common symptoms: sore throat headache aches and joint pains diarrhoea a rash on skin, or discolouration of fingers or toes red or itchy eyes Serious symptoms: difficulty in breathing or shortness of breath loss of speech or mobility, or confusion loss of smell & taste chest pain Seek immediate medical attention if you have serious symptoms. Always call before visiting your doctor or health facility. People with mild symptoms who are otherwise healthy should manage their symptoms at home. On an average , it takes 5 -6 days from when someone is infected with the virus for symptoms to show, however it can take up to 14 days. 10 Those are the stories we hear about most online and in the news. But the vast majority of cases have been mild. If you feel overwhelmed by the news, consider limiting how much you let in. Instead of cable news and social media, stick to sources like the World He alth Organization. They'll give you the big picture not just the scary snapshots that make the headlines. And they're organizing experts all over the world to get this coronavirus under control. Still, it's totally normal if the situation's made you a litt le anxious. Talk to a trusted adul t they can help you put your feelings in perspective. 1.3VACCINES You must have heard that a large number of people are getting vaccinated every day . But what are vaccines and how does it protect you from Covid -19. Let's understand A vaccine is like a shield that protects you from an illness. 1.4 How does vaccines work? To understand how vaccine work s, let us understand how our body react s when any germ enters our body . When any germ enters our body, our immune system recognizes it and various types of cells come to kill that germ and protect us. Apart from this our body also remembers this germ for next time if it enters our body and generate same response . In the 11 same way, Vaccines educate your body how to defe nd itself against diseases. They do this by implanting a small bit of the germ that causes the illness you need protection from (or something that looks like the germ) into your body, which allows your body to learn how to resist it. This way, if you come into contact with the illness, your body will know exactly what to do, and you will not become ill. In case of coronavirus vaccine, a part of weakened coronavirus is put in our body and our body fights against it and remembers it. Next time, when real coronavirus enters your body, your body is easily able to fight against it and protect you from its ill effects . You have been vaccinated for various diseases in your childhood. Ask your parents to show you vaccination record to you. Note down the number of vaccinate you have got till now. 1.5 ACTIVITY Prepare a list of Covid -19 symptoms. Write if you or someone in your family have felt any of these symptoms TEST YOURSELF 1. What does the \"19\" in \"COVID -19\" refer to? A. There are 19 forms of the coronavirus. B.

Limit contact with others You should ensure that you avoid coming into close contact with others especially those who are older, unwell, or have symptoms of the virus. If, a person lives within a community where coronavirus is present, the relevant government will have additional instructions on how to implement social distancing. These may include: staying home from work or working from home avoiding contact with anyone who is not a member of the household prohibiting large gatherings of people closing non -essential services, including bars and restaurants Staying home if unwell If a person has mild symptoms of COVID -19, they can self -isolate by staying at home and avoiding contact with others. Even if a person is unsure whether they have COVID -19, a common cold, or something else, it is best to stay inside and rest. 2. Wash hands Washing your hands is one of the easiest ways to protect yourself and others from illnesses such as food poisoning and flu. You should wash your hands for the amount of time it takes to sing \"Happy Birthday\" twice (around 20 seconds): 15 Wet your hands with water. Apply enough soap to cover your hands . Rub your hands together. Use 1 hand to rub the back of the other hand and clean in between the fingers. Do the same with the other hand. Rub your hands together and clean in between your fingers. Rub the back of your fingers against your palms. Rub your thumb using your other hand. Do the same with the other thumb. Rub the tips of your fingers on the palm of your other hand. Do the same with other hand. Rinse your hands with water. Dry your hands completely with a disposable towel. Use the disposable towe l to turn off the tap. When to wash hands? You should wash your hands: After using washroom Before and after handling raw food like meat and vegetable Before and after eating After blowing your nose, sneezing, or coughing Before and after treating cut or w ound After touching animals, including pets, their food, and after cleaning their cages 16 Washing your hands properly removes dirt, viruses, and bacteria to stop them spreading to other people and objects, which can spread illnesses 3. Wear face masks Wearing a face mask can control the spread of coronavirus from a person to another . Let 's understand the guidelines for wearing s face mask How and when to use face masks? According to the World Health Organization (WHO) , people should wear a face mask in public when it is not possib le to maintain at least 1 meter distance from others. Face masks are only effective if a person uses them correctly. Take the following steps to use and dispose of a face mask correctly: Before touching the mask or the face, wash the hands with soap and wa ter for at least 20 seconds. Make sure that the mask covers the nose and mouth, with no gaps between the face and the mask. 17 While wearing the mask, avoid touching it. If a person does touch the mask while wearing it, they should wash the hands again. Avoid reusing single -use masks. Do not write anything, such as a person's name, on the mask. This damages mask integrity and could allow contaminants to enter. Replace a mask if it becomes damp. Remove the mask by lifting the string at the back, rather than by touching the front. Discard used masks immediately into a closed garbage bin, then wash the hands again. 2.2 TESTS FOR COVID -19 Nose Swab test - You have heard there's a virus going around that can make people fee l sick. A virus is a germ and it's so tiny you can't even see it . Some people who get this virus can have a fever or a cough and may feel achy and tired well . You may or may not be feeling sick so you will need to go through a test so we know how to best proceed wi th your medical care . This medical test will tell us if you have the virus . When you go to take your test , the healthcare provider will wear special protective clothing . They w ear this clothing to keep themselves and you safe from getting germs . They will wear a mask to cover their nose , mouth and a clear plastic shield to protect their eyes The most important thing during your test is to sit straight and stay calm. You may take help from your parent or caregiver to help you take test properly. The healthcare provider needs to touch the inside of the back of your nose with the long skinny tip . To do this you need to hold your chin 18 up so the healthcare provider can put the tip in your nose for a short time to collect a sampl e. While this happens, you may want to push the tip away but it's really important to stay as still as possible so the healthcare provider can finish the test .
