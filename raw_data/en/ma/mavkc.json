The INANP website was created as an extension of our dedication to providing a valuable resource for the Indiana community and beyond, offering useful and up to date information about the field of naturopathic medicine and the dedicated naturopathic doctors currently working in the state of Indiana. The naturopathic medical model emphasizes prevention, the use of natural medicines, patient education, and patient partnership. The INANP is a group of naturopathic doctors that collectively provide a wide array of complementary and alternative medical services to the members of our communities. Our members are graduates of the US Department of Education accredited 4 year graduate-level naturopathic medical schools. While Indiana does not license naturopathic doctors at this time, all of our professional members maintain a license as a naturopathic doctor from another US state or Canadian province. The INANP is a not for profit organization and is affiliated with the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians (AANP). Sign up for the INANP newsletter for naturopathic health tips and updates on Indiana ND licensure.

INANP is a 501 (c)(6) organization; thus donations are not tax-deductible. In states that license naturopathic physicians, the profession is regulated. In these states, naturopathic physicians must pass a national board examination (NPLEX) and must have completed their education at a CNME accredited four-year graduate-level, naturopathic medical school. For more information about the CNME or NPLEX please see our Education page. Licensed naturopathic physicians must fulfill state-mandated continuing education requirements annually, and will have a specific scope of practice defined by their state's laws. Their actions are subject to review by a state board of examiners to ensure the protection of the patient. Indiana has a pathway to licensure for Naturopathic Physicians. If you would like to support the licensure of naturopaths in Indiana, please contact your local legislators to let them know you value naturopathic medicine.
