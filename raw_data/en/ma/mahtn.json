Had my first shot on the 9/4. Woke up feeling fine until lunch time when I was driving to the supermarket. I turned my head and it instantly went hot and I went super dizzy to the point I had to pull over. that subsided until I had my second shot which was 9/25 (both Pfizer) I was okay initially, until I went away with work 2 weeks after my shot. I'd had a few drinks with some work friends but nothing huge (maybe 3/4) and went to bed. Woke up an hour later with the same hot rush and instant dizziness and tinnitus. The first 2 weeks were extremely intense for me to the point I am now on antidepressants. I have been to 5 different doctors all saying different things and not one saying it could be due to the vaccine. I have multiple hospital visits to be turned away with a diagnosis of anxiety. Ive had mri, ct scan, blood tests, physiotherapy and seen a chiropractor and also attempted raki. All done nothing. I've been on steroids to no avail and tried soooo much supplements it's not funny. I think the antidepressants are helping in the form of anxiety but my physical symptoms are still there and stopping me from doing day to day things including work. my symptoms include dizziness but not so much vertigo feels more like my mind is super slow are reacting to my movements. Like I could try to look to the left but my brain isn't reacting quick enough. Super wobbly and heavy. tinnitus in both ears high pitch squeal constantly I get the shakes in the morning and feel very disorientated. this has been going on now for 2 months and it's effecting me so bad that I can't enjoy doing stuff with my husband and 3 children [Tque](https://vestibular.org/participant/tiffanyquarisagmail-com/) [BetterDaysAhead](https://vestibular.org/participant/ncoleston/)and [BetterDaysAhead](https://vestibular.org/participant/ncoleston/)reacted [@arica30]it's truly horrible can't believe how badly my body has been affected this has caused so much toxic in my body. I was really fit and healthy before this hope we get relief. Just don't know how long it will take hopefully not over a year I completely understand and feel the same. I was insanely fit & healthy. I own a gym with a nutrition program. I never get sick, never had the flu shot, only had the flu once when I was 16 (I'm 45), haven't had a cold in over 20 years. I've never ate any meat my entire life, never drink/smoke, use only natural clean products on my body, etc. I fought against the mandate, couldn't get an exemption, got the shot on 11/3, had a few weird twinges and feelings (no fever, headache, etc), then on 11/5 everything hit me. I've been in the ER 4 times in 9 days. This is no way to live. Gullain Barre syndrome is now listed as a side effect for the vax. I'm thinking that is what I had. Not a severe case but my symptoms line up with it. I think this may be mine as well. I can't imagine that \"inflammation\" caused my nerves to feel the way they did. Instead, it felt like my nerves were being attacked from the inside. It was an actual assault on them. How are you recovering? What do you think made our bodies think our nerves were an enemy? I do not think the technology is right. To train your body to produce something that it then attacks IS INDEED teaching your body to attack itself. It's like making your relative dress up like a boogeyman to then \"scare off\" so you can learn to sleep at night. Alright alright, but what if you end up pushing your relative down the stairs and they break their leg. We shouldn't be mixing friends with enemies. How are you feeling now? Seems like even you have had nerves issues. Not to good. For some reason I'm feeling cold throughout my torso's nerves. This is different than feeling cold as it is just the nerves that are cold. I also have not been able to sleep because my entire nervous system does weird things. I was told by a doctor that I have mild variant of gullian Barre syndrome. Have the pins and needles in hands and legs since first Pfizer. I also sometimes get a strange coldness in my legs at times which is a different coldness to being out in cold weather if that makes sense? Yes, the coldness in my back is not cold weather. It's my nerves having some kind of weird issue. [@medee](https://vestibular.org/participant/medee/) Hey Dee! Oh yes, I had really bad nerve pain in my neck and the sides of my temples for many months that came and went I know exactly what you mean! Like a buzzy, nervey feeling on the sides of my face and head! I noticed they came on after I ate any foods high in histamine and a functional medicine doctor told me it could be over sensitive nerves, a histamine reaction or a \"paradoxical\" reaction to supplements I wasn't tolerating. So with that I scrapped most supplements and did a low histamine diet (you can easily google foods which are high in histamine), I also have an oxalate sensitivity so once I avoided those foods the nerve feeling got much better I still have it every once in awhile but it usually only lasts about 10-15 minutes whereas before it was hours or all day My pinky toes still get numb sometimes and hands feel pins and needles at night, maybe a magnesium deficiency? I'm getting my B6, B12 and Vitamin D tested and we'll see if any thing shows up, I'm sure we're probably deficient in who even knows what... How are you feeling these days? (My second vaccine was on 7/17) [@yoki](https://vestibular.org/participant/yoki/) It is very helpful reading posts like this for me because I am still thinking about taking second shot. But I am still a bit scared. So far it is not mandatory in my country but government pushes a lot and my freedom is limited quite a lot. I was tested positive for Covid in September, but fortunately my symptoms were very mild. But anyway I do not feel protected well against covid and would like to take second shot. [@medee]Hey Dee!

(My second vaccine was on 7/17) I don't know what I'm feeling and how I'm feeling these days. My main issue is nerve near my thighs acting up. It pain and burns at times and my arms feel weak too. But its not always. Sometimes both of it is all good and sometimes, I feel so weak. The tingling and tremors are not that constant like during the initial days; however, when it does it quite higher than before. Right at this moment, I have a nerve tingling on my face which I didn't have before. I have a neuro appointment today. I don't know how to feel about it. I'm just hoping the doctor is understanding and won't tell me I'm crazy. I hope whatever that I'm going through is a temporary episode and that the medicines he prescribes will heal me completely. [@medee](https://vestibular.org/participant/medee/) Oh dear I'm so sorry to hear that. I also had 2 MRIS and a CT scan and they didn't find anything significant except a bulging disc in my neck which explained some nerve and neck pain. But my pain management doctor said the neck injury was very small and wasn't causing my symptoms. He said the nerves are just very sensitive from the chemicals and inflammation and should hopefully resolve with time. He offered steroid shots but I declined because they have many side effects. Neurologists prescribed nerve pain medicine and muscle relaxers also but I declined all because I'm so nervous about side effects since our bodies are already very sensitive. I did acupuncture for 7 weeks also in the very beginning and that was helpful for me I highly suggest cutting out gluten, pasteurized dairy and foods that increase inflammation since that's a major cause of our nerve pains. That was the biggest help for me and I felt better about 4 days after just changing my diet Please do keep us posted and I hope you feel much better very soon! [@lmkk](https://vestibular.org/participant/lmkk/) Thankyou it defiantly happens in waves that's for sure with me. I hope you are doing ok? [@medee]Oh dear I'm so sorry to hear that.

I woukd try the medication if that can help. I also see deficiency of Vitamin D can also lead to all of this. My reports say that I am. Though I am not denying that the vax fucked up our system. What is taking these supplements help use restore our health? So for you they ruled out it to be a major health issue? Did they say it'll heal with time? Did you do any test for inflammation? Hi guys I came back to give everyone some hope as I am 95% better. I had my last injection (2 of 2) 2 months ago and it didn't really affect me until about 6 weeks ago. I had severe dizziness, nausea, heart palpitations, weird vision where the light was too bright and I sometimes felt disconnected from my own body. Weakness and fatigue. One of the worst symptoms was waiting for the new sensation of the worst panic attacks and anxiety ever. (I have never experience them prior to vaccine.) I have been to 3 doctors and only 1 said it is definitely from the vaccine. ALL of the pharmacists said its vaccine related. I am pretty certain that the doctors are legally not allowed to say the vaccine caused our symptoms as both the doctors who said it wasn't the vaccine asked which doctor said it was. Food for thought... Here's what I believe happened in a nutshell. 1. Vaccine started showing side effects after 2 weeks - Severe panic attack (Physical side effect, no previous history) 2. Anxiety started to build over time due to the previous panic attack and worry about health. (Mental side effect not directly related to the vaccine) 3. Dizziness, nausea gets worse with bouts of panic attacks for no reason. (Physical side effect, no previous history) 4. Anxiety worsens due to there being no answers from the doctors and previous points. (Mental side effect not directly related to the vaccine) 5. Confirmation from some people (Pharmacists and 1 doctor ) and this forum that its definitely vaccine related. (Anxiety slightly diminished) 6. More tests done confirming health is fine and backing up the previous blood, ECG tests done. (Anxiety slightly diminished) 7. Physical side effects from vaccine slowly start to diminish, dizziness, nausea, panic attacks lessen as the body heals. 8. Anxiety lessens as you start to feel better and think back to all the tests that show you are healthy. 9. Almost back to normal 6 weeks after the last vaccine side effect of panic attack, (Mental side effects and physical side effects almost back to normal) 10. Feelings of happiness start to surface and that its going to be ok after week 6. (95% better) Things that helped. 1. Prayer (I literally felt better after 2 days following prayer, please don't skip this step, pray and mean it) 2. Antihistamine just before you expect dizziness, mine always came about mid morning (I used travel sickness tablets) 3. Vitamins , I took C,B12,K2,D3, 5-HTP, Omega 3 fish oil, Quercetin, Probiotic. (I am not certain these helped but they must have at least help the body and mind recover) 4. Activated Charcoal - (THIS IS NOT NORMAL CHARCOAL,IT MUST SAY ACTIVATED CHARCOAL) After taking activated charcoal I noticed I had some improvement in side effects like dizziness and nausea. Apparently activated charcoal detoxes the body by binding to toxin in the stomach. Do not take this within 4 hours of eating anything as it will absorb the nutrients of whatever you've eaten. Google activated charcoal for more info on it but I believe it's been used for many years on patients who have ingested poison and it binds to the poison and then passes it out when you go to the loo. 5. Aspirin for any inflammation (~500mg daily) 6. REST and EATING regularly. 7. The anxiety and panic attacks from the vaccine are real and they cause terrible physical symptoms. Sometimes I didn't know which symptom was from the vaccine and which was in my head caused by anxiety (No previous disorder). You experience symptoms from both. For the panic attacks and anxiety as a last resort, I asked my doctor to prescribe me anxiety meds to alleviate the terrible feelings. I used the anxiety meds sparingly as I didn't want to become addicted to a benzodiazepine. I no longer need them but they did help at the worst of times when side effects got bad. I am not a doctor, the above is my experience. Please speak to your doctor before trying any medication etc. to make sure doesn't cause any severe reactions with you. I hope this helps someone. It WILL get better. My massive turning point was also when I realized the anxiety is me worrying about what the vaccine does and its VERY real side effects. Once I could distinguish between the 2, I felt a lot calmer. (I only got this confirmation of my health after the 2 sets of bloods and 2 ECG's being normal) P.S. Alcohol and smoking aggravates symptoms in my experience.

I hope you are doing ok? I'm feeling much better pins and needles wise! They are at a point now where they are mostly so mild that I forget about them for large parts of the day... total opposite to the first two months of hell where I could only think about them all day because of how strong and painful they were. I'm still have vision problems on and off and a bit of dizziness flare up but I am putting the dizziness down to a sip of coffee I had yesterday. I knew it would cause me problems but I was making a cup for my husband and it smelt so good I couldn't resist. Couple of hours later I felt like I was on a yet ski bobbing up and down in a rough sea storm. Guess I'm going to have to stick to getting my fix by sniffing the coffee haha!

I would think that you now have some natural immunity because of your exposure. So you are protected. Dee/Medee, thank you for your extensive informative reply that I feel is worth a try for all of us on here. Because I am a long term sufferer from eight months out I to want to share something. I am currently in Mexico, the Yucat\u00e1n to be specific next door to Guatemala and Belize, ancient Mayan country. Two days ago I treated myself with a two hour massage with a local Massuse who used eucalyptus oil and leaves plus other natural ingredients for the best massage I have ever experienced. Since I had my last Pfizer jab , my migraines have increased to daily and the Massuse must have picked up on that as he massaged several tender spots on my head and face. I then had an epiphany and heard inside my head \"your migraines will end\". Now you may stop reading and tell yourself this person is crazy, but given I haven't had one for two days now, I'm hoping and praying I'm not and that they are gone and I had a healing. If I am crazy that's okay too as I have been feeling like crap for too long and it's great to now say \"I feel great, wonderful pain free and HAPPY\". Yes there is hope and it comes in strange ways. Thank you. see my reply to Dee/MeDee. It was for "}
