Acupuncture is a form of healing that has been practiced for thousands of years, originating in China. It involves the insertion of tiny sterile needles into specific points on the body to influence the energy flow in the body which in turn aids healing and maintains health. As acupuncture is a natural form of health care it is associated with minimal side effects. Many people consult a human acupuncturist but did you know that it is equally effective in our pets? An acupuncture appointment usually takes about 30 minutes and can be use in a wide range of species including dogs, cats, rabbits, horses and goats. There is a long list of conditions that respond favourably to acupuncture. Some of these include: - Musculo-skeletal - back pain, osteoarthritis, cruciate disease, lameness, post surgical pain - Digestive - colitis, constipation, diarrhoea. - Neurological - facial paralysis, vestibular disease, pain - Respiratory - asthma, bronchitis, sinusitis. - Urogential - renal failure, cystitis, incontinence, reproductive disorders. - Behavioural - anxiety, depression. - Dermatological - allergies, ear conditions "}
