DISCLAIMER FOR 2015 .................................................................................................................................................................. 91 Executive Summary The Arizona Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey is an annual state -wide survey of adults aged 18 years and older. The Arizona survey is a collaborative effort between the Population Health Survei llance Branch (PHSB) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Health Promotion; other CDC centers; and federal agencies, such as the Health Resources and Services Administration, Administration on Aging, Department of Veterans Affairs, a nd Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and the Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS). The landline telephone sample design is a random digit dialed methodology with a disproportionate stratification based on phone bank density, and whether or not the phone numbers were directory listed. The sample of cell phone numbers was randomly selected from dedicated cellular telephone banks sorted on the basis of area code and exchange. This report summarizes data on health- related quality of life, preventive practices, barriers to healthcare, health risk behaviors, beneficial health practices, and health conditions and limitations as reported by Arizonans. Arizona response variables should be understood to be the weight -adjusted percentage of survey participants who are asked the question s and provided an informative response (excluding non- respondents, those who refused to respond, and those who indicated that they did not know how to respond). Because of this, results for the Arizona BRFS S survey in this report will differ slightly from the CDC -provided Arizona response tables in the appendix, which include some of these response categories. Additionally, the variable names used by Arizona could vary between CDC and Arizona data results. Any inference drawn from these results about the Arizona general population should be made in consideration of the confidence intervals provided within the report. In 2015, Arizona Sample design c onsisted of six regions with 7,946 combined cell phone and landline (complete and partial) interviews . The BRFSS survey provides a rich source of state -level public health data. Th is data has become integral to health promotion, disease prevention and intervention planning throughout Arizona.

In 2013 , the BRFSS survey was affected by the federal sequestration and faced a drastic budget shortfall. The Arizona's BRFSS data users group met on December 12, 2012. This meeting was also available by teleconference allowing the collaboration of state -wide stakeholders to participate in mitigating Arizona's BRFSS immediate budget crisis. The decision was made unanimously by those who participated in the December 12, 2012 m eeting to collapse the counties (a.k.a. regions/strata) from 15 to 6 regions in order to reduce the cost to administer the survey. In addition, during this meeting there was a discussion on shifting the primary funding responsibility from CDC to AD HS progr ams and outside stakeholders by increasing the cost for each State -Added question from $3,100 in 2013 to $4,100 in the 2014 survey year, with an additional increase of $1,000 per question for each subsequent year. In 2015, the cost per question s was $5,100. In 2015, the Arizona length of BRFSS questionnaire survey was within 23 minutes. Certain activities or behaviors increase the risk of mortality and morbidity. Promotion of cessation programs, awareness, and policy changes will help reduce the impact of these behaviors. Many programs and policies have been enacted to reduce the burdens associated with participating in these risky behaviors. Continued monitoring of these behaviors will provide Arizona with a tool to assess the impact of these programs and policies. T he BRFSS is comprised of CDC's Core, Modules, and State -added questions . Core component consists of three areas: The fixed core is made up of standard questions that are asked by every state. The rotating core is a set of biennial questions. The emerging core questions are experimental questions (up to 5 a year) that are asked to determine their potential use. M odules included in the 2015 survey : Diabetes O ption al CDC modules are sets of questions that focus on specific topics such as: Cognitive Decline State added questions are generated by stakeholders and ADHS Programs : Cognitive Decline Adult Asthma History Child Questions (part of RCS) Hearing Healthcare Preconception Health/ Family Planning Food Assistance/Security Sugar Drinks Substance Abuse E-Cigarettes Nearest Intersection S tate added questions must be validated and approved by CDC's and Arizona's Human Subjects Review Board . 3Methodology In 2011, CDC implemented a methodological change in how BRFSS data are weighted; specifically, the weighting method changed from post -stratification to iterative proportional fitting ( refer to the 2011 Annual Arizona BRFSS Report for more details ). The iterative pr oportional fitting (or \"raking,\") replacement was needed in order to include analysis for imperfections in the sample that might lead to bias. In addition, this method included the selection of units with unequal probabilities, non-coverage of the populat ion, and non- response. The \"raking\" adjusts the data so that groups which are underrepresented in the sample can be more accurately represented in the final dataset. The raking incorporates additional demographic characteristic s and it accurately matches sample distributions to known demographics. Furthermore, the use of raking reduces non-response bias and has been shown to reduce within- error estimates. BRFSS raking integrates a multitude of categories such as age by gender; marital status, education at tainment, employment status, income, age groups, race and ethnicity, telephone source, and renter/owner status. Thus, BRFSS 2013 annual report included the respondents contacted by landline and cellular phones. In 2015, according to the Pew Research Center 's Internet and American Life Project, found that \"92% of American adults have cell phones . Cellphone -only households are especially prevalent among younger families and among certain racial/ethnic groups. Moreover, it was evident that people were using their cell phones. \"1 One anticipated change to Arizona's BRFSS' sample design is to increase the number of cell phone participants by changing the screening process. BRFSS would be unable to fully capture disease and prevalence trends by continuing to rely solely upon landlines. In another change from 2011, if a cell phone respondent received a call from a BRFSS interviewer, and they had a landline, they were excluded from the survey. This eliminated a large number of willing cell phone respondents. Therefore, beginning with the 2012 survey, the CDC applied a fully overlapping sample. Under this approach, some of the counties will not be able to achieve the minimum of 50 participants. This might affect the ability to analyze the data for those counties with the required minimum number of participants. In 2015, the analyses will have to be done within each of the six different strata. CDC contracts with Marketing System Group (MSG) who developed a methodology for constructing cellular sampling frames using rate centers. A rate center delineates the local call boundaries set by service providers for billing purposes. MSG can identify subsets of c ellular blocks for all wireless service pr oviders that correspond to the area of interest. Geographic stratification is available for the cell phone sample for 2015. To make the best use of this method, geo -strata should consist of contiguous counties. Weights will be produced for the combined landline and cell phone data. The Arizona BRFSS previously followed CDC's guidelines regarding the rule of not reporting or interpreting percentages based upon a denominator of fewer than 50 respondents, as well as regions with adult populations less than or equal to 500 residents . Confidence interval limits for Arizona measure as upper and lower brackets connected by a single line at the top of each table column. In 2015, Arizona's sample size consisted of 7,946 complete and partial interviews. Changes to the 2015 AZ BRFSS Annual Report The 2015 BRFSS Annual Report has a layout that provides the reader information that corresponds to core and state- added questions covering a number of health risks and chronic diseases . At the beginning of each section a description of the data ele ments is presented , including variable names. Each subsection includes, in most instances, 5 -y ear trend data, national, r egional and county information data (presented as map s ), and a table of respondent demographics co mparing Arizon a to National respondents. The demographics table contains the N , percent and associated confidence interval. The appendix contains additional information to provide the reader with information regarding death, birth, and number of patients discharged from the hospital. Tables and charts presented in the Healthcare Cost & Utilization Section (Appendix A) areproduced from data collected in the Hospital Discharge Data (HDD) database. The information is presented in the same order as information in the core BRFSS 2015 report. Information presented in Appendix A utilized the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9 and ICD-10) which is the World Health Organization's 9th and 10th revision and represents data from January 1, 2015 - September 30, 2015 (ICD-9) and October 1, 2015 - December 31, 2015 (ICD-10) due to ICD-10 implementation on October 1, 2015. Due to the enhancements made to ICD-10 data are split because of their contents. Additionally, information for some questions may not contain national comparisons due to the questions being state-a dded. 1 (Rainie, Lee, Pew Research Center's Internet & American Life Project) Washington, D.C., 2002 -2016, Web accessed: 3/9/2017 http://www.pewinternet.org/chart/mobile -phone -ownership/ 4Arizona Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance 2015 Survey Arizona Strata by Region 5Arizona Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance 2015 Survey Arizona Strata by County Code 6BRFSS Survey in Comparisons The BRFSS is the largest telephone survey conducted in the United States and its ' territories. As the BRFSS grows and improves its methodology, the number of requests for localized health analysis increases. In response to the growing demand, CDC analyzes BRFSS data for metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas (MMSA). The analysis of Arizona MMSAs includes Nogales, Phoenix - Mesa -Scottsdale, Sierra Vista -Douglas, Tucson and Yuma. Any further analysis will require combining BRFSS data across multiple year s, and/or harmonizing across surveys. There are many other surveys currently sponsored by the U.S. government and its agencies, many of which have questions that overlap with the BRFSS. The structure of the questions found within commonly merg ed datasets i s displayed in Table 2 (below). Table 2.

HRQoL research potentially can incorporate physical activity, amount of time spent at work, physical health, mental health, emotional health and personality questions.2 The CDC has created a manual on using the BRFSS data to assess HRQoL. The methodology utilizes self -reported health status, mental health, physical health and inhibited socialization due to poor health. The assessment of HRQoL using BRFSS data is as follows3: Self-reported health status (variable - GENHLTH ) - Convert into a binary variable where good to excellent health is a positive outcome; poor and fair health is a negative outcome . Frequent Mental Distress (variable - MENTHLTH ) - Generate a binary variable where reporting 14 or more days of poor mental health are a negative outcome . Frequent Physical Distress (variable - PHYSHLTH ) - Generate a binary variable where reporting 14 o r more days of poor physic al health are a negative outcome. Barriers to Socialization (variable - POORHLTH) - Generate a binary variable where reporting 14 or more days of poor physical or mental health prevented daily activities are a negative outcome. Number of Unhealthy Days The majority of Arizonans report zero unhealthy days; however, the second largest category is reporting 30 unhealthy days (se e Figure 1 ) Unhealthy days are an estimate of the overall number of days during the previous 30 days when the respondent felt that his or her physical or mental health was not good. To obtain an estimate of a person's overall unhealthy days, respondents are asked, \"Now, thinking about your physical health, which includes physical illness and how many days during the past 30 days was your physical health not good? And, now thinking about your mental health, which includes stress, depression and emotions, for how many days during the past 30 days was your mental health not good?\" These are added together with a logical maximum of 30 unhealthy days . Figure 1: Arizonans who reported unhealthy days in the BRFSS 2015 survey. Ho w is the Summary Index of Unhealthy Days Calculated? Unhealthy days are an estimate of the overall number of days during the previous 30 days when the respondent felt that his or her physical or mental health was not good. To obtain this estimate, responses to questions regarding Physical and Mental health are combined to calculate a summary index of overall unhealthy days, with a logical maximum of 30 unhealthy days. For example, a person who reports four physically unhealthy days and two mentally unhealthy days is assigned a value of six unhealthy days, and someone who reports 30 physically unhealthy days and 30 mentally unhealthy days is assigned the maximum of 30 unhealthy days. Healthy days are the positive complementary form of unhealthy days. A healthy day estimates the number of recent days when a person's physical and mental health was good (or better) and is calculated by subtr acting the number of unhealthy days from 30 days. 2 Ware, J.E., & Sherbourne, C.D.

Health Related Quality of Life: Self-Reported Health Status Self-reported health status is one of the most frequently assessed health perceptions in epidemiological research.4 As a health -related q uality of life indicator, it is a multi -dimensional concept that is related to physical, mental, emotional and social health.5 It has proven to be a more dominant predictor of mortality and morbidity than many objective measures of health. 6 Self- rated heal th status also has been shown to be a significant predictor for the onset of coronary heart disease, diabetes, stroke, lung disease, and arthritis . 7 Self- assessed health status has been validated as a useful indicator of health among different populations and allows for broad comparisons across a variety of health conditions. 8 Figure A: Arizona and National BRFSS 2011- 2015 S urvey respondents who r eported that their health status was excellent, good or very good. In the 2015, BRFSS surveys 81.2% of Ariz onans reported that they had good, very good or excellent health close to the national figure of 83. 6% (see Figure A). 4 Mossey JM, Shap iro E.

Results are shown by sex, age categories, marital status, educational attainment, employment status, income and race/ethnicity. The \"Nationwide\" estimates are median values across all states, not means. The \"National\" level estimates reported here use medians because no national stratum was defined in the 2015 BRFSS survey . Survey results at the national level were not adjusted or weighted to produce a national mean result. 11Survey Question: Now thinking about your mental health, which includes stress, depression, and problems with emotions, for how many days during the past 30 days was your menta l health not good? Health Related Quality of Life: Frequent Mental Distress By 2020, depression is projected to be the second leading cause of the global disease burden. Research has shown that depression and other mental health conditions are associated with an increased prevalence of chronic diseases. The association is a complex self -propagating interrelationship between chronic disease and mental illness. 9 For example, an individual may initially suffer from a chronic disease and then develop a mental health condition (i.e., depression), which exacerbates the initial condition. Another individual could suffer from a mental illness which could precipitate a chronic disease, and fall into an exacerbated cycle of chronic and mental health diseases. The BRFSS survey includes depression and anxiety questions within the core section. Researchers have developed and accepted an alternative method of ev aluating mental illness called 'Frequent Mental Distress' (FMD). FMD is defined as 14 days or more of poor mental health within the past 30 days. 10 Since 2011, Arizonans surveyed report FMD at similar levels to the nation al median (see Figure A). Figure A: Arizona and National 2011-2015 BRFSS prevalence of reporting frequent mental distress (14 days in past 30 -days) . In 2015, 11. 2% of Arizonans surveyed reported that they suffered from FMD; the same as the national median. When looking at the other state s in the nation, Arizona falls in the second -highest class for the percent of respond ents reporting FMD (See Figure B). 9 Chapman DP, Perry GS, Strine TW.

Health Related Quality of Life: Frequent Physical Distress Fr equent physical distress (FPD) is defined as suffering 14 or more physically unhealthy days in the past 30 days. FPD has been associated with both being underweight and with obesity. Obesity increases the risk of morbidity and mortality. Additionally, obesity increases the risk of having heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, arthritis, and some cancers. 11 Furthermore, FPD has been associated with increased risky behaviors, such as drinking and smoking in women of child- bearing age. 12 Arizonans surveyed in 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 reported FPD more frequently than the national median (see Figure A). Figure A: Arizona and n ational 2011- 2015 BRFSS prevalence of Frequent Physical Distress (FPD ) suffering 14 physical ly unhealthy days ( in the 30 days prior ). Arizona falls in the second -highest class among all states for the percent of respondents reporting FPD (see Figure B). Figu re B.

Health Related Quality of Life: Barriers to Socialization Socialization plays a significant role in public health. Research has shown that individuals who have the few est social ties have an i ncreased risk of mortality. Fur thermore, the number of social relationships is inversely related to all -cause mortality. 13 The BRFSS survey asked if a person's activities were inhibited due to poor physical or mental health. To assess social ization, respondents were classified as inhibited socially if they reported 14 or more days of limited activities due to health, within the 30 days prior. Arizonans surveyed reported a similar frequency of inhibited socialization when compared to the natio nal median (see Figure A). Figure A: Arizona and National 2011-2015 BRFSS prevalence of reporting inhibited socialization 14 days within the p ast 30- days.

Primary prevention consists of practices aimed at preventing diseases from ever occurring. Vaccination is an example of primary prevention. Secondary prevention is used after the pers on develops a disease but before they exhibit symptoms. Cancer screening is considered secondary prevention. Lastly, tertiary prevention is targeted at individuals who already have symptoms of a disease. Administration of antibiotics is an example of terti ary prevention. This section of the 201 5 BRFSS Annual Report focuses on primary and secondary prevention, including an analysis of the following: Routine Medical Examination (variable CHECKUP1) \u2014 A medical examinations within a year is considered a positiv e outcome and medical examination over is considered a negative outcome. [A routine checkup is a general physical exam, not an exam for a specific injury, illness, or condition.] Annual Influenza Vaccine (variable _FLSHOT6 & FLUSHOT6) \u2014Individuals 65 and o lder where influenza vaccinations within the last 12 months is considered a positive outcome. Individuals exceeding 12 months are considered a negativeoutcome. Pre-conception Health - Women's reproductive ages should receive preconception care to better manage their condition. o Pre-c onception Health -(variable AZ 5_1 through AZ5_7 ) Women (childbearing age) who talk to a health care professional about ways to prepare for a healthy baby is considered to be a positive outcome. 18Survey Question: About how long has it been since you last visited a doctor for a routine checkup? Preventive Hea lth Practices: Routine Medical Examinations Regular medical exams are a valuable tool in preventive care. Routine examinations can find problems early, when treatment is more effective. 14 However, there is a growing discussion on what tests to inclu de and how often an examination is necessary. Depending on age and gender, the recommended frequency ranges from 1 -5 years for healthy individuals. 15 If a person suffers from a serious medical condition, it is advised that he/she see a medical professional regularly. 16 To assess the utilization of health services, the shortest interval recommended for a routine medical examination (1 year) was used. Arizonans surveyed from 2011 through 2015 reported having a routine medical exam in the past year was lower than the U.S. median (see Figure A). Figure A: Arizona and national BRFSS 2015 respondents who have had a routine medical exam within a 12- month period. In 2015, 66.8% of Arizonans surveyed reported they had a routine medical examination in the past year. The national prevalence is 70.2 %. When looking at all the states in the nation, Arizona falls in the s econd lowest class (see Figure B).

Preventive Health Practices: Influenza Vaccination Since 1918, there have been four influenza (flu) pandemics; the most recent was the 2009 -2010 H1N1 pandemic. The CDC estimated that between 43 million to 89 million people contracted H1N1 during the 2009/2010 pandemic. 18 An analysis comparing the cost effectiveness of vaccination versus antiviral treatment of the flu found that antiviral treatment was the most consistently cost -effective treatment for working adults. However, the analy sis did not take into consideration flu pandemics, herd immunity or the possibility of drug resistant strains of the flu. 19 When H1N1 was discovered, it was resistant to two of the four available antivirals; at the end of the pandemic, \" evolved strains were found that were resistant to three antivirals. \" 20 For this reason, the CDC recommends annual flu vaccinations. The 2015 -2016 flu season started a little later than the previous three flu seasons. H3N2 viruses predominated early in the season, while H1N1 vi ruses were the most common later in the season and predomina ted for the entire season. While there were reports of severe flu illnesses and deaths, the season overall was milder than the three prior seasons. 21 In 2015, 33.8 % of Arizonans surveyed reported having a flu vaccine in the last year, which was lower than the national median (42.0%) (see Figure A).

Du e to the potential co-occurrence of the flu and pneumonia, infection in high -risk populations is of greater concern. Monitoring vaccination prevalence of individuals who are over the age of 6 -months and those who are 65 and older is recommended. I n 2015, more than one -half (52.7%) of Arizonans over the age of 65 years surveyed in 2015 BRFSS reported having a flu vaccine within the past year, levels similar to the national median (see Figure B).

Preventive Health Practices : Preconception Health Preconception health refers to the health of women and men before and between pregnancies and focuses on improving one's health before becoming pregnant in the hopes of improvi ng future pregnancy and birth outcomes in the future, resulting in healthier infants and children. 22 Since preconception health is about getting and staying healthy overall throughout the lifespan, all women and men can benefit from improving their preco nception health, regardless of whether they plan to have a baby. Preconception health encompasses multiple areas of health, including reproductive health, nutrition and physical activity, tobacco use, substance abuse and learning to manage chronic conditio ns. 23 Preconception health not only improves the lives of individuals, but it also leads to healthier communities as a whole . In addition, while no one expects an unplanned pregnancy, the reality is that it happens frequently. About half of all pregnancie s in the United States are unintended ,24 making preconception health even more important to ensure optimal health before pregnancy and safeguarding babies' future health. In 2013, the BRFSS survey asked respondents if a doctor, nurse or other health care worker had ever talked with them about ways to prepare for a healthy pregnancy and baby. The percentage of Arizonans surveyed indicating they had been asked was 44.0 % in 2015 , with numbers trending back up since the drop in 201 4 (see Figure A).

Unintended pregnancy in the United States: incidence and disparities, 2006. Contraception 2011;84:478- 85. Recognizing the importance of preconception health, since 2006, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have recommended that preconception health and care be incorporated into routine primary care visits.25 While all women and men of reproductive age should receive preconception care, it is particularly important for women with chronic diseases.26 Chronic diseases before and during pregnancy, such as diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol and mental health conditions, have been associated with increased risk of adverse birth outcomes, such as pre -term bi rth, low birth weight, birth defects and even infant mortality.27 During preconception health counseling, women can discuss with their health professionals ways to better manage their conditions, increase co mpliance with treatment and alter treatment plans if necessary (see Figure B).

The data are reported by age categories, marital status, educational attainment, employment status, income, and race/ethnicity. 25As of the writing of this report in early 2014, the United States ha d entered a new healthcare model with the implementation of Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). Under the ACA, Medicaid coverage was expanded to include individuals/households with incomes less than the 133% of the federal poverty level. Furthermore, refundable tax credits will be available to all Americans with incomes between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty line. Continued monitoring of barriers t o healthcare will provide the feedback needed to assess Arizona's efforts to provide services and care to its population. On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act and set into place an effort that will help ensure Americans have secure, stable, afforda ble health insurance. As part of the law the Centers for Consumer Information & Insurance Oversight (CCIO) within the division of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and part of the Department of Health & Human Services (DHH S) provides national leadership in setting and enforcing standards for health insurance that promote fair and reasonable practices to ensure that affordable, quality health coverage is available to all Americans. People with low and middle incomes are eligible for tax subsidies that will help them buy coverage from state health insurance exchanges. The Affordable Care Act also broadens Medicaid eligibility in many states including Arizona to generally include individuals with income below 133% of the Federal poverty l ine ($14,400 for an individual and $29,300 for a family of four ), including single adults without childre n who were previously not generally eligible for Medicaid. Persons living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who meet this income threshold no lo nger have to wait for an AIDS diagnosis in order to become eligible for Medicaid. The ACA also helps people with public or private coverage have access to the information they need to get the best quality care. 28 This section of the 2015 BRFSS Annual Report will include analysis of the following: P ( variable calculated from INCOME2, NUMMEN , and CHILDREN) - binary variable where househol d s ize and income are used to calculate 133% of the federal poverty line. H ealthcare Insurance status (variable calculated from HLTHPLN1) - binary variable where having insurance is considered a positive outcom e and not having insurance is considered a negative outcome. C annot Afford Needed Healthcare (variable MEDCOST) - binary variable where being able to afford needed healthcare is a positive outcome and being able to not afford needed health care is conside red a negative outcome. o U sual Source of Healthcare (variable calculated from PERSDOC2) - binary variable in which having a usual health care provider is considered a positive outcome and not having a usual health care provider is considered a negative outcome.Certain activities or behaviors increase the risk of mortality and morbidity. Promotion of cessation programs, awareness, and policy changes will help reduce the impact of these behaviors. Many programs and policies have been enacted to reduce the burdens associated with participating in these risky behaviors. Continued monitoring of these behaviors will provide Arizona with a tool to assess the impact of these programs and policies. 28 Web. 14 January 2014 http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/policies_Affordable_Care_Act_English.pdf Barriers to Health Care 26Barriers to Healthcare: Poverty Globally , there are appr oximately 1.2 billion people living in extreme poverty (less than a dollar a day).29 It is very rare to find extreme poverty in the U.S.; however, poverty does exist. Poverty in the U.S. is based on income and the size of the household. Research has shown that individuals who live in poverty have worse health outcomes. The U.S. Census Bureau sets the federal poverty limit (FPL) using annual hous ehold income data and household size.30 According to the 2015 BRFSS, 4.1% of Arizonans surveyed reported they lived with household incomes below 133% of FPL, 1.5% above the national 2015 BRFSS median. The charts that follow report respondents indicating they were at or below 133% of the FPL in each year (\"In Poverty\"). Survey respondents indicating they are in poverty have gradually declined since 2011 (see Figure A). Figure A: Arizona and National BRFSS 2011-2015 survey respondents who reported living in poverty . When looking a cross all states in the nation, Arizona is in the second -highest category for percent of impove rished respondents (see Figure B).

A numbe r of lawsuits followed, each challenging the constitutionality of parts of the ACA. The U.S. Supreme Court combined several of these cases into one. On June 28, 2012, the Supreme Court (i) upheld the part of the ACA that requires all citizens to obtain hea lth insurance or pay a penalty on taxable income, and (ii) struck down as unconstitutional the part that \"penalized\" states with loss of federal funding for Medicaid programs for not participating in the ACA, but approved the federal government providing states a choice to accept a federal grant and comply with accompanying conditions, or not participate.31 One of the key functions of the law is to expand the scope of Medicaid and the number of individuals the state must cover. In the past, Medicaid was des igned to provide assistance in obtaining medical care to pregnant women, children, needy families, the blind, the elderly and the disabled. Under the ACA, Medicaid will provide coverage to adults with an income up to 133% of the FPL. 32 Approximately one in seven (14.1%) Arizonans surveyed in 2015 reported not having health insurance, higher then national median, 10.8%. After the implementation of the ACA , data collected from 2014 through 2015 showed Arizona and National BRFSS respondents with no insurance on a gradual decline (see Figure A). F igure A: Arizona and National 2011 -2015 BRFSS respondents who reported having health insurance. When compared to other states across the nation, Arizona is in the second -highest category (11.2- 15.4%) for respondents who reported that they do not have health insurance (see Figure B). 31 32 Nat'l Fed'n of Indep.

When assessing insurance status , it is necessary to exclude the elderly from t he analysis as individuals 65 and older qualify for Medicare. Hispanics were 31.0 % of Arizona's total population (2014),33 however they comprised 59% of the Arizonans surveyed (2015) who report ed not having health insurance; thus H ispanic BRFSS respondents are disproportionately represented among all surveyed without health insurance (see Figure D).

Survey results at the national level were not adjusted or weighted to produce a national mean result. 31Survey Question: Was there a time in the past 12 mos. when you needed to se e a doctor but could not because of cost? Barriers to Health Care: Cost of Care When people lack health insurance or sufficient coverage, or their financial situation deteriorates, they may often forgo needed medical tests and therapies. Electing to decline needed medical care has many ethical and clinical implications. Often, symptoms of one disease overlap and tests are necessary to determine if a treatment is appropriate. Barriers to care associated with cost imposes ethical dilemmas on healthcare professionals: do they treat the patient's symptoms, treat at minimal or substandard care levels, or deny them care outright due to the inability to afford costs ? Patients will often request that their providers treat at minimal or substandard care because it is more affordable. By treating p atients in this way, underlying disease(s) may remain untreated; resulting in a more serious condition later.34 The inability to seek or receive appropriate medical care creates a strain on the medical system for both patients and providers. More than one i n six (15.3%) of Arizonans surveyed reported they could not afford needed medical care (see Figure A). Figure A: Arizona and National 2011- 2015 BRFSS respondents who reported that they could not afford needed medical care. When compared to the other s tates, Arizona is in the highest category (14.4- 18.7%) of respondents reporting that they could not afford needed medical care (see Figure B). Fi gure B: BRFSS 2015 Survey respondents who reported they could not afford needed health care by state (natural breaks). 34 Weiner, S. (2001), \"I Can't Afford That!\". Journal of General Internal Medicine, 16: 412 -418. doi: 10.1046/j.1525- 1497.2001.016006412.xResearch has shown that families are more likely to be unable to pay their medical bills. Families are defined as a group of two or more related individuals living in the same housing unit. Analysis of family units is important due to the shared impact of taking on financial risks. 35 Nationally, in general, as household size increases, the inability to afford needed health care also increases. Data comparing Arizona family size to national medians since 2011 are shown in (Figure C). Figure C: Ar izona and National 2015 BRFSS respondents who reported that they were unable to afford needed medical care by the number of children in the household. Household composition can also play a significant role in one's ability to afford needed medical care. B RFSS data only provides information on the gender of the guardian; therefore it is not possible to differentiate fami lial relationships. However, information on family composition can still offer insight on potential disparities. Nationally, single individ uals and traditional families were the least likely to report being unable to afford medical care. Families with a single female guardian and non - traditional structures (families units that are made up of combinations male or female adults (18 years) with or without children) were more likely to report being unable to afford medical care (Figure D).

Survey results at the national level were not adjusted or weighted to produce a national mean result. 33Barriers to Health Care: Usual Source of Health Care The Committee on Quality of Health Care in America and the Institute of Medicine recommended that health care organizations offer customization of care based on patient needs and become better able to anticipate the needs of the patient rather than reacting to medical events. 36 To do this, health care professionals and patients must build a long term and trusting relationship, ideally with a primary care provider (PCP). A PCP is an individual's main health care practitioner tha t offers non - emergency care. PCPs can be doctors, physician assistants, or nurse practitioners. PCPs provide preventive care, teach and promote healthy lifestyle choices, and identify and treat com mon medical conditions. 37 Since 2011, Arizonans surveyed we re less likely to report having a usual source of health care than the national median. In 2015, just 73.2% of Arizonans surveyed reported having a usual source of healthcare, higher than the national median of 7 2.5% (see Figure A). Figure A: Arizona an d National 2011 -2015 BRFSS respondents who reported that they had a source of health care. When compared to other states, Arizona is in the lowest category for percent of respondents who reported they have a usual source of health care (see Figure B).

Promotion of cessation programs, awareness, and policy changes will help reduce the impact of these risky behaviors. Many programs and policies have been enacted to reduce the burdens associated with participating in these risky behaviors. Continued monitoring of these behaviors will provide Arizona with a tool to assess the impact of these enacted programs and policies. The Health Risks and Behaviors Section of this annual report include an analysis of the following: Seat Belt Use (variable SEATBELT) - Always wearing a seat belt is considered a positive outcome and less frequent use is considered a negative outcome. Cigarette Smoking (variable _SMOKER3) - Formerly or never smoking are considered a positive outcome and currently smoking is considered a n egative outcome. Alcohol Abuse: Heavy Drinking (variable _RFDRHV4) - Adult men who have more than two drinks a day, and women who have more tha n one drink per day are considered a negative outcome and less frequent drinking including no drinking is considered a positive outcome. Alcohol Abuse: Binge Drinking (variable _RFBING5) - A person that has more than five drinks on at least one occasion in the past 30 days is considered a negative outcome and not engaging in this behavior is considered a positive outcome. 36Survey Question: How often do you use seat belts when you drive or ride in a car? Would you say \u2014? Health Risks & Behavio rs: Seat Belt Use Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for people between the ages of 5 and 34. It is estimated that seat belt use can reduce the number of deaths and serious injuries by 50%. 38 Biennially since 2006, the BRFSS survey contained a seat belt use question. In 201 5, the majority ( 86.2 %) of Arizonans reported that they always wear their seat belts when they drive or ride in a car, up from 201 4 (85.4%) . Arizona is slightly below the national median for 2015, 86.4% (see Figure A). Figure A: Arizona and National 2011- 2015 BRFSS respondents who reported that they always wore a seat belt when they drove or rode in a car. Seat belt use may be impacted by a state's laws. States with primary seat belts laws allow police officers to stop vehicles solely for seat belt violations. In states with secondary seat belt laws, such as Arizona, an officer must have another reason to stop the vehicle (see Figure B ). 39 38 Centers for Disease Control. \"Adult Seat Belt Use.\" CDC Vital Signs.CDC, 04 Jan. 2011.

The report was based on the available biomedical articles that related smoking and diseases. At that time there was more than 7,000 articles on the topic. The Advisory Committee's findings were that cigarette smoking is associated with a 70% higher all -cause mortality rate in men. It was a cause of lung cancer and laryngeal cancer in men and it was a probable cause of lung cancer in women. In response to the report, the U.S. Congress passed the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act of 1965 and the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969, which required health warnings on the packaging and banned broadcast a dvertising. 40 Since the 1964 report, the Surgeon General's reports have established a long list of health consequences and diseases caused by tobacco use and exposure, and many programs have been implemented to prevent use and encourage cessation. Continued monitoring of tobacco use is a core component of the BRFSS. In 2015, 14 .0% of Arizonans surveyed reported that they currently smoke, lower than the national median (17.5%) (see Figure A). Figure A: Arizona and National 2011 -2015 BRFSS respondents who reported that they were current smokers. In 2015 , the proportion of Arizonans who are never smokers was 60.9%. Current smokers and former smokers for Arizona were slightly above that of the national median (see Figure B). 40 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Figure C: BRFSS 2015 United States map of Current Smokers (natural breaks) Quitt ing smoking can be a difficult process, and an individual may quit smoking successfully for a short time and then relapse at some future point in time. Therefore, it is important to document the distribution of smoking status. The proportion of Arizonans who reported being former smokers in 201 5 was higher than the national median. Arizona is in the lowest category among U.S . states for current (9.1-14.1%) smoking percentages (see Figure C). Current research has established many more causal linkages between smoking and diseases/chronic conditions. In the 2014 Surgeon General's Advisory Committee's report on the Health Conseq uences of Smoking, the c urrent research assessed by the committee established additional diseases causally linked to smoking , including: age dysfunction, rheumatoid arthritis, immune function, colorectal cancer, and liver cancer. 41 Figure D: Diseases and Health Problems Linked to Smoking . 1 out of 3 cancer deaths could be prevented. 41 <https://www.cdc.gov/features/2014smokingreport/graphic.html > 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Former Smoker Never Smoker Current Smoker 39Arizonans Who Reported Currently Smoking Cigarettes Characteristic Percent N* Confidence Interval Lower Mean Upper Mean National 17.5% 53 Arizona 14.0% 889 12.8% 10.1% 28.0% Other 12.7% 34 7.2% 18.2% Use caution in interpreting cell sizes less than 50.

Health Risks & Behaviors: Alcohol Abuse - Heavy Drinking In adults, alcohol use can be beneficial or detrimental to health. Rese arch has shown that moderate daily consumption of alcohol in middle -aged and older adults reduces the likelihood of cardiovascular events, all- cause mortality, and helps keep cognitive function intact as a person ages. However, moderate alcohol consumption has been associated with increased risk of breast cancer, violence, drowning, and injuries from falls and motor vehicle crashes. Exceeding moderate alcohol consumption (heavy drinking) provides no health benefit and has been associate d with increased body mass index, impaired cognitive functioning (both long term and short term), liver disease, hypertension, stroke, Type 2 diabetes, injury, and violence. To reduce the risk of alcohol -related harms, the 2015- 2020 U.S. Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends that if alcohol is consumed, it should be consumed in moderation\u2014 up to one drink per day for women and two drinks per day (not an average over time) men \u2014and only by adul ts of legal drinking age. 42 Heavy drinking is defined as having more than two drinks a day for men and more than one serving a day for women. 43 In 2015, BRFSS respondents surveyed who reported being a heavy drinker in 201 5 (5.2%) is lower than the national median, 5. 9% (see Figure A).

It is the most common form of drinking in the U.S. It is estimated that 1 in 7 adults binge drink about three to four times a month. Furthermore, it is a common risk behavior among all stages of life. 44 Since 2011, Arizonans surveyed who reported any binge drinking was lower than the national median . In 2015, Arizonans reported binge drinking 14.2% (see Figure A).

Programs promoting awareness and policy changes will benefit the community as a whole. Continued monitoring of these practices will provide Arizona with a tool to assess the impact of these programs and policies. The Beneficial Health Practices Section of the 2015 Arizona BRFSS section includes an analysis of the following: Ph ysical Activity (variables _PAREC1, _PASTAE1) - coded variable measuring a person's level of participation in moderate or vidgorous activities according to established guidelines. Physical activity decreases the risk of heart attack, colon cancer, diabetes and high blood pressure and may decrease the risk of stroke. Fruit and Vegetable Consumption (variables FRUITJU1, FRUIT1, FVBEANS, FVGREEN, FVORANG, and VEGETAB1 ) - binary outcome where the variables are summed together. If their daily total is five or greater than they are considered a positiveoutcome. If their daily total is less than five, they are considered a negative outcome. 45Beneficial Health Practices: Physical Activity In the past, the BRFSS physical activity questions focused on the amount of time a person participated in moderate or vigorous activities. The new physical activity questions remove ambiguity in these categories; the new questions; they ask if the interviewee parti cipates in specific activities. According to the American College of Sports Medicine's Fitness Advisory Board, Arizona (data are based upon Maricopa and Pinal Counties) is ranked 32nd in the nation in terms of promoting physical fitness. Some areas where Arizona did well included: having a high percentage of state land designated as parkland, higher park -related expenditures per capita, and having lower smoking and heart disease mor tality.45 To further improve the health of Arizonans it is the goal of ADHS to increase physical activity throughout the state. Physical activity decreases the risk of heart attack, colon cancer, diabetes and high blood pressure, and may decrease the risk of stroke. It also helps with weight control, contributes to healthy bones, muscles and joints; reduces the incidence of falls among the elderly; helps to relieve the pain of arthritis; decreases symptoms of anxiety and depression; and can decrease the need for hospitalizations, physician visits and med ications. Moreover, physica l activity does not need to be strenuous to be beneficial.46 Regular exercise also can contribute to the functional independence of the elderly and improve the quality of life for people of all ages. 47 Figure A: Arizona and National 2011- 2015 BRFSS respond ents who reported that they met at least one physical activity guideline . *Not asked as a National question in 2014 ( state- added only question ). 45American College of Sports Medicine.

Previous edition of the Dietary Guidelines focused on indivi dual dietary components. The current Guidelines reflect the growing body of research that examines the relationship between overall eating pat - terns, health, and risk of chronic disease. The Guidelines advise that a healthy eating pattern is not a rigid prescription but an adaptable framework that provide individual the choices to enjoy foods to meet their per sonal, cultural, and traditional preferences as well as fit within their budget. One of the key recommendations from the Dietary Guidelines is to \"C onsume a healthy eating pattern that accounts for all f oods and beverages within an ap propriate calorie level.\" Specific recommendations regarding vegetables and fruits in a healthy eating pattern include: A variety of vegetables from all subgroups - dark green, red and orange, legumes (beans and peas), starches,and others Fruits, especially whole fruits Overall, adults throughout the United States do not meet intake recommendations for vegetables or fruits. For most adults, 2 1/2 to 3 cups of vege tables, with a wide variety chosen from the vegetable subgroups, is recommended and 2 cups of fruit, preferably whole fruits, is recommended. In 2015, 11.1% of Arizona BRFSS respondents consumed vegetables at least three time and fruits twice daily (see Figure A). The mean serving of fruits and vegetables consumed by Arizonans in 2015 were 1.4 and 2.2, respectively (see figure B) .

Furthermore, these conditions reduce an individual's quality of life. The benefits of programs and policies targeting these conditions will be difficult to quantify as data collection on the community's quality of life is not feasible. However, monit oring the prevalence of these diseases will provide Arizona with a tool to assess the impact of these programs and policies. The Health Conditions and Limitations Section include an analysis of the following: High Blood Pressure (variab le AZ7_1 & BPHIGH4 ) - Never receiving a diagnosis of high blood pressure is considered a positive outcome and receiving a diagnosis of high blood pressure is considered a negative outcome . Obesity (variable _BMI5CAT) - Not being obese is considered a positive outcome and being obese is considered a negative outcome. Diabetes (variable DIABETE3) - Never receiving a diagnosis of diabetes is considered a positive outcome and receiving a diagnosis of diabetes is considered a negative outcome. Special Equipment (variable USEEQUIP) - Never having a health problem or impairment that required special equipment is a positive outcome and having a health problem that required special equipment is considered a negative outcome. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) (variable CHCCOPD1) - Never receiving a diagnosis of having COPD, emphysema or chronic bronchitis is considered a positive outcome, and receiving a diagnosis of having COPD, emphysema or chr onic bronchitis is considered a negative outcome. Cardiovascula r Disease: Heart Attack (variable CVDINFR4) - Never receiving a diagnosis of a heart attack is considered a positive outcome and receiving a diagnosis of a heart attack is considered a negative outcome. Cardiovascular Disease: Angina (variable CVDCRHD4) - Never receiving a diagnosis of angina is considered a positive outcome and receiving a diagnosis of angina is considered a negative outcome. Stroke (variable CVDSTRK3) - Never receiving a diagnosis of a stroke is considered a positive outcome and receiving a diagnosis of a stroke is considered a negative outcome.Health Conditions & Limitations 52Survey Question: Have you EVER been told by a doctor, nurse or other health professional that you have high blood pressure? Health Conditions & Limitations: High Blood Pressure About 75 million American adults (29%) have high blood pressure - that's 1 of every 3 adults. Only about half (54%) of people with high blood pressure have their condition under control. Nearly 1 out of 3 American adults ha ve blood pressure numbers that are higher than normal and are considered to be pre-hypertensive. 48 High blood pressure is called the \"silent killer\" because it o ften has no warning signs or symptoms, and many people don't realize they have it.49 This is why it is important to get your blood pressure checked regularly. Measuring your blood pressure is quick and painless, and it is the only way to know whether your pressure is elevated . You can check your blood pressure at a doctor's office, at a pharmacy or at home. 50 High blood pressure costs, (includes health care s ervices, medications, to treat high blood pressure, and missed days of work) the nation over $46 billi on each year. 51 High blood pressure has been associated with smoking, obesity, lack of physical activity, too much salt in the diet overconsumption of alcohol, stress, age, genetics, thyroid disorders and chronic kidney disease. 52 In 2015, 30.8% of Arizonans surveyed reported having high blood pressure (see Figure A).

More than one -third of U.S. adults are obese. Obesity -related conditions include type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke and arthritis -related disabilities. 53 Further more, one in three cancer - related deaths can al so be attributed to obesity.54 Obesity has attained epidemic proportions in the United States more tha n doubling in the past two decades.55 To assess obesity, t he BRFSS collects data on self -reported height and weight; the formula for body mass index (BMI) is bodyweight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. BMI Categories are defined as follows: Underweight (BMI 12.0 - -24.9) More than one four (28.4%) of Arizonans surveyed in 2015 were obese, slightly below the national median (29.8%) since 2011 (see Figure A). Figure A: Arizona and National 2011- 2015 BRFSS respondents who were obese based on self -reported height and weight. Research has shown that low income households are less likely to live in communities that support healthy eating, and that stores in low-income communities are more likely to stock foods that are of lower quality, but are more filling. Furthermore, individuals from low- income households have expressed that fresh fruits and vegetables are desirable but impractical due to cost. 56 The effects 53Ogden CL, Carroll MD, Fryar CD, Flegal KM.

BRFSS data from 2000 -2010 showed that respondents in low -income households were the most likely to report being obese. Recent data since 2011 show similar patterns with highest obesity levels reported by the respondents in the lowest income g roups (less than $20,000), and the lowest levels reported in the highest income group (above $75,000) (see Figure B).

Health Conditions & Limitations: Diabetes M ore than 29.1 million American s have diabetes, and 86 million have prediabetes, a serious health condition that increases the risk of Type II diabetes and other chronic diseases.57 The 2011 national mortalit y data (the most current availa ble) shows that diabetes mellitus is the seventh leading cause of death in the U.S. Nationally, in 2014 there were 76,488 deaths associated with diabetes.58 Diabetes can cause heart disease, stroke, blindness, kid ney failure, ampu tations, pre gnancy complications, and death. Particularly at risk are the 1 out of 3 Americans unaware that they have prediabetes. The hormones which appear during pregnancy can cause glucose intolerance. This is known as gestational diabetes. It typicall y goes away after childbirth. 59 Therefore, individuals who were diagnosed with ges tational diabetes are not cate gorized as diabetics in this summary. In 2015 , one in ten (10. 1%) Arizonans surveyed reported they had a health pro fessional tell them they had diabetes (see Figure A).

In the United States there are an estimated 35 -43 million people with physical and mental disabilities.62 The National Response Framework defines special need s populations as follows: Populations whose members may have additional needs before, during and after an incident in functional areas, including but not limited to: maintaining independence, communication, transportation, supervi sion and medical care. Individua ls in need of additional response assistance may include those who have disabilities , who live in institutionalized settings , who are elderly , who are chil dren, who are from diverse cultures , who have limited English proficiency or are non -English speaking , or who are transportation -disadvantaged. 63 The proportion of Arizonans surveyed who indicated they needed special equipment for health reasons has been stable since 2011 . In 2015, 8.5% of Arizonans surveyed reported having a health problem that required special equipment ( see Figure A). Figure A: Arizona and National respondents who reported needing special equipment due to health reasons, BRFSS 2011 -2015.

Chronic Obstr uctive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is not one disease; it is an umbrella term that describes chronic lung conditions that cause pathological changes in the lungs. These changes occur in the large (cen tral) airways, the peripheral bronchioles and the lung parenchyma. These changes essentially block airflow as the individual exhales , making it increasingly difficult to breathe. These changes are progressive, they are not fully reversible, and cannot be treated w ith in haled steroids/corticostero ids (used to treat asthma). The primary treatment is the use of a bronchodilator; however, steroid inhalers can reduce COPD exacerba tions and increase quality of life. 65 COPD is predominantly associated with smoking.66 Figure A: Arizona and National 201 1-2015 BRFSS respondents who reported that they have been diagnosed with COPD, Emphysema, or Chronic Bronchitis. In 2015, Arizona BRFSS 6.4 of respondents reported that they had been told by a healthcare professional that they had COPD, emp hysema, or chronic bronchitis (See Figure A ). According to the 2015 BRFSS, Arizonans are more likely to report that they have been diagnosed with COPD when compared to the nation as a whol e. Arizona is the second -lowest (5.2-6.6) category for COPD, Emphysema or Chronic Bronchitis when compared to the Nation (see Figure B). 65 Cayley WE Jr. Use of inhaled corticosteroids to treat stable COPD.

Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease characterized by episodes or attacks of impaired breathing. Symptoms are caused by inflammation and narrowing of small airways and may include shortness of breath, coughing, wheezing, and chest pain. Disease severity ranges from mild with occa sional signs to severe with persistent symptoms that impact quality of life. However, even people with mild disease may suffer severe attacks. Common attack triggers include airway irritants (e.g. tobacco smoke and air pollution), aller gens, respiratory infections, stress, and exercise.67 Therefore, continued monitoring of asthma prevalence is of great importance. In 2015, 15.7% of Arizonans surveyed reported being diagnosed with asthma, higher than the national , 14.3% (see Figure A). Figure A: Arizona and National 2011- 2015 BRFSS respondents who reported that they have been tolwith asthma. Although, Arizona had a higher prevalence of asthma when compared to the nation, it was not the state with the highest prevalence. When comparing Arizona to all the states in the U.S. the data shows that Arizona falls into the third highest class for individuals reporting that a health care professional had told them they had asthma (see Figure B ).

Available from: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK 7232/On May 31, 2012, the U.S. President's Task Force on Enviro nmental Health Risk and Safety Risks to Children released the Coordinated Federal Action Plan to Reduce Racial and Ethnic Asthma Disparities. The document outlines the racial and socioeconomic disparities that exist in the U.S. regarding asthma burden. The disparities listed by the Task Force shows that minority children and children from impoverished families are disproportionately affected by asthma. Furthermore, minority children are less likely to be prescribed or rec eive the appropriate treatment. 68 As a follow -up to this initial work, the Asthma Disparities Workgroup released a series for recommendations to track racial disparities in childhood asthma. In the Arizona BRFSS 2015 survey, reported asthma among survey respondents was significantly lower a mong Asian and Pacific I slanders when compared to the state. Other race/ethnicity groups and risk factor groups such as pov erty were not significantly different from the state mean (see Figure C).

Health Conditions & Limitations: Cardiovascular - Angina Angina usually causes uncomfortable pressure, fullne ss, squeezing or pain in the center of the chest. Pain can also be felt in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaw, back or it may feel like indigestion. 69 Angina is not a disease, but rather a symptom of an underlying heart problem, usually coronary heart disease (CHD). CHD is a disease where plaque, a buildup of cholesterol and white blood cells, narrows and stiffens the arteries. This makes it much more likely t hat blood clots will form in a coronary artery and restrict blood f low to the heart muscle . The reducti on in oxygen- rich blood to the muscle results in angina and worst case , a heart attack. Depending on the angina type, there are many factors that can trigger angina pain and the different ways it presents. Major types of angina include: 70,71 Stable Angina /Angina Pectoris : Most common and follows a regular pattern. Pain occurs when the heart works harder than usual due to it not receiving enough blood flow. Unstable Angina: Unexpected chest pain, usually while resting. Typically results from atherosclerotic rupture causing a blood clot that blocks the flow of blood. Variant (Prinzmetal) Angina: Rare ly occurs. Often happens while at rest and r esults from a spasm in a coronary artery. Microvascular Angina: Results from vascular spasms in the smallest coronary arteries. Fi gure A: Difference between a normal artery and an artery exhibiting ather osclerosis. Angina is the result of a progressive disease and CHD is a form of atherosclerosis that affects the coronary arteries. Over time fat and cholesterol builds up o n the artery walls, forming a plaque (see Figure A). Plaque buildup can begin as early as infancy, and i t continues 69National Institutes of Health .

Heart attacks and strokes are the most severe complication. Atherosclerosis has been shown to develop in healthy individu als; however, r isk factors such as eating foods high in unhealthy cholesterol, having high blood pressure, having Type I or Type II diabetes, being overweight or obese, and eating an unhealthy diet will accelerate its ' progression. 72 In 2015, 3.8 % of Arizonans were diagnosed with angina, which was slightly lower than the national , 3.9% (see Figure B). Figure B: Arizona and National 2011- 2015 BRFSS respondents who reported a health care professional told them they had angina .

Possible Responses : Yes, No , or Not sure . C ardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States. The 2014 national vital statistics mortality data (the most current available) shows that heart disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S. There were 614,348 (23.4%) deaths related to heart disease nationwide. It is estimated that 167.0 deaths per 100,0 00 were attributed to heart disease, after adjusting for age. Acute m yocardial infarctions, also known as heart attacks, contributed to 11 4,019 deaths nationwide. 73 In 2015, 4. 3% percent of Arizonans surveyed reported that a health professional told them th ey had a heart attack that was above the national median, 4. 2% (see Figure A).

Health Conditions & Limitations: Stroke Strokes are medical emergencies that result when \"something blocks blood supply to part of the brain or when a blood vessel in the brain bursts. In either case, parts of the brain become damaged or die. A stroke can cause lasting brain damage, long - term disability or even death.\"74 Strokes are the f ifth leading cause of death in the U.S. in adults .75 The three main types of stroke are: Ischemic Stroke: an artery that supplies blood to the brain is blocked; 87 % of all strokes are ischemic.76 Hemorrhagic Stroke: an artery in the brain leaks or ruptures (breaks open) and the leaked blood puts too much pressure on brain cells, which damages them . Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) ( a warning or \"mini - stroke \"): blood flow to the brain is blocked for a short period of time (< 5 minutes)77 In BRFSS 2015, 2.9% of Ariz onans surveyed reported they had suffered from a stroke, national median 2.9% (see Figure A). Figure A: Arizona and National 2011- 2015 BRFSS respondents who reported having suffered from a stroke.

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) , published by the World Health Organization, is the standard diagnostic tool for epidemiology, health management and clinical purposes. The International Classification of Diseases Clinical Modification (ICD -CM) is the United States' clinical modification of the World Health Organization' s ICD1. The term clinical i s used to emphasize the modification's intent: to serve as a useful tool in the area of classification of morbidity data for indexing medical records, medical care review, and ambulatory and other medical care programs, as well as the basic health statistics. ICD- CM is the official system of assigning codes to diagnoses and procedures associated with hospital utilization in the United States2. In this 2015 BRFSS annual report, two versions of ICD 9th revision and the ICD -10-CM the 10th revision for which character classifications expanded to include health -related conditions and provide greater specificity. The ICD -9-CM codes refer to the time frame of January 1st 2015 through September 30th 2015 and expanded to the 5th character level. The ICD -10-CM codes refer to the time frame of October 1st 2015 through December 31st and expanded to the 6th and 7th character level. The estimated costs column in the tables is calculated with the Healthcar e Cost and Utilization Project's databases dataset for 2015. The Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP, pronounced \"H -Cup\") is a family of databases, software tools and related products developed through a Federal-State -Industry partnership and sponsored by Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ( AHRQ )3. HCUP databases are derived from administrative data and contain encounter -level, clinical and nonclinical information including all- listed diagnoses and procedures, discharge status, patient demographics, and charges for all patients, regardless of payer ( e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance, uninsured)3. 1 International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD -10-CM).(2015) Retrieved August 18, 2017 from http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd/icd10cm.htm 2 Hart, A.

The pattern, severity, and location of symptoms can vary. http://www.cdc.gov/arthritis/basics/general.htm Alcohol Consumption According to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans , moderate alcohol consumption is defined as having up to one drink per day for women and up to two drinks per day for men. This definition is referring to the amount consumed on any single day and is not intended as an average over several days. http://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/faqs.htm#whatAlcohol All-Cause Mortality All-cause mortality is a term used by epidemiologists, or disease -tracking scientists, to refer to death from any cause. Asthma The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute defines asthma as \"...a chronic in flammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role, in particular, mast cells, eosinophil, T lymphocytes, airway macro phages, neutrophils, and epithelial cells. In susceptible individuals, this inflamma tion causes recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing, parti cularly at night or in the early morning. These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment. The inflammation also causes an associat ed increase in the existing bronchial hyper -responsiveness to a variety of stimuli\" (NHLBI 2003). http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/csem/csem.asp?csem=18&po=4 Binge Drinking Respondents who reported having five or more drinks on an occasion, one or more times in the past month. Cardiovascular Disease Respondents who reported a doctor told them they had a heart attack, angina or stroke. Coronary artery disease can cause a heart attack. If you have a heart at- tack, you are more likely to survive if you know the signs and symptoms , call 9-1- 1 right away, and get to a hospital quickly. People who have had a heart attack can also reduce the risk of future heart attacks or strokes by making lifestyle changes and taking medication. http://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/ Cholesterol Awareness Cholesterol is a waxy substance that is found in the fats (lipids) in your blood. While your body needs cholesterol to continue building healthy cells, having high cholesterol can increase your risk of heart disease. http://www.mayoclinic. com/health/high -blood -cholesterol/DS00178 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System respondents who had had their blood cholesterol checked were asked about high blood cholesterol: \"Have you EVER been told by a doctor, nurse or other health professional that your blood choles terol is high?\" Responses were grouped into two categories: Yes and No. Analyses excluded respondents younger than 20 years of age and those who did not report ever having had their cholesterol checked. http://dhds.cdc.gov/guides/healthtopics/indicator?i=HighCholesterol Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary One of the most common lung diseases. There are two main forms of COPD \u2014Chronic Bronchitis Disease (COPD) (long -term cough with mucus), and emphysema (Involves the destruction of the lungs over time). Most people have a combination of the two forms. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001153/ 87Current Smoking Respondents who reported smoking at least 100 cigarettes during their lifetime and who smoke now (regularly or irregularly). Diabetes Respondents who reported a doctor them they had diabetes. Diabetes is a serious disease that affects almost every part of your body and can shorten your life. Some complications with diabetes are kidney disease, heart disease, stroke, eye disease, and having to have a leg or foot amputated. If you already have diabetes, you can still do a lot to keep from getting complications from diabetes. http://www.cdc.gov/Features/LivingWithDiabetes/ Disability Is a secondary condition and can include pain, depression, and a greater risk for certain illnesses. To be healthy, people with disabilities require health care that meets their needs as a whole person not just as a person with a disability. http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/healthyliving.html Influenza Vaccination Respondents 65 years or older who reported not receiving a flu shot in the past 12 months. Influenza illness can include any or all of these symptoms: fever, muscle aches, headache, lack of energy, dry cough, sore throat, and possibly a runny nose. http://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/diagnosis/labr olesprocedures.htm Immunization Immunizations work by stimulating the immune system, the natural disease- fighting system of the body. Fruits/Vegetables Respondents who reported that they consumed fewer than five servings of fruits and vegetables daily. To increase fruit and vegetable consumption of community members, it is important to improve access to, and increase the availability of high quality, affordable fruits and vegetables. A diet high in fruits and vegetables can reduce the risk for many leading causes of death and can play an important role in weight management. http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5935a1.htm HCUP Healthcare Cost http://hcupnet.ahrq.gov/HCUPnet.jsp?Id=6A4B1124FA223267&Form=SelQUER YTYPE&JS=Y&Action=%3E%3ENext%3E%3E&_QUERYTYPE=DxPr Heart Attack The death of heart muscle due to the loss of blood supply. The loss of bloo d sup- ply is usually caused by a complete blockage of a coronary artery, one of the arteries that supplies blood to the heart muscle. Death of the heart muscle, in turn, causes chest pain and electrical instability of the heart muscle tissue. http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3669 Health Care Coverage Respondents who reported that they did not have health care coverage. Hypertension Awareness Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, affects one out of every three American adults. But more than half don't have their blood pressure under control. Left untreated, high blood pressure raises your risk for heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, and other conditions. Prevention is your best defense, but lifestyle changes and medications can help get your blood pressure numbers to a healthy level. http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6 040a1.htm Hea vy Drinking Adult men having more than two drinks per day and adult women having more than one drink per day. Excessive drinking, either in the form of heavy drinking or binge drinking, is associated with numerous health problems, including chronic diseases such as liver cirrhosis (damage to liver cells), pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas), various cancers, including liver, mouth, throat, larynx (the voice box), esophagus, high blood pressure, and psychological disorders. Heavy drink ing can cause unintentional injuries, such as motor -vehicle traffic crashes, falls, drowning, burns, and firearm injuries. It also can cause violence, such as child maltreatment, homicide, and suicide. 88HIV/AIDS HIV is the human immunodeficiency virus. It is the virus that can lead to acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS. http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/topics/basic/index.htm Limited Activities Respondents who reported they were limited in any activities due to any impair ment or health problems. No Leisure -Time Activity Respondents who reported that they did not participate in physical activity in the past month outside of normal work -related activities. Pre-Diabetes The condition of having a hereditary tendency or high probability for developing diabetes mellitus, although neither symptoms nor test results confirms the presence of the disease. http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/prediabetes?s=t Pre-conception Health Pre-conception care and interventions are designed to reduce perinatal risk factors and, for optimal effectiveness, must be successfully implemented before the start of pregnancy. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1592248/ Respondent Arizona residents 18 years of age or older. In some cases various subset(s) of this group may be used. Seat belt Use Respondents who reported tha t they \"sometimes\", \"seldom\", or \"never\" wear seat belts when driving or riding in a car. Special Equipment Respondents reported having a health problem or impairment that required special equipment. Special needs population Populations whose members may have additional needs before, during and after an incident in functional areas, including but not limited to: maintaining inde pendence, communication, transportation, supervision and medical care. Individ uals in need of additional response assistance may include those who have disabilities; who live in institutionalized settings; who are elderly; who are chil dren; who are from diverse cultures; who have limited English proficiency or are non-English speaking; or who are transportation -disadvantaged. Stroke Stoppage of blood flow to the brain due to a sudden blockage or rupture of a blood vessel in the brain resulting in the loss of consciousness, partial loss of movement, or loss of speech. http://www.bing.com/Dictionary/search?q=define+stroke&qpvt=DEFINE+STRO KE&FORM=DTPDIA Tobac co Use Smoking causes cancer, heart disease, stroke, and lung diseases (including emphysema, bronchitis and chronic airway obstruction). For every person who dies from a smoking -related disease, 20 more people suffer with at least one serious illness from smoking. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Thus, Arizona's 2011 through 2015 data present a new baseline for Arizona BRFSS survey results. The new methodology changes will cause breaks in the BRFSS trends, but going forward, will also greatly improve the accuracy, coverage, validity, and repetitiveness of the Arizona BRFSS.
