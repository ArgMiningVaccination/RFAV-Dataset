The sustainable development Goal 13 emphasises to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. Climate change poses several threats to health of the population. The health eff ects of climate change occur either through Direct effect (changes in temperature and precipitation and occurrence of heat waves, floods, droughts, and fires etc) or Indirect effect (Ecological disruptions resulting in crop failures, shifting patterns of d iseases' vectors or displacement of populations). National Action Plan on Climate Change and Health (NAPCCH) has been drafted and it called for state specific action plans. It is true that adaptation challenges are experienced most acutely at the state le vel. The demographic, socio -economic and physiographic situations in the states determine their specific vulnerabilities towards climate change and in such circumstances, it is imperative to work on the precautionary and anticipatory measures for facing th e expected changes and adapting to the changes in the long term. The health impact of climate change is already evident in Kerala as the state experienced extreme weather events like including a massive deluge - a calamity of severe nature in 2018 and incr eased environmental temperature leading to heat related illnesses in 2019. Kerala also witnessed emergence and re -emergence of many infectious diseases including vector borne and zoonotic diseases in recent years. Due to epidemiological transition, a large proportion of population in the state is susceptible to water borne diseases like hepatitis A leading to explosive outbreaks even with mild water contamination. In Kerala, the health of human populations is sensitive to shifts in weather patterns and oth er aspects of climate change, owing to high population density, rapid urbanization, depletion of forest cover, high energy consumption, variation in food production, vector borne diseases, widespread water contamination, inadequate sewage & waste manageme nt and issues of inaccessibility to health care some marginalised population. In the view of the above requirement, Government of Kerala has been working on a strategy for action in the state in response to Climate Change and health. The State Action Pl an for Climate Change and Human Health (SAPCCHH) proposes a multi - pronged approach to address the health -related aspects of climate change. It envisioned to strengthen health of citizens of Kerala against climate sensitive illness. The goal is to reduce morbidity, mortality, injuries and health vulnerability to climate variability and extreme weathers. Objective is to build capacity of health care services against adverse impact of climate change on human health. This SAPCCHH endeavours to seek coordinatio n and synergies with other departments and initiatives like Sustainable Habitat, Agriculture, Water, Natural Ecosystems and Biodiversity to help the state to assess vulnerability in terms of geography, vector prevalence, diseases pattern, health care facil ities etc to adapt and to yield health benefits in the increasingly hot climate. The SAPCCHH opportunities also tried to leverage on the opportunities in the state like an empowered Local Self Governments implementing democratic decentralisation, Chief Minister's 'Aardram Mission' to make health institutions people's friendly and 'Haritha Keralam Mission' which aimed at integrating the components of Waste Management, Organic Farming, and Water Resources Management. 5 5 ACKNOWLEDGEMENT The guidance a nd oversigh t provided by Smt .

Climate change may negatively affect human health through a number of ways, but the commonly experienced ones are increased frequency and intensity of heat waves leading to rise in heat related illnesses and deaths, increased precipitation, floods, droughts and desertification costing lives directly . High temperature is known to increase the level of 'ground level ozone' and other 'climate altering pollutants' oth er than carbon dioxide, which further exacerbate cardio -respiratory and allergic diseases and certain cancers. Beside these, there is increase in transmission and spread of infectious diseases, c hanges in the distribution of water -borne, food borne and vec tor-borne diseases and effects on the risk of disasters and malnutrition. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) came into force on 21st March 1994. Since then many steps were initiated to reduce the effect of climate change at meetings like \"Rio Convention 1992\", Kyoto protocol 1997\", at Parties 21\". India is signatory to \" Male' Declaration\" wherein health sector has to be strengthened so as to make it climate resilient. According to Male' Declaration, it is desired that health -care facilities should be prepared & climate -resilient, particularly in promoting to encourage that these are able to withstand any climatic event, and that essential services such as water, sanitation, waste management and electricity are functional during suc h events. Further, for climate resilient, the health department has to undertake measures to initiate the greening of the health sector by adopting environment -friendly technologies, and using energy -efficient services. 7 7 Such initiatives undertaken by Gover nment of India are: a) Identification of Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change (MOEF&CC) as nodal ministry; b) Formulation of National Environmental Policy2006; c) Formulation of Prime Minister's Council on Climate Change for matters related to Climate Change. MoEFCC has developed National Action Plan on Climate Change with eight missions. Later on, four new missions (including Health Mission) were identified. The Health Mission aims to reduce climate sensitive illnesses through integration with other missions under National Action Plan for Climate Change (NAPCC) as well as through programmes run by various ministries. As a follow -up action, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) constituted a National Expert Group on Climate Change & Heal th (NEGCCH) to prepare National Action Plan on Climate Change and Human Health (NAPCCHH) and recommend strategies for indicators, mitigation, capacity building etc. National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC ) is identified as the 'technical nodal agency' by MoHFW for the proposed National Mission on Health. The Centre for Environmental and Occupational Health and Climate Change & Health (CEOH&CCH) , NCDC, Delhi, conducted four regional consultations in 2017 -18 involving all the states and Union Territories' of the country. Regional consultations aimed at sensitising states and Union Territories on reassessment of diseases' morbidity and mortality with respect to climate variability and extremes have been conduc ted. These regional consultations had participations from ministries and department of states and UTs including Senior Regional Directors, Regional Directors from Regional Office of Health & Family Welfare, State Nodal Officers, State Surveillance Officers , National Vector Borne Diseases Control Programme, Officers from Integrated Diseases Surveillance Programme, representatives from identified Centre of Excellence, representatives from Regional Centre of Meteorological Departments, Ministry of Environment Forest and Climate Change and Central Ground Water Board. Kerala - Geography and Demographics: Kerala is a small state, tucked away in the south west corner of India. The state of Kerala has an area of 38,863 sq. km. and a population of 33.38 million. It is situated between the Arabian Sea to the west and the Western Ghats to the east. Kerala's coast runs some 580 km in length, while the width varies between 35 and 120 km. The state is divided into three geographical regions - high land, midland and lowland. It is separated from the rest of the peninsula by natural geographic boundaries. There are 14 districts, 152 blocks and 1364 villages. The State 8 8 has a higher population density compared to the entire country (859 and 312 per square km respectively). Climatic conditions of Kerala The climate of Kerala is tropical monsoon with seasonally excessive rainfall and hot summer . The Western Ghats plays a major role in the climatic conditions that prevail all along the state. The year may be divided into four seasons. The period of March to the end of May is the hot season which is the summer month and is uncomfortable due to high temperature and humidity. This is followed by South West Monsoon season that continued till the beginning of October. From October t o December is the North East Monsoon season and two months, January and February, are the winter season. The climate is pleasant from September to February. The state is extremely humid due to the existence of Arabian Sea in the west of it. The annual prec ipitation varies between 100 cm (around Chinnar) to 500 cm (around Neriyamangalam), with a state average of about 300 cm. March to May is the hottest with maximum temperature reaching more than 32 C and the minimum is attained during December to January. W inds over the state are seasonal; diurnal variation is felt owing to the maritime influence. Annual relative humidity varies between 79 - 80% in the morning and 73 - 77% in the evenings . Kerala Climate Change - Vulnerabilities, Challenges and Opportunities Kerala is a vulnerable state because of its geographic location, population density, rapid urbanization, high proportion of population who utilize equipments with high carbon emission , increased vehicle densityand problems related to waste management. Due to the fragile environmental conditions, Kerala had to face Tsunami in 2004 followed by disastrous flood events in 2018 and 2019 during which a million people were affected. . Extreme weather events including floods and unprecedented increase in tempe rature poses different sets of challenges to the state. Challenges faced by the State Kerala is witnessing an increasing burden of communicable and non -communicable diseases. Although the State has been successful in controlling a number of communicable di seases earlier, the emergence of chikungunya, leptospirosis, hepatitis and H1N1 in recent years has led to considerable morbidity and mortality. Instances of vector borne diseases like dengue, malaria, Japanese encephalitis, scrub typhus etc. have seen a m arked increase in many 9 9 Districts. Water borne infections like different kinds of diarrhoeal diseases, typhoid and hepatitis are showing persistence in many Districts. Cholera has surfaced in many Districts after few years of relative low incidence. Incide nce of Malaria is strongly affected by climate change. Dengue prevalence is expanding rapidly. Transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, dengue is a fast growing challenge, particularly in coastal areas of Kerala in recent years. Female Aedes aegypti mosquito, vect or of dengue, Chikungunia and Zika are highly sensitive to climate conditions. Any disease caused, transmitted or harboured by insects, snails and other cold - blooded animals can be affected by a changing climate e.g. , Lyme disease and tick -borne Encephalit is, Salmonella and other food borne infections. When infectious diseases appear in new locations, where people do not have immunity and health services may not have experience in controlling or treating infections, the effects can be dramatic. Also, a chan ge in patterns of infectious disease with reference to the climatic factors is expected in coming years in the state. Also , geographically people living in coastal regions, water logged areas, and hilly areas are all particularly vulnerable in different wa ys. In the state lack of access to clean water supply and sanitation, along with poor hygiene is already the main contributor to the burden of diarrhoeal disease. Kerala -Health and Vulnerability Assessment Health and vulnerability assessment was published in 2017 . This report focuses on the health impact of climate change that are relevant for Kerala, assessing the vulnerability of health issues to this impact, and providing insights into building health sector -specific adaptive capacity. The impact of cli mate change on health are detailed and analysed at various levels, in relation to an increased frequency and/or intensity of extreme weather events, as well as those due to a progressive increase in temperatures. This report has primarily made use of indic ative evidence rather than assertive evidence, due to the nature of the available data. The methodology aims at validating an association between climate change and health outcomes by means of analysing: 1) Seasonality and vulnerability pattern of diseases 2) Changing vulnerability to specific diseases across regions and 3) Correlation of health data with climate indices It also assesses the various health programmes and their potential to serve as adaptation measures. Temporal and spatial analysis of health and weather parameters, over 2004 -'14, as well as multivariate analysis controlling for other pertinent factors shows that by and large c limate indicators are yet to show a significant association with hospitalisation cases for several climate -sensitive health ailments. However, there is some relationship between health parameters and climate parameters detected, such that individuals from central or southern 10 10 regions of Kerala have higher chances of hospitalisation due to fever and infections than compared to those from northern region. Cases of fever and infection related hospitalisation is likely to be higher in regions with greater rainfall and greater difference between daily maximum and minimum temperatures, though the effects are not statistically signifi cant. The seasonality and regional distribution of ailments was also examined, using datasets on diseases across districts over a period of about 15 years. Diseases such as Leptospirosis, Dengue, Malaria, Chikungunya, Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, and typhoid all demonstrated some correlation with temperature, relative humidity, or rainfall (see table below). While the changing seasonality pattern of diseases is very much in place, it can at the most be said to be indicative when associated with weather patter ns across regions within the state. Furthermore, it is observed that there is a shift in vulnerability to certain specific diseases like that of vector borne diseases like dengue, chikungunya and malaria which are globally considered to be climate -sensitiv e. Thirdly, this report examines the relationship between climate factors and no n-communicable diseases, given the importance of Non -Communicable Diseases (NCD) in the state. This is based on a select set of studies with varying time duration to observe th e changing intensity of NCDs beyond its response to age profile, life style factors, etc. Owing to limited exploration of this association with available time series data, this analysis was complemented with a select set of case studies on a few vulnerable individuals which provide anecdotal evidences on the impact of climate change in health and how people adapt. It was observed that climate and its variations do have an effect on the work and health of construction workers, in particular, and that they d o have certain adaptation mechanisms of their own. Although such an observation can be treated as an isolated instance, more research with larger samples may further bring out the challenges faced by such workers and those in other occupations. Opportunities In Kerala, climate change has become an agenda for development planning in recent years. The Environment and Climate Change Department, Government of Kerala has been identified as the nodal agency for coordinating activities related to climate change in the state. An outlay of 1.30 crores is proposed for initiating various activities in the area of climate change during 2012 -13. The components of the scheme include the preparation of position papers on climate change through resource ins titutions and consultants, preparation of consultancy reports on carbon credits, initiating study reports, preparation of climate change action plan for the state and for organizing a workshop on climate change. In line with the concept of sustainable habitats, works is in progress for adopting the provisions of the Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC) 2007, suitable for the state. Energy Management Centre (EMC) is pursing the National Mission on Energy efficiency in the state. Department of Environment and Climate Change is organizing capacity building activities with EMC for adopting the ECCB 11 11 Local Self Government in Kerala is quite aware about the imperative of scientific waste management in the urban civic management. Many of the village habitation s are also highly urbanized. Waste minimization and treatment of municipal waste is a priority and Kerala Suchitwa Mission is providing technical back up to the local self -government for attaining scientific waste management capability. Kerala Institute of Local Administration (KILA) gives the sensitizing programme on climate change challenges to the Panchayat Raj Institution Members (PRIs) with the support of UNDP Kerala has initiated plan programmes on Eco restoration of wetlands and river action plan for identifying vulnerabilities and designing interventions for conservation of its water resources. Programmes and Policies related to climate change and health Any decisions that affect climate change also have direct implications for human health . Hence, Kerala state requires a robust system with recommendations overarching between the climate change and existing health policies and surveillance plans. Various programmes that could be collaborated are; 1. Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme(IDS P) the integrated disease surveillance Programme is implemented in Kerala. Syndromic disease surveillance data collected from the field level (in S form) and health institution level data based on the presumptive diagnosis (P form) and Laboratory confirmed case (L form based) data are collected and analysed at the district level and forwarded to the state level and from there to the national level. Based on the disease surveillance data appropriate actions for the control of communicable diseases are taken at each level. 2.State - Prevention of Epidemics and Infectious Diseases Cell (State PEID CELL) cell was established by Government of Kerala in 1982 in Medical College Hospital Thiruvananthapuram with a view to strengthen the surveillance system in the stat e. 3. Action Plan form Clean Kerala Mission is being launched for environmental cleanliness, maintenance of public hygiene and prevention of diseases. It is significant that this Mission is being put into action after the State has made efforts to create awareness and to mobilize public opinion on the issue. Vector borne diseases Malaria, Filariasis, Dengue, Kala -Azar, Japanese encephalitis, Chikungunya etc have brought into the umbrella of National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP). A syste m of disease surveillance at the field level and health institution level, laboratory surveillance, case management and control measures of these diseases are being implemented as per the national programme guideline of these diseases in the state. 12 12 Vector Surveillance: Surveillance of the mosquitoes is done at the field level by the field staff. From the district level District Vector Control Units headed by the biologist / senior biologist do the vector surveys at areas with high vector density and execut e appropriate vector control measures on coordination with the staff of the peripheral institutions. Water quality monitoring : Occasional water quality monitoring especially at diarrhoea and other waterborne disease prone areas in the pre -monsoons season is also done by the health department and appropriate actions are being taken periodically. Ward level health & Sanitation Committees and prevention of communicable diseases: Formation of the ward level health and Sanitation committees under the leadership of the elected, Ward member, with the filed Health staff as the convener, is one of the new initiatives under this scheme. In Kerala Ward level committees have been formed in all the rural and urban wards, with the related departmental representatives of the social welfare (Anganwadi worker), Kudumbasree health volunteers, MahilaSwasthya Sangam (MSS) volunteers, ASHA worker school teachers and other NGOs' are involved in the p ublic health work in the area. Aardram Mission: Mission AARDRAM aims at creating \"People Friendly\" Health Delivery System in the state. The approach will be need based and aims at treating every patient with 'dignity'. Through the state-of-the-art investigation and intervention protocols it envisages transforming all Primary Health Centres into Family Health Centres as a first level Health delivery point. The mission envisages ensuring quality care at Primary Health Centres. All high footfall hospi tals will be transformed to patient friendly Out Patient service providers. The services include web-based appointment system, virtual queues, patient reception at registration centres, waiting rooms with Wi -Fi facilities and so on. Haritha Keralam Missio n: Haritha Keralam is an Umbrella Mission integrating the components of Waste Management, Organic Farming, Water Resources Management. It has an ambitious outlook to address the issues of piling waste, impending drought and health hazards due to the consum ption of pesticide treated vegetables and in general, the agricultural dependency of the State. The Haritha Keralam Mission aims to integrate the 3 most important and inter -related sectors through an orchestrated and cascading implementation of three Sub - Missions. 13 13 Household level segregation and safe disposal of organic waste through feasible options like composting, biogas, arrangements for institutional waste disposal, re -use, recycling and safe disposal of non -degradable and electronic waste are given p riorities. Local administrative bodies has initiatives for the effective collection, segregation, cleaning, storage and recycle of the non -degradable plastic waste. Rejuvenation of tanks, ponds, streams and rivers are the focus in the water resource secto r. The thrust in promoting organic agriculture will be to produce safe to eat vegetables and fruits to make the state self -sufficient within the next 5 years. There are several important institutions in the state under the aegis of Kerala State Council for Science and Technology, working on the various aspects of climate change. Centre for Earth Science Studies, Centre for Water Resource Development and Management, Kerala Forest Research Institute, National Transportation Planning and Research Centre ar e some of the institute especially equipped for the relevant work . 14 14 CHAPTER 2 CLIMATE RESILIENT HEALTH SYSTEM Climate Change vs. Health Resilience: 'Resilience' may be defined as the \"capacity of a social -ecological system to cope with a hazardous event or disturbance, responding or reorganizing in ways that maintain its essential function, identity, and structure, while also maintaining the capacity for adaptation, learning and transformation.\" Accordingly, a climate resilient health system may be defined as the one that is capable to anticipate, respond to, cope with, recover from and adapt to climate -related shocks and stress, so as to bring sustain ed improvements in population hea lth, despite an unstable climate. (WHO,2015) To achieve climate resilient health system and healthcare facility World Health Organization has prioritized six common \"building blocks\" that are necessary to support the delivery of Universal Health Coverage and improved outcomes. They are: a) Leadership and governance; b) Health workforce; c) Health information systems which include (Vulnerability, Capacity and Adaptation Assessment, Integrated Risk Monitoring and Early Warning, Health and climate Research): d) Essential medical products and technologies (Climate resilient & sustainable technologies and infrastructure); e) Service delivery (Emergency Preparedness and Management, Climate Informed Health Programs, Management of Environmental determinants of Health); and f) Financing (Climate and Health Financing) Figure 2.1: Components comprising the WHO operational framework for building cli mate resilient health systems, and the main connections to the building blocks of health systems 15 15 Leadership and Governance The government should take specific responsibility and accountability on climate change and health. There should be specific prog rams and of action and budget allocated. Cross -sectoral collaboration should be strengthened and synergies maximized to ensure that decisions taken in other sectors protect and promote health (World Health Organization (WHO ,2015) . Health Workforce Human Resource It mainly refers to strengthening of technical and professional capacity of health personnel, the organizational capacity of health systems, and their institutional capacity to work with others. It can be achieved by conducting training courses on climate change and health t opics targeting health personnel. Hospital staff should be aware of the fact that hospital -based healthcare generates large quantities of greenhouse gas emissions. All medical and paramedical staff should be sensitized and have to accept responsibility for taking action to mitigate climate change. Organizational capacity development To develop organizational capacity development there should be contingency plans for the deployment of sufficient health personnel in case of acute shocks, such as extreme weat her events and outbreaks developed at the relevant level (i.e. national, provincial, local). Hospitals should have realistic and innovative capacity -building plans (e.g. from capacity or vulnerability and adaptation assessments), developed to address ident ified human resources and institutional capacity gaps. Contingencies, adaptation costs and potential losses and damages from climate change should be incorporated by management staff into investment plans (World Health Organization (WHO)., 2015) . Communications and awareness raising To have communications and awareness raising, health system should develop and implement an internal and external communication plans (including the development of knowledge products) to raise awareness of health and climate change and response options ta rgeting key audiences, such as health professionals and decision -makers, communities, the media and other sectors. Health professionals, the media and community leaders should be trained in risk communication, including communication of uncertainty. Hospi tals have a major opportunity to influence public perception of the importance of environmental sustainability. Making a clear public commitment to environmental sustainability as a guiding principle in hospital design, purchasing policy, and in the design of care pathways sends a very clear message to employees, patients and visitors that the health system considers climate change a real threat, and one that we can all do something about (Tomson, 2015). Health information systems Climate vulnerability and adaptation (V&A) assessments of health centres in the state Climate vulnerability and adaptation (V&A) assessments are an essential tool for health policy and programmatic planning. Systematic assessment of climate vulnerability of health care facilities will help plan for a possible climate induced event better and ensure uninterrupted health service delivery even in the event of any adversity. Vulnerability Assessment Assessments can improve understanding of the linkages betwee n climate and health. Baseline rates, and climate sensitivity of health conditions, continuous monitoring of changing risk 16 16 conditions and health status are needed to be assessed. Most vulnerable populations and areas prone to health risks of climate change should be identified. Health impact assessments for key adaptation and mitigation policies and programs of health - determining sectors should be conducted. Capacity Assessment It includes assessment of baseline information on capacities and gaps within t he health system to face the challenges posed by climate change. It includes baselines on existing human resources, technical and health service delivery capacity established, with identification of weaknesses. Recommendations should be made for addressing gaps and building health systems capacity. Adaptation strategy Assessment results should be used to prioritize allocation of resources and effective interventions in health and related -sectors for high risk and vulnerable populations (World Health Organization (WHO)., 2015) . Integrated risk monitoring and early warning Integrated disease surveillance and early warning Early detection tools (e.g. rapid diagnostics, syndromic surveillance) should be used to identify changing incidence and early action triggered. Geographic and seaso nal distribution of health risks and outcomes (i.e. risk mapping) should be tracked. Early warning systems for relevant extreme weather events and climate -sensitive diseases (e.g. heat stress, zoonotic diseases, undernutrition) should be established. Moreo ver, continuous collaboration between the health and meteorological sectors is essential. The health sector should use current and projected climate data to inform the development of a climate and health early warning system (Rakotoarison et al., 2018). Communication There should be a community engagement and feedback mechanisms established to empower affected populations to respond to warnings, and to guide future development of monitoring and warning systems. Health and climate research Health and clima te research should have a wider focus , not just limit to studies on vector borne diseases (World Health Organization (WHO)., 2015) . Essential medical products and technologies Adaptation of current technologies and processes The healthcare facilities consume significant amounts of e nergy as compared to average commercial buildings due to increased amount of square footage of healthcare facilities as a result of population growth and the aging population. This large rate of energy consumption can be improved by instituting energy cons ervation measures (ECMs) in healthcare facility retrofit projects. From a sustainability perspective, and under the current economic conditions, it is logical to consider energy efficiency -driven retrofit strategies for healthcare facilities instea d of replacing aging healthcare facilities (Mohammadpour, Anumba and Messner, 2012) 17 17 Energy efficiency Improve energy supply and distribution efficiency:This can be achieved by fuel switching, energy recovery options, using distributed energy generation (decentralized or on -site generation) and installation of combined heat and power system. On-site renewable energy sources : Deployment of different forms of renewable energy for power generation can reduce GHG impacts. These may include installation of on -site solar photovoltaics, utilizing systems that utilize thermal energy, wind or any other form of renewable energy. Reduc ed-energy devices : In order to achieve energy and operational savings healthcare sector may also adopt using non - electric medical devices, direct current devices and energy efficient appliances. Passive cooling, heating and ventilation strategies:Such s trategies include the use of natural ventilation, evaporative cooling, desiccant dehumidification and underground earth -pipe cooling systems for healthcare settings. Promotion of new technologies Climate Friendly Hospital Construction Green hospital can be defined in a number of ways. Office of the Federal Environmental Executive defines a green or sustainable building as \"the practice of increasing the efficiency with which buildings and their sites use energy, water, and materials, and reducing building impacts on human health and the environment, through better siting, design, construction, operation, maintenance, and removal \u2014the complete building life cycle\"(Howard JL.Office of Federal Environmental Executive (US), 2003) According to Indian Green Buil ding Council, a green hospital building can be defined as one which enhances patient wellbeing, aids the curative process, while utilizing natural resources in an efficient, environment -friendly manner (Srinivas S., 2016) Healthcare facilities can become environmentally sustainable by siting hospitals near public transportation routes, using local and regional building materials, planting trees on the site, and by incorporating design components like day lighting, natural ventilation, alternative energy, water harvesting and green roofs (Dhillon and Kaur, 2015) Climate Friendly Health Care Transportation Staff travel contributes significantly to the carbon footprint of healthcare. Hospitals should encourage active transport (walking or cycling) by collabo rating with local authorities on suitable routes and by provision of secure cycle storage and shower/changing facilities; use of public transport (by collaboration with local providers); and car -sharing schemes or RE powered transport. For those staff for whom car transport remains necessary, reimbursement and parking provision should incentivize use of low -carbon options such as electric or hybrid cars. This can reduce risks of traffic related injury, hypertension, cardiac disease and diabetes for the heal thcare workers. Wherever possible, travel should be avoided, by better use of virtual meetings using teleconference, videoconference and web -enabled meeting facilities (Tomson, 2015). Telemedicine Telemedicine could reduce the carbon footprint of healthca re. Particularly for patients with chronic disease who already know the doctor phoning them (for instance, kidney transplant 18 18 recipients, the benefits far outweigh the risks (Tomson, 2015). So, it is very important to use new technologies such as eHealth or satellite imagery to improve health system performance. Sustainability of health operations Reduction in pharmaceutical use Reducing waste associated with medications that are sent to the ward but not used before their expiry date. Using the patient's own drugs during inpatient episodes. Shared decision -making: ensuring that patients share in the decision to take a particular treatment before prescribing and dispensing it. Using 'starter packs' for new medication, so that only a short supply of treatment is wasted if the patient doesn't tolerate it Carrying out regular medication reviews (Tomson, 2015) Sustainable procurement The health system has huge purchasing power. They have the power to influence their suppliers to ensure that these goods and services are produced in an environmentally sustainable way. Sustainability in selection of products and procurement of services including energy, water, transport and waste management should be assessed and prioritized by health facilities. Adopting a policy of purchasing food from local suppliers reduces the carbon footprint associated with transport of food and supports the local economy. Similar advantages apply to the local purchase of many other consumables including office equipment (Tomson, 2015) . Waste reduction Hospital care produces large amounts of waste, with operating theatres contributing a large proportion. Disposa l of 'biohazard' waste requires high -energy disposal processes, including incineration: putting potentially recyclable waste into a 'biohazard' container is therefore doubly wasteful. However, waste reduction is about much more than recycling. Each special ty has its own carbon footprint, and its own opportunities to save money and carbon (Tomson, 2015). There should be more focus on non -incineration method of hospital waste disposal. According to The World Health Organization in a 2004 policy paper entitled \"Health -care Waste Management\" stated that \"effective, scaled up promotion of non -incineration technologies for the final disposal of health -care wastes to prevent the disease burden from (a) unsafe health -care waste management and (b) exposure to dioxins and furans\" should be a priority for developing countries. It includes The four basic processes are: Low -heat thermal processes, Chemical processes, Irradiative processes, Biological processes (World Health Organiztion, 2014) Conserve and maintain water resources Healthcare facilities should take measures to manage w ater leakages, install water efficient fixtures, install onsite water treatment systems, undertake water recycling, storage and harvesting methods, within the institute premises. These would better ensure water security, save water fees, reduce energy use for water extraction from surface/ aquifer sources and associated truck transit. 19 19 Service delivery Management of environmental determinants of health Climate change threatens health through environmental determinants, strongly mediated by social conditions. There should be more focus in scaling up multi sectoral public health prevention programmes that can avoid negative health outcomes at their source and facilitate timely and increasingly effective responses to changing environmental and climate related risk conditions. There should be health -related policies and programmes in sectors, such as agriculture, transport, housing and energy can lead to redu ced health risks and improved health practices, behaviors and processes. Health sector can play role in providing evidence and raising awareness, joint monitoring of environmental exposures and outcomes, defining regulatory standards and management of heal th risks. Climate -informed health programmes Health programming Health programming and operations should increasingly be designed and implemented taking into account both current climate variability and projected future climate change. Medium - and long-term plans for disease control programmes should be revised consider capacities that may be stressed or exceeded by climate change. Investment plans should be defined to address identified capacity gaps. Delivery of interventions Risk maps and analysis of s easonal trends in diseases has to target resources and preventive measures for those most at risk. Contingency plans for healthcare should have provision in extreme weather events, or delivery of interventions to control outbreaks of infectious disease in new locations developed and tested (World Health Organization (WHO)., 2015) . Patient Empowerment Improving the 'empowerment' of patients with chronic conditions The majority of hospital inpatients are patients with multiple chronic conditions. Interventions that improve patient's involvement and understanding of their own management can result in better outcomes - including lower utilization of hospital care and lower uptake of 'preference - sensitive' options. These findings put actions to improve patient engagement high on the agen da - both for the financial sustainability of the hospital and for its environmental sustainability (Tomson, 2015). Improving end of life care Improving end -of-life care by working more closely with hospices and social care agencies would therefore improv e not only quality of death but also financial and environmental sustainability. Encouraging the use of advance directives by people with life -limiting chronic diseases could also help, yet the use of such directives remains the exception rather than the rule (Tomson, 2015) Strategies to overcome Food and Foodborne Diseases Food and Foodborne Disease Surveillance - Adoption of novel surveillance methods, such as syndromic methods, to speed up detection and increase the fidelity of intervention in foodborne outbreaks. There should be monitoring and response to Food and Health Hazards and Emergencies and Health Protection Including Food Safety and Others (Lake and Barker, 2018) Emergency preparedness and management Outbreaks and health emergencies triggere d by climate variability are primary concerns of 20 20 climate change. Climate -informed preparedness plans, emergency systems, and community - based disaster and emergency management are essential for building climate resilience. Health operations including health care and public health infrastructure should be increasingly prepared to address changing population catchments, service demands, increase emergency response and operate under diverse environmental conditions. Community Empowerment Empower communities to effectively prevent and respond to the health risks posed by extreme weather events. Community knowledge of local risks and vulnerable groups is essential to identify and address actual needs of the community. There should be implementation of capacity dev elopment programmes to identify and support the roles of local communities to determine risks, prevent exposure to hazards and take action to save lives in extreme weather events. (World Health Organization (WHO)., 2015) Financing Development funding in sectors influencing health Screening for climate variability, climate change risks and health protection, should be included as criteria for selecting investments in key health determining sectors, such as water and sanitation, and food and nutrition security. Health impacts of clim ate change should be monitored in programmes funded through financial mechanisms specific to health -determining sectors. (World Health Organization (WHO)., 2015) 21 21 Figure 2.2: Elements of a Resilient Healthcare System Key focus areas for the Kerala State Action Plan on Climate Change and Human Health Based on current evidence, it is anticipated that the Health Department's focus would be to build climate resilience through strategic focus on a few key aspects: 1. Build adaptive resilience and reduce vulnerability in health sector a nd across communities; 2. Build disease -specific response system to address the changing burden of disease related to climate change. For this the State will: a) Undertake reviews of the State's health infrastructure and potential climate change related vulnerabilities and risks (and where such infrastructure is found to be at high risk, retrofit to make these more climate resilient), for example prepare contingency plans for alternative methods of energy generation during electricity blackouts in health facilities; b) Set up early warning systems and emergency response to deal with climate induced extreme weather events like floods, storm surges, cyclones, heat waves, droughts etc. c) Set up systems of effective monitoring the spread of infectious diseases, h eat stress and air pollution and setting up of early warning systems and health advisories; d) Undertake measures to manage increased vector borne and water borne disease burden; e) Design and deploy improved approaches to deal with heat and wave conditions; f) Set up mechanisms to deal with the physical and psychological impacts post -extreme weather events; g) Inter sectoral collaboration in addressing floods, drought, malnutrition, and food security issues; h) Addressing food safety arising due to increased ambient temperature and extreme events; i) Create awareness in public on the health hazards from climatic change; 22 22 j) Produce Information Education and Communication and Behavioral Change Communication material on disease/ risk specific contexts like air pollution, fl oods, droughts etc; k) Build capacity among the health professionals through trainings and sensitization programs; l) All medical and paramedical staff to be sensitized and have to accept responsibility for taking action to mitigate climate change. Capacity bu ilding and training of the all- medical personnel of in districts including frontline functionaries and personnel associated with various programs such as the Integrated Disease Surveillance Program (IDSP), Sentinel Surveillance on Acute Respiratory Inciden ce (ARI) etc in the State to identify the early signs of extreme climatic effects on the population; m) Developing and strengthening of disaster management teams in every district hospital specifically to respond to the effect of extreme climate changes. Kerala Health System Kerala has attracted international attention for its outstanding achievements in population health despite its economic backwardness. This paradox, often referred to as the 'Kerala Model of Development', has become an ideal model of deve lopment for many poor income countries in the world. Many of its health indicators surpass those of other Indian states , some are even on par with developed countries. Infant Mortality Rate of Kerala is 12/1000 live births while that of India is 45/1000 li ve births. Antenatal care is 100% and institutional delivery is universal in the state. The state has the highest overall life expectancy at birth (74.9 years), lowest rates of maternal mortality (66/100,000 live births) and childhood malnutrition (23%). Key contributing factors to these outcomes are often attributed to its effective health care system, which has ensured high accessibility at low cost, and non -health sector contributions addressing social determinants of health such as widespread education , high literacy rate ( male 96.11% and female 92.07% ), social, land reforms, public distribution of food, development of road and housing conditions. Primary Health care services have been systematically organized in rural areas of the state. This ample ne twork that extends to the grass root level must have contributed to less urban - rural disparity. There are 230 community health centers and 845 primary health centers (approximately one per 30,000 populations ) in the State. There are 5500 junior public heal th nurses and 3500 Junior Health Inspectors; both being multi -purpose health workers (MPW) for a Health Sub -Centre, serving every 5000 population. Ownership of primary and secondary healthcare institutions is decentralized to Local Self Governments (LSG). Substantial budget 23 23 provision is ensured to equip the LSGs to assume these responsibilities. This democratic decentralization has led to mass participation in health care activities of the state and increased the public accountability and government steward ship of public health programs. Curative services are provided by Modern medicine, Ayurveda and Homeopathy. The private sector plays a major role in health care provision providing the majority of facilities. There are more than 300 hospital beds per 100,000 populations , which is probabl y one of the highest ratios in the developing world. Modern Medicine comprises 36.9% of total facilities and 94.2% of total beds; the public sector owns 23.3% of the facilities and 39.5% of the beds. There are 13.5 private health facilities per 100,000 pop ulation. There are 811 Ayurveda hospitals/dispensaries and 644 Homeopathy dispensaries/hospitals in Government sector. Activities undertaken and further proposed related to greening of health sector The state plan to promote green hospitals utilising natural resources in an energy efficient manner. Main focus is to reduce energy consumption and reduce CO2 emission. Optimum use of solar energy, maximising day light and optimising artificial lighting re quirement with low energy LED lighting and task lights, maximising cross ventilations, maintaining indoor gardens, safe handling and disposal of hospital wastes, waste recycling and purchasing products which are environmentally friendly and safe, incorpora ting measures in building design for making it climate resilient, promoting technologies which reduce harmful chemicals emission & carbon foot -print and more use of energy -efficient equipment and services. The plan for greening hospitals will be incorporat ed to Chief Minister's Aardram Mission to make hospitals people's friendly. Kerala State Remote Sensing and Environment Centre (KSREC) is envisaged to have a GISbased portal where spatial data can be analysed. Health Department is the first departmentin t he state to have a Disaster Management Plan. Standard operating procedure for Epidemiologyis being prepared which will be embedded into decision making processes.Epidemic preparedness planning is undertaken before start of monsoon season every yearin coope ration with Panchayat, ward level health and sanitation committees. Evidencebuilding for climate change vulnerability and communicable disease is being undertaken by asmall group of experts in the health department. Preparation of health -related vulnerabil itymap is underway which connects climate change with communicable and noncommunicable diseases. 24 24 Data is a challenge and it can be improved upon once more research and fine -tuning isconductedas data assimilation is a continuous process. A system to generat e data on GHGemissions and carbon footprint are not available in the state, though NGOs and other globalagencies are developing it. Various recommendations by SAPCC,2017 which comprehensively implicates on health care are as follows; Benchmarking of data is vital to demonstrate changes made due to climate action Traditional adaptation activities need to be brought back for building resilience. Evidence -based models built on data and case studies is needed for vulnerability assessments . The evidence need s to be taken to people for ownership and action; Good governance network is needed within the state departments. While implementing Haritha Keralam, cross -departmental integration of climate change planning and execution is required. Knowledge network is needed to draw upon experiences and knowledge from each other; 25 25 CHAPTER 3 SAPCCHH: VISION, GOAL& OBJECTIVES Vision: Strengthening of healthcare services for all the citizens of the state especially vulnerable like children, women , elderly, tribal and marginalized population against climate sensitive illnesses .

Following are the major climate sensitive diseases prevalent in Kerala. Vector Borne Diseases Water Borne Diseases Food Borne Diseases Acute Respiratory Illnesses attributed to Air Pollution Heat related illnesses Nutrition related diseases Allergic Diseases Cardio -pulmonary Diseases, Mental Health support, Zoonotic Diseases Disaster management - Extreme weather events (Floods, cyclones, drought) affecting health Fig 6.1 Trend of selected climate sensitive Communicable Diseases notified through Integrated Disease Surveillance Project 40 Dengue: Dengue fever, which surfaced in Kerala as early as 1998, has now become the single largest vector borne disease. Till 2015, the disease was more prevalent in Districts like Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Kottayam, Pathanamthitta , Kozhikode all the Districts reported Dengue in large numbers. Districts located at higher altitudes were having low prevalence, but all others showed high incidence. The main reason for this wide spread distribution is believ ed to be due to the changes in the environmental factors causing proliferation of the dengue vector -Aedes mosquitoes. These mosquitoes, which in the earlier days seen more in rural settings have now, spread to urban areas also. Leptospirosis: Leptospiros is is another emerging public health challenge faced by the State. Considered as a rare disease in the early 1980's, it has now spread to all Districts. In 2012 -13 a major epidemic of the disease occurred, affecting most of the northern Districts, followin g which the disease has become endemic in Kerala. The disease is initially a rodent borne infection, spread through urine of the infected rodents, and the consequent contamination of the environment is the factor responsible for the disease. Over the years , the disease has been reported in many domestic animals like cows, dogs, pigs etc. and thus has become an occupational risk for those engaged in agriculture works. People, who have been involved in cleaning of stagnant canals and drains, were reported to have contracted the disease. Chikungunya: Chikungunya is an emerging sickness among the vector borne infections. This disease believed to have originated in the remote islands in Arabian Sea in 2005 -06 spread rapidly over whole of Kerala within the next two years, affecting more than 80 per cent of our population. Fortunately, the disease is fading out, and has resulted in lifelong immunity for the affected population, a blessing in disguise. The past two years have seen only sporadic cases in Kerala, an nual total being less than 200 cases and no deaths. Here again the vector responsible for disease transmission is the Aedes mosquitoes. Since both dengue and chikungunya are transmitted by same mosquito, and also since the same mosquitoes are responsible f or transmission of the potential threat of Zika virus disease and Yellow fever, the State should be vigilant in future. Malaria: Though Kerala had controlled the disease in early 1970s, Malaria has now remerged as a public health challenge. The problem is recently aggravated due to the presence of large -scale population movement from malaria endemic states. Proportion of falciparum malaria, the more severe form of the disease is slowly on the rise in Kerala. Though elimination of indigenous form of Mala ria has been 41 41 included in the SDG targets by the State, the issues in its fulfilment are many. Rapid urbanisation, extensive infrastructure development in many Districts, uncontrolled construction works in urban area, and climate related changes in life cyc le of mosquitoes are all big hurdles in the attainment of the SDG goals. Annual cases of malaria in Kerala are less than 2,000 and the number of deaths reported is also very low, but the major issue here is the increase in foci of indigenous malaria. Thiru vananthapuram, Kollam, Kozhikode, Malappuram, and Kannur Districts have pockets of indigenous malaria over the past few years. Kasaragod District is persistently having high number of malaria cases , over many years, because of its proximity to the highly e ndemic Districts of Karnataka. Movement of fishermen along the western coast of our State is a potential threat for spread of malaria along the coastal Districts. Japanese Encephalitis (JE) : This is a form of encephalitis, an inflammatory disease of brain and its coverings, and is also a mosquito borne infection. Due to the presence of large paddy fields, Kerala is also at risk of this disease, as the virus responsible for the disease is spread by Culex mosquitoes , which are bred abundantly in water logged areas like paddy fields. The peculiar nature of the Culex mosquito to breed in contaminated water also, increases the potential threat in other areas as well. Role of migratory birds in transmiss ion of JE is an extra risk for Kerala, because our State has many attractive sanctuaries for migratory birds. Water Borne Diseases: There was a decrease in Acute Diarrhoeal Diseases (ADD) in 2018 compared to previous years. There was a considerable decr ease in typhoid in 2018, but death due to suspected Hepatitis increased. The main reason for waterborne diseases is attributed to the unavailability of safe drinking water in many parts of the District especially in tribal and coastal areas. Unhygienic dri nking water sources like wells, pump houses, water supplied through tanker lorry, leaks in public water supply pipes and the consequent mixing of unclean water with drinking water, dumping of wastes including sewage in water sources, use of commercial ice in preparation of cool drinks, habit of unsafe water in preparation of welcome drinks etc. are some reasons for spread of water borne diseases. 42 42 Table 6.1: Hepatitis A outbreaks reported from Kerala 2012 -2016: 84 outbreaks in 5 years Year Total Number of outbreaks reported Number of outbreaks with affected cases more than 20 Number of outbreaks with affected cases more than 50 Number of outbreaks with affected cases more than 100 2012 14 7 1 0 2013 19 12 3 0 2014 18 9 4 1 2015 20 11 3 0 2016 13 10 2 1 Fig 6.2: Emerging Infectious Diseases, Kerala Kerala has witnessed emergence of many zoonotic and infectious diseases like Nipah Virus (2018 Kozhikode & 2019 Ernakulum ), West Nile Virus (First reported in 2011 at Alapuzha), Kyasanur Forest Thrissur). Heat Related Illnesses Sun burns, Heat rashes and sun stroke were reported increasingly over last two years in Kerala. The district wise data for 2019 (till October 30th) is as shown below. 43 43 Table 6.2.

Prevalence of self -reported asthma was 2.82% and that of chronic bronchitis was 6.19% in a study which included around 12000 individuals from a rural area of Kollam district (Krishnaveni V etal .,2018) . Air Pollution The analysis of Air Quality Index values during June 2015 by Central Pollution Control Board as a part of National Ambient Air quality monitoring in 11 cities of Kerala indicates that 71% AQI values are falling in good category, 28% are in satisfactory and 01% in moderate. Health effects of Kerala Floods 2018 According to the Central Water Commission Study report on Kerala floods of August 2018, t he rainfall in Kerala during June, July and 1st to 19th of August 2018 was 15%, 18% and 164% respectively which was above normal (CWC, 2018) . Severe spell of rainfall started from the 14th of August and continued till the 19th of August. Coming on top of an already above normal rainfall which had filled all the reserve space to 44 44 store water, this led unprecede nted floods in 13 out of 14 districts of the state. National Disaster Management Authority had declared it a Level 3 Calamity, or \"calamity of a severe nature\". There were major landslides which left many hilly habitats isolated. It is estimated that 10319 houses were fully and over 100,000 partially damaged. Over 3,274 relief camps were opened to accommodate the flood victims. An estimated 1,247,496 people found shelter in these camps. Over 483 people died, and 15 are missing. There was an outbreak of lept ospirosis following the flood. Psychological distress and PTSD were observed among many. Ensuring interruption of treatment of chronic diseases was another challenge. 45 45 CHAPTER 7 HEALTH ADAPTATION PLAN FOR ACUTE RESPIRATORY ILLNESSES ATTRIBUTED TO AIR POLLUTION Air pollution is a major environmental risk to health. The formation, transport and dispersion of manyairpollutantsisdeterminedpartlybyclimateandweatherfactorssuchastemperature, humidity, wind, storms, droughts, precipitation and partly by human activities known to produce various air pollutants. It is thus logical to assume that climate change will influence the dynamics of air pollution. By reducing air pollution levels, states can reduce the burden of disease from stroke, heart disease, lung ca ncer, and both chronic and acute respiratory diseases, including asthma . Two major types of Air Pollution : 1. Ambient (Outdoor) Air Pollution 2. Household (Indoor) Air Pollution The World Health Organization (WHO) defines ambient air pollution as potentially harmful pollutants emitted by industries, households, cars, and trucks. Of all of these pollutants, fine particulate matter has the greatest effect on human health. Most fine particulat e matter comes from fuel combustion from vehicles, power plants, industry, households, or biomass burning. Indoor air pollution refers to chemical, biological and physical contamination of indoor air . According to WHO, almost three billion people worldwid e continue to depend on polluting fuels, including biomass fuels (wood, dung, and agricultural residues), kerosene and coal, for their energy needs. Cooking and heating with polluting fuels on open fires or traditional stoves results in high levels of hous ehold air pollution. Indoor smoke contains a range of health -damaging pollutants, such as small particles and carbon monoxide, and particulate pollution levels may be 20 times higher than accepted guideline values . Ambient (outdoor air pollution) in both c ities and rural areas was estimated to cause 3.7 million premature deaths worldwide in 2012. Air pollution also affects health by causing acid rain; eutrophication due to nitrogen oxides, emission in air from power plants, cars, trucks, and other sources; Haze; toxic effects on wildlife; Ozone depletion; Crop and forest damage etc. Over 4 million people die prematurely from illness attributable to the household air pollution from cooking with solid fuels. 3.8 million Premature deaths annually from non -commu nicable diseases including stroke, ischemic heart disease, chronic obstructive 46 46 pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer are attributed to exposure to household air pollution. A study of quality of air in all districts of Kerala for a period of nine years during the period 2008 -2016 by College of Agriculture, Vellayani under Kerala Agriculture University showed that Thiruvananthapuram is the most polluted city in Kerala while Idukki the least District API (Air Pollution Index) including SPM (Suspended Particulate Matter) (2008 -2010) 14. Prominent causes of Ambient Air Pollution in the state: 1. Pollution by Automobiles 2. Industrial Emission 3. Urbanisation 4. Improper collection and disposal of garbage ( Burning) 5. Tobacco smoke Prominent causes of Household Air Pollution in the state: 1. Use of biomass, kerosene as fuel for cooking 2. Burning of waste, cow dung, coal 3. Tobacco smoke 4. Outdoor air pollution that invades indoor... 5. Chemicals used in houses like floor cleaners 6. Pollen, Dust mites and pet hairs Other factors (if any) contributing to increase/ decrease of Ambient/ Household air pollution 47 47 Air Quality Index: Air Quality Index is a tool for effective communication of air quality status to people in terms, which is easy to understand. It transforms complex air quality data of various pollutants into a single number (index value), nomenclature and color . Table 7 .1 Air Quality Index (AQI) Category Good 0-50 Satisfactory 51-100 Moderately Poor 101-200 Poor 201-300 Very Poor 301- 400 Severe 401-500 Number of AQI monitoring stations within state: 1.

Actions undertaken and further proposed to reduce the burden of Air pollution in the polluted cities of the State 1. Advertisement and promotion through IEC: a. Street plays in low -income communities b. Hoardings, billboards, as and other advertisement modes 2. Medical professional training: a. Expanded training of doctors and associate staff b. Increased training of NGOs and ASHA workers 3. Access to an air -conditioned space a. Air conditioners and air purifiers can be a useful addition to daily precautions to remove particulate matter from the indoor environment. b. To effectively remove airborne particulate matter a High -Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filter with a rating of at least H13 or above is needed. c. Avoid the use of ionization filter technology as it will generate ozone and may pose additional health hazards. 4. Masks or particulate respirators a. Masks may help in special circumstances if you have to be outside for long periods. 57 57 b. Masks should be disposable, regularly changed and have a rating of at least N- 95 meaning that the mask is adequate for filtering out 95% or most of the PM 2.5 particles. 5. City planning and management: To an extent, pollution can be abated by urban design, topography, and meteorological factors, other than control of emissions. City planners can effectively plan spatial distribution of point sources of pollution, such as ind ustries, landfills, treatment plants, transportation routes , open spaces, which impact the quality of air in an urban region 6. Supply of cleaner fuels, stoves to rural areas and urban slums: There is a need to widen the access of LPG or PNG and, wherever app ropriate, smaller packaging and safe refilling options. Several government schemes designed to increase LPG/ PNG access across India have successfully enhanced the use of clean fuel. 7. Solar lighting options to rural areas and urban slums: There is need for an adequate institutional mechanisms and delivery channels for sale and after -sales service. Solar lanterns should be promoted to households in urban slums and rural un -electrified regions. 8. Complete ban on refuse burning: Ban on refuse burning needs to be strictly enforced with substantial penalties on non -adherence. State pollution control boards in collaboration with City Corporations can develop a mobile application for bringing any major refuse burning event to notice in a region . 9. Maintaining quality a nd cleanliness of roads: Re -suspended road dust is one of the significant contributors to PM10 concentrations in cities. Dust gets re -suspended in the air due to movement of vehicles. The particles re -suspended from road side are mainly coarse (>2.5mm) by nature but still can cause respiratory illnesses. 10. Dust control at construction sites: There is a boom in the construction sector in India, more specifically in urban regions in order to sustain an ever -increasing pressure of housing and commercial space. Different activities at the construction site cumulatively account for generation or re - suspension of dust. To control emissions from construction activities, wind speeds need to be reduced and moisture content can be enhanced at the construction site for reducing the possibilities of dust getting airborne 11. Vegetationoncertainpartsoftheun -stabilizedlandcanreducedustemissionsfromtheground . 12. Transportation: Use of public transportation can result in 90 -95 per cent reduction in CO, VOCs, and 50 per cent reductio n in CO2 and NOx emissions as compared to private vehicles . Non-motorized modes of transport are non -polluting modes of transport and traditionally used to have High modal shares in Indian cities, which is depleting rapidly due to lack of or poor -quality pedestrian 58 58 infrastructure, amenities, and services. The current share of walking and cycling in cities should be maintained and encouraged through physical interv ention in terms of road design and other facilities such as provision of exclusive lanes providing safe, efficient, and integrated network for NMT movement. NMT exclusive lanes should be complemented by good shade, bike parking facilities, road crossing pr iorities, etc. Cycling in cities should be encouraged through public bike sharing systems, as available in cities such as Paris, Copenhagen, Amsterdam, London, etc. Activities conducted and planned for awareness generation on the health impacts of Air pollution Public awareness needs to be enhanced through display of air quality indices and spatial air quality maps using print and electronic media. Public participation begins with informed citizens with raised awareness levels who can motivate the gover nment for vigorous implementation or adoption of mitigation strategies. Public awareness is also a key aspect of participative vigilance over emitting sources. Along with the regulatory sticks, enhanced awareness levels will build additional pressure on th e sources to limit their emissions. The Clean Air Mission should also envisage public participation, sensitization and capacity building initiatives with academic institutions and local communities. The main objectives will be to educate and empower young minds on aspects related to air pollutants, sources, emission factors, indoor air quality, reduction and control measures, etc. in relation to the existing social structure, cultural norms, economic realities and global trends of the present times, thus cr eating a multiplier effect within the peers and families 1.

Heat waves globally have created mortality and morbidity in large numbers. The Chicago heat wave of 1995 led to approximately 739 heat related deaths over a period of 5 days. More than 70,000 Europeans died as a result of the 2003 European heat wave. In June 2015 around 2000 people died in Karachi, Pakistan due to severe heat waves. The World Meteorological Organization defines a heat wave as five or more consecutive days during which the daily maximum temperature exceeds the average maximum temperature by five degrees Celsius. Different countries define heat wave differently in context of their local conditions. In India, as p er IMD classification, heat wave is considered if maximum temperature of a station reaches at least 40\u00b0C or more for plains, 37\u00b0C or more for coastal stations and at least 30\u00b0C or more for hilly regions. Following criteria are used to declare a heat wave: a) Based on Departure from Normal Heat Wave: Departure from normal is 4.5\u00b0C to 6.4\u00b0C Severe Heat Wave: Departure from normal is >6.4\u00b0C b) Based on Actual Maximum Temperature (for plains only) Heat Wave: When actual maximum temperature 45\u00b0C Severe Heat Wave: When actual maximum temperature 47\u00b0C To declare a heat wave, the above criteria should be met at least at two stations in a Meteorological sub-division for at least two consecutive days. A heat wave will be declared on the second day . The level of heat discomfort is determined by a combination of meteorological (temp, RH, wind, direct sunshine), social/cultural (clothing, occupation, accommodation) and physiological (health, fitness, age, level of acclimatization) factors. There wil l be no harm to the human body if the environmental temperature remains at 37\u00b0 C. Whenever the environmental temperature increases above 37\u00b0 C, the human body starts gaining heat from the atmosphere. If humidity is high, a person user 65 can suffer from heat stres s disorders even with the temperature at 37\u00b0C or 38\u00b0C as high humidity does not permit loss of heat from human body through perspiration. 1.2 Heat Waves in India Heat waves are more frequent over the Indo -Gangetic plains of India , occur between March to June, and in some rare cases even extend till July. According to National Disaster Management Authority Government of India , 2016, 5-6 heat wave events occur every year over the northern parts of the country on an average . The most notable amongst the recent ones 48.0\u00b0C in In recent years, heat wave casualties have increased. Abnormally high temperatures were observed during April -June during 2010 to 20 15 across the country. In India, the heat wave took 3028 lives in 1998 and more than 2,000 lives in 2002. In Odisha, heat wave caused 2042 deaths in 1998 and more than 1200 deaths in 2002 in southern India. In India heat -wave caused 22,562 deaths since 1992 to 2015 at various states. Heat wave also caused death of wildlife, birds, poultry in states and most of the zoos in India. 1.3 Heat Wave Situation in Kerala: Although Kerala might not have as high a temperature as compared to the meteorological subdiv isions from north -west and central India, the temperature is still going to be high. The possibility of heat waves occurring in some pockets remains very high. The State of Kerala is specifically vulnerable to the changing climatic dynamics owing to its lo cation along the sea coast and steep gradient along the western slopes of the Western Ghats. Though high potential growth rate of forests and perennial agriculture in Western Ghats provide high resilience against mild climatic variations, high population d ensity, especially in the coastal areas, adds to the vulnerability to the climate related problems. Unprecedented events of heat extreme conditions were reported in many parts of Kerala State during the summer months of April -May, during 2015 and 2016. The excess amount of humidity in the atmosphere intensifies the adverse effect of heat on human and animal body by slowing the natural evaporative cooling mechanism. user 66 In the first report on \"Impact of climate change in four regions of the country\" submitted to the Government of India by the Indian Network for Climate Change Assessment (INCCA), it is estimated that the temperature is likely to increase by 2\u00b0C by 2050. The minimum surface air temperature in the Western Ghats region may rise by 2\u00b0C to 4.5\u00b0C. The average temperature in the region bordering Kerala is likely to rise by 1\u00b0C to 3\u00b0C. Maximum temperature increase can be seen in the Southern and Central Districts of Kerala while most of the districts in the southern Kerala will typically observe the incr ease in the temperature 1.66\u00b0 C to 1.77\u00b0C. The State Action Plan on Climate Change (2014) has identified four districts - Alappuzha, Palakkad, Idukki and Wayanad - as climate change 'Hot Spots' in Kerala due to the high degree of vulnerability to natural hazards like flood and drought, and impact on biodiversity and human life. As predicted in the studies t he temperature has been on the rise since the past many years in Kerala as is the case with many Indian states. For example, the maximum temperature in Kozhikode was 34.5 degree Celsius in 2008 and this has gone up to 38.6 degree Celsius in 2016 The number of rainy days is likely to decrease along the entire Western Coast, including the Western Ghats. It is now established that the sea level is on the rise due to global warming and the projected Sea Level Rise (SLR) along Kerala coast on a conservative estimation is about 100 to 200 mm over the next 100 years. user 67 Table 8.1: Heat related illness district wise data from 2016 -19 (up to June) Event of heat wave conditions was not so familiar to Keralites until the pre -monsoon season of 2015. It is widely agreed that the frequency and duration of weak rainfall periods and drought condition is gradually increasing in the State. Is it a part of th e short -term climate variability or indicator of climate change is yet an unresolved scientific puzzle, but the present scenario demands much more inquisitive analysis of the data and scientific deliberation ? If not ,heat waves can become silent and invisible killer of silenced and invisible people due to severe medical consequences suffered by certain vulnerable segments of the population. Indian Meteorological Department issued heat -wave warning on 27 -04-2016 in the Sta te. This is the first time that such a warning was issued in the State.

Even maritime districts such as Alappuzha and Kozhikode experienced increase of more than 4 C ab ove long period average on 27th April. Temperature in 2016 was 2 to 3 degree Celsius higher than normal in all districts in the State. Several sunburn incidents were reported from various parts of the State in 2016. Events of sunstroke deaths were also rep orted by media; however, Directorate of Health Services has not confirmed whether these deaths were as a result of sunstroke. Instances of sunburn deaths have been reported in the years of 2007, 2009 and 2010 from Palakkad1. Heat wave preparedness among s chools ,anganwadis and health centres - A study conducted in Shornur Municipality, Palakkad District in 2016 -20172 Shornur is situated in Palakkad district which is classified as one of the climate change hot spots in Kerala. This area falls in the midland region. It consists of hilly areas, sloping areas and plain areas. Deviating from the past climatic conditions of the area during the last few years climate change impacts have been high, with shifts in the rainfall season and lesser number of rainy days with longer dry seasons. The study was based on the following parameters: a. Building - design and verandas - additions and modificat ions b. Surrounding area of buildings c. Drinking water facility d. Water availability e. Toilet facility f. Outdoor activities g. Ensuring per capita water availability, space etc. to all inmates as per national and international standards. The findings of the study are as follows: 1. More than half of the classrooms did not have cross ventilations 2. First aid facilities were found only in less than 5 % of the institutions 3. Drinking water is available but periodic water testing was not done 4. 20% of the institutions did not have water availability in toilets 5. Less than 20 square feet area /student is found in majority of schools 6. Overcrowding of classrooms and non -availability of fans was also a major concern 7. The absence of ceiling and the height of the roof was also a concern in more than 50 per cent of the institutions 1Kerala State Disaster Management Plan, 2016 2Study by Action on Climate Today user 69 1.4 Health Impacts of Rising Temperatures Globally, higher daily peak temperatures and intense heat waves have become quite frequent due to climate change. In India too, there are increased instances of heat waves which are more intense in nature with each passing year and have a devastating impact on human health thereby increasing the number of heat wave casualties. The health impacts due t o heat typically involve dehydration, heat cramps, heat exhaustion and/or heat stroke. Table 2 shows the different type of heat related illness and its clinical manifestations. user 70 Table 8.2: Types of heat related illnesses Clinical Entity Age Range Setting Cardinal Symptoms Cardinal / Important Signs Pertinent Negative findings Onsite Management of Heat Related Illness Heat rash/ prickly heat/ Miliaria All, but frequently children Hot environment; +/- insulating clothing or swaddling (wrap in tight clothes) Itchy rash with small red bumps at pores in the skin. Seen in setting of heat exposure; bumps can sometimes be filled with clear or white fluid Diffused red colour skin or vesicular rash, itching of the skin without visible eruption Not focally distributed like a contact dermatitis Wearing clean, light cotton and loose fitting clothes can prevent prickly heat from occurring. Cooling and drying the affected area Antihistamine and chlorhexidine in a light cream or lotion base. Prevention of sweat generating situations and staying in cool environment can prevent aggravation of prickly heat. Heat Oedema All Hot environment, typically with exertion, +/ - insulating clothing Heat oedema does not restrict or interfere with normal activities and resolves spontaneously in a few days or weeks. Systemic causes of oedema like congestive heart failure, renal or hepatic dysfunction and deep vein thrombosis should be ruled out in the susceptible population. Treatment consists of loosening any constricting clothing and elevating the legs. Diuretics are NOT effective and can predispose to volume depletion, electrolyte abnormalities and increased risk of heat illness. Heat tetany Can be differentiated from heat cramps by the fact that there is very little pain or cramps in the muscle. Treatment consists of removing the patient from the hot environment and controlling hyperventilation. user 71 Clinical Entity Age Range Setting Cardinal Symptoms Cardinal / Important Signs Pertinent Negative findings Onsite Management of Heat Related Illness Heat cramps All Hot environment, typically with exertion, +/ - insulating clothing Painful spasms of large and frequently used muscle groups Uncomfortable appearance, may have difficulty fully extending affected limbs/joints No contaminated wounds/tetanus exposure; no seizure activity Move to a cool place (e.g. cool shady area, air conditioned environment if feasible).

Patient is started on intravenous fluids. The Emergency Medical Technician would give constant attention to ai rway, breathing and circulation. USER 74 1.5 Management of heat stroke at health care facility3 The accurate diagnosis of heat stroke in adults' rests on correctly quantifying the core temperature. Patients with suspected heat stroke should be rapidly assessed using Advanced Trauma and Life Support (ATLS) protocols. The ir temperature assessed with rectal or oesophageal thermometers. An elevated co re temperature in the setting of CNS dysfunction should trigger a presumptive diagnosis of heat stroke, and cooling should begin immediately. \"Prompt correction of hyperthermia by immediate cooling and support of organ system function are the two main ther apeutic objectives in patients with heat stroke\"4 A lower core temperature should not rule out heat related illness as the patient body temperature might have been brought down by the first aid given during transportation. All patients should be administe red oxygen along with cooling. Patients with an altered level of consciousness, significant hypercapnia, or persistent hypoxia should be intubated and mechanically ventilated. Lowering of core body Temperature The basic premise of rapidly lowering the core temperature to about 39\u00b0C (to avoid overshooting and rebound hyperthermia) remains the primary goal. External cooling External methods include immersion and evaporative cooling. Immersion cooling Immersion in an ice bath, or cooling blankets us ed in conjunction with ice packs to the axilla, groin, neck, and head, may be the most rapid methods of cooling. Patients cooled in an ice bath frequently suffer after drop, so that their core temperature continues to decline even after they are removed fr om the bath. Ice -water immersion or an equivalent method has the advantage of rapidly reducing core body temperature. Because of its high thermal conductivity, ice water can reduce core body temperature to less than 39\u00b0C in approximately 20 -40 minutes. The disadvantages of ice -water immersion include the fact that it may be extremely uncomfortable for patients who are awake. In addition, in theory it can cause subcutaneous vasoconstriction, preventing the transfer of heat via conduction. Recent guidel ines recommend ice -water immersion as the superior method for rapidly lowering core body temperature below the critical levels normally found for those with exertional heatstroke. Evaporative cooling The patient's skin is exposed to warm air at 40\u00b0C (1 04\u00b0F) passing over the body while a mist of cool water at 15\u00b0C (59\u00b0F) speeds heat dissipation. Cooling rates with this technique have been measured at 0.31\u00b0C/minute (0.5\u00b0F/minute). The following procedure is followed: Remove all of the patient's clothing. Insert a rectal thermometer for continuous monitoring. Mist over patient constantly, using spray bottles filled with tepid (15\u00b0C) water. 3Guidelines on Prevention and Management of Heat Related Illnesses 2015 Emergency Medical Relief Directorate General of Health Services Ministry of Health and Family Welfare Nirman Bhawan, New Delhi 4Advanced Trauma Life Support student course manual, ninth edition, American college of surgeons, ACS Committee on Trauma. USER 75 Place large fans to circulate warm room air (ideally 40\u00b0C) directed at the pati ent. Evaporative and convective cooling using a combination of cool water spray with continual airflow over the body can be undertaken for classic heatstroke. Internal cooling Internal cooling methods are effective in rapidly decreasing tempera ture. Gastric, bladder, and rectal cold-water lavage can all be readily performed. Peritoneal and thoracic lavage may also be used, but are more invasive and so are used only in extreme cases. Although rarely required, cardiopulmonary bypass or plasma exch ange is also effective as a cooling method in this setting. No data exist to help practitioners determine when internal cooling methods might be superior to external ones. As such, internal cooling methods should be regarded as an approach for use when ext ernal cooling may not be feasible or is ineffective. Circulatory support is usually given with IV fluids as 0.9% Na Cl or 5% dextrose: o Avoid K+ containing fluids. o Gradually reduce concentration of Na+ if hypernatremia . o If inotropes are required, try to use those with less alphaadrenergic activity eg, dopamine. Investigations In adults, admitted to hospital, with heat stroke hepatic, renal, and clotting function should be monitored for 48 hours after admission and tre atment. The following laboratory studies need to be done: (i). Arterial blood gas testing: (ii). Blood blood cell c ount: (viii). Renal function tests (ix). other relevant tests to rule out suspected infections and non -infectious causes Complications to be kept in mind and to be on the lookout for Hyperkalaemia Hypocalcaemia. Acidosis. Rhabdomyolysis. Disseminated intravascular coagulation. Hepatic failure. Acute kidney injury. Ventricular fibrillation (often fatal). Prognosis With rapid cooling, sufficient rehydration and careful management of complications survival rates for heatstroke approach 85 -90% in most Tertiary care facilities. However, many patients experience permanent neurological impairments or death despite these efforts. Poor prognostic indicators include: USER 76 Coagulopathy. Lactic acidosis (in the absence of severe physical exertion) . Core temperature >42.2\u00b0C. Coma lasting >4 hours. Acute kidney injury. Hyperkalaemia. Very high transaminase level. Prolonged period of hyperthermia. 1.6 Vulnerability Mapping: Heat -related illness is largely preventable. Identifying the heat -vulnerability and the vulnerable groups allows public health practitioners to best prioritize actions and effectively create public health prevention measures. It will help the administratio n to allocate necessary resources and develop action plans. Identifying and exploring the attributes of demographic population groups most at -risk is a first step in developing appropriate interventions and thereafter measures to check the effectiveness of target interventions in reducing fatalities Variations in heat health can be associated with individu al attributes, community level and environmental level, socio -economic, socio -demographic and so on. Vulnerable groups include the elderly group5, infant s and children6, people with chronic diseases, people on medication, overweight, nomads, internally displaced persons, those below poverty line, slum dwellers, pregnant women, malnourished child , migrant labourers , traffic police, airport transit staff, construction workers, rickshaw drivers, street vendors, beggars, those people having low socio economic status. Location of vulnerable groups need to be identified like old age homes, destitute homes, health centres etc. Isolated members are also considered under risk. According to WHO 2008 for the identification of vulnerable groups the following risk factors can be taken into consideration are Individual, (age and sex, existing illness, use of medication, being o verweight, dehydration, reduced ability for acclimatization and pregnancy) - living environment, (housing, urban heat island effect, internal cooling capacity, air pollution and working environment and work place conditions) - social, (loneliness, lack of access to information systems and emergency services). Vulnerable conditions increase when heat waves or heat extremes coincide with religious fasting rituals and frequent power outrage. For instance, population b below poverty line and urban residents li ving in slums have fewer options available to adapt to sweltering temperatures. This increases their vulnerability to heat and results in greater adverse impacts of extreme heat on these communities. The poverty index of Kerala shows that 11.3% of populati on falls under the poverty line. Out of the 76.99 lakh households in Kerala 63.19 lakh (82.08%) live in rural areas. Ground - and satellite -based data on urban and suburban 5Basu R. High ambient temperature and mortality: a review of epidemiologic studies from 2001 to 2008.

Curr Sp orts Med Rep. 2003;2(6):320 -4 USER 77 temperatures and vegetation over a historical period can help identify temporal and geo spatial trends in heat exposure. Slum residents are more likely to be exposed to heat since they work primarily outside or in unventilated conditions, they live in homes constructed of heat -trapping materials with tin or tarpaulin roofs, and their co mmunities lack trees and shade. Factors like lack of access to clean water, poor sanitation, over -crowding, malnutrition, and a high prevalence of undiagnosed/untreated chronic medical conditions due to poor access to healthcare heighten BPL families' vuln erability to heat related stress. The public especially those who are most vulnerable to heat stress must have the information, knowledge and support for their safety and better prevention. Passing on the information where the vulnerable are and how they a re vulnerable implies more arranged knowledge desalination Identification methodology should effectively reduce the number of morbidity and mortality and implementable at local level. Development of a risk score with weighted factors suggested parameters such as age, social condition, health condition, housing condition all factors needs to be developed with regular reassessment of vulnerable groups is required 1.7 Maintenance of Data on Heat Related Deaths and Illness: Once the systems are established f or tackling a potential heat wave situation in the state, periodic revisions of these guidelines should be undertaken to strengthen the processes. The most important factor in this endeavor would be the availability of key data with respect to heat wave mo rbidities and mortalities. Thus, the maintenance of Data on Heat Related Deaths and Illness is of critical importance. As per \"Guidelines for preparation of Action Plan - Prevention and Management of Heat -Wave 2017\" issued by National Disaster Management A uthority (NDMA), New Delhi, data on age group, sex, occupation, economic status of those who died due to heat wave, place of death etc. are to be collected and furnished for proper analysis and under taking mitigation measures. Information as per Table 4 may be collected and furnished to the Department along with every joint enquiry report of heat stroke deaths. Besides, a permanent register with detailed information as per Table 5 is to be maintained both in the Tahasil Office and District Office and week ly report in the said format to be submitted to the Department every Monday by 1.00 PM. Further, data on heat related illness is needed to carry out meaningful analysis of heat related health events and undertaking appropriate measures. Information of all cases of heat related illness and deaths as per Table 4 -7 needs to be collected by the Directorate of Health Services and submitted to the Department daily ( see Annexure 2 for tables). 1.8 Proposed Institutional Mechanisms to Address Heat Wave in Kerala: Ongoing Activities of Government of Kerala: Based on long period data of recurrence, the seasonality matrix of hazardous phenomena in Kerala heat wave/sunburn/sunstroke particularly during the months of March to May7. The cut off temperatures for Heat Wav e Forecast is - 37 \u00b0C for the coastal areas 40 \u00b0C for the interior areas Every year all the District Collectors are instructed to take required precautionary measures for mitigating the heat -wave situation and the Chief Minister reviews the prepare dness activities of the 7 Kerala State Disaster Management Plan, 2016 USER 78 related departments. The IMD also provides warnings based on heat index (based on temperature and humidity).The reliability of these forecasts is up to a level of 85%. It disseminates information directly to Special Relief Commissioner (SRC) and Kerala State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA by fax along with various state agencies, Doordarshan, All India Radio (AIR) and other media houses by mails. The KSDMA is the nodal agency which is responsible for the prevention and mitigation activities. The most important work of the KSDMA is to sensitize the necessary stakeholders, engage in their capacity building in f orms of intra -departmental trainings and prepare and share the guidelines for different occupational groups, institutions, urban local bodies, PRI and civil societies. It works in tandem with the Special Relief Organization which acts as the main executing body under the leadership of the SRC during a Heat Wave condition and issues directives to all the concerned governmental and non -governmental organizations for a prompt action. Apart from this, the KSDMA also involved in establishing the Heat Wave relate d mortality tracking system and updating the data set periodically. Process of Awareness and IEC plan: The proposal is initiated from the Nodal officer Climate change through ADPH and it communicates to State Mass Media Wing which develops the prototype of IEC in consultation with ADPH. Once the prototype is approved by ADPH, funding is released either to state level or district level programme management team where printing will be done and the materials are supplied to lower levels. For media (print an d electronic), the Mass Media Wing sends the prototype to Information and Public Relations (I&PR) Department. They publish it in Newspapers and disseminate it in electronic channels. 1.9 Standard Operating Procedures: Roles and responsibilities for managing heat waves The heat action plan shall be implemented in three phases annually. Phase -I: - Pre -Heat Season (February) Pre-Heat Season is devoted to develop early warning systems, communication plan of alerts to the general public, health care professionals and voluntary groups (care givers) with emphasis on training and capacity building of these groups. Phase -II: - During the Heat Season (March to May) High alert, continuous monitoring of the situation, coordination with all the departments agencies concerned on one hand and general public & media on the other hand is the focus of this phase. Phase -III: - Post -Heat Season (June to October) In Phase - III concentration is on evaluation and updation of the plan. It is important at the end of the summer to evaluate whether the heat health action plan has worked. Continuous updation of plan is a necessity. Global climat e change is projected to further increase the frequency, intensity and duration of heat -waves and attributable deaths. Public health prevention measures need to take into consideration the additional threat from climate change and be adjusted over time.

During 2018 , Japanese Encephalitis (JE) confirmed cases were reported from two districts -Kozhikode (4) and Alappuzha ( 1) with 2 deaths from K ozhikode . Lymphatic Filariasis was endemic in 11ou t 14 districts in Kerala. Pathanamthitta, Idukki and Wayanad are the non-endemic districts. MDA had been conducted in 11 endemic districts. MDA conducted during 2017 in Palakkad district and in 5 coastal blocks including Ponnani in Malappuram district. During October 2018 MDA was conducted in Palakkad district only. After MDA , 1st& 2nd TAS conducted successfully conducted in KLM and KTM district s. It is proposed to conduct 2ndTAS in ALP using Brugia Rapid and third TAS in other districts progressing. Morbidity Management is another important activity. Kala azar is not endemic in any of the districts and only focal cases were reported from certain districts. As per Sustainable Development Goals it is targeted to eliminate Malaria, LF and Kala azar by 2020 from the state and activities for this being conducted in the state. USER 85 In Kerala Vector -borne diseases are one of the major public health threat e ach year. It is highly depended on the weather conditions. Partnerships are being strengthened for effective control among multiple departments, municipalities, and health facilities. Several steps by the health, meteorology, and planning departments are b eing planned and executed to prevent, control, and track the disease. The ecology of vectors is a complex one and the climate is a major factor that influences the disease transmission cycles and disease occurrence. Changes in rainfall, temperature and humidity can affect distribution and proliferation of vectors. Effect of variation in climate has been well established for illnesses which are spread through vectors or which are transmitted from animals to humans. The discussion focuses on the new capacities these departments have built across the country, the on -going activities and plans for moving toward cities free of vector -borne diseases.

Malaria - High rainfall, ambient temperature ( 28 degree+/ - 2), high humidity ( more than 60%), wind velocity(medium) and the ecology (closed/open ecosystem) highly related for the occurrence of malaria. \"Anophelism without malaria\"/ \"a single Anopheles mosquito can make an outbreak\". These two phrases point out the relationship with the climate for malaria. Dengue - Dengue mainly occurs during pre-monsoon and post monsoon season. During this period water collected in small containers help breeding of Aedes mosquitoes. During heavy rain fall these small containers get washed out and due to this the burden of dengue is USER 92 reduced. When the temperature becomes high the sustainability of eggs questioned. At this time if a rain is received the emergence of the dengue vector will be speeded up. Sudde n emergence reduce the size of the mosquito. When the size becomes reduced it will become more active and causes the high transmission of dengue. This was one of the reasons for very high incidence of dengue in 2017 in Kerala. Rapid urbanisation and change s in the life style also contributed distribution and transmission of dengue. Japanese encephalitis - Due to urbanisation and industrialisation, cultivation was stopped in paddy fields. This resulted in water stagnation and growth of floating aquatic weeds which increased breeding of Culex and Mansonia mosquitoes. Presence of migratory birds due to climate change is also another contributory factor. Catholic feeding habits of the people leads to establish piggeries in various parts. Kala azar - Movement of people to forests for various activities give a chance for infection. Wet climate and poor standard of living of tribal people contribute to breeding of sand flies. Likewise, the endemicity and epidemics of Filariasis, Scrub typhus, K.F.D, West Nile etc are all depended up on climate.

Periodic field inspections at different levels by Central, state, district, sub district officers. 19. Operational Research through Medical colleges, VCRC, NCDC , ICMR , ISRO etc Studies on anti -malarial Drug resistance, Insecticide susceptibility in mosquito vectors, disease and vector mapping using GIS etc will be done for evaluating progress of elimination activities. II. Elimination of Filaria Objective - To eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) as a public health problem by achieving 1. A microfil aria rate of less than 1% in all sentinel and spot check sites 2. For those who are suffering from the disease, 100% geographical coverage of minimum package of care for Morbidity Management and Disability Prevention. Activities to be conducted - 1. Mass Drug Administration (MDA) programme to be conducted in Palakkad district and Ponnani Municipality of Malappuram. From November 11thto 30th.Action plan for MDA is prepared and pre -MDA activities and MDA activities will be done. Post MDA assessment to find out drug compliance will be done. During 2020 microfilaria survey will be done in sentinel and random sites (total 8). If mf rate is less than 1% in all 8 sites, additional mf survey will be done in PKD and MPM. If in all 10 sites mf rate is less than 1 TAS will be conducted in these districts. 2. Transmission Assessment Survey (TAS) In Kerala, 1st and 2nd TAS were successfully completed in 9 district, test for B malayi is pending due to unavailability of Brugia rapid kits and it is planned in November. Third TAS was successfully conducted in Kollam and Kottayam districts. 3rdTAS to be conducted in 2 districts E rnakulam and T hrissur during February 2020, TVM KKD, KNR and KSD during 2021. 3. Post MDA surveillance to be conducted during October -November period every year in all districts where TAS is being conducted/completed 4. Morbidity management and disability prevention programme (M MDP) USER 1 0 6 The second pillar of LF elimination is ensuring availability of the \"recommended minimum package of care\" to all known cases of lymphedema, acute attacks and hydrocele patients. Management of morbidity and disability in lymphatic filariasis includes s imple hygiene measures, such as basic skin care, to prevent ADL attacks and progression of lymph oedema to elephantiasis. For management of hydrocele, hydrocelectomy is the option. Recommended minimum package of care includes management of lymphedema, trea tment of acute attacks (ADL), Prevention of acute attacks (ADL), treatment of any remaining LF infection with MDA drugs and management of / surgery for hydrocele patients. Situation analysis and disease burden assessment to be continued in all districts. HI/LHI, JHI/ JPHN, ASHA to be involved in this. The data of number of patients with lymphedema, hydrocele, number of ADL attacks treated annually, location of these patients etc found out. Based on these data, MMDP services to be planned ef fectively. Since Kollam and Kottayam districts have successfully completed 3rd TAS, a door-to-door survey has been conducted in these two districts for disease burden assessment. Other districts also have to do this. MMDP services are being made available in THQH/DH/GH/ selected CHCs - total 80 MMDP clinics are functional in the state. Training on MMDP (TOT) was given to 155 doctors and 149 Staff Nurses and the TOTs are entrusted to give training to other doctors and field staff in the respective districts. Doctors and Nurses - Manage lymphedema, ADL and its complications, perform hydrocelectomy and report. Ensure adequate infrastructure for management of lymphedema and acute attack including facilities for hydrocelectomy. ASHAs are given training to identify patients with lymphedema, demonstrate basic principles of limb hygiene, supervise and follow up patients ( home based management). Lymph oedema patients are given adequate number of Morbidity Management kits. 5. Microfilaria survey (night blood survey for detecting filarial carriers in the community) among natives and migrants being conducted by District Vector Control Units ( DVC Units) in all districts. 6. District Vector Control Unit will be involved in Vector surveillance and vector control activities a gainst all Vector borne diseases including lymphatic filariasis. Kala azar Kala -azar is not a major public health problem in Kerala. There is no endemic pocket in Kerala. However, isolated cases of Kala -azar have been reported from across the State since 2003.The disease has been reported from Thrissur, Palakkad, Malappuram, Kozhikode, Kollam, Ernakulam and Kannur districts. Though Government of India has targeted for USER 1 0 7 elimination of Kala -azar from endemic states by 2020, Kerala state was not considered for elimination, due to very low prevalence of the disease. But, in the prevailing situation it is an imperative need to take up the challenge of total elimination of the disease from Kerala. Activities 1. Strengthening surveillance Improved detection and reporting of fever of unknown origin not responding to antimalarial treatment. Identification of hot spots for active surveillance Active surveillance among the tribal population and migrant labourers from endemic states settled in the hotspot areas using RK 39 kit Case management - using Miltefosin cap/ Inj. Liposomal Amphotericin (LAMB) 2. Mapping of sand fly hot spots Sand fly Surveillance: sand fly collection, Species identification and mapping by DVCU Validation of mapping by State/district officers wi th supervisory support from Research centres like VCRC, or NCDC. 3. Integrated Vector Management Indoor Residual Spray (IRS) - using Synthetic Pyrethroids Distribution of LLIN - to households in affected area Environmental Management - Improvement of living /housing conditions like plastering of walls of houses by Local Bodies. Prevention and control of Dengue fever and Chikungunya Specific Constraints 1. Climatic and Geographical factors: These factors are suitable in Kerala for mosquito breeding. Large plantations of rubber, cocoa, pineapple, bamboo, areca nut etc are seen everywhere. Latex collection cups in rubber estates, hanging hollow cocoa fruits, pineapple leaf axils, cut bamboo stumps and fallen areca nut leaves are rich breeding sources. Elimina tion of these breeding sources in estates requires enormous efforts. Rank vegetations seen ubiquitously also serve as breeding sources. Removing all vegetations will harm the environment. Frequent rains also favour breeding of mosquitoes in plantations. 2. Accumulation of solid waste in the street: Solid waste disposal in many towns and USER 1 0 8 cities are not adequate. Domestic wastes are also thrown in the street in many places. The heaps of waste serve as breeding sources. Frequent rain fall favours the breeding of mosquitoes. 3. Water storage practices: In places where there is water scarcity, people store water for domestic use. People may not take precautions to avoid breeding in these containers even after repeated awareness. Lot of water scarce areas is found in most of the districts. 4. Presence of containers in and around houses: Plenty of containers are seen around the houses as there is some free land around many houses. More than 50% of Aedes breeding was encountered in such habitats. Containers are also seen in side the house. People may not take precautions to avoid breeding in these containers. Some of the houses in the urban areas may be kept locked with breeding containers for months together. Plastic containers, plastic sheets, bottles and carry bags are see n abundant in both urban and rural areas which forms major breeding source in these areas. Lot of tires are found as breeding sources especially in urban areas as every household has got one or two vehicles in their houses and more tire re trading centres in urban areas. 5. Negligence of people: In both urban and rural areas people are very busy with routine activities and not giving importance to avoid breeding in domestic and peri -domestic containers. They may not allow the strange volunteers to enter into the house to check the breeding. Behaviour change is not happening even after the intensive IEC/BCC campaigns. 6. Lack of human resource in urban areas: In Corporation and Municipality where there is no PHC/CHC, sufficient man power is not available to co -ordinate the disease control activities. The newly started urban PHCs are promising but sufficient health workers for disease control is lacking. 7. Strengthening of SSH: The existing SSH needs strengthening in terms of adequate human resources and other facilit ies. Additional SSH may be needed in Thiruvananthapuram and Kollam districts. Activities 1. Epidemic Preparedness and Rapid Response: Intensive source reduction activities will be done before monsoon in all places where vector indices are high. This will be done through campaign mode by motivating the PRIs and mobilizing the people. Involvement of Ward Health Sanitation and Nutrition Committee (WHSNC) and Residence Associations are crucial. Health department will make all preparations to prevent outbreaks, t o detect the outbreaks early and to initiate rapid response to contain the outbreak in the beginning itself. USER 1 0 9 New SSH need to be started and the existing SSHs will be strengthened for better surveillance and their link with DMO and PHC can be thus improved. 2. Source reduction in Plantations/estates: It is difficult to eliminate the sources in the entire estates. Source reduction will be done in and 100 meters around the houses in the estates and individual protection will be advocated for those who go beyond 100 meters. Legal action shall be initiated against the estate owners who do not implement measures to prevent breeding of mosquitoes. 3. Advocacy, Communication and Social Mobilization: Intensive IEC activities will be planned to mobilize the people for sou rce reduction campaigns, street cleansing, dry day observation, routine source reduction activities in and around the houses. 4. Capacity building of Doctors: Doctors in government and private sectors need to be sensitized with latest treatment protocols to p revent deaths and other complications. 5. Capacity building of Field Staff: training will be given to the health workers including ASHA and Anganwadi workers for early detection, referral and prompt reporting of dengue cases. 6. Strengthening of surveillance sys tem: Existing SSH will be strengthened in all districts with adequate manpower and other facilities. Instant communication between SSH, DMO and PHC will help to start the control measures early and the disease can be contained easily. Additional SSH may be started in needy districts. 7. Regulatory approach for enforcement of source reduction activities 8. Blood banks: There are 170 blood banks available in the state of which 33 in Govt sector,7 in cooperative sector and 130 in private sector. Blood collection and storage units are 55 in number and there are 36 blood component separation units also. These will be utilized for managing emergency situations in all districts. 9. Vector surveillance and Integrated Vector Management Weekly Aedes survey by Field staff and D istrict Vector Control units. High risk areas identified will be converted into low risk. In dengue case reported areas Integrated Vector Management will be done to make it low risk. 10. Arogya jagratha Since the year 2017 was really a challenging year for Ker ala as far as Public health is concerned. An action plan for prevention and control of communicable disease named Arogya Jagratha -2018 with activity calendar was prepared and activities were conducted as per the calendar. Ward Health and sanitation committ ee were reactivated and Arogya sena/Suchitwa squard/Haritha Karmasena/Kudumbasree volunteers etc were involved in the activities. An intensive and sustained mosquito control activity was conducted to prevent USER 1 1 0 outbreaks. A co -ordinated campaign with the help of other departments like LSG, Education, Social Justice, Agriculture, ISM, Animal Husbandry, Irrigation, Water Authority, Pollution control board and Suchitwa Mission could be conducted in all districts. Extensive repeated source reduction of mosquito br eeding sites was the main activity. This was done by community participation with the involvement of NGOs, community leaders, professional groups, religious institutions; ASHA, self-help groups for men and women and residence associations. MNREG Workers we re also involved in source reduction activities in rural areas. Sensitization meetings with various groups arranged to create awareness. Capacity building of health workers, voluntary workers, teachers, leaders etc were conducted to motivate the community to participate in the campaigns. All worked together for source reduction and other mosquito control activities. A special health squad with workers on daily wages was also constituted in high risk districts as well as corporation / municipal areas to bring down the vector indices to acceptable levels during the pre -monsoon and monsoon period. In 2019 also Arogya jagratha program is continued more effectively. The same can be followed in the coming years also. Japanese Encephalitis Japanese Encephalitis is not a major problem in the state. During 2017, 7 JE cases were reported from Palakkad, Thiruvananthapuram, Kottayam, Kasaragod dist ricts, No JE death during 2017.During 2018 there were 28 AES cases and 5 deaths due to AES. There were 7 cases from Malappuram, 6 cases and 4 deaths from Kozhikkode, Trivandrum -5,Alappuzha 4 cases and one death and Wayanad 2 cases. Out of 5 JE cases reported four were from Kozhikode and one was from Malappuram. There were 2 JE deaths from Kozhiko de. Regarding JE Kozhikode is the high-risk district in Kerala. 1. Training of doctors in Medical Colleges: Train the Physicians and Paediatricians in Medical Colleges to identify all AES cases and laboratory testing for JE. 2. Strengthen the co -ordination with PEID Cell: PEID Cell may keep good liaison with Physicians and Paediatricians for better case reporting 1. Diagnostic services: This is to meet the expenses for sending sample, transportation charges etc for confirmation of JE cases. 2. Vector control - Hands on training for JE vector surveillance for the DVC unit staff by State consultants was done during previous year. USER 1 1 1 3. Strengthening of Sentinel sites One sentinel lab in Trissur Medical College and test kits may be provided to State Public Health Lab, Thiruvananthapuram and Trissur Medical College 4. Actions undertaken and further proposed to reduce the burden of Vector Borne diseases in the State/UT 4.1 Activities conducted and planned for awareness generation on the health impacts of VBDs: a.

GIS to be utilised for data collection and analysis 2. Computer or Laptop facility for all Field staff 3. Posting of sufficient number of manpower in urban areas for data collection as well as prevention and control activities. 4. Posting of sufficient no. of JHIs so as to make it equal to no. of JPHNs 4.5 Activities un dertaken and further proposed related to integration with State Disaster Management Authority for emergency risk reduction and early response. Activities proposed 1. Arrange district level and State level meetings with Health dept. 2. Disseminate guidelines and IEC materials to Health dept 3. Sharing of data between SDMA and Health dept 4. Enlisting of high-risk areas and preparation of action plan for prevention/mitigation 5. Implementation of activities 4.6 How effective are current health and other sector p olicies and programmes to manage the Vector Borne diseases of the State/UT. USER 1 1 3 1. For managing VBDs intersectoral involvement and community participation are very important. Both these are inadequate as per current policies. There should have been a better system to monitor intersectoral co-ordination and community participation. 2. In the urban areas the existing health staff are not involved much in VBD prevention and control. Existing manpower is also less 3. No. of JHIs is considerably less when compared to JPHNs. 4. LSGIs entrust field staff like HI, JHI etc for duties other than health which may badly affect CD control activities. 5. Less political will for eco-friendly preventive activities. 4.7 Success Stories if any, of the State/ UT health sector for adaptation or mitigation of Vector Borne diseases (Please see explanation to next point) 4.8 Research studies, reports, innovative actions etc related to Vector Borne illnesses done in the states by Govt /NGO/ academic institution Innovative actions 1. In the context of increased incidence of fever and dengue fever in 2017, a comprehensive action plan named \"Arogya Jagratha\" was formulated for effective prevention and control of communicable diseases during 2018. Repeated consultative meetings at various levels including high level intersectoral coordination meetings were conducted to evaluate the situation and formulating action plan. Situations in each district were analyzed, hotspots for various diseases identified and based on district level action pla ns state level action plan was finalized. The action plan included yearlong activities for prevention and control of communicable diseases with month wise and date wise activity calendar to be followed by the concerned. Activities were planned and conducte d with support from other departments, agencies, voluntary associations and the public. Activities were conducted as per the calendar. The Local Self Government Department issued a circular for the effective implementation of Arogya Jagratha activities in the state. Necessary funds distributed at ward level. Cleaning, source reduction of mosquitoes and other pre-epidemic preparedness activities including action cum awareness campaigns were conducted. At grass root level Ward Health Sanitation committees wer e involved in planning and implementation of Arogya jagratha. Health squads were arranged at ward level for doing preventive activities. USER 1 1 4 As a result of this we could achieve considerable decrease in fever, dengue fever and H1 N1 in 2018 when compared with 2018. 2. \"Arogya Sandesayathra \"(ASY ) was conducted in all districts for 4 -5 days during February -March. It is a road show travelling from one end of the district to the other end with vehicles decorated with different IEC materials/ audio /video facility. The road show will travel all the Thaluks of the district covering the hot spots/vulnerable areas like tribal, coastal and urban slums. ASY is aimed to create health awareness among the public and for social mobilization to conduct Arogya Jagratha campaigns that in turn helps in prevention and control of communicable disease in the state. There will be an inaugural ses sion, a concluding session with at least two public meetings every day in the area. Involvement of Elected representatives including Ministers, MLAs, MPs, Civil society, NGOs, other department representatives ensured for these activities. Procession, rally , CD shows, folk arts, street plays etc were arranged as part of this. In addition, source reduction campaigns in public places, sensitization classes on safe water storage practices in water scarce areas, weekly dry day observation, personal protective me asures against mosquito bites, exhibitions etc were also conducted along with this programme. 3.Healthy Kerala Inspections formed another major component of Arogya Jagratha. This involved regulatory inspections based on existing public health Act and regu lations in the state. On fixed days in a month, public health inspections will be done by Health Staff and staff from LSGD or other departments in eateries/ houses/offices/institutions/migrant camps/construction sites/ plantations and issue notices or take other legal steps if public health issues including mosquitogenic conditions are created. USER 1 1 5 CHAPTER 10 HEALTH ADAPTATION PLAN FOR WATER BORNE DISEASES 1. Introduction Illnesses due to contaminated water and food are usually seen following flood, drought, religious or other mass gatherings. Water borne diseases such as typhoid, hepatitis, dysentery, and others caused from micro - organisms such as Vibrio vulnificus and Vibrio Yersinia, Legionella are some climate -dependant infectious diseases. The increase in temperature is seen to be associated with increased survival and abundance of micro -organisms44, 46. The decreased precipitation and drought result in decrease availability of safe -water reuse of wastewater, contamination of water source and transmission from vertebrate to human or human to human etc. Flooding cause contamination of water source as well as disruption of sewage disposal system, further contributors are population disp lacement, overcrowding, poor sanitation and hygiene, subsequent faeco -oral contamination and spread of pathogens. Enlist the causes of different water borne diseases in the state: 1. Acute Diarrheal Diseases - Rota Virus, Campylobacter, E coli, Shigella 2. Cholera 4. Amebiasis - Entamoeba H, Giardia Various factors (if any) contributing to increase/ decrease of respective water borne diseases in the state . 1. Flood, Contamination of water sources 2. Drought - Scarcity of water sources 3. Fare and Festival 4. Marriage function - Welcome drinks. List of the Priority Districts for Water borne diseases (according to Prevalence in the past years) 1.

USER 1 2 6 CHAPTER 12 HEALTH ADAPTATION PLAN FOR NUTRITION RELATED ILLNESSES Introduction Climate variability and extremes of weather events affect food quantity and quality through reducing production, poor storage, pathogen infestation, disrupted supply chain, hike in market price. Malnutrition and consequent disorders, like retarded child growth and development have been identified as one of the health threats by the Working Group -II to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernment al Panel on Climate Change. Climate change result in food insecurity, namely, food availability, food accessibility, food utilization, and food system stability. Drought occurrence diminishes crop yield, dietary diversity, supply chain disrupted, increase in market prices, also reduction in animal and aquatic products are being experienced. These factors reduce overall food consumption, and may therefore lead to macro as well as micronutrient deficiencies. For India, a proactive approach is critical as ne arly half of children (48%) aged less than five are chronically malnourished, more than half of women (55%) and almost one -quarter of men (24%) are anaemic (NFHS -3). The health of the vulnerable population is further threatened by the changing climate. For instance, in Gujarat, during a drought in the year 2000, diets were found to be deficient in energy and several vitamins. In this population, serious effects of drought on anthropometric indices may have been prevented by public - health measures48, 49. There are certain positive effects of climate change too, like modest reductions in cold - related morbidity and mortality, geographical shifts in food production, and reduced capacity of disease -carrying vectors due to exceeding of thermal thresholds. These positive effects will however be increasingly outweighed, worldwide, by the magnitude and severity of the negative effects of climate change.

USER 1 3 3 CHAPTER 13 HEALTH ADAPTATION PLAN FOR ALLERGIC ILLNESSES Introduction Climate variability and frequent change in weather and extreme events affects have been linked to increase in illnesses of lungs and cardio -vascular system. The IPCC AR5 mention few studies which states that ultraviolet radiation (UVR) are linked to highe r incidence of few skin carcinoma for every 1\u00b0C increment in average temperatures36. However, exposure to the sun has beneficial effects on synthesis of vitamin D, with important consequences for health. Accordingly, the balance of gains and losses due to increased UV exposures vary with location, intensity of exposure, and other factors (such as diet) that influence vitamin D levels. The excess of exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) even within the ambient environmental range may results in sunburn, photo -ageing, cataracts, immune suppression and skin melanomas37. UVR induced immune -suppression may influence occurrence of various infectious diseases as well as affect vaccine efficacy. There is evidence to s upport a relationship between sunburn during childhood and adolescence and skin cancer in adulthood. The World Health Organization (WHO) has argued that school sun protection programmes should be emphasised, because a portion of lifetime sun exposure occ urs during childhood and adolescence. Similarly, personal exposure studies among outdoor workers found that individuals engaged in road construction, horticulture, roofing and other outdoor occupations received ~20 - 26% of the total daily ambient solar UV radiation levels. Various studies showed varying prevalence allergic diseases in the state.The common types of allergic diseases in the state. 1. Asthma (20% -30%) 2. Allergic rhinitis Allergic conjunctivitis (5-12.5%) 5. Food allergies -5% USER 1 3 4 The causes of different allergic diseases in the state are 1.Seasonal change 2.Dust exposure 3.Contact with animals 4.Food substances 5.Medications 1. Association of other risk factors like smoking, diet, type of cooking fuel used at home and family history of allergy with risk of allergy among participants are also contributing to occurrence of allergic disorders. 2.

Such strategies will help to recognise allergic diseases as important chronic disease and public health issues by all levels of government. , provide direction to government agencies, to prevent allergic diseases, the most cost effective way to a ddress the current allergy epidemic, to Promote and expand existing best practice healthcare management, ensure consistency in education, training, preventative measures and healthcare policies, reduce unnecessary duplication of effort within and between different regions and will focus attenti on and research efforts on key allergic disease issues. USER 1 3 9 3.3Identify actions for risk reduction that are agreed upon by stakeholders and the public Prevention remains the best long -term strategy to reduce the growing burden of allergic disease. Evidences sh owed that a broad range of host and environmental factors interact during early development to influence patterns of immune response. The ideal strategy to address this would be to restore more optimal conditions during this critical period with concentrat ed efforts on the change in microbial exposure, dietary patterns and environmental pollutants . Current recommendations for allergy prevention also include avoidance of cigarette smoke, promotion of breastfeeding and use of hydrolysed formula when this is n ot possible), but future studies are likely to provide clearer recommendations around the use of probiotics, prebiotics and specific dietary nutrients.

Climate change influences various illnesses including respiratory tract infections like asthma, rhino -sinusitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), respiratory viral diseases (Avian Influenza) & circulatory collapse posing danger to cardiac pat ients. The cited reasons are poor air quality, high ozone, dust storms, extreme heat, desertification, alteration of allergens, change in timing and duration of survival and transmission cycle of respiratory virus, alteration in bird migration. Further the other contributory factors are demographic factors (age, sex, immunity status, pregnant women, prevailing endemic illnesses etc) low socio -economic status, overcrowding, poor hygienic conditions, accessibilities to health care facilities, population with tuberculosis, immune -compromised level, or mentally or physically challenged people37-39. Ischemic heart disease, Cerebro vascular disease, COPD, Asthma, Tuberculosis & pneumonia are the common cardio pulmonary diseases The main risk factors for different cardio -respiratory illnesses in the state: 1. CAD risk factors: Hypertension, Diabetes, Dyslipidaemia , Smoking, Obesity 2. Sedentary life style/ lack of physical activity 3. Change in dietary habits. (Less intake of fruits and vegetables) 4. Indoor & outdoor air pollution, smoking, occupational exposure, exposure to biomass fuel etc for asth ma & COPD 5. Diabetes is major cause for Pulmonary infection mainly Tuberculosis 2. Vulnerability Assessment for cardio -respiratory illnesses: Vulnerability assessment: Change in timing, survival, transmission & duration of certain microbes (like Influenza virus), Interaction of air pollution, pollen and weather, Proportion of population -malnourished, extremes of age, underlying illnesses, pregnant females, USER 1 4 4 Commonest type of occupation, urban slums and remote rural areas, Socio -economic status, accessibility to health care . 2.5 Indicators for cardio -respiratory diseases Kerala state is having NCD clinics in all health facilities including sub centres. The state is also focussing on early detection of diseases through population -based screening, work place interventions and other communit based activities. A special progra mme for COPD and Asthma is also being launched in the state for tracking the respiratory load along with RNTCP programme which is strengthened to capture all TB cases. Special focus is being given to preventive and promotive activities also. The Indicato rs will based on these activities like proportion of screenin g, proportion of detection, proportion of patients getting standard treatment, proportion of complications & proportion of mortality as well. The preventive and promotive activities will also be measured based on the services offered and number of beneficiaries Vulnerability assessment : Change in timing, survival, transmission & duration of certain microbes (like Influenza virus), Interaction of air pollution, pollen and weather, Proportion of population -malnourished, extremes of age, underlying illnesses, pregnant females, Commonest type of occupation, urban slums and remote rural areas, Socio -economic status, accessibility to health care 3.

Kerala state has, in course of last couple of decades undergone an enormous change in respect of both its physiography/climate and risks of emergence or resurgence of several vector -borne diseases. While Japanese encephalitis and filariasis had been endemic with focal distribution along certain coastal districts, malaria incidence has been on the rise with more indigenous cases reported every year. Significantly Kerala , which remained virtually a terra incognito for dengue infection till mid -1990s, has been experiencing a string of widespread epidemics annually and has now attained hyper endemicity causing appearance of DHF and DSS cases as well. The recent emergence of dengue fever in Kerala seems to have a definite correlation with the climatic change and the imposing anthropogenic stresses (Robin, 2012) The beautiful coast of Kerala is as much a part of the unique dynamics of Kerala's social history as its natural history. The coastal plain of Kerala also constitutes a special ecological mosaic. The Coastal Zone in Kerala is the low land fringing the sea extending over 560 krn, with a height of less than 8m from the MSL, covers about 15 % of the state's total area o f 38,863 sq.k m. A chain of water bodies, locally known as kayals running parallel/ oblique to the coastline is a characteristic feature of Kerala coast. These are mostly interconnected by natural or man -made canals, facilitating internal navigation almost for the entire length of the coast. Numerous perennial rivers discharge into these kayals. Southern half of the Kerala coast harbours more of larger backwaters. The kayals of the Kerala coast are mostly separated from the sea by elongated sandbars and base d on this they can be treated as \"coastal lagoons\". The coast is well known for several places of historical importance, heritage areas and areas of outstanding natural scenic beauty (ENVIS Kerala) The health impacts of sea level rise can be felt in a var iety of ways: drowning; injuries; risk of infectious diseases, and; severe mental health repercussions. Sea level rise induced storm surges and flooding can also affect critical infrastructure that impacts a healthy community life. Water treatment facilita tes, desalination plants, garbage disposal areas, emergency health care services, road and transportation systems can all be interrupted and compromised. This affects not only the costal inhabitants but affects all population dependent on coastal infrastru cture. Given that more than 63 million Indians live on low elevation coastal areas, with this number expected to increase to 216.4 million by 2060, there is potential for many people's health to be adversely affected8. The health impacts of sea level rise can be felt in a variety of ways: drowning; injuries; risk of infectious diseases, and; severe mental health repercussions. Sea level rise induced storm surges and flooding can also affect critical infrastructure that i mpacts a healthy community life.

This affects not only the costal inhabitants but affects all population dependent on coastal infrastructure. Given that more than 63 million Indians live on low elevation coastal areas, with this number expected to increase to 216.4 million by 2060, there is potential for many people's health to be a dversely affected9. Fishermen community is the biggest community in the coastal belt of the state, accounting to a total of 11 lakh people, out of which 8.55 lakh are marine. Active marine fishermen are around 2.28 lakh. Districts with maximum number of fishermen include: 1. Thiruvananthapuram 2. Alappuzha 3. Kollam 4. Kozhikode Innovative research relating oceans and human health is advancing our understanding of disease -causing organisms in coastal ecosystems. Novel techniques are elucidating the loading, transport and fate of pathogens in coastal ecosystems, and identifying sources of contamination. Marine ecosystem is being threatened by the discharge of untreated sewage wastes and industrial effluents which ultimately affects the sustainability of l iving resources and public health. These wastes carry enormous level of microbial pathogens (ICMR, 2006). Types of diseases prevalent in the sea and coastal areas of the state According to the statistics of IDSP, Department of Health and Family Welfare, Government of Kerala, Dengue is the most common (indicator) communicable disease in the state.

These includes eastern high lands (rugged and cool mountainous terrain), the central mid lands(rolling hills) and western low lands. The hill and mountain regions are playing a crucial r ole in maintaining the climate and physiography of the entire region. The Western Ghats is a continuous mountain range of 450 Km along the eastern side of Kerala. It forms almost an unbroken wall guarding the eastern frontier and helps the people of Kerala to lead a sheltered life of their own through centuries. It is also responsible for the high and steady rainfall in Kerala. The main problems of the Western Ghats r egion are the pressure of increasing population on land and vegetation , undesirable agricultural practices etc. These factors have contributed to ecological, environmental and health problems in these regions. In addition to this, these Western Ghat areas are homeland to various tribal communities in Kerala. Majority of the Primitive tribal groups in Kerala are inhabiting the western slopes of the western Ghat regions are undergoing various socio -economic transitions and their needs, problems also vary from one another. Various types of diseases prevalent in the hilly and mountainous areas of the state. Both communicable & Non communicable diseases are seen in these areas. The prevalence - of Non - Communicable diseases and its risk factors are increasing day by day. The Whole state is facing an uphill task of non -communicable diseases like diabetes, coronary, heart disease, renal disease, cancer (especially oral cancer) and geriatric problems. Emerging new public health problems like chikungunya fever, dengue fever, leptospirosis, swine flu (HINI) etc. also are a major concern. Other than these there are newer threats to the health scenario of the state, to mention a few mental health problems, suicide, substance abuse and alcoholism, adolescent health issues and rising number of road traffic accidents. Another concern is the re -emergence of some diseases like Malaria and Cholera. To tackle these concerted and committed efforts with proper inter sectoral co -ordination is essential. Various Zoonotic diseases lik e KFDs are more prevalent in areas close to forest zones especially in Western Ghat regions. Human animal conflicts are another challenge. Vector borne diseases like Dengue and other communicable diseases like leishmaniosis, leprosy and scrub typhus are al so common in mountainous regions of the state. Causes of different diseases prevalent in the hilly and mountainous areas of the state: 1. Unhealthy life style pattern and habits such as pan chewing, substance abuse an 2. Non -compliance to medical treatment 3. Inadequate accessibility to health care facilities in very remote areas Various factors contributing to increase/ decrease of diseases prevalent in the hilly and mountainous areas of the state: 1. Marginalized groups are more at risk of NCDs a s they have limited access to health services, more exposed to harmful addictions like tobacco and unhealthy diet. USER 1 7 7 2. Elderly population 3.

Climate change is a major contributing factor towards these increased incidents of extreme events. The primary impact of extreme weather events on population includes morbi dity and mortality. The secondary effects comprise of impacts of extreme events on the ecological system as well as the burden it place s on the public health system of the state (Greenough, 2001) . The impact on public health system involves massive population displacement, destruction of existing safe water supplies and sanitation facilities and disruption of immunization and vector control programs and surveillance. States and UTs may have recorded raised morbidity and mortal ity due to effect of extreme weather conditions viz frequent and severe episodes of heat waves, floods, droughts and fires as a direct impact of climate variability and affecting population at large. Climate change can result in more hot days, resulting in more periods of 'drought', 'dust storms', or 'heavy rains (precipitation)', and even 'flooding'. The health gets directly affected due to injuries, hypothermia, hyperthermia, drowning and indirectly through population dislocation, crowding, poor living co nditions, faeco -oral transmission of gastro - intestinal pathogens causing water and food borne illnesses, respiratory illness and other infectious diseases (e.g., leptospirosis, vector -borne disease, cholera and also mental illnesses)48-50. The reason prima rily is due to contamination of water and sewage disposal. Enlist ed below the various types of diseases prevalent during disasters in the state.

Communication and training are crucial in adaptation to variability or changes in the climate. Communication programmes based on a thor ough needs assessment must aim to enable and empower people, in particular, the illiterate, poor and other vulnerable people such as women, children, the elderly, people suffering from debilitating medical problems and those living in coastal areas, highla nds and urban slums. Such programmes should have adequate and appropriately designed communication tools that are locally suitable, popular and comprehensible. Effective communication and public awareness activities/advocacy: sensitize, orient and take sup port of leaders/ opinion makers / stakeholders/ celebrities/ civil societies. Communication intervention for target audience: Appropriate, efficient and cost - effective measures include clear and timely information covering who is involved; what happened; w hen it happened; where it happened; and why or how it happened or what may happen - how, why, where, among whom and how to face it. State and district level capacity building institutions needs to be identified for capacity building of health staff: includ e training and imparting technical skills for case management, risk assessment skills, entomology, epidemiology, climate models, disaster management, meteorology, monitoring and evaluation, and research. Conducive institutional and management arrangements to ensure involvement of private sector by forming public private partnerships. Hospital and all other health -care systems must be strengthened. Involve community in the process of strengthening and in managing and maintaining the system. Inventory management: standardized list of adequate and appropriate logistics medicines, kits, equipment and machines along with efficient storage systems. Specific strategies and standard operating procedures for managing climate sensitive diseases need to be developed in light of the future impacts of climate change with prevention in mind.
