The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) compiles yearly death rates, categorizing all deaths by cause. During the year 2002, the ACTUAL number of deaths attributed to influenza was only 753. [ [3](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr52/nvsr52_13.pdf)] (See p.16 and the table below) AND... almost all of those deaths occurred in people over the age of 75, in individuals who had pre-existing serious health conditions, AND weakened immune systems. Accurate statistical analyses are complicated by the fact that the diagnostic codes, which classify diseases (known as \" [ICD-9 codes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ICD-9_codes)\") lump flu and pneumonia together in the same sub-section. This *could* be why ACP made their mistake, although I seriously doubt it. Here are the actual statistics: DISEASE # of deaths Influenza and pneumonia ....... 65,984 Influenza ................. 753 Pneumonia ................. 65,231 Shamefully, during that same year, when 753 people died from flu complications, 3,454 Americans died from malnutrition \u2014 13 times as many people! It's a shame that we don't immunize for malnutrition. [ [3](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr52/nvsr52_13.pdf)] | | Editor's Comment: The yearly \"National Vital Statistics Report: Deaths: Preliminary Data\" that is quoted above (Citation #3) has since discontinued breaking out the death rates for \"Influenza and pneumonia\" into 2 distinct categories, and now lump together the combined incidence, without identifying the deaths caused solely by the flu. My suspicion is that the vaccine industry \"fix\" is in, and that CDC (or their admin betters) have made it impossible for CDC researchers like Lone Simonsen, Ph.D. (see below) to continue to rattle their chain. More Disturbing Flu Vaccine Statistics Even more upsetting is a study published in 2005 by Lone Simonsen, Ph.D., and his team at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease at the National Institutes For Health (NIH). They concluded that flu shots have had NO IMPACT AT ALL in reducing deaths from flu complications in people over the age of 65. [ [4](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15710788)] Their study discerned no changes in death rates from 1980, when only 20 million people received a flu shot, to more recent years when over 80 million did. Thus, flu shots appear to be failing to achieve their major objective: lowering death rates. [ [4](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15710788)] Please do NOT dismiss this as an *anti-vaccination* posting. There is no doubt that vaccinations for polio and smallpox has saved millions of lives. When it comes to vaccinating against nuisance illnesses, I believe that the risk-to-benefit ratio is so vastly reduced that we must look more closely at the actual benefits versus the health risks. | || | [ Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/report-problem-center-biologics-evaluation-research/vaccine-adverse-events) The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is a Cooperative Program for Vaccine Safety of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). VAERS is a post-marketing safety surveillance program, collecting information about adverse events (side effects) that occur after the administration of US licensed vaccines.

The members of the Association voted this week at their 57th Annual Meeting in St. Louis to pass a resolution calling for an end to mandatory childhood vaccines. The resolution passed without a single \"no\" vote. \"Our children face the possibility of death or serious long-term adverse effects from mandated vaccines that aren't necessary or that have very limited benefits,\" said Jane M.

The paper examines the nature of adverse health events that are likely to occur in connection with the smallpox vaccine, assesses the liability protections that have been established for organizations and individuals participating in the vaccination program, and discusses the compensation mechanisms being considered to address the damages incurred by volunteers who may suffer from adverse vaccine reactions. Specifically, the implications of the Federal Tort Claims Act, workers' compensation programs, and the creation of a new no-fault compensation fund are explored. | || | [ Chiropractic Students' Attitudes about Vaccination: ](http://www.cmaj.ca/content/166/12/1544.full) A Cause for Concern? Canadian Medical Association Journal 2002 (Jun 11); 166 (12) In the survey reported on page 1531 of this issue, Busse and colleagues discovered an unsettling trend during the professional education of chiropractic students. The authors found that while some students had negative attitudes toward vaccination on entering their training for the profession, many others appeared to develop such attitudes as they progressed through their studies. Yet the core curriculum of the Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College (CMCC), where the survey was conducted, teaches both immunology and health promotion and is itself supportive of vaccination. In addition, the policy viewpoint of the Canadian Chiropractic Association also supports vaccination as it is currently practised in Canada. The Busse article [\"Attitudes Toward Vaccination: A Survey of Canadian Chiropractic Students\"](http://www.cmaj.ca/content/166/12/1531.full) concluded that \"Most CMCC students reported pro-vaccination attitudes, but there appeared to be an increase in anti-vaccination attitudes as students progressed through the CMCC program. This pattern was seen almost exclusively among students who relied primarily on informal sources of vaccine information rather than on core CMCC lectures or prior lectures at university.\" | || |[ ] [ The Virus and the Vaccine](../Graphics_Box_LINKS/FULL/The_Virus_and_the_Vaccine.html) The Atlantic Monthly February 2000 A simian virus known as SV40 has been associated with a number of rare human cancers.

Over the decades, several hundred million pertussis shots have been given around the world - today, nearly 90 percent of American 2-year-olds have been immunized - but there still is no agreement on the graver reactions to the vaccine. The literature has recorded hundreds of instances - perhaps 1 in every 300,000 shots - in which children died within a few days of a DPT shot, or suffered recurring seizures that brought on retardation or other chronic brain damage. | || | [ Parents Requesting Open Vaccine Education](http://vaccineinfo.net/) We provide information on vaccines, and the immunization policies and practices that affect the children and adults of Texas.

The Australian Vaccination Network is working to help parents take back that right to free and informed choice by allowing them to see both sides of this issue before making a decision. | || | [ World Health Organization (WHO) Vaccine and Immunization Page](http://www.who.int/immunization/en/) WHO is committed to: (a) To ensure the quality and safety of vaccines and other biological medicines through the development and establishment of global norms and standards, (b) To assess the strategies and activities for reducing morbidity and mortality of vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs), and (c) To reduce financial and technical barriers to the introduction of new and existing vaccines and immunization-related technologies.
