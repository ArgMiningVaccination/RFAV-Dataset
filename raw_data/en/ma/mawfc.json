About Our Pr escription Drug Coverage and Medicar e OPM has determined that the Government Employees Health Association, Inc. prescription drug coverage is, on average, expected to pay out as much as the standard Medicare prescription drug coverage will pay for all plan participants and is considered Creditable Coverage. This means you do not need to enroll in Medicare Part D and pay extra for prescription drug coverage. If you decide to enroll in Medicare Part D later , you will not have to pay a penalty for late enrollment as long as you keep your FEHB coverage. However , if you choose to enroll in Medicare Part D, you can keep your FEHB coverage and your FEHB plan will coordinate benefits with Medicare. Remember: If you are an annuitant and you cancel your FEHB coverage, you may not re-enroll in the FEHB Program. Please be advised If you lose or drop your FEHB coverage and go 63 days or longer without prescription drug coverage that is at least as good as Medicare' s prescription drug coverage, your monthly Medicare Part D premium will go up at least 1 percent per month for every month that you did not have that coverage. For example, if you go 19 months without Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage, your premium will always be at least 19 percent higher than what many other people pay . Y ou will have to pay this higher premium as long as you have Medicare prescription drug coverage. In addition, you may have to wait until the next Annual Coordinated Election Period (October 15 through December 7) to enroll in Medicare Part D. Medicar e' s Low Income Benefits For people with limited income and resources, extra help paying for a Medicare prescription drug plan is available. Information regarding this program is available through the Social Security Administration (SSA) online at www . socialsecurity .gov , or call the SSA at 800-772-1213, (TTY : 800-325-0778).

Pr otect Y ourself Fr om Fraud - Here are some things that you can do to prevent fraud: Do not give your plan identification (ID) number over the phone or to people you do not know , except for y our healthcare providers, authorized health benefits plan, or OPM representative. Let only the appropriate medical professionals review your medical record or recommend services. A void using healthcare providers who say that an item or service is not usually covered, but they know how to bill us to get it paid. Carefully review Explanation of Benefits (EOBs) statements that you receive from us. Periodically review your claims history for accuracy to ensure we have not been billed for services y ou did not receive. Do not ask your doctor to make false entries on certificates, bills, or records in order to get us to pay for an item or service. If you suspect that a provider has char ged you for services you did not receive, billed you twice for the same service, or misrepresented any information, do the following: - Call the provider and ask for an explanation. There may be an error . 3 2022 GEHA Benefit Plan Introduction/Plain Language/Advisory - If the provider does not resolve the matter , call us at 844-510-0048 or go to www .lighthouse-services.com/geha and explain the situation. - If we do not resolve the issue: CALL - THE HEAL THCARE FRAUD HOTLINE 877-499-7295 OR go to www .opm.gov/our -inspector -general/hotline-to-r eport-fraud-waste-or -abuse/complaint-form The online r eporting form is the desir ed method of r eporting fraud in order to ensur e accuracy , and a quicker r esponse time.

While death is the most tragic outcome, medical mistakes cause other problems such as permanent disabilities, extended hospital stays, longer recoveries, and even additional treatments. Medical mistakes and their consequences also add significantly to the overall cost of healthcare . Hospitals and healthcare providers are being held accountable for the quality of care and reduction in medical mistakes by their accrediting bodies. Y ou can also improve the quality and safety of your own healthcare and that of your family members by learning more about and understanding your risks. T ake these simple steps: 1. Ask questions if you have doubts or concerns. - Ask questions and make sure you understand the answers. - Choose a doctor with whom you feel comfortable talking. - T ake a relative or friend with you to help you take notes, ask questions, and understand answers. 2. Keep and bring a list of all the medications you take. - Bring the actual medication or give your doctor and pharmacist a list of all the medications and dosages that you take, including non-prescription (over -the-counter) medications and nutritional supplements. - T ell your doctor and pharmacist about any drug, food, and other aller gies you have, such as latex. - Ask about any risks or side ef fects of the medication and what to avoid while taking it. Be sure to write down what your doctor or pharmacist says. - Make sure your medication is what the doctor ordered. Ask the pharmacist about your medication if it looks dif ferent than you expected. - Read the label and patient package insert when you get your medication, including all warnings and instructions. - Know how to use your medication. Especially note the times and conditions when your medication should and should not be taken. - Contact your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. - Understand both the generic and brand names of your medication. This helps ensure you do not receive double dosing from taking both a generic and a brand. It also helps prevent you from taking a medication to which you are aller gic. 3. Get the r esults of any test or pr ocedur e. - Ask when and how you will get the results of tests or procedures. W ill it be in person, by phone, mail, through the Plan or Provider's portal? - Don' t assume the results are fine if you do not get them when expected. Contact your healthcare provider and ask for your results. - Ask what the results mean for your care. 4. T alk to your doctor about which hospital or clinic is best for your health needs. - Ask your doctor about which hospital or clinic has the best care and results for your condition if you have more than one hospital or clinic to choose from to get the healthcare you need. - Be sure you understand the instructions you get about follow-up care when you leave the hospital or clinic. 5. Make sur e you understand what will happen if you need surgery . - Make sure you, your doctor , and your sur geon all agree on exactly what will be done during the operation. - Ask your doctor , \"Who will manage my care when I am in the hospital?\" - Ask your sur geon: - \"Exactly what will you be doing?\" - \"About how long will it take?\" - \"What will happen after sur gery?\" - \"How can I expect to feel during recovery?\" 5 2022 GEHA Benefit Plan Introduction/Plain Language/Advisory - T ell the sur geon, anesthesiologist, and nurses about any aller gies, bad reactions to anesthesia, and any medications or nutritional supplements you are taking.

Pr eventable Healthcar e Acquir ed Conditions (\"Never Events\") When you enter the hospital for treatment of one medical problem, you do not expect to leave with additional injuries, infections, or other serious conditions that occur during the course of your stay . Although some of these complications may not be avoidable, patients do suf fer from injuries or illnesses that could have been prevented if doctors or the hospital had taken proper precautions. Errors in medical care that are clearly identifiable, preventable and serious in their consequences for patients can indicate a significant problem in the safety and credibility of a healthcare facility . These conditions and errors are sometimes called \"Never Events\" or \"Serious Reportable Events.\" W e have a benefit payment policy that encourages hospitals to reduce the likelihood of hospital-acquired conditions such as certain infections, severe bedsores, and fractures, and to reduce medical errors that should never happen. When such an event occurs, neither you nor your FEHB plan will incur costs to correct the medical error . Y ou will not be billed for inpatient services related to treatment of specific hospital acquired conditions or for inpatient services needed to correct \"Never Events\", if you use Aetna Signature Administrators, UnitedHealthcare Choice Plus, UnitedHealthcare Options PPO, or UnitedHealthcare Select Plus. \"Never Event\" is defined by your claims administrator using national standards. Never Events are errors in medical care that are clearly identifiable, preventable and serious in their consequences for patients, and that indicate a real problem in the safety and credibility of a healthcare facility . This policy helps to protect you from preventable medical errors and improve the quality of care you receive. 6 2022 GEHA Benefit Plan Introduction/Plain Language/Advisory FEHB Facts Coverage information W e will not refuse to cover the treatment of a condition you had before you enrolled in this Plan solely because you had the condition before you enrolled.

This law mandates that you be enrolled for Self Plus One or Self and Family coverage in the FEHB Program, if you are an employee subject to a court or administrative order requiring you to provide health benefits for your child(ren). If this law applies to you, you must enroll in Self Plus One or Self and Family coverage in a health plan that provides full benefits in the area where your children live or provide documentation to your employing of fice that you have obtained other health benefits coverage for your children. If this law applies to you, and only one child is involved in the court or administrative order , you may enroll for Self Plus One coverage in a health plan that provides full benefits in the area where your child lives or provide documentation to your employing of fice that you have obtained other health benefits coverage for the child. If you do not do so, your employing of fice will enroll you involuntarily as follows: If you have no FEHB coverage, your employing of fice will enroll you for Self Plus One or Self and Family coverage, as appropria te in the lowest-cost nationwide plan option as determined by OPM; If you have a Self Only enrollment in a fee-for -service plan or in an HMO that serves the area where your children live, your employing of fice will change your enrollment to Self Plus One or Self and Family , as appropriate, in the same option of the same plan; or If you are enrolled in an HMO that does not serve the area where the children live, your employing of fice will change your enrollment to Self Plus One or Self and Family , as appropriate, in the lowest-cost nationwide plan option as determined by OPM. As long as the court/administrative order is in ef fect, and you have at least one child identified in the order who is still eligible under the FEHB Program, you cannot cancel your enrollment, change to Self Only , or change to a plan that does not serve the area in which your children live, unless you provide documentation that you have other coverage for the children. If the court/administrative order is still in ef fect when you retire, and you have at least one child still eligible for FEHB coverage, you must continue your FEHB coverage into retirement (if eligible) and cannot cancel your coverage, change to Self Only , or change to a plan that does not serve the area in which your children live as long as the court/administrative order is in ef fect.

If you ar e hospitalized when your enr ollment begins The pre-service claim approval processes for inpatient hospital admissions (called precertification) and for other services, are detailed in this Section. A pr e-service claim is any claim, in whole or in part, that requires approval from us in advance of obtaining medical care or services. In other words, a pre-service claim for benefits (1) requires precertification or preauthorization and (2) will result in a reduction of benefits if you do not obtain precertification or preauthorization. Y ou need prior Plan appr oval for certain services Pr ecertification is the process by which - prior to your inpatient hospital admission - we evaluate the medical necessity of your proposed stay and the number of days required to treat your condition. Unless we are misled by the information given to us, we won' t change our decision on medical necessity . In most cases, your physician or hospital will take care of requesting precertification. Because you are still responsible for ensuring that your care is precertified, you should always ask your physician or hospital whe ther or not the y have contacted us. Inpatient hospital admission (including Residential T r eatment Centers, Skilled Nursing Facility , Long T erm Acute Car e or Rehab Facility) 19 2022 GEHA Benefit Plan Section 3 First, you, your representative, your physician or your hospital must call to obtain preauthorization before an inpatient hospital admission, Residential T reatment Center (R TC) admission, or for services requiring precertification are rendered.

How to pr ecertify an admission to a Hospital, Residential T r eatment Centers, Skilled Nursing Facility , Long-T erm Acute Car e or Rehab Facility Y ou must get precertification for certain services prior to admission. Failure to do so will result in the following penalties: PPO: W e will reduce our benefits for the Inpatient Hospital, Long-T erm Acute Care, Residential T reatment Facility (R TC), Skilled Nursing (SNF), or Rehabilitation Facility stay by $500 if precertification is not obtained prior to admission. If the stay is not medically necessary , we will only pay for any covered medical services and supplies that are otherwise payable on an outpatient basis. Non-PPO: - W e will reduce our benefits for the Inpatient Hospital, Long-T erm Acute Care, Residential T reatment Facility (R TC), Skilled Nursing (SNF), or Rehabilitation Facility stay by $500 per day for each day that is not precertified prior to admission.

W arning Y ou do not need precertification in these cases: Y ou are admitted to a hospital outside the United States; Y ou have another group health insurance policy that is the primary payor for the hospital stay; or Medicare Part A is the primary payor for the hospital stay . Note: If you exhaust your Medicare hospital benefits and do not want to use your Medicare lifetime reserve days, then we will become the primary payor and you do need precertification. Exceptions For non-ur gent care claims, we will tell the physician and/or hospital the number of approved inpatient days, or the care that we approve for other services that must have precertification . W e will make our decision within 15 days of receipt of the pre-service claim. Non-urgent car e claims 20 2022 GEHA Benefit Plan Section 3 If matters beyond our control require an extension of time, we may take up to an additional 15 days for review and we will notify you of the need for an extension of time before the end of the original 15-day period. Our notice will include the circumstances underlying the request for the extension and the date when a decision is expected.

Y our Costs for Cover ed Services This is what you will pay out-of-pocket for your covered care: Coinsurance is the percentage of our allowance that you must pay for your care. Coinsurance doesn't begin until you meet your deductible. W e will base this percentage on either the billed char ge or the Plan allowance, whichever is less. Example: Under the High Option, you pay 25% of our allowance for non-PPO of fice visits. Coinsurance A copayment is a fixed amount of money you pay to the provider , facility , pharmacy , etc., when you receive certain services. Example: When you see your PPO physician, under the High Option, you pay a copayment of $20 per visit. Note: If the billed amount (or the Plan allowance that providers we contract with have agreed to accept as payment in full) is less than your copayment, you pay the lower amount. Copayments Cost-sharing is the general term used to refer to your out-of-pocket costs (e.g., deductible, coinsurance, and copayments) for the covered care you receive. Cost-sharing A deductible is a fixed amount of covered expenses you must incur for certain covered services and supplies before we start paying benefits for them. Copayments and coinsurance amounts do not count toward any deductible. When a covered service or supply is subject to a deductible, only the Plan allowance for the service or supply counts toward the deductible. The calendar year deductible is $350 per person under High and Standard Option. Under a Self Only enrollment, the deductible is considered satisfied and benefits are payable for you when your covered expenses applied to the calendar year deductible for your enrollment reach $350. Under the Self Plus One and the Self and Family enrollments, once the calendar year deductible amount of $350 is satisfied for an individual, covered benefits are payable for that individual. Additionally , all individual deductible amounts will apply toward the Self Plus One or Family calendar year deductible of $700 for the High and Standard Options; once that amount is reached, benefits become payable for all family members. If the billed amount (or the Plan allowance that providers we contract with have agreed to accept as payment in full) is less than the remaining portion of your deductible, you pay the lower amount. Example: If the billed amount is $100, the provider has an agreement with us to accept $80, and you have not paid any amount toward meeting your calendar year deductible, you must pay $80. W e will apply $80 to your deductible. W e will begin paying benefits once the remaining portion of your calendar year deductible ($350 per person under High and Standard Option) has been satisfied. Note: If you change plans during Open Season and the ef fective date of your new plan is after January 1 of the next year , you do not have to start a new deductible under your prior plan between January 1 and the ef fective date of your new plan. If you change plans at another time during the year , you must begin a new deductible under your new plan. If you change options in this Plan during the year , we will credit the amount of covered expenses already applied toward the deductible of your old option to the deductible of your new option. Deductible If your provider routinely waives (does not require you to pay) your copayments, deductibles, or coinsurance, the provider is misstating the fee and may be violating the law . In this case, when we calculate our share, we will reduce the provider's fee by the amount waived. For example, if your physician ordinarily char ges $100 for a service but routinely waives your 25% coinsurance, the actual char ge is $75. W e will pay $56.25 (75% of the actual char ge of $75). If your pr ovider r outinely waives your cost 26 2022 GEHA Benefit Plan Section 4 In some instances, a provider may ask you to sign a \"waiver\" prior to receiving care. This waiver may state that you accept responsibility for the total char ge for any care that is not covered by your health plan. If you sign such a waiver , whether or not you are responsible for the total char ge depends on the contracts that the Plan has with its providers. If you are asked to sign this type of waiver please be aware that if benefits are denied for the services, you could be legally liable for the related expenses. If you would like more information about waivers, please contact us at 800-821-6136 or write to GEHA, P . O. MN 55121. W aivers Our \"Plan allowance\" is the amount we use to calculate our payment for covered services. Fee-for - service plans arrive at their allowances in dif ferent ways, so their allowances vary . For more information about how we determine our Plan allowance, see the definition of Plan allowance in Section 10. Often, the provider's bill is more than a fee-for -service plan's allowance. Whether or not you have to pay the dif ference between our allowance and the bill will depend on the provider you use. For more information about out-of-area services, see W e have a Preferred Provider Or ganization (PPO) in Section 1. PPO pr oviders agree to limit what they will bill you. Because of that, when you use a preferred provider , your share of covered char ges consists only of your deductible and coinsurance or copayment. Here is an example about coinsurance: Y ou see a PPO physician who char ges $150, but our allowance is $100. If you have met your deductible, you are only responsible for your coinsurance. That is, with High Option, you pay just - 10% of our $100 allowance ($10). Because of the agreement, your PPO physician will not bill you for the $50 dif ference between our allowance an d the bill. Non-PPO pr oviders , on the other hand, have no agreement to limit what they will bill you. When you use a non-PPO provider , you will pay your deductible and coinsurance - plus any dif ference between our allowance and char ges on the bill. Here is an example. Y ou see a non- PPO physician who char ges $150 and our allowance is again $100. Because you've met your deductible, you are responsible for your coinsurance, so with High Option you pay 25% of our $100 allowance ($25). Plus, because there is no agreement between the non-PPO physician and us, the physician can bill you for the $50 dif ference between our allowance and thebill. The following table illustrates the examples of how much you have to pay out-of-pocket, under the High Option, for services from a PPO physician vs. a non-PPO physician. The table uses our example of a service for which the physician charges $150 and our allowance is $100. The table shows the amount you pay if you have met your calendar year deductible. EXAMPLE PPO physician Physician's charge: $150 Our allowance: We set it 90% : pay: 75% of our $50 TOTAL YOU P AY: $75 You should also see section Important Notice About Surprise Billing - Know Your Rights below that describes your protections against surprise billing under the No Surprises Act. Differ ences between our allowance and the bill 27 2022 GEHA Benefit Plan Section 4 For High and Standard Option medical and sur gical services with coinsurance, we pay 100% of our allowable amount for the remainder of the calendar year after out-of-pocket expenses for deductibles, coinsurance and copayments exceed: Y our ophic pocket maximum for deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments For High Option, the out-of-pocket maximum is $5,000 for Self Only enrollment; $10,000 when enrollment is Self Plus One or Self and Family when you use PPO providers. For Standard Option the out-of-pocket maximum is $6,500 for self only enrollment; $13,000 when enrollment is Self Plus One or Self and Family if you use PPO providers. Only out-of-pocket expenses from PPO providers count toward these limits. - An individual under Self Plus One and Self and Family enrollment will never have to satisfy more than what is required for the out-of-pocket maximum under a Self only enrollment. PPO For High Option the out-of-pocket maximum is $7,000 for Self Only enrollment; $14,000 when enrollment is Self Plus One or Self and Family . For Standard Option, the out-of-pocket maximum is $8,500 for Self Only enrollment; $17,000 when enrollment is Self Plus One or Self and Family if you use non-PPO providers. Any of the above expenses for PPO providers also count toward this limit. Non-PPO coinsurance will not accumulate to the PPO maximum unless meeting criteria to be reimbursed at the PPO rate (reference the No Surprise Act). Y our eligible out-of-pocket expenses will not exceed this amount whether or not you use PPO Providers. - An individual under Self Plus One and Self and Family enrollment will never have to satisfy more than what is required for the out-of-pocket maximum under a Self only enrollment. Out-of-pocket expenses for PPO and non-PPO benefits are the expenses you pay for covered services. The following cannot be counted toward catastrophic protection out-of-pocket expenses: Expenses you pay for non-covered services; Expenses in excess of our allowable amount or maximum benefit limitations; Expenses in excess of plan limits for dental; The cost for non-approved medication and drugs that we exclude; Any amounts you pay because benefits have been reduced for non-compliance with our cost containment requirements (see Section 3); and The dif ference (Standard and High Option) between the cost of the generic and brand name medication. Non-PPO If you changed to this Plan during Open Season from a plan with a catastrophic protection benefit and the ef fective date of the change was after January 1, any expenses that would have applied to that plan's catastrophic protection benefit during the prior year will be covered by your prior plan if they are for care you received in January before your ef fective date of coverage in this Plan. If you have already met your prior plan's catastrophic protection benefit level in full, it will continue to apply until the ef fective date of your coverage in this Plan. If you have not met this expense level in full, your prior plan will first apply your covered out-of-pocket expenses until the prior year's catastrophic level is reached and then apply the catastrophic protection benefit to covered out-of- pocket expenses incurred from that point until the ef fective date of your coverage in this Plan. Y our prior plan will pay these covered expenses according to this year's benefits; benefit changes are ef fective January 1. Note: If you change options in this Plan during the year , we will credit the amount of covered expenses already accumulated toward the catastrophic out-of-pocket limit of your old option to the catastrophic protection limit of your new option. Carryover 28 2022 GEHA Benefit Plan Section 4 W e will make diligent ef forts to recover benefit payments we made in error but in good faith. W e may reduce subsequent benefit payments to of fset overpayments. If we overpay you Facilities of the Department of V eteran Af fairs, the Department of Defense, and the Indian Health Service are entitled to seek reimbursement from us for certain services and supplies they provide to you or a family member . They may not seek more than their governing laws allow . Y ou may be responsible to pay for certain services and char ges. Contact the government facility directly for more information. When Government facilities bill us The No Surprises Act (NSA) is a federal law that provides you with protections against \"surprise billing\" and \"balance billing\" under certain circumstances. A surprise bill is an unexpected bill you receive from a nonparticipating healthcare provider , facility , or air ambulance service for healthcare. Surprise bills can happen when you receive emer gency care - when you have little or no say in the facility or provider from whom you receive care. They can also happen when you receive non-emer gency services at participating facilities, but you receive some care from nonparticipating providers. Balance billing happens when you receive a bill from the nonparticipating provider , facility , or air ambulance service for the dif ference between the nonparticipating provider's char ge and the amount payable by your health plan. Y our health plan must comply with the NSA protections that hold you harmless from unexpected bills. For specific information on surprise billing, the rights and protections you have, and your responsibilities, go to www .geha.com or contact the health plan at 800-821-6136.

An accidental injury is a bodily injury sustained solely through violent, external, and accidental means, such as broken bones, animal bites, and poisonings. What is a medical emergency? A medical emer gency is the sudden and unexpected onset of a condition or an injury that you believe endangers your life or could result in serious injury or disability , and requires immediate medical or sur gical care. Some problems are emer gencies because, if not treated promptly , they might become more serious; examples include deep cuts and broken bones. Others are emer gencies because they are potentially life threatening, such as heart attacks, strokes, poisonings, gunshot wounds, or sudden inability to breathe. There are many other acute conditions that we may determine are medical emer gencies - what they all have in common is the need for quick action.

When a claim is submitted for online processing or direct reimbursement of a compound medication, the pricing is based on the contractual discounts plus a professional fee and any applicable sales tax. Pharmacies must submit all ingredients in a compound prescription as part of the claim for both online claims and paper claim submissions.

High Option and Standard Option Pr escription Drug T iers Under the High Option and Standard Option , we divide prescription drugs into categories or tiers: generic, preferred, and non- preferred medications. Please note specialty medications can be considered either preferred or non-preferred. When an approved generic equivalent is available, that is the drug you will receive, unless you or your physician specifies the prescription must be dispensed as written. When an approved generic equivalent is not available, you will pay the preferred or non-preferred applicable plan coinsurance. If an approved generic equivalent is available, but you or your physician specifies that the prescription must be dispensed as written with the brand name medication, you will pay the generic copayment plus the dif ference between the cost of the generic drug and the brand name drug dispensed. Y our physician may request the brand name drug be approved through a medical necessity review . If your brand name drug is approved as medically necessary , your coinsurance will be the applicable brand name coinsurance. Generic drugs are chemically and therapeutically equivalent to the corresponding brand name drug, but are available at a lower price. Equivalent generic products for brand name medications become available after a patent and other exclusivity rights for the brand name expire. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) must approve all generic versions of a drug and assure that they meet strict standards for quality , strength and purity . The FDA requires that generic equivalent medications contain the same active ingredients and be equivalent in strength and dosage to brand name drugs. Pr eferr ed drugs are FDA approved prescription medications included on the Preferred Drug List developed by CVS Caremark. This list is developed by an independent panel of doctors and pharmacists who ensure the medications are clinically appropriate and cost-ef fective. Selection criteria sources include but are not limited to: peer -reviewed literature; recognized compendia; consensus documents; nationally sanctioned guidelines and other publications of the National Institutes of Health, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality , and other or ganizations or government agencies; drug labeling approved by the FDA; and input from medical specialty practitioners. Non-Pr eferr ed drugs are FDA approved prescription medications that are covered by GEHA, however they are not included on the CVS Caremark Preferred Drug List. Most commonly utilized non-preferred medications have generic or preferred medications available.

Coordinating Benefits with Medicar e and Other Coverage Y ou must tell us if you or a covered family member has coverage under any other health plan or has automobile insurance that pays healthcare expenses without regard to fault. This is called \"double coverage\". When you have double coverage, one plan normally pays its benefits in full as the primary payor and the other plan pays a reduced benefit as the secondary payor . W e, like other insurers, determine which coverage is primary according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' (NAIC) guidelines. For more information on NAIC rules regarding the coordinating of benefits, visit our website at www .geha.com/cob. When we are the primary payor , we will pay benefits described in this brochure. In certain circumstances when we are secondary , we will also take advantage of any provider discount arrangements your primary plan may have. For medical and dental services, we will coordinate benefits to the allowable expense of your primary plan. Refer to Section 5(f) , Coordinating with other drug coverage when you have other primary prescription coverage.If your primary payor requires preauthorization or requires you use designated facilities or provider for benefits to be approved, it is your responsibility to comply with these requirements. In addition you must file the claim to your primary payor within the required time period. If you fail to comply with any of these requirements and benefits are denied by the primary payor , we will pay secondary benefits based on an estimate of what the primary carrier would have paid if you followed their requirements. Please see Section 4, Y our costs for covered services, for more information about how we pay claims. This plan always pays secondary to: Any medical payment, PIP or No-Fault coverage under any automobile policy available to you. Any plan or program which is required by law . Y ou should review your automobile insurance policy to ensure that uncoordinated medical benefits have been chosen so that the automobile insurance policy is the primary payer . When you have other health coverage or auto insurance TRICARE is the healthcare program for eligible dependents of military persons, and retirees of the military . TRICARE includes the CHAMPUS program. CHAMPV A provides health coverage to disabled V eterans and their eligible dependents. If TRICARE or CHAMPV A and this Plan cover you, we pay first. See your TRICARE or CHAMPV A Health Benefits Advisor if you have questions about these programs. Suspended FEHB coverage to enr oll in TRICARE or CHAMPV A: If you are an annuitant or former spouse, you can suspend your FEHB coverage to enroll in one of these programs, eliminating your FEHB premium. (OPM does not contribute to any applicable plan premiums.) For information on suspending your FEHB enrollment, contact your retirement of fice. If you later want to re-enroll in the FEHB Program, generally you may do so only at the next Open Season unless you involuntarily lose coverage under TRICARE or CHAMPV A. TRICARE and CHAMPV A W e do not cover services that: Y ou (or a covered family member) need because of a workplace-related illness or injury that the Of fice of W orkers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) or a similar federal or state agency determines they must provide; or W orkers' Compensation 106 2022 GEHA Benefit Plan Section 9 OWCP or a similar agency pays for through a third-party injury settlement or other similar proceeding that is based on a claim you filed under OWCP or similar laws. Once OWCP or similar agency pays its maximum benefits for your treatment, we will cover your care. When you have this Plan and Medicaid, we pay first. Suspended FEHB coverage to enr oll in Medicaid or a similar State-sponsor ed pr ogram of medical assistance: If you are an annuitant or former spouse, you can suspend your FEHB coverage to enroll in one of these state programs, eliminating your FEHB premium. For information on suspending your FEHB enrollment, contact your retirement of fice. If you later want to re-enroll in the FEHB Program, generally you may do so only at the next Open Season unless you involuntarily lose coverage under the st ate program. Medicaid W e do not cover services and supplies when a local, state, or f ederal government agency directly or indirectly pays for them. When other Government agencies ar e r esponsible for your car e If GEHA pays benefits for an illness or injury for which you accrue a right of action, are entitled to compensation, or receive a settlement, judgment, or recovery from another party , you must agree to the provisions below . All GEHA benefit payments in these circumstances are a condition of and a limitation on the nature, provision, or extent of coverage or benefits under the Plan, and remain subject to all of our contractual benefit limitations, exclusions, and maximums. By accepting these conditional benefits, you agree to the following: Y ou or your representative must contact GEHA ' s Subrogation V endor , The Rawlings Company , LLC, at 855-967-6609 as soon as possible after the event(s) that resulted in the illness or injury , and provide all requested information, including prompt disclosure of the terms of all settlements, judgments, or other recoveries. Y ou must sign any releases GEHA requires to obtain information about any claim(s) for compensation from other sources you may have. Y ou must include all benefits paid by GEHA in any claim for compensation you or your representative assert against any tortfeasor , insurer , or other party for the injury or illness, and assign all proceeds recovered from any party , including your own and/or other insurance, to GEHA for up to the amount of the benefits paid. When benefits are payable under the Plan in relation to the illness or injury , GEHA may , at its option: Enforce its right of subrogation, that is, take over your right to receive payments from other parties. Y ou will transfer to GEHA any rights you or your representative may have to take legal action arising from the illness or injury , and to recover any sums paid on your behalf as a result of that action; or Enforce its right of reimbursement, that is, recover any sums paid on your behalf from any payment(s) you or your representative obtain from other parties. The right of reimbursement is cumulative with and not exclusive of the right of subrogation. Y ou must cooperate in doing what is reasonably necessary to assist us, and you must not take any action that may prejudice these rights of recovery . It is your duty to notify the plan within 30 days of the date when notice is given to any party , including an insurance company or attorney , of your intention to pursue or investigate a claim to recover damages or obtain compensation due to your injury , illness or condition. Y ou and your agents or representatives shall provide all information requested by the plan or its representatives. Y ou shall do nothing to prejudice your FEHB plan' s subrogation or recovery interest or to prejudice the plan' s ability to enforce the terms of this provision. This includes, but is not limited to, refraining from making any settlement or recovery that attempts to reduce or exclude the full cost of all benefits provided by the plan. When others ar e r esponsible for injuries 107 2022 GEHA Benefit Plan Section 9 T o reimburse GEHA on a first priority basis (i.e., before any other party) in full, up to the amount of benefits paid, out of any and all settlements, judgments, or other recoveries that you or your representative obtain, from any source and no matter how characterized, designated, or apportioned (for example, as \"pain and suf fering only\"). GEHA enforces this right of reimbursement by asserting a lien against any and all recoveries obtained, including, but not limited to, first party Medpay , Personal Injury Protection, No-Fault coverage, Third-Party liability coverage, Uninsured and Underinsured coverage, personal liability umbrella coverage, and a workers compensation program or insurance policy . GEHA ' s lien consists of the total benefits paid to diagnose or treat the illness or injury . GEHA ' s lien applies first, regardless of the \"make whole\" and \"common fund\" doctrines. Y our plan is not required to participate in or pay court costs or attorney fees to any attorney hired by you to pursue your damage claims. GEHA ' s lien extends to all expenses incurred prior to the settlement or judgment date, even if those expenses were not submitted to GEHA for payment at the time you reimbursed GEHA. The lien remains your obligation until it is satisfied in full. Failure to refund GEHA or cooperate with our recovery ef forts may result in an overpayment that can be collected from you. The provisions of this section apply to all current or former plan participants and also to the parents, guardian, or other representative of a dependent child who incurs claims and is or has been covered by the plan. The plan' s right to recover (whether by subrogation or reimbursement) shall apply to the personal representative of your estate, heirs or beneficiaries, administrators, legal representatives, successors, assignees, minors, and incompetent or disabled persons. \"Y ou\" or \"your\" includes anyone on whose behalf the plan pays benefits. No adult covered person hereunder may assign any rights that it may have to recover medical expenses from any tortfeasor or other person or entity to any minor child or children of said adult covered person without the prior express written consent of the plan. Some FEHB plans already cover some dental and vision services. When you are covered by more than one vision/dental plan, coverage provided under your FEHB plan remains as your primary coverage. FEDVIP coverage pays secondary to that coverage. When you enroll in a dental and/or vision plan by phone at 877-888-3337, TTY 877-889-5680 you will be asked to provide information on your FEHB plan so that your plans can coordinate benefits. Providing your FEHB information may reduce your out-of-pocket cost. When you have Federal Employees Dental and V ision Insurance Plan (FEDVIP) An approved clinical trial includes a phase I, phase II, phase III, or phase IV clinical trial that is conducted in relation to the prevention, detection, or treatment of cancer or other life-threatening disease or condition, and is either Federally-funded; conducted under an investigational new drug application reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA); or is a drug trial that is exempt from the requirement of an investigational new drug application. If you are a participant in a clinical trial, this health plan will provide related care as follows, if it is not provided by the clinical trial: Routine care costs - costs for routine services such as doctor visits, lab tests, X- rays and scans, and hospitalizations related to treating the patient' s condition, whether the patient is in a clinical trial or is receiving standard therapy . These costs are covered by this Plan. Extra care costs - costs related to taking part in a clinical trial such as additional tests that a patient may need as part of the trial, but not as part of the patient' s routine care. This Plan does not cover these costs. Clinical trials 108 2022 GEHA Benefit Plan Section 9 Research costs - costs related to conducting the clinical trial such as research physician and nurse time, analysis of results, and clinical tests performed only for research purposes. These costs are generally covered by the clinical trials. This Plan does not cover these costs.

When you have Medicar e The Original Medicare Plan (Original Medicare) is available everywhere in the United States. It is the way everyone used to get Medicare benefits and is the way most people get their Medicare Part A and Part B benefits now . Y ou may go to any doctor , specialist, or hospital that accepts Medicare. The Original Medicare Plan pays its share and you pay your share. All physicians and other providers are required by law to file claims directly to Medicare for members with Medicare Part B, when Medicare is primary .

Claims pr ocess when you have the Original Medicar e Plan - Y ou will probably not need to file a claim form when you have both our Plan and the Original Medicare Plan. When we are the primary payor , we process the claim first. When Original Medicare is the primary payor , Medicare processes your claim first. In most cases, your claim will be coordinated automatically and we will then provide secondary benefits for covered char ges.

You must tell us if you or a covered family member has Medicare coverage, and let us obtain information about services denied or paid under Medicare if we ask. You must also tell us about other coverage you or your covered family members may have, as this coverage may affect the primary/secondary status of this Plan and Medicare. T ell us about your Medicar e coverage 1 10 2022 GEHA Benefit Plan Section 9 If you are enrolled in Medicare Part B, a physician may ask you to sign a private contract agreeing that you can be billed directly for services ordinarily covered by Original Medicare. Should you sign an agreement, Medicare will not pay any portion of the char ges, and we will not increase our payment. Regardless of whether the physician requires you to sign an agreement, we will still limit our payment to the coinsurance amount we would have paid after Original Medicare' s payment based on our Plan allowable and the type of service you receive. Y ou may be responsible for paying the dif ference between the billed amount and the amount we paid . Private contract with your physician If you are eligible for Medicare, you may choose to enroll in and get your Medicare benefits from a Medicare Advantage plan. These are private healthcare choices (like HMOs and regional PPOs) in some areas of the country . T o learn more about Medicare Advantage plans, contact Medicare at 800-MEDICARE (800-633-4227), (TTY : 877-486-2048) or at www .medicare.gov . If you enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan, the following options are available to you: This Plan and another plan' s Medicar e Advantage plan: Y ou may enroll in another plan' s Medicare Advantage plan and also remain enrolled in our FEHB plan. W e will still provide benefits when your Medicare Advantage plan is primary , even out of the Medicare Advantage plan' s network and/or service area (if you use our Plan providers). However , if you do go outside the Medicare Advantage plan' s network and/or service area , we will not waive any of our copayments, coinsurance, or deductibles. If you enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan, tell us. W e will need to know whether you are in the Original Medicare Plan or in Medicare Advantage plan so we can correctly coordinate benefits with Medicare. Suspended FEHB coverage to enr oll in a Medicar e Advantage plan: If you are an annuitant or former spouse, you can suspend your FEHB coverage to enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan, eliminating your FEHB premium. (OPM does not contribute to your Medicare Advantage plan premium.) For information on suspending your FEHB enrollment, contact your retirement of fice. If you later want to re-enroll in the FEHB Program, generally you may do so only at the next Open Season, unless you involuntarily lose coverage or move out of the Medicare Advantage plan' s service area. Medicar e Advantage (Part C) When we are the primary payor , we process the claim first. If you enroll in Medicare Part D and we are the secondary payor , we will review claims for your prescription drug costs that are not covered by Medicare Part D and consider them for payment under the FEHB plan. Medicar e pr escription drug coverage (Part D) 1 1 1 2022 GEHA Benefit Plan Section 9 Medicare always makes the final determination as to whether they are the primary payor . The following chart illustrates whether Medicare or this Plan should be the primary payor for you according to your employment status and other factors determined by Medicare. It is critical that you tell us if you or a covered family member has Medicare coverage so we can administer these requirements correctly . (Having coverage under mor e than two health plans may change the order of benefits determined on this chart.) Primary Payor Chart A.

Y our physician and hospital must follow Medicare rules and cannot bill you for more than they could bill you if you had Medicare. Y ou and the FEHB benefit from these payment limits. Outpatient hospital care and non-physician based care are not covered by this law; regular Plan benefits apply . The following chart has more information about the limits. If you : are age 65 or over; and do not have Medicare Part A, Part B, or both; and have this Plan as an annuitant or as a former spouse, or as a family member of an annuitant or former spouse; and are not employed in a position that gives FEHB coverage. (Y our employing of fice can tell you if this applies.) Then, for your inpatient hospital car e: The law requires us to base our payment on an amount - the \"equivalent Medicare amount\" - set by Medicare' s rules for what Medicare would pay , not on the actual char ge. Y ou are responsible for your applicable deductibles and coinsurance under this Plan. Y ou are not responsible for any char ges greater than the equivalent Medicare amount; we will show that amount on the Explanation of Benefits (EOB) form that we send you. The law prohibits a hospital from collecting more than the \"equivalent Medicare amount\". When inpatient claims are paid according to a Diagnostic Related Group (DRG) limit (for instance, for admissions of certain retirees who do not have Medicare), we will pay 30% of the total covered amount as room and board char ges and 70% as other char ges and will apply your coinsurance accordingly . And, for your physician car e, the law requires us to base our payment and your coinsurance on: an amount set by Medicare and called the \"Medicare approved amount,\" or the actual char ge if it is lower than the Medicare approved amount. If your physician: Participates with Medicare or accepts Medicare assignment for the claim and is a member of our PPO network, Then you ar e r esponsible for: your deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments. If your physician: Participates with Medicare and is not in our PPO network, Then you ar e r esponsible for: your deductibles, coinsurance, and any balance up to the Medicare approved amount. If your physician: Does not participate with Medicare, Then you ar e r esponsible for: your deductibles, coinsurance, and any balance up to 1 15% of the Medicare approved amount. If your physician: Does not participate with Medicare and is not a member of our PPO network, Then you ar e r esponsible for: your out-of-network deductibles, coinsurance, and any balance up to 1 15% of the Medicare approved amount. 1 13 2022 GEHA Benefit Plan Section 9 If your physician: Opts-out of Medicare via private contract, Then you ar e r esponsible for: your deductibles, coinsurance, copayments, and any balance your physician char ges. It is generally to your financial advantage to use a physician who participates with Medicare. Such physicians are permitted to collect only up to the Medicare approved amount. Physicians who opt-out of Medicar e A physician may have opted-out of Medicare and may or may not ask you to sign a private contract agreeing that you can be billed directly for services ordinarily covered by Original Medicare. This is dif ferent than a non-participating doctor , and we recommend you ask your physician if they have opted-out of Medicare. Should you visit an opt-out physician, the physician will not be limited to 1 15% of the Medicare approved amount. Y ou may be responsible for paying the dif ference between the billed amount and our regular in-network/out-of-network benefits. Our Explanation of Benefits (EOB) form will tell you how much the physician or hospital can collect from you. If your physician or hospital tries to collect more than allowed by law , ask the physician or hospital to reduce the char ges. If you have paid more than allowed, ask for a refund. If you need further assistance, call us. W e limit our payment to an amount that supplements the benefits that Medicare would pay under Medicare Part A (Hospital insurance) and Medicare Part B (Medical insurance), regardless of whether Medicare pays. Note: W e pay our regular benefits for emer gency services to an institutional provider , such as a hospital, that does not participate with Medicare and is not reimbursed by Medicare. W e use the Department of V eterans Af fairs (V A) Medicare-equivalent Remittance Advice (MRA) when the statement is submitted to determine our payment for covered services provided to you if Medicare is primary , when Medicare does not pay the V A facility . If you are covered by Medicare Part B and it is primary , your out-of-pocket costs for services that both Medicare Part B and we cover depend on whether your physician accepts Medicare assignment for the claim. If your physician accepts Medicare assignment, we waive some of your deductibles, copayments and coinsurance for covered char ges. If your physician does not accept Medicare assignment, you pay the dif ference between the \"limiting char ge\" or the physician' s char ge (whichever is less) and our payment combined with Medicare' s payment. It is important to know that a physician who does not accept Medicare assignment may not bill you for more than 1 15% of the amount Medicare bases its payment on, called the \"limiting char ge.\" The Medicare Summary Notice (MSN) that Medicare will send you will have more information about the limiting char ge. If your physician tries to collect more than allowed by law , ask the physician to reduce the char ges. If the physician does not, report the physician to the Medicare carrier that sent you the MSN form. Call us if you need further assistance.

Healthcare coverage that a member or covered dependent is eligible for because of employment by , membership in, or connection with, a particular or ganization or group that provides payment for hospital, medical, dental or other healthcare services or supplies, including extension of any of these benefits through COBRA. Gr oup health coverage A physician or other healthcare professional licensed, accredited, or certified to perform specified health services consistent with state law . Healthcar e pr ofessional The condition of an individual who is unable to conceive or produce conception during a period of one year . Infertility Inpatient care is care rendered to a person who has been admitted to a hospital for bed occupancy for purposes of receiving inpatient hospital services. Generally , a patient is considered an inpatient if formally admitted as an inpatient with the expectation that he or she will remain at least overnight and occupy a bed even if it later develops that the patient can be safely dischar ged or transferred to another hospital and not actually use a hospital bed overnight. See Section 3, How you get care , Covered facilities, for the definition of an Acute Inpatient and Residential T reatment Center . Inpatient car e Often referred to as L TCH or L T AC, these facilities provide services for patients who need extended intensive or critical, hospital-level of care beyond that of the traditional short hospital stay . L TCH's specialize in treating patients who have more than one serious condition yet have the potential to improve with time and care and return to their previous health status. Generally , services are focused on respiratory therapy , head trauma treatment, and pain management. Long-term acute car e W e do not provide benefits for long-term care, regardless of who recommends the care or where it is provided. The Carrier or its delegated medical professionals determine which services are long- term care. A range of services and support provided to meet personal care needs on a long-term basis. While some medical care may be necessary , most of the care provided is not and does not require a licensed caregiver . This encompasses a spectrum of services provided in a variety of settings for people who do not have full independence because of a medical condition, injury , or chronic and/or behavioral illness. Long-term care is often used to provide custodial care as well as instrumental activities of daily living necessary for safety and health. Long-term car e 1 17 2022 GEHA Benefit Plan Section 10 Long-term care is usually custodial care that has lasted for 90 days or more yet can begin prior to 90 days dependent on the member's response to professional intervention. Long-term car e and long-term acute car e ar e not one and the same. See the definition of long-term acute car e for mor e information about those services. Inborn errors of metabolism are rare genetic (inherited) disorders in which the body cannot properly turn food into ener gy . The disorders are usually caused by defects in specific proteins (enzymes) that help break down (metabolize) parts of food. GEHA will cover medical food for a diagnosis of IEM. Medical Food is defined as a food which is recommended by a physician after an evaluation and is intended to provide for the dietary management of a disease or condition that has specific nutritional requirements. GEHA will not cover \"grocery\" food items that can routinely be obtained online or in stores (e.g. gluten-free breads). Medical Foods for Inborn Err ors of Metabolism (IEM) Services, drugs, supplies or equipment provided by a hospital or covered provider of the healthcare services that the Plan determines: Are appropriate to diagnose or treat the patient' s condition, illness or injury; Are consistent with generally accepted standards of medical practice in the United States. - Generally accepted standards of medical practice are based on credible scientific evidence published in peer -reviewed medical literature generally recognized by the relevant medical community , national physician specialty society recommendations and the views of medical practitioners practicing in relevant clinical areas, and any other relevant factors; Are not primarily for the personal comfort or convenience of the patient, the family , or the provider; Are not a part of or associated with the scholastic education or vocational training of the patient; In the case of inpatient care, cannot be provided safely on an outpatient basis or Is not custodial or long-term care (see the Plan's definition on the previous page). The fact that a covered provider has prescribed, recommended, or approved a service, supply , drug or equipment does not, in itself, make it medically necessary . Medical necessity Conditions and diseases listed in the most recent edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) as psychoses, neurotic disorders, or personality disorders; other nonpsychotic mental disorders listed in the ICD, to be determined by the Plan; or disorders listed in the ICD requiring treatment for misuse or dependence upon substances such as alcohol, narcotics, or hallucinogens. Precertification is required for all of the following services and must be provided by a covered facility or covered provider as defined in section 3: How you get care. Inpatient Mental Health: Acute Care Hospital: See Section 3 under Covered Facilities. Residential T reatment Center (R TC): See Section 3 under Covered Facilities. Intensive Day T r eatment: Intensive day treatment programs are outpatient services that must be rendered on an outpatient basis. Regardless of where services are rendered, the provider and/or the facility , must be licensed to provide intensive day mental health and/or substance use treatment and must meet GEHA's definition of a covered provider in Section 3. GEHA does not cover room and board during intensive day treatment programs. Under the direction of a physician, services must be provided for at least two hours per day and may include group, individual, and family therapy along with psychoeducational services and adjunctive psychiatric medication management. Mental health/ substance use disorder 1 18 2022 GEHA Benefit Plan Section 10 - Partial Hospitalization Program (PHP): facility based outpatient treatment program for mental health and/or substance use disorder conditions not requiring 24-hour care. T wenty or more hours of care per week is usually delivered at a minimum of four hours a day , five days a week. T ime frames and frequency will vary based on condition, severity , and individual treatment plan. - Intensive Outpatient (IOP): A comprehensive, structured outpatient treatment program that includes extended periods of individual or group therapy sessions for mental health and/or substance use disorder conditions. It is an intermediate level of care between traditional outpatient therapy and partial hospitalization, delivered in an outpatient facility or outpatient professional of fice setting. Nine or more hours of care per week is usually delivered at a minimum of three hours a day , three days a week. T ime frames and frequency will vary based on condition, severity , and individual treatment plan. Common, non-emer gent conditions. Examples of common conditions include sinus problems, rashes, aller gies, cold and flu symptoms, etc. Minor acute conditions Federal or State policies that bar healthcare providers from char ging patients for care that is attributable to certain avoidable complications or errors, such as wrong site sur gery . Never event policies Observation care is a well-defined set of specific, clinically appropriate services, which include ongoing short-term treatment, assessment, and reassessment, that are furnished while a decision is being made regarding whether patients will require further treatment as hospital inpatients or if they are able to be dischar ged from the hospital. Observation services are commonly ordered for patients who present to the emer gency department and who then require a significant period of treatment or monitoring in order to make a decision concerning their admission or dischar ge. The Plan provides outpatient hospital benefits for observation care. If you are in the hospital for more than a few hours, confirm with your physician whether your stay is inpatient or outpatient so that you are aware of how your hospital claim will be processed. Observation car e Our Plan allowance is the amount we use to determine our payment and your coinsurance for covered services. Fee-for -service plans determine their allowances in dif ferent ways. W e determine our Plan allowance as follows: PPO pr oviders: Our PPO allowances are negotiated with each provider who participates in the network. PPO allowances may be based on a standard reduction or on a negotiated fee schedule. For these allowances, the PPO provider has agreed to accept the negotiated reduction and you are not responsible for this discounted amount. In these instances, the benefit paid plus your coinsurance equals payment in full. Non-PPO pr oviders: T o determine our non-PPO Plan allowance, we must first be provided an itemized bill that includes your diagnosis, the services or supplies you received, and the provider ' s char ge for each, using the same types of standard codes, descriptions and other information required for processing by public healthcare plans like Medicare. If we are not provided the itemization of the services or supplies you received, we will assume they were equivalent to the level and extent of services and supplies typically provided by the providers or facilities most commonly used to treat other Plan members with the same principal diagnosis as yours. W e will base these equivalent services on claims submitted to the Plan by providers in the same geographic region or a combination of similar geographic regions across the United States. Based on the itemization of services or supplies you received, we will determine the amount of the maximum non-PPO Plan allowance by applying the following rules, in order: 1. For emer gent services, air ambulance, and services performed by non-PPO providers rendered at PPO facilities, the Plan allowance will be the \"recognized amount\" as defined by the federal law . Plan allowance 1 19 2022 GEHA Benefit Plan Section 10 2. W e consult standard industry guides, such as national databases of prevailing health care char ges from F AIR Health or another identified data source, that are available for our use in a given state or geographic area. After the data supplier removes outliers from the claim data they collect, they group the remaining data by percentiles. W e use the 70th percentile. This means that out of every 100 reports remaining after outliers were removed, 30 char ges billed may be more, but 70 char ges will be the allowed amount or less. 3. For services or supplies obtained in a state or geographic area where the above data source is unavailable for our use, and also for dialysis centers and outpatient dialysis performed at a hospital our non-PPO Plan allowance is two times the Medicare participating provider allowance for the service or supply in the geographic area in which it was performed or obtained. This Medicare-based allowance is not used for those services where Medicare sets a fixed national payment amount that does not vary geographically (such as blood draws). Medicare fee schedule information for physician services may be obtained at www .cms.hhs.gov/PFSlookup . Note: Labs drawn during the week of dialysis treatments and drugs provided on the day of dialysis are part of the bundled dialysis payment. 4. Some Plan allowances may be submitted to medical consultants who recommend allowances based on standard industry relative value guidelines. For services or supplies for which Medicare does not provide an allowance amount, we may use the current fee schedule used by the Federal Of fice of W orkers' Compensation Programs (OWCP). OWCP fee schedule information may be obtained at www .dol.gov/OWCP/regs/feeschedule/fee.htm . For services or supplies that do not have a value currently established by public healthcare plans such as Medicare or Medicaid, or for implantable devices and sur gical hardware, we may use medical consultants to determine an appropriate allowance. W e may also conduct independent studies to determine the usual cost of a service or supply in a geographic area, or to establish allowances for services or supplies provided outside the United States. Non-PPO Plan allowance amounts determined according to these guidelines include, but are not limited to, hospitals, ambulance, ambulatory sur gery centers, dialysis centers, sur gery , doctor ' s services, physical therapy , occupational therapy , speech therapy , lab testing and X-ray expenses, implantable devices and sur gical hardware; and under the Standard Option, diagnostic and preventive dental services. For more information about the source of the data we are currently using you may call us at 800-821-6136. Plan allowance for prescription drugs is determined using A verage Wholesale Price or other industry-standard reference price data. Char ges for some Plan allowances are stated in this brochure. These include limited benefits such as routine dental care. If we negotiate a reduced fee amount on an individual claim for services or supplies which is lower than the Plan allowance, covered benefits will be limited to the negotiated amount. Y our coinsurance will be based on the reduced fee amount. If you choose to use a provider other than the one we negotiated a reduction with, you will be responsible for the dif ference in these amounts. T o estimate our maximum Plan allowance for a non-PPO provider before you receive services from them, call us at 800-821-6136.

Any claims that are not pre-service claims. In other words, post-service claims are those claims where treatment has been performed and the claims have been sent to us in order to apply for benefits. Post-service claims 120 2022 GEHA Benefit Plan Section 10 Those claims 1) that require precertification or preauthorization and 2) where failure to obtain precertification or preauthorization results in a reduction of benefits.
