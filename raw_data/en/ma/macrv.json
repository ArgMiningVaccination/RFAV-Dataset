It is used to relieve nasal discharge, sneezing, tearing, headaches and fever associated with colds and flu-like conditions. This medication should not be used in the following cases: This medicine can cause acute [glaucoma] in susceptible persons: red, hard and painful eyes, with blurred vision. An emergency consultation with an ophthalmologist is necessary. Because of the presence of an [antihistamine] with [sedative] and [atropine] [properties] , precautions are necessary in the elderly, especially in cases of chronic constipation, [prostatic adenoma] , tendency to [dizziness] or drops in tension. Paracetamol is present alone or in combination with other substances in many medicines: make sure not to take several medicines containing paracetamol simultaneously, as a joint dose leads to a risk of [overdosage,] which can be toxic to the liver. Avoid alcoholic beverages: increased risk of drowsiness. This medication may induce somnolence, sometimes intense in some people. This drowsiness can be increased by taking [alcohol] or other [sedative] drugs. Driving and using hazardous machines are not recommended, especially within hours of taking the medication. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any other medicines that have [atropine] or [sedative] effects (tranquillizers, sleeping pills, some cough or pain medications containing [opioids] , [antidepressants] , [neuroleptics,] etc.). If treated with an oral [anticoagulant] and paracetamol at maximum doses (4 g / day) for at least 4 days, increased monitoring of anticoagulant therapy may be required. The effect of this medication during pregnancy or lactation is not well known. As a precaution, it should not be used in pregnant women or nursing mothers. The pellets must be swallowed after dissolving in half a glass of water, hot or cold. An interval of 4 hours must be observed between the sockets. In case of [renal insufficiency] , observe an interval of 8 hours between the catch. Usual dosage: - Adult and child over 15 years: 1 sachet, 2 or 3 times a day. This treatment has no anti-infectious effect. If the condition persists for more than 5 days, consult your doctor. This medicinal product may be freely available in certain pharmacies; nevertheless, do not hesitate to ask your pharmacist for advice. Drowsiness, especially at the beginning of treatment. [Atropine] effects: constipation, of ideas the elderly Rarely: agitation, nervousness, insomnia, [accommodation ] the eye, allowing clear vision close up. Presbyopia is the most common disorder of accommodation; some drugs such as atropine may cause passenger accommodation problems. [adenoma of the prostate ] Increase in the volume of the prostate gland located under the bladder of the man. This increase in volume is benign, has no relationship to cancer, but can interfere with the passage of urine into the urethra through the gland. Symptoms that suggest the presence of a prostate adenoma are: - difficulty urinating (slowness, weakness of the spray); - the need to get up several times at night to urinate; - urges to urinate imperiously and difficult to control. Certain drugs, especially atropinic drugs, may have the undesirable effect of aggravating the discomfort and may lead to a total blockage of the evacuation of the bladder. They are therefore contraindicated or should be used cautiously in men with the symptoms described above. [alcohol ] General name designating a family of substances that have the property of being able to be mixed with water and fatty substances. The most common alcohol is ethyl alcohol (ethanol), but there are many other alcohols: methanol, butanol, etc. The degree of alcoholic solution corresponds to the volume of pure alcohol present in 100 ml of solution, knowing that 1 glass of wine or 1/2 of beer (25 cl) contains about 8 g of alcohol. When alcohol is used as an antiseptic, an unpleasant odor denaturant is often added to prevent drinking. Contrary to a widespread belief, alcohol at 70o (or even at 60o) is a better antiseptic than alcohol at 90o. [analgesic ] Medication that works against pain. Analgesics act either directly on the centers of pain in the brain or by blocking the transmission of pain to the brain. Synonym: analgesic. [anticoagulant ] Medication that prevents blood from coagulating and therefore prevents clots from forming in the blood vessels. Anticoagulants are used to treat or prevent phlebitis, pulmonary embolism, certain infarcts. They also prevent the formation of clots in the heart during rhythm disorders such as atrial fibrillation or in the case of an artificial heart valve. There are two main types of anticoagulants: - oral anticoagulants, which block the action of vitamin K (antivitamin K, or AVK) and whose effectiveness is controlled by a blood test: INR (formerly TP); - injectable anticoagulants derived from heparin, the efficacy of which can be controlled by the blood assay of anti-Xa activity, Howell's Time (TH) or Cephalin Kaolin Time (TCK) depending on the products used. A regular dosage of blood platelets is necessary throughout the life of a heparin derivative. [antidepressants ] Medication that works against depression. Some antidepressants are also used to combat obsessive-compulsive disorder, generalized anxiety, certain rebellious pain, enuresis, etc. Depending on their mode of action and adverse effects, antidepressants are divided into different families: imipraminic antidepressants, selective or non-selective MAOIs. Finally, other antidepressants do not belong to any of these families, because they possess original properties. The mode of action of antidepressants has two main aspects: the relief of moral suffering and the fight against inhibition which removes all will to action from the depressed. There may be a time lag between these two effects: moral suffering may persist, while the capacity for action reappears. During this short period, the risk of suicide in some depressed people can be increased. The physician takes it into account in its prescription (possible association with a tranquillizer) and it must imperatively be respected. [antihistamine ] Medication that opposes different effects of histamine. Two main types exist: antihistamines type H1 (antiallergic) and type Some antihistamines of type H1 are sedative, others do not alter vigilance. [antipyretic ] Medication used to lower the body temperature during bouts of fever. [atropine ] Medication with effects similar to those of atropine. Atropinics fight spasms and diarrhea. Adverse effects of atropinic drugs include: thickening of bronchial secretions, dry mouth and membranes, constipation, risk of urine blockage and acute glaucoma in susceptible persons, accommodation disorders, abnormal sensitivity to light by dilation of the pupil. Taking several atropine medicines increases the risk of adverse effects. In the event of overdose or accidental ingestion, the following signs may also appear: red and warm skin, fever, acceleration of breathing, fall or, on the contrary, elevated blood pressure, agitation, hallucinations, poor coordination of movements. Emergency care should be given to your doctor or, if not available, call 15, 112 or an emergency medical service. In addition to atropine and its derivatives, other drugs have atropine effects: imipraminic antidepressants, some antihistamines, antispasmodics, antiparkinsonian and neuroleptic. [glaucoma ] Disease characterized by increased pressure of the fluids contained in the eye (intraocular hypertension). This general term covers two totally different affections: - Open angle glaucoma or chronic glaucoma is the most frequent; it is generally symptom-free, detected by the measurement of intraocular tension in the ophthalmologist. It does not cause acute seizures, and treatment relies primarily on beta-blocking eye drops. People with open-angle glaucoma should not use cortisone derivatives without prior ophthalmologic advice. - Closed-angle glaucoma or acute glaucoma is more rare. Between seizures, intraocular tension is normal. But the inadvertent use of atropine medicines (especially eye drops) causes an acute crisis of intraocular hypertension which can permanently damage the retina in a few hours. It is an ophthalmological emergency that is recognized by a brutally red eye, horribly painful, hard as a glass ball, and whose vision becomes blurred. The angle in question in these two affections is the irido-corneal angle. It is indeed between the iris and the cornea that is located the system of evacuation of the liquids of the eye. A slightly open (closed) angle exposes a total obstruction of the evacuation system. This obstruction can occur when the iris is opened to the maximum (mydriasis) under the effect of an atropinic drug: the iris then comes to be attached to the cornea. Contraindications for atropine medicines are limited to those who have already had closed-angle glaucoma or who have been detected by an ophthalmologist. Those who suffer from chronic open-angle glaucoma are not affected by these contraindications. [Orthostatic hypotension ] Reduced blood pressure when changing from elongated to standing. Due mostly to drugs, orthostatic hypotension results in dizziness with risk of fall, especially in the elderly. These disturbances can be prevented by avoiding sudden changes of position: sit for a few moments at the edge of the bed before standing up, slowly rising from a seat with a support before moving. Wearing compression stockings, which prevents blood from flowing back to the legs while standing, is also used to treat orthostatic hypotension. [Hepatic insufficiency ] Inability of the liver to perform its function, which is essentially the elimination of some waste, but also the synthesis of many biological substances essential to the body: albumin, cholesterol and coagulation factors (vitamin K, etc.). [renal failure ] Inability of the kidneys to eliminate waste or medicinal substances. Advanced renal insufficiency does not necessarily result in a decrease in the amount of urine excreted. Only a blood test and creatinine dosage may reveal this disease. [neuroleptics ] Family of medicines used in the treatment of certain nervous disorders or various symptoms: digestive disorders, menopausal disorders, etc. [blood count ] The count measures the number of red blood cells (red blood cells), white blood cells (leukocytes) and platelets in the blood. The blood formula specifies the percentage of different white chemical family that includes opium and its derivatives. In addition to drugs such as opium or heroin, the opiate family includes morphine (strong analgesic), codeine (antitussive and analgesic) and many other substances. [palpitations ] Abnormal perception of irregular heartbeat. [phenylketonuria ] An inherited disease that is characterized by the absence of an enzyme and that leads to the accumulation in the blood of a toxic product. Screening is systematic at birth. Treatment is based on a specific diet during early childhood. [allergic reaction ] Reaction due to hypersensitivity of the organism to a drug. Allergic reactions can take a wide variety of aspects: urticaria, angioedema, eczema, eruption of pimples resembling measles, etc. Anaphylactic shock is a generalized allergic reaction that causes discomfort due to a sudden drop in blood pressure. [sedative ] - Quiets, calms down. - Medication belonging families: anxiolytics, antihypertensives. A sedative can be responsible for drowsiness and increase the effects of alcohol. [overdose ] Excessive intake of a drug may result in an increase in the intensity of adverse effects or even in the development of specific adverse effects. This overdose may result from accidental or voluntary poisoning for suicide, so consult your local Poison Control Center (listed in the appendix to the book). However, in most cases, overdose is the result of an error in the understanding of the prescription, or the search for an increase in efficacy by exceeding the recommended dosage. Finally, untimely self-medication may lead to excessive absorption of the same substance contained in different drugs. Some drugs are particularly prone to this risk because they are (wrongly) considered to be harmless: vitamins A and D, aspirin, etc. Stopping or decreasing drug intake helps to remove the disorders associated with an overdose. [dizziness ] Symptom that can mean an impression of loss of balance (common sense) or, more strictly, a sense of rotation on oneself or the environment (medical sense). [vitamin ] An essential ingredient for the growth and proper functioning of the body. Vitamin requirements are normally covered by a varied diet. In developed countries, only vitamin D deficiency, in the young child or the old man who is exposed to the sun, justifies systematic supplementation. Superior intake, especially with medicines, can lead to overdose and various disorders (mainly vitamins A and D).

[Other] ADVICE / HEALTH EDUCATION DECONGESTING FOR SYSTEMIC USE This medication is used in the treatment of stuffy nose sensation and headache and / or fever during colds in adults and children over 15 years of age. The common cold is a very common acute benign infection that affects the nasal mucosa (inner lining of the nose). This mucous membrane secretes a liquid whose role is to constantly moisten the inspired air and to fight against the infectious agents. When this mucous membrane is irritated, it swells and increases its usual fluid secretion, so that the nose \"flows\". In order to limit the onset of symptoms, respect the following hygiene rules as much as possible: \u00b7 Wash hands regularly, especially before meals or during preparation. \u00b7 cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze; \u00b7 blow your nose often with disposable handkerchiefs (not to recontaminate) and dispose of them in a trash can immediately after use and then wash your hands; \u00b7 when using a nasal solution, avoid using the same nosepiece for all family members. \u00b7 avoid visiting a young child and her newborn, an elderly person, or a person treated with immunosuppressive drugs (corticosteroids, medicines for blood or cancer). In these cases, wearing the mask is recommended. For your comfort: \u00b7 drink enough; \u00b7 moisten the nasal mucosa with suitable washing solutions (physiological saline, sprays of thermal water or sea water). Avoid using the same nosepiece for the whole family. \u00b7 avoid smoking or breathing the smoke of others, \u00b7 sleeping the raised head to improve the airflow in the nostrils and sleeping enough; \u00b7 protect the skin of the upper lip and nostrils by a cream if the repetition of the flies tends to irritate the skin; \u00b7 avoid air conditioners that dehumidify the air and dry the nasal mucous membranes, the ideal room temperature should be around 18-20 \u00b0 C; \u00b7 aerate the parts regularly. \"WHAT TO DO IN THE EVENT OF FEVER\": The normal temperature of the body varies from one individual to another and is between 36 \u00b0 5 and 37 \u00b0 5. An increase of more than 0 \u00b0 8 is considered a fever. In adults: If the disorders that it causes are too troublesome, you can take this medicine which contains paracat\u00e9mol in the dosages indicated. With this medication, the fever should drop rapidly. Nevertheless : \u00b7 if other signs appear (such as a rash), \u00b7 if the temperature persists for more than 3 days or if it worsens, \u00b7 if the headache becomes violent, or in case of vomiting, CONSULT YOUR DOCTOR IMMEDIATELY. \"WHAT TO DO IN CASE OF PAIN\": \u00b7 In the absence of improvement after 5 days of treatment, \u00b7 If the pain returns regularly, \u00b7 If accompanied by fever, \u00b7 If she wakes you up at night, CONSULT YOUR DOCTOR IMMEDIATELY.
