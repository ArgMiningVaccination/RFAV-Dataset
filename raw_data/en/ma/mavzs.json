Finally found a product that does not give me itchy dry spots on my scalp and yet still holds my hair (short to medium length) all day long. The shine and the scent (good but not overpowering) are a nice bonus I have four of SR's pomades, Northern Lights, Crystal Lake, Gray Ghost and Loyal Sea and each is different but I have to say I reach for Crystal Lake more often. It is so easy to use and it just pushes every button. Must try. as my hair started to thin i needed something to hold it in place while looking natural. Crystal Lake has worked better than any other products i have tried and makes my hair look fuller. Good stuff. I got this recently to see if it still performs the same after the rebranding. The last time I tried Crystal Lake was a few years ago, and this still holds up to the standards. Although I would like more hold, you can't fault it because it is now labeled as a medium. It is a good medium with nice scent and nourishing feeling. Would buy again if I wanted a medium. "}
