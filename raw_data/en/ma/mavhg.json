Men were more likely to be smokers at 18% versus 14.3% for women. Arizonans who reported excellent health over past 5 to 7 years were similar with a range of (19.1% - 24.4%) The proportion of Arizonans consuming five or more servings of fruits and vegetable has slightly increased from 23.5% in 2008 to 24.1% in 2009. Respondents with activity limitations and requirements for special equipment decreased slightly from 7.7% in 2008 to 6.3% in 2009. Asthma was reported at 15.5%, the highest in eight years. Thirty-two percent of those in the category: \"unable to work,\" reported having asthma. Nearly 70% of adults 65 years and older received an influenza vaccination in 2009. Arizona Respondents who reported being uninsured improved from 17.9% in 2008 to 15% in 2009. Arizona consistently has a significant proportion of its population (14.1%) who can not afford needed health care.

A. BACKGROUND The Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS) has participated in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) since 1982, through a cooperative agreement with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The BRFSS is an ongoing data collection system for gathering information on adult health-related behaviors of non-institutionalized residents 18 years of age and older. The purpose of the BRFSS is to provide data that can be used to plan, implement and monitor health promotion and disease prevention efforts in Arizona. B. SAMPLING DESIGN The Arizona BRFSS is a random sample telephone survey, using disproportionate stratified sampling, random digit dialing and a Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) system. The survey has the potential to represent 96.3 percent of all households in Arizona (i.e., those who have land-line telephones rather than cellular phones according to Arizona Department of Economic Security data for the year 2000, the latest year available). A sample size of 5 ,475 interviews over a 12-month period was selected to achieve an acceptable 95 percent confidence interval of \u00b13 percent on risk factor prevalence estimates of the adult population. This means that the estimated prevalenc e of a given risk factor can be reliably projected across the total population of Arizona residents. Prevalence estimates of individual demographic variables, especially those that yield smaller sample sizes, do not achieve the same level of accuracy as the total sample. A demographic profile of the Arizona population surveyed is reported in Appendix I: 2009 Arizona Respondent Profile. C. QUESTIONNAIRE The questionnaire, designed through cooperative agreements with the CDC, was divided into three sectio ns: Core, Optional Modules, and State-Added questions. The Core section contained questions on health risk behaviors and demographic information; the next section contained optional modules: PreDiabetes, Diabetes, Actions to Control High Blood Pressure, Heart Attack and Stroke, Shingles and Mental Illness and Stigma. The last section contained State-added questions consisting of: Cancer survivorship, Food Assistance Program Participation, and Tobacco items. D. BRFSS Protocol The ADHS has contracted with a private survey research firm since August 2000 to contact randomly selected Arizona residences from 9 A.M. until 9 P.M. weekdays, from 11 A.M. until 7 P.M. Saturdays, and 11 A.M. until 7 P.M. Sundays. All telephone numbers released in each month's sa mple received at least 15 attempts over a minimum 14 day period, including at least three attempts during weekends, three attempts during weekday evening and three attempts during the daytime weekday. Furthermore selected respondents who were not able to complete the interview at the time of selection received a minimum of 10 callbacks during the interview period. After a residence had been contacted, one adult (18 years of age or older) was randomly selected from all adults residing in the household to be interviewed. METHODS METHODS 3 METHODS ( Cont .) E. DATA ANALYSIS The collected data were compiled and weighted by the CDC. Weighted counts were based on the Arizona population to accurately reflect the population demographics. The weighting factor considered the number of adults and telephone lines in the household, cluster size, stratum size, and age/race/sex distribution of the general population. The weighting formula is described in the 2009 BRFSS Weighting Formula at the end of this report. All analyses presented are based upon cell size counts of at least eight cases. The demographic information that was collected and presented in these results includes sex, age, education, household income, race, and ethnicity. Comparisons between responses within demographic categories were analyzed for statistical significance at the alpha = .05 level. Throughout the report, statistical difference is noted when analysis provides 95 percent confidence that the categories described are different. 4 Asthma Respondents who reported a doctor told them they had asthma. Binge Drinking Respondents who reported having five or more drinks on an occasion, one or more times in the past month. Cancer Respondents who reported having been told by a doctor, nurse, or other health care professional that they had cancer. In addition, Cancer survivors reported on the type of cancer they had and if they were in clinical trials. Cardiovascular Disease Respondents who reported a doctor told them they had a heart attack, angina, or stroke. Caregiver Caregivers provide assistance to someone who is, in some degree incapacitated and needs help. The responses from the caregiver module can then be paired with information from the main BRFSS questionnaire, which allow for additional information about the health and well-being of caregivers. Cholesterol Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that your body needs. But, when you have too much in your blood, it can build up on the walls of your arteries. This can lead to heart disease and stroke. COPD Respondents who reported a doctor told them they had emphysema or chronic bronchitis. Current Smoking Respondents who reported smoking 100 cigarettes during their lifetime and who smoke now (regularly or irregularly). Diabetes Respondents who reported a doctor told them they had diabetes. Influenza Vaccination Respondents 65 years or older who reported not receiving a flu shot in the past 12 months. Folic Acid Awareness Female respondents 18 to 44 years of age who reported a reason other than preventing birth defects as the reason experts recommend that women take folic acid. RISK FACTORS/CHRONIC DI SEASE TERM GLOSSARY 5 Fruits/Vegetables Respondent s who reported that they consumed fewer than five servings of fruits and vegetables daily. Health Care Coverage Respondents who reported that they did not have health care coverage. Heavy Drinking A dult men having more than two drinks per day and adult women having more than one drink per day . Limited Activities Respondents who reported they were limited in any activities due to any impairment or health problems. No Leisure -Time Activity Respondents who reported that they did not participate in physica l activity in the past month outside of normal work -related activities. Obese Respondents with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30.0 to 99.8. BMI is weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared (W/H\u00b2). Overweight Respondents with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 25.0 to 29.9. Respondent Arizona residents 18 years of age or older. In some cases various subset(s) of this group may be used. Seatbelt Use Respondents who reported that they \"sometimes\", \"seldom\", or \"never\" wear seat belts when driving or riding in a car . Shingles Shingles, also called herpes zoster or zoster, is a painful skin rash caused by the varicella zoster virus (VZV). VZV is the same virus that causes chickenpox. After a person recovers from chickenpox, the virus stays in the body. Usually the virus does not cause any problems; however, the virus can reappear years later, causing shingles. Herpes zoster is not caused by the same virus that causes genital herpes, a sexually transmitted disease. Special Equipment Respondents reported having a health problem or impairment that required special equipment. RISK FACTORS/CHRONIC DISEASE TERM GLOSSARY (Cont.) 6 SELF-REPORTED HEALTH STATUS AND LIFE SATISFACTION THIS PAGE IS INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK Health -related quality of life (HRQOL) related questions about perceived physical and mental health and function have developed into an important part of health surveillance and are generally considered valid indicators of service needs and intervention outcomes. Self -assessed health status has proved a more dominant predictor of mortality and morbidity than many objective measures of health. 1 HRQOL measures make it feasible to scientifically demonstrate the effect quality of life has on health, going well beyond the old paradigm that was restricted to what can be viewed under a microscope.2 Survey Question: Would you say that in general your 33.0% 21.3%31.0% 10.2% 4.2% Figure 1a . 2009 Arizona and national BRFSS respondents' self -reported physical health status When compared to the median value of all states in the nation, Arizona is not much different.

In each year from 2000 to 2009 , the proportion of respondents who reported their health status as excellent was higher in Arizona compared to the nation with the one exception of 2008. The proportion of Arizonans who assessed their health status as poor decreased f rom 4.9% in 2000 to 4.2% in 2009 . We see a similar reduction in those who reported excellent health from 25.4% to 21.3%. Male Female Poor 5.0% to the 2009 BRFSS (Table 1a below), 14.5 percent of respondents reported their health was fair or poor. Some of the highlights of this table include: Poor health is reported more frequently as age increases. Looking at marital status, the separated , divorced, and widowed group reported having poor health. There is a gradient in response associate with income. The lower the income the higher the percentage reporting poor health. Native American and Hispanic respondents were much more likely to report poor health. Table 1a .

Nevertheless, it is only relatively recently that subjective measures of well -being have begun to be taken seriously outside academia. People with positive self -perceptions also tend to live longer than those who regard themselves more negatively. As well as being valid, self -reports of life satisfaction seem to be reliable. In other words, people tend to give the same patterns of response over time, and when slightly different question wordings are used. Whilst on the individual level, day - to-day changes in happiness are of interest, at a policy level it is overall satisfaction that gives the best indication of how groups of people are faring.\" 1 Survey Question: In general, how satisfied are Year PercentVery Satisfied Satisfied Diss atisf ied Very Dissatisfied Figure 2 a. 2005- 2009 Arizona BRFSS respondents' self -reported life satisfaction.

As household income increased, so does satisfaction with life; 98.9% of adults making more than $75,000 reported satisfaction within their life. In terms of ethnicity, the vast majority of respondents reported high levels of satisfaction with their lives.

Notably, insufficient sleep has been linked to the development and management of a number of chronic diseases and conditions, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and depression. 1 Diabetes Research has found that insufficient sleep is linked to an increased risk for the development of Type 2 diabetes. Specifically, sleep duration and quality have emerged as predictors of levels of Hemoglobin A1c , an important marker of blood sugar control. Recent research suggests that optimizing sleep duration and quality may be important means of improving blood sugar control in persons with Type 2 diabetes. 2 Cardiovascular Disease Persons with sleep apnea have been found to be at increased risk for a number of cardiovascular diseases. Notably, hypertension, stroke, coronary heart disease and irregular heartbeats (cardiac arrhythmias ) have been found to be more common among those with disordered sleep than their peers without sleep abnormalities. Likewise, sleep apnea and hardening of the arteries ( atherosclerosis ) appear to share some common physiological characteristics, further suggesting that sleep apnea may be an important predictor of cardiovascular disease. 3 Obesity Laboratory research has found that short sleep duration results in metabolic changes that may be linked to obesity. Epidemiologic studies conducted in the community have revealed an association between short sleep duration and excess body weight. Notably, this association has been reported in all age groups \u2014but has been particularly pronounced in children. It is believed that sleep in childhood and adolescence is particularly important for brain development and that insufficient sleep in youngsters may adversely affect the function of a region of the brain known as the hypothalamus , which regulates appetite and the expenditure of energy. 4 Reference s 1 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Center for Disease Control and Prevention Sleep and Sleep Disorder http://www.cdc.gov/sleep/chronic_disease.htm Internet accessed 3 June 2010. 2 Knutson KL, Ryden AM, Mander VA, Van Cauter E.

SLEEP 19Depressio n The relationship between sleep and depression is complex. While sleep disturbance has long been held to be an important symptom of depression, 4 recent research has indicated that depressive symptoms may decrease once sleep apnea has been effectively tre ated and sufficient sleep restored. 5 Survey Question: How many days did you get enough sleep in past 30 days? The interrelatedness of sleep and depression suggests it is important that the sleep sufficiency of persons with depression be assessed and that symptoms of depression are monitored among persons with a sleep disorder.

Asthma can be difficult to diagnose and to distinguish from other respiratory illnesses. 1 Asthma is a serious and growing health problem. According to estimates, 14.9 million persons in the United States have asthma. Asthma is responsible for around 500,000 hospitalizations, 5,000 deaths, and 134 million restricted activity days annually. Yet, people with asthma can avoid most of the problems caused by asthma if they and their health care providers managed the disease according to accepted guidelines.2 The number of asthma -related inpatient hospitalizations in Arizona de clined by more than half from 21,300 in 2000 to 8,287 in 2009. During 2009 , there were 25,893 emergency room visits related to asthma. In addition, children less than 15 years of a ge accounted for 2,998 inpatient discharges and 11,711 emergency room visits . 2 Asthma is a complicated disease that requires a long- term and multifaceted answer. This includes educating, treating, and providing continuing medical care and monitoring for people with asthma, changing behaviors that lead to asthma or exacerbates it , and eliminating or avoiding triggers. 3 Survey Question: Have you EVER been told by a doctor, nurse, or other health professional that you had asthma? 0.05.010.015.020.0Percent Arizona 13.9 12.5 12.4 12.2 14.7 14 14.8 15.5 National 11.8 11.7 13.3 12.6 13 13.1 13.6 13.42002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Figure 6a.

Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States, exceeded only by heart disease. One of every four deaths in the United States is due to cancer. 1 Cancer prevalence is defined as the total number of people living with cancer at any point in time. It includes people diagnosed with cancer in the past as well as people recently diagnosed. Cancer prevalence is not a measure of how common a cancer is. This number is reflected by cancer incidence , which is the number of people newly diagnosed with cancer in a given time period (usually a year). Prevalence is affected both by the incidence of a cancer and by how long people normally live with the disease. 2 Survey Question: Have you EVER been told by a doctor, nurse, or other health professional that you had cancer?

Everyone is at risk of developing some form of cancer. Cancer incidence varies by race and ethnicity, with some groups being more susceptible to certain types of cancers than others. If the current trends continue, one- third of Americans can be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetimes (NCI, 2003a). 1 Surve y Question: What type of cancer was it? Figure 13a .

Each year 15 % of all diagnose s of cancer are lung cancer cases. The prevalence is small because the survival is very short. 62 The National Institutes of Health (NIH) and FDA mandate the inclusion of women and minorities in clinical trials . However, researchers have documented barriers to participating in cancer clinical trials. Barriers include lack of awareness , lack of being invited or recruited to participate, eligibility criteria that may exclude certain groups , fear or mistrust of the medical and scientific community, and cultural barriers (e.g. , language, beliefs, attitudes). In health care systems, physicians may not refer older patients to clinical trials because of concern about toxicity or side effects from the treatment and may exclude patients because of their own prejudices. At a policy level, barriers may include the lack of state mandates for insurance coverage for clinical trials and the lack of appropriate enforcement and ov ersight of existing mandates . 1 Because barriers to and disparities in cancer clinical trial participation exist on multiple levels, addressing these issues requires a comprehensive approach. One such approach is reflected in the comprehensive cancer control (CCC) plan for each state, tribe, territory, or other jurisdiction. 2 Survey Question: Did you participate in a clinical trial as part of your cancer treatment?

Elderly persons with chronic diseases are at high risk for influenza morbidity and mortality.1 \"Influenza A and B are the two types of influenza viruses that cause epidemic human disease.\"2 Since treatment of influenza can only minimize its symptoms, epidemics are most preventable through vaccination against current strains of disease. Objective 14.29a in Healthy People 2010 targets influenza vaccinations at a minimum of 90 perce nt in persons 65 years of age or older. Since new strains of influenza periodically emerge, annual vaccinations are necessary to provide constant protection against infection. Vaccination against influenza is recommended as a part of routine health care for persons age 65 and older and younger persons at risk of medical complications if they should contact influenza. Health care professionals should continue to inform their high risk populations, toward the end of each year, to be vaccinated against current influenza strains.

In the long term, physical inactivity threatens to reverse the decades -long progress that has been made in reducing the morbidity and mortality related with many chronic conditions, e.g., cardiovascular disease. A physically inactive population is at medical and financial risk for many chronic diseases and conditions including heart disease, stroke, colon cancer, diabetes, obesity, and osteoporosis.1 Regular physical activity decreases the risk for heart attack, colon cancer, diabetes, and high blood pressure, and may decrease their risk for stroke. It also helps with weight control; contributes to healthy bones, muscles, and joints; reduces falls among the elderly; helps to relieve the pain of arthritis; decreases symptoms of anxiety and depression; and can decrease the need for hospitalizations, physician visits, and medications. Moreover, physical activity does not need to be strenuous to be beneficial . 2 Regular exercise also can contribute to the functional independence of the elderly and improves the quality of life for people of all ages.3 Survey Questions: Now, thinking about the moderate activities you do in a usual week, do you do moderate activities for at least 10 minutes at a time, such as brisk walking, bicycling, vacuuming, gardening, or anything else that causes some increase in breathing or heart rate? Now, thinking about the vigorous activities you do in a usual week, do you do vigorous activities for at least 10 minutes at a time, such as running, aerobics, heavy yard work, or anything else that causes large increases in breathing or heart rate? How many days per week do you do these (moderat e/vigorous) activities for at least 10 minutes at a time?

STRWT accounts for differences in the bas ic probability of selection among strata (subsets of area code/prefix combinations). It is the inverse of the sampling fraction of each stratum. There is almost never a complete correspondence between strata, which are defined by subsets of ar ea code/prefix combinations, and regions, which are defined by the boundaries of government entities. 1/NPH is the inverse of the number of residential telephone numbers in the respondent's household. NAD is the number of adults in the respondent's household. POSTSTRAT is the number of people in an age-by-gender or age-by-race-by-gender category in the population of a region or a st ate divided by the sum of the products of the preceding weights for the respondents in that same age-by-gender or age-by-race-by-gender category. It adjusts for non-coverage and non-response and, before 1995, also adjusts for different probabilities of selection by region, where applicable.
