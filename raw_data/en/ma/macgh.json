Our historic Craftsman house in the North Capitol Hill neighborhood was built in 1904 and served as both our home and The Vital Energy Center-Integrative healthcare office. The VEC was a sanctuary, set apart from the bustling and rapidly growing city just outside our doors. People came from across the PNW for patient-focused, compassionate and clinically effective healthcare. Our one-of-a-kind health center has been home to so many meaningful events, life-changing adjustments, miraculous healing, weddings, birthdays, art openings, and holiday dinners galore. In June 2020, after 2 decades practicing in Seattle, we made the bittersweet decision to leave and move to Orcas Island full-time to pursue a more nature-centric lifestyle..

Patient Success Stories Kind, Caring Chiropractor You can tell The Vital Energy Center is a special place right away. The care is excellent and Dr. Kohler is very attentive. Your initial consult is thorough, and you walk away with a very clear treatment plan. Gentle and Effective Dr. Kohler is what I refer to as a no-pain chiropractor. I was super hesitant to go see a chiropractor. But when my Pilates instructor suggested her chiro, I figured I should give it a go. By two days after my first adjustment, the pain had left my back. Great local Chiropractor We are lucky to have a gentle, caring chiropractor like Dr. Kohler's in our neighborhood. And fortunate that we can walk there, receive top-notch chiropractic care, walk home, and relax. Join me in supporting a quality local business. "}
