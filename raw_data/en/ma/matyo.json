The Association is staffed by the kindergarten teachers, members of the board of directors (volunteer parents) and the administrative director in joint management. Anthroposophical Education was founded in 1919 by Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925), educator, thinker, and researcher. Anthroposophical Education is also called \"Waldorf Education\" after the first school founded by Steiner. In addition to education, anthroposophy also addresses the fields of medicine, nutrition, agriculture, society, philosophy, science, art, etc. Anthroposophical education is based on Steiner's developmental psychology, which treats the child as a developing entity. According to this approach, childhood is a significant period in which the personality and abilities of the child grow gradually. In accordance with this gradual development Anthroposophical Education provides the appropriate content for each stage of childhood development. The Anthroposophical kindergartens are built and designed as pleasant and aesthetic environments, creating warm and quiet surroundings. A place that accepts and invites and which places a sense of pleasantness and security around the child. These surroundings are not only external and physical, but also mental. We choose what content to bring to the kindergarten, while elements of everyday reality will enter the kindergarten and the child's world. Each kindergarten is run as a kind of home, where the children and staff are partners in its management. Together, we prepare the meals, clean, and nourish the home and its surroundings, out of the belief that action makes security in every person and certainly in the child. In addition, by taking care of the kindergarten's environment this will serve as a personal example for the child - from the movement of the spirit, body gestures and verbal language, to the activities and the organization of the activities. The Adam Association has four kindergartens. The status of the kindergartens in the Ministry of Education is unique. This means that the kindergartens are entitled to partial budgeting and use of public buildings, they operate under a license and are supervised by the Ministry of Education. Each kindergarten has two kindergarten teachers and one additional assistant, each of whom is accompanied by a pedagogical consultant. The mutual cooperation between the parents and the kindergarten staff is very important for the child's development and growth, as well as mutual trust and reflection between the parties are essential for a productive and happy kindergarten life and for finding common solutions to help the child. During the year we meet for events and holiday celebrations in the kindergarten, as well as for events of all the kindergarten community, including on occasions collaboration with the school and wider Anthroposophical community.
