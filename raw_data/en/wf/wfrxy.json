The Silver Stat e Scripts Board (formerly known as the Pharmacy & Therapeutics or P&T Committee) was established to identify prescription drugs to be included on the PDL. A governing body of a county, school district, municipal corporation, political subdivision, public corporation or other local government agency of the State of Nevada that provides coverage of prescription drugs pursuant to NRS 287.010 or any issuer of a policy health insurance purchased pursuant to NRS 287.010 may use the PDL developed by DHHS as its P DL. The PDL is not a restricted formulary. Drugs not on the PDL are still available to recipients if they meet the Standard Preferred Drug List Exception criteria. The Silver State Scripts Board consists of members who are Director-appointed physicians and pharmacists. Members must be licensed to practice in the State of Nevada as either an actively practicing physician or an actively practicing pharmacist. Meetings are held quarterly and are open to the public. Anyone wishing to address the Silver State Scripts Board may do so. Public comment is limited to 5 minutes per speaker/organization (due to time constraints). Anyone presenting documents for consideration must provide sufficient copies for each Board member and an electronic copy to the DHCFP Coordinator for official record. For pharmacists and physicians wishing to serve on the Silver State Scripts Board, please email your contact information, NPI and current CV/Resume to rxinfo@dhcfp.nv.gov Current Board Members: Mark Decerbo, PharmD (Chair man) Kate Ward, PharmD Adashek, MD Evelyn MD Aditi Singh, MD 9Silver State Scripts Board Meeting scheduled for 20 21 Date Time South Nevada Location North Nevada Location March 25, 2021 1:00 PM TBD None June 24, 2021 1:00 PM TBD None September 23, 2021 1:00 PM TBD None December 9, 2021 1:00 PM TBD None Web References Preferred Drug List: https://www.medicaid.nv.gov/providers/rx/PDL.aspx Medicaid Services Manual (MSM) Chapter 1200: http://dhcfp.nv.gov/Resources/AdminSupport/Manuals/MSM/C1200/Chapter1200/ Silver State Scripts Board Bylaws: http://dhcfp.nv.gov/uploadedFiles/dhcfpnvgov/content/Boards/CPT/PandT_Bylaws.pdf The Division of Health Care Financing and Policy Notices: http://dhcfp.nv.gov/Public/AdminSupport/PublicNotices/ 10Definition of \"Therapeutic Alternative\" by the AMA as: \"Drug products with different chemical structures but which are of the same pharmacological and/or therapeutic class and usually can be expected to have similar therapeutic effects and adverse reaction profiles when administered to patients in therapeutically equivalent doses.\" Standard Preferred Drug List Exception Criteria Drugs that have a \"non- preferred\" status are a covered benefit for recipients if they meet the coverage criteria. a.

Status Update by DHCFP Holly Long updated the Board regarding the SUPPORT Act, effective October 1 , 2020, which requires State Medicaid Agencies to cover all FDA - approved prescription drugs used for medication assisted treatment through September 2025. As a result, not all drugs will be considered covered outpatient drugs and will no longer be included in the Feder al Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. The DHCFP is preparing for the changes and announcements will be posted by October 1 , 2020. However, t he DHCFP is monitoring Bill HR 8337 that would allow continuation of these drugs as covered outpatient drugs and subject to rebates. Ms. Long continued with an update on the economic strain on the State budget due to COVID -19 resulting in a $1.2 billion shortfall. Governor Sisolak signed Assembly Bill 83 which implemented and requ ired budgetary changes including reductions in rates and the fee schedule for providers by six percent, reduced the reimbursement rate for neonatal intensive care units , eliminated the increase in acute care per diem for hospital reimbursement rates that p assed in the 2019 legislative session, revised the rate methodology for habilitation providers, delayed non- capitated payments to managed care organizations until fiscal year 2 1-22, implemented a specialty pharmacy network . Assembly Bill Three of the 2020 Special Session provided Nevada Medicaid with flexibility to accept additional money not appropriated from the state general fund allowing flexibility critical for the Medicaid program. Three variabilities contribute to the budget, federal funding, caseload changes and utilization patterns. A public hearing was held August 13 regarding the rate reductions.

Therapeutic Class Overview Multiple Sclerosis Agents INTRODUCTION Multiple Sclerosis (MS), a chronic, immune -mediated disease of the central nervous system (CNS), is among the most common causes of neurological disability in young adults (MS Coalition 2019; National Institutes of Health MS 2019) . Multiple sclerosis is characterized by inflammation, demyelination, and degenerative changes. Most patients with MS experience relapses and remissions of neurological symptoms, usually early in the disease process, with clinical events that are generally associated with CNS inflammation. There are 4 clinical subtypes of MS: oRelapsing- remitting MS (RRMS), which is characterized by acute attacks followed by partial or full recovery. This is the most common form of MS, accounting for an estimated 85% of cases. oSecondary progressive MS (SPMS) begins as RRMS; however, the attack rate declines over time. Patients experience a gradual deterioration. Patients with RRMS for more than 10 years may transition to SPMS. oPrimary progressive MS (PPMS) occurs in approximately 15 % of patients with MS. Patients have a continuous and gradual decline in function without evidence of acute attacks. oClinically isolated syndrome (CIS) refers to the first episode of neurologic symptoms that lasts at least 24 hours and is caused by inflammation or demyelination in the C NS. Patients who experience a CIS may or may not develop MS (Sanvito et al 2011, National MS Society 2020[a] ). A more recent revision of the MS clinical course descriptions recommended that the core MS phenotype descriptions of relapsing and progressive disease be retained with some of the following modifications: (1) an important modifier ofthese core phenotypes is an assessment of disease activity, as defined by clinical assessment of relapse occurrence or lesion activity detected by CNS imaging; (2) the second important modifier of these phenotypes is a determination of whether progression of disability has occurred over a given time period; and (3) the historical category of progressive- relapsing multiples sclerosis ( PRMS ) can be eliminated since subjects so categorized would now be classified as PP MS patients with disease activity (Lublin et al 2014). An estimated 1 million adults in the United States are affected by MS. Most patients are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50 years, and MS is at least 2 to 3 times more common in women than in men (National MS Society 2020[b ]). Diagnosis of MS requires evidence that demonstrates lesions in the CNS showing \"dissemination in space\" (ie, suggestions of damage in > 1 place in the nervous system) and \"dissemination in time\" (ie, suggestions that damage has occurred more than once). It is a diagnosis of exclusion, after consideration of and elimination of more likely diagnoses (Thompson et al 2018) . The patient evaluation includes an extensive history, neurological examination, laboratory tests to rule out other possible causes, magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) to evaluate for new disease and signs of more chronic damage, and possibly lumbar puncture ( Thompson et al 2018 ). Exacerbations, also known as flares, relapses, or attacks of MS are caused by inflammation in the CNS that lead t o damage to the myelin and slowing or blocking of transmission of nerve impulses. A true MS exacerbation must last at least 24 hours and be separated from a previous exacerbation by at least 30 days. Exacerbations can be mild or severe.Intravenous (IV) corticosteroids may be used to treat severe exacerbations of MS. Corticosteroids decrease acute inflammation in the CNS but do not provide any long -term benefits (Frohman et al 2007) . The approach to treating MS includes the management of symptoms, treatment of acute relapses and utilization of disease- modifying therapies ( DMTs ) to reduce the frequency and severity of relapses, reduce lesions on MRI scans, and possibly delay disease and disability progression (Rae-Grant et al 2018 ). The American Academy of Neurology (AAN), the European Committee for Research and Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) and the European Academy of Neurology (EAN) guidelines recommend initiation of DMT s early on in the patient's disease course ( Rae Grant et al 2018[b] , Montalban et al 2018). These therapie s may delay the progression from CIS to clinically definite MS (CDMS) (Miller et al 2012, Armoiry et al 2018) .The MS Coalition, the AAN, and the Association of British Neurologists guidelines support access to available DMTs for patients with MS. While there are no precise algorithms to determine the order of product selection, therapy should be individualized and patients ' clinical response and tolerability to medications should be monitored (MS Coalition 201 9, Rae- Grant et al 2018, Scolding et al 2015). 107 Data as of May 22, 2020 JE-U/JA-U/KMR Page 2 of 37 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. Pediatric -onset MS is rare, with the vast majority of cases demonstrating a relapsing- remitting disease course ( Otallah et al 2018 ). Gilenya (fingolimod) is the first FDA -approved agent for pediatric patients. Its approval was based on the PARADIGMS trial ( Chitnis et al 2018). Cladribine injection is indicated for the treatment of active hairy -cell leukemia ( Clinical Pharmacology 2020). This oncology indication is not related to the treatment of MS and will not be discussed in this review. A recently approved agent in this review, Vumerity (diroximel fumarate), is rapidly converted to monomethyl fumarate Diroximel fumarate dimethyl fumarate ( Naismith et al 2019, Selmaj et al 2019). In April 2020, the FDA approved anot her agent in this class, Bafiertam (monomethyl fumarate). and monomethyl fumarate is its active ingredient. Since the drug is already in its active form, it is administered at a lower dose than dimethyl fumarate, and it is thought that it may lead to fewer GI adverse effects (Drugs@FDA 2020) . All agents in this class review are listed as Multiple Sclerosis Agents in Medispan; the exceptions are mitoxantrone (listed as an antineoplastic antibiotic) and Ampyra (dalfampridine) (listed as a potassium channel blocker) . Table 1. Medications Included Within Class Review\u00a7 Drug Generic Availability Ampyra received FDA-approval; however, settlement agreements will delay launch. Glatopa by Sandoz is an FDA -approved generic for Copaxone (glatiramer acetate). Although brand Novantrone has been discontinued, generic mitoxantrone remains available. \u00a7As of April 30, 2018, the manufacturer has voluntarily withdrawn Zinbryta (daclizumab) from the market; cases of encephalitis and meningoencephalitis have been reported in patients treated with Zinbryta.

INDICATIONS In 2019, the FDA requested all manufacturers of drugs indicated for treatment of MS to revise the language of the indications to conform to contemporary nomenclature. As of May 22, 2020, all drugs have received revised FDA - approved indications except mitoxantrone ( Drugs@FDA 2020 ). Table 2 .

Mitoxantrone is indicated for reducing neurologic disability and/or the frequency of clinical relapses in patients with secondary (chronic) progressive, progressive relapsing, or worsening RRMS (ie, patients whose neurologic status is significantly abnormal between relapses). Mitoxantrone is not indicated for the treatment of patients with PPMS. The product has additionally been approved for several cancer indications including pain related to advanced hormone-refractory prostate cancer and initial therapy of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (includes myelogenous, promyelocytic, monocytic, and erythroid of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML). When initiating and continuing treatment with Tysabri in patients with MS, physicians should consider whether the expected benefit of Tysabri is sufficient to offset this risk. Tysabri is also indicated for inducing and maintaining clinical response and remission in adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease (CD) with evidence of inflammation who have had an inadequate response to, or are unable to tolerate, conventional CD therapies and inhibitors of TNF- . In CD, Tysabri should not be used in combination with immunosuppressants or inhibitors of Vumerity 2020, Zeposia ) Information on indications, mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, dosing, and safety has been obtained from the prescribing information for the individual products, except where noted otherwise. CLINICAL EFFICACY SUMMARY In the management of MS, numerous clinical trials have established the safety and efficacy of the biological response modifiers in reducing the frequency of relapses, lesions on MRI scans, and possibly delaying disease progression and disability. Interferons and glatiramer acetate Pivotal clinical trials demonstrating efficacy in reducing the rate of relapses, burden of disease on MRI, and disability progression for the interferons (IFNs) and glatiramer acetate were published in the 1990's (Jacobs et al 1996 , Johnson et al 1995, The interferon beta [ IFN] Multiple Sclerosis Study Group 1993, The IFN Multiple Sclerosis Study Group 1995) . Long -term follow -up data for IFN -1b show that overall survival in MS is improved (Goodin et al 2012). Head -to-head trials have found to be comparable in terms of relapse rate reduction and disease and disability p rogression (PRISMS 1998, Kappos et al 2006, Mikol et al 2008, Flechter et al 2002, Cadavid et al 2009, O'Connor et al 2009) . Results from several studies suggest that lower dose Avonex (IFN -1a 30 mcg IM once weekly) may be less efficacious while being mor e tolerable compared to Rebif (IFN -1a SC 3 times weekly every other day) or glatiramer acetate (Barbero et al 2006, Durelli et al 2002, Khan et al 2001[a] , Khan et al 2001[b] , Panitch et al 2002, Panitch et al 2005, Schwid et al 2005, Schwid et al 2007, Traboulsee et al 2008) . In a meta- analysis of 5 randomized studies comparing IFNs with glatiramer acetate, there were no significant differences between IFNs and glatiramer acetate in terms of the number of patients with relapses, confirmed progression, or discontinuation due to adverse events at 24 months (La Mantia et al 2016) . o At 36 months, however, evidence from a single study suggested that relapse rates were higher in the group given IFNs tha n in the glatiramer acetate group (risk ratio [ RR] 1.40, 95% confidence interval [ CI]: 1.13 to 1.74; p = 0.002). While a MRI outcomes analysis showed that effects on newer enlarging T2 or new contrast -enhancing T1 lesions at 24 months were similar, the reduction in T2- and T1- weighted lesion volume was significantly greater in the groups given IFNs than in the glatiramer acetate groups ( mean difference [ MD] 0.58, 95% CI: 0.99 to and MD 0.20, 95% CI: 0.33 to 0.07 ; p = 0.003, respectively). In a network meta- analysis of 24 studies comparing IFNs and glatiramer acetate, both drugs were found to reduce the annualized relapse rate (ARR) as compared to placebo but did not differ statistically from ea ch other ( Melendez -Torres et al 2018). Ranking of the drugs based on SUCRA (surface under the cumulative ranking curve) indicated that glatiramer acetate 20 mg once daily had the highest probability for superiority, followed by peginterferon -1a 125 mcg every 2 weeks. A meta -analysis of 6 placebo -controlled trials failed to find a significant advantage of Avonex (IFN -1a) 30 mcg IM once weekly compared to placebo in the number of relapse -free patients after 1 year of therapy (Freedman et al 2008). In contrast, other studies found Avonex (IFN -1a) 30 mcg IM once weekly to be comparable to the other IFN products in terms of relapse rate reduction, disability progression, and SPMS development (Carra et al 2008, Limmroth et al 2007, Minagara et al 2008, Rio et al 2005, Trojano et al 2003, Trojano et al 2007). Moreover, IFN therapy, especially the higher dose products, is associated with the production of neutralizing antibodies (NAb), which may result in decreased 110 Data as of May 22, 2020 JE-U/JA-U/KMR Page 5 of 37 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Exploratory post -hoc analyses of the PRISMS trial linked the development of NAb with reduced efficacy (Alsop et al 2005) . Development of NAb among patients ( N = 368) randomized to receive Rebif (IFN-1a) 44 or 22 mcg SC 3 times weekly for 4 years was associated with higher relapse rates (adjusted relapse rate ratio, 1.41; 95% CI : 1.12 to 1.78; p = 0.004), a greater number of active lesions, and percentage change in T2 lesion burden from baseline on MRI scan ( p < 0.001). In a systematic review of 40 studies of MS agents including IFN -1a and IFN -1b, the primary outcome measure was the frequency of IFN NAb (Govindappa et al 2015) . NAb development was most frequent with IFN -1b, followed by IFN -1a SC, and lowest with IFN -1a IM. Higher doses were associated with a higher rate of NAb development. The CombiRx trial evaluated the combination of Copaxone (glatiramer acetate) and Avonex (IFN -1a IM) over 3 years. The ARR for the combination therapy (IFN -1a + glatiramer) was not statistically superior to the better of the 2 single treatment arms (glatiramer) ( p = 0.27). The ARR s were 0.12 for the combination therapy, 0.16 for IFN -1a, and 0.11 for glatiramer acetate. Glatiramer acetate performed significantly better than IFN -1a, reducing the risk of exacerbation by = 0.027), and IFN glatiramer acetate performed significantly better than IFN reducing the risk of exac erbation by 25% ( p = 0.022). The 3 treatment groups did not show a significant difference in disability progression over 6 months. Combination therapy was superior to either monotherapy in reducing new lesion activity and accumulation of total lesion volum e (Lublin et al 2013). It is estimated that within a few years of initiating treatment, at least 30 and 15% of patients discontinue MS biological response modifiers due to perceived lack of efficacy or side effects, respectively (Coyle 2008, Portaccio et al 2008) . According to several observational studies, switching patients who have failed to adequately respond to initial treatment to another recommended therapy is safe and effective (Caon et al 2006, Carra et al 2008, Zwibel 2006, ). Patients switching to glatiramer acetate after experiencing an inadequate response to IFN -1a therapy had a reduction in relapse rates and disability progression. Likewise, switching to IFN -1a therapy after suboptimal efficacy with glatiramer acetate increased the number of relapse- free patients in 1 study (Carra et al 2008) . The smallest reduction in the ARR was seen in patients who had switched from one IFN -1a preparation to another. The GALA study evaluated glatiramer acetate SC 40 mg 3 times weekly compared to placebo in 1404 patients with relapsing MS over 12 months. Results demonstrated that glatiramer acetate 40 mg 3 times weekly, compared to placebo, reduced the ARR and MRI endpoints (Kha n et al 2013) . A Phase 3 dose comparison study evaluated glatiramer acetate 20 mg and 40 mg each given daily in 1155 patients with MS. The primary endpoint, mean ARR, was similar in both groups : ARR = 0.33 (20 mg group) vs ARR = 0.35 ( 40 mg group). For patients from both groups who completed the entire 1- year treatment period, the mean ARR = 0.27 (Comi et al 2011) . The efficacy and safety of Plegridy (peginterferon -1a) in adult patients with MS (n = 1516) were e valuated in ADVANCE, a Phase 3, multicenter , randomized, placebo- controlled trial. Eligible adult patients had RRMS with a baseline Expanded Disability Status Scale ( EDSS) score 5 and 2 clinically documented relapses in the previous 3 years with at least 1 relapse in the previous 12 months. Patients were randomized to placebo or SC peginterferon -1a 125 mcg every 2 weeks or every 4 weeks for 48 weeks. Approximately 81% of patients were treatment na\u00efve. o At week 48, ARR s were significantly lower in the peginterferon -1a every 2 week group (ARR = 0.256; p = 0.0007) and peginterferon -1a every 4 week group (ARR = 0.288; p = 0.0114) compared to placebo (ARR = 0.397). o There were also significant differences between the peginterferon -1a every 2 weeks and every 4 weeks groups compared to placebo in the proportion of patients with relapse at week 48 ( p = 0.0003 and p = 0.02, respectively). The proportions of patients with 12 weeks of sustained disability progression at the end of the 48 week study period were significantly lower in the pegi nterferon -1a groups (both 6.8%; p = 0.0383 for every 2 weeks group; p = 0.038 for every 4 weeks group) compared to placebo (10.5%). o The mean number of new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions on MRI were significantly reduced in the peginterferon -1a every 2 weeks group compared to placebo (3.6 lesions vs 10.9 lesions, respectively; p < 0.0001). Significant beneficial effects on the mean number of Gadolinium (Gd)-enhancing lesions were also observed with peginterferon -1a every 2 weeks compared to placebo ( p < 0.0001). o During the 48 weeks of treatment, the most commonly reported adverse effects included influenza- like illness and injection site erythema. Discontinuations due to adverse effects were higher in the peginterferon -1a groups compa red to placebo (Calabresi et al 2014b) . o NAb to interferon -1a were identified in < 1% of all groups after 1 year (peginterferon -1a every 2 weeks, 4 patients; peginterferon -1a every 4 weeks, 2 patients; placebo, 2 patients) (Calabresi et al 2014b) . Pre liminary data on NAb development to peginterferon -1a over 2 years show ed < 1% for all groups (White et al 2014) . 111 Data as of May 22, 2020 JE-U/JA-U/KMR Page 6 of 37 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Patients originally randomized to placebo were re ebo-switch group\"). Peginterferon -1a patients were continued on their original assigned therapy. A total of 1332 patients entered the second year of the study. After 96 weeks, the ARR was significantly lower in the peginterferon -1a every 2 weeks group (ARR 0.221; p = 0.0001 vs placebo- switch group; p = 0.0209 vs every 4 week regimen) compared to both the placebo- switch group (ARR 0.351) and the peginterferon -1a every 4 week group (ARR 0.291). The peginterferon -1a every 4 week group (ARR 0.291; p = NS vs placebo- switch group) was not significantly different from the placebo- switch group (ARR 0.351) after 96 weeks based on the intent -to-treat (ITT) analysis. Peginterferon -1a every 2 weeks was also associated with a lower proportion of patients who had relapse and a lower proportion of patients who had disability progression. Mean number of new or newly enlarging T2 -weighted hyperintense MRI lesions over 2 years w as numerically lower with the peginterferon -1a every 2 weeks group compared to the placebo- switch group (Calabresi et al 2014b, Kieseier et al 2015) . The ATTAIN study was a n open -label extension of the ADVANCE study, where patients were followed for an additional 2 years ( Newsome et al 2018). Of the original ADVANCE patients, 71% continued into the ATTAIN study , and 78% of those patients completed the extension study. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the long- term safety of peginterferon -1a. During the study, the common adverse events were influenza-like illness (43%), injection site erythema (41%), and headache (29%). The rate of treatment -related serious adverse events was 1%. The adjusted ARR and risk of relapse was reduced significantly with the every 2 weeks compared to the every 4 weeks dosing group (0.188 vs (fingolimod) been evaluated in 2 large, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in adults against placebo and against Avonex (IFN -1a IM). In FREEDOMS, a 24 -month placebo- controlled trial, fingolimod (0.5 and 1.25 mg once daily) was associated with significant reductions in ARR compared to placebo (54 and 60%, respectively; p < 0.001 for both). Moreover, fingolimod was associated with reductions in disability progression and a prolonged time to first relapse compared to placebo (Kappos et al 2010) . In the 12- month TRANSFORMS trial, fingolimod 0.5 and 1.25 mg once daily significantly reduced ARR by 52 and 40%, respectively, compared to IFN -1a 30 mcg IM once weekly ( p < 0.001 for both) (Cohen et al 2010). In a 12 -month extension of TRANSFORMS, patients initially randomized to IFN -1a IM were switched to either dose of fingolimod for 12 additional months and experienced significant reductions in ARR compared to initial treatment with IFN -1a IM. Patients switched from IFN -1a IM to fingolimod experienced fewer adverse events compared to treatment with IFN -1a IM in the core study (86 vs 91% and 91 vs 94% for the 0.5 and 1.25 mg groups, respectively; p values not reported). Fewer patients continuing fingolimod from the core study reported adverse events in the extension period compared to the core study (72 vs 86% and 71 vs 90% for the 0.5 and 1.25 mg doses, respectively; p values not reported) (Khatri et al 2011) . The TRANSFORMS extension study followed patients for up to 4.5 years with results consistent with those observed in the first 12 months of the extension study; however, there was significant attrition bias with very few patients enrolled past 36 months (Cohen et al 2015). In the FREEDOMS II study, a 24 -month placebo- contro lled study, fingolimod (0.5 mg and 1.25 mg) significantly reduced ARR compared to placebo (48 and 50%, respectively; both p < 0.0001) (Calabresi et al 2014a) . Mean percentage brain volume change was lower with both fingolimod doses compared to placebo. Fingolimod did not show a significant effect on time to disability progression at 3 months compared to placebo. Fingolimod has also been evaluated in pediatric patients with relapsing MS ( Chitnis et al 2018). The PARADIGMS trial randomized patients between 10 and 17 years of age to fingolimod 0.5 mg daily (0.25 mg for patients 40 kg) or IFN - 1a IM 30 mcg weekly for up to 2 years. Fingolimod significantly reduced ARR compared to IFN -1a IM (adjusted rates, 0.12 vs 0.67; relative difference of 82%; p < 0.001). Fingolimod was also associated with a 53% relative reduction in the annualized rate of new or newly enlarged lesions on MRI . However, serious adverse events occurred more frequently with fingolimod than IFN and safety of Aubagio (teriflunomide) were evaluated in two Phase 3, double -blind, placebo- controlled , RCTs - the TEMSO trial ( O'Connor et al, 2011) and the TOWER trial (Confavreux et al 2014) . In the TEMSO trial, ents with relapsing MS were randomized to teriflunomide 7 mg or 14 mg daily or placebo for a total of 108 weeks. Results demonstrated that compared to placebo, teriflunomide at both doses, reduced the ARR. o The percentage of patients with confirmed disabil ity progression (CDP) was significantly lower only in the teriflunomide 14 mg group (20.2%) compared to placebo (27.3%; p = 0.03) (O'Connor et al 2011) . 112 Data as of May 22, 2020 JE-U/JA-U/KMR Page 7 of 37 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. Teriflunomide has demonstrated beneficial effects on MRI scans in a Phase 2, randomized, double- blind, clinical trial. A total of 179 patients with MS were randomized to teriflunomide 7 mg or 14 mg daily or placebo for 36 weeks and were followed every 6 weeks with MRI scans during the treatment period. The teriflunomide groups had significant reductions in the average number of unique active lesions per MRI scan (O'Connor et al 2006) . In the TOWER trial, 1165 patients with relapsing MS were randomized to teriflunomide 7 mg or 14 mg daily or placebo for at least 48 weeks of therapy. The study ended 48 weeks after the last patient was randomized. Results demonstrated that, compared to placebo, teriflunomide 14 mg significantly reduced the ARR and the risk of sustained accumulation of disability (Confavreux et al 2014). Teriflunomide and R ebif (IFN -1a SC) were compared in the 48- week TENERE study evaluating 324 patients with relapsing MS. The primary outcome, time to failure defined as a confirmed relapse or permanent discontinuation for any cause, was comparable for teriflunomide 7 mg and 14 mg and R ebif was evaluated in two Phase 3 studies: DEFINE and CONFIRM (Gold et al 2012, Fox et al 2012, Xu et al 2015) . DEFINE was a multicenter RCT that compared 2 dosing regimens of dimethyl fumarate (240 mg twice daily and 240 mg 3 times daily) to placebo in 1237 patients with RRMS over 96 weeks . Results demonstrated that, compared to placebo, treatment with both doses of dimethyl fumarate reduced the proportion of patients with a relapse within 2 years , the ARR , the number of lesions on MRI, and the proportion of patients with disability progression (Gold et al 2012) . CONFIRM was a multicenter RCT that compared 2 dosing regimens of dimethyl fumarate (240 mg twice daily and 240 mg 3 times daily) to placebo, with an additional, open-label study arm evaluating glatiramer acetate 20 mg SC daily. Glatiramer acetate was included as a reference comparator, but the study was not designed to test the superio rity or non-inferiority of dimethyl fumarate vs glatiramer acetate. There were 1430 patients enrolled, and the trial duration was 96 weeks. Results of CONFIRM were similar to DEFINE, with the exception that there was no significant difference between groups in the likelihood of disability progression. The CONFIRM trial demonstrated that, compared to placebo, treatment with both doses of dimethyl fumarate reduced the proportion of patients with a relapse within 2 years , the ARR , and the number of lesions on MRI (Fox et al 2012) . Bafiertam (monomethyl fumarate) The of dimethyl fumarate, is based on bioavailability studies in healthy patients comparing oral dimethyl fumarate delayed- release capsules to monomet hyl fumarate delayed -release capsules. Analyses compared the blood levels of monomethyl fumarate to establish bioequivalency and support the Prescribing Information 2020). Tysabri (natalizumab) Tysabri (natalizumab) reduced the risk of experiencing at least 1 new exacerbation at 2 years and reduced the risk of experiencing progression at 2 years (Polman et al 2006, Pucci et al 2011, Rudick et al 2006). The AFFIRM trial compared natalizumab to placebo in patients with MS with less than 6 months of treatment experience with any DMT . Natalizumab reduced the ARR at 1 and 2 years compared to placebo. The cumulative probability of sustained disability progression and lesion burden on MRI were significantly reduced with natalizumab compared to placebo (Polman et al 2006) . In the SENTINEL trial, natalizumab was compared to placebo in patients who were receiving IFN -1a IM 30 mcg once weekly for at least 1 year. The combination of natalizumab plus IFN -1a IM resulted in a significant reduction in ARR at year 1 and 2 and significant reduction in cumulative probability of sustained disability progression at year 2. Lesion burden on MRI was also significantly reduced with the combination therapy. Two cases of PML were reported in the SENTINEL patient population resulting in the early termination of the trial (Rudick et al 2006). Lemtrada (alemtuzumab) The efficacy and safety of alemtuzumab were compared to Rebif (IFN -1a SC) in two Phase 3, open- label RCTs in patients with relapsing forms of MS - CARE -MS I and CARE -MS II ( Cohen et al 2012, Coles et al 2012) . In the 2-year studies, patients were randomized to alemtuzumab infused for 5 consecutive days followed by a 3 consecutive day treatment course 12 months later or to R ebif (IFN -1a SC) 44 mcg 3 times weekly after an initial dosage titration. All patients received methylprednisolone 1 g IV for 3 consecutive days at the initiation of treatment and at month 12. o The CARE -MS I trial enrolled treatment -na\u00efve patients with MS ( n = 581) who were high functioning based on the requirement of a score of 3 or lower on the EDSS. 113 Data as of May 22, 2020 JE-U/JA-U/KMR Page 8 of 37 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Patients were required to have an EDSS score of 5. o The co -primary endpoints for both trials were the relapse rate and the time to 6-month sustained accumulation of disability. o In the CARE-M S I trial, alemtuzumab reduced the risk of relapse by 55% com IFN -1a 40% of IFN -1a SC patients over 2 years. The proportion of patients having sustained accumulation of disability over 6 months was not significantly different between alemtuzumab (8%) vs IFN -1a SC (11%) (p = o In the CARE- MS II trial, alemtuzumab significantly reduced the relapse rate and sustained accumulation of disability compared to IFN -1a SC. The relapse rate at 2 years was reduced by 49% with alemtuzumab (p < 0.0001). The percent of patients with sustained accumulation of disability confirmed over 6 months was 13% with alemtuzumab and 20% with IFN reduction with alemtuzumab ( p = 0.0084). o Both studies evaluated MRI outcomes, specifically the median percent change in T2 hyperintense lesion volume from baseline. Neither study found a significant difference between the 2 drugs for this measure. o During extension studies of CARE -MS I and CARE -MS II , approximately 80% of patients previously treated with alemtuzumab did not require additional treatment during the first year of the extension study (Garnock -Jones 2014) . A Cochrane review by Zhang et al (2017) that compared the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of alemtuzumab vs IFN -1a in the treatment of RRMS identified 3 RCTs in 1694 total patients from the CARE -MS I, CARE -MS II , and CAMMS223 studies . In the alemtuzumab 12 mg/day group, the results showed statistically significant differences in reducing relapses (RR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.52 to 0.70); preventing disease progression (RR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.45 to 0.79) ; and developing new T2 -weighted lesions on MRI (RR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.61 to 0.93) after 24 and 36 months' follow- up, but found no statistically significant difference in the changes of EDSS score (MD = -0.35, 95% CI: -0.73 to 0.03). In the alemtuzumab 24 mg/ day group, the results showed statistically significant differences in reducing relapses (RR = 0.38, 95% CI : 0.23 to 0.62) ; preventing disease progression (RR = 0.42, 95% CI : 0.21 to 0.84) ; and the changes of EDSS score (MD = -0.83, 95% CI : -1.17 to -0.49) after 36 months' follow- up. The most frequently reported adverse effects with alemtuzumab were infusion- associated reactions, infections, and autoimmune events. Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) The Phase 3 clinical development program for ocrelizumab (ORCHESTRA) included 3 studies: OPERA I, OPERA II, and ORATORIO (Hauser et al 2017, Montalban et al 2017) . o OPERA I and OPERA II were 2 identically -designed, 96-w eek, Phase that evaluated the efficacy and safety of ocrelizumab (600 mg administered as an IV infusion given as 2- 300 mg infusions separated by 2 weeks for dose 1 and then as a single 600 mg infusion every 6 months for subsequent doses) compared with Rebif (IFN -1a 44 mcg SC 3 times week ly) in 1656 patients with relapsing MS (Hauser et al 2017, Web site, Ocrevus Formulary Submission Dossier 2017) . Across both studies, the majority of patients had not been treated with a DMT in the 2 years before screening (range: 71.4% to 75.3%); of those patients that had received a previous DMT as allowed by the protocol, most received IFN (18.0% to 21.0%) or glatiramer acetate (9.0% to 10.6%). Two patients previously treated with natalizumab for < 1 year were included, while 5 patients previously treated with fingolimod and 1 patient previously treated with dimethyl fumarate (both not within 6 months of screening) were also included. Ocrelizumab achieved statistically significant reductions in the ARR vs Rebif (IFN-1a SC) across both trials (primary endpoint). OPERA I (0.16 vs 0.29; 46% lower rate with ocrelizumab; p < 0.001) OPERA II (0.1 6 vs 0.29; 47% lower rate; p < 0.001) In pre- specified pooled analyses (secondary endpoints), the percentage of patients with disability progression confirmed at 12 weeks was statistically significantly lower with ocrelizumab vs Rebif (9. 1% vs 13.6%; hazard ratio [HR] 0.60, 95% CI: 0.45 to 0.81; p < 0.001). The results were similar for disability progression confirmed at 24 weeks: 6.9% vs 10.5%; HR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.43 to 0.84; p = 0.003. The percentages of patients with disability improvement confirmed at 12 weeks were 20.7% in the ocrelizumab group vs 15.6% in the Rebif group (33% higher rate of improvement with ocrelizumab; p = 0.02). The mean numbers of Gd -enhancing lesions per T1- weighted MRI scan were statistically significantly reduced with ocrelizumab vs Rebif (secondary endpoint). 114 Data as of May 22, 2020 JE-U/JA-U/KMR Page 9 of 37 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

OPERA I: 0. 02 vs 0.29 (rate ratio = 0.06, 95% CI: 0.03 to 0.10; p < 0.001) OPER A II: 0.02 vs 0.42 ratio CI: 0.03 to 0.09; 95% lower number of lesions; p < 0.001) The most common adverse events were infusion -related reactions and infections. o No opportunistic infections, including PML, were reported in any group over the duration of either trial. An imbalance of malignancies was observed with ocrelizumab; across both studies and through 96 weeks, neopl asms occurred in 0.5% (4/825) patients. Among the ocrelizumab -treated patients that developed neoplasms, there were 2 cases of invasive ductal breast carcinoma, 1 case of renal -cell carcinom a, and 1 case of malignant melanoma. Rebif -treated patients with neoplasms included 1 case of mantle- cell lymphoma and 1 case of squamous -cell carcinoma in the chest. Between the clinical cutoff dates of the 2 trials (April 2, 2015 [OPERA I] and May 12, 2015 [OPERA II]) and June 30, 2016, 5 additional cases of neoplasm (2 cases of breast cancer, 2 cases of basal -cell skin carcinoma, and 1 case of malignant melanoma) were observed during the OL extension phase in which all continuing patients received ocreli zumab. o ORATORIO was an event -driven, Phase 3, double -blind, multicenter , placebo -controlled, RCT evaluating the efficacy and safety of ocrelizumab (600 mg administered by IV infusion every 6 months; given as 2- 300 mg infusions 2 weeks apart for each dose) compared with placebo in 732 people with PPMS (Montalban et al 2017, ClinicalTrials.gov Web site, Ocrevus Formulary Submission Dossier 2017). Double -blind treatment was administered for a minimum of 5 doses (120 weeks) until the occurrence of ~253 events of disability progression in the trial cohort that was confirmed for at least 12 weeks. The majority of patients (~88%) reported no previous use of DMTs within 2 years of trial entry. The proportion of patients with Gd- enhancing lesions was similar (27.5% in the ocrelizumab group vs 24.7% in the placebo group); however, there was an imbalance in the mean number of Gd- enhancing lesions at baseline, with nearly 50% fewer lesions in the placebo group (1.21 vs 0.6) ( Ocrevus FDA Medical and Summary Reviews 2017). For the primary endpoint, the percentages of patients with 12- week confirmed disability progres sion were 32.9% with ocreliz = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.59 to 0.98; relative risk reduction of 24%; p = 0.03). The percentages of patients with 24 -week CDP , a secondary endpoint to 0.98; relative risk reduction of 25%; p = 0.04). Additional secondary endpoints included changes in the timed 25 -foot walk, the total volume of hyperintense brain lesions on T2 -weighted MRI, and brain volume loss. The proportion of patients with 20% worsening of the timed 25-foot walk confirmed at 12 weeks was 49% in ocrelizumab -treated patients compared to 59% in placebo-treated patients (25% risk reduction). From baseline to Week 120, the total volume of hyperintense brain lesions o n T2-weighted MRI decreased by 3.37% in ocrelizumab- treated patients and increased by 7.43% in placebo-treated patients ( p < 0.001). From Weeks 24 to 120, the percentage of brain volume loss was 0.90% with ocreli zumab vs 1.09% with placebo (p = 0.02). Infusion -related reactions, upper respiratory tract infections, and oral herpes infections occurred more frequently with ocrelizumab vs placebo. Neoplasms occurred in 2.3% (11/486) of patients treated with ocrelizumab vs 0.8% (2/239) of patients who received placebo. Among the ocrelizumab-treated patients that developed neoplasms, there were 4 cases of breast cancer, 3 cases of basal -cell carcinoma, and 1 case in each of the following: endometrial adenocarcinoma, anaplastic large- fibrous histiocytoma, and pancreatic carcinoma. In the placebo group, 1 patient developed cervical adenocarcinoma in situ and 1 patient developed basal -cell carcinoma. Between the clinical cutoff date (July 24, 2015) and June 30, 2016, 2 additional cases of neoplasm (1 case of basal -cell skin carcinoma and 1 case of squamous- cell carcinoma) were detected during the open -label extension phase in which all patients received ocrelizumab. Mayzent (siponimod) The P hase 3 EXPAND trial was double -blind, parallel -group, placebo- controlled, time -to-event RCT in patients with SPMS who had evidence of disability progression in the previous 2 year s (Kappos et al 2018). o A total of 1651 patients were randomized to treatment with either siponimod 2 mg (n = 1105) or placebo ( n = 546). o A total of 82% of the siponimod -treated patients and 78% of placebo-treated patients completed the study. The median age of patients was 49.0 years, 95% of patients were white, and 60% were female. 115 Data as of May 22, 2020 JE-U/JA-U/KMR Page 10 of 37 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. o For the primary endpoint, 288 (26%) of 1096 patients receiving siponimod and 173 (32%) of 545 patients receiving placebo had a 3- month CDP (HR 0.79; 95% CI: 0.65 to 0.95; RR reduction, 21%; p = 0.013). o Key secondary endpoints included time to 3- month confirmed worsening of at least 20% from baseline in timed 25 - foot walk (T25FW) and change from baseline in T2 lesion volume on MRI. Siponimod did not show a significant difference in T25FW. o Patients treated with siponimod had a 55% relative reduction in ARR (0.071 vs 0.16) , compared to placebo (nominal p < 0.01). The absolute reduction in the ARR was 0.089 with siponimod. Mavenclad (cladribine) The 96-week Phase 3 double- blind, 3-arm, placebo- controlled, multicenter RCT to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral cladribine in 1326 patients with RRMS (Giovannoni et al 2010, Giovannoni 2017 ). o Patients were required to have at least 1 relapse in the previous 12 months. The median patient age was 39 years and the female- to-male ratio was 2:1. The mean duration of MS prior to study reenrollment was 8.7 years. o Patients were randomized to receive either placebo (n = 437), or a cumulative oral dose of cladribine 3.5 mg/kg (n = 433) or 5.25 mg/ kg (n = 456) over the 96- week study period in 2 treatment courses. o The primary outcome was ARR: ARRs at 96 weeks were reduced in both cladribine treatment groups v s placebo (0.14, 0.15, and 0.33 in the 3.5 mg/kg, 5.25 mg/kg and placebo groups , resp ectively; each p < 0.001) . o A significantly higher percentage of patients remained relapse- free at 96 weeks in both cladribine treatment groups vs placebo; a total of 79.7% and 78.9% of patients in the 3.5 mg/kg and 5.25 mg/kg groups , respectively, were relapse free vs 60.9% in the placebo group (each p < 0.001 vs placebo). o Cladribine 3.5 mg/ kg significant ly lower ed the ARR vs the 5.25 mg/kg treatment group. Vumerity (diroximel fumarate) The efficacy of diroximel fumarate was established through bioavailability studies in patients with relapsing forms of MS and healthy subjects comparing oral dimethyl to diroximel fumarate ( In a Phase 3, open- label, long- term safety study, 696 patients with RRMS (EVOLVE- MS-1) were administered diroximel fumarate 462 mg twice daily for up to 96 weeks (Palte et al 2019). Interim results revealed that GI treatment -emergent adverse events occurred in 215 (30.9%) of patients; the vast majority of these events (207 [96%]) were mild or moderate in severity. Gastrointestinal events occurred early in therapy, resolved (88.8%; 191/215), and were of short duration (median 7.5 days) in most patients. Discontinuation of treatment due to a GI treatment -emergent adverse event occurred in < 1% of patients. Topline results from the randomized, double- blind, 5-week, Phase 3, EVOLVE -MS-2 study also demonstrated significantly improved GI tolerability with diroximel fumarate v s dimethyl fumarate in 506 patients with RRMS (Selmaj et al 2019 ). Patients were randomized to diroximel fumarate 462 mg twice daily or dimethyl fumarate 240 mg twice daily. The primary endpoint was the number of days patients reported GI symptoms with a symptom intensity score 2 on the Individual Gastrointestinal Symptom and Impact Scale (IGISIS) rating scale. Results revealed that patients treated with diroximel fumarate self -reported significantly fewer days of key GI symptoms with intensity scores 2 as compared to dimethyl fumarate (p = 0.0003). The most commonly reported adverse events for both groups were flushing, diarrhea, and nausea. Zeposia (ozanimod) The efficacy and safety of ozanimod were compared to Avonex (IFN -1a IM) in two multicenter, Phase 3, double -blind, double- dummy RCTs in patients with relapsing forms of MS - SUNBEAM and RADIANCE ( Comi et al 2019, Cohen et al 2019) . In the studies, which were conducted over a minimum of 12 months, patients were randomized 1:1:1 to oral ozanimod 0.5 mg daily, oral ozanimod 1 mg daily, or Avonex (IFN -1a) 30 mcg IM once weekly . Patients randomized to ozanimod received a placebo IM injection once weekly , and those randomized to IFN received placebo capsules once daily. o All patients received an initial 7 -day dose escalation of ozanimod or placebo prior to receiving their assigned dose on day 8. Prophylactic administration of acetaminophen or ibuprofen was recommended 1 hour before each IFN or placebo injection and every 6 hours for 24 hours after the injection. o Patients in both trials (n = 1346 for SUNBEAM and n = 1320 for RADIANCE) had an EDSS score of 5, and a history of at least 1 relapse within 12 months prior to screening or 1 relapse within 24 months in addition to at least 1 Gd-enhancing lesion within 12 months prior to screening. The primary endpoint in both trials was the ARR. 116 Data as of May 22, 2020 JE-U/JA-U/KMR Page 11 of 37 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. o In the SUNBEAM, the ARR was 0.18 (95% CI : 0.14 to 0.24) for ozanimod 1 mg, 0.24 (95% CI : 0.19 to 0.31) for ozanimod 0.5 mg, and 0.35 (95% CI : 0.28 to 0.44) for IFN -1a. Significant reductions in ARR were observed compared to IFN -1a with both ozanimod 1 mg (rate ratio, 0.52; 95% CI : 0.41 to 0.66; p < 0.0001) and ozanimod 0.5 mg (rate ratio, 0.69; 95% CI : 0.55 to 0.86; p = 0.0013). o In the RADIANCE trial, adjusted ARRs were found to be 0.17 (95% CI : 0.14 to 0.21) for ozanimod 1 mg, 0.22 (95% CI: 0.18 to 0.26) for ozanimod 0.5 mg, and 0.28 (95% CI : 0.23 to 0.32) for IFN -1a. The rate ratios were significant when comparing ozanimod 1 mg (rate ratio, 0.62; 95% CI : 0.51 to 0.77; p < 0.0001) and ozanimod 0.5 mg (rate ratio, 0.79; 95% CI : 0.65 to 0.96; p = 0.0167) to IFN -1a. o Clinically significant evidence of bradycardia, second-, or third -degree heart block was not noted after administration of the first dose in either trial. Symptomatic MS Despite the demonstrated efficacy of DMTs, for many patients there is little evidence of their effect on quality of life (QOL) in general or symptom management in particular. Impaired mobility contributes to direct and indirect costs (Miravelle et al 2011) . o Ampyra (dalfampridine) is the only FDA -approved agent for the symptomatic treatment of impaired mobility in patients with MS. Improvement of walking ability with dalfampridine was demonstrated in two 14- week, double- blind, Phase 3, RCTs of 540 patients of all MS types. Compared to placebo, dalfampridine significantly improved the walking speed by about 25% in approximately one-third of MS patients as measured by the T25FW (Goodman et al 2009, Jensen et al 2014, Ruck et al 2014). o However, questions have been raised regarding the cost -effectiveness of dalfampridine, and whether treatment leads to a long- term clinically meaningful therapeutic benefit. To address the benefit of long- term therapy with dalfampridine , an open- label, observational study of 52 MS patients with impaired mobility was conducted. Results demonstrated that about 60% of patients were still on treatment after 9 to 12 months. Two weeks after treatment initiation, significant ameliorations could be found for T25FW, maximum walking distance, as well as motoric and cognitive fatigue, which persisted after 9 to 12 months (Ruck et al 2014) . Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS) IFNs, Copaxone (glatiramer acetate) and Aubagio (teriflunomide) have evidence supporting a significant delay in the time to development of a second exacerbation, compared to placebo, in patients with an isolated demyelinating event. o In the PRECISE trial, glatiramer acetate significantly reduced the risk of converting to a CDMS diagnosis by 45% compared to placebo in patients with CIS ( p = 0.005). In addition, the time for 25% of patients to convert to CDMS was significantly prolonged with glatiramer acetate compared to placebo (722 vs 336 days; p = 0.0041) (Comi et al 2009) . In the 2 year, open -label extension phase of PRECISE, early initiation of glatiramer acetate demonstrated a 41% reduced risk of CDMS compared to delayed glatiramer acetate (HR : 0.59; 95% 0.44 to 0.8; = 0.0005). Over the 2-year extension, the baseline -adjusted proportions of patients who developed CDMS were 29.4% and 46.5% for the early and late initiation treatment groups ( odds r atio [ OR]: o A meta -analysis of randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled trials in patients with CIS found a significantly lower risk of CD MS with IFN therapy compared to placebo ( p < 0.0001) (Clerico et al 2008) . A 10 -year, multicenter, randomized clinical trial with IFN -1a IM demonstrated that immediate initiation of therapy in patients with CIS reduced the risk for relapses over 10 years, but it was not associated with improved disability outcomes compared to a control group that also initiated therapy relatively early in the disease (Kinkel et al 2012) . Over the 10- year study, the drop -out rate was significant. Similar results were observed with IFN -1b (BENEFIT study) over an 8-year observation period. Patients who received treatment early had a lower overall ARR compared to those patients who delayed treatment (Kappos et al 2007, Edan et al 2014). In the first 3 years of BENEFIT, early treatment with IFN - 1b reduced the risk for progression of disability by 40% compared to delayed treatment (16% vs 25%, respectively; HR = 0.6; 95% CI : 0.39 to 0.92; p = 0.022). o A 2018 systematic review and network meta- analysis of RCTs was conducted to assess the potential short - and long- term ben efits of treatment with IFN - or glatiramer acetate in patients with CIS ( Armoiry et al 2018). The review identified 5 primary RCTs that assessed the time to CDMS in patients with CIS treated with IFN - or glatiramer acetate vs placebo. They found that all drugs reduced the time to CDMS when compared with placebo, with a pooled HR of 0.51 (95% CI : 0.44 to 0.61) and low heterogeneity, and there was no evidence that indicated that 1 active treatment was superior to another when compared indirectly. The author s noted that there was insufficient 117 Data as of May 22, 2020 JE-U/JA-U/KMR Page 12 of 37 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Four of the trials had open -label extension studies performed over 5 to 10 years, all of which indicated that early DMT therapy (regardless of agent) led to an increase in time to CDMS when compared with placebo (HR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.55 to 0.74; low heterogeneity). These results should be taken with caution; however, as all of the open- label extension arms were at a high risk for attrition bias and had large losses to follow -up noted. o The TOPIC study enrolled 618 patients with CIS and found teriflunomi de 7 and 14 mg doses reduced the risk of relapse defining CDMS co mpared to placebo (Miller et al 2014) . Teriflunomide 14 mg reduced the risk of conversion to CDMS by 42.6% compared to placebo (HR, 0.574; p = 0.0087) 7 mg reduced the conversion to CDMS by 37.2% compared to placebo (HR, 0.628; 95% CI: 0.416 to 0.949; p = 0.0271). Progressive MS Limited treatment options are available for patients with non-active SPMS and PPMS. Mitoxantrone is FDA -approved for treating SPMS, while ocrelizumab has been specifically approved for the treatment of PPMS (and relapsing forms of MS). Mitoxantrone was shown to reduce the clinical relapse rate and disease progression in aggressive RRMS, SPMS, and PRMS (Hartung et al 2002, Krapf et al 2005). For MRI outcome measures, mitoxantrone was not statistically significantly different than placebo at month 12 or 24 for the total number of MRI scans with positive Gd-enhancement or at month 12 for the number of lesions on T2- weighted MRI. However, the baseline MRI lesion number and characteristics were different among the groups (Krapf et al 2005) . In 2010, the Therapeutics and Technology Assessment Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology evaluated all published data, including cohort data, for mitoxantrone. An evaluation of efficacy found that mitoxantrone is probably effective in modestly reducing clinical at tack rate, MRI activity, and disease progression. A confirmatory trial is necessary before widespread adoption of mitoxantrone for DMT for MS can be made in light of the risks of cardiotoxicity and treatment -related leukemia (Marriott et al 2010) . The results of studies with the other agents for MS have failed to consistently demonstrate a benefit in progressive forms of MS. In the PROMISE trial, glatiramer acetate was no more effective than placebo in delaying the time to accumulated disability for patien ts with PPMS (Wolinsky et al 2007) . Results from the ASCEND trial, evaluating natalizumab in SPMS, found no significant difference in the rate of confirmed disability progression compared to placebo ( Kapoor et al 2018). Several IFN trials in this population have yielded conflicting results (Rizvi et al 2004) . A systematic analysis evaluated 5 clinical trials (N = 3082) of IFN compared to placebo in the treatment of SPMS. In 4 trials with the primary outcome of sustained disability progression at 3 or 6 months , IFN demonstrated no benefit. The risk ratio for sustained progression with IFN was 0.98 (95% CI: was high (I2 = 57%) (La Mantia et al 2013) . Timing of DMT initiation A 2017 systematic review by Merkel et al (2017) evaluated the effect of high-efficacy immunotherapies (ie, fingolimod, natalizumab, alemtuzumab) at different stages of MS . Twelve publications (9 RCTs + 3 observational studies) were identified as reporting information relevant to the outcomes of early vs delayed initiation of high- efficacy DMTs for RRMS. A number of these studies suggested that earlier commencement of high -efficacy DMTs resulted in more effective control of relapse activity than their later initiation. The evidence regarding the effect of the timing of high- efficacy therapies on disability outcomes was conflicting; additional data are required to answer this question. Decisions to discontinue DMTs in MS Patient s with RRMS eventually progress to SPMS. Patients experience worsening disability with or without relapses. Current therapies focus on relapsing forms of MS and are not indicated for non-active SPMS. The decision to discontinue DMTs has not been well studied. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) published a comparative effectiveness review evaluating the decision dilemmas surrounding discontinuation of MS therapies in the setting of progressive disease and pregnancy (Butler et al 2015). No studies directly assess continued therapy vs discontinued therapy for MS in comparable populations. Based on a low strength of evidence, long- term all -cause survival is higher for treatment -na\u00efve MS patients who did not delay starting IFN -1b by 2 years and used DMT for a longer duration than those who delayed therapy. Very little evidence is available about the benefits and risks of discontinuation of therapy for MS in women who desire pregnancy ( Rae-Grant et al 2018 ). 118 Data as of May 22, 2020 JE-U/JA-U/KMR Page 13 of 37 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Meta -Analyses A 2017 systematic review conducted by the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) included ocrelizumab in a comparative efficacy analysis with other DMTs used in the treatment of MS. o Network meta- analyses demonstrated that for the treatment of RRMS, alemtuzumab, natalizumab, and ocrelizumab (in that order) were the most effective DMTs for reducing ARRs (~70% reduction vs placebo). o Ocrelizumab and alemtuzumab had the greatest reductions in disability progression (53% to 58% reduction vs placebo, respectively), closely followed by natalizumab (44%). A systematic review that identified 28 RCTs found that the magnitude of ARR reduction varied between 15 to 36% for all IFN products, glatiramer acetate, and teriflunomide; for dimethyl fumarate, fingolimod, and natalizumab. The risk of 3-month disability progression was reduced by 19 to 28% with IFN produc ts, glatiramer et al 2016) . A total of 39 RCTs evaluating 1 of 15 treatments for MS were analyzed for benefits and acceptability in 25,113 patients with RRMS (Tramacere et al 2015) . Drug s included and laquinimod, were also included. The studies had a median duration of 24 months with 60% of studies being placebo- controlled. The network meta- analysis evaluated the recurrence of relapses and disability progression. o Relapses: alemtuzumab, mitoxantrone, natalizumab, and fingolimod were reported to have greater treatment benefit compared to placebo. Over 12 months (29 studies; N = 17,897): alemtuzumab : RR = 95% CI: 0.20 to 0.76; low quality evidence natalizumab: RR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.43 to 0.73; high quality evidence fingolimod: RR = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.53 to 0.74; evidence = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.65 to 0.93; moderate quality evidence daclizumab (no longer on the market) : RR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.61 to 0.68 to 0.93; moderate quality evidence o Relapses over 24 months vs placebo (26 studies; N = 16,800): alemtuzumab : RR = CI: 0.27 to 0.81; = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.47 to 0.66; 0.72, 95% CI: 0.64 to 0.81; moderate quality evidence o Disability worsening over 24 months vs placebo (26 studies; N = 16,800): mitoxantrone: RR = 0.20, 95% CI: 0.05 to 0.84; low quality evidence alemtuzumab : RR = 0.35, 95% CI: 0.26 to 0.48; quality 0.64, 95% CI: 0.49 to 0.85; moderate quality evidence o Relapses and disability worsening over 36 months were only tested in 2 studies (CombiRx and CAMMS223). Both studies had a high risk of bias. o Acceptability: Higher rates of withdrawal due to adverse events compared to placebo over 12 months were repo rted for teriflunomide (RR = 8.26, 95% CI: 3.25 to 20.97). o Over 24 months, only fingolimod had a significantly higher proportion of participants who withdrew due to any adverse event (RR vs placebo = 1.69, 95% CI: 1.32 to 2.17). CI: 0.32 to 1.61 Filippini et al (2013) conducted a Cochrane review of 44 RCTs on the relative effectiveness and acceptabili ty of DMTs and immunosuppressants in patients with either RRMS or progressive MS (N = 17,401). o On the basis of high quality evidence, natalizumab and Rebif were superior to all other treatments for preventing clinical relapses in the short -term (24 months) in RRMS compared to placebo (OR = 0.32, 95% CI: 0.24 to 0.43; OR = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.28 to 0.71, respectively); they were also more effective than Avonex (OR = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.22 to 0.36; OR = 0.19, 95% CI: 0.06 to 0.6, respectively). 119 Data as of May 22, 2020 JE-U/JA-U/KMR Page 14 of 37 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. o Based on moderate quality evidence, natalizumab and Rebif decreased the odds of patients with RRMS having disability progression in the short -term, with an absolute reduction of 14% and 10%, respectively, vs placebo. o Natalizumab and Betaseron were significantly more effective (OR = 0.62, CI: 0.49 to 0.78; OR = 0.35, 95% CI: 0.17 to 0.7, respectively) than Avonex in reducing the number of patients with RRMS who had progression at 2 years of follow -up, and confidence in this result was graded as moderate. o The lack of convincing efficacy data showed that Avonex, IV immunoglobulins (IVIG), cyclophosphamide, and long- term corticosteroids have an unfavorable benefit -risk b alance in RRMS. The Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) conducted a systematic review of 30 RCTs to assess the comparative clinical - and cost -effectiveness of drug therapies for the treatment of RRMS (N = 16,998) (CADTH 2013). Resu lts suggested that all active treatments produce statistically significant reductions in ARR compared with no treatment, and that there were clear between -treatment differences. o Compared with no treatment, reductions in the ARR were approximately 70% for natalizumab and alemtuzumab , to 0.93) compared with glatiramer acetate. o Compared with placebo, all active treatments exhibited a lower risk of sustained disability progression, but results were only statistically significant for Avonex, Rebif, natalizumab, fingolimod, teriflunomide, and dimethyl fumarate; agents ranged from 0.59 (95% C I: 0.46 to 0.96) for teriflunomide. Between -treatment differences were less apparent. o Among active comparisons, the risk of sustained disability progression was statistically lower for alemtuzumab (0.59, 95% C I: 0.40 CI: 0.2 to 0.80) compared with Avonex. o Among active comparisons, MRI findings were more favorable for alemtuzumab compared with Rebif, and more favorable for all 3 of fingolimod, Betaseron, and Rebif compared with Avonex. Compared with glatiramer acetate, Tecfidera resulted in a lower mean number of T2 lesions, but the mean number of Gd- enhancing lesions was not statistically different between these 2 treatments. o The incidence of serious adverse events and treatment discontinuations did not differ significantly between treatments in the majority of trials, except for a higher incidence of treatment discontinuation for Rebif compared to placebo and alemtuzumab . Hamidi et al (2018) conducted a systematic review and network meta -analysis of 37 studies including 26 RCTs from a health technology assessment (HTA) report and 11 supplemental RCTs published after the HTA . were included and were compared to either placebo or any drug treatment in patients of varying treatment experience levels . Key findings from the network meta -analysis include: o Alemtuzumab 12 mg had the highest probability of preventing annual relap ses (RR = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.35; high quality evidence). o Alemtuzumab 24 mg (RR = 0.36, 95% CI: 0.16 to 0.7; low quality evidence) and al emtuzum ab 12 mg (RR = 0.40, 95% CI: 0.27 to 0.60; very low quality evidence) were the most effective against progression of disability . o Dimethyl fumarate 240 mg and fingolimod 0.5 mg and 1. 25 mg were more effective treatments when considering annual relapse and disability progression: Annual relapse: Dimethyl fumarate 0.42 to 0.6; = 0.45, 95% CI: high evidence Disability progression: mg daily: RR = 0.49 to 0.85; = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.56 to 0.90; high quality evidence o Withdrawal due to adverse events was difficult to assess due to the low quality of available evidence, however, the authors determined that: Fingolimod 1.25 mg ( RR = 2.21, 95% CI: to 2.5; moderate mcg (RR = 2.21, 95% CI: 1.29 to 3.97; low quality evidence) were associated with higher withdrawals due to adverse events when compared with other treatment options. 120 Data as of May 22, 2020 JE-U/JA-U/KMR Page 15 of 37 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. o Alemtuzumab 24 mg (mean difference = - 0.91; 95% CI: -1.48 to -0.40), and - 0.6; 95% CI: -1.02 to -0.24) were more effective than other therapies in lowering the EDSS. o No treatments were found to significantly increase serious adverse events; peginterferon -1a was associated with more adverse events overall when compared with other medications (RR = 1.66, 95% CI: 1.21 to 2.28). o None of the 11 agents studied were associated with a statistically significantly higher risk of mortality when compared to placebo. A Bayesian network meta -analysis evaluating DMTs for RRMS ranked the most effective therapies based on SUCRA analysis ( Lucchetta et al 2018). A total of 33 studies were included in the analysis. For the ARR, alemtuzumab (96% probability), natalizumab (96%), and ocrelizumab (85%) were determined to be the most effective therapies (high -quality evidence). A meta -analysis of randomized controlled trials was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of teriflunomide in reducing the frequency of relapses and progression of physical disability in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis (Xu et al 2016) . The results showed that t eriflunomide (7 and 14 mg) reduced the ARR and teriflunomide 14 mg decreased the disability progression in comparison to placebo (RR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.55 to 0.87). CLINICAL GUIDELINES The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) performed a systematic review that included 20 Cochrane reviews and 73 additional articles in order to assess the available evidence on initiation, switching, and stopping DMTs in patients with MS ( Rae Grant et al 2018[a]). The results of the systematic review were used to assist in formulating updated AAN treatment guidelines ( Rae Grant et al 2018[b]). The main recommendations were as follows: o Starting DMT Clinicians should discuss the benets and risks of DMTs for people with a single clinical demyelinating event with 2 or more brain lesions that have imaging characteri stics consistent with MS (Level B). After discussing the risks and benets, clinicians should prescribe DMTs to people with a single clinical demyelinating event and 2 or more brain lesions characteristic of MS who decide they want this therapy. (Level B) Clinicians should offer DMTs to people with relapsing forms of MS with recent clinical relapses or MRI activity. (Level B) Clinicians should monitor the reproductive plans of women with MS and counsel regarding reproductive risks and use of birth control during DMT in women of childbearing potential who have MS. (Level B) Clinicians should counsel men with MS on their reproductive plans regarding treatment implications before initiating treatment with teriflunomide. (Level B) Because of the high frequency of severe adverse events, clinicians should not prescribe mitoxantrone to people with MS unless the potential therapeutic benets greatly outweigh the risks. (Level B) Clinicians should prescribe alemtuzumab, ngolimod, or natalizumab for people with highly active MS. (Level B) Clinicians may initiate natalizumab treatment in people with MS with positive anti -JCV antibody indices above 0.9 only when there is a reasonable chance of benet compared with the low but serious risk of PML. (Level C) Clinicians shou ld offer ocrelizumab to people with PPMS who are likely to benet from this therapy unless there are risks of treatment that outweigh the benets. (Level B) o Switching DMTs Clinicians should discuss switching from one DMT to another in people with MS who have been using a DMT long enough for the treatment to take full effect and are adherent to their therapy when they experience 1 or more relapses, 2 or more unequivocally new MRI -detected lesions, or increased disability on examination, over a 1- year period of using a DMT. (Level B) Clinicians should evaluate the degree of disease activity, adherence, adverse event proles, and mechanism of action of DMTs when switching DMTs in people with MS with breakthrough disease activity during DMT use. (Level B) Clinic ians should discuss a change to non- injectable or less frequently injected DMTs in people with MS who report intolerable discomfort with the injections or in those who report injection fatigue on injectable DMTs. (Level B) Clinicians should inquire about medication adverse events with people with MS who are taking a DMT and attempt to manage these adverse events, as appropriate (Level B). Clinicians should discuss a medication switch with people with MS for whom these adverse events negatively influence adherence. (Level B) Clinicians should monitor laboratory abnormalities found on requisite laboratory surveillance (as outlined in the medication's package insert) in people with MS who are using a DMT (Level B). Clinicians should discuss switching 121 Data as of May 22, 2020 JE-U/JA-U/KMR Page 16 of 37 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx. It is intended for internal use only and should be disseminated only to authorized recipients.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. DMTs or reducing dosage or frequency (where there are data on different doses [eg, interferons, teriflunomide]) when there are persistent laboratory abnormalities. (Level B) Clinicians should counsel people with MS considering natalizumab, ngolimod, ocrelizumab, and dimethyl fumarate about the PML risk associated with these agents (Level B). Clinicians should discuss switching to a DMT with a lower PML risk with people with MS taking natalizumab who are or who become JCV antibody -positive, especially with an index of above 0.9 while on therapy. (Level B) Clinicians should counsel that new DMTs without long- term safety data have an undened risk of malignancy and infection for people with MS starting or using new DMTs (Level B). If a patient with MS develops a malignancy while using a DMT, clinicians should promptly discuss switching to an alternate DMT, especially for people with MS using ngolimod, teriflunomide, alemtuzumab, or dimethyl fumarate (Level B). People with MS with serious infections potentially linked to their DMTs should switch DMTs (does not pertain to PML management in people with MS using DMT). (Level B) Clinicians should check for natalizumab antibodies in people with MS who have infusion reactions before subsequent infusions, or in people with MS who experience breakthrough disease activity with natalizumab use (Level B). Clinicians should switch DMTs in people with MS who have persistent natalizumab antibodies. (Level B) Physicians must counsel people with MS considering natalizumab discontinuation that there is an increased risk of MS relapse or MRI -detected disease activity within 6 months of discontinuation (Level A). Physicians and people with MS choosing to switch from natalizumab to ngolimod should initiate treatment within 8 to 12 weeks after natalizumab discontinuation (for reasons other than pregnancy or pregnancy planning) to diminish the return of disease activity. (Level B) Clinicians should counsel women to stop their DMT before conception for planned pregnancies unless the risk of MS activity during pregnancy outweighs the risk associated with the specic DMT during pregnancy (Level B). Clinicians should discontinue DMTs during pregnancy if accidental exposure occurs, unless the risk of MS activity during pregnancy outweighs the risk associated with the specic DMT during pregnancy (Level B). Clinicians should not initiate DMTs during pregnancy unless the risk of MS activity during pregnancy outweighs the risk associated with the specic DMT during pregnancy. (Level B) o Stopp ing DMTs In people with RRMS who are stable on DMT and want to discontinue therapy, clinicians should counsel people regarding the need for ongoing follow- up and periodic reevaluation of the decision to discontinue DMT (Level B). Clinicians should advocate that people with MS who are stable (that is, those with no relapses, no disability progression, and stable imaging) on DMT should continue their current DMT unless the patient and physician decide a trial off therapy is warranted. (Level B) Clinicians sho uld assess the likelihood of future relapse in individuals with SPMS by assessing patient age, disease duration, relapse history, and MRI -detected activity (eg, frequency, severity, time since most recent relapse or gadolinium -enhanced lesion) (Level B). Clinicians may advise discontinuation of DMT in people with SPMS who do not have ongoing relapses (or gadolinium enhanced lesions on MRI activity) and have not been ambulatory (EDSS 7 or greater) for at least 2 years. (Level C) Clinicians should review the associated risks of continuing DMTs vs those of stopping DMTs in people with CIS using DMTs who have not been diagnosed with MS. (Level B) In September 2019, the MS Coalition published an update to its consensus paper on the principles and current evidence concerning the use of DMTs in MS (MS Coalition 2019). Major recommendations included the following: o Initiation of treatment with an FDA -approved DMT is recommended as soon as possible following a diagnosis of relapsing MS, regardless of the person's age. Relapsing MS includes CIS, RRMS, and active SPMS with clinical relapses or inflammatory activity on MRI. o Clinicians should consider prescribing a high efficacy medication such as alemtuzumab, cladribine, fingolimod, ocrelizumab or natalizumab for newly diagnosed individuals with highly active MS. o Clinicians should also consider prescribing a high efficacy medication for patients who have breakthrough activity on another DMT, regardless of the number of previously used agents. o Treatment with a given DMT should be continued indefinitely unless any of the following occur (in which case an alternative DMT should be considered): Suboptimal treatment response as determined by the individual and his or her treating clinician Intolerable side effects Inadequate adherence to the treatment regimen Availability of a more appropriate treatment option 122 Data as of May 22, 2020 JE-U/JA-U/KMR Page 17 of 37 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx. It is intended for internal use only and should be disseminated only to authorized recipients. The contents of the therapeutic class overviews on this website (\"Content\") are for informational purposes only. The Content is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Patients should always seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health provider with any questions regarding a medical condition. Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. The healthcare provider and patient determine that the benefits no longer outweigh the risks. o Movement from one DMT to another should occur only for medically appropriate reasons as determined by the treating clinician and patient. o When evidence of additional clinical or MRI activity while on treatment suggests a sub- optimal response, an alternative regimen (eg, different mechanism of action) should be considered to optimize therapeutic benefit. o The factors affecting choice of therapy at any point in the disease course are complex and most appropriately analyzed and addressed through a shared decision- making process between the patient and his/her treating clinician. Neith er an arbitrary restriction of choice nor a mandatory escalation therapy approach is supported by data. o Due to significant variability in the MS population, people with MS and their treating clinicians require access to the full range of treatment options for several reasons: MS clinical phenotypes may respond differently to different DMTs. Different mechanisms of action allow for treatment change in the event of a sub- optimal response. Potential contraindications limit options for some individuals. Risk to lerance varies among people with MS and their treating clinicians. Route of delivery, frequency of dosing, and side effects may affect adherence and quality of life. Individual differences related to tolerability and adherence may necessitate access to different medications within the same class. Pregnancy and breastfeeding limit the available options. o Individuals' access to treatment should not be limited by their frequency of relapses, level of disability, or personal characteristics such as age, sex, or ethnicity. o Absence of relapses while on treatment is a characteristic of treatment effectiveness and should not be considered a justification for discontinuation of treatment. Treatment should not be withheld during determination of coverage by payors as this puts the patient at risk for recurrent disease activity. The European Committee for Research and Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) and the European Academy of Neurology (EAN) published updated guidelines in 2018 ( Montalban et al 2018 ). The main recommendations reported were the following: o The entire sp ectrum of DMT s should be prescribed only in centers with adequate infrastructure to provide proper monitoring of patients, comprehensive patient assessment, detection of adverse effects, and the capacity to address adverse effects properly if they occur. (Consensus sta tement) o Offer IFN or glatiramer acetate to patients with CIS and abnormal MRI findings with lesions suggesting MS who do not fulfill full criteria for MS. (Strong) o Offer early treatment with DMTs in patients with active RRMS, as defined by clinical relapses and/or MRI activity (active lesions: contrast -enhancing lesions; new or unequivocally enlarging T2 lesions assessed at least annually). (Strong) o For active RRMS, choosing among the wide range of available drugs from the modestly to highly effective will depend on patient characteristics and comorbidity, disease severity /activity , drug safety profile, and accessibility of the drug. (Consensus statement) o Consider treatment with IFN in patients with active SPMS, taking into account, in discussion with the patient, the dubious efficacy, as well as the safety and tolerability profile. (Weak) o Consider treatment with mitoxantrone in patients with active SPMS, taking into account the efficacy and specifically the safety and tolerability profile of this agent. (Wea k) o Consider ocrelizumab for patients with active SPMS. (Weak) o Consider ocrelizumab for patients with PPMS. ( Weak ) o Always consult the summary of product characteristics for dosage, special warnings, precautions, contraindications, and monitoring of side effects and potential harms. (Consensus statement) o Consider combining MRI with clinical measures when evaluating disease evolution in treated patients. (Weak) o When monitoring treatment response in patients treated with DMTs, perform standardized reference brain MRI within 6 months of treatment onset and compare the results with those of further brain MRI, typically performed 12 months after starting treatment. Adjust the timing of both MRIs, taking into account the drug's mechanism and speed of action and disease activity, including clinical and MRI measures. (Consensus statement) o When monitoring treatment response in patients treated with DMTs, the measurement of new or unequivocally enlarging T2 lesions is the preferred MRI method, supplemented by Gd-enhancin g lesions for monitoring treatment response. Evaluation of these parameters requires high-quality standardized MRI scans and interpretation by highly qualified readers with experience in MS. (Consensus statement) 123 Data as of May 22, 2020 JE-U/JA-U/KMR Page 18 of 37 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx. It is intended for internal use only and should be disseminated only to authorized recipients. The contents of the therapeutic class overviews on this website (\"Content\") are for informational purposes only. The Content is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Patients should always seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health provider with any questions regarding a medical condition. Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. o When monitoring treatment safety in patient s treated with DMT s, perform a standard reference MRI every year in patients at low risk for PML, and more frequently (3 to 6 months) in patients at high risk for PML (JC virus positivity, natalizumab treatment duration over 18 months) and in patients at high risk for PML who switch drugs at the time the current treatment is discontinued and the new treatment is started. (Consensus statement) o Offer a more efficacious drug to patients treated with IFN or glatiramer acetate who show evidence of disease activi ty, assessed as recommended above. (Strong) o When deciding on which drug to switch to, in consultation with the patient, consider patient characteristics and comorbidities, drug safety profile, and disease severity/activity. (Consensus statement) o When treatment with a highly efficacious drug is stopped, whether due to inefficacy or safety, consider starting another highly efficacious drug. When starting the new drug, take into account disease activity (clinical and MRI; the greater the disease activity, the greater the urgency to start new treatment), the half -life and biological activity of the previous drug, and the potential for resumed disease activity or even rebound (particularly with natalizumab). (Consensus statement) o Consider continuing a DMT if the patient is stable (clinically and on MRI) and shows no safety or tolerability issues. (Weak) o Advise all women of childbearing potential that DMT s are not licensed during pregnancy, except glatiramer acetate 20 mg/mL . (Consensus statement) o For women planning a pregnancy, if there is a high risk for disease reactivation, consider using IFN or glatiramer acetate until pregnancy is confirmed. In some very specific (active) cases, continuing this treatment during pregnancy could also be considered. (Weak) o For women with persistent high disease activity, it would generally be advised to delay pregnancy. For those who still decide to become pregnant or have an unplanned pregnancy, treatment with natalizumab throughout pregnancy may be considered after full discussio n of potential implications; treatment with alemtuzumab could be an alternative for planned pregnancy in very active cases provided that a 4-month interval is strictly observed from the latest infusion until conception. (Weak) According to the 2013 Canadian recommendations for treatment of MS, treatment decisions should be based on the level of concern for the rate and severity of relapses, degree of functional impairment due to relapses , and disability progression. First -line treatment re commendations for RRMS include IFN products and glatiramer acetate. Second -line therapies for RRMS include fingolimod and natalizumab (Freedman et al 2013) . The 2015 Association of British Neurologists state that all available DMT s are effective in reducing relapse rate and MRI lesion accumulation (Scolding et al 2015) . Evidence is less clear on the impact of DMT on long -term disability. Drugs are separated into 2 categories based on relative efficacy. Category 1 - moderate efficacy includes IFNs (including peginterferon ), glatiramer acetate, teriflunomide, dimethyl - high efficacy includes alemtuzumab and natalizumab - these drugs should be reserved for patients with very active MS. SAFETY SUMMA RY Warnings for IFN include decreased peripheral blood cell counts including leukopenia, higher rates of depression, suicide and psychotic disorders, injection site reactions, anaphylaxis, congestive heart failure (CHF), potential development of autoimmune disorders (eg, lupus erythematosus), nfluenza -like symptoms including musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and headache. All IFN products carry a warning for thrombotic microangiopathy including thrombotic thrombocytopeni c purpura to IFN thera py appear to be dose- related and transient. Glatiramer acetate is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to glatiramer acetate or mannitol. Patients treated with glatiramer acetate may experience a transient, self -limited, post-injection reaction of flushing, chest pain, palpitations, tachycardia, anxiety, dyspnea, constriction of the throat , or urticaria immediately following the injection . Injection site reactions including lipoatrophy and skin necrosis have been reported. Because glatira mer acetate can modify immune response, it may interfere with immune functions. In controlled studies of glatiramer acetate 20 mg/mL, the most common adverse reactions ( 10% and 1.5 times higher than placebo) were injection site reactions, vasodilatation, rash, dyspnea, and chest pain. In a controlled study of glatiramer acetate 40 mg/mL, the most common adverse reactions ( 10% and 1.5 times higher than placebo) were injection site reactions. Fingolimod is contraindicated in patients with a variety of cardiac issues and those with a hypersensitivity to the product. Because of a risk for bradyarrhythmia and atrioventricular ( AV) blocks, patients should be monitored during Gilenya 124 Data as of May 22, 2020 JE-U/JA-U/KMR Page 19 of 37 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Patients should always seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health provider with any questions regarding a medical condition. Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. treatment initiation. In controlled clinical trials, first -degree AV block after the first dose occurred in 4.7% of patients receiving Gilenya and 1.6% of patients on placebo. o Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) has been reported with fingolimod. Patients with pre- existing cardiac disease may poorly tolerate fingolimod and may require additional monitoring. In clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions (incidence 10% and > placebo) were headache, liver transaminase elevation, diarrhea, cough, influenza, sinusitis, back pain, abdominal pain, and pain in extremity. If a serious infection develops, consider suspending fingolimod and reassess risks and benefits prior to re -initiation. Elimination of the drug may take up to 2 months thus, monitoring for infections should continue during this time. Do not start fingolimod in patients with an active acute or chronic infection until the infection is resolved. Life-threatening and fatal infections have been reported in patients taking fingolimod. Establish immunity to varicella zoster virus prior to therapy initiation. Vaccination against human papilloma virus (HPV) should be considered before initiating treatment with fingolimod; HPV infections including papilloma, dysplasia, warts, and HPV -related cancer have been reported in post marketing reports. Recent safety labeling changes warn of an increased risk of cutaneous malignancies, including melanoma, and lymphoma in patients treated with fingolimod. C linically significant hepatic injury has occurred in patients treated with fingolimod in the postmarketing setting; hepatic function should be monitored prior to, during, and until 2 months after medication discontinuation. Cases of PML have occurred in the postmarketing setting, primarily in patients who were treated with fingolimod for at least 2 years. At the first sign or symptom suggestive of PML, fingolimod should be withheld and an appropriate diagnostic evaluation performed. Monitoring for signs consistent with PML on MRI may be useful to allow for an early diagnosis. Additionally, severe increases in disability after discontinuation of fingolimod have been described in post marketing reports. Relapses of MS with tumefactive demyelinating lesions on imaging have been observed both during therapy with fingolimod and after discontinuation in post marketing reports. If a severe MS relapse occurs during or after discontinuation of treatment with fingolimod, tumefactive MS should be considered, and imaging evaluation and initiation of appropriate treatment may be necessary . Teriflunomide is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment; pregnancy , those with a history of hypersensitivity to the medication, women of childbearing potential who are not using reliable contraception; and with concurrent use of leflunomide. Labeling includes boxed warnings regarding hepatotoxicity and teratogenicity/embryolethality that occurred in animal reproduction studies at plasma teriflunomide exposures similar to or lower than in humans. Other warnings include bone marrow effects, immunosuppression leading to potential infections, malignancy risk , interstitial lung disease, peripheral neuropathy, severe skin reactions, and elevated bloo d pressure. Teriflunomide has a half -life of 4 to 5 months; therefore, use of activated charcoal or cholestyramine in an 11 - day regimen upon discontinuation of teriflunomide is recommended to reduce serum levels more rapidly . The most common adverse reacti ons ( 10% and 2% greater than placebo) are headache, diarrhea, nausea, alopecia, and an increase in contraindicated in patients with hyper sensitivity to the product s or any of their excipients. Warnings include anaphylaxis and angioedema, PML, lymphopenia , and clinically significant cases of liver injury . Serious cases of herpes zoster and other opportunistic viral (eg, herpe Nile tuberculosis ) have been reported in patients treated with dimethyl fumarate, and may occur at any time during treatment with dimethyl fumarate, diroximel fumarate, or monomethyl fumarate. Patients with signs/symptoms of any of these infections should undergo diagnostic evaluation and receive appropriate treatment; treatment with dimethyl fumarate , diroximel fumarate, or monomethyl fumarate may need to be withheld until the infection has resolved. Consider therapy interruption if severe lymphopenia for more than 6 months occurs. Cases of PML have been reported following therapy. Monitoring for signs consistent with PML on MRI may be useful to allow for an early diagnosis. Common adverse events (incidence 10% and 2% more than placebo) were flushing, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and nausea. Administration of non-enteric aspirin up to 325 mg given 30 minutes prior to each dose or a temporary dose reduction may reduce flushing. Diroximel fumarate should not be coadministered with dimethyl fumarate. Natalizumab has a boxed warning regarding the risk of PML. PML is an opportunistic viral infection of the brain that usually leads to death or severe disability. Due to the risk of PML, natalizumab is only available through the TOUCH\u00ae Prescribing Program , which is a restricted distribution program. Natalizumab is contraindicated in patients who have or have had PML and in patients who have had a hypersensitivity reaction. The most common adverse reactions (incidence 10% in MS ) were headache, fatigue, arthralgia, urinary tract infection, lower respiratory tract infection, gastroenteritis, vaginitis, depression, pain in extremity, abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, and rash. Monitoring for signs consistent with PML on MRI may be useful to allow for an early diagnosis. Other warnings with natalizumab include 125 Data as of May 22, 2020 JE-U/JA-U/KMR Page 20 of 37 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. hypersensitivit y reactions, increased risk of h erpes encephalitis and meningitis, increased risk of infections (including opportunistic infections), and hepatotoxicity. Mitoxantrone has boxed warnings for the risk of cardiotoxicity, risk of bone marrow suppression, and secondary leukemia. C ongestive heart failure, potentially fatal, may occur either during therapy with mitoxantrone or months to years after termination of therapy. The maximum cumulative lifetime dose of mitoxantrone for MS patients should not exceed 140 mg/kg/m2. Monitoring of cardiac function is required prior to all mitoxantrone doses. Alemtuzumab is contraindicated in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The boxed warning for alemtuzumab includes autoimmunity conditions (immune thrombocytopenia, autoimmune hepatitis, and anti -glomerular basement membrane disease), serious and life-threatening infusion reactions, serious and life- threatening stroke within 3 days of administration, and the possibility of an increased risk of malignancies (ie, thyroid cancer, melanoma, and lymphoproliferative disorders/lymphoma). Alemtuzumab is only available through a restricted distribution and REMS program , which requires the member, provider, pharmacy , and infusion facility to be certified. Approximately one -third of patients who received alemtuzumab in clinical trials developed thyroid disorders. The most commonly reported adverse events reported in at least 10% of alemtuzumab -treated patients and more frequently than with IFN-1a were rash, headache, pyrexia, nasopharyngitis, nausea, urinary tract infection, fatigue, insomnia, upper respiratory tract infection, herpes viral infection, urticaria, pruritus, thyroid disorders, fungal infection, arthralgia, in extremity, back pain, diarrhea, sinusitis, oropharyngeal pain, paresthesia, dizziness, abdominal pain, flushing, and vomiting. Nearly all patients (99.9%) in clinical trials had lymphopenia following a treatment course of alemtuzumab. Alemtuzumab may also increase the risk of acute acalculous cholecystitis; in controlled clinical studies, 0.2% of alemtuzumab- treated MS patients developed acute acalculous cholecystitis, compared to 0% of patients treated with IFN-1a. During postmarketing use, additional cases of acute acalculous cholecystitis have been reported in alemt uzumab -treated patients. Other safety concerns within the product labeling include a warning that patients administered alemtuzumab are at risk for serious infections , including those caused by Listeria monocytogenes , the potential development of pneumonitis, and PML. Patients that are prescribed alemtuzumab should be counseled to avoid or appropriately heat any foods that may be a source of Listeria , such as deli meat s and unpasteurized cheeses. Patients should also undergo tuberculosis screening according to local guidelines. With regard to PML, alemtuzumab should be withheld, and appropriate diagnostic evaluations performed, at the initial occurrence of suggestive signs or symptoms. The labeling of ocrelizumab does not contain any boxed warnings; however, ocrelizumab is contraindicated in patients with active hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and in those with a history of life- threatening infusion reactions to ocrelizumab. Additional warnings for ocrelizumab concern infusion reactions, infections, and an increased risk of malignancies. o As of June 30, 2016, the overall incidence rate of first neoplasm among ocrelizumab- treated patients across all 3 pivotal studies and a Phase 2, dose -finding study (Kappos et al [2011]) was 0.40 per 100 patient -years of exposure to ocrelizumab (6467 patient -years of exposure) vs 0.20 per 100 patient -years of exposure in the pooled comparator groups (2053 patient -years of exposure in groups receiving Rebif or placebo) (Hauser et al 2017, Ocrevus Formulary Submission Dossier 2017) . Since breast cancer occurred in 6 out of 781 females treated with ocrelizumab ( vs in none of 668 females treated with Rebif or placebo), the labeling of ocrelizumab additionally recommends that patients follow standard breast cancer screening guidelines. In related postmarketing requirements, the FDA has asked the manufacturer to conduct a prospective, longitudinal, observational study in adult patients with relapsing MS and PPMS exposed to ocrelizumab to determine the inciden ce and mortality rates of breast cancer and all malignancies. All patients enrolled in the study need to be followed for a minimum of 5 years or until death following their first exposure to ocrelizumab and the protocol must specify 2 appropriate populations to which the observed incidence and mortality rates will be compared (FDA approval letter 2017). o No cases of PML have been reported to date in any studies of ocrelizumab ( Hauser et al 2017, McGinley et al 2017, Ocrevus Su bmission Dossier 2017). o In patients with relapsing MS, the most common adverse reactions with ocrelizumab (incidence 10% and greater than Rebif) were upper respiratory tract infections and infusion reactions. In patients with PPMS, the most common adverse reactions (incidence 10% and greater than placebo) were upper respiratory tract infections, infusion reactions, skin infections, and lower respiratory tract infections. o Live or live -attenuated vaccines should not be administered until B -cell coun t recovery is confirmed ( as measured by CD19+ B -cells) in infants born from mothers who were exposed to ocrelizumab during pregnancy. 126 Data as of May 22, 2020 JE-U/JA-U/KMR Page 21 of 37 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Dalfampridine is contraindicated in patients with a history of seizure, moderate or severe renal impairment (CrCl 50 mL/min), and a history of hypersensitivity to dalfampridine or 4-aminopyridine. Dalfampridine may cause seizures; permanently discontinue this medication in patients who have a seizure while on treatment. Dalfampridine can also cause anaphylaxis; signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis have included respiratory compromise, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat and or tongue. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) were reported more frequently as an adverse reaction in controlled studies in patients receiving dalfampridine 10 mg twice daily (12%) as compared to placebo (8%). The most common adverse events (incidence 2% and at a rate greater than the placebo rate) for dalfampridine were UTI, insomnia, dizziness, headache, nausea, asthenia, back pain, balance disorder, MS relapse, paresthesia, nasopharyngitis, constipation, dyspepsia, and pharyngolaryngeal a 2C9*3/*3 genotype, presence of Mobitz type II second- degree, third degree AV block or sinus syndrome. It is also contraindicated in patients that have experienced myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke, transient ischemic attack , Class III/IV heart failure, or decompensated heart failure requiring hospitalization in the past 6 months. Warnings and precautions of s iponimod include an increased infection risk, macular edema, increased blood pressure, bradyarrhythmia and AV conduction delays, decline in pulmonary function, and liver injury. Mayzent may result in a transient decrease in heart rate; titration is required for treatment initiation. Consider resting heart rate with concomitant beta-blocker use; obtain cardiologist consultation before concomitant use with other drugs that decrease heart rate. Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during and for 10 days after stopping siponimod due to fetal risk . The most common adverse events (incidence > 10%) are headache, hypertension, and transaminase increases. Ozanimod is contraindicated in patients that have experienced myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke, transient ischemic attack, Class III/IV heart failure, or decompensated heart failure requiring hospitalization in the past 6 months. It is also contraindicated in patients with Mobitz type II second - or third- degree atrioventricular block, sick sinus syndrome, or sinoatrial attack unless the patient has a functioning pacemaker. Use is also contraindicated in patients with severe, untreated sleep apnea and those taking a monoamine oxidase inhibitor. Warnings and precautions for ozan imod include an increased infection risk, macular edema, increased blood pressure, bradyarrhythmia and AV conduction delays, decline in pulmonary function, and liver injury. Women of childbearing potential should use effecti ve contraception during and for 3 months after stopping ozan imod due to fetal risk. The most common adverse events (incidence > 10%) are upper respiratory tract infections and hepatic transaminase elevations. Zeposia (ozanimod) does not have a recommendati on for first -dose cardiac observation like fingolimod and siponimod. Cladribine is contraindicated in patients with current malignancy, HIV infection, active chronic infection such as hepatitis or tuberculosis, hypersensitivity to cladribine, and in pregnant women. There is a boxed warning for potential malignancy and risk of teratogenicity. The warnings and precautions are lymphopenia, active infection, hematologic toxicity, liver injury, and graft vs host disease with blood transfusion. The most common adverse events (incidence > 20%) are upper respiratory tract infection, headache, and lymphopenia. Table 3 .

CONCLUSION DMTs for MS have shown benefits in patients with relapsing MS such as a decreased relapse rate and a slower accumulation of brain lesions on MRI. Therefore, it is recommended that all patients with a diagnosis of definite relapsing MS begin DMTs (MS Coalition 2019) . IFN products have been shown to decrease MRI lesion activity, prevent relapses, and delay disease progression. In general, patients treated with IFN or glatiramer acetate can expect a 30% reduction in ARR during a 2-year period (MS Coalition 201 9). Head -to-head clinical trials have found IFN and glatiramer acetate to be comparable in terms of efficacy on relapse rate. Several studies have demonstrated an improved tolerability at the cost of a decrease d therapeutic response with low dose IM IFN -1a compared to higher dose SC IFN -1a (Panitch et al 2002, Panitch et al 2005, Schwid et al 2005, Schwid et al 2007, Traboulsee et al 2008) . Influenza- type symp toms, injection site reactions, headache, nausea, and musculoskeletal pain are the most frequently reported adverse events with IFN products. With IFN, use caution in patients with depression or other mood disorders. The adverse effect profile is simil ar among the IFNs. The most frequently reported adverse events with glatiramer acetate include a transient, self -limiting, post -injection systemic reaction immediately following drug administration consisting of flushing, chest pain, palpitations, anxiety, dyspnea, throat constriction, and urticaria. Glatiramer acetate does not have any known drug interactions and is not associated with an increased risk of hepatotoxicity or depression. Glatiramer acetate is generically available. Despite advancements in treatment, many patients fail initial DMTs with glatiramer acetate or IFN, primarily due to intolerable adverse effects or inadequate efficacy (Coyle 2008, Portaccio et al 2008) . Clinical trials have shown that patients switching f rom IFN to glatiramer acetate therapy and vice versa, due to poor response, may achieve a significant reduction in relapse rates and a delay in disease and disability progression (Coyle 2008, Caon et al 2006, Zwibel 2006) . The guidelines suggest that all first-line MS DMTs should be made accessible, and the choice of initial treatment should be based on patient -specific factors (MS Coalition 2017, Scolding et al 2015, Montalban et al 2018). The premature discontinuation rate is high among patients with MS; therefore, factors that will maximize adherence should be considered when initiating therapy. Failure with 1 agent does not necessarily predict failure with another. Therefore, patients experiencing an inadequate response or drug- induced adverse event should be switched to a different DMT (Coyle 2008, Portaccio et al 2008) . There are now 8 available oral agents: Gilenya (fingolimod), which was approved in 2010, Aubagio (teriflunomide), which was approved in 2012, and Tecfidera (dimethyl which was Bafiertam (monomethyl fumarate) w ere approved in 2020. Among other potential benefits, it is expected that the availability of oral agents may increase convenience and improve patient adherence (Sanvito et al 2011) . The available oral drugs each have different mechanisms of action and /or tolerability profiles. The efficacy of the oral products ha s not been directly compared in any head -to-head trials. Cases of PML have been reported in patients taking fingolimod and dimethyl fumarate. Gilenya (fingolimod) is a sphingosine 1- phosphate receptor In a trial comparing fingolimod to placebo, fingolimod -treated patients had a decreased ARR, improved MRI outcomes, and a lower likelihood of disability 137 Data as of May 22, 2020 JE-U/JA-U/KMR Page 32 of 37 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

In a trial comparing fingolimod to IFN -1a IM (Avonex), fingolimod -treated patients had a decreased ARR and improved MRI outcomes, but disability progression was similar in the 2 groups (Cohen et al, 2010). The adverse event profile for fingolimod includes cardiovascular risks including bradycardia. First dose administration of fingolimod requires at least 6 hours of observation with hourly monitoring of heart rate and blood pressure, and patients should have an ECG before dosing and at the end of the observation period. o Fingolimod is also FDA -approved for MS in the pediatric population. In a trial evaluating patients between 10 and 17 years of age, fingolimod significantly reduced ARR and the rate of new or newly enlarged lesions compared to IFN - 1a (Chitnis et al 2018). Mayzent (siponimod) is phosphate receptor modulator , similar to fingolimod . In a tr ial comparing Mayzent to placebo, Mayzent significantly reduced the risk of 3-month CDP, delayed the risk of 6- month CDP, and reduced the ARR (Kappos et al 2018). First dose cardiac monitoring is recommended for patients with a heart rate < 55 bpm or a history of cardiac disease. Siponimod shares many of the same warnings as fingolimod. Zeposia (ozanimod) is another sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator that was approved by the FDA in March 2020. Clinical trials have shown ozanimod to significantly dec rease ARR compared to IFN -1a; however, unlike other drugs in this class it does not require first dose cardiac monitoring ( Comi 2019, Cohen 2019). Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate) has efficacy similar to that of fingolimod ; its benefit -risk profile makes it a reasonable initial or later stage DMT option for most patients with RRMS (CADTH 2013 , Wingerchuk et al 2014). Gastrointestinal intolerance and flushing are common side effects that may wane with time; slow titration to maintenance doses, taking the medication with food, and premedication with aspirin may reduce their severity . Vumerity (diroximel fumarate) is a recently approved oral agent for MS and is rapidly converted to monomethyl fumarate, which is also the active metabolite of fumarate). Diroximel fumarate dimethyl fumarate ( Naismith et Selmaj et al 2 019). Bafiertam (monomethyl fumarate) was approved by the FDA in April 2020 and is considered to be a \"bioequivalent involved in de novo pyrimidine synthesis. Although its exact mechanism of action is unknown, it may involve a reduction in the number of activated lymphocytes in the CNS. Patients treated with teriflunomide in a clinical trial experienced a reduction in the ARR and improved MRI outcomes compared to placebo. Patients in the higher dose group (14 mg) also had a lower likelihood of disability progression, but this difference was not statistically significant in the lower dose group (7 mg) as compared to placebo (O'Connor et al, 2011). Teriflunomide has boxed warnings for the possibility of severe liver injury and teratogenicity. The most common adverse reactions include increases in ALT, alopecia, diarrhea, influenza, nausea, and paresthesia. Mavenclad (cladribine) is a purine antimetabolite indicated for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS, to include relapsing -remitt ing disease and active secondary progressive disease. In a trial comparing Mavenclad to placebo, both Mavenclad 3.5 mg/kg and 5.25 mg/kg treatment groups had reduced ARRs and disability progression vs placebo (Giovannoni et al 2010). Mavenclad carries a boxed warning for risk of malignancies and teratogenicity. Lymphopenia is the most common adverse effect. Tysabri (natalizumab) is a recombinant monoclonal antibody indicated for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS and is also approved for use in the treatment of moderately to severely active CD in patients with an inadequate response to or who are unable to tolerate conventional CD therapies and TNF inhibitors. o In a 2011 systematic review of trials evaluating natalizumab for RRMS, pooled efficacy data from 2 RCTs (AFFIRM and SENTINEL) showed that natalizumab significantly reduced the risk for having a relapse during 2 years of treatment. In addition, natalizumab significantly reduced the risk for experiencing 12-week CDP at ). Natalizumab has been associated with an increased risk of PML; however , the overall incidence of PML has remained low (0.4%). Natalizumab can only be obtained through a restricted distribution program. Lemtrada (alemtuzumab) is a highly efficacious DMT that has demonstrated superiority in reducing relapses when compared to Rebif in both treatment -na\u00efve and treatment -experienced patients. The dosing schedule of 2 annual treatment courses is counterbalanced by the need for regular monitoring of the increased risk for autoimmunity. Lemtrada is best reserved for patients who have failed at least 2 other DMTs and are not candidates for natalizumab (Garnock -Jones 2014). Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) is a recombinant monoclonal antibody designed to selectively target CD20 -positive B cells. As a humanized form of Rituxan (rituximab), ocrelizumab is expected to be less immunogenic with repeated infusions and may have a more favorable benefit -to-risk profile than Rituxan (Sorensen et al 2016). 138 Data as of May 22, 2020 JE-U/JA-U/KMR Page 33 of 37 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. o Ocrevus provides another DMT option to the growing armamentarium of highly effective agents indicated for the treatment of relapsing MS. Ocrelizumab is also indicated for the treatment of PPMS, making it the first DMT with substantial evidence supporting its use in this form of MS. Although the pivotal studies of ocrelizumab were of sufficient length to assess efficacy, more long- term safety data are needed to evaluate the effects of ocrelizumab on emergent neoplasms and the risk of PML. Mitoxantrone is a synthetic intercalating chemotherapeutic agent. While it is approved for the treatment of RRMS, SPMS, and PRMS, cumulative dose- related cardiac toxicity and the risk for secondary leukemia markedly limit its use. Mitoxantrone is reserved for use in patients with aggressive disease. While DMTs do not sufficiently address QOL in RRMS, symptomatic agents such as Ampyra (dalfampridine) can be used to complement treatment with DMTs . Although a 25% improvement in T25FW may appear marginal, it has been established that improvements in T25FW speed of 20% are meaningful to people with MS. Dalfampridine can complement DMTs, which do not address the specific symptom of walking speed. Improved walking could potentially contain some of the direct and indirect costs (eg, reduced productivity, disability, unemployment, costs of assistive devices and caregivers) associated with MS. With an increasing number of DMTs currently on the market and no specific MS algorithm in place to guide treatment decisions , the selection of an agent is generally based on considerations of the risks and benefits of each therapy, physician experience, patient comorbidities, and patient preferences. o Clinicians should consider prescribing a high efficacy medication such as alemtuzumab, cladribine, fingolimod, ocrelizumab or natalizumab for newly -diagnosed individuals with highly active MS (MS Coalition 2019). o Clinicians should also consider prescribing a high efficacy medication for patients who have breakthrough activity on another DMT, regardless of the number of previously used agents ( MS Coalition 2019 ).

Therapeutic Class Overview Anticonvulsants INTRODUCTION Epilepsy is a disease of the brain defined by any of the following ( Fisher et al 2014): At least 2 unprovoked (or reflex) seizures occurring > 24 hours apart; 1 unprovoked (or reflex) seizure and a probability of further seizures similar to the general recurrence risk (at least 60%) after 2 unprovoked seizures, occurring over the next 10 years; Diagnosis of an epilepsy syndrome. Types of seizures include generalized seizures , focal ( partial ) seizures , and status epilepticus (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC ] 2018 , Epilepsy Foundation Greater Chicago 2020). Generalized seizures affect both sides of the brain and include: Tonic -clonic (grand mal) : begin with stiffening of the limbs, followed by jerking of the limbs and face Myoclonic: characterized by rapid, brief contractions of body muscles, usually on both sides of the body at the same time Atonic: characterized by abrupt loss of muscle tone; they are also called drop attacks or akinetic seizures and can result in injury due to falls Absence (petit mal) : characterized by brief lapses of awareness, sometimes with staring, that begin and end abruptly; they are more common in children than adults and may be accompanied by brief myoclonic jerking of the eyelids or facial muscles, a loss of muscle tone, or automatisms. Focal seizures are located in just 1 area of the brain and include: Simple : affect a small part of the brain; can affect movement, sensations, and emotion, without a loss of consciousness Complex : affect a larger area of the brain than simple focal seizures and the patient loses awareness ; episodes typically be gin with a blank stare, followed by chewing movements, picking at or fumbling with clothing, mumbling, and performing repeated unorganized movements or wandering; they may also be called epilepsy\" or \"psychomotor epilepsy\" Secondar ily generalized seizures: begin in 1 part of the brain and spread to both sides Status epilepticus is characterized by prolonged, uninterrupted seizure activity . Seizure classifications from the International League against Epilepsy (ILAE) were updated in 2017. The ILAE classification of seizure types is based on whether the seizure has a focal, generalized, or unknown onset; has a motoror non -motor onset; and whether the patient is aware or has impaired awareness during the event (for focal seizures). Additional classification details may also be used (Fisher et al 2017A, Fisher et al 2017B ). There is variation between the ILAE classifications and many of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)- approved indications for antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). For example, a \"focal aware\" seizure corresponds to the prior term \"simple partial seizure,\" and a \"focal impaired awareness\" seizure corresponds to the prior term \"complex partial seizure.\" A number of epilepsy syndromes have also been described; these are defined by groups of features that tend to occur together such as having a similar seizure type, age of onset, part of the brain involved, and electroencephalogram (EEG) pattern (Epilepsy Foundation 2013). An example is a childhood epilepsy syndrome called Lennox -Gastaut syndrome (LGS), which is characterized by several seizure types including tonic (stiffening) and atonic (drop) seizures. In LGS, there is a classic EEG pattern seen and intellectual development is usually impaired ( Epilepsy Foundation 2020 ). Epilepsy management is focused on the goals of 1) controlling seizures, 2) avoiding treatment -related adverse effects (AEs), and 3) maintaining or restoring quality of life. Management options vary based on the seizure type. It is usually appropriate to refer patients to a neurologist to establish the epilepsy diagnosis and formulate the management strategy(Schachter 2019). A correct diagnosis is essential to proper treatment selection. For example, absence seizures are commonl y confused with complex partial seizures. However, drugs that reduce absence seizures are generally ineffective for complex partial seizures, and the most effective drugs for complex partial seizures may be ineffective against or even increase the frequency of absence seizures (Epilepsy Foundation Greater Chicago 2020). 144 Data as of August 4, 2020 KM-U/KS-U/AKS Page 2 of 28 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Patients should always seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health provider with any questions regarding a medical condition. Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. When possible, monotherapy with a single AED is the preferred treatment approach. Combination therapy may be associated with decreased patient adherence to therapy and an increased incidence of AEs and drug interactions. When combination therapy is needed, it is recommended to select products with different mechanisms of action and AE profiles. There is little comparative clinical data to support the use of specific combinations ( Schachter 2019). Several broad classes of AEDs are available, including barbiturates, benzodiazepines, hydantoins, and miscellaneous agents (see Table 1). Cannabidiol (Epidiolex) was FDA- approved in June 2018 for use in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older with LGS or Dravet syndrome (FDA news release 2018). It was the first FDA -approved drug for treatment of patients with Dravet syndrome and the first approved drug that contains a purified substance, cannabidiol, derived from marijuana. In July 2020, cannabidiol was FDA -approved for the treatment of seizures associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) in pediatric patients 1 year of age and older ( Epidiolex prescribing information 2020, FDA news release 2020 ). The age range for the indications of treatment of seizures associated with LGS or Dravet syndrome was also expanded to include pediatric patients 1 year of age and older (Epidiolex prescribing information 2020) . Initially designated as a schedule V controlled substance, cannabidiol has been descheduled and is no longer classified as a controlled substance. Stiripentol (Diacomit) capsules and powder for oral suspension were FDA -approved in August 2018 for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome in patients 2 years of age and older taking clobazam. In June 2020, fenfluramine oral solution (Fintepla) was approved for the same indication without the requirement for concomitant clobazam ( Fintepla prescribing information 2020). Everolimus tablets for oral suspension (Afinitor Disperz) received an expanded indication in April 2018 for use in partial - onset seizures associated with TSC . This product is a kinase inhibitor that also has several oncology indications. Midazolam nasal spray (Nayzilam) was approved in May 2019 for the acute treatment of intermittent, stereotypic episodes of frequent seizure activity that are distinct from a patient's usual seizure pattern in patients with epilepsy 12 years of age ( Nayzilam prescribing information 2019). In January 2020, diazepam nasal spray (Valtoco) was approved for the same indication in patients as young as 6 years of age (Valtoco prescribing information 2020 ). Several of the AEDs are used for addi tional indications beyond the management of epilepsy, including (but not limited to) bipolar disorder, migraine prophylaxis, and several types of neuropathic pain. These additional indications are listed in Table 2; however, this review primarily focuses o n the use of AEDs for the management of epilepsy. Additionally, brands and formulations FDA-approved and marketed only for non -epilepsy indications are not included within this review; these include gabapentin tablets (Gralise ), extended -release management of postherpetic neuralgia and treatment of moderate -to-severe restless leg syndrome, and pregabalin extended- release tablets (Lyrica CR), FDA - approved only for the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral hypnotic s Table 1.

CLINICAL EFFICACY SUMMARY Overall, the anticonvulsants have demonstrated efficacy for their FDA -approved uses. Clinical trial data demonstrating efficacy of the anticonvulsants for the treatment of epilepsy is described in the prescribing information for the individual products, particularly for anticonvulsants more recently approved by the FDA. However, the prescribing information for some older, conventional proved products (eg, phenobarbital) do not contain efficacy data in their prescribing information. No single AED is clearly the most effective. Comparative efficacy data for the management of epilepsy are limited, and trials have generally not shown significant differences among drugs in terms of efficacy. However, the quality of the data is limited and generally derived from short -term trials ( Karceski 201 9). When possible, monotherapy with a single AED is the preferred treatment approach. Combination therapy may be associated with decreased patient adherence to therapy and an increased incidence of AEs and drug interactions. (Schachter 2019). Most patients with epilepsy are treated with anticonvulsant monotherapy ( Nevitt et al 2017). An evidence review summarized AED efficacy and effectiveness as initial monotherapy for epileptic seizures and syndromes ( Glauser et al 2013 ). This publication provides conclusions based on a review of 64 randomized trials and 11 meta -analyses. Conclusions include the following: As initial monotherapy for adults with newly diagnosed or untreated partial -onset seizures: Carbamazepine, levetiracetam, phenytoin, are potentially efficacious/effective. As initial monotherapy for children with newly diagnosed or untreated partial -onset are potentially efficacious/effective. As initial monotherapy for elderly adults with newly diagnosed or untreated partial -onset seizures: Gabapentin and lamotrigine are efficacious/effective. Topiramate and valproate are potentially efficacious/effective. 152 Data as of August 4, 2020 KM-U/KS-U/AKS Page 10 of 28 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. As initial monotherapy for adults with newly diagnosed or untreated precipitate or aggravate generalized -onset tonic -clonic seizures. For children with newly diagnosed or generalized tonic -clonic seizures: aggravate generalized -onset tonic -clonic seizures. As initial monotherapy for children with newly diagnosed or untreated absence seizures: Ethosuximide and valproate are established as efficacious/effective. vigabatrin may precipitate or aggravate absence seizures (based on scattered reports). As initial monotherapy for children with benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes Carbamazepine oxcarbazepine, and sulthiame (not available in the United States) are potentially efficacious/effective. For patients with newly diagnosed JME: absence, myoclonic, and in some cases generalized tonic -clonic seizures. There has also been a report that lamotrigine may exacerbate seizures in JME. There is a lack of well -designed randomized trials in epilepsy, particularly for generalized seizures and in the pediatric population. A Cochrane systematic review evaluated the efficacy of AED monotherapy for epilepsy ( Nevitt et al 2017). The treatment of partial -onset seizures (simple partial, complex partial or secondarily generalized) or generalized tonic -clonic seizures with or without other generalized seizure types. This network meta- analysis showed that for the primary outcome, the time to withdrawal of allocated treatment: For individuals with partial seizures , levetiracetam performed better than carbamazepine and lamotrigine; lamotrigine performed better than all other treatments (aside from levetiracetam); and c arbamazepine performed better than gabapentin and phenobarbital. For individuals with generalized onset seizures, valproate performed better than carbamazepine, topiramate and phenobarbital. For both partial and generalized onset seizures, phenobarbital seems to perform worse than all other treatments. For the secondary outcome, time to first seizure: For individuals with partial seizures , phenobarbital performed better than both carbamazepine and lamotrigine; better than valproate, gabapentin, and lamotrigine; and phenytoin performed better than lamotrigine. For both partial and generalized seizure types, phenytoin and phenobarbital generally perfor med better than other t reatments . Few notable differences were shown for either partial or generalized seizure types for the secondary outcomes of time to 6 -month or 12- month remission of seizures. Overall, direct evidence and network meta- analysis estimates were numerically similar, and effect sizes had overlapping confidence intervals. Data for individuals with generalized seizures are still limited and additional randomized trials are needed. The relative efficacy for generalized (n = 7 studies) or absence seizures (n = 3 studies) was evaluated in a systematic r eview and network meta -analysis (Campos et al 2018) . The outcomes analyzed were seizure freedom and withdrawal due to inefficacy. Compared to valproate, phenytoin had a lower odds of seizure freedom (odds ratio, 0.50; 153 Data as of August 4, 2020 KM-U/KS-U/AKS Page 11 of 28 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Lamotrigine had the highest probability of seizure freedom and valproate had the highest probability of withdrawal due to inefficacy in these patients . For absence seizures, ethosuximide and valproate were found to have a higher probability of seizure freedom compared to lamotrigine. A meta -analysis estimated the comparative efficacy of achieving seizure freedom with 22 antiepileptic drugs and placebo in children and adolescents (Rosati et al 2018) . For the treatment of newly diagnosed focal epilepsy (n = 4 studies), point estimates suggested superiority of carbamazepine and lamotrigine; however, this was not statistically significant. For refractory focal epilepsy (n = 9 studies), levetiracetam and perampanel were more effective than placebo in mixed comparisons. Ethosuximide and valproic acid were more effective than lamotrigine for absence seizures. The authors concluded that better designed comparative studies with appropriate length of follow -up, well -defined outcomes, and reliable inclusion criteria are needed to validate these results. A meta -analysis compared monotherapy with carbamazepine or phenytoin in children and adults with focal onset seizures (simple or complex focal and secondarily generalized ), or generalized onset tonic -clonic seizures (with or without other generalized seizure types). Results demonstrated that the time to treatment failure (primary outcome) did not significantly differ between treatment groups. The time to first seizure after randomization and 6- month and 12- month remission were also similar between groups ( Nevitt et al 2019). Approximately 20 % to 40% of patients with epilepsy can be considered refractory to drug treatment, referred to as drug- resistant epilepsy. Treatment of drug -resistant epilepsy may include additional anticonvulsant drug trials, epilepsy surgery, vagal nerve stimulation, and dietary changes (the ketogenic diet) ( Sirven 2018 ). Combination AED regimens are an option for the treatment of drug -resistant epilepsy. However, robust clinical evidence of suitable combinations of AEDs has been difficult to generate due to the large number of possible combinations of drugs and doses. Examples of combinations for which there is some evidence of efficacy include valproate plus lamotrigine for partial -onset and generalized seizures, valproate plus ethosuximide for absence seizures, and lamotrigine plus topiramate for various seizure types; however, even this evidence is fairly limited. In general, when considering combination therapy, it is recommended to combine medications with different mechanisms of action, and to be mindful of the overall drug load to minimize AEs. Two -drug therapy should be attempted before considering addition of a third drug, and higher numbers of drugs should be avoided as they are asso ciated with a very low likelihood of additional seizure reduction ( Kwan et al 2011). A meta -analysis examined the efficacy of newer AEDs (eslicarbazepine, brivaracetam, perampanel, and lacosamide) vs levetiracetam as adjunct ive therapy for uncontrolled partial -onset seizures. Most patients in this meta- analysis were on at least 2 other AEDs at the time of treatment. In this analysis, eslicarbazepine, lacosamide, and brivaracetam were non -inferior to levetiracetam in terms of efficacy, but all newer AEDs except brivaracetam had worse tolerability profiles than levetiracetam at high doses ( Zhu et al 2017). A network meta -analysis examined refractory partial -onset seizures while using monotherapy ( Zhao et al 2017). The efficacy outcomes studied were 50% responder rate and state of seizure freedom. The authors concluded that topiramate, levetiracetam, pregabalin, and oxcarbazepine were preferable for their relatively high efficacy and low risk of AEs. Rufinamide was the least preferable medication due to its low efficacy and high risk of AEs. A network meta- analysis was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of 17 newer AEDs for treatment of refractory partial - onset epilepsy with or without secondary generalization ( Hu et al 2018) . The primary outcome was seizure freedom, which was defined as a 100% seizure reduction in the maintenance or double- blind treatment period of the trial. Safety was assessed by the withdrawal rate due to treatment -emergent AEs. Based on results of 54 studies that evaluated the efficacy outcome, the most effective agents included tiagabine, brivaracetam, and valproic acid, and the least effective agents included rufinamide, lamotrigine, and zonisamide. Products with favorable safety included levetiracetam, brivaracetam, and perampanel, while those with the least favorable safety included retigabine (not available in the United States), oxcarbazepine, and rufinamide. The authors stated that agents with the best outcomes in term s of efficacy and safety include d levet iracetam, vigabatrin, valproic acid, and brivaracetam. Cann abidiol (Epidiolex) was approved in June 2018 for use in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older with LGS or Dravet syndrome ( FDA news release 2018). It is the first FDA- approved drug for treatment of patients with Dravet syndrome and is the first approved drug that contains a purified substance, cannabidiol, derived from marijuana. Its approval for these 2 indications was based on 3 placebo- controlled trials in patients refractory to other treatments. 154 Data as of August 4, 2020 KM-U/KS-U/AKS Page 12 of 28 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Cannabidiol , along with use of other agents , demonstrated a significant reduction in seizure frequency compared to placebo ( Thiele et al 2018; Devinsky et al 2018; Devinsky al 2017). In July 2020, cannabidiol was FDA -approved for a third indication, treatment of seizures associated with TSC, and the age range for all 3 indications was aligned to include pediatric patients 1 year of age and ol der (FDA news release 2020, Epidiolex prescribing information 2020 ). In a placebo -controlled trial of 224 patients with TSC and seizures inadequately controlled with 1 concomitant AED, cannabidiol resulted in a significant reduction in seizure frequency compared to placebo ( Epidiolex prescribing information 2020). To date, no comparative trials have been published. Everolimus tablets for oral suspension (Afinitor Disperz) received an expanded indication for adjunctive use in TSC - associated partial -onset seizures in April 2018. Results of a randomized, double-blind, place bo-controlled study of 366 patients with inadequately controlled seizures on 2 or more AEDs demonstrated a significant reduction in seizure frequency compared to placebo ( French et al 2016). In August 2018, the FDA approv ed a second drug, stiripentol (Diac omit), for use in the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome. Two multicenter placebo- controlled studies evaluated the addition of stiripentol to clobazam and valproate therapy in patients 3 years to less than 18 years of age with Dravet syndrome. Responder rates (seizure frequency reduced by 50%) with respect to generalized tonic- clonic seizures were significantly lower with stiripentol compared to placebo ( Diacomit prescribing information 2018) . In May 2019, a nasal spray formulation of midazolam (Nayzilam) was approved for the acute treatment of cluster seizures in adults and adolescents. In one randomized controlled trial in patients with seizure clusters while receiving a stable AED regimen, the proportion of patients who experienced treatment success (seizure termination within 10 minutes and no recurrence for the next 6 hours) was significantly higher with midazolam nasal spray compared to placebo (53.7% vs 34.4%, p = 0.0109) with similar tolerability ( Detyniecki et al 2019). Cenobamate was approved in late 2019 and its efficacy has yet to be compared to other AEDs. The approval of this agent was based on 2 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled studies that enrolled 655 adults with partial -onset seizures with or without generalization who were not adequately controlled with 1 to 3 other AEDs. The results of these trials demonstrated that cenobamate significantly reduced the frequency of seizures occurring in a 28 - day period. In the first trial, the median percent change in seizure frequency from baseline was -55.6% with cenobamate and -21.5% with placebo. In the second trial, the median percent change ranged from -36.3% to - 55.3% with cenobamate and was -24.3% with placebo (Xcopri package insert 2019, Krauss et al 2020). In June 2020, the FDA approved a third drug, fenfluramine (Fintepla), for use in the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome. Two randomized, double- blind, placebo- controlled studies evaluated fenfluramine in patients 2 to 18 years of age with Dravet syndrome who were in adequately controlled with 1 to 4 other AEDs. In both trials, fenfluramine significantly reduced the frequency of convulsive seizures occurring in a 28- day period as compared to placebo. In the first trial , in patients not receiving stiripentol , fenfluramine at a dose of 0.7 mg/kg/day demonstrated a 62.3% greater reduction in mean monthly convulsive seizure frequency (MCSF) over 14 weeks compared with placebo. In the second trial , in patients who were receiving a stiripentol -inclusive AED regimen , fenfluramine at a dose of 0.4 mg/kg/day showed a 54% greater reduction in MCSF over 15 weeks compared with placebo ( Fintepla package insert 2020, Lagae et al 2020, Nabbout et al 2019). A 2019 randomized controlled trial of children and adults with benzodiazepine -refractory convulsive status epilepticus compared the efficacy of intravenous levetiracetam (n = 145 patients), fosphenytoin (n = 118), or valproate (n = 121) in this setting. Results demonstrated that each agent led to seizure cessation and improved alertness by 1 hour in approximately 50% of patients, with no significant differences between groups ( Kapur et al 2019). A meta -analysis of 9 randomized controlled trials evaluated the efficacy and safety of levetiracetam vs phenytoin as second -line treatment for benzodiazepine- resistant status epilepticus in children and adults. The efficacy outcomes included seizure cessation and seizure recurrence within 24 hours. The authors did not find a significant difference in efficacy between levetiracetam and phenytoin in the overall population or in the subgroup analysis of pediatric patients. AEs were similar across both groups except for a higher incidence of cardiac instability, reported mainly as hypotension, in the phenytoin group (DeMott et al 2020). CLINICAL GUIDELINES Efficacy and tolerability of the new antiepileptic drugs I: treatment of new -onset epilepsy. American Academy of Neurology and American Epilepsy Society ( French et al 2004A, Kanner et al, 2018A ). A 2018 update to the 2004 guideline focuses on treatment of new -onset epilepsy with second and third generation AEDs. The 2004 publication summarizes the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of gabapentin, lamotrigine, topiramate, 155 Data as of August 4, 2020 KM-U/KS-U/AKS Page 13 of 28 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. tiagabine, oxcarbazepine, levetiracetam, and zonisamide for the treatment of children and adults with newly diagnosed partial and generalized epilepsies. The r ecommendations from the 2004 guideline include the following: Patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy who require treatment can be initially treated with standard AEDs such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, valproic acid, lamotrigine, gabapentin, oxcarbazepine, or topiramate. Choice will depend on individual patient characteristics. Lamotrigine can be included in the options for children with newly diagnosed absence seizures. The 2018 recommendations include the following: As monotherapy in adult patients with new- onset focal epilepsy or unclassified generalized tonic -clonic seizures: Lamotrigine use should be considered to decrease seizure frequency. Lamotrigine use should be considered and gabapentin use may be considered to decrease seizure frequency in patients aged 60 years. Levetiracetam and zonisamide use may be considered to decrease seizure frequency. Vigabatrin appears to be less efficacious than carbamazepine immediate -release and may not be offered; furthermore, the toxicity profile precludes vigabatrin use as fi rst-line therapy . Pregabalin 150 mg per day is possibly less efficacious than lamotrigine 100 mg per day . There is insufficient evidence to consider use of gabapentin, oxcarbazepine, or topiramate over carbamazepine. There is insufficient evidence to consider use of topiramate instead of phenytoin in urgent treatment of new - onset or recurrent focal epilepsy, unclassified generalized tonic -clonic seizures, or generalized epilepsy presenting with generalized tonic -clonic seizures. Data are lacking to s upport or refute new-onset epilepsy. Data are lacking to support or refute use of newer AEDs in treating unclassified generalized tonic -clonic seizures. Ethosuximide or valproic acid should be considered before lamotrigine to decrease seizure frequency in children with absence epilepsy. An exception would be if there are compelling AE -related concerns with use of ethosuximide or valproic acid. The guideline does not address newly approved agents including cannabidiol, everolimus, or stiripentol. Efficacy and tolerability of the new antiepileptic drugs II: treatment of refractory epilepsy . American Academy of Neurology and American Epilepsy Society ( Kanner et al 2018B , French et al 2004B ). A 2018 update to the 2004 guideline focuses on management of treatment -resistant epilepsy with second and third generation AEDs . The 2004 publication s ummarizes the oxcarbazepine, levetiracetam, and zonisamide for the treatment of children and adults with refractory partial and generalized epilepsies. Recommendations from the 2004 guideline include the following: It is appropriate to use gabapentin, levetiracetam, with refractory epilepsy. Oxcarbazepine, topiramate, and lamotrigine can be used as monotherapy in patients with refractory partial epilepsy. Topiramate may be used for the treatment of refractory generalized tonic -clonic seizures in adults and children. Gabapentin, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, and topiramate may be used as adjunctive treatment of children with refractory partial seizures . Topiramate and lamotrigine may be used to treat drop attacks associated with LGS in adults and children. Recommendations from the 2018 guideline include the following: As adjunctive therapy in patients with treatment -resistant adult focal epilepsy (TRAFE): Immediate -release pregabalin and perampanel are established as effective to reduce seizure frequency. Lacosamide, eslicarbazepine, and extended- release topiramate should be considered to decrease seizure frequency. Vigabat rin and rufinamide are effective for decreasing seizure frequency, but are not first-line agents . 156 Data as of August 4, 2020 KM-U/KS-U/AKS Page 14 of 28 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Ezogabine (no longer marketed) use should be considered to reduce seizure frequency, but carries a serious risk of skin and retinal discolorat ion. Clobazam and extended -release oxcarbazepine may be considered to decrease seizure frequency. As monotherapy in patients with TRAFE: Eslicarbazepine use may be considered to decrease seizure frequency. Data are insufficient to recommend use of second - and the other third- generation AEDs. For add- on therapy for generalized epilepsy, immediate- release and extended -release lamotrigine should be considered as add -on therapy to decrease seizure frequency in adults with treatment -resistant generalized tonic -clonic seizures secondary to generalized epilepsy. Levetiracetam use should be considered to decrease seizure frequency as add -on therapy for treatment -resistant generalized tonic -clonic seizures and for treatment -resistant juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Rufinamide is effective to reduce seizure frequency as add -on therapy for LGS . Clobazam use should be considered as add -on therapy for LGS . For add- on therapy in pediatric patients with treatment -resistant focal epilepsy: Levetiracetam use should be considered to decrease seizure frequency (ages 1 month to 16 years). Zonisamide use should be considered to decrease seizure frequency (age 6 to 17 years). Oxcarbazepine use should be considered to decrease seizure frequency (age 1 month to 4 years). Data are unavailable on the efficacy of clobazam, eslicarbazepine, lacosamide, perampanel, rufinamide, tiagabine, or vigabatrin.

Guideline Development Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Epilepsy Society ( Krumholz et al 2015; reaffirmed in 2018 ). This practice guideline makes recommendations based on a consideration of the evidence for prognosis and treatment of adults with an unprovoked first seizure. Recommendations include the following: Adults presenting with an unprovoked first seizure should be informed that the chance for a recurrent seizure is greatest within the first 2 years after a first seizure (21% to 45%). Clinicians should also advise such patients that clinical factors associated with an increased risk of seizure recurrence include a prior brain insult such as a stroke or trauma, an EEG with epileptiform abnormalities, a significant brain- imaging abnormality, or a nocturnal seizure. Clinicians should advise patients that, although immediate AED therapy, as compared with delay of treatment pending a second seizure, is likely to reduce the risk of a seizure recurrence in the 2 years subsequent to a first seizure, it may not improve quality of life. Clinicians should advise patients that over the longer term (> 3 years), immediate AED treatment is unli kely to improve the prognosis for sustained seizure remission. Patients should be advised that their risk for AED AEs ranges from 7% to 31% and that these AEs are predominantly mild and reversible. Immediate AED therapy after an unprovoked first seizure is likely to reduce seizure recurrence risk. A reduction in risk may be important, particularly for adults, for whom seizure recurrences may cause serious psychological and social consequences such as loss of driving privileges and limitations on employment. However, immediate AED treatment is not well accepted and is debated. Decisions should be based on weighing the risk of recurrence against the AEs of AED therapy, and should take patient preferences into account. It is accepted that when a patient has a second or additional seizures, an AED should be initiated because the risk of subsequent seizures is very high. Evidence -based guideline: treatment of convulsive status epilepticus in children and adults. Guideline Committee of the American Epilepsy Society (Glauser et al 2016 ). This publication provides conclusions and a treatment algorithm based on a structured literature review of randomized trials of anticonvulsant treatments for seizures lasting longer than 5 minutes. A total of 38 trials were included. For treatment in the adult population, conclusions included the following: Intramuscular (IM) midazolam, intravenous (IV) lorazepam, IV diazepam (with or without phenytoin), and IV phenobarbital are established as efficacious at stopping seizures lasting at least 5 minutes. IV lorazepam is more effective than IV phenytoin in stopping seizures lasting at least 10 minutes. 157 Data as of August 4, 2020 KM-U/KS-U/AKS Page 15 of 28 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Patients should always seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health provider with any questions regarding a medical condition. Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. There is no difference in efficacy between IV lorazepam followed by IV phenytoin, IV diazepam plus phenytoin followed by IV lorazepam, and IV phenobarbital followed by IV phenytoin. IV valproic acid has similar efficacy to IV phenytoin or continuous IV diazepam as second therapy after failure of a benzodiazepine. Insufficient data exist in adults about the efficacy of levetiracetam as either initial or second therapy. In adults with status epilepticus without established IV access, IM midazolam is established as more effective compared with IV lorazepam. No significant difference in effectiveness has been demonstrated between lorazepam and diazepam in adults with status epilepticus. For treatment in the pediatric population, conclusions included the following: IV lorazepam and IV diazepam are established as efficacious at stopping seizures lasting at least 5 minutes. Rectal diazepam, IM mida zolam, intranasal midazolam, and buccal midazolam are probably effective at stopping seizures lasting at least 5 minutes. Insufficient data exist in children about the efficacy of intranasal lorazepam, as initial therapy. IV valproic acid has similar efficacy but better tolerability than IV phenobarbital as second therapy after failure of a benzodiazepine. Insufficient data exist in children regarding the efficacy of phenytoin or levetiracetam as second therapy after failure of a benzodiazepine. In children with status epilepticus, no significant difference in effectiveness has been established between IV lorazepam and IV diazepam. In children with status epilepticus, non- IV midazolam (IM/intranasal/buccal) is probably more effective than diazepam (IV/rectal). Conclusions included the following (age not specified): Insufficient data exist about the comparative efficacy of phenytoin and fosphenytoin. Fosphenytoin is better tolerated compared with phenytoin. When both are available, fosphenytoin is preferred based on tolerability, but phenytoin is an acceptable alternative. The overall treatment algorithm directs that: A benzodiazepine (IM midazolam, IV lorazepam, or IV diazepam) is recommended as the initial therapy of choice in the first phase of treatment (5 to 20 minutes after the beginning of the seizure). Although IV phenobarbital is established as efficacious and well tolerated as initial therapy, its slower rate of administration positions it as an alternative initial therapy. For prehospital settings or where first -line benzodiazepine options are not available, rectal diazepam, intranasal midazolam, and buccal midazolam are reasonable initial therapy alternatives. In the second phase of treatment (from 20 to 40 minutes after the beginning of the seizure), reasonable options include fosphenytoin, valproic acid, and levetiracetam. There is no clear evidence that any of these options is better than the others. Because of AEs, IV phenobarbital is a reasonable second -therapy alternative if none of the 3 recommended therapies are available. There is no clear evidence to guide therapy in the third phase of therapy ( 40 minutes after the beginning of the seizure) . Evidence -based guideline update: medical treatment of infantile spasms. Guideline Development Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the Practice Committee of the Child Neurology Society ( Go et al 2012; reaffirmed in 2018) This publication provides updated recommendations for the treatment of infantile spasm s. The literature review included an evaluation of 26 published articles on this topic. Recommendations include the following: Evidence is insufficient to recommend the use of prednisolone, dexamethasone, and methylprednisolone as being as effective as adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) for short -term treatment of infantile spasm s. Low-dose ACTH should be considered as an alternative to high -dose ACTH for treatment of infantile spasms. ACTH or vigabatrin may be offered for short -term treatment of infantile spasms; evidence suggests that ACTH may be offered over vigabatrin. 158 Data as of August 4, 2020 KM-U/KS-U/AKS Page 16 of 28 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Patients should always seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health provider with any questions regarding a medical condition. Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. Evidence is insufficient to recommend other therapies (valproic acid, vitamin B6, nitrazepam [not ketogenic diet, or novel/combination therapies ) for treatment of infantile spasms. Hormonal therapy (ACTH or prednisolone) may be considered for use in preference to vigabatrin in infants with cryptogenic infantile spasms, to possibly improve developmental outcome. A shorter lag time to treatment of infantile spasms with either hormonal therapy or vigabatrin may be considered to improve long -term cognitive outcomes. There is a lack of sufficient randomized trials to provide definitive answers to key questions related to treatment of infantile spas ms. Practice parameter: treatment of the child with a first unprovoked seizure. Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the Practice Committee of the Child Neurology Society ( Hirtz et al 2003; reaffirmed in 2018 ) This parameter reviews published literature relevant to the decision to begin treatment after a child or adolescent experiences a first unprovoked seizure and presents evidence- based practice recommendations. Treatment during the neonatal period is not addressed. Recommendations include the following: Treatment with AEDs is not indicated for the prevention of the development of epilepsy. Treatment with AEDs may be considered in circumstances where the benefits of reducing the risk of a second seizure outweigh the risks of pharmacologic and psychosocial AEs. The majority of children who experience a first unprovoked seizure will have few or no recurrences. Treatment with AEDs after a first seizure as opposed to after a second seizure has not been shown to improve prognosis for long - term seizure remission. Treatment has been shown in several studies combining both children and adults to reduce the risk of s eizure recurrence; however, there is a relative paucity of data from studies involving only children after a first seizure. Summary of recommendations for the management of infantile seizures . Task force report for the ILAE Commission of Pediatrics ( Wilmshurst et al 2015). This publication recommends an approach to the standard and optimal management of infants with seizures. When possible, recommendations are evidence- based; however, when no evidence was available, recommendations are based on expert opinion and standard practice. Recommendations/findings include the following: There is no indication for initiation of chronic AEDs for simple febrile seizures. However, in the acute treatment of febrile seizures, it is important to treat seizures lasting 10 minutes or longer. In an otherwise healthy infant, a policy of \"wait and see\" is reasonable after the first afebrile seizure. However, this is a rare event and close monitoring is essential. Treatment options with established or probable efficacy include the following: Focal seizures: levetiracetam stiripentol or situational seizures: carbamazepine There is no clear evidence supporting an optimal duration of treatment; this is dependent on seizure type. Guidelines on neonatal seizures . World Health Organization (WHO) (WHO 2011). This d ocument was prepared based on a systematic review of the literature and involved cooperation between the WHO, the ILAE, and the International Bureau of Epilepsy (IBE). Recommendations include the following: Phenobarbital should be used as the first -line ag ent for treatment of neonatal seizure s and should be made readily available in all settings. 159 Data as of August 4, 2020 KM-U/KS-U/AKS Page 17 of 28 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. In neonates who continue to have seizures despite administering the maxim um tolerated dose of phenobarbital, either a benzodiazepine, phenytoin, or lidocaine may be used as the second-line agent for control of seizures (use of phenytoin or lidocaine requires cardiac monitoring). In neonates with a normal neurological examination and/or normal EEG, stopping AEDs may be considered if the neonate has been seizure -free for > 72 hours; the drug(s) should be reinstituted if seizures recur . In neonates in whom seizure control is achieved with a single AED, the drug can be discontinued abruptly without tapering the dose. In neonates requiring > 1 AED for seizure control, the drugs may be stopped one at a time , with phenobarbital being the last drug to be withdrawn. Practice parameter update: management issues for women with epilepsy - focus on pregnancy (an evidence - based review): teratogenesis and perinatal outcomes. Quality Standards Subcommittee and Therapeutics and Technology Assessment Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and American Epilepsy Society ( Harden et al 2009A ; reaffirmed in 2013; Update in progress ) This publication summarizes evidence for selected issues regarding the clinical management of women with epilepsy (WWE) who are pregnant or plan ning to be pregnant . Recommendations include the following: If possible, avoidance of the use of valproate as part of polytherapy during the first trimester of pregnancy should be considered to decrease the risk of major congenital malformations (MCMs). If possible, avoidance of the use of valproate monotherapy during the first trimester of pregnancy may be considered to decrease t he risk of MCMs. To reduce the risk of MCMs, the use of valproate during the first trimester of pregnancy should be avoided, if possible, compared to the use of carbamazepine. To reduce the risk of MCMs, avoidance of the use of polytherapy with valproate during the first trimester of pregnancy, if possible, should be considered, compared to polytherapy without valproate. To reduce the risk of MCMs, avoidance of the use of valproate during the first trimester of pregnancy, if possible, may be considered, compared to the use of phenytoin or lamotrigine. To reduce the risk of MCMs, avoidance of the use of AED polytherapy during the first trimester of pregnancy, if possible, compared to monotherapy should be considered. Limiting the dosage of valproate or lamotrigine during the first trimester, if possible, should be considered to lessen the risk of MCMs. Avoidance of the use of valproate, if possible, should be considered to reduce the risk of neural tube defects and facial clefts , and may be considered to reduce the risk of hypospadias. Avoidance of phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital, if possible, may be considered to reduce the risk of specific MCMs: cleft palate for phenytoin use, posterior cleft palate use, and cardiac malformations for phenobarbital use. Carbamazepine exposure probably does not produce cognitive impairment in offspring of WWE. Avoiding valproate in WWE during pregnancy, if possible, should be considered to reduce the risk of poor cognitive outcomes. Avoiding phenytoin and phenobarbital in WWE during pregnancy, if possible, may be considered to reduce the risk of poor cognitive outcomes. Monotherapy should be considered in place of polytherapy, if possible, for WWE who take AEDs during pregnancy to reduce the risk of poor cognitive outcomes. For WWE who are pregnant, avoidance of valproate, if possible, should be considered compared to carbamazepine to reduce the risk of poor cognitive outcomes. For WWE who are pregnant, avoidance of valproate, if possible, may be considered compared to phenytoin to reduce the risk of poor cognitive outcomes. Valproate has the most data showing an association with risk from in utero exposure. If a change from valproate to another AED is planned, it is prudent to make this change well before pregnancy. Although many of the recommendations in this parameter suggest minimizing AED exposure during pregnancy, for most WWE, discontinuing AEDs is not a reasonable or safe option. Discontinuing AEDs may expose the mother and fetus to physical injury from accidents due to seizure activity.

Therapeutics and Technology Assessment Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and American Epilepsy Society ( Harden et al 2009B ; reaffirmed in 2013; Update in progress ) This publication summarizes evidence for selected issues regarding the clinical management of WWE who are pregnant or planning to be pregnant . Recommendations include the following: placenta may be factored into the clinical decision regarding the necessity of AED treatment for a woman with epilepsy. Monitoring of lamotrigine, carbamazepine, and phenytoin levels during pregnancy should be considered. Monitoring of levetiracetam and oxcarbazepine (as monohydroxy derivative) levels during pregnancy may be considered. There is insufficient evidence to support or refute a change in phenobarbital, valproate, primidone, or ethosuximide levels related to pregnancy, but this lack of evidence should not discourage monitoring levels of these AEDs during pregnancy. Valproate, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and carbamazepine may not transfer into breast milk to as great an extent as primidone, levetiracetam, gabapentin, lamotrigine, and topiramate. Although many of the AEDs were shown to cross the placenta or enter breast milk, studies were limited in duration and did not systematically evaluate neonatal symptoms. Guidelines also support the use of AEDs for several common non- epilep sy indications: The American Academy of Neurology and American Headache Society state that AEDs with established efficacy for migraine prevention include valproate, divalproex sodium, and topiramate; carbamazepine to y effective ( Silbers tein et al 2012; reaffirmed in 2015; Update in progress ). An American Academy of Neurology guideline for pediatric migraine prevention noted that children and adolescents with migraine receiving topiramate are probably more likely than those receiving placebo to have a reduction in migraine or headache day frequency, whereas there was insufficient evidence to support the efficacy of extended -release divalproex sodium for reducing frequency (Oskoui et al 2019). The American Academy of Neurology, American Association of Neuromuscular and Electrodiagnostic Medicine, and American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation state that, for relief of painful diabetic neuropathy, pregabalin is established as effective, and gabapentin and valproate are probably effective ( Bril et al 2011; Update in progress ). A retired guideline from The American Academy of Neurology states that gabapentin and pregabalin are of benefit in reducing pain from postherpetic neuralgia ( Dubinsky et al 2004; retired February 27 , 2018 ). American Psychiatric Association guidelines describe the key role of AEDs in the management of bipolar disorder, including the following (Hirschfeld et al 2002 ): First-line pharmacological treatment for more severe manic or mixed episodes is either lithium plus an antipsychotic or valproate plus an antipsychotic; for less ill patients, monotherapy with lithium, valproate, or an antipsychotic may be sufficient. For mixed episodes, valproate may be preferred over lithium. Carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine are alternatives. First-line pharmacological treatment for bipolar depression is either lithium or lamotrigine. When an acute depressive episode of bipolar disorder does not respond to first -line medication treatment, the next steps include adding lamotrigine, bupropion, or paroxetine. The initial treatment for patients who experience rapid cycling should include lithium or valproate; an alternative is lamotrigine. The medications with the best empirical evidence to support their use in maintenance treatment include lithium and valproate; possible alternatives include lamotrigine, carbamazepine, or oxcarbazepine. Note: This guideline was published in 2002 and cannot be assumed to be current; however, AEDs continue to be recommended for both acute (mania or hypomania) and maintenance phases of bipolar disorder (Post 2017, Stovall 2018 ). SAFETY SUMMARY Tolerability and safety are as important as efficacy in determining the overall effectiveness of epilepsy treatment (Schachter 2019). 161 Data as of August 4, 2020 KM-U/KS-U/AKS Page 19 of 28 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

The Content is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Patients should always seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health provider with any questions regarding a medical condition. Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. Common AEs among AEDs include the following (Fintepla prescribing information 2020, Schachter 2019): anxiety , nervousness, insomnia aggression, irritability, hyperactivity depression, mood alteration confusion ataxia blurred or double vision Examples of r are but serious AEs include the following ( Schachter 2019, individual package inserts ): suicidal ideation and behavior (AED s as a cla and cardiac arrest (phenytoin) abnormal magnetic resonance imaging signals in infants (vigabatrin) intramyelinic edema (vigabatrin) serotonin syndrome (fenfluramine) significant including hypertensive crisis (fenfluramine) A number of AEDs carry boxed warnings related to potentially serious AEs; these include the following: Carbamazepine: Serious and sometimes fatal dermatologic reactions, including TEN and SJS, have been reported. Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA -B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA -B gene. Patients with ancestry in genetically at-risk populations (across broad areas of Asia) should be screened for the presence of HLA -B*1502 prior to initiating treatment with carbamazepine. Aplastic anemia and agranulocytosis have been reported. If a patient exhibits low or decreased white blood cell or platelet counts, the patient should be monitored closely, and discontinuation of the drug should be considered if any evidence of significant bone marrow depression develops. Clobazam, c lonazepam , clorazepate, diazepam , and midazolam : Concomitant use of benzodiazepine s and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Concomitant prescribing should be reserved for use in patients for whom alternative 162 Data as of August 4, 2020 KM-U/KS-U/AKS Page 20 of 28 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. treatment options are inadequate, and patients should be followed for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. Felbamate: Use is associated with a marked increase in the incidence of aplastic anemia. Felbamate should only be used in patients whose epilepsy is so severe that the risk of aplastic anemia is deemed acceptable. Routine blood testing cannot be reliably used to reduce the incidence of aplastic anemia, but it will in some cases allow detection of hematologic changes before the syndrome declares itself clinically. Felbamate should be discontinued if any evidence of bone marrow depression occurs. Cases of acute liver failure have been reported. Felbamate should not be prescribed for anyone with a history of hepatic dysfunction. Treatment should be initiated only in individuals without active liver disease and with norm al baseline serum transaminases. It has not been proven that periodic serum transaminase testing will prevent serious injury, but it is generally believed that early detection of drug -induced hepatic injury along with immediate withdrawal of the suspect drug enhances the likelihood for recovery. Serum transaminases should be monitored at baseline and periodically thereafter. Felbamate should be discontinued if either aspartate aminotransferase (AST ) or alanine aminotransferase ( ALT) become increased to 2 times the upper limit of normal, or if clinical signs and symptoms suggest liver failure, and should not be considered for retreatment. Fenfluramine: Use of serotonergic drugs with 5-HT2B receptor agonist activity (eg, f enfluramine) is associated with valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension. Echocardiogram assessments are required before, during, and after treatment with fenfluramine, and the benefits vs risks of initiating or continuing treatment with this product must be considered based on echocardiogram findings. Due to the risks of valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension, fenfluramine is available only through a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) program ( FDA REMS 2020 ). Healthcare providers who pres cribe fenfluramine and pharmacies that dispense the product must be certified. Each patient must be enrolled in the REMS program. Prescribers must ensure that periodic cardiovascular monitoring is performed and report any AE suggestive of valvular heart disease and/or pulmonary hypertension to the fenfluramine REMS program. Fosphenytoin and phenytoin: There is a cardiovascular risk associated with rapid IV infusion rates. The rate of administration should not exceed recommendations, and careful cardiac monitoring is required. Lamotrigine: Cases of life -threatening serious skin rashes, including SJS and TEN, and/or rash-related death have been caused by lamotrigine. Benign rashes are also caused by lamotrigine; however, it is not possible to predict which ras hes will prove to be serious. Lamotrigine should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug related. Perampanel: Serious or life -threatening psychiatric and behavioral AEs including aggression, hostility, irritability, anger, and homicidal ideation and threats have been reported. Patients should be monitored for these reactions and for changes in mood, behavior, or personality. The dose should be reduced if these symptoms occur, and it should be discontinued if symptoms are severe or worsening. Valproic acid and divalproex sodium : Hepatoto xicity, including fatalities, have been reported, usually during the first 6 months of treatment. Serum liver tests are required and patients should be monitored closely. There is an increased risk of valproate - induced acute liver failure and resultant deaths in patients with mitochondrial disease. Valproic acid and divalproex sodium are contraindicated in patients known to have mitochondrial disorders caused by polymerase gamma (POLG) gene mutation s, and in children < 2 years of age who are suspected of having a mitochondrial disorder. There is a risk to fetuses exposed in utero, particularly neural tube defects, other major malformations, and decreased intelligenc e quotient (IQ). Valproate should not be given to a woman of childbearing potential unless the drug is essential to the management of her medical condition, and women should use effective contraception while using valproate. Pancreatitis, including fatal hemorrhagic cases, has occurred. Patients and guardians should be warned that abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and/or anorexia can be symptoms of pancreatitis that require prompt medical evaluation. 163 Data as of August 4, 2020 KM-U/KS-U/AKS Page 21 of 28 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Vigabatrin: Vigabatrin can cause permanent bilateral conc entric visual field constriction, including tunnel vision that can result in disability. In some cases, vigabatrin may also damage the central retina and may decrease visual acuity. Baseline and periodic vision assessment are recommended. However, this assessment cannot always prevent vision damage, and once detected, vision loss due to vigabatrin is not reversible. Vigabatrin should be withdrawn from patients who fail to show substantial clinical benefit. Due to the risks of vision loss, vigabatrin is available only through a REMS program (FDA REMS 2020). Healthcare providers who prescribe vigabatrin and pharmacies that dispense the product must be specially certified. Each patient must be enrolled in the REMS program. Prescribers must ensure that periodic visual monitoring is performed and report any AE suggestive of vision loss to the vigabatrin REMS program. Everolimus is an antineoplastic, immunosuppressant agent associated with several AEs. The most common AE that occurred in trials for TSC-associated partial -onset seizures was stomatitis.

These products vary in terms of their indications for specific seizure types and indications other than epilepsy. Overall, the anticonvulsants have demonstrated efficacy for their FDA -approved uses. When possible, monotherapy with a single AED is the preferred treatment approach. Patients who are refractory to monotherapy may be treated with combination therapy. When considering combination therapy, it is recommended to combine medications with different mechanisms of action and AE profiles. Comparative efficacy data for the management of epilepsy are limited. Tolerability and safety are as important as efficacy in determining the overall effectiveness of epilepsy treatment. Both systemic AEs and neurologic AEs commonly occur. Some AEDs are associated with rare but serious AEs, and careful patient selection and monitoring are required. Epilepsy management can be complex and is often performed by neurologists. A variety of AEDs should be available to allow clinicians to select the most clinically appropriate agent for individual patients. Anticonvulsants are also established as effective for several non- epilepsy indications, including (but not limited to) bipolar disorder, migraine prophylaxis, and neuropathic Eisai Inc.; April 2020.

Therapeutic Class Overview Respiratory Beta -Agonist Combination Agents INTRODUCTION Respiratory beta 2-agonist combination agent s include a beta 2-agonist combined with an inhaled corti costeroid (ICS), inhaled anticholinergic, or both. Beta 2-agonists can be short -acting beta 2-agonists (SABA) or long- acting beta 2-agonists (LABA); most combinations contain a LABA. Similarly, inhaled anticholinergics , also known as muscarinic antagonists , can -acting muscarinic antagonists (SAMA) or long -acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA) ; most combinations contain a LAMA. Individual beta 2-agonist combinations are Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for the treatment of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or both. All combinations of a beta 2-agonist and an ICS are indicated for the treatment of asthma, and some are additionally indicated for the treatment of COPD. Combinations of a beta 2-agonist and an anticholinergic medication are indicated for COPD . The 2 available triple combination agent s (consist ing of LAMA/LABA/ICS) are indicated for COPD and one is also indicated for asthma. Refer to Table s 2A, 2B, and 2C for specific indications for each product. Asthm a is a chronic lung disease that inflames and narrows the airways in the lungs . Asthma causes recurring periods of wheezing, chest tightness, shortness of breath, and coughing. Asthma affects people of all ages, but most often starts during childhood. In 2018, asthma affected an estimated 19.2 million adults and 5.5 million children in the United States (U.S.) (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] 2020 , National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute [NHLBI] Web site). COPD is characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation due to airway and/or alveolar abnormalities. The abnormalities are usually caused by exposure to noxious particles or gases, and cigarette smoking isa key risk factor . Airflow limitation is caused by a combination of small airway disease (eg, obstructive bronchiolitis) and parenchymal destruction (emphysema). The most common symptoms of COPD include dyspnea, cough, and sputum production (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease [GOLD] 2020 a). COPD affects 6.4% of the U.S. population and is a major contributor to mortality from chronic lower respiratory diseases, the fourth leading cause of death in the U .S. (CDC 2019).

CLINICAL EFFICACY SUMMARY Beta 2-agonist/corticosteroid combinations for asthma and COPD Comparisons to placebo, monotherapy, combined use of individual components, varied treatments, or usual care: Numerous trials have compared the combination ICS/LABA products to their respective individual components as monotherapy, and in general, results have demonstrated that administration of the combination product is more effective than monotherapy for improving lung function and/or achieving control of symptoms in asthma and COPD ( Bateman et al 2001, Bateman et al 2004, Bateman et al 2006, Bateman et al 2014, Bateman et al 2018, Berger et al 2010, Bernstein et al 2015, Bleecker et al 2014, Calverley et al 2003, Corren et al 2007, Eid et al 2010, FDA AirDuo RespiClick Medical Review 2017, Gappa et al 2009, Hanania et al 2003, Jenkins et al 2006, Kerwin et al 2009, Kerwin et al 2013, Kuna et al 2006, Lalloo et al 2003, Lundback et al 2006, Martinez et al 2013, Meltzer et al 2012, Morice et al 2007, Murphy et al 2008, Nathan et al 2006, Nelson et al 2003a, Noonan et al 2006, O'Byrne et al 2014, Pearlman et al 2004, Pearlman et al 2017, Pohl et al 2006, Raphael et al 2018, Rennard et al 2009, Rodrigo et al 2016, Rodrigo et al 2017, Sharafkaneh et al 2012, Sher et al 2017 , Tal et al 2002, Tang et al 2019, Tashkin et al 2008, Vaessen -Verberne et al 2010, Vestbo et al 2005, Weinstein et al 2010). Results for reducing COPD exacerbations have been inconsistent (Dransfield et al 2013, Ohar et al 2014). A randomized, double -blind , double -dummy tr ial 1227 -squares mean 1.016 to 1.237) for day 1 forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) area under the curve and 1.069 (90% CI, 0.938 to 1.220) for day 29 trough FEV 1 (Ng et al 2019). The efficacy of the AirDuo Digihaler (fluticasone propionate/salmeterol) was based primarily on the dose- ranging trials and the confirmatory trials Digihaler contains a built-in electronic module which detects, records, and stores data on inhaler events, including peak inspiratory flow rate (L/minute), for transmission a mobile App. There is no evidence the use of the App leads to improved clinical outcomes, including safety and effectiveness ( AirDuo Prescribing information 2020 ) Although a synergistic effect of combination inhalers has been suggested by some data, overall there are similar efficacy between the administration of the combination ICS/LABA products and their individual components used in combination (Chapman et al 1999, Jenkins et al 2006 , Marceau et al 2006, Nelson et al 2003b, Noonan et al 2006, Perrin et al 2010, Rosenhall et al 2002 ). Improved adherence with combination inhalers has also been suggested but not been shown conclusively ( Marceau et al 2006, P errin et al 2010). 174 Data as of September 29, 2020 ALS /KMR Page 4 of 23 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

A multicenter clinical trial (N = 181) compared mometasone furoate/formoterol 50/5 mcg to mometasone furoate 50 mcg in patients with asthma 5 to less than 12 years of age. The primary efficacy endpoint, defined as the change from baseline to week 12 in 60- minute morning post -dose % predicted FEV 1, was significantly improved with compared propionate/salmeterol 500/50 mcg twice daily to its individual components and to placebo over a 3-year period in patients with COPD (Calverley et al 2007) . The primary endpoint, time to death from any cause, for the combination vs placebo failed to reach statistical significance (12.6% vs 15.2%; p = 0.052). However, the difference in mortality between the combination therapy and fluticasone monotherapy did reach statistical significance (12.6% vs 16%; p = 0.007). Treatment with the combination regimen resulted in significantly fewer exacerbations, improved health status, and improved lung function compared with placebo. A large, double- blind, randomized trial (SUMMIT; N = 16,590) evaluated of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol vs fluticasone furoate alone, vilanterol alone, or placebo in a population of patients with moderate COPD and heightened cardiovascular risk (age 60 years and receiving medication for >2 of the following: hypercholesterolemia, hy pertension, arterial disease) (Vestbo et al 2016a). Compared with placebo, there was no significant benefit or worsening in all-cause mortality with co mbination therapy (hazard ratio [ HR], 0. 88; 95% CI , 0.74 to 0.137]) with the components (fluticasone furoate HR, 0. 91 [95% CI, 0.77 CI, 0.81 to 1.14; p = 0 .655]). Composite cardiovascular events were also similar in the 4 groups (3.9% to 4.4%). All treatments reduced the risk of moderate to severe COPD exacerbations compared to placebo, with percent reductions of 29% (95% CI, 22 to 35), 12% (95% CI, 4 to 19), and 10% (95% CI, 2 to 18) in the fluticasone and trial (Salford Lung Study; the use of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 100/25 mcg daily to continuation of usual care in a real -world patient population in the United Kingdom (Vestbo et al 2016b). Enrolled patients had COPD, had experienced 1 exacerbations in the previous 3 years, and were taking regular maintenance inhaler therapy ( 1 long-acting bronchodilators ; ICS alone or in combination with a long- acting bronchodilator; or a combination of ICS, LABA, and LAMA). The primary endpoint, the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations among patients who had experienced an exacerbation wit hin 1 year before the trial, was 1.74 per year in the fluticasone furoate/vilanterol group and 1.90 per year in the usual -care group, for a difference of 8.4% (95% CI, 1.1 to 15.2; p = 0.02). Serious adverse events, including pneumonia, were similar between the 2 groups. A meta -analysis of 19 trials evaluated the use of ICS/LABA combinations compared to placebo in patients with COPD , and demonstrated a significant reduction in exacerbation rate between fluticasone propionate/salmeterol and placebo and between budesonide/formoterol and placebo ( Nannini et al 2013a ). For the number of patients who experienced 1 exacerbations , the differences fluticasone propionate/salmeterol vs placebo and mometasone furoate/formoterol 200/10 mcg strength however, the mometasone furoate/formoterol 400/10 mcg strength was associated with a lower proportion of patients experiencing 1 exacerbation. This meta -analysis also demonstrated that when results for all combined inhalers vs placebo were pooled, there was an overall reduction in mortality (odds ratio [OR], 0.82; 95% CI, 0.68 to 0.99). A meta -analysis of 14 trials evaluated the use of ICS/LABA combinations compared to use of the same LABA as monotherapy in patients with COPD (Nannini et al 2012) . This analysis demonstrated that exacerbation rates were reduced with ICS/LABA combination therapy compared to LABA monotherapy (rate ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.68 to 0.84). However, there was a significant increase in the incidence of pneumonia with combination therapy compared to LABA monotherapy (OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.2 to 2.01). A meta -analysis of 15 trials evaluated the use of ICS/LABA combinations compared to use of ICS monotherapy in patients with COPD (Nannini et al 2013b ). This analysis demonstrated that exacerbation rates were significantly reduced with ICS/LABA combination therapy vs ICS monotherapy (rate ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.80 to 0.94). Adverse events were similar between treatments; pneumonia rates as diagnosed by chest x -ray were lower than those reported in earlier trials . A meta -analysis of 14 trials (total N Dwan et al 2016). Primary endpoints included health- related quality of life (HRQoL) and severe asthma exacerbations (defined by hospital admission or treatment with oral corticosteroids). Fewer than half of the studies reported on these primary endpoints, and there were few opportunities to combine results from the included studies. One of the 14 studies evaluated HRQoL (as measured by the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire [AQLQ]) for 175 Data as of September 29, 2020 ALS /KMR Page 5 of 23 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

No comparisons relevant to the primary outcomes were found for fluticasone furoate/vilanterol at a higher dose (200/25 mcg) vs placebo. There was insufficient evidence to assess whether once -daily fluticasone furoate/vilanterol had better or worse safety or efficacy compared to twice -daily fluticasone propionate/salmeterol. The authors stated that firm conclusions could not be drawn due to the limited number of studies, variety of endpoints, and short duration of most trials. Several large studies focused primarily on safety endpoints, with efficacy endpoints as secondary (Peters et al 2016, Stempel et al 2016a, Stempel et al 2016b) . The studies compared the use of ICS/LABA combinations to ICS monotherapy in patients with asthma. These studies each demonstrated non -inferiority of the ICS/LABA combination to ICS monotherapy for the risk of serious asthma -related events, offering reassurance for the safety of these agents. A randomized, double -blind study ( AUSTRI ; N = 11,679) enrolled adults and adolescents (age 12 years) with persistent asthma and a history of exacerbation within the previous year ( Stempel et al 2016a). propionate/salmeterol or fluticasone propionate monotherapy for 26 weeks. Patients were stratified by their baseline asthma control questionnaire (ACQ) -6 score and current asthma medication to determine the fluticasone propionate dose (100, 250, or 500 mcg twice daily) and were randomized to receive this dose with or without concomitant salmeterol. The primary safety endpoint was the first serious asthma-related event, a composite endpoint that included death, endotracheal intubation, and hospitalization. There were 36 events in 34 patients in the fluticasone propionate/salmeterol group and 38 events in 33 patients in the fluticasone propionate group (HR, 1.03; 95% CI, non- inferior to fluticasone propionate for this endpoint. There were no asthma- related deaths. The main efficacy endpoint was the first severe asthma exacerbation, defined as asthma deterioration leading to the use of systemic glucocort icoids for 3 days or an asthma -related hospitalization or emergency department visit leading to the use of systemic glucocorticoids. At least 1 severe asthma exacerbation was reported in 480 patients (8%) in the fluticasone propionate/salmeterol group and in 597 patients (10%) in the fluticasone propionate group (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.89; p < 0.001). A similarly designed trial (VESTRI; N = 6208) enrolled pediatric patients 4 to 11 years of age ( Stempel et al 2016b). Enrolled patients had a history of exacerbation within the previous year and consistent use of asthma medication during the 4 weeks before enrollment. Patients were randomized, on the basis of pretrial medication, Childhood Asthma Control Test (C -ACT) score, and exacerbation history, to mcg or 250 mcg twice daily for 26 weeks. The primary safety endpoint, the first serious asthma -related event (death, intubation, or hospitalization), occurred in 27 patients in the fluticasone propionate/salmeterol group and 21 patients in the fluticasone propionate group (HR, 1.28; 95% CI, to fluticasone propionate ( p = 0.006). All of the events were asthma- related hospitalizations; there were no deaths or asthma- related intubations in either group. The primary efficacy endpoint was the first severe asthma exacerbation, defined as asthma deterioration leading to the use of systemic glucocorticoids for 3 days or a depot injection of glucocorticoids. One or more severe asthma exacerbations occurred in 8.5% of patients in the fluticasone propionate/salmeterol group and 10.0% of patients in the fluticasone propionate group (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.01). An additional randomized, double-blind trial (N = 11,693) compared the safety of formoterol/budesonide to budesonide alone in patients 12 years of age ( Peters et al 2016 ). Enrolled patients were receiving daily asthma medication and had experienced 1 exacerbation in the previous year. Patients were stratified to a dose level of budesonide on the basis of asthma control and prior treatment. Patients were then randomized to receive budesonide/formoterol (2 actuations of actuations of 80 mcg or 160 mcg) twice daily for 26 weeks. The primary safety endpoint, the first serious adverse event (death, intubation, or hospitalization), occurred in 43 of 5,846 patients receiving budesonide/formoterol and 40 of 5,847 patients receiving formoterol alone (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.70 to 1.65); this demonstrated non -inferiority for budesonide/formoterol vs budesonide alone. Two of the events (both in the budesonide/formoterol group) were asthma -related deaths; the remaining events were asthma - related hospitalizations. The primary efficacy endpoint, the first asthma exacerbation (defined as a deterioration of asthma requiring systemic glucocorticoids for 3 days, inpatient hospitalization for asthma, or an emergency department visit for 176 Data as of September 29, 2020 ALS /KMR Page 6 of 23 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

A trial of 4215 patients 12 years of age with mild asthma found that budesonide/ formoterol as needed was noninferior to budesonide twice daily for the reduction of severe asthma exacerbation. The annualized rate of severe exacerbations was 0.11 (95% CI, 0.10 to 0.13) and 0.12 (95% CI, 0.10 to 0.14), respectively (rate ratio, 0.97; upper one-sided 95% confidence limit, 1.16) However, budesonide/formoterol was inferior to budesonide for symptom control as the change in ACQ -5 score showed a difference of 0.11 units (95% CI, 0.07 to 0.15) in favor of budesonide maintenance therapy (Bateman et al 2018). A 52-week randomized trial of adults with mild asthma (N = 675) revealed that budesonide/formoterol administered as needed was superior to albuterol as needed (relative rate, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.33 to 0.72; p < 0.001) and similar to budesonide with albuterol as needed (relative rate, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.70 to 1.79; p=0.65) for prevention of asthma exacerbations. The rate of severe exacerbations was lower with budesonide/formoterol compared with albuterol as needed (relative risk, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.86) and budesonide with albuterol (relative risk, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.96) (Beasley et al 2019). Comparisons between different ICS/LABA combinations There are some data available comparing different combination ICS/LABA products for the treatment of COPD. One crossover study comparing budesonide/formoterol to fluticasone propionate/salmeterol demonstrated no significant difference between products for the primary endpoint, the increase from baseline in peak expiratory flow 5 minutes after the morning dose (Partridge et al 2009) . However, the mean morning FEV 1 improved more with budesonide/formoterol at 5 minutes and 15 minutes post -dose compared to fluticasone propionate/salmeterol. Several published trials compared fluticasone furoate/vilanterol to fluticasone propionate/salmeterol in patients with COPD. Three of the trials were published together; pooled results demonstrated a greater improvement with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol mcg once daily compared to mcg twice daily on the primary endpoint, the weighted mean (wm) FEV 1 (0 to 24 hr) (Dransfield et al 2014 ). However, 2 of these 3 trials did not demonstrate a significant difference on this endpoint. An additional trial compared fluticasone propionate/salmeterol 500/50 mcg twice daily and found no significant difference between groups on the wm FEV 1 (0 to 24 hr) ( Agusti et al 2014). There have been several trials comparing combination ICS/LABA products to one another for the treatment of asthma. Several head -to-head trials have compared budesonide/formoterol to fluticasone propionat e/salmeterol. The trials varied in their design and the doses of medications. In general, these head -to-head trials have failed to demonstrate that one product is consistently superior to the other. Some trials showed benefits for fluticasone propionate/sa lmeterol on some endpoints ( Dahl et al 2006, Fitzgerald et al 2005, Price et al 2007); some showed benefits for budesonide/formoterol ( Aalbers et al 2004 , Palmqvist et al 2001), and another showed no significant differences between the 2 products ( Busse et al 2008). A meta -analysis of 5 trials comparing fluticasone propionate/salmeterol 250/50 mcg twice daily vs varied doses of budesonide/formoterol twice daily failed to demonstrate significant differences in exacerbations, asthma- related serious adverse e vents, FEV 1, rescue medication use, symptom scores, or peak expiratory flow (Lasserson et al 2011 ). A to fluticasone for mometasone/formoterol for the primary endpoint of FEV 1 area under the curve (AUC ) (0 to 12 hr) (Bernstein et al 2011 ). Treatment with mometasone/formoterol demonstrated a rapid onset of action, with significantly greater effects on FEV 1 at all time points up to 30 minutes post -dose compared to fluticasone propionate/salmeterol. Other secondary endpoints were not significantly different between A head- to-head 250/50 mcg twice daily demonstrated no significant differences between treatments on the primary endpoint, the wm FEV 1 (0 to 24 hr) (Woodcock et al 2013) . There were also no significant differences in key secondary endpoints, including the time to onset of bronchodilator effect , percentage of patients obtaining 12% and 200 mL increase from baseline in FEV 1 at 12 hours and 24 hours, and change from baseline in trough FEV 1. Another trial comparing fluticasone furoate/vilanterol evening trough FEV 1 at week 24 ( Bernstein et al 2018).

A double -blind, double -dummy, 2-year trial ( N propionate/salmeterol 250/50 mcg twice daily to tiotropium 18 mcg in patients with COPD (Wedzicha et al 2008 ). This trial demonstrated no significant difference between groups in the rate of exacerbations or post -dose FEV 1. The study demonstrated higher mortality in the tiotropium group (6%) compared to the fluticasone propionate/salmeterol group (3%). This study was limited by the high number of withdrawals, which were unevenly distributed between the study arms. A double -blind, double -dummy, 12 -week trial ( N = 623) evaluated the use of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 100/25 mcg daily and tiotropium 18 mcg daily in patients with moderate -to-severe COPD and an increased cardiovascular risk (Covelli et al 2016 ). There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint, the change from baseline in wm FEV 1 (0 to 24 hr). Minor differences were noted in some secondary efficacy endpoints and in the safety profiles. Pneumonia occurred more frequently in the fluticasone furoate/vilanterol group, and 2 patients in the tiotropium group died following cardiovascular events. The duration of this trial was not long enough to allow any firm conclusions about the relative efficacy and safety of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol vs tiotropium . In a Cochrane review that included the Covelli et al 2016 trial and 1 additional 12 week trial comparing tiotropium to fluticasone furoate/vilanterol (N = 880 across both trials), there were no differences between treatments when considering the following outcomes: mortality, COPD exacerbation, pneumonia, St. George's respiratory questionnaire (SGRQ ) score, hospital admissions, or use of rescue medication ( Sliwka et al 2018). Several trials have evaluated the potential benefits of adding a combination ICS/LABA to tiotropium vs the use of tiotropium alone in patients with COPD. These trials generally demonstrated an improvement in FEV 1 and some other lung function, symptom score, and quality- of-life endpoints ( Hanania et al 2012, Lee et al 2016, Rojas -Reyes et al 2016, Welte et al 2009). Some trials (Lee et al 2016, Welte et al 2009) also demonstrated a reduction in the risk of COPD exacerbations or severe exacerbations ; however, other trials and a meta- analysis have not confirmed a significant benefit for exacerbations ( Aaron et al 2007, Hanania et al 2012, Karner et al 2011, Rojas -Reyes e t al 2016). Beta 2-agonist/anticholinergic combinations for COPD Comparisons of combination beta 2-agonist/anticholinergic products to bronchodilator m onotherapy : Numerous trials have compared the combination beta 2-agonist/ anticholinergic products to their respective individual components as monotherapy, and in general, results have demonstrated that administration of the combination product is more effective than monotherapy for improving lung function and/or achieving control of symptoms in COPD (Bateman et al 2015, Beeh et al 2015, Bone et al 1994, Buhl et al 2015, Celli et al 2014, Decramer et al 2014, Donohue et al 2013, Dorinsky et al 1999, D'Urzo et al 2014, Friedman et al 1999, Hanania et al 2017, Kerwin et al 2017a, Mahler et al 2015, Maltais et al 2019a, Martinez et al 2017, Sethi et al 2019, Singh et al 2014 ). A randomized phase 3 study of patients with COPD (N = 1594) found that twice -daily aclidinium/formoterol improved lung function compared to once-daily tiotropium by week 24 ( Sethi et al 2019). PINNACLE- 4, a randomized phase 3 study of 1756 patients with moderate -to-severe COPD, showed that glycopyrrolate/formoterol significantly improved predose trough FEV at week 24 compared with glycopyrrolate monotherapy, formoterol monotherapy, or placebo (all p < 0.0001). The combination therapy also i mproved other lung function endpoints compared with individual agents or placebo ( Lipworth et al 2018). A double -blind, double -dummy, 12 -week trial (N = 494) compared the use of umeclidinium/vilanterol 62.5/25 mcg daily to tiotropium 18 mcg daily in patients with COPD who had been treated with tiotropium monotherapy at the time of enrollment (Kerwin et al 2017a). The primary endpoint, trough FEV 1, showed improved efficacy in the group that stepped up to combination therapy, with a between-group difference of 88 mL (95% CI, 45 to 131; p < 0.001). Improvements with umeclidinium/vilanterol were also observed in some secondary endpoints, including the use of rescue medication use and transition dyspnea index (TDI) score. A Cochrane review (N = 7 trials; 5921 participants) found an improvement in dyspnea, lung function, and number of responders with fixed -dose aclidinium/formoterol compared to monotherapy with individual agents or placebo in patients with stable COPD. However, no significant differences in exacerbations, hospital admissions, mortality, and adverse events were found with fixed- dose aclidinium/formoterol compared to aclidinium, formoterol, or placebo monotherapy (Ni et al 2018). A post hoc pooled analysis of 3 studies (N = 1747) showed improved trough FEV 1 with umeclidinium/vilanterol compared with tiotropium (p < 0.001) patients with al A large, trial (N = 7880) of patients with COPD and a history of exacerbations did not find a difference in the rate of exacerbations between LAMA/LABA therapy with tiotropium/ olodaterol vs LAMA therapy tiotropium risk [ p = 0.0498) ( Calverley et al 2018). 178 Data as of September 29, 2020 ALS /KMR Page 8 of 23 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

In a meta- analysis of 6 randomized trials in patients with COPD, tiotropium/olodaterol resulted in similar changes in lung function and similar tolerability compared to tiotropium alone ( He and Lin 2020 ). A systematic review of 23 studies of beta 2-agonist/anticholinergic combinations compared to their monocomponents and to other single -agent treatments in patients with COPD was conducted (Price et al 2016). The analysis demonstrated that beta 2-agonist/anticholinergic combinations significant ly improved lung function compared to their individual components. These combinations generally improved other outcomes compared to monotherapies as well, including symptoms and health status, but there were some discrepancies between lung function results and these patient - reported outcomes. A systematic review and network meta -analysis (N = 74 trials; 74,832 participants) of SAMAs, LABAs, LAMA/LABAs and LABA/ ICSs for maintenance treatment of At 12 and 24 weeks, LAMA, LAMA/ LABAs , and LABA/ ICSs led to a significantly greater improvement in trough FEV 1 compared with placebo and SAMA monotherapy. With the exception of aclidinium/formoterol, all other LAMA/LABA therapies were superior to LAMA monotherapy and LABA/ICS therapy in improving trough FEV 1. Furthermore, LAMA/LABA therapy had the highest probability of being the best treatment for in FEV 1 improvement; similar trends were observed for the TDI and SGRQ scores. Authors concluded that there were no significant differences among the LAMAs and LAMA/LABAs within their respective classes ( Aziz et al 2018 ). A systematic review and meta- analysis (N = 8 trials) compared tiotropium 5 or 18 mcg with LAMA/LABA therapy in patients with moderate- to-severe COPD; ICS therapy was also allowed and use ranged from 33.7% to 54.4% among included trials. Therapy with LABA/LAMA was superior to tiotropium monotherapy for all of the following outcomes at 12 and 24 weeks: FEV 1 peak and trough, SGRQ responder rate, mean SGRQ score, and use of rescue medication. At 12 weeks, LABA/LAMA improved FEV 1 trough by 63 m L compared to tiotropium alone (95% CI, 39.2 to 86.8; p < 0.01). During the same time period, LABA/LAMA improved mean SGRQ responder rate by 19% (rate ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.28; p < 0.01) and reduced SGRQ total score by 1.87 points (95% CI, -2.72 to -1.02; p < 0.01) compared to tiotropium ( Han et al 2018). Comparisons of c ombination beta 2-agonist/anticholinergic products to each other or to other bronchodilator combinations Several head -to-head trials between different LAMA/LABA combinations have been published. An 8-week, open- label, crossover trial compared umeclidinium/vilanterol and tiotropium/ 236 patients with COPD (Feldman et al 2017). The primary endpoint, change from baseline in trough FEV 1, was shown to be greater for umeclidinium/vilanterol, with a difference of 52 mL (95% CI, 28 to 77; p < 0.001 for superiority in the intention- to-treat population). Effects on secondary endpoints were mixed, with umeclidinium/vilanterol demonstrating a small improvement in rescue medication use but no significant differences in COPD Assessment Test (CAT) scores (a health status questionnaire) or EXACT Respiratory Symptoms (E -RS) scores at most weekly assessments . Two 12 -week, double- blind, crossover tr ials compared glycopyrrolate/indacaterol to umeclidinium/vilanterol a total of 712 patients with COPD ( Kerwin et al 2017b ). The primary endpoint, FEV 1 AUC (0 to 24 hr), was similar between treatment arms in both studies, with differences for glycopyrrolate/indacaterol vs umeclidinium/vilanterol of -11.5 mL (95% CI, - 26.9 to 3.8) and -18.2 mL (95% CI, -34.2 to -2.3) in Studies 1 and 2, respectively. Although the trials failed to demonstrate noninferiority of glycopyrrolate/indacaterol to umeclidinium/vilanterol due to the noninferiority margin used in the study methodology, the differences between treatments were not considered clinically meaningful. A 24-week, double -blind, double -dummy, randomized phase 3 trial 2019b). One of the primary endpoints , peak change from baseline in FEV 1 within 2 hours post-dose over 24 weeks, was similar between glycopyrrolate/formoterol and showed improved outcomes for another primary endpoint, change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough FEV 1 over 24 weeks, compared with difference, -87.2 mL; 97.5% CI, -117.0 to -57.4). The trial did not reveal any clinically meaningful differences in symptoms between the 2 treatments. A 12-week, non- inferiority, randomized, double- blind, triple- dummy, parallel (N = 967) compared umeclidinium/vilanterol ( 62.5/25 mcg once daily ) daily) plus indacaterol (150 mcg once daily) (Kalberg et al 2016). When comparing trough FEV 1 on day 85, umeclidinium/vilanterol demonstrated non -inferiority to combination treatment with tiotropium and indacaterol. Other measures, including rescue medication use, TDI focal scores, and SGRQ scores, were also similar between both treatment groups on day 85 (p values not provided). 179 Data as of September 29, 2020 ALS /KMR Page 9 of 23 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. A meta -analysis of 26 randomized controlled trials comparing the indacaterol/glycopyrrolate, to tiotropium alone found that umeclidinium/vilanterol was comparable to other LAMA/LABA fixed -dose combination agents with respect to trough FEV 1, SGRQ scores, TDI focal scores, and need for rescue medication use ( Huisman et al 2015). Several systematic reviews/meta -analyses compared various LAMA/LABA combinations ( Calzetta et al 2016, Schlueter et al 2016, Siddiqui et al 2019, Sion et al 2017 ). Limitations to these analyses included the fact that trials evaluated some formulations/dose regimens not avail able in the U.S. and did not include the more recently approved products in some cases. Additionally, comparisons between different combinations were based on indirect data. Overall, these meta- analyses demonstrated that all LAMA/LABA combinations showed improved lung function vs monocomponents , with few differences among products across lung function and patient -reported endpoints. The analysis by Sion et al noted that both glycopyrrolate/indacaterol and umeclidinium/vilanterol appeared to improve lung function to a greater extent than tiotropium/ olodaterol at 12 weeks, with differences in trough FEV 1 of 52 mL (95% credible interval [CrI], 18 to 86) and 38 mL (95% CrI, 13 to 63), respectively. The Schlueter et al meta -analysis of 27 trials (N = 30,361) including fixed -dose combination agents (aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 in efficacy, exacerbations, and discontinuation rates ( Schlueter et al 2016). Safety profiles were also similar among the products. The only statistically significant result indicated that umeclidinium/vilanterol appeared to improve lung function to a greater extent than aclidinium/formoterol at 24 to 26 weeks (difference of 61 mL; 95% CrI, 18 to 103; in favor of umeclidinium/vilanterol). ICS/LABA compared to LAMA/LABA combinations for COPD A randomized, double -blind, 12- ( N fluticasone propionate/salmeterol 500/50 mcg twice daily in patients with moderate to severe COPD and no exacerbations in the previous year (Singh et al 2015 ). It should be noted that the dose of fluticasone propionate was higher than what is recommended in the U.S. for treatment of COPD. Treatment with umeclidinium/vilanterol resulted in greater improvement in lung function than fluticasone propionate/salmeterol, with a difference of 80 mL (95% CI, 46 to 113) in the wm FEV 1 (0 to 24 hr) and a difference of 90 mL (95% CI, 55 to 125) in trough FEV 1. Effects on rescue bronchodilator use, mean TDI focal score, and SGRQ total scores, and the incidence of adverse events, were similar between groups. Two randomized, double -blind, 12- week trials ( N = 707 and N = 700; reported together) umeclidinium/vilanterol 62.5/25 mcg daily to fluticasone propionate/salmeterol 250/50 mcg twice in patients with moderate to severe COPD without exacerbations in the previous year ( Donohue et al 2015). These trials also demonstrated a greater improvement in lung function endpoints for umeclidinium/vilanterol compared to flutica sone propionate/salmeterol, with differences in wm FEV 1 (0 to 24 hr) and trough FEV 1 ranging from 74 to 101 mL (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). Adverse event rates and effects on TDI score and SGRQ were similar between groups. A randomized, double -blind, 26- week trial (ILLUMINATE; N = to twice daily in patients with COPD and a history of 1 exacerbation during the previous year ( Vogelmeier et al 2013). The dosing regimens for indacaterol/glycopyrrolate and fluticasone propionate/salmeterol evaluated in this study are different from those available and/or recommended for COPD in the U.S. The primary endpoint, FEV 1 AUC (0 to 12 hr), was significantly higher with indacaterol/glycopyrrolate than fluticasone propionate/salmeterol, with a treatment difference of 138 mL (95% CI, 100 to 176; p < 0.0001). Benefits were also seen for indacaterol/glycopyrrolate for some secondary endpoints, including additional lung function measures, change from baseline in rescue medication use, and TDI focal score; the difference in SGRQ was not statistically significant. A large, randomized, double- blind, 52- week trial (FLAME; twice daily in patients with COPD and a history of 1 exacerbation during the previous year ( Wedzicha et al 2016 ). Again, these dosing regimens varied from U.S. recommendations. The primary endpoint, the annual rate of all COPD exacerbations, was 11% lower in the indacaterol/glycopyrrolate group than in the fluticasone propionate/salmeterol group (3.59 rate 0.83 to 0.96; p = 0.003). Lung function was also improved to a greater extent with indacaterol/glycopyrrolate , with a difference in trough FEV 1 of 62 mL between groups (p < 0.001). 180 Data as of September 29, 2020 ALS /KMR Page 10 of 23 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

A randomized, double -blind, crossover trial ( N = 229) tiotropium/ olodaterol and 500/50 mcg twice daily in patients with moderate to severe COPD; each patient received each of the 4 treatments for 6 weeks separated by 3- week washout periods (Beeh et al 2016). The lower dose of each combination is the dose available/recommended for COPD in the U.S. The primary endpoint, FEV 1 AUC (0 to 12 hr), was greater for the tiotropium/ olodaterol regimens (range, 295 to 317 mL) than for the fluticasone propionate/salmeterol regimens (range, 188 to 192 mL) (p < 0.0001). FEV 1 AUC (12 to 24 hr) and FEV 1 AUC (0 to 24 hr) also favored tiotropium/ olodaterol . Rates of adverse events were similar among the treatments. A network meta -analysis of 16 randomized controlled trials (N = 17, 734) compared fixed -dose combinations of LABA/LAMA vs ICS/LABA. The analysis showed that umeclidinium/vilanterol, glycopyrrolate/indacaterol, and glycopyrrolate/formoterol were the most effective in improving FEV 1. Glycopyrrolate/indacaterol significantly decreased the risk of exacerbations compa red with fluticasone/salmeterol (Calzetta et al 2019). triple\" inhaler - an inhaler containing 3 active ingredients from 3 different therapeutic classes : an ICS, a LAMA, and a LABA. Two 12 -week randomized studies (N = 619 and N = 620; published together ) evaluated the efficacy and safety of double- blind treatment with umeclidinium 62.5 mcg, umeclidinium 125 mcg, open- label fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 100/25 mcg for the treatment ( Siler et al 2015 ) . In both studies, the primary endpoint, trough FEV 1, was significantly improved with the addition of umeclidinium , with improvement s ranging from 111 to 128 mL (p < 0.001 for all comparisons vs placebo). Improvement was also demonstrated on the secondary endpoint of wm FEV 1 (0 to 6 hr), with improvements ranging from 125 to 153 mL ( p < 0.001 for all comparisons vs placebo). SGRQ results were inconsistent. No substantial benefit was observed with umeclidinium 125 mc g over 62.5 mcg, which is consistent with findings in the umeclidinium monotherapy studies. Once- daily triple therapy with fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol also been compared to twice -daily in a 24- week, 1810) Lipson et al 2017). The formulation/dosing regimen of budesonide/formoterol in this trial is different from the formulation available in the U.S. The trial demonstrated improvements in the change from baseline in trough FEV 1 (difference, 171 mL; 95% CI, 148 (rate CI, 0.49 to 0.86; p = 0.002) . Although the comparator regimen is not available in the U.S., this trial further supports the efficacy of triple inhaler therapy for COPD with fluticasone to fluticasone and umeclidinium/vilanterol in a 52 -week, trial among patients with COPD (IMPACT; Lipson et al 2018 ). The primary endpoint of moderate or severe exacerbations was significantly lower with triple therapy in comparison both with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol (rate ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, umeclidinium/vilanterol (rate ratio, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.81). The annual rate of severe exacerbation resulting in hospitalization was also significantly lower with triple therapy vs umeclidinium/vilanterol (rate ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.78), but not vs fluticasone furoate/vilanterol . The mean change from baseline in trough FEV 1 was significantly increased with triple therapy by 97 and 54 mL vs fluticasone furoate/vilanterol and umeclidinium/vilanterol, respectively. The risk of pneumonia was significantly higher with triple therapy vs umeclidinium/vilanterol (HR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.22 to 1.92), but not vs fluticasone furoate/vilanterol. Significant improvements in SGRQ total scores also occurred with triple therapy vs fluticasone furoate/vilanterol (mean difference, -1.8; 95% CI, -1.8; 95% CI, -2.6 to -1.0). An updated, post hoc mortality analysis of IMPACT was published after the collection of additional vital status data. With known vital status for 99.6% of the intention- to-treat population (n = 10,335), there were 98 deaths (2.36%) in patients on umeclidinium/vilanterol/fluticasone furoate, 109 (2.64%) on vilanterol/fluticasone furoate, and 66 (3.19%) on umeclidinium/vilanterol. For triple therapy, the HR for death was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.53 to 0.99; p = 0.89 ( Lipson et al 2020 ). The FDA noted several statistical and clinical issues with respect to interpretation of the mortality data, and the FDA Pulmonary -Allergy Drugs Advisory Committee voted 14- 1 against a proposed labeling claim that Trelegy Ellipta reduces all -cause mortality in patients with COPD (FDA Trelegy Ellipta briefing document 2020, He alio 2020 ). The 24 - to 52 -week double -blind CAPTAIN trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of triple therapy with Trelegy Ellipta (umeclidinium/vilanterol/fluticasone furoate) for the treatment of asthma in adult patients . 181 Data as of September 29, 2020 ALS /KMR Page 11 of 23 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Umeclidinium/vilanterol/flutica sone furoate was compared to Breo Ellipta (vilanterol/fluticasone furoate). For the comparison of triple vs dual therapy using the lower strength (100 mcg) of fluticasone furoate, there was a significant improvement in the primary endpoint of change in trough FEV 1 at week 24, with a difference of 110 mL (95% CI, 66 to 153; p < 0.0001). The corresponding improvement for the higher strength (200 mcg fluticasone furoate) was also significant at 92 mL (95% CI, 49 to 135) (Lee et al 2020). A numerical improvement in the annualized rate of moderate/severe exacerbations was seen between triple and dual therapy with the lower strength, but the difference did not reach statistical significance (rate ratio, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.61 to 1.01] ; p = 0.060). The exacerbation rate was comparable between triple and dual therapy for the higher strength comparison (rate ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.28; p = Aerosphere (glycopyrrolate/formoterol/budesonide) inhalation aerosol, was FDA- approved in 2020. Safety and efficacy were demonstrated in 2 double -blind trials comparing triple therapy to dual therapy with glycopyrrolate/formoterol (Bevespi Aerosphere) or formoterol/budesonide in patients with COPD ( Ferguson et al 2018, Rabe et al 2020). In the 24- week KRONOS study (N = 1902), the FEV 1 AUC (0 to 4 hr) was significantly improved for triple therapy vs formoterol/budesonide, with a difference of 116 mL (95% CI, 80 to 152; p < 0.0001); the difference in change from baseline in pre- dose trough FEV 1 was nominally significant, with a difference of 74 mL (95% CI, 47 to 102; p < 0.0001). These lung function endpoints were not significantly improved for the triple therapy vs glycopyrrolate/formoterol; however, improvements were demonstrated in some secondary endpoints including SGRQ and the incidence of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations for this comparison ( Ferguson et al 2018). The 52 -week ETHOS study (N = 8588) enrolled patients with a documented history of COPD exacerbation(s) in the preceding year. The primary endpoint of annualized rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations was significantly improved for triple therapy (with the marketed dose) compared to the corresponding doses of either dual therapy. For triple therapy vs glycopyrrolate/formoterol, the rate ratio was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.69 to 0.83; p < 0.001), and for triple therapy vs formoterol/budesonide, the rate ratio was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.79 to 0.96; p = 0.003) (Rabe et al 2020) . CLINICAL GUIDELINES Asthma The National Asthm a Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) guideline from the NHLBI states that the initial treatment of asthma should correspond to the appropriate asthma severity category, and it provides a stepwise approach to asthma management. Long -term control medic ations such as ICS, long- acting bronchodilators, leukotriene modifiers, cromolyn, theophylline, and immunomodulators should be taken daily on a long- term basis to achieve and maintain control of persistent asthma. ICS are the most potent and consistently e ffective long -term asthma control medication. Quick -relief medications such as SABAs and anticholinergics are used to provide prompt relief of bronchoconstriction and accompanying acute symptoms such as cough, chest tightness, and wheezing. Systemic cortic osteroids are important in the treatment of moderate or severe exacerbations because these medications prevent progression of the exacerbation, speed recovery, and prevent relapses ( NHLBI 2007). LABAs are used in combination with ICS for long- term control and prevention of symptoms in moderate or severe persistent asthma. Of the adjunctive treatments available, a LABA is the preferred option to combine with an ICS in patients 12 years of age and older. This combination is also an option in selected patients 5 to 12 years of age. The 2020 Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention report also provides a stepwise approach to asthma management. It recommends as- needed low -dose ICS -formoterol as a preferred controller medication to prevent exacerbations and control symptoms in adult or adolescent patients with infrequent asthma symptoms (eg, < twice a month). If patients remain uncontrolled, an ICS or ICS/LABA is the next preferred controller option. The choice of a specific dose and combination depends on the age of the patient and step within the therapy. As -needed ICS -formoterol is also the preferred reliever medication for adults and adolescents, while as-needed SABAs are the only option for reliever medications in children; of note, a low dose ICS should be taken whenever a SABA is taken. At the highest step of therapy, the patient should be referred for add 2020 GINA report provides interim guidance on the management of asthma in the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) pandemic. Patients with asthma should continue their prescribed asthma medications, including ICS with or without LABA and add- on therapies, during the pandemic. Use of nebulizers should be avoided when possible to prevent transmission of the virus to other patients or healthcare workers ( GINA 2020 ). 182 Data as of September 29, 2020 ALS /KMR Page 12 of 23 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. The available asthma guidelines are generally similar; however, one difference among them is the recommendation of ICS/formoterol as both maintenance and rescue therapy by the GINA guidelines. The NHLBI does not recommend LABA medications for the management of acute asthma symptoms or exacerbations ( GINA 2020, NHLBI 2007). A meta -analysis of 16 randomized controlled trials evaluating the use of a LABA/ICS as single maintenance and reliever therapy found that it was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of asthma exacerbations compared with controller therapy with the same dose of ICS and LABA (rate ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.80) (Sobieraj et al 2018 ). Of the 16 trials, 15 studied budesonide/formoterol in a dry powder inhaler. Results we re similar in comparisons with doses of ICS and LABA controller therapy that were higher than the combined LABA/ICS, and in comparison with ICS controller therapy only. For a step- down process when asthma is well -controlled, GINA recommends reducing the ICS dose or switching to as - needed low dose ICS/formoterol (GINA 2020 ). Chipps et al propose using ICS/LABA combination with lower doses of ICS or switching from ICS to low- dose ICS/LABA combinations as patients move from higher to lower steps within asthma therapy ( Chipps et al 2019). A European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society guideline on the management of severe asthma recommends the addition of tiotropium for patients with uncontrolled asthma despite GINA step 4 or 5 or NAEPP step 5 therapy, and a trial of chronic macrolide therapy to reduce exacerbations in patients who require additional control despite GINA step 5 or NAEPP step 5 therapy ( Holguin et al 2020). COPD The 2020 GOLD guidelines state that the management strategy for stable COPD should be predominantly based on an assessment of the patient's symptoms and risk of exacerbations; the risk of exacerbations is based on a patient's exacerbation history. Of note, the 2020 GOLD guidelines no longer recognize the phrase \"asthma- COPD overlap,\" instead, emphasize that asthma and COPD are unique disease states with some similar signs and symptoms. Key recommendations from the GOLD guidelines are as follows (GOLD 2020 a): Inhaled bronchodilators are central to symptom management in COPD and commonly given on a regular basis to prevent or reduce symptoms. Inhaled bronchodilators are recommended over oral bronchodilators. LAMAs and LABAs significantly improve lung function, dyspnea, and health status, and reduce exacerbation rates. LAMAs and LABAs are preferred over short -acting agents except for patients with only occasional dyspnea, and for immediate relief of symptoms in patients already receiving long -acting bronchodilators for maintenance therapy . LAMAs have a greater effect on exacerbation reduction compared to LABAs and decrease hospitalizations. Patients may be started on single long -acting bronchodilator therapy or dual long -acting bronchodilator therapy. In patients with persistent dyspnea on 1 bronchodilator, treatment should be escalated to 2 bronchodilators. Combination treatment with a LABA and LAMA: Reduces exacerbations compared to monotherapy. Increases FEV 1 and reduces symptoms compared to monotherapy. Key points for the use of inhaled medications include the following: The choice of inhaler device must be individually tailored and will depend on factors including the patient's ability and preference. It is essential to provide instructions and to demonstrate the proper inhalation technique when prescribing a device, ensure that inhaler technique is adequate, and re -check at each visit. Inhaler technique and adherence to therapy should be assessed before concluding that the current therapy requires modification. Triple inhaled therapy of LAMA/LABA/ICS improves lung function, symptoms, and health status and reduces exacerbations compared to ICS/LABA , LABA/LAMA, or LAMA monotherapy. A number of recent studies have shown that blood eosinophil counts predict the magnitude of the effect of ICS in preventing exacerbations when added on top of regular maintenance bronchodilator treatment. ICS -containing regimens appear to have little or no effect at a blood eosinophil count < 100/mcL. The threshold of a blood eosinophil count > 300/mcL identifies the top of the continuous relationship between eosinophils and ICS and can be used to identify patients with the greatest likelihood of treatment benefit with ICS. Long -term m onotherapy with ICS is not recommended. Long-term treatment with ICS may be considered in association with LABAs for patients with a history of exacerbations despite treatment with long- acting bronchodilators. Long -term treatment with ICS may cause pneumonia in patients with severe disease. Treatment recommendations are given for patients with COPD based on their GOLD patient group (see Table 3). 183 Data as of September 29, 2020 ALS /KMR Page 13 of 23 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Patients should always seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health provider with any questions regarding a medical condition. Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. Group A: Patients should be offered bronchodilator treatment (short - or long- acting), based on its effect on breathlessness. This should be continued if symptomatic benefit is documented. Group B: Initial therapy should consist of a long- acting bronchodilator (LAMA or LABA). For patients with persistent breathlessness on monotherapy, use of 2 bronchodilators is recommended (LAMA + LABA). For patients with severe breathlessness, initial therapy with 2 bronchodilators may be considered. If the addition of a second bronchodilator does not improve symptoms, it is suggested that treatment could be stepped down to a single bronchodilator; switching to another device or molecules can also be considered. Group C: Initial therapy should be a LAMA. Group D: In general, it is recommended to start therapy with a LAMA. For patients with more severe symptoms, especially dyspnea and/or exercise limitation, LAMA/LABA may be considered for initial treatment. In some patients, initial therapy with an ICS + LABA may be the first choice; these patients may have a history and/or findings suggestive of asthma or blood eosinophil count 300 cells/ \u00b5L. Follow -up treatments: The follow -up treatments apply to any patients receiving maintenance treatment irrespective of the patient GOLD group. For persistent dyspnea: The use of 2 bronchodilators is recommended in patients receiving 1 long- acting bronchodilator and experiencing persistent breathlessness or exer cise limitation . Patients with persistent dyspnea symptoms on LABA + ICS may benefit from LAMA + LABA + ICS. For exacerbations: Patients with persistent exacerbations on long -acting bronchodilator monotherapy may benefit from adding a second long- acting bronchodilator (LAMA + LABA, preferred) or using an ICS + LABA. For patients who have a history and/or findings suggestive of asthma or blood eosinophil count 300 cells/\u00b5L, ICS + LABA is preferred. In patients who develop further exacerbations on LAMA + LABA therapy, alternative pathways include escalation to a LAMA + LABA + ICS if eosinophil count 100 cells/\u00b5L or addition of roflumilast or azithromycin if eosinophil count < 100 cells/\u00b5L. In patients with additional exacerbations on LABA + ICS, patients should try LAMA + LABA + ICS therapy. If patients treated with a LAMA + LABA + ICS still have exacerbations, options for selected patients may include addition of roflumilast, addition of a macrolide, or stopping the ICS. Patients with COPD should continue their usual therapy, including inhaled or oral corticosteroids during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) pandemic Patients with COPD should continue their regular therapy during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) pandemic ; GOLD is not aware of any scientific evidence to support that inhaled (or oral) corticosteroids should be avoided during this epidemic (GOLD 2020b).

Those who complain of dyspnea or exercise intolerance despite dual therapy with LAMA/LABA: use of triple therapy with LAMA/LABA/ICS is recommended over dual t herapy with LAMA/LABA in those patients with a history of 1 exacerbation(s) in the past year requiring antibiotics or oral steroids or hospitalization. Those receiving triple therapy (LAMA/LABA/ICS): it is suggested that the ICS can be withdrawn if the patient has had no exacerbations in the past year. No recommendation is made for or against ICS as an additive therapy to long- acting bronchodilators in patients with COPD and blood eosinophilia, except for those patients with a history of 1 exacerbation( s) in the past year requiring antibiotics or oral steroids or hospitalization, for whom ICS as an additive therapy is suggested. 184 Data as of September 29, 2020 ALS /KMR Page 14 of 23 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. Guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians and the Canadian Thoracic Society for prevention of acute exacerbations of COPD state that LAMA/LABA combinations are effective in reducing acute COPD exacerbations, but do not state that this combination is superior to LAMA monotherapy ( Criner et al 2015 ). SAFETY SUMMARY Beta 2-agonist/corticosteroid combinations Beta 2-agonist/ICS combinations are generally contraindicated for the primary treatment of status asthmaticus or other acute episodes of asthma/COPD where intensive with a severe hypersensitivity to milk proteins. Previously, ICS/LABA combinations had a box ed warning about an increased risk of asthma- related death, which had been observed with the LABA salmeterol . However, the boxed warning was removed from the prescribing information for ICS/LABA combinations in December 2017 based on an FDA review of 4 large clinical safety trials, which demonstrated that these combinations do not result in a significantly increased risk of ast hma-related death, hospitalizations, or the need for intubation compared to ICS alone. There is still a warning/precaution in the prescribing information of ICS /LABA combinations related to the increased risk of asthma -related death with LABA monotherapy . A description of the clinical safety trials with ICS /LABA combinations has been added to the prescribing information for these products (FDA 2017 ). Other key warnings and precautions include: Significant cardiovascular effects and fatalities with excessive use of beta 2-agonists Cardiovascular and/or central ner vous system effects from beta- adrenergic stimulation (seizures, angina, hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia, arrhythmias, nervousness, headache, tremor, palpitation, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, malaise, and insomnia) Paradoxical bronchospasm Hypercort icism and adrenal suppression due to systemic absorption of the corticosteroid The need for caution when transferring patients from systemic corticosteroid therapy (deaths due to adrenal insufficiency have occurred) Lower respiratory tract infections/pneum onia Local infections of the mouth and pharynx with Candida albicans Reduced growth velocity in pediatric patients The potential for dr ug interactions with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors; concomitant use is not recommended due to the potential for increased sys temic effects The potential for developing glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, blurred vision, central serous chorioretinopathy, or cataracts Immunosuppression Hypersensitivity Reduction in bone mineral density It is also important to note that ICS/LABA combinatio ns should not be initiated in the setting of disease deterioration or potentially life- threatening episodes. Commonly reported adverse events ( 5% for at least 1 medication in the class) include oral candidiasis, hoarseness/dysphonia, nasopharyngitis/pharyngitis, pharyngolaryngeal/oropharyngeal pain, sinusitis, upper respiratory tract infection, upper respiratory tract inflammation, bronchitis, cough, headache, gastrointestinal discomfort, and nausea/vomiting. Beta 2-agonist/anticholinergic combinations Both albuterol/ipratropium combination products are contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to atropine or its derivatives. Anoro Ellipta and Duaklir Pressair are contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to any component of the product, as well as in patients with severe hypersensitivity to stating that LABAs increase the risk of asthma -related death. Data from a large placebo -controlled U.S. trial that compared the safety of another LABA (salmeterol) with placebo added to usual asthma therapy showed an increase in asthma- related 185 Data as of September 29, 2020 ALS /KMR Page 15 of 23 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

This finding with salmeterol is considered a class effect of all LABA, including formoterol (an active ingredient in Bevespi Aerosphere (an active ingredient in patients with asthma have not been established, and these products are not indicated for the treatment of asthma. Warnings and precautions are very similar among products, and include the following: Paradoxical bronchospasm: May produce paradoxical bronchospasm, which can be life- threatening. If it occurs, the product should be discontinued and alternative therapy instituted . Cardiovascular effect: Beta 2-agonists can produce a significant cardiovascular effect in some patients, as measured by pulse rate, blood pressure, and/or symptoms. If these symptoms occur, the product may need to be discontinued. In addition, electrocardiogram (ECG) changes may occur. These products should be use d with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension. Ocular effects: Ipratropium and other anticholinergic agents may increase intraocular pressure, which may precipitate or worsen narrow -angle glaucoma. They should be u sed with caution in patients with narrow -angle glaucoma. In addition, patients should avoid spraying product into eyes, as this can cause eye pain and visual symptoms. Urinary retention: Ipratropium and other anticholinergic agents may cause urinary retention. Caution is advised when administering to patients with prostatic hyperplasia or bladder -neck obstruction. The recommended dose should not be exceeded: Fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs in patients with asthma. Hyper may occur. If such a reaction occurs, therapy should be discontinued and alternative treatment considered. Coexisting conditions: Due to the beta 2-agonist component, caution is advised in patients with convulsive disorders, hyperthyroidism, or diabetes mellitus, and in patients who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines. Hypokalemia: -agonists may produce significant hypokalemia in some patients, which has the potential to produce adverse cardiovascular effects. The decrease in serum potassium is usually transient, not requiring supplementation. Drug interactions with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors; increased cardiovascular effects may occur ( Anoro Ellipta only). Reports of anaphylactic reactions in patients with severe milk protein allergy ( Anoro Ellipta only). Deterioration of disease and acute episodes; drug has not been studied in this setting and is not to relieve acute symptoms (Anoro Ellipta, Duaklir Pressair, and Stiolto Respimat only). Adverse reactions are similar among products and include back pain, bronchitis, upper respiratory infection, lung disease, headache, dyspnea, nasopharyngitis/pharyngitis, and cough. In a 12- week trial comparing Combivent Respimat to Combivent inhalation aerosol, rates of adverse reactions were very similar between groups. In a 48- week safety trial, most adverse reactions were similar in type and rate between treatment groups; however, cough occurred more frequently in patients enrolled in the Combivent Respimat group (7%) than the Combivent inhalation aerosol The choice of a specific LAMA/LABA fixed -dose combination product is not based on any difference in the safety profile (Matera et al 2016 ). Triple combination with Trelegy Ellipta include: Severe hypersensitivity to milk proteins or any ingredients in the formulation. Primary treatment of status asthmaticus or acute episodes of COPD or asthma requiring intensive measures Similar to other combination agents for COPD (and/or asthma), Trelegy Ellipta and Breztri Aerosphere have a number of additional warnings and precautions including: Increased risk of asthma- related death Not indicated for treatment of asthma Not initiating in patients with rapidly deteriorating COPD Avoiding excess use Local effects of ICS Risk of pneumonia Immunosuppression Using caution when transferring patients from systemic corticosteroid therapy 186 Data as of September 29, 2020 ALS /KMR Page 16 of 23 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

CONCLUSION Respiratory medications, including bronchodilators and corticosteroids, are a mainstay of treatment for asthma and COPD, and a large amount of clinical evidence supports the safety and efficacy of combination beta 2-agonist agents for these indications. Clinic al trials have demonstrated that the combination products have superior efficacy compared with the individual separate components when given as monotherapy for the treatment of both asthma and COPD. The combination products are generally well tolerated. Several single- ingredient inhalers containing beta 2-agonists, ICS, or anticholinergics are also avail able. Beta 2-agonist combinations offer improved convenience over the use of multiple separate inhalers. Trelegy Ellipta inhaler s combining a LAMA, a LABA, and an ICS . Both agents provide a n alternative to the use of multiple inhalers for patients with COPD in whom triple therapy is indicated; Trelegy Ellipta is also an option for adult patients with asthma who require triple therapy. The GINA guideline s upport s the use of combination ICS/LABA products for long -term control and prevention of symptoms and exacerbations in patients with asthma. Single -agent LABA therapy should not be used for asthma management due to the increased risk of asthma- related death, as well as asthma- related hospitalization in pediatric and adolescent patients. However, recent drug safety information from the FDA states that no significant ly increased risk of serious asthma outcomes has been seen with the use of ICS/LABA combinations, and boxed warnings about this potential risk have been removed from the prescribing information for the ICS/LABA combinations . An advantage of the ICS/LABA combination products is that their use ensures that patients are not using a LABA without a concomitant ICS. In adults and adolescents, low dose ICS -formoterol is the preferred reliever medication. For chronic management of asthma, the preferred controller options consist of ICS -formoterol (on an as-needed basis), ICS, or ICS/LABA depending on the age of a patient and severity of symptoms. GOLD guidelines recommend the use of combination ICS/LABA products as an option for some patients at higher risk of exacerbations , a history and/or findings suggestive of asthma, or blood eosinophil count 300 cells/ \u00b5L; however, the use of 1 or more bronchodilator without an ICS is recommended as first -line treatment for most COPD patients . A LAMA is recommended as first -line treatment in most patients with COPD, with the exception of low -risk patients with milder symptoms , or patients with more severe symptoms. The current asthma and COPD treatment guidelines do not recommend the use of one specific combination produc t over another . The GINA guideline discuss es the use of budesonide/formoterol as the preferred as -needed low -dose ICS/formoterol combination in lower steps of therapy. Administration instructions and inhalation devices vary among products and should be considered in product selection. REFERENCES Aalbers R, Backer V, Kava TT, et al.

Therapeutic Class Overview Calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) inhibitors INTRODUCTION Migraine is a common, recurrent, incapacitating disorder characterized by moderate to severe headaches and disabling features, including nausea, vomiting, neurologic symptoms, photophobia, and phonophobia. Cluster headache is less prevalent than migraine and characterized by attacks of severe, unilateral pain with ipsilateral autonomic symptoms, which occur every other day to multiple times daily during a cluster period (International Headache Society [IHS] 2018, Starling et al 2015). The goals for treatment of migraine are to reverse or stop the progression of a migraine attack. The goals forpreventive treatment are to reduce the frequency, severity and duration of a migraine ( American Headache Society [AHS] 2019 , Katsarava 2012). The International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) includes both cluster headache and migraine as part of a group of primary head ache disorders ( IHS 2018): Chronic migraine is defined as 15 headache days per month for > 3 months with the features of migraine headache for at least 8 mean migraine days per month (MMD). The most common cause of symptoms suggestive of chronic migraine is medication overuse. According to the ICHD, around 50% of patients apparently with chronic migraine revert to an episodic migraine type after drug withdrawal; such patients are in a sense wrongly diagnosed with chronic migraine. In most clinical trials, migraine that is not chronic (ie, < 15 headache days per month) is considered to be episodic migraine, although the condition is not clearly defined in the ICHD . Cluster headache is defined as 5 attacks lasting 15 to 180 minutes every other day to 8 times a day with severe unilateral orbital, supraorbital, and/or temporal pain. Episodic cluster headache attacks occur for a period of 7 days to1 year and are separated by pain -free periods lasting at least 3 months. Common symptoms include nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, conjunctival injection and/or lacrimation, eyelid edema, sweating or face), miosis, ptosis, and/or a sense of restlessness or agitation. Cluster headache is more likely to occur in men, whereas migraines are more likely to occur in women. Migraines have a global prevalence of 15 to 18% and are a leading cause of disability worldwide. Chronic migraine is estimated to occurin 2 to 8% of patients with migraine, whereas episodic migraine occurs in more than 90% of patients . Cluster headache is rare compared to other primary headache disorders. It is estimated to have a prevalence of 0.1% within the general population ( Global Burden of Disease Study [GBD] 2016, Hoffman et al 2018, Lipton et al 2016, Ljubisavljevic et al 2019, Manack et al 2011 ). Treatment s for migraines and cluster headache are divided into acute and preventive therapies. Evidence and reputable guidelines clearly delineate appropriate therapies for episodic migraine treatment and prophylaxis; options stretchacross a wide variety of therapeutic classes and are usually oral therapies. For the prevention of migraines, treatmentoptions include oral prophylactic therapies, injectable prophylactic therapies, and neuromodulator devices. Oral prophylactic migraine therapies have modest efficacy, and certain oral therapies may not be appropriate for individual patients due to intolerability or eventual lack of efficacy. For the treatment of acute migraine, options include triptans, ergots, (5 -HT) 1F receptor agonist . cluster headache, subcutaneous sumatriptan, zolmitriptan nasal spray, and oxygen have the most positive evidence for acute therapy, and suboccipital steroid injections are most effective for prevention (America n Migraine Foundation [AMF] 2020, Marmura et al 2015, Robbins et al 2016, Silberstein et al 2012, Simpson et al 2016) . The calcitonin gene -related peptide ( CGRP ) pathway is important in pain modulation and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved 6 CGRP inhibitors for prevention or treatment of migraine/headache disorder(s). Erenumab -aooe is a fully human monoclonal antibody , which potently binds to the CGRP receptor in a competitive and reversibl e manner with greater selectivity than to other human family bind to the CGRP ligand and block its binding to the receptor. Rimegepant and u brogepant are small molecule oral CGRP receptor antagonists (Dodick et al 2018[b], Edvinsson 2017, Goadsby et al Tepper et al 2017 ). Two CGRP inhibitors known as the \"gepants,\" telcagepant and olcegepant, were previously investigated. In 2009, Merck withdrew the FDA application for telcagepant because of elevated liver enzymes and potential liver toxicity 196 Data as of May 1, 2020 AVD/AKS Page 2 of 17 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

The manufacturer of olcegepant also ceased pursuing FDA approval; however, the manufacturer did not explicitly state the rationale. It has been widely speculated that olcegepant development ceased due to limitations associated with administration as an intravenous (IV)-only product ( Edvinsson et al 2017, Walker et al 2013). No substantial issues with liver toxicity have been observed in trials with the currently marketed CGRP inhibitors. Additional CGRP inhibitors early in their development include vazeg epant, the first intranasally release 2019, Staines 2019). In April 2019, Teva announced that it would not pursue development of fremanezumab- vfrm for an episodic cluster headache indication due to results from the ENFORCE trial (Teva Pharmaceuticals press release 2019 ). Erenumab- aooe and eptinezumab -jjmr are not currently under clinical investigation for the indication of cluster headache (Clinicaltrials.gov 20 20).

CLINICAL EFFICACY SUMMARY Rimegepant ODT has been studied as acute therapy in approximately 1466 patients in 1 Phase 3 trial of episodic migraine (with or without aura) patients and in 1 unpublished long -term safety trial. Three additional trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of rimegepant 75 mg in an oral tablet formulation were considered supportive for approval; 2 trials 197 Data as of May 1, 2020 AVD/AKS Page 3 of 17 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Ubrogepant has been studied as acute therapy in approximately 3360 patients across 2 trials in patients with 2 to 8 migraines/month with moderate to severe pain intensity either with or without aura and in 1 unpublished, open -label extension (O LE) trial . Eptinezumab -jjmr has been studied in approximately 2019 patients across 2 trials in patients with episodic or chronic migraine subtypes for prevention, with data available in published formats. Erenumab -aooe has been studied as preventive therapy in approximately 2500 patients across 4 trials in patients with episodic or chronic migraine subtypes and 1 OLE trial, with data available in published and unpublished formats. Fremanezumab- vfrm has been studied as preventive therapy in approximately 2005 patients across 3 trials in patients with episodic or chronic migraine subtypes, with data available in published formats. In fremanezumab -vfrm trials, the definition of a headache or migraine day for the primary endpoint required a consecutive 2 hour (episodic) or 4 hour (chronic) duration of pain, compared to other CGRP inhibitor trials that required a duration of 30 minutes. Galcanezumab- gnlm has been studied as preventive therapy in approximately 2886 patients across 3 trials in patients with episodic or chronic migraine subtypes and 1 long -term safety trial with unpublished data to 1 year. The efficacy and safety of galcanezumab- gnlm was evaluated for treatment in one 8 -week study with 106 adults with episodic cluster headache (max imum of 8 at tacks/day). The definition of the primary and secondary endpoints differed in the prevention of episodic and chronic migraine trials. Additional differences included , but were not limited to, co-morbid conditions, concomitant medications, a requirement of stable doses of migraine prevention medication (if co- administered) for certain durations, and the definition s of headache, migraine headache, and migraine day. Some CGRP inhibitor trials allowed patients to receive concomitant preventive migraine medicat ion during treatment. Also, some chronic migraine trials allowed for the inclusion of patients with medication overuse headache. Prevention of e pisodic migraine Eptinezumab -jjmr PROMISE- 1 (PC), multi -center (MC) , Phase 3 trial in which adults with a history of episodic migraine were randomized to receive placebo (n = 222), eptinezumab -jjmr 100 mg (n = 221), or eptinezumab- jjmr 300 mg (n = 222) every 3 months for 12 months. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in MMD from baseline to week 12. Eptinezumab -jjmr 100 mg and 300 mg significantly redu ced MMDs across weeks 1 to 12 compared with placebo (placebo, 3.2; 100 mg, 3.9, p = 0.02; 300 mg, 4.3, p = 0.0001). The odds for a 50% reduc tion in MMD were approximately 1.7 to 2.2 times higher with eptinezumab- jjmr than placebo. Of note, the endpoints underwent a testing hierarchy and were not significant for 50% migraine responder rates in the 100 mg dose group ( Ashina et al 2020, Vyepti [dossier ] 2020). Erenumab -aooe The STRIVE trial was a 6 -month, DB, PC, MC, Phase 3 trial in which 955 patients with episodic migraine were randomized to placebo (n = 319), erenumab- aooe 70 mg (n = 317), or erenumab- aooe 140 mg (n = 319) once monthly . The primary endpoint was the change in mean MMD from baseline to months 4 to 6, which favored treatment with erenumabaooe 70 mg (mean change vs placebo, 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.9 to 0.9; p < 0.001) and erenumabaooe 140 mg (mean change vs placebo, 1.9; 95% CI, 2.3 to 1.4; p < 0.001). Erenumabaooe significantly increased the proportion of patients achieving 50% reduction in MMD (difference for 70 mg vs placebo, 16.7%; odds ratio [OR], 2.13; difference for 140 mg vs placebo, 23.4%; OR, 2.81) . Erenumabaooe was also associated with a significant decrease in the mean monthly acute migrainespecific medication treatment days (difference for 70 mg vs placebo, 0.9; difference for 140 mg vs placebo, 1.4) (Goadsby et al 2017 ). The ARISE tria l was a 12- week, DB, PC, MC, Phase 3 trial in which 577 patients with episodic migraine were randomized to placebo (n = 291) or erenumab -aooe 70 mg (n = 286) once monthly. The primary endpoint was the change in MMD from baseline to weeks 9 to 12, which fav ored treatment with erenumabaooe 70 mg (mean change vs placebo, 1.0; 95% CI, 1.6 to 0.5; p < 0.001). Compared to placebo, erenumabaooe significantly increased the proportion of patients achieving 50% reduction in MMD (difference, 10.2%; OR, 1.59). E renumabaooe was also associated with a significant decrease in the mean monthly acute migrainespecific medication treatment days (difference, 0.6) (Dodick et al 2018[a] ). 198 Data as of May 1, 2020 AVD/AKS Page 4 of 17 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

The LIBERTY trial was a 12- week, DB, PC, MC, Phase 3b trial in which 246 patients with episodic migraine who failed 2 to 4 prior preventive migraine treatments were randomized to placebo (n = 125) or erenumab -aooe 140 mg (n = 121) once monthly. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with 50% reduction in MMD from baseline to the last 4 weeks of DB treatment (weeks 9 to 12), which e renumabaooe significantly increased over placebo (difference, 16.6%; OR, 2.73; 95% CI, 1.43 to 5.19; p = 0.002). Compared to placebo, 5.9% more patients treated with erenumabaooe 140 mg reported a 100% reduction in MMD, or migraine cessation. Erenumab -aooe 140 mg/month compared with significantly the MMD (difference, 1.61; 95% CI, 2.70 to 0.52; p = 0.004). Erenumabaooe was also associated with a significant decrease in the mean monthly acute migrainespecific medication treatment days (difference, 1.73) (Reuter et al 2018). Fremanezumab- vfrm The HALO- EM trial was a 12 -week, DB, PC, MC, Phase 3 trial in which 875 patients with episodic migraine were randomized to placebo (n = 294), fremanezumab -vfrm 225 mg once monthly (n = 290), or fremanezumab- vfrm 675 mg once quarterly (n = 291). The primary endpoint was the change in mean MMD, which favored treatment with fremanezumab- vfrm 225 mg (mean change vs placebo, 1.5; 95% CI, 2.0 to 0.9; p < 0.001) and fremanezumab -vfrm 675 mg (mean change vs placebo, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.8 to 0.7; p < 0.001). Of note, HALO -EM was powered to detect a 1.6-day difference in the MMD between the fremanezumab -vfrm and placebo groups, but effect sizes resulted in a 1.5- day reduction for the fremanezumab -vfrm monthly dosing group and a 1.3- day reduction for the fremanezumab- vfrm quarterly dosing group. Although the threshold was not reached, a minimal clinically important difference has not bee n established for this particular outcome. Compared to placebo, greater MMD reductions were also observed in patients who were prescribed fremanezumab -vfrm 225 mg ( mean change vs placebo, 1.3) and 675 mg (mean change vs placebo, 1.1) as monotherapy. Fremanezumab -vfrm significantly increased the proportion of patients achieving 50% reduction in MMD (difference for 225 mg vs placebo, 19.8%; OR, 2.36; difference for 675 mg vs placebo, 16.5%; OR, 2.06) . Additionally, fremanezumab -vfrm was associated with a significant decrease in the mean monthly acute migrainespecific medication treatment days (difference for 225 mg vs placebo, 1.4; difference for 675 mg vs placebo, 1.3) (Dodick et al 2018[b] ). FOCUS was a DB, PC, Phase 3b trial that evaluated 838 patients with episodic (39%) or chronic migraine (61%) who had previously not responded to 2 to 4 classes of migraine preventive medications . Of the patients enrolled, approximately 40% were classified as having episodic migraines and randomized to fremanezumab -vfrm 225 mg administered monthly with no loading dose (n = 110/283), fremanezumab- vfrm 675 mg administered quarterly (n = 107/276), or placebo (n = 112/279) for 12 weeks. Failure was defined as no clinically meaningful improvement after at least 3 months of therapy at a stable dose, as per the treating physician's judgment, discontinuation because of adverse events that made treatment intolerable, or treatment contraindicated or unsuitable for the preventive treatment of migraine for the patient. At baseline, the MMD was approximately 14.2 days and the MMHD (of at least moderate severity) was 12.6 days . For the overall population, the MMD reduction over 12 weeks was 0.6 (standard error [SE], 0.3) days for placebo, 4.1 (SE, 0.34) days for the monthly fremanezumab-vfrm group (least squares mean difference [LSMD] vs placebo, -3.5; 95% CI, -4.2 to -2.8 days; p < 0.0001), and 3.7 (SE, 0.3) for days for the quarterly fremanezumab -vfrm group (LSMD vs placebo, days; p < 0.0001). For episodic migraine and compared to placebo, the LSMD in MMD reduction over 12 weeks was 3.1 days for both dose groups ( fremanezumab- vfrm monthly < 0.0001 for both). In the overall population, the proportion s of patients with a 50% response over 12 weeks were 34% in both the quarterly and monthly fremanezumab- vfrm groups vs 9% with placebo (p < 0.0001). Only the monthly fremanezumab- vfrm arm achieved a 75% sustained responder rate that was statistically different from placebo (OR, 8.6; 95% CI, 2.0 to 37.9; p = 0.0045). Adverse events were similar for placebo and fremanezumab-vfrm. Serious adverse events were reported in 4 (1%) of 277 patients with placebo, 4 (1%) of 285 with monthly fremanezumab- vfrm, and 2 (< 1%) of 276 with vfrm (Ferrari et al 2019 ). Galcanezumab- gnlm The EVOLVE -1 and EVOLVE -2 trials were 6 -month, DB, PC, MC, Phase 3 trials in 858 and 915 patients with episodic migraine, respectively. Patients were randomized to placebo (EVOLVE -1, n = 433; EVOLVE -2, n = 461), galcanezumab- gnlm 120 mg once monthly (EVOLV E-1, n = 213; EVOLVE -2, n = 231), or galcanezumab -gnlm 240 mg once monthly (EVOLVE- 1, n = 212; EVOLVE -2, n = 223). Patients in the galcanezumab- gnlm 120 mg group received a loading dose of 240 mg at the first injection only. The EVOLVE -1 trial included a North American population and the EVOLVE -2 trial included a global population. The primary endpoint was the change in mean monthly migraine headache days (MMHD) (Stauffer et al 2018, Skljarevski et al 2018). 199 Data as of May 1, 2020 AVD/AKS Page 5 of 17 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. In EVOLVE- 1, the primary endpoint outcome favored treatment with galcanezumab- gnlm 120 mg (mean change vs placebo, 1.9; 95% CI, 2.5 to 1.4; p < 0.001) and galcanezumab- gnlm 240 mg (mean change vs placebo, 1.8; 95% CI, 2.3 to 1.2; p < 0.001). Galcanezumab -gnlm significantly increased the proportion of patients achieving 50% reduction in MMHD (difference for 120 mg vs placebo, 23.7%; OR, 2. 64; difference for 240 mg vs placebo, 22.3%; OR, 2. 50). Compared to placebo, 9.4% more patients treated with galcanezumab -gnlm 120 mg and 9.4% more treated with galcanezumab -gnlm 240 mg reported a 100% reduction in MMHD, or migraine cessation. Galcanezumab- gnlm was also associated with a significant decrease in the mean monthly acute migrainespecific medication treatment days (difference fo r 120 mg vs placebo, 1.8; difference for 240 mg vs placebo, 1. 6) (Stauffer et al 2018). In EVOLVE- 2, the primary endpoint outcome favored treatment with galcanezumab- gnlm 120 mg (mean change vs placebo, 2.0; 95% CI, 2.6 to 1.5; p < 0.001) and galcanezumab- gnlm 240 mg (mean change vs placebo, 1.9; 95% CI, 2.4 to 1.4; p < 0.001). Galcanezumab -gnlm significantly increased the proportion of patients achieving 50% reduction in MMHD (difference for 120 mg vs placebo, 23.0%; OR, 2.54; difference for 240 mg vs placebo, 21.0%; OR, 2.34) . Compared to placebo, 5.8% more patients treated with galcanezumab -gnlm 120 mg and 8.1% more treated with galcanezumab -gnlm 240 mg reported migraine cessation. Galcanezumab -gnlm was also associated with a significant decrease in the mean monthly acute migrainespecific medication treatment days (difference for 120 mg vs placebo, 1.8; difference for 240 mg vs placebo, 1.7) (Skljarevski et al 2018 ). In an analysis of persistence for patients with episodic migraine, 41.5 and 41.1% of galcanezumab- gnlm -treated patients (120mg and 240mg, respectively) had a 50% response for 3 months, which was greater than placebo (21.4%; p<0.001). Approximately 6% of galcanezumab- gnlm -treated patients maintained response all 6 months 2% of placebo -treated patients. Few galcanezumab -gnlm -treated patients maintained 100% response for all 6 months (< 1.5%) (F\u00f6rderreuther et al 2018). Prevention of c hronic migrai ne Eptinezumab -jjmr The PROMISE- 2 trial was a 12- week, DB, PC, MC, Phase 3 trial in which 1121 patients with chronic migraine were randomized to placebo (n = 366), eptinezumab -jjmr 100 mg (n = 356), or eptinezumab -jjmr 300 mg (n = 350) once every 12 weeks (or quarterly). The primary endpoint was the change in mean MMD . Treatment with eptinezumab 100 and 300 mg was associated with significant reductions in MMDs across weeks 1 to 12 compared with placebo (placebo 5.6; 100 mg 7.7, p < 0.0001; 300mg 8.2, p < 0.0001 ). The odds for a 50% reduction in MMD were approximately 2.1 to 2.4 times higher with eptinezumab- jjmr than placebo ( Lipton et al 2020 ). Erenumab -aooe Erenumab -aooe was studied in a 12 week, DB, PC, MC, Phase 2 trial in which 667 patients with chronic migraine were randomized to placebo (n = 286), erenumab aooe 70 mg (n = 191), or erenumab aooe 140 mg (n = 190) once monthly. The primary endpoint was the change in MMD from baseline to weeks 9 to 12, which favored treatment with erenumab aooe 70 mg and erenumab aooe 140 mg (mean change for both doses vs placebo, 2.5; 95% CI, 3.5 to 1.4; p < 0.0001). Erenumab aooe significantly increased the proportion of patients achieving 50% reduction in MMD (difference for 70 mg vs placebo, 17% ; OR, 2.2; difference for 140 mg vs placebo, 18% ; OR, 2.3 ). Both erenumab aooe 70 mg (difference, 1.9) and erenumab aooe 140 mg (difference, 2.6) significantly reduced the mean acute migraine specific medication days; however, the higher 140 mg dose had a greater reduction numerically over placebo and reductions may be dose dependent (Tepper et al 2017). An analysis of patient reported outcomes found patients with chronic migraine had clinically relevant improvement s across a range of measures. Improvements were observed at month 3 for all endpoints regardless of erenumabaooe dose, and minimally important clinical differences were achieved for certain measures with the erenumabaooe 140 mg dose ( Lipton et al 2019[b] MC, Phase 3 trial, HALO -CM, in which 1130 patients with chronic migraine were randomized to placebo (n = 375), fremanezumab -vfrm 225 mg once monthly (n = 379), or fremanezumab- vfrm 675 mg once quarterly (n = 376). Patients in the fremanezumab- vfrm 225 mg group received a loading dose of 675 mg at the first injection only. The primary endpoint was the change in mean headache days (MHD), which favored treatment with fremanezumab- vfrm 225 mg (mean change vs placebo, 2.1; SE, \u00b1 0.3; p < 0.001) and fremanezumab- vfrm mg (mean change vs SE, \u00b1 0.3; p < 0.001). Fremanezumab -vfrm significantly increased the proportion of patients achieving 50% reduction in M HD (difference for 225 mg vs placebo, 22.7%; OR, 200 Data as of May 1, 2020 AVD/AKS Page 6 of 17 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Additionally, fremanezumab- vfrm was associated with a significant decrease in the mean monthly acute migrainespecific medication treatment days (difference for 225 mg vs placebo, 2.3; difference for 675 m g vs placebo, 1. 8) (Silberstein et al 2017). FOCUS was previously described as including 838 patients overall who had not responded to 2 to 4 classes of migraine preventive medications. Of the patients enrolled, 61% were diagnosed with chronic migraine and were randomized to fremanezumab- vfrm 675 mg administered quarterly (n = 169/276 ), a fremanezumab- vfrm 675 mg loading dose followed by 225 mg administered monthly (n = 173/283) , or placebo (n = 167 /279) . Among patients classified as having chronic migraine and compared to placebo, the LSMD in MMD reduction over 12 weeks was 3.8 days for the fremanezumab - vfrm monthly group and 3.2 days for in a 12-week, PC, MC, Phase 3 trial, REGAIN, in which 1113 patients with chronic migraine were randomized to placebo (n = 558), galcanezumab- gnlm 120 mg once monthly (n = 278), or galcanez umab -gnlm 240 mg once monthly (n = 277). Patients in the galcanezumab- gnlm 120 mg group received a loading dose of 240 mg at the first injection only. The primary endpoint was the change in MMHD, which favored treatment with galcanezumab- gnlm 120 mg (mean change vs placebo, 2.1; 95% CI, 2.9 to 1.3; p < 0.001) and galcanezumab- gnlm 240 mg (mean change vs placebo, 1.9; 95% CI, 2.7 to 1.1; p < 0.001). Galcanezumab- gnlm significantly increased the proportion of patients achieving 50% reduction in MMHD (difference for 120 mg vs placebo, 12.2%; OR, 2. 10; difference for 240 mg vs placebo, 12.1%; OR, 2. 10). Compared to placebo, 0.2% more patients treated with galcanezumab- gnlm 120 mg and 0.8% more treated with galcanezumab- gnlm 240 mg reported migraine cessation; this w as not statistically different for either dose group. Galcanezumab- gnlm was also associated with a significant decrease in the mean monthly acute migrainespecific medication treatment days (difference for 120 mg vs placebo, 2.5; difference for 240 mg vs placebo, 2.1) (Detke et al 2018). In an analysis of persistence for patients with chronic migraine, 29% of galcanezumab- gnlm -treated patients 3months compared to 16% of placebo- treated patients. A total of 16.8 and 14.6% of galcanezumab- gnlm -treated patients (120mg and 240mg, respectively) had a 50% response for 3 months, which was greater than placebo (6.3%; p<0.001). Few patients maintained 75% response (< 3%) (F\u00f6rderreuther et al 2018 ). Treatment of episodic cluster headache Galcanezumab- gnlm Galcanezumab- gnlm was evaluated in an 8- week, DB trial, in which 106 patients with episodic cluster headache were randomized to placebo (n = 57) or galcanezumab- gnlm 300 mg once monthly (n = 49). A total of 90 (85%) patients completed the DB phase. Patients were allowed to use certain specified acute/abortive cluster headache treatments, including triptans, oxygen, acetaminophen (APAP) , and NSAIDs during the study. At baseline, patients had a mean of 17.5 headache attacks/week, maximum of 8 attacks/day, minimum of 1 attack every other day, and at least 4 attacks during the prospective 7- day baseline period. For the primary endpoint, galcanezumab- gnlm significantly decreased the mean change from baseline in weekly cluster headache attack frequency during weeks 1 to 3 vs placebo ( -8.7 vs -5.2 attacks; p = 0.036). Galcanezumab -gnlm was also associated with a significantly greater proportion of responders ( 50% reduction in weekly cluster headache attack frequency) at week 3 (71.4 vs 52.6%; p = 0.046). Adverse events did not differ between groups, except for a significant increase in the incidence of injection- site pain with galcanezumab- gnlm treated patients (8 vs p = [NCT02397473] 2020 , Emgality prescribing information 2019, Goadsby et al 2019). Treatment of acute migraine (w ith or without aura) Rimegepant ODT Rimegepant ODT was evaluated in a Phase 3, DB, MC, PC, randomized controlled trial ( RCT) in 1466 patients (modified intention to treat, n = 1351) with migraine with or without aura.

Among patients randomized, 92.2% were included in the efficacy analysis and 93.8% in the safety analysis (Croop et al 2019, Nurtec ODT [dossier] 2020, Nurtec ODT prescribing information 2020). The percentage of patients achieving headache pain freedom and MBS freedom 2 hours after a single dose was statistically significantly greater in patients who received rimegepant ODT compared to those who received placebo. Pain-free at 2 hour s: 21.2% for rimegepant ODT 75 mg vs 10.9% for placebo (p < 0.0001) MBS- free at 2 hours : 35.1 % for rimegepant ODT 75 mg vs 26.8% for placebo (p = 0.0009 ) Out of the 21 secondary endpoints tested hierarchically, significant results were achieved for the first 19 endpoints. Those endpoints that were considered not significant included freedom from nausea at 2 hours post -dose, and pain relapse from 2 to 48 hours. The most common adverse events were nausea and urinary tract infection. No serious adverse events were reported. Three additional trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of rimegepant 75 mg in an oral tablet (non-ODT) formulation were considered supportive for approval. A MC, DB, dose -ranging trial using an adaptive design was conducted to determine an effective and tolerable dose range of rimegepant for the acute treatment of migraine. A total of 885 adults with migraine with or without aura were randomized to 1 of 6 rimegepant dose groups (10, 25, 75, 150, 300, or 600 mg), sumatriptan 100 mg, or placebo. It was found that the proportion of patients who were pain-free 2 hours after receiving a single dose of rimegepant 75 mg oral tablet was significantly higher compared with placebo (31.4% [n = 27/86] vs 15.3% [n = 31/203]; p = 0.002). The most common adverse events were nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. No treatment -related serious AEs were reported ( Marcus et al 2014). A MC, DB, PC, Phase 3 trial (n = 1072 in efficacy analysis) evaluating rimegepant vs placebo for acute migraine treatment fo und that the proportion of patients who were pain -free 2 hours after receiving a single dose of rimegepant 75 mg oral tablet was significantly higher compared with placebo (19.6 vs 12.0%; absolute difference, 7.6%; 95% CI, 3.3 to 11.9; p < 0.001). In addition, the proportion of patients who were free from their MBS 2 hours post -dose was significantly higher with rimegepant 75 mg oral tablet compared with placebo (37.6 vs 25.2%; absolute difference, 12.4%; 95% CI, 6.9 to 17.9; p < 0.001). Nausea and urinary tract infection were the only AEs reported in > 1% of the patients in the rimegepant and placebo groups . A serious adverse event associated with rimegepant was back pain (n = 1) ( Lipton et al 2019[c] , Nurtec ODT [dossier] 2020 ). A MC, DB, PC, Phase 3 trial (n = 1084 in efficacy analysis) evaluating rimegepant vs placebo for acute migraine treatment found that the proportion of patients who were pain -free 2 hours after receiving a single dose of rimegepant 75 mg oral tablet was significantly higher compared with placebo (19.2 vs 14.2%; p = 0.03). In addition, the proportion of patients who were free from their MBS 2 hours post -dose was significantly higher with rimegepant 75 mg oral tablet compared with placebo (36.6 vs 27.7%; p = 0.002). Nausea and dizziness were the most common adverse event s reported in the rimegepant and placebo treatment groups, respectively. Serious adverse event s were reported in 2 patients treated with rimegepant and 1 patient treated with placebo ( Lipton et al 2018 [poster] , Nurtec ODT [dossier] 2020 ). Ubrogepant Ubrogepant was evaluated in 2 Phase 3, PC, DB trials (ACHIEVE I and II) , in which 3358 patients (ACHIEVE I, n = 1672; ACHIEVE II, n =1686) were randomized to take 1 dose of placebo (n = 1122), ubrogepant 50 mg (n = 1118), or ubrogepant 100 mg (n = 557) (100 mg was evaluated in the ACHIEVE I trial only , and a 25 mg group was included in the ACHIEVE II trial only [n = 561]) . Patients had 2 to 8 migraines/month with moderate to severe pain i ntensity in the past 3 months either with or without aura and had a history of migraine for 1 year . A second dose of study treatment (placebo or ubrogepant), or the patient's usual acute treatment for migraine, was allowed between 2 to 48 hours after the initial treatment for a non- responding or recurrent migraine headache. At baseline, 23% of patients were taking preventive medications for migraine, and approximately 23 to 27% were insufficient triptan responders . In ACHIEVE I, 79% were included in the efficacy analysis and 86% in the safety analysis, and in ACHIEVE II, 91.7% had a qualifying migraine event and 88% were included in the analysis ( Dodick et al 2019, Lipton et al 2019[a] , Ubrelvy prescribing information 2019). Compared to placebo, significant improvement s were demonstrated for the co- primary endpoints of pain freedom and the MBS freedom at 2 hours post -dose in the ubrogepant arms. MBS was a collection of selective, self -identified symptoms (ie, photophobia, phonophobia, or nausea). The following differences from placebo were demonstrated: 202 Data as of May 1, 2020 AVD/AKS Page 8 of 17 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Pain-free at 2 hours : 7.4% (p = 0.002) and 7.5% (p = 0.007) for the ubrogepant 50 mg dose in ACHIEVE I and II trials, respectively, and 9.4% (p < 0.001) for ubrogepant 100 mg dose in ACHIEVE I trial. MBS- free at 2 hours : 10.8% and 11.5% (p < 0.001 for both) for the ubrogepant 50 mg dose in ACHIEVE I and II trials, respectively, and 9.9% (p < 0.001) for ubrogepant 100 mg dose in ACHIEVE I trial . The incidence of photo- and phonophobia was reduced following administration. Significantly more patients main tained pain freedom for 2 to 24 hours post -dose in the ubrogepant 100 mg arm (difference from placebo, 6.8%; p = 0.002) and the 50 mg arm for ACHIEVE II only (6.2%; p = 0.005). In ACHIEVE I, the most common adverse events included nausea (1.5 to 4.7%), somnolence (0.6 to 2.5%), and dry mouth (0.6 to 2.1%). In ACHIEVE II, the most common adverse events within 48 hours were nausea ( 2.5% for all arms) and dizziness ( 2.1% for all arms). No serious adverse events or adverse events leading to discontinuation were reported 48 hours after the initial dose. In ACHIEVE II, the serious adverse events at 30 days included appendicitis, spontaneous abortion, pericardial effusion, and seizure. Open -label extensions (OLE) and long -term safety studies One published OLE with data to 1 year and 1 unpublished abstract with data to 3 years evaluated erenumab- aooe 70 mg (protocol amended to include 140 mg doses) in patients with episodic migraine. Of 472 patients in the parent study, 308 patients completed 1 year of open -label (OL) treatment. For the 3 year assessment, of the 383 patients enrolled in the OLE, 250 continued into the 140 mg once monthly dosing. At the time of interim analysis, 236 patients remained in the OLE ( Amgen [data on file] 2018, Ashina et al 2017, Ashina et al 2018 ). There may be greater improvements with sustained therapy based on a 1- year OLE interim analysis of episodic migraine patients t reated with erenumab- aooe 70 mg once monthly. Patients had a mean value of 8.8 MMDs at parent study baseline. After 3 months of treatment in the parent study, the number of MMDs was reduced to 6.3 days (mean change of 2.5 days). After a total of 16 months of treatment, the number of MMDs was reduced to 3.7 days (mean change of 5.1 days). After 64 weeks, 65% (n = 184) of episodic migraine patients achieved a 50% reduction in MMD s and 26% (n = 73) had achieved a migraine-free status . The most frequently reported adverse events ( 4.0 per 100 patient -years) were viral upper respiratory tract infection, upper respiratory tract infection, sinusitis, influenza, and back pain. One unpublished OLE evaluated erenumab- aooe 70 mg (protocol amended to include 140 mg doses) with data to 1 year in patients with chronic migraine. A total of 609 patients with chronic migraine enrolled in the OLE. A total of 199 increased their dose from 70 mg to 140 mg by week 28 (Amgen [data on file] 2018, Tepper et al 2018) . Patients with chronic migraine had a mean value of 18.8 MMDs at parent study baseline. After a total of 1 year of treatment, the number of MMDs was reduced to 8.5 in the erenumab-aooe 70 mg group and 10.5 in the erenumab- aooe 140 mg group. After 1 year of erenumab -aooe 70 mg and 140 mg monthly dosing, a total of 53% and 67% of chronic migraine patients achieved a 50% reduction in MMDs and 6% and 13% had achieved a migraine-free status, re spectively . The most frequently reported adverse events ( 2.0 per 100 patient -years) were viral upper respiratory tract infection, upper respiratory tract infection, sinusitis, and arthralgia. Another unpublished safety study, the CGAJ study, evaluated galcanezumab- gnlm 120 mg (plus 240 mg loading dose) and 240 mg monthly dosing to 1 year in patients with episodic or chronic migraine. At baseline, 80.7% of patients in the galcanezumab- gnlm 120 mg arm and 77.0% in the galcanezumab -gnlm 240 mg arm had episodic migraine. A total of 270 patients who had a history of 4 MMHDs and 1 headache- free day/month for the past 3 months continued galcanezumab- gnlm treatment (Eli Lilly and Company [data on file] 2018, Emgality [dossier] 2018, Stauffer et al 2017) . At baseline, patients had a mean value of 9.7 to 11.4 (standard deviation [SD], 6.0 to 6.6) MMHDs. After a total of 1 year of treatment, the number of MMHDs was reduced to 5.6 days in the galcanezumab -gnlm 120 mg group and 6.5 days in the galcanezumab -gnlm 24 0 mg group. After 12 consecutive months of treatment, 24.2% of patients treated with galcanezumab -gnlm 120 mg and 34.8% of patients treated with galcanezumab-gnlm 240 mg maintained response. The most frequently reported adverse events (incidence 15.0%) were injection site pain, nasopharyngitis, and upper respiratory tract infections. One patient discontinued due to suicidal ideation in the galcanezumab- gnlm 120mg group. There were no overall concerns regarding safety or tolerability. The long -term safety of ubrogepant was evaluated in 813 patients with intermittent dosing administered for up to 1 year in an OLE. Of the 813 patients, 421 patients were exposed to ubrogepant 50 mg or 100 mg for 6 months, and 364 patients were exposed for 1 year. All patients were treated for 2 migraine attacks/month, on average. In the OLE, 2.5% of patients withdrew from ubrogepant treatment because of an adverse reaction. The most common adverse 203 Data as of May 1, 2020 AVD/AKS Page 9 of 17 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Rimegepant 75 mg was evaluated in an unpublished interim analysis of a long -term safety study which evaluated 1784 patients for up to 52 weeks. The most frequently reported adverse event s were upper respiratory tract infection (8.5%) and nasopharyngitis (6.4%). There were no deaths, and the rates of serious adverse events and adverse events leading to discontinuation of rimegepant were low (2.5% and 2.7%, respectively). No clinically relevant trends in laboratory abnormalities were observed on- treatment or during follow up ( Nurtec ODT dossier 2020 ). Caution should be exercised in applying results from extension trials. The OL design may contribute to biased reports. Extension trials may have biased outcomes because those experiencing benefit are included in extension trials; results are useful for reporting trends in treatment. Additionally, there is no comparator to account for placebo effects. CLINICAL GUIDELINES Acute treatment of migraine The American Headache Society (AHS) published updated consensus statement guidelines for migraine in 2018. The AHS recommends the use of APAP, NSAIDs , non -opioid analgesics, or caffeinated analgesic combinations mild or moderate attacks. The triptans or dihydroergotamine (DHE) are recommended for moderate or severe attacks as well as for mild attacks that respond poorly to other analgesics. These guidelines do not differentiate the triptans, but recommend that non- oral routes be used when sever e nausea or vomiting is present. Overall, the AHS designated the following drugs as having efficacy (AHS 2019): Established efficacy: (butorphanol, although use is not recommended) Combination medications Probably effective Ergotamine or other forms of rimegepant and ubrogepant may have a role in patients who have contraindications to the use of triptans or who have failed to respond to or tolerate 2 oral triptans, as determined by either a validated acute treatment patient reported outcome questionnaire or healthcare provider attestation. Coverage should be pr ovided until 2 attacks are treated to determine efficacy and tolerability. Other agents have had more established efficacy and safety relative to the newly FDA -approved migraine agents. There are a number of older guidelines/treatment recommendations for the treatment of migraine but, similar to the 2018 guidelines, they do not state a preference for a particular triptan or therapy (Evers et al 2009, Francis et al 2010, Marmura et al 2015, Silberstein 2000, Silberstein et al 2012 [guideline reaffirmed in 2015] ). In 2019, the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) and the AHS published a guideline on the acute treatment of migraine in children and adolescents. The guideline states that there is evidence to support the efficacy of ibuprofen, APAP (in children and adolescents), and triptans (mainly in adolescents) for migraine relief, although confidence in the evidence varies between agents ( Oskoui et al 2019[a] ). Of note, the CGRP inhibitors have not been adequately studied in children or adolescent s and are not currently FDA - approved for use in these populations . Prevention of migraine According to the AAN/AHS e vidence based guideline update on the pharmacologic treatment for episodic migraine prevention in adults , the following medications are effective preventive treatment options (see Appendix A for a definition of classifications) (Silberstein et al 2012 ): Level A (established efficacy and > 2 Class I trials): Antiepileptic drugs : divalproex sodium, sodium valproate, and topiramate 204 Data as of May 1, 2020 AVD/AKS Page 10 of 17 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Patients should always seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health provider with any questions regarding a medical condition. Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. Beta blockers : metoprolol, propranolol, and timolol Triptans (for [MRM]): or short term prophylaxis, frovatriptan Level B (probably effecti ve and 1 Class I or 2 Class II trials): Antidepressants: amitriptyline term prophylaxis, naratriptan and zolmitriptan Level C (possibly effective and 1 II trial): Angiotensin converting enzyme AAN recommends onabotulinumtoxin A as an effective treatment option that should be offered for chronic migraine. However, onabotulinumtoxin A is considered ineffective for the treatment of episodic migraines and should not be offered. There is insufficient evidence to compare the effectiveness of botulinum neurotoxin A with that of oral prophylactic topiramate (Simpson et al 2016) . In 2019, the AAN/AHS published a guideline on the preventive treatment of migraine in pediatric patients. The guideline states that the majority of preventive medications for pediatric migraine fail to demonstrate superiority to placebo. The guidelines make the following statements and recommendations for initial therapy (see Appendix B for a definition of classifications) (Oskoui et al 2019[ b]): It is possible that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) alone is effective in migraine prevention. There is insufficient evidence to evaluate the effects of flunarizine, nimodipine, valproate, and onabotulinumtoxinA for use in migraine prevention in children and adolescents. Acknowledging the limitations of currently available evidence, use of short -term treatment trials (a minimum of 2 months) may be warranted in those who could benefit from preventive treatment (Level B) . Consider amitriptyline combined with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) (inform of the potential adverse events, including risk of suicide) (Level B). Consider topiramate (Level B). I nform of side effects including decreased efficacy when combined with oral contraceptives and the teratogenic effect in patients of childbearing potential (Level A ). In patients of childbearing potential, daily folic acid is recommended (Level A). Consider propranolol (Level B ). Of note, the CGRP inhibitors have not been adequately studied in children or adolescent s and are not currently FDA- approved for use in these populations . Cluster headache According to the AHS evidence -based guidelines for the treatment of cluster head ache , there are a number of effective treatment options (AAN classifications were used for grading; see Appendix A for definitions) (Robbins et al 2016 ). For acute therapy of cluster headache, the following therapy options have positive evidence: Level A (established efficacy and 2 Class I trials): Certain triptans: sumatriptan subcutaneous and zolmitriptan nasal spray Oxygen Level B (probably effective and 1 Class I or 2 Class II trials): Certain triptans: sumatriptan nasal spray and zolmitriptan oral Sphenopalatine ganglion stimulation Level C (possibly effective and 1 Class II trial): Cocaine/lidocaine nasal spray Octreotide subcutaneous For preventive therapy of cluster headache, the following therapy options have positive evidence: Level A (established efficacy and 2 Class I trials): Suboccipital steroid injection Level B (probably effective and 1 Class I or 2 Class II trials): Civamide nasal spray (not marketed in the US) 205 Data as of May 1, 2020 AVD/AKS Page 11 of 17 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Level C (possibly effective and 1 Class II t rial): Lithium Verapamil Warfarin Melatonin SAFETY SUMMARY Ubrogepant is patients with serious hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the excipients. Mild to moderate hypersensitivity reactions ( eg, rash, dyspnea, pruritus, urticaria) were reported in trials. Cases of anaphylaxis and angioedema h ave been reported post -marketing. Delayed serious hypersensitivity has occurred with rimegepant. In cases of serious or severe reactions, treatment should be discontinued. Warnings and precautions associated with the CGRP inhibitors include hypersensitivit y reactions. Erenumab -aooe has additional warning s and precaution s associated with the following: Constipation with serious complications: Constipation with serious complications has been reported post-marketing. Some cases have required hospitalization, including surgery. Constipation was a common adverse event reported in up to 3% of patients. Concurrent use of medication associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility may increase the risk for severe constipation. Hypertension: Post -marketing reports of the development or worsening of hypertension have emerged. Some cases required pharmacological treatment to manage or , in other cases, hospitalization. Incidences of hypertension were most frequently reported within 7 days of treatment, and most cases were reported after the first dose. The CGRP inhibitors generally have a similar incidence of adverse event s as placebo. Very few severe adverse event s and treatment discontinuations due to adverse event s were reported. Across studies, adverse event s were generally mild and/or similar to placebo. The most common adverse events observed in studies of injectable CGRP inhibitors included injection site reactions (subcutaneous the oral CGRP inhibitors, ubrogepant was associated with somnolence, and both ubrogepant and rimegepant were associated with nausea. CGRP is a vasodilator and is found at higher concentrations during a migraine attack. In the 1- year interim analysis of an OLE study with erenumab- aooe, 2 patients had severe adverse events (a fatal arteriosclerosis event and a myocardial ischemia event confounded by sumatriptan administration) . No additional concerns were rai sed wi thin the OLE at 3 years, including any CV events . In a long- term safety study of patients treated with galcanezumab-gnlm for 1 year, 1 patient discontinued due to suicidal ideation in the galcanezumab- gnlm 120mg group. In a safety study of eptinezumab-jjmr in which 90.2% of patients were exposed to the drug for 6 months and 47.7% were exposed for 12 months, the most common adverse events observed were nasopharyngitis and hypersensitivity. A total of 9 patients reported serious adverse events with ubrogepant 50 mg (sinus tachycardia, intestinal obstruction, gait disturbance, cholelithiasis, acute cholecystitis, allergy, pneumonia, pelvic inflammatory disease, post -procedure infection, hypertensive crisis, and a substance- induced mood disorder) and 12 with ubrogepant 100 mg (colitis, hiatus hernia, acute pancreatitis, non- cardiac ectopic pregnancy, suicidal ideation, and acute respiratory failure ); however, not all events may be related to treatment. In an interim analysis of an OL, 52- week safety study of rimegepant, the most frequently reported adverse events were upper respiratory tract infection and nasopharyngitis. There were no deaths, and the rates of serious adverse events and adverse events leading to discontinuation of rimegepant were low. The long- term implications of prolonged CGRP inhibition are not fully established and safety has not been fully characterized (Amgen [data on file] 2018, Ashina et al 2017, Ashina et al 2018, Clinicaltri als.gov [NCT02873221] 2020, Eli and Company [data on file] 2018, Nurtec ODT [dossier] 2020, Stauffer et al 2017, Tepper et al 2018, Vyepti prescribing information 2020 ). There are no adequate data on the risks associated in patients who are pregnant or nursing, or in adolescent or pediatric populations. DOSING AND ADMINISTRATION Table 3 .

CONCLUSION Migraine is a common, recurrent, incapacitating disorder characterized by moderate to severe headaches and disabling features, including nausea, vomiting, neurologic symptoms, photophobia, and phonophobia. Migraines have a spectrum of frequency and severity that can significantly affect the quality of life of patients . Cluster headache is less prevalent than migraine and characterized by attacks of severe, unilateral pain with ipsilateral autonomic symptoms, which occur every other day to multiple times daily during a cluster period. Cluster headache is more likely to occur in men, whereas migraines are more likely to occur in women. Rimegepant and ubrogepant are oral CGRP inhibitors indicated for acute treatment of migraine with or without aura. prevention of migraine. Galcanezumab- gnlm has an additional indication for the treatment of episodic cluster headache. No CGRP inhibitor is FDA -approved for use in patients aged < 18 years. Eptinezumab -jjmr is the only IV formulation and requires administration in a healthcare setting. Guidelines divide treatment recommendations according to age, prevention or treatment, and migraine type: Current evidence based prophylactic migraine treatment options and guidance are limited for chronic migraine, and oral prophylactic medications prescribed for episodic migraine are often used for the preventive treatment of chronic migraine. Prophylactic migraine treatment options include oral agents (mainly anti seizure agents, antidepr essants, and beta blockers), injectable agents (onabotulinumtoxin A for chronic subtypes only), or neuromodulation devices for migraine or headache attacks. Certain oral therapies may not be appropriate for individual patients due to intolerability or eventual lack of efficacy. There is no optimal prophylactic migraine therapy and head-to -head trials are lacking. the treatment of cluster headache, subcutaneous sumatriptan, zolmitriptan nasal spray, and oxygen have the most positive evidence for acute therapy according to the AHS guidelines. To date, only subcutaneous sumatriptan is FDA- approved for the acute treatment of cluster headache. Additionally, sumatriptan nasal spray, zolmitriptan oral formulations, and sphenopalatine ganglion stimulation are probably effective for acute treatment per guidelines . For prevention of cluster headaches, suboccipital steroid injections are most effective according to the guidelines; however, there is no preventive medication currently FDA -approved for cluster headache. 208 Data as of May 1, 2020 AVD/AKS Page 14 of 17 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

For acute treatment of migraine in adults, guidelines generally recommend the use of APAP, NSAIDs, non -opioid analgesics, or caffeinated analgesic combinations for mild or moderate attacks. The triptans or DHE are recommended for moderate or severe attacks as well as for mild attacks that respond poorly to other analgesics. Recent AHS guidelines state that rimegepant and ubrogepant may have a role in patients who have contraindications to the use of triptans or who have failed to respond to or tolerate 2 oral triptans. There are no head -to-head studies with the CGRP inhibitors and no agent is clearly superior to others. Evidence for the CGRP inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy for the respective indications: Like other preventive medications for migraine, the CGRP inhibitors are not likely to render patients migraine -free. Based on 3 to 6 month data, primary endpoint reductions are similar to many oral prophylactic therapies; however, comparisons are limited as endpoints have been inconsistently defined. There are limited analyses and trials examining efficacy in patients who failed 2 prior preventive therapies; however, available data suggest that these patients may achieve greater reductions in migraine/headache frequency. Further researc h is warranted. Compared to placebo, the CGRP inhibitors when prescribed for prophylactic migraine therapy consistently demonstrated modest but statistically significant reductions in primary endpoint measures (eg, MMD , MMH, or MMHD) ranging from 0.7 to 3.5 days after 3 to 6 months of treatment . Overall, the odds for a 50% reduction in MM(H )D were approximately 1.6 to 5.8 times higher with the CGRP inhibitors than placebo with numbers -needed to treat (NNTs) ranging from 3 to 10. For the treatment of cluster headaches, galcanezumab- gnlm demonstrated efficacy compared to placebo in an 8- week trial, which allowed for acute/abortive treatments during therapy. Galcanezumab -gnlm significantly decreased the mean change from baseline in weekly cluster headache attack frequency by 3.5 during weeks 1 to 3 vs placebo. Additionally, 18.8% more patients were classified as responders ( 50% reduction in weekly cluster headache attack frequency) with galcanezumab- gnlm at week 3 vs placebo (p = 0.046). Ubrogepant and rimegepant are oral CGRP inhibitors FDA -approved for acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults. One differing characteristic is that ubrogepant allow s for a second dose within 24 hours whereas rimegepant does not. Rimegepant ODT demonstrated efficacy compared to placebo in a Phase 3, DB, RCT which evaluated acute response to migraine treatment after 2 hours. Patients were not allowed a second dose of study treatment (placebo or rimegepant). Rescue medications allowed 2 hours post -dose included aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen (or any other type mg/day, antiemetics (eg, metoclopramide or promethazine), or baclofen. Compared to placebo, significantly more patients treated with rimegepant 75 mg were pain -free at 2 hours (difference vs placebo, 10.3%). For the co- primary endpoint of MBS, significantly more rimegepant -treated patients reported being MBS -free at 2 hours post -dose (difference vs placebo, 8.3% ). Three additional trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of rimegepant 75 mg in an oral tablet formulation were considered supportive for approval. Ubrogepant demonstrated efficacy compared to placebo in 2 DB, RCTs, which reported acute response to migraine treatment after 2 hours. A second dose of study treatment (placebo or ubrogepant), or the patient's usual acute treatment for migraine, was allowed between 2 to 48 hours after the initial treatment for a non- responding or recurrent migraine headache. Compared to placebo, significantly more patients treated with ubrogepant were pain-free at 2 hours when administered the 50 mg (difference vs placebo, 7.4 to 7.5%) or 100 mg (difference vs placebo, 9.4%) dose. For the co- primary endpoint of MBS, significantly more ubrogepant -treated patients reported being MBS-f ree at 2 hours post dose for the 50 mg (difference vs placebo, 10.8 to 11.5%) and 100 mg (difference vs placebo, 9.9%) dose. Lack of information during pregnancy and breastfeeding is a consideration as many migraine patients are women of childbearing potential. The unknown risks of monoclonal antibodies and the effects on certain conditions are not fully characterized. Furthermore, rimegepant and ubrogepant have a number of drug interactions, and may not be appropriate with other medications. Important co -morbid populations were excluded from trials (eg, anxiety, depression, hypertension, and fibromyalgia), which also limits the generalizability to broader groups. There are no data in adolescents and children. The safety profiles of the subcutaneous CGRP inhibitors are generally mild with the most common adverse event s observed being injection site reactions. H ypersensitivity and nasopharyngitis were the most commonly reported adverse event s for the IV- administered agent, eptinezumab -jjmr. Mild to moderate hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, pruritus, drug hypersensitivity, and urticaria, were reported with all CGRP inhibitors. Post-marketing reports with erenumab- aooe have included hypertension and constipation with serious complications ; some cases of constipation have required hospitalization and surgery. The oral CGRP inhibitors, ubrogepant and rimegepant, were associated with nausea; ubrogepant was additionally associated with somnolence. 209 Data as of May 1, 2020 AVD/AKS Page 15 of 17 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Overall, ubrogepant and rimegepant are alternatives to triptans and/or DHE in patients who are unable to tolerate or have an inadequate response or contraindication to established pharmacologic abortive migraine treatments. The injectable CGRP inhibitors represent another therapy option in the prevention of episodic or chronic migraine. Eptinezumab -jjmr and fremanezumab- vfrm are the only agent s in the class that may be administered quarterly, which may fulfill a niche in patients who are non- adherent with treatment. Galcanezumab- gnlm is the only CGRP inhibitor indicated for the treatment of episodic cluster headaches. Dosage and administration vary by product and indication. Further long -term study is warranted. APPENDI CES Appendix A.

Therapeutic Class Overview Ophthalmic Immunomodulators INTRODUCTION Dry eye syndrome refers to a group of disorders of the tear film that are due to reduced tear production or excessive tear evaporation ( American Academy of Ophthalmology [AAO] 2018, Shtein 2020). The condition can be associated with discomfort and/or visual symptoms and may result in disease of the ocular surface. The ocular surface and tear - secreting g lands are recognized to be responsible for the maintenance of tear production and to clear tears. Therefore, disease or dysfunction results in an unstable and poorly maintained tear film that causes ocular irritation symptoms and an epithelial disease known as keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS). Decreased tear secretion and clearance initiates an inflammatory response on the ocular surface, which plays a role in the pathogenesis of KCS. Symptoms of KCS include, but are not limited to, dryness, discomfort, irritation/pain, foreign body sensation, and blurred vision ( AAO 201 8). Rare complications of severe dry eyes include ocular surface keratinization; corneal scarring, thinning, or neovascularization; microbial or sterile corneal ulceration with possible perforation; and severe visual loss. Frequent instillation of ophthalmic medications (eg, natural tears ) may cause dry eye symptoms by preventing the normal maintenance of the tear film. Other factors known to exacerbate symptoms of dry eye include environmental factors such as reduced humidity, air drafts, air conditioning, or heating. Associated systemic diseases include Sj\u00f6gren's Syndrome, rosacea, and viral infection. Common drug- induced causes of dry eye symptoms include systemic medications such as anticholinergics, Integrin Antagonists Tab le 1.

CLINICAL EFFICACY SUMMARY The ophthalmic immunomodulator products have not been directly compared in clinical trials and have primarily been compared to vehicle. The pivotal trials for cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion were 2 randomized, placebo- controlled trials that included 877 patients and an open- label, extension trial that included 412 patients ( Barber et al 2005, Sall et al 2000). All patients were diagnosed with moderate- to-severe KCS and decreased tear production based on the Schirmer tear test. The combined results of the 2 placebo- controlled trials demonstrated that cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion 0.05% and 0.1% were associated with significant improvements from baseline in corneal staining, Schirmer tear test scores, Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) scores, Subjective Facial Expression Rating Scale scores, and various dry eye related symptoms ( Sall et al 2000). Specifically compared to placebo, at 4 months, improvements i n corneal staining were significant in bot h cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion groups compared to placebo (p 0.044), and at 6 months, only the cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion 0.05% group demonstrated significance over placebo (p = 0.008). Additionally, at 6 months, improvements in Schirmer tear test scores were significantly greater for both cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion groups compared to placebo (p 0.05 for both) and from baseline scores (p values not reported). Improvements in OSDI and Subjective Facial Expression Rating Scale scores were significant compared to baseline for all treatment groups (p < 0.001), but there were no significant differences among these groups (p values not reported). Improvements in blurred vision were significantly greater in the cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion 0.05% group than placebo at all follow -up visits (p 0.014), and significant improvements were achieved at all time points within all treatment groups when compared to baseline for relief of dry eye symptoms including dryness (p < 0.001), sandy/gritty feeling (p < 0.001), and itching (p 0.038). A Chinese, double-blind study used similar subjective ratings for dry eye symptoms and found that cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion 0.05% improved measures over 8 weeks ( Chen et al 2010). An open -label, extension tr ial was also conducted to determine the long- term safety of cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion. After 3 consecutive 12 -month periods, results demonstrated that cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion was safe and well tolerated. Over 3 years, adverse events (AEs) were found in 65.3% (269/412) of patients with ocular burning reported most commonly (12.1%). This trial also demonstrated sustained efficacy of cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion over an extended period of time ( Barber et al 2005). A trial comparing cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion to punctal plugs or a combination of both demonstrated that both treatments improved the symptoms of dry eye, but punctal plugs achieved results more rapidly than cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion ( Roberts et al 2007). A systematic review of 18 randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ) examined the efficacy and safety of topical cyclosporine for treatment of DED . All cyclosporine formulations proved safe for the treatment of DED . Symptoms improved in 100% (9/9 RCTs), tear function improved 72% (9/17 RCTs) (Saccheti et al 2014). Statistical comparison of cyclosporine efficacy through a meta-analysis of data was not possible due to a lack of standardized criteria and comparable outcomes among studies. A systematic review/meta -analysis of 30 randomized, controlled clinical studies (N = 4009) assessed the effectiveness and safety of topical cyclosporine in the treatment of DED . Eighteen studies compared cyclosporine 0.05% plus artificial tears (AT) vs AT alone. However, due to incomplete results data or considerable statistical heterogeneity, only a meta - analysis on mean conjunctival goblet cell density was conducted. The mean density (MD) was greater in the cyclosporine treated group (MD 22.5 cells per unit, 95% Confidence Interval [CI], 16.3 to 28.8). Additionally, the analysis could not demonstrate the benefit of cyclosporine for tear production and helping to reduce signs and symptoms of dry eye. The remaining 12 studies were not assessed due to inconsistent data reporting ( de Paiva et al 2019). Two multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical studies evaluated the efficacy of cyclosporine ophthalmic solution 0.09% in 1 048 patients with KCS. In both studies, there was a significantly (p < 0.01) higher percentage of eyes with increases of 10 mm from baseline in Schirmer wetting as compared to vehicle at day 84. This effect was seen in approximately 17% of patients treated with cyclosporine ophthalmic solution vs approximately 9% of patients treated with vehicle (Cequa prescribing information 2018, Goldberg et al 2019, Luchs et al 2018, Sheppard et al 2020, Tauber et al 2018 ). The safety and efficacy of lifitegrast ophthalmic solution for the treatment of DED were assessed in a total of 1181 patients (1067 of which received lifitegrast 5%) in four week, randomized, multicenter, double- masked, vehicle- controlled studies (Semba et al 2012, Sheppard et al 2014, Tauber et al 2015, Holland et al 2017). The use of AT was not allowed during the studies. The clinical trials evaluated various endpoints related to signs and symptoms of DED. However, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval relied on an assessment of symptoms based on change 214 Data as of August 11, 2020 RLP/KMR Page 3 of 6 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

A larger reduction in EDS favoring lifitegrast was observed in all studies at day 42 and day 84. EDS was used as a primary symptom endpoint in 2 of the 4 studies (OPUS -2 and OPUS -3); the other 2 evaluated EDS as a secondary endpoint. In OPUS- 1, the primary symptom endpoint was the visual -related function subscale score of the Ocular Surface Disease Index (VR -OSDI) questionnaire. No difference between lifitegrast and placebo was seen in the mean change from baseline to day 84 (p = 0.7894) ( Sheppard et al 2014 ). At day 84, a larger reduction in ICSS favoring lifitegrast was observed in 3 of the 4 studies (no statistically significant difference between lifitegrast and placebo was found in the OPUS -2 study). In a 1-year safety study (N = 331: 220 lifitegrast; 111 placebo), there were no serious ocular treatment -emergent AEs. Overall, 53.6% of participants receiving lifitegrast experienced 1 ocular treatment -emergent AE vs 34.2% in the placebo group; most treatment -emergent AEs were mild to moderate in severity, with burning, instillation site reaction, reduced visual acuity, dry eye, and dysgeusia reported most commonly ( Donnenfeld et al 2016). Ocular comfort of lifitegrast was also assessed in OPUS -3 (N = 711). Drop comfort scores (0 = very comfortable, 10 = very uncomfortable) were assessed immediately after instillation and at 1, 2, and 3 minutes post -instillation. The results showed that drop comfort scores with lifitegrast improved wit hin 3 minutes of instillation with scores approaching that of placebo (Nichol s et al 2018 ). A pooled analysis of 5 randomized trials (lifitegrast N = 1287, placebo N = 1177) evaluated the safety and tolerability of lifitegrast ophthalmic solution 5.0% for the treatment of dry eye. Overall, the majority of treatment related adverse events reported (> 5%) were: instillation site irritation, instillation site reaction and instillation site pain; the most common non- ocular adverse event reported was dysgeusia in 14.5% of patients receiving lifitegra st vs 0.3% in the placebo group. The analysis also noted that drop comfort scores in the lifitegrast treatment group improved within 3 minutes of instillation and continued to improve across visits through 1 year (Nichols et al 2019 ). CLINICAL GUIDELINES The American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) Preferred Practice Pattern for Dry Eye Syndrome makes treatment recommendations based on disease severity ( AAO 2018 ). For mild disease, education and environmental modifications, aqueous enhancement using artificial tears, gels or ointments, and eyelid therapy with warm compresses and eyelid scrubs are recommended. For moderate disease, the AAO recommends in addition to the treatments for mild disease, anti -inflammatory agents such as topical cyclosporine, lifitegrast, and corticosteroids; punctal plugs ; or spectacle side shields and moisture chambers. Low-dose topical corticosteroid therapy should be used at infrequent intervals for short periods of time (ie, several weeks) to suppress ocular surface inflammation. Patients prescribed corticosteroids for dry eye should be monitored for AEs such as increased intraocular pressure and cataract formation. For severe disease, the AAO recommends in addition to all the previously mentioned treatments, systemic cholinergic agonists or anti -inflammatory agents, mucolytic agents, contact lenses, permanent punctal occlusion, or tarsorrhaphy. Tear Film and Ocular Surface Society Dry Eye Workshop II (TFOS DEWS II) ( Jones et al 2017) A step -wise approach is recommended based on disease severity. Step 1: education, lid hygiene, warm compress, modification of environmental factors, omega -3 fatty acid supplementation, or ocular lubricants. Ocular lubricants are considered mainstay of treatment, however, they only offer palliative relief with no disease modifying potential. Step 2 (if above inadequate): Non-pharmacological: punctual occlusion (most widely used tear conservation approach), pulsed light therapy, moisture goggles Pharmacological: topical antibiotic for blepharitis, limited duration topical corticosteroid, topical allogenic , or therapeutic contact lenses Step 4(if above inadequate): longer duration topical steroid, membrane grafts, punctual occlusion or other surgical approaches. 215 Data as of August 11, 2020 RLP/KMR Page 4 of 6 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

SAFETY SUMMARY Cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion Cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected hypersensitivity to any ingredient in the formulation. Warnings include the risk of eye injury and contamination when administering the medication if the vial tip touches the eye or other surfaces and use with contact lenses. Cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion should not be administered while wearing contact lenses. If contact lenses are worn, they should be removed prior to the administration of the emulsion. Lenses may be reinserted 15 minutes following administration of cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion. Ocular burning was the most frequently reported AE. Other AEs include d ocular pain, conjunctival hyperemia, discharge, foreign body sensation, pruritus, stinging, and visual disturbance (most often blurring) . Cyclosporine ophthalmic solution The ophthalmic solution has no contraindications for use. Cyclosporine ophthalmic solution has similar warnings as the ophthalmic emulsion formulation. Pain on drop instillation was the most frequently reported AE followed by conjunctival hyperemia. Other AEs included blepharitis, eye irritation, headache, and urinary tract infection. Lifitegrast ophthalmic solution Lifitegrast ophthalmic solution is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to lifitegrast or to any of the other ingredients in the formulation. The most commonly reported AEs reported in 5 to 25% of patients were instillation site irritation, dysgeusia, and reduced visual acuit y. Other AEs reported in 1 to 5% of patients included blurred vision, conjunctival hyperemia, eye irritation, headache, increased lacrimation, eye discharge, eye discomfort, eye pruritus, and sinusitis. Post marketing AEs reported include rare serious cases of hypersensitivity (anaphylactic reaction, bronchospasm, respiratory conjunctivitis, angioedema, and allergic dermatitis), eye swelling, and rash.

See the current prescribing information for full details CONCLUSION Restasis (cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion) is the first ophthalmic emulsion FDA -approved to increase tear production in patients with KCS. Although the exact mechanism of action of this agent is unknown, it is assumed that it acts as a partial immunomodul ator. Xiidra (lifitegrast ophthalmic solution) is the second prescription treatment to receive FDA -approval for treatment of DED . Lifitegrast is a novel small molecule integrin antagonist that inhibits T cell-mediated inflammation by blocking the binding of 2 important cell surface proteins (lymphocyte function- associated antigen 1 [LFA -1] and intercellular adhesion 1 [ICAM -1]), thus lessening overall inflammatory responses . However, the exact mechanism of action of lifitegrast in DED is unknown. In August 2018, the FDA approved Cequa (cyclosporine ophthalmic solution) to increase tear production in patients with KCS ( Cequa prescribing information 2018). This is the first cyclosporine product to utilize nanomicellar technology. This formulation allows the drug molecule to overcome solubility difficulties, penetrate the eye's aqueous layer, and prevent the release of active lipophilic molecule prior to penetration. In clinical trials, cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion demonstrated significant increases in tear production and decreases in dry eye symptoms compared to placebo and demonstrated safety for up to 3 years ( Sall et al 2000, Barber et al 2005 , Roberts et al 2007 ). For the new nanomicellar cyclosporine ophthalmic solution, there was a significantly (p < 0.01) higher percentage of eyes with increases of 10 mm from baseline in Schirmer wetting as compared to vehicle at day 84 (Cequa prescribing information 2018, Goldberg et al 2019, Luchs et al 2018, Sheppard et al 2020, Tauber et al 2018 ). Lifitegrast also demonstrated significant improvements in the signs and symptoms of DED compared with placebo in clinical trials. Lifitegrast was well tolerated with no unexpected AEs in a 1-year safety exposure study ( Donnenfeld et al 2016, Holland et al 2017, Semba et al 2012, Sheppard et al 2014 , Tauber et al 2015). Ophthalmic immunomodulators improve signs of DED in patients who are inadequately treated with AT and other therapies. Lifitegrast demonstrated improvement in symptoms of DED ; however, cyclosporine has not consistently improved symptoms in DED compared to placebo. Direct comparative data between cyclosporine products and lifitegrast are lacking. REFERENCES American Academy of Ophthalmology Cornea/External Disease Panel, Preferred Practice Pattern Guidelines.
