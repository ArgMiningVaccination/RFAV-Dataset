This submission applies the process outlin ed in Attachment B of The Intergovernmental Agreement for a National Registration and Accreditation Scheme for the Heal th Professions (IGA) , which outlin es six criteria to be met before registration of any health profession is considered.2 The IGA states 'it was envisaged that other health professions would be added over time.'3 This submission will focus on all of these cri teria with a spec ial focus on Criterion 2 which requires that the occupations' practice presents a serious risk to public health and safety which co uld be minimised by regulation. This submission seeks to demonstrate that registration of these three health professions is justified and will provide evidence of the risk to public health and safe ty and the reasons why current regulator y mechanisms are insufficient in minimi sing this risk. In achieving tha t goal , this submission will be cogni sant of the COAG Best Practice Regulation Guidelines (COAG guidelines)4 which requires any regula tory response to first find a case for a ction , any decisions made should consider self-regulation, co -regulation and non -regulatory options and it should provide the greatest ne t benefit for the community which is proportional to the issue being addresse d.5 Although this submission is primarily focussed on the Australian context , informatio n has been accessed from other jurisdictions such as the USA and Canada . The use of international evidence is justified on the basis that the types of therapies used in Nat/WHM/NM in Australia are applied in these other jurisdictions and evidence of harm reported in those jurisdictions provides lessons about the potential risk of the provision of Nat/WHM/NM in Australia. In all examples used in this submission adverse outcomes involve only unlicensed or unregistered practitioners using Nat/WHM/NM. Risks a ssocia ted with clinical judgments are inherent in any health pro fession. This submission will outline some of the documented examples of any type of injury that has been reported to have occurred in relation to Nat/WHM/NM in Australia , the USA and Canada . This su bmission will draw from data found in the significant La Trobe University Report , The Practice and Regulatory Requirements of Naturopath y and Western Herbal Medicine November 2005 (School of Public Health - La Trobe University) , V Lin, A Bensoussan, S P Myers, P McCabe, M Cohen, Sophie Hill and G Howse6 (the La Trobe report ) which is the most authoritative and comparatively recent research about Nat/WHM and the regulatory requirements for these modalities . This submission will discuss other issues and update information, events and regulatory responses that have occurred since 2005 including data about nutritional medicine which has emerged as a significant modality since 2005 .

Criterion 2: Do the activities of the occupation pose a significant risk of harm to the health and safety of the public? Criterion 3: Do existing regulatory or other mechanisms fail to address health and safety issues? Criterion 4: Is regulation possible to implement for the occupation in question? Criterion 5: Is regulation practical to implement for the occupation in question? Criterion 6: Do the benefits to the public of regulation clearly outweigh the potential negative impact of such regulation? 3 The Intergovernmental Agreement for a National Registrat ion and Accreditation Scheme for the Health Professions (26 March 2008), p 22, 1.1 4 Council of Australian Governments, Best Practice Regulation Guidelines: A Guide for Ministerial Councils and National Standard Setting Bodies , October 2007. 5 Ibid pp 4 -6. 6 http://health.vic.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/320188/naturopathy -final1106.pdf Australian Natural Therapists Association 2 provides an evidence -based analysis of the regulatory structure of naturopathy and western herbal medicine applying the AHMAC criteria (which are the same as the IGA criteria) . Significantly , 11 years ago the La Trobe report recommended that based upon AHMAC criteria that statutory regulation is warranted7 for the following reasons :8 'there is a level of risk in naturopathy and WH M comparable to other regulated professions; there is a particular risk related to the interaction of her bal medicine and pharmaceutical drugs and the need for appropriate prescribing frameworks; existing regulatory frameworks are insufficient to protect against professional misconduct variable arrangements currently exist for profes sional practice standards among professional associations and professional associati ons have been unable to come to common arrangement; and variable standards exist among education and training institutions with no evidence of movement towards common standards (including th e failure of current regulatory frameworks to ensure basic standards for education ).' Although there have been changes in the regulatory structure for Nat/WHM/NM since 2005 , the factual basis for the conclusions reached by the La Tr obe report is still relevant in 2016 . Although the focus of the La Trobe report is on Nat/WHM it is clear from the definitions below, the data provided by the La Trobe report and the examples of negative outcomes specified in Category A , there is a substantial degree of overlap between these three health professions including data about the use of both nutritional medicine and Western Herbal Medicine by naturopaths and vice versa. Definitions for Western Herbal Medicine Nutritional Medic ine and Naturopathy For the purpose of this submission , it is worthwhile to describe definitions of each of these three professions . Western Herbal Medicine Herbal medicines include herbs, herbal materials, herbal preparation s and finished herbal products that contain as active ingredients parts of plants, or other plant materials, or combinations. Herbs: crude plant material such as leaves, flowers, fruit, seed s, stems, wood, bark, roots, rhizomes or other plant parts, which may be entire, fragmented or powdered. Herbal materials: in addition to herbs, fresh juices, gums, fixed oils, essential oils, resins and dry powders of herbs. In some countries, these materials may be processed by various local procedures, such as steamin g, roasting, or stir -baking with honey, alcoholic beverages or other materials. 7 A similar recommendation arose from the Minister for Health and Ageing, Complementary Medicines in the Australian Health System, Report to the Parliamentary Secretary , (September 2003), 129. 8 La Trobe report, above n 6, 305 -306. Australian Natural Therapists Association 3 Herbal preparations: the basis for finished herbal products may include comminuted or powdered herbal materials, or extracts, tinctures and fatty oils of herbal materials. They are produced by extraction, fractionation, purification, concentration or other physical or biological processes. They also include preparations made by steeping or heating herbal materials in alcoholic beverages and/or honey, or in other materials. Finished herbal products: herbal preparations made from one or more herbs. If more than one herb is used, the term mixture herbal product can also be used. Finished herbal products and mixture herbal products may contain excipients in addition to the activ e ingredients. However, finished products or mixture products to which chemically defined active substances have been added, including synthetic compounds and/or isolated constituents from herbal materials, are not considered to be herbal .9 Nutritional Medicine 'Nutriti onal medicine is defined as the study of interactions of nutritional factors with human biochemistry, physiology and anatomy and how the clinical application of a knowledge of these interactions can be used in the modulation of structure a nd function for the prevention and treatment of disease as well as the betterment of health .10 'Nutrition can be defined as the sum of all processes involved in the intake, assimilation and utilisation of nutrients. The clinical nutritional medicine approa ch is based on a wide range of published scientific information and is essentially integrative, deriving concepts and knowledge from many disciplines including physics, chemistry, anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, pathology, pharmacology, toxicology, gene tics, anthropology, palaeontology, microbiology, molecular biology, environmental science, nutrition, food science, psychology and sociology .'11 The \"nutritional factors \" assessed and addressed by nutritional medicine include diets, food substances, non -food dietary components and isolated nutritional compounds. These compounds may be synthetic or of natural origin and may involve varying degrees of processing and refinement. Therapeutic interventions may involv e the withdrawal or administration of any such compounds, potentially at supraphysiological levels. Naturopathy Naturopathy is a distinct type of primary care medicine that blends age -old healing traditions with scientific advances and current research. Naturopathy is guided by a unique set of principles that recognise the body's innate healing capacity, emphasise disease prevention, and encourage individual responsibility to obtain optimal health. Naturopathic treatment modalities include diet and clini cal nutrition, behavioural change, hydrotherapy, homoeopathy, botanical medicine and physical medicine .12 'In general, naturopathy emphasises prevention, treatment and the promotion of optimal health through the use of therapeutic methods and modalities which encourage the self -healing process - the vis medicatrix naturae. The philosophical approaches of natur opathy include prevention of 9 World H ealth Organisati on, Definitions http://www.who.int/medicines/areas/traditional/definitions/en/ (Accessed 13th August 2016) 10 Stephen Davies, 'Scientific and Ethical Foundations of Nutritional Medicine Part 1 - Evolution, Adaption and Health,' (1991 ) 2 Journal of Nutritional Medicine 227-247, 227. 11 Ibid 12 Fleming, S, & Gutknecht, N (2010 ), 'Naturopathy and the Primary Care Practice', (2010) 37 Primary Care , 119- 136, 119. Australian Natural Therapists Association 4 disease, encouragement of the body's inherent healing abilities, natural treatment of the whole person, personal responsibility for one's health and education of patients in health -promoting lifestyles. Naturopathy blends centu ries-old knowledge of natural therapies with current advances in the understanding of health and human systems. Naturopathy, therefore, can be described as the general practice of natural health therapies .'13 Naturopathic philosophy of practice is succinctly stated in the six principles of naturopathic medicine. These principles guide naturopathic medical treatments and could be applied in integrative settings to organise the use of conventional treatments with CAM therapies : 1. The Healing Power of Nature (Vis Medicatrix Naturae). The body has an inherent capacity to maintain health and treatments guide and support this capacity. 2. Identify and Treat the Causes (Tolle Causam). The naturopathic physician promotes healing by addressing the root cause of an illness. 3. First Do No Harm (Primum Non Nocere). Interventions should be as non -invasive as possible and proceed to more disruptive and potentially harmful treatments only when necessary. 4. Doctor as Teacher (Docere). The role of the naturopathic physician includes educating the patient, involving him or her in the healing process and establishing an essential physician/patient partnership. 5. Treat the Whole Person (Tolle Totum). All aspects of an individual's health , including mental/emotional, behavioural, genetic, structural, environmental, social, and spiritual factors , need to be taken into account. 6. Prevention. Prevention of future illnesses and optimising wellness is imperative. Prevention is more cost -effecti ve health care and less stressful to patients th an treating chronic disease s.14 Methods applied by Nat/WHM/NM In Nat/WHM/NM a variety of methods can be used to evaluate potential causative factors. Some of the more common tools used in the clinical evaluation process include a thorough medical history (including family history of disease), dietary analysis (including eating habits and food intake), lifestyle analysis (including exercise, stress burden, sleeping patterns), clinical signs and symptoms (such as blood pressure, body composition and tissue condition). Laboratory tests, such as blood, stool, hair and urine analyses for vitamin and mineral levels as well as body metabolite balances, can also be employed to determine nutrient deficiencies, he avy metal toxicity, fat and protein imbalances, immune status, blood sugar balance, kidney, liver and digestive function. 13 World Health Organization, 2010, \"Benchmarks for training in traditional / complementary and alternative medicine.

Australian Natural Therapists Association 5 This information (regarding nutrient adequacy, food quality, dietary behaviours, lifestyle and environment factors, as well as the causes of dysfunction), is assessed by the practitioner and used to educate the patient, create a personalised diet and lifestyle plan and prescribe focussed supplementation for the individual where necessary. Scientific evidence, ethics and sound clinical reasoning guide practice to ensure that treatment recommendations are efficacious and safe.15 Criterion 1: Is it appropriate for Health Ministers to exercise responsibility for regulating the occupation in question, or does the occupation more appropriate ly fall within the domain of another Ministry? Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) , a considerable part of which would involve expenditure on Nat/WHM/NM , now constitutes a significant part of the Australian health care sector. A 2007 study suggested that the estimated number of patient visits to CAM practitioners is similar to the number of visits to conventional medical providers (69.2 million v. 69.3 million) with national out -of-pocket expenditure s on CAM products of over $4. 1 billion .16 In some areas of Australia, CAM practitioners providing primary care services out number conventional primary care physicians .17 It has been calculated that nearly 10% of the Australian female population see a naturopath or western herbal medici ne practitioner and this increases to 16% when dealing with complex conditions.18 Accordingly , it is important that , along with orthodox medicine , the regulation of Nat/WHM/NM is given careful consideration. As the use of Nat/WHM/NM is a multi -billion dollar industry in Australia and it is demonstrated that these three professions are providing a substantial level of health services to Australians alongside orthodox medicine , it is appropriate for Health Ministers to exercise responsibility for these occupation s rather than the occupations being regulated by another Ministry. If the IGA is appropriately within the portfolio of the Health Ministers then there is no reason why the regulation of these occupations should fall within any other Ministry domain . While t he number of Nat/WHM/NM practitioners in Australia is not clear , there may be as many as 10,000 Naturopaths and Western Herbalists in Australia.19 Although the type of therapies, substances and health philosophy applied in Nat/WHM/NM may be different from orthodox medicine , the focus is upon clients' health and it is appropriate that Health Ministers consider regulation of these occupation s. 15 Ian Kerridge, Michael Lowe and Cameron Stewart, Ethics and law for the health professions, (4th Edition, The Federation Press 2013) pp 822-828. 16 Charlie C Xue et al, 'Complementary and Alternative Medicine Use in Australia: A National Population -Based Survey' (2 007) 13 (6) Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine 643, 643 . 17 Jon Wardle et al, 'Distribution of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) Providers in Rural New South Wales, A ustralia: A Step towards Explaining High CAM Use in Rural Health?'

Australian Natural Therapists Association 6 Criterion 2: Do the activities of the occupation pose a significant risk of harm to the health and safety of the public? The following should be considered when assessing whether there is significant risk of harm to the health and safety of the public: the nature and severity of the risk to the client group; the nature and severity of the risk to the wider public; and the nature and severity of the risk to the practitioner. Areas which could be explored to identify a risk to public health and safety are: to what extent does the practice of the occupation involve the use of equipment, materials or processes which could cause a serious threat to public health and safety; to what extent may the failure of a practitioner to practice in particular ways ( that is, follow certain procedures, observe certain standards, or attend to certain matters), result in a serious threat to public health and safety; are intrusive techniques used in the practice of the occupation, which can cause a serious, or life threa tening danger; to what extent are certain substances used in the practice of the occupation, with particular emphasis on pharmacological compounds, dangerous chemicals or radioactive substances; and is there significant potential for practitioners to cau se damage to the environment or to cause substantial public health and safety risk. Risks associated with Nat/WHM/NM The discussion of the risk of harm to the health and safety of the public will involve a discussion of the types of risks normally enco untered in the practice of Nat/WHM/NM. Th is submission will then consider specific examples of when adverse events have occurred in the provision of Nat/WHM/NM and views expressed by practitioner s and GPs and the evidence of health complaints bodies in the frequency of health care complaints about Nat/WHM/NM. Details of negative outcomes associated with the provision of Nat/WHM/NM are documented in Schedule A to this submission. Type of Risk of Treatment The risks associated with the Nat/WHM/NM might be considered to fall into two categories :20 a. risks associated with the clinical judgment of the Nat/WHM/NM practitioner. This category includes two sub -categories namely (a) adverse events related to acts of commission (such as recommending cessation of medical treatment or failing to avoid known interactions with pharmaceuticals , prescribing substances not well suited to a particular client such as a diabetic , over dosage of substances which are only toxic a t high levels or prescribing for prolonged periods with potentia l for impacts on liver function ),21 (b) acts of omission (such as misdiagnosis , failure to detect underlying pathology , failure to refer to an appropriate practitioner or insufficient advice about risks of treatment ) are evidenced below. Concerns have 20 La Trobe report, above n 6, 33. 21 La Trobe report, above n 6, 34. Australian Natural Therapists Association 7 been expressed among consumers and healthcare practitioners about the nature and extent of such risks. b. risks related directly to the consumption of nutritional and herbal m edicines.22 In the same way that pharmaceutical substances produce unexpected impacts, herbal medicines and other substances commonly used by Nat/WHM/NM can and do produce predictable and unpredictable effects. Cases were identified in b oth of these areas to include direct toxicity, toxicity related to overdose of a preparation and interaction with Western pharmaceuticals. Unpredictable effects included allergic idiosyncratic impacts. In some cases , herbal substances may be adulterated with toxic substances or contain pharmaceutical substances. The table below in Schedule A shows in chronological order documented examples of adverse events involving Nat/WHM/NM indicating what modality is involved, where the event occurred and the source of the report. In addition , the categor ies of the types of risk s involved is also specifie d. Health Complaints The level of complaints abou t health issues may provide a profile of the risk of particular therapies and the activities of specific practitioners. There are health complaint bodies in all States and Territories in Australia which compile and publish health complaint statistics.23 The La Trobe report looked at examples of complaints against alternative medicine practitioners to Health Complaints Commissioner s in a number of jurisdictions over the perio d for the period 1997 -2004.24 The ACT, Tasmania and the Northern Territory health complaints body made no mention of alternative or other providers in its statistics . The difficulty with the evidence provided by health complaints bodies for the purpose of analysing the complaint profile for Nat/WHM/NM was that in most cases little detail was provided about the modalities complained against with most categorised under the term 'alternative health providers, alternative therapists, alternative health, alternative providers or other providers '. The most complete evidence of health complaints in regard to modalities the subject of this submission in the specified period was Queensland 's Health Quality and Complaints Commission which documented nine complaints in the tw o years to February 2004 and 20 complaints in ten years to February 2004.25 The m ost commo n complaints for naturopathy relate to sexual misconduct, medication, misdiagnosis and treatment negligence. This data does not provide information about what result ed from these complaints namely whether they were investigated, were they dismissed or was there regulatory action such as a referral to police or other governmental authority. More recently , the New South Wales Health Care Complaints Commission Annual Report 2013 - 2014 contained records of 17 complaints against alternative health providers (p resumably not naturopaths, or massage therapists who are specifically covered by data) suggesting that these practitioners may include western herbal medicine and nutritional medicine. The complaints against alternative health providers dealt with issues i n descending order of frequency in profession al conduct (10), treatment (4) and environment and management of facilities (3). 22 La Trobe report above n 6, 37. 23 Healthcare Complaints Act 1993 (NSW); Health Complaints Act 2016 (Vic.); Health Ombudsman Act 2013 (Qld); Health and Disability Services (Complaints) Act 1995 (WA); Health Complaints Act 1995 (Tas); Health and Community Services Complaints Act 2004 (SA); Human Rights Commission Act 2005 (ACT); Health and Community Services Complaints Act 1998 (NT). 24 La Trobe report above n 6, 35. 25 Ibid, 36 Australian Natural Therapists Association 8 Under the category of natural therapist there were two complaints related to professional conduct. In relation to naturopaths ther e were five complaints about professional conduct (3), communication/ information (2) in New South Wales in the 2013 -2014 financial year .26 Recent data provided by the New South Wales Health Care Complaints Commission Annual Report 2014 -2015 contained records of 12 complaints against alternative health providers (presumably not naturopaths, homoeopaths and massage therapists who are specifically covered by data) suggesting that these practitioners may include western herbal medicine and nutritional medicine.27 The complaints against alternative health providers dealt with issues in descending order of frequency in professional conduct (6), treatment (2), communication/ information (3), fees/cost s (1). In relation to naturopaths there were in New South Wales in the 2014 -2015 financial year seven complaints about treatment (2), communication/ information (2), medication (3) and fees/costs (1).28 Practitioner reported adverse events in Nat/WHM/NM An impressive workforce survey dealing with adverse events was publish ed in 2004 by A Bensoussan et al .29 Data was obtained using a national survey of practitioners in various alternative modalities. Five questions on the survey related to adverse events in naturopathy, nutritional medicine and herbal m edicine. The survey requested an indication of the number of times an adverse event had occurred over their time in practice.30 Naturopathy often involves the use of herbal medicine, homoeopathy, massage therapy and nutritional medicine. The results of this survey suggest that the respondent best described one of their practice descriptors as herbalism 62% ; naturopathy 76%.31 Based upon the receipt o f 859 surveys return ed the authors suggested the 'estimate of the total adverse events extrapolated to all Australian practitioners who prescribe herbal, nutritional and/ or homoeopathic medicines is 16, 165 events during their practice lifetimes. '32 The types of adverse events recorded dealt with: Nutritional medicine - mild gastrointestinal symptoms (1023); headache s (434); severe gastrointestinal symptoms (150) ; serious adverse events included central nervous system effects (11); signi ficant respiratory distu rbances (8); renal toxicity (1) and one death. Four teen of these adverse events were considered serious enough to require a referral to medical practitioner or hospital.33 Herbal medicine - the most common adverse events for this modality reported were mild gastrointestinal symptoms (1952); headache s (870); menstrual irregularities (322) ; significant skin reactions (307) and severe gastrointestinal symptoms (296) ; serious adverse events included central nervous system effects (17); hepatotoxity (9) and significant respiratory disturbances (9). 82 of these adverse events required a referral to a medical practitioner or a hospital .34 The survey suggested that 33% of practitioners reported their adverse events to third parties though only 27% of the respondents were aware of the Australian adverse drug reaction reporting procedures.35 Overall , the number of adverse events suggests that naturopathy, herbal 26 New Sou th Wales, Health Care Complaints Commission Annual Report 2013 -2014 , 117. 27 New South Wales, Health Care Complaints Co mmission Annual Report 2014 -2015, 112. 28 Ibid 29 A Bensoussan, SP Myers, SM Wu and K O'Connor, Naturopathic and Western Herbal Medicine pra ctice in Australia - a workforce survey, (2004) 12 Complementary Therapies in Medicine , 17-27. 30 Ibid 22 31 Ibid 19 32 Ibid 22 33 Ibid 22 34 Ibid 22 35 Ibid 23 Australian Natural Therapists Association 9 medicine practitioners and nutritional medicine practitioners will need to deal with a significant number of adverse events (some serious) in their practice.36 The authors of the study analysed the results of this study and (excluding mild gastrointestinal symptoms) suggested that a herbalist will have 1.1 adverse events per year of full time practice, .0020 adverse events per consultation and 500 consultations per adverse event.37 Naturopaths were said to have 1.2 adverse events per full time practice and .0025 adverse events per consultation and 400 consultations per adverse event. The authors exclude mild gastrointestinal symptoms to focus 'on potentially more serious adverse reactions that may be distinctly associated with naturopathic or herbal medicine practice.'38 The authors conclude 'The risks and the adequacy of the regulatory arrangements to pro tect public health and safety warrant review in terms of the needs for statutory occupational regulation. The minimisation of risks should be a priority of the herbal and naturopathic professional working with government policy makers.'39 The Bensous san stu dy provide s good ev idence from the perspective of n aturopathy, herbal medicine and nutritional medicine practitioners. The value of the data from this study is enhanced by the further data obtained by a separate workforce study involving a survey of general practitioners discussed in the La Trobe report . In this study general practitioners were asked to report adverse events associated with complementary medicine generally, interactions with complementary medicine and orthodox medicine and events s uch as withdrawal from conventional treatment or delay of diagnosis involving the intervention of a complementary medicine practitioner.40 The general practitioners were asked to identify over the comparatively short period of the previous four weeks adver se events they had encountered involving complementary medicine or a complementary medicine practitioner. Responses were received from 402 doctors who noted that there were 1,548 adverse events o ver that period. The authors have suggested caution about this data owing to the difficulty in remembering after the event which may result in an underestimation of adverse events and may involve an assumption of causality. Of the modalities quoted , herbal medicine (15.6% ) and naturopathy (13.2%) were the leading modalities in this research data. The highest le vel of serious adverse events related to herbal medicine (4.1%) and naturopathy (3.6%) just below chiropractic (4.7%). Herbal medicine was considered to have resul ted in 72 adverse events, 82 interaction issues, 39 withdrawal s from treatmen t, 48 dela ys in diagnosis with a total of 241 of adverse events.41 Naturopathy was seen as involved in 33 adverse events, 34 interaction issues, 67 withdrawal s from treatment, 71 d elays in diagnosis total ling 205 adverse events.42 As the GP's reported that they saw 121 patients per week , this is suggestive of one adverse event for every 125 patient consultation s or one adverse event per week. The La Trobe report noted o nly naturopathy, chiropractic, herbal medicine, massage, and acupuncture featured in medical practitioner handwritten comments in relation to serious cases . GPs generally considered the harm caused by CAM was primarily related more to the scope of practic e, that is, the broad range of clients and conditions treated and a lack of recognition of the limitations to practice . 43 This was seen as contribut ing to incorrect, inadequate, or delayed diagnoses rather than to the specific risks of the therapies themselves. The GPs considered 36 Ibid 37 Ibid 24 38 Ibid 39 Ibid 26 40 La Trobe report above n 6, 50 -52. 41 Ibid 51 42 Ibid 43 La Trobe report above n 6, 51 -52; refer also to Jon Wardle and Jon Adams, 'Naturopaths: Their Role in Primary Health Care Delivery' in , (eds): Jon Adams, Parker Magin, Alex Broom , Primary Health Care and Complementary and Integrative Medicine: Practice a nd Research , Chapter 4, Imperial College Press, (2013) pp.73 -92, 73 ,76. Australian Natural Therapists Association 10 naturopathy and WHM offer ed an alternative health service to that offered by GPs and were accordingly primary care practitioners . As a result they saw patients with the full spectr um of health complaints potentially including serious illnesses. As primary care practitioners, these practitioners are necessarily involved with diagnosis and subsequent treatment.44 Some of the comments from the GP respondents relate to the following mat ters:45 Naturopathy 'Death from superficial melanoma treated by naturopath Naturopath delayed conventional breast cancer treatment for nine months \u2014now inoperable Woman with widespread breast cancer metastases had ineffective naturopathy and herbal treatment instead Wrong diagnosis by naturopath Inappropriate investigations suggested by naturopath Allergic reaction from naturopathy Serious allergic skin reaction from naturopathy Two cases of detox reaction by naturopath using homoeopathy Severe cystic acne as a result of diet manipulation by naturopath Herbal Medicine Herbal interactions with contraceptive pill Aplastic anaemia after taking kelp tablets Serious interaction between Ginkgo and aspirin/NSAID causing iron deficiency Anaemia and angina requiring ho spital admission and transfusion Two near -fatal reactions to St John's Wort in combination with Ginkgo reported to ADRAC Serious interaction between St John's Wort and Warfarin General Comments Many serious reactions due to complementary therapies too difficult to remember Many delayed or incorrect diagnoses due to complementary therapies Many patients do not tell doctors what complementary medications they are taking Some doctors requested a database of interactions between herbal and traditional medic ines Some doctors suggested that profit motive overrides clinical judgment in complementary therapies .' Risks associated with practice46 All he althcare involves risks from decisions made by the practitioner involving clinical judgment which can involve both risks of omission or commission. The La Trobe report suggests that , although these studies indicate there are c ases of adverse events related to both commission and omis sion, this does not appear to re present widespread malpractice. The most significant type of complaint by clients to professional associations related to communication problems rather than with the health practice itself.47 In regard to the adverse events from use of herbal medicine and use of nutritional supplements it is difficult to determine whether these adverse events were caused by negligence by the practitioner (such as inappropriate prescribing) or were the result o f adverse reactions to the substance itself. Primarily the reports by GPs of severe adverse reactions, were more related to the scope of practice applied with a lack of understanding or 44 La Trobe report above n 6, 52. 45 La Trobe report above n 6, 52. 46 Ibid 53 47 Ibid Australian Natural Therapists Association 11 recognition of the limitations of their practice, contributing to inco rrect, inadequate, or delayed diagnoses rather than to the specific ris ks of the therapies themselves. The La Trobe report suggested that there was a ' prima facie , risk associated with a workforce of clinicians who consult directly with patients who presen t with a f ull range of health conditions' and ' whose principal tools of trade involve ingestible medicines '.48 Risks associated with the consum ption of herbal and nutritional medicines49 Herbal and nutritional medicines can produce unexpected reactions in people including direct toxicity, overdose toxicity, and toxicity associate d with interaction with pharmaceuticals. Also possible are idiosyncratic, allergic and anaphylactic r eactions to herbal medications. Some herbs have well kno wn potential for causing toxic reactions only some of which are restricted by current legislation while a number of less toxic substances are available for practi tioners to prescribe . Risks can arise related to the inappropriate handling or manufacture of herbal and nutritional medicines especially in the context of the permissible supply, sale and manufacturing of herbal substances for some Nat/WHM/NM practitioners under the exemptions from the manufacturing , listing and registration provisions of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1994 discussed below. To date , few example s of injury caused by these practices exist in Australia or overseas. Numerous examples of injurious interactions between pharmaceutical drugs and herb al and nutritional medicines have been do cumented though the level of this risk is unknown.50 Implications of the risk profile for Nat/WHM/NM 51 The number of adverse events associated with WHMs and nutritional medicines recor ded in Australia is significant including matters such as severe gastrointestinal symptoms, palpitations and hepatotoxicity. 'The workforce survey data suggest s that practitioners will experience one serious adverse event every 11 months of full time practice and 2.3 adverse events for every 1,000 consultations (excluding mild gastrointestinal effects) .'52 Although one third of practitioners reported that they notify adverse events , these reports were generally made to the manufacturer or suppli er of the product, rather than r eporting adverse events to the TGA Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting System (ADRS). Although the ADRS database does refer specifically to complementary medicine the reporting system appears not to be widely used by unregistered practitioners.53 Nearly half of the 22 categ orised complaints from patients acknowledged by Nat/WHM/NM professional associations related to poo r communication by practitioners which seems to be a more significant problem than adverse events from the commission of treatment which reflects in only fiv e of the 22 complaints .54 The La Trobe report suggests t his pattern of complaints is likely to represent significant under -reporting requiring an educational response for Nat/WHM/NM educators . One unpublished thesis suggested that the reported incidences of adverse reactions for CAM will rise significantly when greater clarity for reporting is understood.55 ANTA maintains a Natural Therapy Adverse Events Register.56 48 Ibid 49 Ibid 50 Ibid 51 La Trobe report above n 6, 54 -55. 52 Ibid 54 53 https://www.tga.gov.au/report -side-effect -medicine. 54 La Trobe report above n 6, 54. 55 Wardle, ' Why run a risk agenda for CAM regulation?', (2008) 20 Australian Journal of Medical Herbalism 136, 137 from G Moses, Increasing the Frequency, quality and breadth of adverse drug reaction rep orting by consumers and health profession, Doctorate of Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy, Brisbane, University of Queensland (2005). 56 Refer to Schedule C below p 58. Australian Natural Therapists Association 12 The degree of risk to public health and safety established in regard to the use of Nat/WHM/NM requires serious consideration about the need for more effective occupational regulation focussed on minimisation of risks. Nat/WHM/NM Workforce The La Trobe report provided some clarity about the parameters of the workforce based upon a questionnaire for w hich there were 432 respondents . A total of 76.1% of practitioners suggested that they practiced under more than one area of practice supporting the view that there is overlapping in the modalities practice d 'with naturopaths including herbal medicine in their practice up to 44% of the time and herbalists regularly practising both homoeopathy and nutritional medicine.'57 This data suggested that the workforce was predominantly female with the intensity of pra ctice very variable with the mean number of hours per week being 24, which is suggestive of 22 consultations per week.58 If a calculation is made across the Naturopathy and WHM workforce in Australia that suggests nearly two million consultations in 2003 in volving costs of $85 million dollars. In terms of education , the level of education was from six months to six years with most having at least three years of education in herbal or naturopathic practice with some (11%) having other health related qualifications. Many (88%) were involved in continuing education.59 More than half of the workforce belonged to two or more professional associations with a la rge number of professional association s being identified. 60 Until r ecently , the minimum educational standard to commence practice in Nat/WHM/NM was at the level of Advanced Diploma under Health Training Package (HLT07) . Since December 2015 , the required educational standard for Nat/WHM/NM is a Bachelor degree subject to the teach -out period for existing student s that ceases in December 2018 . It should be noted that e ven when the AQF level 7 bachelor degree level of education impacts on the level of education of the Nat/WHM/NM workforce this will not stop practice in Nat/WHM/NM by an uneducated or virtually uneducated practitioner. Although an untrained person might have difficulty in attaining membership wit h most professional associations; there would be difficulty in gaining access to health fund rebates and professional indemnity insurance , these matters would not make the practice of Nat/WHM/NM impos sible unless the practitioner fa lls foul of the negative licensing regime under NSW, Qld or South Australia61 (or eventually the national scheme in due course ) so as to be subject to criminal charges and or a prohibition order. The ability of some undereducated Nat/WHM/NM practitioners to provide treatment is a somewhat alarming circumstance , as there are clear risks associated with the treatment modalities used as outlined above. In addition , the range of herbal and nutritional medic ines in use continues to expand. Most Nat/WHM/NM practitioners are involved in primar y care of people and necessarily participate in the d iagnosis and treatment of health problems. The scope of practice of all Nat/WHM/NM and particularly naturopathy is broad and overlapping dealing with a wide range of health problems. Nat/WHM/NM practitioners do not have access to a range of diagnostic tools of orthodox medicine and need to understand when it is appropriate to refer to orthodox medicine. Another major risk of Nat/WHM/NM is the risk of misdiagnosis with the danger of this being greater if clinical training hours are inadequate and there is inadequate 57 La Trobe report above n 6, 99. 58 Ibid 115 59 Ibid 116 60 Ibid 116 61 New South Wales and later South Australia enacting a Code of Conduct for Unregistered Health Practitioners. Queensland and Victoria are the first states to enact the national code under the Healthcare Ombudsman Act 2013 (Qld) and in Victoria under the Health Complaints Act 2016 (Vic) Schedule 2. Australian Natural Therapists Association 13 exposure to a range of health conditio ns, settings and demographics. This is better dealt with under the new degree standard for education of practitioners involving greater quality and volume of learning though the position of educationally non -compliant practitioner s remains. For people who use both Nat/WHM/NM and orthodox medicine , there are risks associated with interactions between and misunderstandings about the trea tment modalities used and potential drug interactions between different health practitioners. This risk is exacerbated by a lack of communication re garding treatment among various providers and patients where 34% of cli ents consuming herbal medicine were concurr ently taking pharma ceutical medications (excluding vitamin and mineral supplements) .62 This lack of communication can lead to a negative outcome for clients. The reticence to report to GPs their use of CAM was because the doctor might reject the therapy or because they felt that they should be in charge of their health. The lack of communication between consumers and practitioners is a particular cause for concern.63 Criterion 2, Conclusion Based upon the level of demonstrated serious risk that applies for the practice of Nat/WHM/NM; the concerns about the current ability of under educated practitioners to practice relatively freely ; the inability for consumers to readily ascertain which prac titioner has the requisite education and training ; and the fact that many Nat/WHM/NM practitioners practice as primary health practitioners is suggestive of the need to provide greater regulatory control over these professions. Criterion 3: Do existing regulatory or other mechanisms fail to address health and safety issues? Once the particular health and safety issues have been identified, they are addressed through: other regulations, for example, risk due to skin penetration addressed via regulation s governing skin penetration and/or the regulation of the use of certain equipment, or industrial awards; supervision by registered practitioners of a related occupation; and self-regulation by the occupation . The health and safety risks of the provision of Nat/W HM/NM are documented above and include the reported adverse outcomes documented in Schedule A . These health and safety risks have resulted in some cases in very serious health outcomes . Current professional regu lation of Nat/WHM/NM is primarily based upon self-regulation which is inadequate to deal with the risks of Nat/WHM/NM .64 The regulation of Nat/WHM/NM involves both the application of general legislative provisions dealing with the activities of any health professional (such as the Australian Consumer Law) and some legislation which deals with more specific issues for Nat/WHM/NM such as the Therapeutic Goods legislation or othe r negative licensing provisions discussed below . The primary professional regulatory organ s are professional associations which apply differing standards. Regulation by Self -Regulation 62 La Trobe report above n 6, 249. 63 La Trobe report above n 6, 249. 64 Ibid 295 -296 Australian Natural Therapists Association 14 Self-regulation has lim ited ability to apply minimum levels of entry to the professions through membership of a professional association applying requirements for education and training. The current regulatory framework is fragmented and lacks a level of coherence available through statutory regulation . There is little control on entry into the profession or practicing Nat/WHM/NM in Australia .65 Even if a Nat/WHM/NM practitioner is not a member of a specific professional association because (a) the practitioner does not comply with required educ ational standards or (b) for financial reasons or (c) their membership is withdrawn after disciplinary action leading to expulsion , that person can either seek membership with another profes sional association or continue their practice with some limitations . A person stating that they are a Nat/WHM/NM practitioner or a forme r professional association member, deregistered health therapists such as chiropractors, osteopaths or TCM practitioners cann ot be prevented from holding out they are Nat/WHM/NM practitioners .66 This applies unless the practitioner acts in a mann er that breaches consumer legislation such as indicating they have qualif ications or membership they do not have resulting in a court order requiring cessation of that activity or the practitioner is subject to a prohibition order under a negative licensin g regime . Many breaches may not be detected by regulators who are averse to commencing regulatory action except in cases of clear breaches .67 This suggests that these practitioners cannot be effectively policed in the current self -regulatory setting. Under self -regulation , professional associations normally establish standards of practice. Numerous professional associations represent Nat/WHM/NM practitioners each with its own standards of practice, minimum educational qualifications for entry and disciplinary procedures. This results in industry standards that are piecemeal and inconsistent and disciplinary procedures that lack transparency and consistency .68 Smaller professional association s have resisted amalgamation into larger professional assoc iations to allow an orderly movement to professional status . This has resulted in a plethora of inconsistent standards of practice and education and a lack of expertise in developing a tr anspa rent, consistent, rigorous and fair mechanism for complaints and investigation with appropriate avenues of appeal. The size of some professional associations means the complaint processes may not be properly funded .69 Market pressures to attract membership by professional associations may result in lower standards and differences in standards and may have been a reason for splits from within professional associations exacerbatin g differentiation in standards.70 Further, internal divisions within the professions tend to exacerbate these issues.71 It is worthwhile to consider some of the legislative provisions which specifically or generally regulate Nat/WHM/NM in Australia. The current legislative framework that exists in Australia as it applies to the practice of Nat/WHM/NM , is deficient . This regulatory structure as outlined below provides regulation for therapeutic goods, consumer legislation, health complaints and negative licensing. The integrity of this regulatory structure relies to a great extent on the professional standards of the Nat/WHM/NM practitioners who are required to satisfy these legislative standards. This standard currently also relies upon the quality of the profess ional 65 Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council, Final Report, Options for Regulation of Unregistered Health Practitioners , April 2 013, 28. 66 J Wardle, A Steel and J Adams, 'A Review of Tensions and Risks in Naturopathic Education and Training in Australia: A Need for Regulation,' (2012) 18 (4) The Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine 363, 364. 67 https://www.tga.gov.au/re gulatory -compliance -framework 68 Wardle, above n 67, 364; Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council, Final Report, Options for Regulation of Unregistered Health Practitioners , April 2013, 17. 69 Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council, Final Report, Options for Regulation of Unregistered Health Practitioners , April 2013, 54. 70 Wardle, above n 67, 364, 365. 71 Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council, Final Report, Options for Regulation of Unregistered Health Practitioners , April 2013, 54. Australian Natural Therapists Association 15 standards required by professional associations which varies not only in th e content of those standards but also in the preparedness and capacity to enforce those standards. For many Nat/WHM/NM practitioners this legislative responsibility is justifi ed and accepted but the capacity to control level of education, training and probity of practitioners must be doubted without a more a formal process of regulation. Therapeutic Goods Specific provision is made for the regulation of complementary medicin es in Australia. Complementary medicines including those used by Nat/WHM/NM which involve ingestive substances and therapeutic devices are regulated in Australia by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1994 and regulations .72 The intention of this legislation is to create a national scheme , though because of constitutional limitations , this does not apply to Queensland and Western Australia other than when an activity involves the activities of a corporation related to trade and commerce or transactions across State or national borders or in relation to providing pharmaceutical or repatriation benefits.73 State legislation adopting the Therapeutic Goods Act in the other states plugs the gaps in the scheme for things done within a State. To date, only Queensland and Western Australia have not passed legislation that applies the provisions of the Commonwealth legislation at the State level. The limited constitutional power of the Commonwealth does to some extent impact on the effectiveness of the legislation. For example, a practitioner who prescribes a herb in Queensland or Western Australia is not affected by the Therapeutic Goods Act 1994 and regulations if the transaction has n o international or interstate aspect,74 which would not commonly apply to most transactions of a herbalist in those jurisdictions. For practitioners within the territories, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania, the Therapeutic Goods Act 1 994 and regulations and mirror state and territory legislation will apply to all of those activities.75 The TGA applies a risk-based approach with a two-tiered system for the regulation of all medicines , including complementary medicines :76 Lower risk medicines can be listed on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) which will include most ingestive substances provided by Nat/WHM/NM. Higher risk medicines must be registered on the ARTG which may include some substances provided by Nat/WHM/NM . Some complementary medicines are exempt from the require ment to be included on the ARTG . The Australian Regulatory Guidelines for Complementary Medicines (ARGCM) provides detail on the regulat ion of complementary medicines. Nat/WHM/NM p ractitioners are able to take advantage of the substantial exemptions from many provisions of the TGA. TGA regulation Schedule 5 exempts from registration and listing some medicines that are dispensed or extemporaneously compounded for a partic ular person for therapeutic application to that person.77 In regard to the normal obligation to have a licence to manufacture therapeutic goods , Schedule 8 of the TGA regulations exempts herbalists, nutritionists, naturopaths, practitioners of Traditional C hinese Medicine or homoeopathic practitioners engaged in the manufacture of any herbal, homoeopathic or nutritional supplement preparation, where :78 the preparation is for use in the course of his or her business, and 72 https://www.tga.gov.au/overview -regulation -complementary -medicines -australia 73 Weir, Law and Ethics in Complementary Medicine , (4th edition, Allen and Unwin, 2011), 154 -155. 74 Ibid 154 75 Ibid 156,157 77 Ibid 158,159 78 Ibid 160, 161 Australian Natural Therapists Association 16 the preparations are manufactured on premises that the person carrying on the business occupies and that he or she is able to close so as to exclude the public ; and the person carrying on the business supplies the preparation for administration to a particular person after consulting with tha t person and uses his or her own judgement as to the treatment required. Accordingly, within the parameters of this exemption, there is no obligation on a practitioner to comply with the requirements of Part 3 -3 of the TGA, which requires the obtaining of a licence to manufacture therapeutic goods . These persons may or may not have a substantial level of training or education to professionally and safely perform these services . The basis of this legislation is the risk -based assessment of the quality of Nat/WHM/NM practitioners which relies upon the self -regulation discussed above. The extent to which this self -regulation is not effective in the provision of well credentialed practitioners impacts on the safety of the provision of therapeutic goods to consum ers. TGA post market regulatory acti vity of complementary medicines The TGA undertake regulatory activities post market relating to monitoring of safety, quality and efficacy of listed, registered and included therapeutic goods.79 The TGA also audits manufacturers to ensure compliance with good manufacturing practice. The advertising of complementary medicines including those used by Nat/WHM/NM is regulated by the Therapeutic Goods Advertising Code (TGAC) and the supporting regulations, the consumer legislation and other relevant laws to ensure that marketing promotes the use of the product is socially responsible and does not mislead or dece ive the consumer. There is evidence that the funding for this auditing and overs ight role is limited , as the TGA has a full cost recovery approach to this role leading to a desire to focus on low cost options suggesting a substantial reliance on the training, education and professional approach of unregulated Nat/WHM/NM practitioners.80 Consumer Legislation Like any business, Nat/WHM/NM practitioners in Australia are subject to consumer legislation that imposes obligati ons on the practitioner as to how goods and services are advertised and supplied. T he most important statutes are the Sale of Goods Act (SGA) (almost identical provisions in all States)81 and the Commonwealth Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (CCA) (similar provisions applicable in all States).82 The CCA includes the Australian Consumer Law (ACL), which applies across all jurisdictions in Australia. Many Nat/WHM/NM practitioners sell goods such as, herbal mixtures or herbs, vitamins and oils. These sal es are also subject to the SGA legislation in each state. The SGA deals with transactions relating to 'goods' on matters such as how a contract of sale is formed , implied warranties as to quality and undertaking as to title when title to the goods passes and how the performance of the contract should occur. Goods are defined to include most items and substances sold by practitioners. Misleading or deceptive behaviour The ACL provides that :83 'A person shall not, in trade or commerce, engage in conduct that is misleading or deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive.' This is a very broad provision that 79 The Auditor - General Audit Report no 3 2010 -2012, Performance Audit, Therapeutic Goods Regulation: Complementary Medicine , Australian National Audit Office, 107. 80 Ibid 115 81 Weir above n 74, 173,175. 82 Ibid 175 -179 83 Ibid 176, Australian Consumer Law s 18. Australian Natural Therapists Association 17 covers many specific circumstances dealt with under other sections. A breach of this provision might include exaggerated claims of the effect of services, s uch as miracle slimming techniques where the claims are not verifiable. Another example is unjustified claims made about the curative effects of certain herbal substances sold by practitioners. Unconscionable conduct A person is obliged not to take advantage of a vulnerable client .84 This is fundamental to appropriate professional practice and is reflected in the ACL provision that 'a supplier shall not, in trade or commerce, in connection with the supply or possible supply of goods or services to a person (\"the customer\"), engage in conduct that is, in all the circumstances, unconscionable'. The provision describes examples of unconscionable conduct such as the use of unequal bargaining power or where undue influence or unfair tactics were used in connection with the supply of goods or services. Liability might arise if a client under a disability, such as inexperience or limited English or understanding, was convinced to undertake a course of treatment or to purchase goods in circumstances where the practitioner used his or her position as a health professional to unfairly influence this transaction. False representations Goods and services should be marketed fairly without misrepresentation .85 The ACL provides that a person shall not, in trade or commerce in connection with the supply or possible supply of goods or services or in connection with the promotion by any means of the supply or use of goods or services, make representations such as: falsely representing that goods are of a particular s tandard, quality, value, grade, composition, style or model or have had a particular history or particular previous use ; falsely representing that services are of a particular standard, quality, value or grade ; falsely representing that goods or services h ave sponsorship, approval, performance characteristics, accessories, uses or benefits they do not have ; and making a false or misleading representation concerning the need for any goods or services. In New South Wales, s 99 of the Public Health Act 2010 penalises the promotion or advertisement of health services (this includes complementary medicine) which is false, misleading or deceptive, or likely to be misleading or deceptive. In addition, this provision penalises promotion or advertisement of health services that creates an unjustified expectation of beneficial treatment. The limitations of this form of regulation is that financial injury might arise for a consumer from dealing with a practitioner who unbeknownst to the consumer is acting in a misleading or deceptive manner or any physical injury occurs before the breach of consumer legislat ion is established. Although a remedy for a breach of these provisions may be available through the relevant regulator the Australian Competition and Consumer (ACCC ) or other state consumer bodies obtaining that remedy will be time consuming and perhaps ex pensive for consumers. It has been suggested that ' while consumer protection regulators have successfully prosecuted in some cases, results are mixed and relying on consumer protection legislation to deal with repeated and wilful unethical conduct of unreg istered health practitioners may be insufficient to protect public health and safety.'86 84 Ibid, Australian Consumer Law s 20. 85 Ibid 177, Australian Consumer Law s 29. 86 Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council, Final Report, Options for Regulation of Unregistered Health Practitioners , April 2013, 52. Australian Natural Therapists Association 18 Health Complaints Health Complaints Commissioners in Australia's States and Territories can receive complaints about the professiona l conduct of Nat/WHM/NM practitioners.87 This legislation focuses on investigation, conciliation and the resolution of disputes .88 The avenues for disciplinary action against unregistered practitioners are few, particularly if practitioners are not receptive to conciliation. The ability to enforce standards of treatment under this legislation is limited because there are no sanctions available for unregistered professions unless there are grounds for referral to the police for criminal matters or by civil litigation . The embarrass ment and inconvenience of a complaint made against a practitioner may not always be sufficient to improve their performance . In New South Wales and South Australia, a complaint may result in unregistered and registered health practitioners (in a matter not relevant to their registration) being subject to a prohibition order or interim prohibition order. Refer to below. The proposed National Code of Conduct for Unregistered Health Practitioners based generally on the New South Wales model now enacted by Quee nsland and Victoria will provide similar enforcement powers to deal with unethical practices by unregistered practitioners across Australia.89 GST Section 38.10 of the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 confirms that the supply of health services for chiropractic, osteopathy, acupuncture, naturopathy or herbal medicine (including Traditional Chinese Herbal Medicine) is GST free if: the supplier is a recognised professional in relation to the supply of se rvices of that kind and the supply would generally be accepted, in the profession associated with supplying services of that kind, as being necessary for the appropriate treatment of the recipient of the supply. A 'recognised professional' is a profession al who has permission, approval or registered status under state or territory legislation, or is a member of a professional association with uniform national registration requirements in relation to the supply of services of that kind. A number of major pr ofessional associations have been acknowledged by the Australian Taxation Office as providing appropriate uniform national registration requirements so as to deem their members 'recognised professionals '. The supply of goods associated with the supply of the exempt professional services may also be exempt from GST for chiropractic, osteopathy and acupuncture if the supply is made at the premises at which the service is supplied (the clinic). This would presumably inc lude the supply of acupuncture needles, vitamins and supplements. For herbal medicine, including TCM and naturopathy, the supply of goods such as medicine or herbs is GST free if the goods are supplied in the course of supplying the services and if they are supplied and used or consumed at the premises. This legislation has most likely supported the advantages of membership in an association with natio nal registration standards but i t does not deal with the fact that these profe ssional associations , as even those with a national footprint do not have the same level of educational standards.90 Each professional association is obliged to ensure that only suitably qualified people gain practitioner statu s to comply with the exemption.91 87 Health Care Complaints Act 1993 (NSW); Health Complaints Act 2016 (Vic.); Health Ombudsman Act 2013 (Qld); Health and Disability Services (Complaints) Act 1995 (WA); Health Complaints Act 1995 (Tas); Health and Community Services Complaints Act 2004 (SA); Human Rights Commission Act 2005 (ACT); Health and Community Services Complaints Act 1998 (NT). 88 Health C omplaints Act 2016 (Vic) s154 , Healthcare Ombudsman Act 2013 (Qld) s 288 and Regulation 5. 89 COAG , Final Report: A National Code of Conduct for Health Care workers (17 April 2015) . 90 La Trobe report above n 6, 208. 91 La Trobe report above n 6, 257. Australian Natural Therapists Association 19 Negative Licensing Concern has been expressed in Australia with regard to the activities of some unregistered health professionals, including formerly registered health professionals who now practise in related fields after being suspended or deregistered. The discipline and enforcemen t provisions available under registration statutes are not available to stop some unfair, unethical, criminal and dangerous practices by a small proportion of unregistered health practitioners.92 This gap in the legislation and a number of concerning cases of unethical and dangerous acts by unregistered health practitioners led to New South Wales and later South Australia enacting a Code of Conduct for unregistered health practitioners to regulate the activities of those health workers giving powers to grant prohibition orders against their activities.93 These Codes of Conduct are a form of 'negative licensing' which means there are limited controls on entry into the industry but they provide a power to prohibit a person to practice in some practice areas or prohibit practice entirely based upon a breach o f the relevant code. A review of this issue by the Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council culminated in a decision by the COAG Health Council in April 2015 for a code of conduct for health workers (similar but not the same) as the New South Wales ex ample to be enacted in all jurisdictions in Australia.94 The implementation of this proce ss may take some time to unfold. When fully realised this process will mean that regulation similar to the New South Wales model will apply across Australia . This regul ation will include the significant remedies to apply interim or permanent prohibition orders against the practices of unregistered practitioners who are in breach of the Code of Conduct. Queensland has already enacted the National Code of Conduct for Healt h Care Workers (Queensland) reflecting the national model under Regulation 5 of the Health Ombudsman Regulation 2014 as has Victoria under the Health Complaints Act 2016 (Vic) Schedule 2. The use of this form of regul ation is welcome but it provides retrospective regulation that applies only after negative outcomes have arisen and does not provide proactive prior statutory regulation of the quality of training, education and probity of Nat/WHM /NM practitioners. 92 Wardl e, above n 56, 138. 93http://www.health.nsw.gov.au/phact/Documents/Code_of_Conduct_unregistered_health_practitioners_ - _poster_ -_2012_Regulation.pdf 94 Refer to the COAG , Final Report: A National Code of Conduct for Health Care workers (17 April 2015) in relation to the details of this proposed National Code of Conduct. http://www.coaghealthcouncil.gov.au/Announcements/ArtMID/527/ArticleID/54/Final -Report -A-National Code - of-Conduct -for-health -care -workers) Australian Natural Therapists Association 20 Fragmented Regulatory Framework The practice of Nat/WHM/NM is framed by a myriad of incoherent complex and confusing legislation and regulations at both State and Federal levels. These legi slative and regulatory measures are based upon different policy imperatives which are significant in their own right such as the Therapeutic Goods regulation or health care complaints but it is not easy to point to clear regulatory structure for the practice of Nat/WHM/NM. The La Trobe report suggests 'The present model \u2014a mixture of self -regulation and statutory requirements \u2014does not serve the public, the profession, or the industry well .95 Under The A New Tax System (Goods and Services) Act 1999 naturopaths, acup uncturists, and herbal medicine practitioners who are members of recogni sed professional associations can provide GST -free services. This is a powerful incentive for practitioners to obtain GST free status for their practice by joining a recognised associa tion. The failure of this legislation is that the membership of professional associations is based upon the varying practice standards created by the different associations. The stan dards are inconsistent with one another and do not need to have regard to standards set by other bodies. The legislative scheme does not require professional associations to have matters such as specified standards of practice, a complaints mechanism, infection control guidelines, or requirements for education and qu alification for practitioners. Rather they are only required to have \"national standards \". Many professional associations have establish ed appropriate standards in such areas, but they are not consistent and may lack the degree of professionalism required to ac hieve the desired outcome of public protection. There has been a failure to determine and require national standards amongst professional associations. The result is confusion for both practitioners and the public.96 In reality the TGA and GST exemptions ar e not aimed at a coherent regulatory struct ure but focus on the need to deal with taxa tion and risks in the provision of therapeutic goods . It does not provide a whole of profession coherent answer to the need for public protection. Statutory regulation would still require a role for Nat/WHM/NM professional associations in represent ing practitioners , supporting them in misconduct matters and the provision of advice and representing members in dealings with government but the ir role will focus on representing practitioners rather than being involve d in difficult to achieve standard professional educational standards and discipline which would then be the province of a statutory regulator. Consideration of overseas regulatory models such as that applying in the USA and Canada enacted after careful consideration, in the face of orthodox medicine opposition suggests some points that may be relevant to Australian policy development.97 The protection of the consumers is best attaine d through the development of a register of practitioners, based upon specified standards of practitioner probity and professional practice, education and training. This will assist in prospectively avoid ing adverse outcomes , but if they occur , to provide a statutory mechanism for investigating allegations of unprofessional conduct to provide a resp onse to ensure the practitioner does not repeat that behaviour and to provide lessons that can be applied generally in the regulatory structure. This is what currently applies under the National Law in Australia for health professions subject to statutory regulation. 95 La Trobe report, above n 6, 296. 96 Ibid 97 Refer to discussion below p p 32. Australian Natural Therapists Association 21 Criterion 4: Is regulation p ractical to implement for the occupation in question? When considering whether regulation of the occupation is possible, the following need s to be considered: is the occupation well defined; does the occupation have a body of knowledge that can form the basis of its standards of practice; is this body of knowledge, with the skills and abilities ne cessary to apply the knowledge, teachable and testable; where applicable, have functional competencies been defined; and do the members of the occupation require core and government accredited qualification s? WHM is well establi shed throughout Western history and can be readily understood to be the practice of herbal medicine from the traditions of Britain, Europe and North America.98 Herbal medicine pr actised in the Chinese medicine tradition is already regulated under the IGA. WHM is one of the modalities used by naturopaths and these professions have overlap ping identities and modalities. Naturopathy is an established body of knowledge and the boundaries of its practice are well defined, but because no barriers to entry exist, n aturopaths can practice any modality and still use the title. Naturopat hic modalities are also practice d as single modalities by other practitioners, WHM practitioners, hom oeopaths, massage therapists, nutritionists and lifestyle counsellors. Nutritional medicine is a more recently established health profession but the new requirement for a degree standard for education will provide an underpinning to professionali sation of this profession through the required mapping of higher degrees attributes required for this degree . Level and Na ture of Education of Nat/WHM/NM Education for Nat/WHM/NM has been offered at ter tiary level for many years in Australia. There was a broad professional agreement on core compe tencies and curriculum requirements through the adoption of the National Healt h Training Package (the minimum requirements set by the Vocational Education and Training s ector) which had the support of professional associations. The Complementary & Alternative Health (CAH) aspects of HLT07 relevant to Nat/WHM/NM were: HLT60512 Advanced Diploma of Naturopathy HLT60112 Advanced Diploma of Western Herbal Medicine HLT61012 Advanced Diploma of Nutritional Medicine It is significant that i n 2015 the next stage of the maturation of the professionali sation has arisen for Nat/WHM/NM as a bachelor degree level previously offered by a number of university and private education providers is now the required educational standard for practitione rs subject to the teach -out period that ceases in December 2018 . There had been criticism of the standard of education of the advanced diploma as it focus sed on VET standards and skill-based competencies as against the degree standard of higher education with a focus on critical analysis and independent thinking.99 98 http://www.who.int/medicines/areas/traditional/definitions/en/ 99 Wardle, above n 67, 364. Australian Natural Therapists Association 22 The La Trobe report found that in 2003 there were 47 naturopathy and WHM education providers in Australia involving 104 undergraduate and postgraduate courses.100 At that time the level of education was 47% adv anced diploma, 16% bachelor degree, 15 % diploma and certificates and 13% postgraduate awards. The first bachelor degree in naturopathy commenced in 1995 at Southern Cross University though this course been discontinued in recent years . In 2003 the market was predominantly privately owned 15 colleges (52%), four TAFE (14%) and 10 universities (34%). It was estimated at that time that 3500 students were enrolle d in naturopathy and WHM.101 The La Trobe report suggested that there was conce rn about the need to clarify minimal education standards and for education standards to be set by an indep endent body.102 It has been noted that: 'The level of education in naturopathy and WHM is evolving, but the absence of a common standard for the prepa ration of practitioners contributes to lack of recognition by mainstream institutions. Debate is required to reach agreement on minimum standards for naturopathy and WHM education programs, but attempts to improve educational standards are unlikely to succeed without the support of a regulatory system that can mandate min imum education requirements.'103 The La Trobe report suggested that courses in both naturopathy and WHM reflected a range from 2 years to 4.5 years with course contact hours (bachelor degr ees and advanced diplomas comb ined) for naturopathy were 2265 and for WHM were 1693 .104 The content focussed on science ranged from 300 hours to 930 hours in naturopathy and from 507 hours to 923 hours in WHM with clinical experience ranging from 198 hours to 800 hours in naturopathy and 100 hours to 272 hours in WHM. 97% of courses in this study were government or university accredited. Concern was expressed about aspects of curricula in regar d to the level of time spent on matters such as : clinical practice; pharmacology and interactions among herbs, nutrients, and drugs; communication, counselling, ethics, and legal issues; critical thinking and analysis; basic research methods, literature reviews, and the role of evidence -based practice in holistic healthcare; manufacture of herbal products for extemporaneous prescribing; sociology of h ealth and healthcare; core mo dalities of naturopathy and WHM; variety of forms of assessment; and input from education specialists to ensure that forms of assessment match desired outcomes with respect to subjects, co urses, and graduate attributes .105 The upgrade in the minimum required levels of education for Nat/WHM/NM would deal with many of these concerns . Advanced Diploma qualifications for the above modalities are now in teach -out phase and students enrolled in these advanced diplomas have until December 2018 to complete these courses. Students hav e not been able to enrol in Advanced Diplomas of Natu ropathy, Nutrition and WHM since D ecember 2015 when the advanced diplomas ceased. As a result of advanced diplomas ceasing the new minimum educational st andard for Naturopathy, Nutrition and WHM will become bachelor degree level. Since Dec ember 2015 people wanting to enrol in these modalities can now only enrol in bachelor degree programs.106 100 La Trobe report above n 6, 144. 101 Ibid 102 Ibid 146 103 Ibid 147 104 ibid 144 -145; Wardle, Natural Therapists Association 23 The move to bachelor degree programs has seen a rationalisation of course providers. Several course providers who delivered advanced diplomas programs have decided not to deliver bachelor degree programs probably because of the cost involved in setting up bachelor degrees , the higher standards expected of that form of education and because of stricter Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (TEQSA )107 audit and quality control over colleges who deliver them. Australian Skills Quality Authority (ASQA ), which is the VET sector regulator previously governed audits and quality control over advanced diplomas at a less stringent level . The move to bachelor degree programs has been supported by mos t associations except for ATMS (refer to discussion below) . Currently in Australia the provision of the now standard minimum level degree standard education (for four and three years) for Nat/WHM/NM includes as follows: Naturopathy Bachelor of Health Science (Naturopathy) Endeavour College of Natu ral Health - four years full time Paramou nt College of Natural Medicine - three years full time Southe rn School of Natural Therapies - four years full time Australasian College of Natural Therapies ( ACNT ) - four years full time Western Herbal Medicine Bachelor of Health Science (Western Herbal Medicine) Paramoun t College of Natural Medicine - three years full time Southe rn School of Natural Therapies - three years full time Australasian College of Natural Therapies ( ACNT ) - four years full time Nutritional Medicine Bachelor of Health Science (Nut ritional and Dietetic Medicine) Endeavo ur College of Natural Health - three years full time Queensland University of Technology (QUT) - four years full time Bachelor of Health Science (Nutritional Medicine) Paramou nt College of Natural Medicine - three years full time Southe rn School of Natural Therapies - three years full time Australasian College of Natural Therapies ( ACNT ) - four years full time Charles Sturt University , Bachelor of Healt h Science (Food and Nutrition) - (six years part time distance) Victoria University , Bachelor of Science - Nutri tion Food and Health Science - three years full time Bachelor of Human Nutrition University of Canberra - three years full time La Trobe University - three years full time 107 TEQSA is the HE statutory regulator under the discussed in more detail below. http://www.teqsa.gov.au/ . Australian Natural Therapists Association 24 The significance of the movement to a bachelor degree as the fun damental educational standard is significant as this will now mean that educational institutions will become s ubject to the stricter regulation requirements of TE QSA rather than ASQ A especially in the case of non -self- accrediting institutions108 which is 'a higher education provider that does not have responsibility for accrediting its own qualifications '. Most private colleges fall into that category . The movement towards requiring bachelor degree as the minimum educational standard derived from a review of the qualifications for CAM under the 'Complementary & Alternative Health Alignment of Qualifications to the Australian Qualif ications Framework Discussion Paper '.109 This was initiated by the Community Services & Health Industry Skills Council (CS&HISC). At the time the All Complementary & Alternative Health (CAH) qualifications in the Health Training Package (HLT07) w ere under review. Industry Reference Groups comprising representatives from all CAH modalities oversaw this work, with a smaller Subject Matter Expert Group (SMEG) for each modality. Issues arose about the appropriate alignment of CAH qualifications to the Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF) and whether for CAH the required minimum educational level s hould be adjusted to a bache lor degree level. The advanced diploma was the required educational level for Aromatic Medicine, Ayurveda, Homoeopathy, Nat uropathy, Nutritional Medicine and Western Herbal Medicin e. The paper suggested :110 'This paper has been developed based on a range of discussion and comments, including: the need for substantial additional and more clearly articulated anatomy, physiology, pathophysiology and pharmacology content - especially in the advanced diploma qualifications (with some impact on Certificate IV and diploma qualifications also) questions around what the actual difference is between advanced diploma and bachelor degree the amount of learning required to achieve the qualification outcomes (e.g. views that advanced diploma outcomes not able to be achieved in less than 3 years for some modalities) tacit acknowledgment and / or open discussion that a degree level qualifica tion either is, should be, or will be in the near future, the qualification required to practice.' The paper then mapped the learning outcomes required by AQF levels for advanced diploma and bachelor degree and the knowledge and skills needs of practitioners in CAH. It was noted that issues such as professional p ractice; accountability for own learning and volum e of learning for degree at three years were significant requirements for the bachelor degree level.111 The paper then asked for feedback on the issue of whether the educational level should now be at the bachelor level for CAH. After receiving feedback , in November 2014 by a unanimous recommendation of the Training Package Advisory Committee and the CS&HISC Board it was decided to remove the Advanced Diplomas of Hom oeopathy, Naturopathy, Nutritional Medicine 108 Australian Qualifications Framework Council, Australian Qualifications Framework , (Second Edition January 2013) p100 . 109 Community Services & Health Industry Skills Council, Complementary & Alternative Health Alignment of Qualifications to the Australian Qualifications Framework Discussion Paper: October , 2013 . 110 Ibid p 4 111 Ibid pp 6 -10 Australian Natural Therapists Association 25 and Western Herbal Medicine from the Health Trai ning Package in December 2015 with no extension.112 This change in educational standard is significant as the clear intention was to focus the educational outcomes and training on the issue of professional practice, greater focus on anatomy, physiology, path ophysiology and pharmacology, increased volume of learning and with initiative and judgment in planning, problem solving and decision making in professional practice and/or scholarship and working in an independent professional practice context.113 Practitioners are currently not obliged to upgrade to bachelor degree level qualifications but over time this professional transition will to a large measure occur based upon a number of factors. For example, c urrent members of ANTA and most likely other p rofessional associations with only the advanced diploma qualification who have continuous membership and comply with health fund provider requirements will continue as members and as providers with health funds.114 It is expected that the health funds will be updating educational requirements for naturopathy, western herbal medicine , homoeopathy and nutrition to bachelor level so this change will directly impact on new entries into the profession and practitioners w ho were former members of a professional association and seek renewed membership or after a gap in health fund accreditation.115 Significance of adoption of bachelor level educational standard A useful discussion is provided by Australian Natural Therapists Association Ltd116 in regard to the different educational standards that will apply under the newly introduced bachelor degree standard as against the standard specified under the Advanced Diploma , the differences are clear based upon the AQF spec ifications .117 Under the Advanced Diploma (AQF Level 6) the expectations of graduate outcomes are: 'Knowledge: Graduates at this level will have broad theoretical and technical knowledge of a specific area or a broad field of work and learning. Skills: Graduates at this level will have a broad range of cognitive, technical and communication skills to select and apply methods and technologies to: analyse information to complete a range of activities interpret and transmit solutions to unpredictable and s ometimes complex problems transmit information and skills to others Application of knowledge and skills : Graduates at this level will apply knowledge and skills demonstrat ing autonomy, judgment and defined and defined r esponsibility: In contexts that are subject to change Within broad parameters to provide specialist advice and functions ' 112 http://www.cshisc.com.au/develop/industry -qualifications -training -packages/qualifications -under - review/complementary -alternative -health/ 113 Community Services & Health Industry Skills Council, above n 5, 6 -10. 114 Brian Coleman, ' Executive Officer Report' March (2016) 31 The Natural Therapist 5. 115 Ibid 12 116 ANTA, Submission to Community Services & Health Industry Skills Council on Complementary & Alternative Health Alignment of Qualifications to the Australian Qualifications Framework 26th November 2013 pp 4 -6 117 Australian Qualifications Framework (second edition January 2013) 41, 42. Australian Natural Therapists Association 26 Under the Bachelor Degree (AQF Level 7 ) the expectations of graduate outcomes are:118 'Knowledge: Graduates at this level will have broad and coherent theoretical and technical knowledge with depth in one or more disciplines or areas of practice. Skills : Graduates at this level will have well -developed cognitive, technical and communica tion skills to select and apply methods and technologies to: Analyse and evaluate i nformation to complete a range of activities Analyse, generate and transmit solutions to unpredictable and sometimes complex problems Transmit knowledge, skills and ideas to others Application of Knowledge and Skills: Graduates at this level will apply k nowledge and skills to demonstrate autonomy, well developed judgement and responsibility: in contexts that require self -directed work and learning within broad parameters to provide specialist advice and functions ' The ANTA submission suggests that :119 'as many natural therapists are increasingly regarded and utilised by the public as primary health care service providers, there is a growing requirement for practitioners to act as independent professionals or specialists and demonstrate in depth theoretica l and technical knowledge as well as critical thinking, assessment and diagnosis skills. The Advance Diploma AQF Level 6 qualifications has served the natural therapy profession well for a significant period of tim e, however, in order to achieve continuous quality improvement and meet public expectations, ANTA supports the alignment of natural therapy qualifications to bachelor degree AQF Level 7. ' A comparison of the key information outlined above in relation to advanced diploma and bachelor degree qualifications suggests that industry and also public expectations are more aligned with bachelor degree knowledge and skills requirements .120 'Public and industry expectations now require natural therapy practitioners to :121 have skills to exercise critical thinking and problem solving have skills to critically review and analyse information and knowledge have the knowledge and ability to act independently be able to adapt knowledge and skills in diverse contexts The above attributes are typically f ound in bachelor degree programs. ' 118 Ibid, 47, 48. 119 ANTA submission, above n 117, 6, 120 Ibid 121 Ibid Australian Natural Therapists Association 27 Higher Education Regulation As the basic level of education for Nat/WHM/NM will now be in the higher education space , the regulator of the educators and the quality of cours es will be TEQSA which is Australia's independent national regulator of the higher education sector. TEQSA is an independent statutory agency .122 TEQSA indicate s that its role and impact on the higher education is based upon the need to :123 'safeguard the interests of all current and future students studying within Australia's higher education system. It does this by regulating and assuring the quality of Australia's higher education providers. TEQSA is responsible for the registration and re -registration of providers and the accreditation an d re-accreditation of courses'. TEQSA's regulatory approach is standards and risk -based. It is guided by three regulatory principles - regulatory necessity, reflecting risk and proportionate regulation, when exercising its powers. Standards based regulation :124 'provider entry to and continued operations within Australia's higher education sector are determined by demonstrated compliance with the Higher Education Standards Framework (Threshold Standards) the standards are developed and promulgated independently of TEQSA by the Higher Education Standards Panel the standards apply to all providers, offering courses leading to a regulated higher education award, irrespective of where and how a course is delivered while all providers must demonstrate adherence to the Thresho ld Standards, TEQSA assess es these in the context of each provider's circumstances the standards are applied flexibly and with regard to the diversity of teaching methods and delivery modes that exist and are emerging within the sector. The standards are n ot intended, or applied, to limit higher achievement '. Education providers offering a bachelor degree will need to satisfy the Higher Education Standards Framework (Threshold Standards) including the profession specific obligations in relation to Learning Outcomes and Assessment clause 1.4 (set out in Schedule B to this submission ) including knowledge and skills that characterise the field of education or disciplines involved, knowledge and skills required for employment; skills in ind ependent and critical thinking suitable for life -long learning. 122 http://www.teqsa.gov.au/ 123 http://www.teqsa.gov.au/regulatory -approach 124 http://www.teqsa.gov.au/regulatory -approach Australian Natural Therapists Association 28 Risk -based Regulation 'TEQSA's risk-based approach ensures that resources are directed to areas of higher risk based on validated, qualit y intelligence about a provider. Key aspects of this approach include the Higher Education Standards Framework , the Case Manager model, the Agency's Regulatory Risk Framework , the use of experts and engagement with professional bodies .'125 This means that any higher education providers of Nat/WHM/NM are subject to TEQSA oversight and the standards required by all higher education providers. In the case of universities which are sel f-accrediting institutions their regulation is more light touch while in the case of non-university institutions such as private colleges , these are generally non self -accrediting institutions which are subject to greater scrutiny by TESQA includin g reviewing and approving courses and programs, applying performance conditions to approvals during a specified accreditation period which may relate the specific degrees or courses .126 In regard to higher education providers for Nat/WHM/NM the heightened supervision by TE QSA against the training for industry approach of ASQA will mean that that their activities will be monitored for quality and educational outcomes at a higher standard of professional practice . Research The provision of Nat/WHM/NM has a well-developed and rapidly burgeoning body of knowledge that can form the basis of its standards of practice . This is reflected in the amount of funded Nat/WHM/NM research currently being undertaken by the high er education sector in Australia . Funding for research into CAM including Nat/WHM/NM comes from both the government and private funding sources .127 The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) prompted by reports about th e use of treatments, including CAM , without an adequate evidence basis to treat chronic, or serious medical conditions has placed a greater focus on this issue .128 The increasing interest by regulators in CAM is reflected in the inclusion in the 'NHMRC Strategic Plan 2010 -2012, of 'examining alternative therapy c laims' as a major health issue for consideration by the organisation, including the provision of research funding. In the current Strategic Plan 2013 -2015, NHMRC has broadened its focus to investigate the general issue of 'Claiming benefits for human healt h not based on evidence'.' 'With regard to CAM, NHMRC is undertaking a number of activities that align with its commitment outlined in its Strategic Plan 2013 -2015 with the aim of assisting Australians in making informed decisions about their health care. This includes consideration of the potential benefits and risks of each option using the available evidence. Current activities include:129 Developing a resource for clinicians to facilitate discussion with patients regarding their use of CAM. Continuing to increase knowledge through the funding of investigator -driven research on CAM through NHMRC's competitive, peer -reviewed grant application processes. Reviewing the effectiveness of a range of CAM using established methods for identifying and assessing evidence. ' 125 http://www.teqsa.gov.au/regulatory -appro Natural Therapists Association 29 NHMRC, under the guidance of the Health Care Committee, has developed a resource for clinicians to facilitate discussion with patients regarding their use of C AM. A notable research institute in Australia on issu es relevant to Nat/WHM/NM is The National Institute of Complementary Medicine at Western Sydney University .130 The Institute's website indica tes it is active in clinical trials, publications , provision of scholarships, international collaborations and continuing professional development. The Institute has benefited from millions of dollars of research funding from industry and benefactors.131 In 2014 , La Trobe University entered into Memora ndum of Unders tanding with Swiss e Wellness. Chief Executive Officer Radek Sali has confirmed that the company will be the founding partner, contributing $15 million over six years towards the commissioned research activities an d establishment of the La Trobe Complementa ry Medicine Evidence Centre (CMEC).132 Another significant research centre involved in research in regard to CAM which includes Nat/WHM/NM is the Australian Research Centre in Complementary and Integrative Medicine (ARCCIM) at the Faculty of Health , University of Technology, Sydney .133 ARCCIM states: 'it is the world -leading critical public health research centre focusing on complementary and integrative health care. The scientific investig ation of complementary and integrative medicine is paramount when addressing contemporary health systems and global health challenges. At ARCCIM, we believe this requires a synergy of critical perspectives, genuine collaboration and a commitment to produce meaningful insights. ' ARCCIM suggests it has been involved in the following research achiev ements:134 '$11 million in external competitive grant funding, including 18 grants funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council and Australian Research Council 5 prestigious government -funded (NHMRC and ARC) Research Fellowships $3.5 artnership funding authoring 700+ peer -reviewed publications, including 11 research books with prestigious international publishing houses the largest concentration of PhD students focused upon complementary and integrative health care in Australia. ' ARCC IM is the first centre worldwide dedicated to conducting and promoting critical CAM research via a wide range of established methods and perspectives from public health and health services research . There has been criticism of the lack of research outputs from private colleges .135 One study it suggested there was dominance by public universities in CAM related research outputs and a lack of commitment to building research capacity with a drop of f in research by researchers after commencing teaching at a priva te college.136 The Endea vour College of Natural Wardle, above n 67, 366, 367. 136 J Wardle, above n 67, 364. Australian Natural Therapists Association 30 the last two years established an Office of Research including a research committee, a research ethics committee and has funded internally and externally research projects on Nat/WHM/NM and has commenced a collaborative partnership with the ARCCIM . 137 Some major professional associations provide funding or access to participants for research proje cts by researchers as part of their day-to-day function.138 ANTA provides to its members free access to scientific resources including ESBCO Host , eMIMS , IMgateway and iTherapeutics.139 Institutional Recognition Private Health Funds The increasing popularity of Nat/WHM/NM has resulted in responses from many government and private sector organi sations including health insurance , professional indemnity insurers , ATO, higher education and NHMRC . Many health insurance companies provide rebates on health practitioner fees for Nat/WHM/NM. Based upon the ANTA website140 which regularly provides an update of health insurance rebates the following health insurers provide rebates for the provision of Nat/WH M/NM modalities namely: Nutrition - Australian Health Management , Australian Unity, CBHS Health Fund, GMF Health, GU Health, HBF, HCF, Medibank Private, NIB Naturopathy - 36 Health Funds Western Herbal Medicine - 24 Health Funds This indicates a broad acceptance of the role of Nat/WHM/NM in the provision of health care in Australia. In the absence of registration status for Nat/WHM/NM it is necessary for the health funds to provide a process to establish the credentials of Nat/WHM /NM practitioners to ensure they are appropriately qualified. Under the Private Health Insurance (Accreditation) Rules 2011 there are specific requirements before a health practitioner can offer a rebate to clients for their services under the private heal th insurance policy based upon the terms of each policy. Treatment provided by complementary medicine practitioners is only eligible for coverage by private health insurance if the practitioner is duly registered such as applies to chiropractic, osteopathy and Chinese Medicine for the treatment conte mplated by that registration. For other unregistered complementary medicine practitioners to be eligible for private health rebates they must be a member of a national professional association which assesses the training and education qualifications of members; the professional association must conduct a compulsory professional development scheme for members; it must have an enforced code of conduct and a formal disciplinary procedure to suspend or expel members and an appropriate complaints procedure.141 In addition , any State or Territory premises legislative requirements must be satisfied.142 137 http://www.endeavour.edu.au/research/office -of-research 138 ANTA http://www.australiannaturaltherapistsassociation.com.au/resources/ebscohost.php . Refer to Schedule C page 62, 64. 139 http://www.australiannaturaltherapistsassociatio n.com.au/resources/ebscoho Refer to Schedule C pp 55. 140 http://www.australiannaturaltherapistsassociation.com.au/resources/healthfundlist.php 141 Private Health Insurance (Accreditation) Rules 2011 clause 10. 142 Ibid clause 11. Australian Natural Therapists Association 31 Most private health insurer s have additional requirements before recognising a complementary medicine practitioner as eligible for the health fund rebate for clients. These requirements normally relate to having suitable professional indemnity insurance, requirements about keeping good re cords, demonstrated participation in continuing professional education, the ability to lodge information electronically and the practitioner having a current first aid certificate. Not all health insurance companies cover complementary medicine and those t hat do cover these services do not cover all modalities. This suggests that as the access to health insurance rebates is a significant financial issue for practitioners that the control over access to health rebates applied by health funds is an aspect of the regulatory control over the practice of Nat/WHM/NM.143 No doubt the move to bachelor degree status will result in a review of the required educational standards for eligibility for health rebates after a period of grand parenting. It is still possible to practice and hold out as a Nat/WHM/NM practitioner without access to health fund rebates. Worker Compensation Insurance There is limited access to the benefits provided by Work Cover for the provision of Nat/WHM/NM in some jurisdictions normally focussed on the potential for the provision of remedial physical therapies. Nat/WHM/NM is not specifically mentioned in workers compensation legislation though in South Australia there is provision for treatment by remedial physical therapies .144 Profe ssional Indemn ity Insurance A number of insurance providers provide profe ssional indemnity insurance for Nat/WHM/NM practitioners. It is possible for individual practitioners to approach a professional indemnity insurance company individually but most major professional associations have a negotiated indemnity arrangement with an insurance company which accepts the standard of education and training required for membership of the professional association as sufficient for acceptanc e of the practitioner. All major professional associations require professional indemnity insurance as a condition of membership. Some of the professional indemnity insurance companies are: Therapy S ure145 Arthur J Gallagher146 BizCover147 Fenton Green148 If there was a national standard for education this would likely reduce the time necessary for underwriters to be satisfied about the quality of education of practitioners .149 143 The details of the educationa l and training requirements for accreditation for health funds is outlined : -practitioners.php 149 La Trobe report, above n 6, 208. Australian Natural Therapists Association 32 Conclusion , Criterion 4 Nat/WHM/NM are defined professions, with understood modalities involving now a higher education level for normal acceptance into the profession. Many other institutions and bodies such as the ATO, health funds and professional indemnity insurers are prepared to regu late or endorse the practice o f Nat/WHM/NM. This suggests that there is a secure basis to implement regulation. There are complexities in relation to naturopathy \u2014because of the diversity of practices adopted by the profession and the fact that practitioners ca n specialise in some modal ities while not practising others but this can be dealt with by the manner in which any regulatory system is designed. Although practitioners are currently permitted to access health fund rebates for the benefit of clients, professional indemnity insurance for their and their c lients protection and GST discounts for lower costs to consumers the regulatory structure Nat/WH M/NM may be subject to change or exclusion as time proceeds. A much more solid basis for the continuation of high quality Nat/WHM/NM and the protection of cons umers is through statutory regulation. Criterion 5: Is regulation practical to implement for the occupation in question? When considering whether regulation of the occupation is practical the following should be considered: are self -regulation and/or other alternatives to registration practical to implement in relation to the occupation in question; does the occupational leadership tend to favour the public interest over occupation self - interest; is there a likelihood that members o f the occupation will be organised and seek compliance with regulation from their members; are there sufficient numbers in the occupation and are those people willing to contribute to the costs of statutory regulation; is there an issue of cost recovery in regulation; and do all State Governments agree with the proposal for regulation. Size of Nat/WHM/NM profession There are many Nat/WHM/NM practitioners in Australia (in excess of 10,000) according to one source.150 As indicated above , CAM practitioners provide a significant part of the provision of health care in Australia. Generally (though not all) Nat/WHM/NM practitioners and their professional associations favour statutory regulation. ANTA, founded in 1955 is the largest national democratic associa tion of 'recognised professional' traditional medicine and natural therapy practitioners (including a large percentage of Nat/WHM/NM practitioners) who work in the areas of health care and preventive medicine. The full profile of ANTA is found at Schedule C of this submission. 150 Above n 19 , 3. Australian Natural Therapists Association 33 Professional Associations Most professional associations favour statutory registration for Nat/WHM/NM. The ANPA ,151 Complementary Medicines Australia ,152 and ANTA strongly support statutory registration.153 By contrast Australian Traditional Medicine Society (ATMS) does not support statutory regulation.154 It is stated on its website that: 'ATMS adopted the self -regulation model, later to become the Co -Regulation model. This was opposed to the Statutory Registration model that was so ught by TCM. It was felt this model was not appropriate for the occupations that fall under the umbrella of natural medicine. Regulation of the occupations has always been a major point of difference between ANTA, NHAA and ATMS, the former supporting statutory registration, ATMS never wavering from the opposite view.'155 International Models of Regulation Practitioners of naturopathy are recognised and regulated in many other jurisdictions notably in various states of the United States including Alaska , Arizona , California , Colorado , Connecticut , Maine Maryland , Minnesota Montana New , North Dakota, Oregon , Utah , Vermont , Washington ; and United States Territories: Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands .156 In Canada , five provinces register naturopaths namely Ontario , British Columbia , Manitoba , Saskatchewan , and Alberta .157 Chinese Medicine (including Chinese herbal medicine and acupuncture) has been successfu lly regulated in Victoria since 2000 and now nationally since 2011 under the National Law (which is the legislation created pursuant to the IGA for a national registration scheme for a number of health professionals including Chinese Medicine incorporating a national registration board for each regulated health profession ) under the auspices of the Chinese Medicine Board of Australia . These examples demonstrate the practicali ty of implementing occupational regulation for CAM generally and Nat/WHM/NM specifically . Chinese Medicine Model in Australia For Chinese Medicine , protected titles under the National Law are Chinese medicine practitioner, Chinese herbal dispenser, Chinese herbal medicine practitioner, Oriental medicine practitioner, and acupuncturist. For the Chinese Medicine Registration Board of V ictoria and now under the national board , there have been practical challenges in the normal issues involved in professionali sation . These include the limits of 'grand parenting' practitioners who may seek to obtain registration based on clinical experience; setting the appropriate standar ds for education including learning outcomes ; educating the profession, private health funds, and the public about th e role of the board . In addition , it is necessary to align standards for practice with other registratio n boards to ensure this regulation deals with national standards of practice and 151 to profile Schedule C below, 61. 154 http://www.atms.com.au/ 155 http://www.atms.com.au/page.php?id=26 156 American Association of Naturopathic Physicians http://www.naturopathic.org/content.asp?contentid=57 (accessed 1 May 2016) 157 Wardle, above n 43, 84 -85; Canadian Association of Naturopathic Doctors https://www.cand.ca/Professional_Affiliations.professional.0.html (accessed 1 May 2016) Australian Natural Therapists Association 34 the costs of regulation in terms of the impact on practitioner and governmental costs of regulation .158 It is likely that similar practical issues will emerge for Nat/WHM/NM should statutory regulation be undertaken, but the problems are not insurmou ntable. I t is likely the number of Nat/WHM/NM potential registrants could be expected to be higher than for Chinese Medicine . This may reduce the cost to government of regulation and for pr actitioners based upon the greater numbers of practitioner providing registration fees. In addition , some of the cost of dealing with the evidence of training and education from overseas institutions in a foreign language as well as the difficulties of cu ltural fit may be less problematic . The major practical issue is the question of how to defi ne the professions. It is clear that each of Nat/WHM/NM are definable practice s and a definable prof ession but in terms of what Nat/WHM/NM practitioners do on a daily basis is more difficult as it includes an eclectic range of practices some of which might be considered 'risky' (involving ingestive substances) and 'non-risky' (massage or dietary advise) . Herbal medicine is, however, a core pr actice for naturopaths and nutritional medi cine is a second core practice. Another practical difficulty occurs due to the multiplicity o f titles used by practitioners.159 At present, Nat/WHM/NM practitioners in the context of where there are no protected tit les any practitioner even one with limited training and education can use generic professional titles (such as natural therapist) or in terms of the individual modalities that they offer. If titles do become protected for Nat/WHM/NM , a designated generic and/or specific title will need to be determined . The se protected titles might conflict with some of the titles currently being used by practitioners who may be unable to become registered for reasons of lack of education or clinical experience . This will also impact on education providers, professional associations, private health funds, and taxation authorities (under the GST exemption legislation). Although this is an issue , it was dealt under the regulation of Chinese M edicine and will no doubt result in a rationali sation of the marketplace for some non -registered practition ers. Any registration b oard for Nat/WHM/NM will need to make informed , responsible and evidenced based decision s about what titles should be restricted focussing on the public interest which is the primary focus of this regulation.160 The La Trobe report s suggests many CAM practitioners use the title 'naturopath' when applying modalities such as herbal medicine, nutritional medicine , homoeopathy, tactile therapies, and lifestyle counselling.161 Currently practitioners can use the title of 'naturopath' if they are one or several of these modalities . If a statutory restricted title protection w as established for WHM practitioners only, naturopaths practising herbal medi cine may avoid this statutory mechanism . If a statutory restricted title 'naturopath' only was applied this would mean that naturopaths using modalities such as nutritional medicine and homoeopathy would be forced to choose between regist ration and not using the title. Depending on the restricted title applied by statute some practitioners might attempt to adopt other related terms such as .' Some practitioners might be refused registration (or not seek registration) on the basis they do not comply with educational and training requirements . The se might continue to practise under alternative titles \u2014including the potentially confusing title of ' natural therapist' if that is not a restricted title .162 158 La Trobe report above n 6, 299 -302. 159 Ibid 301 160 Ibid 161 Ibid 162 Ibid Australian Natural Therapists Association 35 Summary of Level of support for or against Occupational Regulation: Concerns have been expressed no doubt by practitioners who were wary that 'statutory regulation would result in the 'medicalisation' of naturopathy including '(i) subordination to medical doctors; (ii) the effect on practice of a highly regulated environment; (iii) increased patient volume; (iv) less time with patients; (v) less individualised care; and (vi) violation of practice philosophy and stronger regulation is likely to introduce a degree of standardisation .'163 The La Trobe report suggest ed support for statutory registration from a number of stakeholders based upon :164 consumer focus group responses . The GP survey participants from the La Trobe report suggested support for government regulation of herbal medicine and naturopathy, most likely to deal with the perceived risk of injury caused by limitations on prac titioner education and training . The majority of naturopaths and WHM practitioners generally having a positive view of government regulation and support for greater regulation of their profession . These conclusions are consistent with circumstances that now apply in Australia based upon recent data and is reflective of the development in the research strength in universities in developing a research basis for the provision of Nat/WHM/NM, the significant profession wide support for the bachelor degree level of education and a n expressed desire from many professional associations and other practitioner bodies to protect the well-being of clients through statutory regulation discussed above . Criterion 6: Do the benefits to the public of regulation clearly outweigh the potential negative impact of such regulation ?165 Benefits: The move to statutory regulation would permit by statute under the National Law access to an objective transparent and accountable system for managing complaints and professional misconduct (including access to an appeals process) which will involve community and practitioner representatives with statutory backing for determinations made including fines, conditions of prac tice, further education , suspension and exclusion primarily focussed on public interest considerations.166 As is revealed by the GP survey discussed in t he La Trobe report , a major issue appears to be a lack of preparedness to refer to orthodox medicine.167 The use of statutory regulation is likely to result in i mproved qualit y and safety in healthcare as a result of bett er 163 La Trobe report, above n 6, 301; Jon Wardle, 'The National Registration and Accreditation Scheme : what would inclusion mean for naturopathy and Western Herbal Medicine', (2010) 22 (4) Australian Journal of Medical Herbalism 113, 114. 164 La Trobe report, ibid. 165 La Trobe report, above 6, 303. 166 For example under Health Practitioner Regulation National Law Act 2009 (Qld) ss 155, 191 and 196 167 La Trobe report above n 6, 7, 303. Australian Natural Therapists Association 36 communication and referral among qualified practitioners including orthodox medicine practitioners who will both share the status of bei ng registered health practitioners.168 The greater level of scrutiny by a well -resourced regulatory body and the role of AHPRA is likely to result in b etter information and protection for consumers . The qualification for registration will require the imp osition of i mproved and co nsistent standards of education which will include policies, guidelines and requirements provided by the relevant registration board which will result in better quality assurance processes and foster greater research in the moda lity for the benefit of consumer safety.169 Better assuranc e for insurers and employers of appropriate standards of training of practitioners leading to better public safety outcomes . The use of registration of Nat/WHM/NM will tend to support community confidence in the professions and enhanced status for practitioners .170 Statutory regulation will support the process of integrating complementary and alternative healt hcare practices into the health system . Statutory regulation will result in increased collaborations between public hospitals, universities and government institutions and private sector heath providers , educators and professional associations in the health and education sectors . Statutory regulation will result in decreased admi nistrative burden for funds and insurers as the standards of training and education will be clarified and standardised w ith efficiencies that may lead to lower costs for funds and insurers.171 Statutorily enforced c ompulsory prof essional indemnity insurance will protect patients from the financial consequences of negligent practice when injuries occur.172 Negative Impacts Many of these potential negative impacts are natural consequences of limiting registration to only those pract itioners who comply with registration standards. The p otential increase in fees for practitioners ( including registration costs and in addition membership of professional association s) may mean higher fees charged to consumers .173 Increased restrictions to entry to practice of the profession which may result in a lessening of competition in the marketplace which may result in higher fees.174 Statutory regulation may increase costs for some educational institutions to upgrade courses which may result in higher fees for students .175 168 Ibid 13 169 Ibid 170 Ibid 303 171 Ibid 172 Ibid 173 Ibid 174 Ibid 175 Ibid Australian Natural Therapists Association 37 Statutory regulation may result in a loss (or diminution) of income for practitioners precluded from registration who are not able to use grand parenting provisions.176 Statutory regulation may in due course mean loss of GST -free status for non-registrants.177 Statutory regulation may require practitioners to fund what may be required to upgrade qualifications to achieve registration .178 Statutory regulation may result in l oss of market share or closure for educational institutions unable to upgrade to meet higher standards .179 The benefits of promoting public safety clearly outweigh the potential negative impacts of occupational regulation.180 Overall assessment against IGA Criteria The data above dealing with the extent of involvement of CAM in the health sector shows that the use of CAM is wides pread .181 This submission concludes that :182 the regulation of Nat/WHM/NM is within the appropriate responsibility of health ministers; evidence suggests some Nat/WHM/NM practices pose a significant risk of harm and the risks are compounded by the primary healthcare context and the broad scope of practice; existing regulatory mechanisms are inadequate for safeguarding and protecting consu mers of Nat/WHM/NM ; there are definable modali ties within Nat/WHM/NM such that it is possible to implement a form of statutory regulation as discussed in this submission ; there will be some practical challenges for statutory regulation, but lessons can be drawn from overseas experience and the Victorian and national statutory regulation of Chinese Medicine in Australia ; and the benefits of protecting public safety through statutory regulation does outweigh the potential negative impacts . Options for Regulatory Models There may be six general models for the regulation of the health workforce :183 176 Ibid 177 Ibid 178 Ibid 179 Ibid 180 La Trobe report, above n 6 , 302. 181 Charlie C Xue et al, 'Complementary and Alternative Medicine Use in Australia: A National Population -Based Survey' [2007] (July -August) 13 (6) Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine 643, 643; Jon Wardle et al, above n 16, 199. 182 La Trobe report, above n 6 , 304. 183 Ibid 304 Australian Natural Therapists Association 38 Self-regulation -membership of a professional association could provide evidence that the practitioner has suitable qualifications , is safe to practise and is subject to a disciplinary scheme to deal with unethical or unprofessional practice . Negative licensing - a practitioner may enter and practise a self -regulated profession unless the practitioner is shown to have breache d the provisions of a code of conduct making the practitioner ineligible or limited in their ability to practise by order of the regulator. Co-regulation - members of a professional as sociation are regulated by an association with government involvement . Reservation of title only - a statutory registration board registers members of a profession and reserves the use of restricted titles for registrants only . Reservation of title and core practices - certain procedures considered to be high risk normally applied in the practice of a profession are by statute restricted to registrants and other specified registered health professions. Reservation of title and whole practice restriction - this model restricts the use of restricted titles, within the defined scope of pract ice of a profession, and prohibits non registrants from practising the profession. Self-Regulation184 The model of self-regulation assumes that the industry normally through professional association membership has appropriate mechanism s and financial capacity to monitor and discipline members of the profession. Nat/WHM/NM is self-regulated at present though the level of regulation is limited . Although the acceptance that the minimal educational standard allowing entry into the profession will now be at bachelor degree level even this substantial upgrade of this standard will be to some extent stymied by the continuation of professional associations which have wide variat ions in educational levels among practitioners based upon historical circumstances . This situation will not change for many years as the grand parenting of these new standards will take many years to fully impact on the market meanwhile allowing pract itioners to practice with some of the TG A exemptions and health fund rebates though that will become more difficult as time goes on as the transition to a bachelor degre e standard profession continues . 184 Ibid Australian Natural Therapists Association 39 Co-Regulation Co-regulation, a form of government monitored self -regula tion, has been proposed by some professional associations within the sector in particular ATMS . Under such a model, there would be government al oversight of mechanisms and procedures.185 This would most likely require the government ei ther to monitor numerous bodies or facilitat e the establishment of a single regulatory authority separate from profess ional associations . This may become an intrusive process and could involve high transaction costs which may be borne by taxpayers .186 Negative Licensing The La Trobe report187 'found no evidence that negative licensing has been a pplied in Australia in relation to regulation of the professions. It would limit regulation to thos e identified as failing to meet certain standards of professional conduct or educat ion. I n this context, there have been instances of deregistered health practitioners continuing to practise, using the title of naturopathy or WHM. A system of negative licensin g could offer protection to the community against such behav iour. This mechanis m could co -exist with other forms of health practitioner regulation. However, issues of civil liberty do arise in any such system. ' Since the La Trobe report , there have been substantial initiatives in the form of regulation as discussed and culminating in the proposal for a National Code of Conduct for Health Care Workers. Queensland has already enacted the National Code of Conduct for Health Care Workers (Queensland) reflecting the national model under Regulation 5 of the H ealth Ombudsman Regulation 2014 as has Victoria under the Health Complaints Act 2016 (Vic) Schedule 2. The Code is a form of negative licensing which: 'sits on a contin uum of regulations between self -regulation and statutory regulations. It is more target ed, less restrictive and is a less costly form of regulation than statutory regulation, since it provides the regulatory tools to deal directly with those who behave illegally or in an incompetent, exploitative or predatory manner and, if necessary prohibi t them from practicing. It leaves the vast majority of ethical and competent members of an unregistered health profession to self -regulate, but provides an additional level of public protection with respect to unregistered practitioners, at minimal cost to the community.'188 This form of regulation means that there are few limitations on persons entering the profession but if the activity of the practitioner is deemed to breach a code of conduct there is provision for conditions to be applied to that practit ioner's practice or for a suspension or prohibition order in relation to their practice. This form of regulation does not impose substantial regulatory costs upon practitioners if they co mply with the Code while allowing a disqualification for specified attributes, events or offences.189 This allows the enforcement of a minimum standard of practice without the cost of a statutory registration board.190 Those who are shown to not be fit to provide health services can be prevented from doing so. In this way rogue practitioners can be controlled 185 Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council, Final Report, Options for Regulation of Unregistered Health Practitioners , April 2013, 19. 186 La Trobe report above n 6, 305 187 Ibid 188 Australian Health Ministers Advisory Co uncil, Final Report, Options for Regulation of Unregistered Health Practitioners , April 2013, 24 -25. 189 Ibid 190 Ibid, 31; Arie Freiburg, The Tools of Regulation (The Federation Press, 2010) , 151. Australian Natural Therapists Association 40 without a substantial cost to the community.191 From a regulatory perspective , one limitation of this type of regulation is that the regulation is reactive , not proactive , as the remedies will only be available when a breach of the code of conduct has occurred , which may mean that a negative outcome has already arisen .192 Statutory Regulation The following models are all forms of statutory regulation Reservation of title only ; Reservation of title and core practices; Reservation of title and whole practice restriction. The focus under the National Law has been away from any regulation involving a whole of practice restriction and a reservation of title that was up until the 1990s the normal model for the regulation of health professions in Australia. Since the Competitio n Policy Review, the role of the state in regulating professions was questioned owing to its potential to create anti - competitive outcomes. Statutory regulation with reservation of title only was considered by the La Trobe report to be the most practical option for Nat/WHM/NM . Statutory regulation is a well-established model for healt h professions across Australia. The legislative frameworks and operational arrangements used in other health professions can be readily adapted and applied to Nat/WHM/NM \u2014as has already been done in the case of Chinese Medicine. The current National Registration and Accreditation Scheme for the Health Professions (NRASHP) framework also repres ents a form of co -regulation in that it is a co -operative arrangement between government and profession. A Nat/WHM/NM board could be integrated wit h existing boards (for example, the Chinese Medicine Registration Board) to improve efficien cy of operation and reduce the cost to government and registrants . The use of a reservatio n of title only would appear to be the most cost effective and appropriate f orm of statutory regulation for Nat/WHM/NM . 191 Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council, ibid. 192 Freiburg, above n 192, 150. Australian Natural Therapists Association 41 Conclusion and Recommendations In considering the application of the IGA criteria for hea lth workforce regulation to the current state of Nat/WHM/NM practice within Australia, it is concluded that a negative licensing model currently becoming a national Code of Conduct is a useful regulatory mechanism . It prevent s those practitioners who engage in seriously unethical or ill egal conduct from continuing to practice or practising without scrutiny but it does not protect from clearly unethical and untrained practitioners from entering the workforce . Statutory regulat ion is desirable and warranted for the following reasons :193 there is a lev el of risk in naturopathy and Nat/WHM/NM comparable to other regulated professions; there is a particular risk related to interaction of herbal medicine and pharmaceutical drugs and the need for appropriate prescribing frameworks; existing re gulatory frameworks are insufficient to protect against professional misconduct . 'It is actually the public who are extended the right to accessible naturopathic and western herbal medicine services and they also have the right to be assured that these practitioners are bound by minimum standards of practice and training, or be easily able to make an informed choice based on these factors. Regulation is about the patient, not the practitioner.'194 193 La Trobe report, above n 6 , 305 . 194 Jon Wardle, above n 18, 113,114.
