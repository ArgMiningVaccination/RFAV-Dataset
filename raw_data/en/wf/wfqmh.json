The school held a similar event early this year for Emory Trustee Emeritus Jimmy Williams, who donned his own white coat during the dedica- tion of the James B. Williams Medical Education Building. It is a fitting tribute. The retired president and CEO of SunTrust Banks devoted 35 years of service to Emory's Board of Trust- ees, the university, and the Woodruff Health Sciences Center Board, which governs the medical school. After graduating from Emory College in 1955 , Mr. Wil- liams joined Trust Company of Georgia and rose to become president. In 1979 , legendary Coca-Cola leader Robert Wood- ruff asked him to chair Emory's capital campaign, which had just received $105 million from the Emily and Ernest Wood- ruff Foundation, then the largest gift ever to an educational institution. Thus, Mr. Williams served Emory during a remarkable period of growth. He counseled Emory on its expansion in health care. He encouraged growth in biomedical research with construction of the O. Wayne Rollins Re- search Center, the Emory Vaccine Center, and the Neurosciences Center. In 1996 , he became founding chair of the Woodruff Fund Inc., which enabled construction of the Whitehead Biomedical Research Building and the Emory Winship Cancer Institute Building. More recently, Mr. Williams and the Woodruff Foundation helped support construction of the Emory-Children's Center building to house pediatrics. During his tenure, Emory became one of the nation's top 20 research-oriented medical schools. The white coat presentation to Mr. Williams brings to mind another cherished part of the student ceremony when all receive a copy of On Doctoring , a collection of essays co-edited by our own John Stone. Sadly, Stone lost a short battle with cancer last November. (For more about him, see page 22.) He brought joy and beauty to our lives in many ways\u2014as a physi- cian, teacher, poet, writer, and friend. Stone had a special gift for words and often punctuated his conversations with \"thank goodness\" and \"glory be. \" Both are apt expressions to describe two remarkable people. Thank goodness for Jimmy Williams and John Stone and their lasting contributions to the School of Medicine. Thank goodness and glory be! Sincerely, Thomas J. Lawley Dean Dean Thomas Lawley (left) presented a white coat to Jimmy Williams during the dedication of the James B. Williams Medical Educa-tion Building. In Brief Predicting vaccine immunity Emory scientists have found a way to predict vaccine immunity without exposing people to infection. Using immunology, genomics, and bioinformatics, they confronted a long- standing challenge in vaccine development: determining immunity or effectiveness long after vaccination and, often, only after exposure to infection. Researchers with the Yerkes National Primate Research Center and the Emory Vaccine Center used the yellow fever vaccine (YF-17D) as a model. The vaccine, given to nearly half a billion people over the past 70 years, is one of the most successful ever developed. Yet little is known about the immunological mechanisms that make it so. A team led by Yerkes researcher Bali Pulendran worked with the Emory Vaccine Center, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle to determine why YF-17D is effective. The researchers vaccinated 15 healthy people with YF-17D and studied the T cell and antibody responses in their blood. Analysis of gene expression patterns in white blood cells showed that in most of the people the vaccine induced a network of genes involved in the early innate immune response against viruses. Through bioinformatics, the researchers identified distinct gene signatures that correlated with T cell response and the antibody response induced by the vaccine. \"To determine whether these gene signatures could predict immune response, we vaccinat- ed a second group of people and were able to predict with up to 90% accuracy which of those vaccinated would develop a strong T or B cell immunity to yellow fever,\" says Pulendran. Now his team is working to determine whether this approach can be used to predict the effectiveness of flu and other vaccines. If successful, the process could speed up evaluation of new and emerging vaccines and identification of people likely to resist immunity. Little is known about the immuno-logical mechanisms that make vaccines successful. Losing sleep over patient safety What physician doesn't remember the long hours of residency training with little time for rest? At the back of everyone's mind\u2014from residents and supervising physi- cians to medical school and hospital administrators\u2014is the worry that lack of sleep may jeopardize patient safety. Emory chancellor Michael M.E. Johns weighed the topic carefully as committee chair for an Institute of Medicine report, Resident Duty Hours: Enhancing Sleep, Supervision, and Safety. Issued late last year, the report proposes revising residents' duty hours and workloads to decrease the chances of fatigue-related medical errors and enhance their learning experience. The report does not seek to reduce residents' work hours from the maximum average of 80 per week set by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) in 2003 . Instead, the report recom- mends reducing the maximum number of hours worked without sleep to 16, increasing the number of days off, and restricting moonlighting. Altering residents' work hours alone, however, is not a silver bullet for ensuring patient safety, IOM com -mittee members stressed. They also called for greater supervision of residents by physicians, limits on patient caseloads based on residents' levels of experience and spe- cialty, and schedule overlap during shift changes to reduce the chances for error during patient hand- over from one doctor to another. The report cites financial costs and an insufficent health care work force as major barriers to further revis- ing resident work hours. It also calls for additional fund- ing to teaching hospitals, estimating that additional costs associated with shifting some work from residents to other health care personnel or additional residents could total $1.7 billion per year. The ACGME will review the IOM' s recommendations over the next several months . Online: To view the report on resident hours and patient safety, visit iom.edu/residenthours. EMORY MEDICINE 2EMORY MEDICINE 4 In Brief Between the Peachtrees Emory has expanded its visiblity between the Peachtrees. Now 100 years old, Emory Crawford Long Hospital, begins its second century as Emory University Hospital Midtown (EUHM). The name change more clearly aligns the hospital with Emory's health system. Located between Peachtree Street and West Peachtree, the hospital sits in an area of Atlanta that is expected to grow in terms of population and as a hub for patient care. Long-term plans for the hospital include the addition of 125 hospital beds, a new Emory Clinic building, and more research space. Currently, the 511-bed hospital has 2, 900 employees, 947 Emory medical faculty physicians, and 537 community physicians. While sporting a new name, EUHM retains much of its heritage with historic signage, the addition of CL to some new signage, and a historical display for visitors. The original 26-bed hospital opened in 1908 as the Davis-Fischer Sanatorium near present-day Turner Field. In 1911 , the hospital moved to its present site and in 1931 was renamed Crawford W . Long Memorial Hospital in honor of the Georgia physician who discovered ether for use as an anesthetic. The hospital became part of Emory in 1939 .Bittersweet journey As a medical student at Northwestern, Maura George set her sites on an internal medicine residency at Grady Memorial Hospital, which offered the diverse patient mix she desired. Ultimately, her decision led her to help a dying man return to Mexico. Her patient, a 37-year-old immi- grant, first came to the ER complain- ing of nausea, vomiting, thirst, and frequent urination. He was diagnosed and admitted for diabetic ketoaci- dosis treatment. He was discharged two days later, armed with diabetes information in Spanish and supplies to check his glucose and take insulin. But the disease had done its damage. A few days later, he returned to Grady, blind in his left eye, his face swollen, and his glucose level dangerously high. A CT scan of his head and face showed an invasive fungal infection that required sur - gery to remove his left eye. George then became part of his care team, providing aggressive medical treatment. His condition worsened, and he became unresponsive. Knowing he would not survive, the patient's family asked if he could return to them in Mexico. Their wish set off a flurry of letters and calls to the Mexican consulate by Grady doctors, including George and Carlos del Rio, who arranged for the patient's wife to fly from Mexico to Atlanta. Because the flight back to Mexico would be difficult, George volunteered to accompany the couple to provide medical care in tran-sit. Just getting the patient to and through the Atlanta airport proved challenging. The patient had to be safely secured, and curious onlookers made the long ride to the departure gate unsettling. \"It was very hard, \" recalls George. \"His wife was very loving. She held his hand and stroked his head. \" When they arrived in Mexico City, the patient's joy- ous family, including his 14-year-old daughter, greeted them at the airport. \"It was so humbling, and they were so grateful, \" says George. \"I didn't do anything. \" Still, there were tense moments on arrival: getting through customs after confusion over a passport, arriv-ing at the hospital to find the gates locked on Sunday, getting the patient to his room, and locating a nasal can- nula to ease his rapid breathing. For two days the patient lingered. George was about to call the family from her hotel room to check on his condition when she received a note from them in Spanish. Her patient had died. She returned home with-out seeing the family again. \"The trip was both heartwarming and sad, \" George says. \"It was important for the family to have closure. His wife understood everything every step of the way. If she had been unable to bring him home, she would have had unresolved feelings about his death. \" The journey also affirmed the resident's decision to train at Grady. \"It just reinforced where I want to prac- tice, \" says George, who will become an attending physi- cian there next year. \"It's an ideal setting and patient population. And the people there really try to reach out. \"\u2014Pam Auchmutey The science of problem solving Gregory Berns knows how to use his brain. The Emory psychia- trist is the idea man behind the new Center for Neuropolicy, which focuses on how the brain influences decision-making in politics, policy, and business. The center involves School of Medicine, Emory College, and Goizueta Business School researchers. \"We all live in groups, \" says Berns. \"Sometimes groups make good decisions, but groups often behave worse than any of its members would. We're approach- ing the problem of collective decision-making from a new perspective by studying how the human brain functions in groups. \" Center members will help advise decision-makers of all kinds by conducting experiments focused on biologi- cally based pressures that influence collective decision- making. Through their discoveries, researchers will better understand how culture, intelligence, and environment influence the way decisions are made and how basic human tendencies drive judgment in certain situations. As Berns points out, people also need to understand how religious and political ideolo- gies become transformed in the brain and can subvert basic self-survival value judgments, a phenomenon that occurs in war and terrorism. \"Collective decision-making is political, but politics are biological, \" says Berns. \"The human brain evolved to function in social groups. By discovering how our brains are wired to behave in groups, we can find solu- tions to problems of global impact. \" sometimes groups make good deci- sions, but groups often behave worse than any of its members would. \u2014Emory psychiatrist Gregory Berns Online: To learn more about Berns and the cen- ter, visit neuropolicy.emory.edu The doctor is in Physicians from Emory and Children's Healthcare of Atlanta are writing a weekly health blog for The Atlanta Journal- Constitution at AJC.com.

SUMMER 2009 5maura georgeEMORY MEDICINE 6 SUMMER 2009 7Beating back the pandemic devil s the recent H1N1 (swine flu) virus outbreak proves, speed and collective wisdom are vital in preventing a pandemic. For instance, scientists with the Emory- University of Georgia Influenza Pathogenesis and Immunology Research Center ( IPIRC ) are studying how the H1N1 virus enters cells, how it is transmitted, and how to interrupt both processes. They also are working to determine whether prior exposure to other influenza viruses may help or hinder response to the new virus, assess possible pre-existing immu- nity to H1N1 in different age groups, analyze the recovery of infected patients, and begin new vaccine development. Emory and University of Chicago researchers are testing a new method of producing highly targeted monoclonal antibod- ies to develop a diagnostic test and a temporary therapy to stave off the H1N1 virus. The antibodies, which can be isolated from a small amount of human blood infected with the virus, could be targeted against H1N1 and rapidly reproduced to detect or attack the virus. On yet another front, Emory and CDC scientists are using virus-like particles ( VLP s) to develop a faster, more efficient way to make flu vaccine. The current method of growing a vaccine in chicken eggs takes months and would strain the world's vaccine production capabilities should a pandemic occur. The scientists described the effectiveness of a VLP vaccine in mice in the March issue of PLoS (Public Library of Science) One. In their study, mice immunized with nose drops containing VLP s were protected for months against an otherwise lethal infection from H5N1 , the influenza variant in birds. VLP s appear to deliver several times more potency per milligram in mice than other types of vaccines. \"This extra potency is important because the current egg-grown vaccines require relatively high doses to be effective for most people, \" says Richard Compans, IPIRC director. \"In a pandemic, demand might run up against production capacity. VLP s could offer more bang for the buck. \"Living up to a vision Georgia cancer patients will have greater access to new clinical trials and technologies now that Emory Winship Cancer Institute has become the state's first National Cancer Institute (NCI) Cancer Center. The new designation marks a turning point for Winship and the 35,000 Georgians who are diag-nosed with cancer each year. As one of the nation's 65 NCI cancer centers, Winship will receive an influx of top-tier research funding from federal and private sources. During the next three years, the institute will receive nearly $4.3 million to grow its scientific research base. As part of their mandate, NCI-designated cancer centers extend the benefits of research directly to patients, their families, and the general public. Winship's new designation also will boost the state's economy by attracting medical firms, research companies, and physicians as collaborators. The late Robert Woodruff would be proud of how far Emory has come in cancer care and research. Established in 1937 with a gift from the legendary Coca-Cola CEO, Winship has made good on Woodruff's vision that no one should have to leave Georgia to receive excellent cancer care. And just recently, U.S. News & World Report recog- nized Winship as one of the nation's top 50 cancer centers. Keeping T cells young Patients with rheumatoid arthritis have T cells that are prematurely aged, Emory researchers have found. Reversing this defect could lead to new therapies for the disease. The T cells' chromosomes are depleted of telomeres, which cap the ends of the chromosomes and grow shorter each time cells divide unless a specialized enzyme replen- ishes them. Telomeres are believed to be important for healthy aging and cancer prevention. T cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis have trouble turning on the enzyme that replenishes telomeres, research-ers reported recently. The enzyme, telomerase, helps prevents loss of genetic informa-tion after cell division. Telomerase is active during embryonic develop- ment but usually switches off in adult cells. Some cancer cells reactivate it to enable rapid growth. Also, T cells can turn on the enzyme. T cells in patients with rheu- matoid arthritis make 40% less telomerase, says Cornelia Weyand, co-director of the Lowance Center for Human Immunology at Emory. Transferring telomerase into patients' T cells prevented the cells' death, and doing so could possibly \"reset\" their immune system. While the telomerase finding is promising, Weyand says, turning the enzyme on indiscriminately could lead to cancer. Treatments would need to target the right cells, she says.Epilepsy and cognitive development Women who take the antiepileptic drug val- proate during pregnancy could impair their child's cognitive development, according to a new study. The Neurodevelopmental Effects of Antiepileptic Drugs (NEAD) study followed more than 300 children born between 1999 and 2004 to women with epi-lepsy in the United States and the United Kingdom. The women took one of four epilepsy drugs: car - bamazepine, lamotrigine, phenytoin, or valproate. At age 3, children of mothers who took valproate had an average IQ six to nine points lower than children exposed to the other three drugs. \"Valproate has an important role in treating epi- lepsy because some patients' seizures can be con-trolled only with valproate,\" says lead study author Kimford Meador, Emory professor of neurology. \"However, we are recommending that women with epilepsy try another drug first.\" The effects of valproate appear to be dose- dependent, Meador notes, so taking lower dosages more frequently could reduce risk. The study was published in the April 16, 2009, issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. Previously, the NEAD study found that valproate also increases the risk of birth defects. each year, 35,000 georgians are diagnosed with cancer. cornelia weyand A brian hubbleSUMMER 2009 9 Move over, free radicals. A new theory puts sulfur center stage in understanding how the body responds to oxidative stress.Rej g Actnilggu A stroll through an Atlanta supermarket illustrates the awareness consumers have for the promise offered by antioxidants. By Quinn Eastman | Illustration by Richard Borge EMORY MEDICINE 8Fruit juices, herbal teas, yogurts, even cookies are advertised as containing an \"antioxidant advantage\" that might strengthen your immune system, fight aging, and lower the risk of var - ious diseases. Many consumers seem convinced that whether taken in a pill or a glass of juice, the more antioxidants, the better. Antioxidants such as vitamins C and E are supposed to soak up free radicals and cushion cells from their damaging effects, known collectively as oxidative stress. With this idea in mind, doctors designed large clinical studies to test the theory that sup- plementing the diet with antioxidant vitamins could protect against conditions such as heart disease and cancer. Unfortunately, the theory doesn't work. \"It appears that much recent research on antioxi- dants has been misdirected, \" says Dean Jones, bio- chemist and director of the clinical biomarkers lab at Emory. \"Studies with thousands of patients over sev- eral years keep showing the same thing: free-radical scavengers do little to prevent disease. Y et antioxidant supplements are a multi-billion-dollar industry. \" Jones has been developing an alternative theory: When it comes to oxidative stress, the focus should be less on free radicals and more on sulfur. Molecules containing sulfur are the body's most important con- trol points for regulating oxidative stress. Jones' work is guiding the development of tests to gauge a patient's risk for conditions such as heart failure and may lead to better understanding of how to supplement the diet with more effective antioxidants targeting sulfur.EMORY MEDICINE 10 SUMMER 2009 11 Back to the Mediterranean Instead of taking supplements found in pills, the best way to reduce oxidative stress may still be a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Viola Vaccarino, who leads emory's cardiovascular epidemiology research group, and former doctoral student Jun Dai, now a faculty member at indiana university, recently studied the connec-tion between diet and oxidative stress in a group of approximately 300 twins. Studying twins allowed the scientists to separate out genetic influences and factors from environmental ones. The twins' diets were scored for how closely they resembled the clas-sic Mediterranean diet, which includes large amounts of fruit, vegetables, whole grain breads, fish and poultry, small or moderate amounts of dairy products, and small amounts of red meat. The higher their Mediterranean diet score, the lower the twins' oxidative stress levels\u2014as measured by the proportion of oxidized glutathione\u2014tended to be. Dai and Vaccarino point out that their study did not gauge the effects of participants' consumption of specific fruits or vegetables or the antioxidants in them. The idea that certain antioxidants are responsible for the Medi-terranean diet's protective effects needs further testing. The proportion of cysteine-rich legumes, sources of fats, and amount of fried foods may also influence oxi-dative stress, Dai adds.\u2014Quinn EastmanViola Vaccarino studies cardiovascular epidemiology.Sulfur: the currency of oxidative stress Why is sulfur so important? Antioxidants come in many forms, but by far the most abundant and important ones are glutathione and cysteine. Both contain sulfur, which gives these compounds the ability to quench oxidants. In fact, sulfur gives them the ability to allow other non- sulfuric antioxidants like vitamin C to quench free radicals as well. When vita- min C absorbs free radicals, for example, glutathione and cysteine use sulfur to cycle the vitamin back to its origi- nal unoxidized form. Without sulfur, antioxidants like vitamin C would be inoperative. \"Cells use sulfur to settle their debts in oxidative stress, \" says Jones. \"Glutathione and cysteine help supply the currency to pay those debts. \" If glutathione and cysteine and their sulfur are so central to countering oxidative stress, why not give these compounds as dietary supplements instead of vitamins? \"It's not that simple, \" says Jones. \"We're still trying to sort that out. \" For one thing, glutathione (located inside cells) and cysteine (located outside cells) are important as anti- oxidants in different parts of the body. Each one comes in two forms: reduced (ready to go) and oxidized (used up). Jones and clinical nutrition expert Tom Ziegler have found that oxidized cysteine and glutathione lev- els rise and fall in daily cycles in response to meals but peak at times several hours apart. They also found that increasing cysteine levels in the bloodstream has little or no effect on glutathione levels inside cells. In addition, glutathione is broken down quickly in the intestines, and once swallowed, it becomes cysteine. In clinical trials in which patients with heart and lung disease took a form of cysteine, it seemed to help in some cases, but the actual dose taken was smaller than the amount of cysteine found in the average diet. Some studies also suggest that giving the body a pulse of cysteine tips the balance toward the less helpful oxidized form, the opposite of what was intended. Determining the best way to take sulfur-based antioxidants may require careful timing of intake with respect to sleep and meals and calibration of dose depending on age and metabolism. Other nutrients such as zinc, which affects the body's ability to use cysteine and glutathione, may need to be worked in as well. In addition to its potential as part of a highly regi- mented dietary supplement, cysteine has promise as a biomarker for inflammation and heart disease, says Jones. When he and his colleagues exposed white blood cells in culture to high lev-els of the less helpful (oxi- dized) form of cysteine, the cells showed signs of inflammation and dis-played \"sticky\" molecules on their surfaces that would make them more likely to adhere to vessel walls and form atherosclerotic plaques. It appears that enzymes important for driving inflammation become more or less active depending on the state of the sulfurs on their cysteines, Jones says. \"This is some of our most exciting work, \" he adds. \"It shows that there's a direct mechanistic link between oxidative stress, inflammation, and early events in ath- erosclerosis. \" Measuring oxidative stress Redefining oxidative stress points the way for cardiology researchers who are trying to develop better techniques to measure oxidative stress in the body. \"There are many markers of oxidative stress, but there is little agreement on which ones are useful,\" says cardiologist David Harrison, who studies the relationship between oxidative stress and hypertension. Focusing on sulfur as a measurement isn't always practical or affordable. Testing for cysteine and glutathione requires storing samples in a pre- servative and then analyzing them with a mass spectrometer. And as Jones has shown, looking at glutathione and cysteine is useful but may not tell the whole story. Measuring free radicals themselves is hard because they exist only for milliseconds. Harrison and colleagues have had success with measuring another form of reactive oxygen, lipid peroxides, which can cause cell injury or generate free radicals. Measuring lipid peroxides is surprisingly conve- nient, Harrison says, requiring only a finger prick and a bench-top measuring instrument. Collaborators Jones and cardiologist Sam Dudley have shown that levels of both lipid perox- ides and oxidized cysteine provide strong indicators of patients' risk of cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation. Jones believes that the best measurements of a patient's oxidative stress level will include a profile of several different markers. \"The goal is to develop a profile comparable in practicality and afford- ability to that used to determine whether one needs anti-cholesterol medication,\" he says. \"Having such a profile for oxidative stress and a protocol for how to respond could potentially prevent or forestall many kinds of illnesses and save many lives.\" EM Online : To learn more about Dean Jones' patent behind Sucrets Defense, a lozenge that contains glu- tathione, visit whsc.emory.edu/_pubs/hsc/winter08/ index.ehtml.

At Emory, the Health Literacy Working Group draws participants from the health sciences, Morehouse School of Medicine, Georgia State University, and state adult educational organi- zations to share informa- tion and seek funding. Emory's medical school routinely introduces the topic in class and clinic settings, hoping to inform the next genera- tion of physicians. \"Emory does a good job making sure we understand the issue,\" says David Gutteridge, a 2011 MD candidate. \"As a result, I've built some checks and balances into my actions to make sure the patient understands what I'm talking about. I ask them to tell me what they have understood about how they are supposed to take a medicine. I'm trying to open the door for them to ask me more questions.\" Across the nation, health literacy is beginning to get its due. Last year, the Association of American Medical Colleges began to set curriculum guidelines to make sure health literacy is addressed in all med- ical schools. Efforts are under way to include it on the national licensing test. And two senators intro- duced the National Health Literacy Act of 2007 , though the bill did not make it to committee. Parker is pleased with how far the issue has come but cautions that much remains to be done, particularly in light of future demographics. According to an article Parker recently co-wrote, U.S. literacy skills are expected to worsen by 2030, based on trends in immigration, birth rates among illiterate women, and employment. \"We have some pretty powerful people today who are paying attention to health literacy, so I'd have to say I'm optimistic,\" says Parker. \"But demographically, if we don't address it, we are going to end up in a bad place. If we don't change the direction in which we're headed, we're brewing the perfect storm.\" EMRuth Parker was working at Grady Memorial Hospital when a patient in his 60s was admitted with a severe leg infec- tion. His chart showed that he had visited the ER twice in the past two weeks for the problem and was given antibiotics, but the infection continued to worsen. For Parker, a professor of medi- cine at Emory, it was a red flag. After gently questioning the patient, she discovered he wasn't sure what he was supposed to do with the antibiotics he was given during the previous ER visits and didn't want to bother anyone by asking. He just filled the prescription and kept the pills in his pocket. He hadn't taken a single one. \"Incidents like this happen all the time and not just at Grady,\" says Parker. The Perfect Storm Too often, patients become sicker because they can't understand doctors' instructions. Ruth Parker sees a dark cloud coming unless physicians address low health literacy. By Martha Nolan McKenzieIndeed, studies have shown that nearly half of all American adults\u2014 90 million people\u2014have difficulty understanding and acting upon health information. Many lack the necessary vocabulary to comprehend their phy- sician's instructions and the literacy skills to read the instructions on their prescriptions. The impact of low health literacy is extremely costly on the national level and devastat- ing on a personal one. \"Health literacy is like your currency for negoti- ating the health care sys- tem,\" says Parker. \"If you have low health literacy, you are more likely to use the ER, more likely to be hospitalized, and less likely to use preventive services.\" Yet most health care providers remain unaware of the problem. \"It's embarrassing for patients,\" says Parker. \"They don't come out and say, 'I don't understand what in the heck you are telling me to do or what this pamphlet means.' As a result, most of us in the health field still don't realize that many of our patients struggle to understand what it is they need to do, and we certainly don't practice medicine like that's the reality.\" Parker is working to change this scenario. Since stumbling on the issue almost 20 years ago, she has emerged as one of the nation's leading experts on health literacy. She co-authored the first pub- lished study of functional health literacy and helped develop the measuring tool now routinely used in studies. She currently consults with the FDA on an initiative to standardize and simplify instructions on pill bottles. \"As the investigator of one of the first stud- ies showing the prevalence of low health literacy and the correlation between low health literacy and poor health outcomes, Ruth helped define the issue,\" says Joanne Schwartzberg, director of aging and community health for the American Medical Association (AMA) and senior adviser on health lit- eracy for the AMA Foundation. \"Since then, she has pushed the issue everywhere.\" Health literacy is like your currency for negotiating the health care system. If you have low health lit - eracy, you are more likely to use the ER, more likely to be hospitalized, and less likely to use preventive services. \u2014Ruth Parker, professor of medicine EMORY MEDICINE 12Three weeks later, however, heart function had signifi- cantly improved. \"We think this difference is explained in that myo- cardial infarction causes significant damage in the first 24 to 48 hours, \" Davis says. \"The half-life of our particle is about seven days, so it is likely that the inhibitor was not released fast enough to affect heart function at the seven-day mark. \" Overall, the microparticles reduced formation of scar tissue by 70% to 80% and improved heart function by at least 20%. Microparticles have had limited use in the treatment of inflammatory disease because traditional delivery methods and their by-products caused the very thing they were supposed to limit\u2014inflammation. Davis and his team found that PLGA (a polyester approved for use in sutures and grafts) did cause inflammation, but that PCADK did not. \" PCADK has the potential to be used to deliver other kinds of anti-inflammatory drugs for other diseases, \" says Davis, whose study results were published in nature materials (October/November 2008 ). In the future, he hopes the microparticle-drug combination could be used clinically to treat diseases of the liver, lungs, and spinal cord as well as the heart. EMAn injection of just the drug didn't work though; it likely diffused away too quickly. \"The drug releases at a rate that is dependent on the breakdown of the particle, \" says Davis. \" As the particles break down and are hydrolyzed, the drug is released. In our study, half of the drug was released in about seven to 10 days. \" In contrast, the team also tested another carrier molecule, a glycolic acid known as PLGA . PLGA broke down into lactic acid and caused an increase in p38. \"Since PLGA is a standard for drug delivery and one of the only clinically approved polymers, we used that target, \" says Davis. \"But there's a reason why it's not used for heart disease. Anyone who has run or worked out too much can tell you how bad lactic acid is. It hurts. These PLGA particles degrade into lactic acid, which is not good when you already have an inflamma- tory response resulting from heart failure. That's the big difference in this study\u2014neutral degradation products versus acidic degradation products. \" When Davis and his team looked at heart function in rats injected with the PCADK beads seven days after induced heart attack, they found no real improvement. RResearchers believe that a number of anti-inflammatory drugs, if delivered directly into the heart following heart attack, could pre- vent permanent damage and prolong heart function. The challenge, however, is finding an effective way to deliver the drugs. Some drugs require such large doses that toxicity becomes a risk. Others must be injected daily. Certain drug delivery methods themselves can cause inflammation. EMORY MEDICINE 14 SUMMER 2009 15By Kay Torrance | Illustration by Carol Hatcher The right recipe A new microparticle-drug combination may be key to reducing inflammation caused by heart attack and other diseases An Emory research team believes it has found the right recipe of ingredients to one day make safe, effective drug-laden microparticles for heart attack patients. The team, led by biomedical engineer Michael E. Davis, found that injecting animal hearts with microparticles formulated with the polymer PCADK \u2014 poly(cyclohexane-1,4-diylacetone dimethylene ketone)\u2014improved cardiac function after simulated heart attack. Unlike other \"carrier\" molecules, PCADK degrades into two benign substances: 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol, -approved food additive, and acetone, an endog- enous compound. Inside the polymer beads was an experimental drug, SB239063 , a p38 inhibitor. P38 is a protein kinase that regulates the production of inflammatory mediators. It also plays a role in the death of myocardial cells. The polymer bead containing the drug stayed in the heart and slowly dissolved, allowing sustained release of the drug to suppress p38 activation for at least seven days. After simulating heart attack in rats, biomedical engineer Michael E. Davis found that injecting their hearts with microparticles containing a p38 inhibi-tor drug reduced formation of scar tissue by 70% to 80% and improved heart function by at least 20%.EMORY MEDICINE 16 SUMMER 2009 17 lated living room set up in Kemp's lab, but their response has been overwhelmingly positive. \"It's exciting to watch it work. I am just amazed, \" says Norma Margeson, a Marietta, Georgia, resident who was diagnosed with ALS (amyotrophic lat- eral sclerosis) in 2006 . \"I push a button on a little hand remote and shine the laser on a telephone that is on a table, \" she says. \"The robot then tells me to look into its eyes and it brings the phone to my hands. \" The robot has an arm equipped with sen- sors so that it can determine not only how and where to retrieve items but also when to loosen its grasp. \"When I would take hold of the phone, it would know that I had it and let it go, \" adds Margeson. More studies are planned in the lab, but Glass is eager to see whether the robot is sophisticated enough to negotiate the intricacies of a home environment\u2014a milestone that is probably a year or two away. And he would like to see the robot perform more fine-motor movements. \"Making this robot pick up a cup with a straw in it and hold it up to somebody's mouth so that they can drink from it\u2014that would be very useful, \" says Glass. \"I am just a dreamer here. But what I have realized is that when I dream, Charlie says 'yes, we can do that. ' Working with the engineers at Georgia Tech has been an extraordinary experi- ence for me and my patients. \" EMNew-Age Home Companion By Dorothy Brooks Putting robots at the disposal of patients with sig- nificant motor impairments not only could help them maintain their independence but also help relieve physical and financial burdens faced by caregivers. In fact, such an innovation may only be a few years away from reality thanks to a project involving clinicians at Emory's School of Medicine and engineers at Georgia Tech. Together, they developed a robot that can perform simple tasks such as opening drawers and retrieving objects. Dubbed EL-E (pronounced \"Ellie\"), the 5\u00bd-foot- tall machine glides across the floor on wheels and takes direction from a laser pointer that users can control in a variety of ways, depending on their preferences and capabilities. The name refers to EL-E's arm, which moves like the trunk of an elephant. Biomedical engineers are adding more functional- ity to the robot all the time by taking their cues from patients and clinicians who help them understand what types of movement and capability are needed. The result- ing synergy from this working model has been a bit of a revelation to both engineers and clinicians. \" As physicians, we often don't realize what engineers can invent and create. Many of us who work in hospi- tals and clinics basically use equipment and machines that are off the shelf and don't necessarily work with the specific needs of our patients, \" says neurologist Jonathan Glass, director of Emory's ALS Clinic. \"This is different. By working directly with the people who are designing these robots, we can create products that will be very useful and potentially life-changing for patients. \" Likewise, Charlie Kemp, who directs the Healthcare Robotics Lab at Georgia Tech, depends on Glass's guid-ance to make sure that EL-E offers the most functionality for patients. One of the most important insights he has gained is that there is considerable variation in how patients prefer to communicate with the robot. \"To some extent, we know that if people lack dexterity in their hands, they're going to be more likely to prefer to use a head-mounted laser pointer, and if they have high dexterity in their hands, they're going to be more likely to prefer a hand-held laser pointer. But in the end there is still significant user prefer - ence, \" he says. \"What that means is that we should really be looking to develop technologies that can support lots of different user preferences easily and flexibly. \" Thus far, Kemp's lab has designed interfaces that enable patients to control the robot through a hand- held laser pointer, a head-mounted laser pointer that is controlled through head movements, and a touch screen. Additionally, scientists are now taking advantage of speech recognition technology so that patients can give the robot verbal commands. The idea behind this approach is to model the robot after service dogs that are typically trained to understand fewer than 100 words. Kemp suggests that equipping the robot to respond to these same verbal cues is well within the capabilities of current technology. Robots can't offer the warmth and companionship that service dogs provide, but they don't need to be fed and watered and can operate 24/7. Further, Glass points out that there is a long waiting list for service dogs, which are expensive to train. He expects that by the time the robot is fully developed and mass produced, it will be no more expensive than a motorized wheelchair. Only a handful of patients from the ALS Clinic have had the opportunity to interact with the robot in a simu-By working directly with the people who are designing these robots, we can create products that will be very useful and potentially life-changing for patients. \u2014Jonathan Glass, director of Emory's ALS Clinic I push a button on a little hand remote and shine the laser on a telephone that is on the table.

But in the years preceding his death in 1997 , Brown lost his ability to think and speak as he struggled daily with Parkinson's disease. \"To know the wonder - ful vibrant person he was and to see how the disease robbed him of that was devastating, \" says his wife, Mary Louise \"Lou\" Brown Jewell. When her late hus- band was diagnosed with Parkinson's, Jewell was relieved that he did not have a brain tumor. But her hopes faded as the dis- ease progressed. He also suffered from Lewy body dementia, a more progres- sive form of Parkinson's that affects memory and the ability to reason and carry out simple actions. It also causes hallucinations. In addition to Brown's illness and death, Jewell endured the loss of her mother as a result of amy- otrophic lateral sclerosis or ALS. Jewell's experiences led her to make a $2 mil- lion pledge to establish the A. Worley Brown Chair in Neurology and donate $500,000 to reno- vate the A. Worley Brown Family Parkinson's Disease Clinical Research Unit at Wesley Woods. Both con- tributions are the lead gifts for an endowment to raise funds for research, service, and education in neurol- ogy for Parkinson's and other movement disorders. Both gifts are also part of Campaign Emory, the university's $1.6 billion fund-raising initiative launched publicly last September. Begun quietly in 2005 , Campaign Emory encompasses schools and units across the university, including the School of Medicine. As of early June, the school had raised $302 million toward its $500 million goal to garner resources to recruit and retain faculty, construct and equip new research facilities, increase student scholarships, and expand research to improve patient care. The School of Medicine has built momentum aided by vol- unteer leaders like Ada Lee and Pete Correll, the former serving as the school's campaign chair. Impressed by the care they received from Emory physicians, the couple invested in Emory by sup- porting scholarships and faculty research and teach- ing through the Correll Foundation. They also chaired the drive to fund the medical school's new building. In addition to the Corrells, the school has received support for Campaign Emory from a number of donors, includ- ing Rex Fuqua, president and CEO of Fuqua Capital Corporation, for treat-ment of depression; the late Andrew McKelvey, founder of Monster.com, for research and patient care in lung transplanta- tion; Atlanta philanthro- pists Lou and Tom Glenn for breast cancer research; Charles Brady, INVESCO co-founder, for frontotem-poral dementia research; and John Brock, Coca- Cola Enterprises chair - man and CEO , for cancer nanotechnology research (see story at right). Jewell shares a bond with these and other donors committed to advancing the detection and treatment of disease. In her case, she is helping develop a comprehensive center for Parkinson's disease. \"I want Emory to be one of the leading research institutions where they can discover what causes Parkinson's and what causes Lewy body dementia, \" she says. \"I want there to be a cure, and through the research being performed at Emory I feel that can be accomplished. \" \u2014Maria Lameiras and Pam Auchmutey Powering up to advance cancer nanotechnology Thanks to John Brock, his wife Mary, and their three children, two endowed faculty chairs at Emory Winship Cancer Institute and Georgia Tech will support research in cancer nano-technology. The family, together with the Georgia Research Alliance and the Georgia Cancer Coalition, made the gifts total-ing $6 million in honor of John's mother, Anise McDaniel Brock, who died of cancer in 2007 . Although she never smoked and followed a healthy lifestyle, she was diagnosed with lung and colon cancer in 2006. She was treated pri-marily in Mississippi until her family brought her to Emory. Following her death, the Brock family looked for ways to help research- ers develop new leads in the early detection and treatment of cancer. A Georgia Tech alumnus, Brock talked with cancer researchers and physicians at Emory and Georgia Tech about their nanomedicine research program. He also worked with the Georgia Cancer Coalition and the Georgia Research Alliance to enhance the value of his donation. The result is the Anise McDonald Brock Chair and Georgia Research Alliance Eminent Scholar in Cancer Nanotechnolgy at Emory, with a second chair at Georgia Tech. Brock points to the care his mother received at Emory Winship and the strength of the joint research programs at Emory and Georgia Tech as the inspiration behind his family's gift. \"My mother was a caregiver in her com-munity, \" he says. \"She would be thrilled that some value can be created in the search for better ways to manage cancer. \" mary Louise \"Lou\" Brown JewellJohn and mary Brock i want emory to be one of the leading research institutions where they can discover what causes parkinson's and what causes Lewy body dementia. \u2014 Mary Louise \"Lou\" Brown Jewell Online : To learn more about how to support the School of Medicine through Campaign Emory, visit campaign.emory.edu/ schools-and-units/.kay hinTOn The COCa-COla COMpanyEMORY MEDICINE 20Gifts & Support SUMMER 2009 21The powerful bond between parent and child is advancing the study of potential treatment targets for HIV/AIDS . Last year, Concerned Parents for AIDS Research (CPFA) , a New Y ork-based group of parents, some of whom have lost children to AIDS , contributed $250,000 to the Emory Vaccine Center. The seed grant made it possible for Emory and Harvard to collaborate on stud- ies of a protein that inhibits the immune response to chronic infectious diseases like HIV . Two years ago, Emory and Harvard scientists dis- covered that the immune inhibitor protein PD-1 (pro - grammed death-1) helps switch off the immune response to chronic infectious diseases, resulting in apparent \"exhaustion\" of the T-cell response. Thanks to the seed grant, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases awarded a $13 million, five-year program project grant, allowing Emory and other scientists to focus on PD-1 and its role in HIV and other chronic viral infections. Andrew Lipschitz, medical director of CPFA , believes that future success in stopping HIV/AIDS depends on sharing resources. \"Our initial grant made sense because Emory had certain techniques and equipment that Harvard did not and vice versa, \" he says. \"By sharing their ideas and technol-ogy, Emory and Harvard were able to increase their understanding of PD-1 and qualify for the NIH grant, which will enable more collaboration and help sci-entists move more quickly to find treatments and cures for HIV .\" With the NIH grant, the research team now includes scientists from Emory, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts General Hospital, New Y ork University, the University of Montreal, and the University of Pennsylvania. They plan to identify new targets, pathways, and drugs that could aim for PD-1 , turn off this protein, reactivate the immune response, and possibly clear HIV infection. There may be other benefits as well. \"Our work has clear implications for the treatment of tumors and auto- immune diseases and for increasing the success of trans- plantation, \" says Rafi Ahmed, project leader and Emory Vaccine Center director. Ahmed also is a new member of the National Academy of Science.\u2014Holly KorschunStraight from the heart for HIV/AIDS Running strong for ALS fter being inspired by two athletes cut down by a devastating disease in their prime, teenager Brian Duffy and his family have raised more than $17,000 for research and programs at Emory's ALS Clinic. Brian first learned about amyotrophic lateral sclero- sis (ALS) , or Lou Gehrig's disease, in 2005 after watching the Ironman Triathlon from Hawaii. That year racer Jon Blais became the first person with ALS to complete the race. A year later, Blais was in a wheelchair. Less than two years after his diagnosis, he died. At the end of a news story on Blais, Brian told his parents, Karen and Mike Duffy, that he wanted to help. With their support, he began a letter-writing campaign in 2006 and raised more than $2,200 that year. His par - ents ran triathlons, and his younger brother, Kevin, a golfer, sold golf balls to raise money. But for Brian, it wasn't enough. At his urging, the family held its first annual \"Run for Life 5K-A Race to End Lou Gehrig's Disease\" in 2006 . The third annual race was May 2, 2009 \u2014the same day that Lou Gehrig took himself out of the New Y ork Y ankees lineup in 1939 because of the disease. All proceeds support the Emory ALS Center, which Kevin (left) and Brian Duffy use their love of sports to raise funds for emory's ALs clinic. Emory's Jane Fonda Center is working to get past the controversy by building programs that put an emphasis back on the core needs of young people from 6th grade on. \"Becoming sexual is evolutionary, involuntary, and inevi- table,\" says Melissa Kottke, the center's director. \"However, becoming a healthy sexual being is not. Today, we must start at a younger age than ever before to help young people make smooth transitions to adulthood.\" Using a $500,000 grant from the Ford Foundation, the Fonda Center is conceptualizing a new framework for thought and action regarding sex education, which includes ways to partner with youth. Center staff are planning regional meetings among professionals interested in sex edu- cation and a nationwide youth retreat. The impetus behind the planning is to lay a foundation among young people for respect and responsible action, says Kottke. \"Early on young people must learn to respect their bodies as well as their rights and the rights of others to be free from pregnancy and infection.\" Another grant of up to $1 million from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) is allowing the Fonda Center to teach youth how to develop healthy relationships and pre-vent intimate partner violence. According to a 2007 Georgia Department of Human Resources report, one of every six high school students was hit, slapped, or physically hurt on purpose by a boyfriend or girlfriend during the prior 12 months. The Fonda Center is offering a dating violence prevention program to 7th graders in the Atlanta Public Schools, supported by an RWJF national social marketing campaign and multiple partner agencies who are banding together to help teens mature safely and responsibly.\u2014Rhonda Mullen Knowing when to start talking about sex and what to say is not a simple issue.

Research at the clinic focuses on basic mechanisms of motor neu- ron degeneration, genetics of ALS, and new experimental treatments. The clinic also provides care to ALS patients and their families. Demand for care has increased dramatically since the center was named an MDA regional network clinical research center, one of five in the country and the only one in the Southeast. Jonathan Glass, the clinic's director, looks to volunteers like Karen Duffy to help support ALS patients and their families. \"These volunteers provide a link to the community and let people know how important and special this center is, \" says Glass. \"Brian's efforts are what really started this, and he and his brother are amazing kids. They exemplify what people really can do to make an impact. \" Now a rising sophomore at South Forsyth High School north of Atlanta, Brian runs cross-country and is on the swim team. He often has to explain ALS to his classmates when they see the \"Cure for ALS\" bumper sticker on the family car. \"My goal, \" he says, \"is to have ALS become as well known as other diseases, so people will become more aware of it and do more to help find a cure. \"\u2014Maria Lameirasfounded and directed the resi- dency program in emergency medicine, now a department. He pulled from his experi- ences to co-edit Principles and Practices of Emergency Medicine ( 1978 ), the first comprehensive textbook in the specialty.

He also received the Thomas Jefferson Award, the university's top award for service, leadership, and achievement\u2014one of nu- merous scholarly honors from various schools. As a writer, Stone is perhaps best known for On Doctoring: Stories, Poems, Essays ( 1991 ), an anthology of literature and medicine that he co-edited with Richard Reynolds, former executive vice president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Stone III, who found joy in medicine, the arts, family, and people from all walks of life, died of cancer on November 6, 2008 . He was 72. As a cardiologist, teacher, mentor, and writer, Stone focused his entire career on matters of the heart, memorial- ized in his books of poems and essays in which he explored the link between medicine and literature. Stone was beloved by many for many reasons\u2014his humor, his listening skills and ability to inspire listening in others, his traditional Veteran's Day read- ings of WWI poems, the poem he was asked to write for Emory President James Wagner's inau-guration, and his teaching by example of the healing power of kindness. He used to say that he wore a \"double harness\" of litera-ture and medicine, an easy fit because both are centered on the human story. His own human story was filled with accomplishment, recognition, even celebrity. He was a perennial favorite as a speaker at medical graduation and other events, and his two-man show with Emory music professor William Ransom, \"The Poet and the Pianist, \" performed at Emory alumni events all over the country, made it all the way to Carn- egie Hall in 2001 . Stone joined the faculty in 1969 after completing an Emory fellowship in cardiology. He spent the first half of his career at Grady Memorial Hospital, where he ory. Thus, in 1983 , Stone created one of the first courses combining literature and medicine. He also taught the course for several years at England's Oxford University as part of Emory's Summer Studies Program. \"The literature allowed us to discuss things that we all faced, \" says Eley, who now oversees medical education and student affairs. \"John turned out to be the 'heart' of our medical school. He was where we smiled, cried, rejoiced, and were comforted. \" A writer since 8th grade, Stone began his literary career with The Smell of Matches ( 1972 ), which won an award from the Georgia Writers Association. Another book of poems, Renaming the Streets ( 1985 ), won the Literature Award from the Mississippi Institute of Arts and Letters. In all, Stone wrote five books of poetry and a book of essays, for which he was inducted into the Georgia Writers Hall of Fame in 2007 , the same year as novelist Ferrol Sams 45M . A lover of music, Stone wrote the libretto for Canticles of Time, a choral symphony that won the Music Award of the Mississippi Institute of Arts & Letters in 1991 . The grandson of a general practitioner, Stone was reared in Jackson, Mississippi. Both of his sons became physicians\u2014James 01M at Emory Johns Creek Hospital and John 85C at Massachusetts General Hospital. Their mother, Lu 85G, died in 1991 . Stone's second wife, Mae, worked with him at Emory and after his retirement con- tinued to shape his life so he could write. Those who knew Stone were accustomed to seeing his front pocket bursting with 3x5 index cards full of notes about any and everything. The cards allowed him to cap- ture what he loved most: listening to others, especially his patients. \"Most patients are ambiguities, living and breath- ing ones, \" said Stone in a convocation address to Emory freshmen in 1981 . \"The patient is ambiguous because the patient is his own art... Like art, the patient does not tell all that he has to say at the first sitting. The more we look [and listen]...the more there is to see and hear. \"\u2014Kay Torrance, Pam Auchmutey, and Sylvia Wobel In 2005 , the Department of Emergency Medicine estab- lished the John Stone Fund for Emergency Medicine to honor his talents as a teacher, clinician, and residency program founder.

The pavilion is part of Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital, where John Inman Jr. 45M began delivering babies in 1952 . A longtime community leader in Albany, Inman still has strong ties to Emory. He serves on the Board of Advisers for the School of Medicine and has chaired a number of fund-raising drives.

But they are of the human form, and on returning to Earth, they find Smith Johnston 81M waiting for them. A medical officer and flight surgeon for NASA at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Johnston is one of the top guys responsible for astronauts' health\u2014before, during, and after flights. He has to make sure that any flight candidate is healthy enough to withstand the immense physical toll on the body caused by weightlessness in outer space. \"We take the healthiest people in the world and put them in one of the most hazardous environ- ments, \" says Johnston. \"I think of myself as running the ultimate preventive medicine clinic. \" When a space shuttle is in flight, Johnston sits in mission control to monitor the astronauts during their awake hours. (No easy feat since it takes two years to become certified to sit in mission control.) Astronauts lose 1% to 2% of their bone mass each month and 15% of their blood volume during a mis- sion. Kidney stones are a common problem, as are skin rashes from the lack of showering. (Astronauts also have to swallow their toothpaste.) They often face decompression sickness after space walks and upon their return to Earth. Johnston developed screening standards for sci- entists to work at the South Pole for the National Science Foundation. Conditions are so extreme eight months of the year that no one can be evacu- ated should a medical emergency occur. Workers there also suffer sleep disturbances and vitamin D deficiencies, as the sun never rises for many months of the year. The flight surgeon has worked in a number of places, including Russia and Kazakhstan, where the front end of a space capsule overheated and caused a huge brush fire upon landing. \"We thought we had lost the astronauts, but luckily they were okay, \" Johnston says. The Kazakhstan incident brought to mind the seven astronauts who died aboard the Columbia space shuttle, which disintegrated on its return to Texas in 2003 . Johnston recently traveled to Israel to observe the February 1st anniversary of the death of Ilan Ramon, the first Israeli astronaut, who was aboard the flight. Despite the risks, Johnston would serve as an astronaut on a mission, given the opportunity. \"But it's a young person's game, \" he says. He looks forward to the day when the Orion, a new Apollo- shaped craft for lunar travel, replaces the space shuttle in about 2015 and when astronauts travel to Mars (at least a year's trip to and from the planet). For a medical school graduate who seemed to like every specialty, Johnston found the right one.
