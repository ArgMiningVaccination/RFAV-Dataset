Every thought you think has an effect on every one of the 50 trillion cells in your body. We think at least 50,000 thoughts a day and about 70% of those are negative and usually they are same as the ones we had the day before. Our lives are run on autopilot, as our sub-conscious mind, which governs 95% of our mind runs the show, usually from beliefs and values programmed into us before the age of seven.

So when you are trying to heal from a conscious level - citing affirmations and telling yourself you're healthy - there may be an invisible subconscious program that's sabotaging you.\" If you want to take back control of your life, hypnosis is the perfect way to bypass the conscious mind.
