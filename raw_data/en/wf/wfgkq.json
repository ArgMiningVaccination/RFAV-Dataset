Colleagues and I previously reviewed the evidence for these propositions and put forward what has become known as the Increasing Vaccination Model. To makethe model more accessible to practitioners, the current paper summarizes the main insights from the earlier work. First, observational studies show clearly that thoughts and feelingsare correlated with vaccine uptake. Such constructs include perceived risk of harm from infectious disease and condence in vaccine safety and efcacy. However, interventions havenot generally shown that changing thoughts and feelingsincreases vaccine uptake. Second, social processes are promis- ing in observational studies. Such constructs include social norms, altruism, and sharing through social media. Moreresearch is needed in this promising area before it will be pos- sible to conclude whether social processes are effective inter- vention targets. Third, interventions that directly changebehavior\u2014without trying to change what people think or feel or their social experience \u2014are reliably effective ways to increase vaccine uptake. Such interventions include reminders, defaults, and vacci ne requirements. Finally, the most potent intervention for increasing vaccine uptake is a health care provider recommendation, but it is still unclear whether such recommendations are effective because theyincrease condence, set a social norm, or reflect a direct behavior change technique. T he paper ends by describing use of the model by a World Health Organization workinggroup as it considers opportunities to address low vaccina-tion uptake globally. TAGGEDPKEYWORDS :nudges; PEDIATRICS 2021;21:S9 S16 TAGGEDPWHATTHISNARRATIVE Review Adds Our previous review on increasing vaccine uptake has been widely used, but its complexity has hindered its use by some practitioners. This brief and accessible article will allow people to more readily understandthe key ndings. B EHAVIORAL SCIENCE OFFERS several ideas about what it takes to get people to vaccinate. The 3 main propositionsare that vaccination results from: 1) what people think andfeel; 2) social processes; and 3) direct behavior change (Fig. 1 ). Colleagues and I previously reviewed the evi- dence for these propositions and put forward what hasbecome known as the Increasing Vaccination Model. 1 That paper generated substantial interest from public health organizations, including the World Health Organi-zation (WHO) and the US Centers for Disease Controland Prevention, vaccine manufacturers, researchers, andpractitioners. However, its length and complexity have been barriers to the model's use by some practitioners. To facilitate wider adoption of the model, this paper summa-rizes the main insights from the earlier work and describesuse of the model by a WHO working group as it considers opportunities to address low vaccination uptake globally,especially through effective interventions. Vaccination is one of the most widely accepted health behaviors. Globally, 86% of children have received ameasles vaccine, and that percentage is higher in NorthAmerica and Europe as of 2018. 2Coverage is even higher for the diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccine. Thesehigh rates have caused the incidence of many infectiousdiseases to plummet in the decades since relevantvaccines have been introduced. Such successes have led to calls for complete eradication of polio and regional elimination or control of other diseases through vaccina-tion. Indeed, at the start of this decade, WHO and otherorganizations designated 2011 20 as the Decade of Vaccines. However, by 2019, WHO had declared vaccination hes- itancy to be one of the top 10 threats to global publichealth. 2This threat could have several consequences. Inadequate coverage is the uptake of vaccination that fails to meet an agreed-on quality marker (eg, 90% coverage).While global vaccination coverage rates have steadilydrifted upward, they have stalled in some regions and ACADEMIC PEDIATRICS Copyright \u00a92021 by Academic Pediatric Association S9Volume 21, Number 4S MayJune 2021even slipped backward in a few countries. Delay is getting vaccines after the recommended age or spreading thedoses out over time. Despite clear ndings that the currentvaccination schedule is safe, parents are increasinglychoosing to spread out or delay vaccines in the mistakenbelief that having fewer vaccines at one time will reducethe risk of harm. Instability is variability in coverage over time, most often a sharp drop. Some countries with gener- ally high vaccination coverage have experienced periods of dramatic instability. For example, Japan had achieved70% coverage for human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccina-tion, yet coverage fell to 7% within a year of an unsub-stantiated safety scare. Denmark had a similar issue that itwas able to turn around, but only after coverage had fallenby half. 3 The model is about what works to increase vaccination uptake, which results from a series of behaviors by vari- ous actors. The family may talk about vaccines withfriends, search for information online, schedule anappointment, travel to a clinic, consent to vaccination,return for any needed follow-up doses, and pay anyrelated costs, such as an administration fee or travel expenses. Providers stock vaccines, recommend them,track their use in medical records, flag who is due andoverdue, and manage their vaccine stock. All of this is ina context of a system in which the state funds some vacci-nations and, in some countries, private insurance coversother vaccinations. In sum, vaccination uptake resultsfrom a web of interconnected players, resources, and behaviors, all of which follow predictable patterns. TAGGEDH1WHATPEOPLE THINK AND FEEL The model's rst broad proposition is that what people think and feel motivates vaccination uptake ( Fig. 2 ). On the left side of the gure, disease risk appraisals are thoughts and feelings about potential health problemscaused by infectious agents (perceived risk and fear); vac- cine condence is the attitude that vaccines are good (effective) or bad (unsafe). Risk appraisals and condence motivate people to vaccinate or not to do so, as shown in the middle.

While some people use the terms condence and hesitancy interchangeably, it is helpful to separatethese ideas: low condence is a cause of low motivationto vaccinate in the model and indeed in research goingback 50 years. 4Finally, motivation to vaccinate leads to vaccination uptake , shown in the right. Getting vaccinated can lower some appraisals of disease risk and increasevaccine condence, as shown by the arrows going fromthe far right back to the left. 5 Findings from observational studies support the thoughts and feelings proposition. Vaccine uptake is asso-ciated with higher disease risk appraisals including think-ing infectious diseases are likely, serious, and regrettable. 6,7Similarly, vaccine uptake is associated with higher vaccine condence, as shown by believing thatvaccines are important, save lives, and have few sideeffects. Finally, motivation to vaccinate, also called inten-tion, is one of the strongest predictors of health behaviors,including vaccine uptake. 8 However, experimental evidence from randomized tri- als generally does notsupport the thoughts and feelings proposition. This stronger body of evidence better answers the question of whether interventions focused onthoughts and feelings can increase vaccine uptake. Riskcommunication interventions did not appreciably increasevaccine uptake, according to a recent meta-analysis of 16studies, although the interventions somewhat increasedthe belief that infectious diseases are likely. 9An older meta-analysis, restricted to 5 risk communication inter- ventions that increased risk appraisals, did nd increases in vaccine uptake.10 Similarly, interventions to boost vaccine condence have generally not increased uptake, and none have shownthat increased condence explains the interventions'impact. While some intervention studies have increasedvaccine condence, including beliefs that vaccines aresafe and effective, 11,12others have not.13 Finally, interventions to increase motivation to vac- cinate have not shown reliably that they can influencehesitant people, despite success at increasing motiva-tion for other behaviors. 14Decision aids have little support in increasing vaccine uptake. Motivational inter-viewing, while promising, has yet to be shown effective ina randomized trial, although it has been included as one component of several effective multicomponent interven-tions 15and has shown promise in quasiexperimental studies.16 In sum, while thoughts and feelings motivate people to get vaccinated, interventions targeting thoughts and feel- ings have shown little promise for reliably increasing vac-cine uptake. Furthermore, there is no apparent logic as towhen interventions boost vaccine risk appraisals and con-dence, have no effect, or even have pernicious effects. Ireturn later to the question of whether thoughts and feel-ings interventions might generate support for vaccinationpolicies and programs, an important outcome that is dis- tinct from vaccination uptake. TAGGEDH1SOCIAL PROCESSES The model's second broad proposition is that social processes motivate vaccine uptake ( Fig. 3 ). The social network , the collection of connections among people is shown in the left side of the gure. These networks havethe characteristic of similarity or homophily \u2014birds of a feather flock together. Social networks exert influencethrough contagion, that is, through the spread of ideas andbehaviors. This spread, shown in the middle, establishessocial norms , what most people do and or expect others to do, along with social preferences (altruism, vaccinating to protect others, and free riding, not vaccinating becauseothers already have). Finally, social norms and preferen-ces about vaccination lead to vaccination uptake ,a s shown in the right. Findings from observational studies reliably support the social processes proposition. Social networks are wellcharacterized and show robust clustering of people with similar ideas about vaccination in social spaces. 17Social norms are reliably associated with vaccine uptake,18with somewhat less evidence showing smaller associations forsocial preferences. Behavioral scientists have generatedsubstantial and convincing experimental evidence onthese questions in the context of vaccination, but almostall of it has nonbehavioral outcomes. No published randomized trials to date have established that social process interventions increase vaccine uptake, ContagionVaccination uptake (or refusal, delay)Social preferences Altruism Free-ridingSocial network HomophilySocial space Person's mind Social norms Figure 3.

Some quasiexperimental studies suggest that social processesshow potential, and several currently unpublished studiesmay soon ll this gap. Research on other health behaviors suggests why social process interventions may succeed where thoughts and feelings interventions fail. The \"one communicator andone receiver\" model of education is the way to changewhat people know. However, to change what people do,information must come from multiple people in the per-son's social network. 19,20Such social processes are espe- cially pertinent in an era dened by social media,antivaccine activists, and misinformation. Stories that go viral evoke strong feelings, inc lude rich narrative detail, and offer a simple \"gist\" or take-home message. 21Sci- entists and their research rarely offer any of these things. Experts are bringing research papers to a re-ght and, in doing so, they have lost before they evenstarted talking. The consequence is that antivaccineactivists were, for a while, dominant on many socialmedia platforms. More recently, citizen and scientist activists have fought back with increasingl y effective tools. Examples include the National HPV Vaccination Roundtable whichcreated videos of people affected by HPV cancers andtheir doctors in order to make the consequences of thediseases more vivid. The WHO created a manual foraddressing vaccine deniers in public. 22Shots Heard Round the World developed a rapid-response collective of volunteers to defend health care providers attacked for their vaccine advocacy. Quantifying the impact of anti-and provaccine activism and tools is an important area for new research. TAGGEDH1DIRECT BEHAVIOR CHANGE The third broad proposition in the model is that foster- ing direct behavior change increases vaccine uptake(Fig. 4 ). The general idea is that one can increase vaccine uptake without ever changing what people think and feelor the social world they encounter. Thus, direct behavior change takes motivation as a given. One can build on favorable intentions to vaccinate, pouring gas onto a litre, by keeping vaccination on people's minds and reduc- ing barriers to it. Alternatively, one can ignore intentionsaltogether and shape behavior with incentives, sanction, and requirements \u2014techniques that do not rely on predis- position to vaccinate. These interventions lead to vaccina- tion uptake , shown in the right. One approach to direct behavior change is to build on people's good intentions. That means, rst, to identify thepeople who already intend to vaccinate or are open to it,and then to make it as easy as possible for them to do so.Interventions include keeping vaccination on people'sminds with reminders and prompts and reducing barrierswith default appointments, standing orders, and other logistical and behavioral defaults. Randomized trials gen- erally support the use of building on vaccination inten-tions to increase uptake. Another approach is to shapebehavior with incentives, sanctions, or requirements,including work and school vaccination mandates. Again,randomized trials have repeatedly found support for theeffectiveness of behavior-shaping interventions. The keyshared characteristic of these strategies is that they use policies and practices to increase vaccination without changing what people think or feel. Direct behavior change interventions are the most reliably effective option available, but they do havelimitations. For example, w hile vaccination reminder/ recall interventions are effective, few clinics effectivelyimplement them. In one randomized trial, less than 1%of families received a reminder/recall letter or call when the task was assigned to clinics, but 87% received the notices when the county health department handledthe responsibility. 23Furthermore, notices from a cen- tralized source are more effective when they includethe name of the patient's provider. 23In another exam- ple, school requirements (s ometimes called mandates) effectively increase uptake of most vaccines24but do not raise HPV vaccine uptake among adolescent girls.25 As well, the process of implementing requirements cancreate substantial work f or immunization programs and distract their staff from other essential tasks. 26All of that suggests that the right implementationstrategy is critically important for direct behaviorchange interventions.

T AGGEDH2PROVIDER RECOMMENDATIONS TAGGEDEND By far, the single most potent intervention for increas- ing vaccine uptake is a provider recommendation.27How- ever, it is still unclear whether recommendations areeffective because they increase condence, set a socialnorm, or reflect a direct behavior change technique. Quite possibly, provider recommendations exert influence through all 3 of the model's behavioral propositions. Themost active aspect of the model from the standpoint ofprovider recommendations may be direct behaviorchange, given the few barriers present in many clinics: thevaccine is in stock, staff can deliver it, and a state pro-gram or private insurance generally covers the cost.Given that providers have more power than patients in clinical interactions, injun c t i v es o c i a ln o r m sa r ea l s o l i k e l yt op l a ys o m er o l e .I tm a ye v e nb et h a tp r o v i d e r spersuasively shape what people think and feel bybuilding on their unique relationship with the familiesthey see. Research is needed to elucidate basic ques-tions about what makes provider recommendationsmost effective. While most evidence for provider recommendations is correlational, several trials have focused on the impact of training providers to communicate more effectively aboutvaccination. In my own research, 28colleagues and I have trained providers to raise the topic of adolescent vaccina-tion using presumptive language 29that we call an \"announcement\" and then to use a structured communica-tion approach if questions come up. A presumptiveannouncement might sound like this: \"Now that Sophia is 12, she is due for 3 vaccines. Today, she'll get vaccines against meningitis, HPV cancers, and whooping cough.\"The Announcement Approach Training is a 1-hour, physi-cian-led, in-clinic training, offered with continuing medi-cal education credits (materials are available at hpvIQ.org). The training increased HPV vaccine uptake by 5%within 3 months 28and has now been delivered to over 1700 providers in the United States and the United King- dom. This communication approach builds on direct behavior change principles by assuming most parents justneed a prompt to vaccinate. T AGGEDH2INTERACTIONS AMONG THE PROPOSITIONS TAGGEDEND No strong data are available to explain how the 3 parts of the model interact, but I offer my own specula-tion, based on corre lational studies and insights I have gathered from people on the frontlines of vaccination. First, although interven tions to change what people think and feel may not change behavior directly, they may provide other indirect benets. Most of the policiesand programs aimed at direct behavior change \u2014by far the most effective way to incr ease vaccination uptake \u2014 require public condence in vaccination. Thus, interven-tions that increase vaccine condence may create anenvironment that supports direct behavior change inter- ventions. Second, interventions to change social processes may also change what people think and feel about diseases andvaccination. Although this has not yet been well-docu- mented in the context of vaccination, it is a reasonable speculation based on social network studies in other areas. Third, implementing direct behavior change interven- tions almost certainly affects other parts of the model. Forexample, establishing or removing vaccine recommenda-tions, or imposing requirements for certain vaccines,likely affects condence in vaccination. Similarly, leadersstanding up for existing policies may bolster condence, while setting the policies aside in the face of public oppo- sition may erode condence in vaccination. T AGGEDH2GLOBAL SETTINGS TAGGEDEND Most vaccination intervention studies are from the United States, and some are from other high-income coun-tries. Only a handful of intervention studies from low- andmiddle-income countries have examined vaccinationincentives and educational programs. While these havegenerally shown the same results as studies in high- income countries, caution is warranted in applying the interventions to global settings until formative work isdone within the local communities and perhaps trial-levelevaluations are conducted. Such research could be a 2-way street, with vaccination programs in high-incomecountries benetting from learning what is effective inincreasing vaccine uptake in low- and middle-incomecountries. T AGGEDH2TIMELINESS AND STABILITY TAGGEDEND The available evidence primarily examines vaccine uptake. Because few studies are available on vaccinationtimeliness and stability, application of the model to theseoutcomes remains preliminary and warrants additionalstudy. An area of growing interest is understandingwhat leads to and sustains the resilience of vaccinationprograms. TAGGEDH1ADAPTATION OF THE MODEL BY WHO Following on WHO's designation of vaccine hesi- tancy as one of the top 10 threats to global publichealth, the agency established an expert working group to identify the behavioral and social drivers of vacci- nation uptake around the world. The working grouphas adapted the Increasing Vaccination Model, asshown in Figure 5 , as the basis for its work. The boxes in the model have remained the same over time, evenas the working group has continued to winnow the listvariables in each box. Among the noteworthy highlights from that adaptation: /C15The box for what people think and feel does not include risk appraisals. The working group startedwith a childhood vaccine survey, but parents struggledto think about vaccine-preventable infections withoutTAGGEDENDACADEMIC PEDIATRICS WHATWORKS TO INCREASE VACCINATION UPTAKE S13specic examples. The group has incorporated risk appraisals in later surveys on specic vaccines (eg,coronavirus disease 2019). /C15Motivation to vaccinate is in its own box, allowing the working group to emphasize the difference betweencondence and hesitancy. /C15Provider recommendation is in the social process box. This categorization was not a settled issue in the origi-nal paper, but it allowed the working group to keeptrack of this important variable. /C15The direct behavior change box is renamed \"practical issues\" and drops the distinction between building onfavorable intentions and shaping behavior. Many working group members had roles in vaccinationprograms globally, which led them to see observable barriers and practical issues as especially important. They felt that the new name emphasized barriers thatsurveys can measure and vaccination programs canaddress. Before using the Increasing Vaccination Model, the working group had not engaged with the several conceptsrelated to social processes. The model caused a shift in their thinking in that domain, leading the group to Vaccination Child receives recommended vaccinesMotivation Intention to get recommended vaccines for childPractical issues Know where vaccine is available Ease of access Affordability Service quality Respect from providerWhat people think and feel Confidence in vaccine benefits Confidence in vaccine safety Confidence in provider Religious beliefs Social processes Provider recommendation Family supports vaccination Community supports vaccination Gender equity Figure 5.

Impact of Interventions to Increase Vaccination Uptake TAGGEDENDS14 BREWER ACADEMIC PEDIATRICSconsider the roles of families, community leaders, and gender equity. Based on their adapted model, the WHOworking group has developed a survey on the behavioraland social drivers of vaccination around the world. Thesurvey is being piloted in 6 low- and middle-income coun- tries and should be available for use globally in 2021. TAGGEDH1CONCLUSION Direct behavior change is clearly the most promising approach to increasing vaccination uptake and researchsupports the use of many different techniques, as shown atthe bottom of Table . 1No single intervention is effective on its own, however, making it necessary to adopt more than one. Insofar as each intervention acts on differentparts of the system that provides vaccination, their combi-nation may be truly additive or even multiplicative in theireffects. It is also possible that the initial intervention acti-vates the \"easy\" cases to vaccinate, and that additionalinterventions add little. More information is needed onthis topic, but given the high cost of trials, and the dif- culty in evaluating the impact of individual factors in mul- ticomponent interventions, such knowledge may be out ofreach. In contrast, interventions to change what people think and feel are often expensive and hard to sustain, andthey may not be especially effective (as shown at thetop of Table ). An important caveat here is that interven- tions by health care professionals in clinical settings may be influential if they effectively use communica- tion approaches based on information, persuasion, andengaged listening. Interventions targeting social processes are promising insofar as they build on multiple nodes of social networksor happen in clinical settings. In this era of social mediaand vocal vaccine activism, the conversations about vac-cination, both in the public sphere and in private settings, have an outsized influence on programs and policies. What this adds up to remains to be seen, but research isunderway that should shed light on the pitfalls and prom-ises of social processes. Thinking more broadly about public support for vacci- nation, work is needed to understand how to ensure resil-ience in the face of safety scares. Interventions to boostvaccine condence may not increase vaccination uptake directly, but they may have a side benet of increasing support for effective policies and programs. Interventionsthrough social media \u2014to add supportive stories and infor- mation or to limit misinformation \u2014may also increase vac- cination support. Other strategies can also be considered,including targeted efforts when new vaccines are launchedand to address unsubstantiated vaccine scares; indeed, dataare accumulating to support the value of efforts by coun- tries to bolster condence during such scares. 3 As we move into a new decade, it is essential to ensure the resilience of vaccination programs, and the global suc-cess story they represent. The Increasing VaccinationModel offers important insights to support such efforts.Building on the large existing body of evidence canensure a steady path forward for vaccination programs globally.
