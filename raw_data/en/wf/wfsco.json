The CAPER reports performance for the following federal housing and community development block grants: Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME), National Housing Trust Fund (NHTF), Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG), Housing Opportunities for Persons with HIV/AIDS (HOPWA). The CAPER is typically filed in September of each year, due 60-days after the end of block grant program years. The CAPER is made available for public review for 15 days prior to HUD submittal. This CAPER covers the program year 2021 (PY21), which runs from July 1, 2021 through June 30, 2022. The CAPER follows a template prescribed by HUD. Content and structure include: An introduction that compares the amount of funds allocated by block grant and program activity to the funds expended during the program year; A HUD matrix that tracks progress toward 5-year and annual goals; A discussion of how well the state fulfilled its goals, including program changes made to meet the needs that emerged during the year; Demographic characteristics of program beneficiaries as available; Leveraging of block grant funds; Other actions the state took during the program year to address needs; and Monitoring procedures to ensure fund compliance. Appendices to the CAPER include the public notice for draft review and supplement reports detailing block grant expenditures. CR-05 - Goals and Outcomes Progress the jurisdiction has made in carrying out its strategic plan and its action plan. 91.520(a) The planned allocation, commitment, and disbursements of funds during PY21 is summarized below and in the goals and outcomes matrix: CDBG: Public with $3,345,494.79disbursed.

OCRA's CDBG distribution during PY21 was much different than in a traditional year, with far more funding allocated for direct service activities through the CARES Act to help residents and businesses manage the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Funds were allocated to public facilities and improvements and direct business assistance. OCRA also allocated funds for public services related to supporting mental health care and food pantry services, increasing internet access and technology equity, and addressing lost access to social supports for adults with disabilities which it typically does not fund. OCRA does not usually report outcomes by persons served due to the nature of the activities funded in a typical program year. As such, the outcomes matrix above measures facilities or projects funded (v. persons or households benefitting from those improvements). During PY21, funding allocations are estimated result in the following: Preservation of jobs for 1,570 workers; Rehabilitation of business facilities to benefit another 1,574 workers; Public facility improvements to benefit 630,000 residents; and Public services to benefit 197,300 residents. Through the HOME program, 135 units of affordable housing were added through new construction and rehabilitation activities. An RFP was released for HOME-ARP activities to create new units of supportive housing for persons experiencing homelessness and at risk of homelessness. Housing Trust Fund was awarded as gap financing for permanent supportive housing developments through the LIHTC application round and has been offered to projects that will be selected through the HOME-ARP RFP.

The table above excludes multi-racial households, which totaled 18,507 people. Efforts to collect more data on the ethnic and the racial composition of beneficiaries have been delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic recovery. While these data fields have not yet been added to OCRA's new grants management system (GMS), in PY2021, OCRA actively sought ways to continue incentivizing applications that included a focus on supporting Minority-, Women-, or Veteran-Owned Businesses through its COVID-19 Response Program. Additional points were awarded by the OCRA Scoring Committee when evaluating these projects to facilitate and advance equitable policies that support long-term economic growth for businesses and populations disproportionally impacted by the pandemic. Routinizing a plan to collect this information in eGMS remains on OCRA's list of priority eGMS projects. While OCRA has not been able to implement a plan for collecting this information as yet, the agency is working with the LGs Business Office to create a new position that will serve as the primary system admin for OCRA's eGMS portal. The purpose of this new role will be to increase the state's capacity to design and execute needed eGMS improvements, like this, so that OCRA can more effectively track this type of data for reporting planning and reporting purposes. The table excludes 3 multi-racial households who were assisted with HOME. HOME beneficiaries include new rental construction and TBRA; program beneficiaries were mostly White (177 of 220, or 80%) and, secondarily, African American (42 of 220, or 19%). Of these beneficiaries, 217 had incomes less than 60% of AMI and all had incomes less than 80% of AMI. The majority (136 households) had incomes less than 30% AMI. Fourteen multi-racial households were assisted with HOPWA. The NHTF allocation subsidizes new construction and rehabilitation of affordable housing. During PY21, funds were deployed for new construction and those projects will be completed in future program years. As such, the racial and ethnic composition of families assisted by the NHTF in the current program year is unknown. The table excludes 508 multi-racial households assisted with ESG and 112 households where the data was not collected.

Draws constituted: PY18\u2014none IHCDA's PY21 HOME Rental Round was opened in March of 2022 with applications due in May of 2022. IHCDA's Board of Directors approved those projects in August of 2022. Funded projects then undergo the Environmental Review (ERR); once that has been completed and the project has Release of Funds (ROF), IHCDA executes the HOME contracts, and commits funds in IDIS. IHCDA is in the process of finalizing the FY 2021 ERR and will continue to commit funds once projects have ROF. Through this round, IHCDA funded 10 projects (7 CHDO and 3 non-CHDO projects), culminating in an anticipated 75 units across nine counties. IHCDA has continued to accept applications to the HOME Homebuyer program on a rolling basis; contracts also follow the same approval process. IHCDA awarded seven recipients funds under this program- four CHDO and three non-CHDO projects, culminating in an anticipated 20 homebuyer units. In addition, IHCDA used HOME as supplemental funding in conjunction with its LIHTC program; applications were due in July of 2021, with funding approved by IHCDA Board of Directors in November of 2021. IHCDA funded 1 NHTF project through this round. Each was still undergoing ERR and Section 106 review at the end of PY21. IHCDA released a competitive Request for Proposal in December 2021 as part of the HOME Innovative round, open to non-profit developers to apply for HOME funding to support development of HOME-assisted units for individuals with co-occurring substance use disorder and mental illness. Three non-profits were selected for this initiative and underwent a multi-course training on HOME regulations and best practices in affordable and permanent supportive housing development. As of the publication of this CAPER, each team is working on their final concept. Applications for each are expected to be submitted during FY2022. IHCDA continues to operate the HOME-TBRA program, with a focus to help income qualified households pay for housing costs including rent, security deposits, and utility CAPER 11 OMB Control No: 2506-0117 (exp. 06/30/2018) deposits. IHCDA focuses its TBRA program on providing rental assistance for formerly incarcerated individuals, defined as 1) individuals exiting the corrections system within six months who are at risk of homelessness due to a lack of stable housing, 2) individuals currently experiencing homelessness who were formerly incarcerated, and 3) individuals who were formerly incarcerated and are currently experiencing a housing crisis where enrollment in the HOME-TBRA Program would prevent an eviction. According to the HTF Activity Status Report (PR100), IHCDA committed NHTF funding to 1 project during the program year, totaling $1,031,764. None of the funds have been drawn. Through the Indiana Permanent Supportive Housing Institute, seven teams successfully completed during FY2021 and will have preference in applications for special funding from HOME-ARP and NHTF. Identify the geographic distribution and location of investments Target Area Planned Percentage of Allocation Actual Percenta ge of Allocation Narrative Description N/A N/A N/A N/A Table 4 - Identify the geographic distribution and location of investments Narrative The State of Indiana does not prioritize the allocation of CDBG, HOME or ESG geographically. Instead, the state identifies the greatest needs for the state and non-entitlement areas overall and this information is used to guide the funding priorities for each program year. For local needs, the state relies on the information presented in block grant program funding applications. OCRA CDBG scoring criteria consider community distress factors. The factors used in the Community Distress factor calculation include: Percentage of Households with Income under Poverty Level Median Household Income Percent of Housing Units that are Vacant Median Home Value Unemployment Rate Labor Force Participation IHCDA scoring criteria for HOME applications include preferences for developments that: commit to meeting the needs of extremely low- and very low-income households implement strategies for accessibility and aging-in-place utilize energy-efficient and high-quality design features include MBE/WBE/DBE and Veteran-owned business participation contribute to community revitalization CAPER 12 OMB Control No: 2506-0117 (exp. 06/30/2018) IHCDA's competitive HOME Rental Round and rolling HOME Buyer Round are open for projects located only within non-participating jurisdictions. NHTF, on the other hand, may be used throughout the entire state. Additionally, HOME requested with NHTF to develop supportive housing associated with the Indiana SH Institute may be used in Participating and non-participating Jurisdictions, alike. ESG allocates emergency shelter and rapid re-housing activities statewide; homeless prevention and outreach activities are more targeted geographically. IHCDA has created caps for each of these categories to focus funding on housing individuals. ESG sub-recipients are selected through a Request for Proposals process each year. Submitted applicants are scored based on capacity, compliance, and proposed activities. These are then reviewed by IHCDA staff and the CoC BoS board for recommendations to the IHCDA board for final approval. The HOPWA grant does rely on a geographic allocation. Within the State of Indiana there are 12 HIV Care Coordination Regions as established by the Indiana State Department of Health (ISDH). IHCDA currently provides funding to 7 organizations who have consistently applied for funding each year. The application is open to all organization established as a Care Coordination Site. Each HOPWA sponsor is selected by a Request for Qualifications process that solicited applications from the Indiana Department of Health care coordination sites. HOPWA awards were then determined by meeting required thresholds and then based on their proposed budget needs, proposed activities, current housing needs and the ISDH-published HIV/AIDS epidemiology reports from the previous year. These are then reviewed by IHCDA staff and recommendations are made to the IHCDA board for final approval. CAPER 13 OMB Control No: 2506-0117 (exp. 06/30/2018) Leveraging and Match Explain how federal funds leveraged additional resources (private, state and local funds), including a description of how matching requirements were satisfied, as well as how any publicly owned land or property located within the jurisdiction that were used to address the needs identified in the plan. OCRA defines leverage as the non-match cash or non-match in-kind resources committed to making a project fully operational. This includes all resources in excess of the required match for each program as well as other resources that are used on ineligible costs. Leverage may be used to support any activity within the project provided by the recipient or subrecipient. Federal, state, and local government grants are considered eligible match. The eligible local match can be local cash, debt, or in-kind sources. In- kind sources may provide eligible local match for the project, but the amount that can be counted as the local match is limited to 5% of the total project budget or a maximum of $25,000. Use of in-kind donations as eligible match requires approval from the CDBG Program Director approximately one week before application submission (date of the deadline will be announced each round). Contributions that supported CDBG awards in 2020 and exceeded match included: $1,981,266 of contributions beyond the match required for the Stellar program; $92,358 for the Brownfield Clearance Program; $12,498 for program; $3,275,735 for the streets/sidewalks improvement program; and $28,539,169 for the water and wastewater program. Altogether, $33.9 million in non-match donations helped leverage CDBG awards in 2020. The sources of the non-match donations were varied and included some local funds but also the State Revolving Loan Funds, USDA-RD funds, and municipal bonds, among others. In PY21, OCRA was able to successfully modify the application in eGMS to collect more details on the primary source(s) of any eligible match or leverage for CDBG funded projects. OCRA will be able to provide details on the amount of non-match donations/leverage by source beginning with projects funded in 2022 Round 1. HUD allowed a waiver of the HOME match requirements during 2021. Because of this, IHCDA eliminated the requirement for PY 2021 for the state of Indiana due to the extended impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, projects that were closed out from October 1, 2020 through Sept 30, 2021 brought $246,667 in match and used $0 in banked match, for a net increase in available match of $246,667. The total available match to be carried over is $5,558,883.26. Sources included donated land, donated labor, cash donations, waived fees, tax abatement, below market rate financing and grants made directly to the projects. Public funding leveraged for HOPWA included: Ryan White-Housing Assistance $252,751 Ryan funding leveraged by the HOPWA program included $10,291 in agency cash for a total of $4.265,890. Matching funds for ESG included: ESG Match Total $3,543,295 Other non- ESG HUD $378, 276 Other Federal Grants $752,113 State Government $1,513,211 Local Government $899,695 Cash total $2,183,979 In-kind total $1,359,316 Fiscal Year Summary - HOME Match 1.

Supply chain delays and increases in construction costs continue to put pressure on housing developers, causing revised budgets and additional funding requests. Project completion is taking longer than previous years due to these factors. Discuss how these outcomes will impact future annual action plans. As state staff have focused on responding to needs arising from the pandemic, deployment of regular block grant funding rounds continue to experience delays. Due to the prioritization of CARES Act/CV funds, the limited capacity of providers, and delays in construction, non-CV funds will take longer to deploy and will carry forward into future program years. CAPER 20 OMB Control No: 2506-0117 (exp. 06/30/2018) IHCDA is evaluating the longer-term impacts of increased costs of construction and growing needs for affordable housing as the economic impacts of COVID-19 become more significant. Gap financing has been made available for projects experiencing cost increases due to the impacts of COVID-19. IHCDA is also evaluating it's per unit subsidy cap and if those limitations are negativity impacting the number of units funded. Include the number of extremely low-income, low-income, and moderate-income persons served by each activity where information on income by family size is required to determine the eligibility of the activity.

Narrative Number of extremely low-income renter households- 136 Number of of homeless persons served- 10,326 Number of owner and renter households assisted that meet the Section 215 definition- 107 housing units provided by HOME meet the Section 215 criteria The source of the CDBG LMI households served is the CDBG Summary of Accomplishments report. This report does not contain information on beneficiaries by tenure for CDBG-funded activities. The source of the HOME LMI households served is the HOME Summary of Accomplishments report and includes activity from rental construction projects and TBRA. The IHCDA Board approved projects for PY2021 were targeted toward assisting low-income households: 10.67% percent are expected to serve households below 30 percent AMI once complete; 45.33% percent, 31-50% AMI households; and the remaining 44%, 50.1-60% AMI households. These developments will provide housing for 24 senior households; 10 households with special needs residents; and 41 family households. CAPER 21 OMB Control No: 2506-0117 (exp. 06/30/2018) Since the beginning of the NHTF program, IHCDA has funded 17 projects, committing a total of $17,857,535, while disbursing $8,556.031, for a current expenditure rate of 48%. HOPWA beneficiaries Included 477 individuals with HIV/AIDs who qualified to receive HOPWA housing assistance\u2014277 were extremely low income, 67 were very low income, and 27 were low income. Efforts to address worst case housing needs Worst case needs during PY21 included: 1) Risks of eviction and foreclosure and homelessness from job losses related to the pandemic, 2) Risks of business closures and job losses related to the pandemic, and 3) Declining health, both physical and mental, of residents. The state prioritized use of CARES/CV funds to address these needs. On April 18, 2021, OCRA awarded an additional $18.6 million in federal grant funding to 80 communities in a 3rd phase of it's COVID-19 Response Grant Program. In total, OCRA awarded 191 grants to 142 communities (totaling more than $38 million in funding) through the COVID-19 Response Program Phases 1, 2 and 3. OCRA awarded bonus points for minority/ women/veteran-owned businesses for COVID-19 Response in Phase 2 and 3. The CARES Act (CDBG- CV) also provided waivers allowing OCRA to aid both non entitlement and entitlement communities in Phase 2 and 3 with preparing, preventing and responding to the COVID-19 public health crisis. In PY2021, OCRA also launched the Connecting Communities and People with Disabilities (CCPWD) grant opportunity in partnership with the Indiana Division of Disability and Rehabilitative Services (DDRS). CCPWD grant funds were intended to encourage ULUGs and their partner organizations to develop strategies, including virtual and/or technology assisted activities, to respond to or mitigate the negative social, economic and health effects of COVID-19 for the target population. Funded with CDBG-CV, the program required ULUGs to enter into a partnership with a qualifying developmental disability (DD) organization that serves Hoosiers with disabilities. On Feb. 11, 2021, OCRA announced 11 communities were awarded $1.63 million CDBG-CV funds through CCPWD. On Aug. 20, 2021, OCRA announced 12 communities were awarded $1.58 million CDBG-CV funds through CCPWD. ESG-CV funds provided a considerable impact on homeless prevention, with over $18 million dollars allocated for rental assistance since the beginning of funding. The majority of that funding, $13 million, was distributed during the 2021-2022 program year. In addition, ESG-CV funding was expanded to include emergency shelters, street outreach, and rapid rehousing. To date, there have been 42 CAPER 22 OMB Control No: 2506-0117 (exp. 06/30/2018) Emergency Shelter projects funded ($7,882,287); 16 Rapid Rehousing projects funded ($2,917,407); and 11 Street Outreach projects funded CAPER 23 OMB Control No: 2506-0117 (exp. 91.320(d, e); 91.520(c) Evaluate the jurisdiction's progress in meeting its specific objectives for reducing and ending homelessness through: Reaching out to homeless persons (especially unsheltered persons) and assessing their individual needs The state relies on its partners to conduct outreach to persons who are homeless, assess their needs and communicate these needs to the state. To that end, during the program year, the state: Required all HUD McKinney Vento Funded programs to utilize HMIS for all shelter or transitional housing or permanent supportive housing programs serving homeless individuals and families. Required all HUD McKinney Vento Funded programs to participate in the annual, statewide homeless Point-in-Time Count in late January and timely submission of this data to IHCDA. Required all HUD McKinney Vento Funded programs subrecipients actively participate in their Regional Planning Council on the Homeless meetings regularly (minimum 75% attendance). Required all HUD McKinney Vento Funded programs to participate in the Coordinated Access in their Region as it is implemented in their area. These requirements will continue into current and future program years. Addressing the emergency shelter and transitional housing needs of homeless persons The state relies on data and its partners to address the emergency shelter needs. In PY21, there were 5 street outreach programs funded with ESG; 52 emergency shelter programs funded; and 13 rapid rehousing projects funded. No transitional housing projects were funded. IHCDA was also awarded over $30 million in ESG-CV funds starting in March 2020. These funds addressed the need for homeless shelters to be improved or updated to meet the high need. These organizations were all required to participate in the Point In Time (PIT) count and Housing Inventory Chart (HIC) process. The HIC in particular helped the state understand the need for sheltering homeless persons. The involvement in this data collection ensures the needs of individuals served by these funds are counted. IHCDA then uses the results of the PIT and HIC to consider strategy on future funding opportunities. In addition to the allocation of ESG funds, homeless, emergency shelter, and transitional housing needs were addressed through the ESG funded organization's participation in their local Regional Planning Council on Homeless in their Region. This communication allows for on the ground information to be shared in real time and for organizations who address these needs to work together. In addition, the CoC Board committees have been updated and ESG is part of the work of each committee in some way or another. IHCDA partners closely with the CoC board around their ESG funds and sub-recipient results. The CAPER 24 OMB Control No: 2506-0117 (exp. 06/30/2018) strategies of that board help inform IHCDA's work with ESG funding. The strategic objectives of the CoC Board are: Decrease shelter stays by increasing rapid rehousing to stable housing. Reduce recidivism of households experiencing homelessness. Decrease the number of Veterans experiencing homelessness. Decrease the number of persons experiencing Chronic Homelessness. Create new permanent supportive housing beds for chronically homeless persons. Increase the percentage of participants remaining in CoC funded permanent housing projects for at least six months to 86% or more. Decrease the number of homeless households with children. Increase the number of rental assistance programs and services. Increase the percentage of participants in ESG-funded rental assistance programs that move into permanent housing to 82% or more. Increase the percentage of participants in all CoC funded transitional housing that move into permanent housing to 70 percent or more. Increase the percentage of participants in CoC funded projects that are employed at exit to 38% or higher. Increase persons experiencing homelessness access to mainstream resources. Collaborate with local education agencies to assist in the identification of homeless families and inform them of their eligibility for McKinney-Vento education services. Improve homeless outreach and coordinated access to housing and services. Improve HMIS data quality and coverage, and use data to develop strategies and policies to end homelessness. Develop effective discharge plans and programs for individuals leaving State Operated Facilities at risk of homelessness. These actions and strategies will continue into the future. Moreover, the CoC has DV Bonus Funds that allow for domestic violence survivors to be prioritized with housing. A portion of these funds were TH- RRH funds to assist with DV survivor transitional housing. These funds will continue to be allocated across the balance of state. The CoC Board and IHCDA staff have completed the initial work on updating their strategic plan. This plan was finalized through a retreat and planning process in June 2022. This process was initially pushed back due to the pandemic. A report will be finalized at the November 2022 board meeting with the plan beginning in January 2023. This update will create clear metrics and goals to communicate how the State will further focus and address the needs of individuals and families currently and potentially experiencing homelessness. The most recent overview of initiatives can be found here: https://www.in.gov/ihcda/indiana-balance-of-state-continuum-of-care/initiatives-overview/ Helping low-income individuals and families avoid becoming homeless, especially extremely CAPER 25 OMB Control No: 2506-0117 (exp. 06/30/2018) low-income individuals and families and those who are: likely to become homeless after being discharged from publicly funded institutions and systems of care (such as health care facilities, mental health facilities, foster care and other youth facilities, and corrections programs and institutions); and, receiving assistance from public or private agencies that address housing, health, social services, employment, education, or youth needs The state has worked to assist extremely low income individuals and families avoid homelessness. Outreach and partnerships across the state continue to be a method for coordinating care. This is primarily done through the IHCDA staff connections as well as the CoC Board of Directors and network. Since 2020, the Community Services team at IHCDA created a program to assist those on the verge of homelessness and bolstered their relationships with other statewide entities to impact low income families and those who are likely to become homeless. This rental assistance program was created to assist in homeless prevention for low income families and individuals affected by COVID-19. These funds were funneled through the ESG-CV award where IHCDA used homeless prevention dollars to offer rental assistance to those on the verge of eviction. As other funding was brought into Indiana, the goals of the ESG-CV funding shifted to include more opportunities for Rapid Rehousing, Shelter Operations, and Street Outreach. Through recruitment of new CoC BoS board members, IHCDA has a variety of new connections that have helped with this. There are now representatives from the Foster Success (an organization for those aging out of foster care), the Corporation for Supportive Housing (CSH), the Indiana Department of Veteran Affairs and Indiana Coalition to end Sexual Assault and Human Trafficking.. Through the BoS CoC committees, IHCDA now has partnerships with Foster USA (an Evansville based foster care organization), the Indiana Department of Veterans Affairs, and with the South Bend Youth Service Board. Other outreach efforts have been made to expand additional resources and benefits. State partnerships continue to grow with the Indiana Department of Workforce Development, Family Social Services Authority, Indiana Commission for Higher Education, the Department of Corrections (DoC), and the Indiana State Department of Health. The Director of Homeless Services continues to coordinate with that agency to plan for those transitioning out of incarceration. During the shut down, she instructed DOC staff on how to assist individuals who were positives with COVID-19 and in need of shelter after leaving incarceration. She also introduced them to the HIC to help them understand the type of beds and where they are available. IHCDA also strengthened a relationship with FSSA to offer isolation shelter to individuals/families experiencing homelessness who needed a place to quarantine after a positive COVID-19 test. In 2022, the agency has been contracted by the Indiana Department of Education to develop a two-year program that will include hiring Regional Navigators. These Navigators will be tasked with working with the McKinney-Vento Coordinators in local school systems. Each Navigator will be creating systems maps of available resources and connecting youth and their families who are experiencing housing instability CAPER 26 OMB Control No: 2506-0117 (exp. 06/30/2018) with community resources. Lastly, they are finalizing a partnership with the Indiana Department of Health to create a planning and prevention project for infectious disease in homeless shelters and encampments as part of an ongoing effort to mitigate the spread of infections like COVID and educate that agency on the needs of individuals experiencing homelessness during a pandemic. ISDH also helped educate regional chairs and funded organizations on best practices to keep their clients safe and housed. IHCDA continue this education to other external partners on their efforts through out the pandemic and around the homelessness arena. This included the Primary Care Association of Indiana which educates and coordinates local health care organizations including Federally Qualified Health Clinics (FQHCs). Looking ahead, IHCDA is shifting the Community Services division to align more fully under the new Deputy Executive of Programs. This means coordination with CSBG and LIHEAP funding which will help meet the needs of additional low income individuals and families. Helping homeless persons (especially chronically homeless individuals and families, families with children, veterans and their families, and unaccompanied youth) make the transition to permanent housing and independent living, including shortening the period of time that individuals and families experience homelessness, facilitating access for homeless individuals and families to affordable housing units, and preventing individuals and families who were recently homeless from becoming homeless again The state has several avenues to address helping homeless persons make the transition to permanent house including shortening the time families and individuals experience homelessness. They do so through funding and partnership opportunities to assist those serving the homeless population on the ground. These were strengthened in the last year and will continue to grow in the future through the revamped strategic plan. To decrease the amount of time individuals and families experience homelessness, the state has several funding sources to assist in that area. Rapid re-housing activities include housing relocation and stabilization services and financial assistance with rent, utilities, arrears, and deposits. The function of these funds is to provide short-term assistance to individuals and families. The state offers shelters a version of RRH that did not include rental assistance, and instead covers one time assistance to support a direct connection from shelter to permanent housing including housing relocation and stabilization services, utilities, arrears, and deposits. IHCDA continued to improve knowledge of sub-recipients in implementing Rapid Re-housing and Prevention services in their communities through an all-day training symposium on RRH and HMIS training about the new data elements to collect and analyze. Historically, the state has provided TANF block grant dollars as well as ESG funds to rapidly rehouse individuals and families with the TANF funds specifically targeting families. However, TANF funds for rapid rehousing are currently on hold due to the COVID pandemic. To move individuals towards more permanent housing and independent living, the state has funding and resources to provide to organizations. The state offers a permanent support housing institute that CAPER 27 OMB Control No: 2506-0117 (exp. 06/30/2018) builds PSH units across the state. Through the Housing Choice Voucher program, IHCDA has a set aside of \"Moving On\" section 8 vouchers for those currently in supportive housing who can move on to a more traditional housing choice voucher. Additionally, through the Emergency Housing Voucher (EHV) program, IHCDA coordinated the required use of Coordinated Entry (CE) for referrals to public housing authorities (PHA). They are also working through a partnership to support individuals with the vouchers at Community Mental Health Centers (CMHCs). IHCDA is also the collaborative applicant for the CoC PSH funds that are awarded to organizations across the balance of state. The state works across its division and in conjunction with the CoC board to create strategy for moving individuals and families out of homelessness. In addition, resources have been built and will continue to be built to provide individuals and families the resources they need to move on from homelessness. A persistent barrier to the transition to permanent housing is lack of employment. This remains especially difficult in rural areas. Lack of affordable housing availability continues to be a key factor in extended lengths of stay in shelter while the housing search is in process. Another issue in housing stock is the ability to match individuals off the Coordinated Entry list. IHCDA has improved relationship with the Department of Workforce development, the Indiana Commission for Higher Education, and with the HOME team at IHCDA to combat these issues. For the challenges of Coordinated Entry, IHCDA has hired a CE Manager who is working to overhaul the system including the assessment tool. These and other challenges should also be addressed through the 2022 strategic plan with the CoC BoS board that should be made available in late 2021. CAPER 28 OMB Control Public Housing 91.220(h); 91.320(j) Actions taken to address the needs of public housing IHCDA is a Section 8 public housing authority (PHA) and serves Housing Choice Voucher holders in many of the state's rural areas. IHCDA is a high performing PHA. IHCDA does not maintain public housing developments and, as such, its public housing needs are unlike a PHA that maintains an inventory of housing units. Per 24 CFR 92.214 (a)(4), HOME funds may not be invested in public housing projects. HOME dollars can be used by nonprofits that partner with PHAs, and rental tax credits can be awarded to PHAs. However, IHCDA does not currently give PHAs preferences in rental tax credit awards. IHCDA has provided capital funding through bond issuances and the 4% RHTC program for Public Housing properties around the state that underwent a RAD conversion and required capital investment to preserve the asset. IHCDA's mission includes maintaining affordability for Hoosiers and IHCDA will continue to support Public Housing that is scheduled for RAD conversion and requires capital investment. Actions taken to encourage public housing residents to become more involved in management and participate in homeownership N/A; the State does not own or operate public housing developments, nor does IHCDA have a practice of providing assistance to troubled PHAs. Per 24 CFR 92.214 (a)(4), HOME funds may not be invested in public housing projects. HOME dollars can be used by nonprofits that partner with PHAs, and rental tax credits can be awarded to PHAs. However, IHCDA does not currently give PHAs preferences in rental tax credit awards. Within the HCV program, IHCDA partners with local community action programs around the state to offer services to HCV participants that help build skills and assets to promote self-sufficiency. Actions taken to provide assistance to troubled PHAs 29 OMB Actions 91.220(j)-(k); 91.320(i)-(j) Actions taken to remove or ameliorate the negative effects of public policies that serve as barriers to affordable housing such as land use controls, tax policies affecting land, zoning ordinances, building codes, fees and charges, growth limitations, and policies affecting the return on residential investment. 91.220 (j); 91.320 (i) The state consistently evaluates barriers to affordable housing development\u2014including public policies, land use and zoning regulations, and program delivery. OCRA routinely conducts stakeholder outreach about how its programs can best respond to the most pressing needs of non entitlement communities. Barriers that have been identified by stakeholders concern private practices such as tenant screening requirements (which adversely affect persons with disabilities, voucher holders, residents with criminal histories or substance abuse challenges, and people of color); lack of fair housing knowledge among small landlords; and predatory lending products that are disproportionately targeted to persons of color. OCRA completed a series of in-person meetings (15 total) with local grant administrators and regional planning organizations in PY21 to gather feedback on OCRA's current programs. During this meeting, we received diverse input on evolving needs and opportunities in non-entitlement communities post pandemic, along with ways to improve its CDBG program delivery. Additionally, OCRA has contracted one of our university partners (BSU ICI) to do an in-depth evaluation of past performance for OCRA's Main Street Revitalization Program (MSRP). This program was suspended throughout PY21 due to COVID-19. The scope of work includes an analysis of the revised goals and programmatic changes for the MSRP program originally proposed in the 2020 Consolidated Plan. The resultant report will include updated policy and program recommendations on the viability of these potential changes post-pandemic, along with implementation strategies. The State is updating its Analysis of Impediments in PY22 and will evaluate negative effects of public policies including land use controls, tax policies affecting land use, state-prescribed zoning codes, building codes, and other state regulations. Actions taken to address obstacles to meeting underserved needs. 91.220(k); 91.320(j) The state has primarily addressed underserved needs by focusing on getting money into local communities more efficiently in accordance with the State's Next Level Agenda and commitment to good government service. The COVID-19 pandemic has elevated the importance of this strategy. OCRA has streamlined the grant application process to move CDBG more quickly into communities and to make grants awarded more impactful. These changes include: Changing the information OCRA requests when a community applies for funding, helping to more effectively define the scope of a proposed project and the technical assistance needed, CAPER 30 OMB Control No: 2506-0117 (exp. 06/30/2018) which allows communities to make adjustments and increase their application's competitiveness; Implementing a new electronic grants management system (eGMS) to better assess data and process applications; Utilizing new virtual meeting technologies to facilitate safe attendance at CDBG trainings and to promote the timelier delivery of technical assistance needed by communities; Adding additional program staff to serve as subject matter experts which supports increased compliance with the specific requirements, flexibilities, and waivers of any funds awarded through the CARES Act (CDBG-CV), CDBG, etc.; Quickly pivoting with the pandemic to meet the needs related to the response; and Reallocating funds to ensure obligation and expenditure rates. To address limited capacity to respond to affordable housing needs in non-entitlement areas\u2014which has been made more severe during the pandemic\u2014IHCDA has implemented several efforts to support local affordable housing development. IHCDA continues to allow for HOME awards of up to $1 million for non-CHDO projects and has increased the subsidy/unit limits to allow for more applications that would not be financially feasible otherwise. For non-profit partners certifying as CHDOs, IHCDA has changed the policy to allow for those entities to do a \"pre-qualification.\" If the entity meets the CHDO requirement, they may apply for up to $1.5 million of HOME. IHCDA has been able to award more CHDO projects through this effort. Per the HUD memo on statutory suspensions and regulatory waivers, during PY2020 IHCDA increased the amount of CHDO operating funding from 5% to 10%. IHCDA maintained the same level of operating support during PY2021. IHCDA responded to the HUD-ARP grant with a proposal and plan to offer supportive services and housing for the most vulnerable populations - specifically those at greatest risk of homelessness or housing crises. The amendment that was created will create housing opportunities and services for all four of the qualifying populations. Most of the funding will be distributed during the next two program years. IHCDA also allocated HOME resources to seven applicants for the creation of 20 new homebuyer homes, serving a population that often misses out on such opportunities, lower income families that are interested in and qualified for the purchase of a home. Other specific underserved needs are met by the following activities: IHCDA was awarded $2 million through the U.S Department of Housing and Urban Development's Heathy Homes Production Grant Program. IHCDA will be targeting the funds to address seven primary interventions, including radon, moisture intrusion, electrical hazards, accessibility, structural issues, carbon monoxide and CAPER 31 OMB Control 2506-0117 (exp. 06/30/2018) pests/refuse. IHCDA will be prioritizing and mitigation with this new grant program; Fifty-six of the 92 Counties in Indiana are considered as \"Zone 1\" by the EPA, with the highest prevalence of indoor radon level. The remaining 36 counties are rated as Zone 2 by the EPA. The program will coordinate with the Weatherization network and will triage households who are deferred for Weatherization due a need to address one of the above interventions. IHCDA will also have an online application, available to all Hoosiers (both owner occupied and rental units) who are experiencing higher levels of radon. IHCDA has also continued its relationship with CSH to provide its 12th iteration of the Supportive Housing Institute. For ESG, six outreach programs were funded. In the regions in which these programs operate, a concerted and consistent effort is made to reach the most vulnerable and underserved persons experiencing homelessness. Also, IHCDA continues to work with the state-wide PATH projects for additional street outreach to reach those underserved and hardest to serve. For HOPWA, each of the # subrecipients provides Housing information to reach those who might not know about HOPWA funding. Actions taken to reduce lead-based paint hazards. 91.220(k); 91.320(j) Actions taken to reduce exposure to lead-based paint have been led by IHCDA and have taken the form of increasing capacity to identify and mitigate lead paint hazards and providing funding for abatement activities. IHCDA has used HOME funds for 8-hour RRP EPA lead training in collaboration with the Indiana Builders Association. Attendees successfully passed the course exam and hands-on training to become certified as a renovator by the U.S. EPA to supervise and perform renovation, repair, and painting activities in target housing and child-occupied facilities. IHCDA created a contractor reimbursement policy designed to increase the number of licensed lead abatement professionals throughout the state who can perform lead abatement activities and participate in its LHRD program and other lead abatement programs. IHCDA will reimburse eligible firms or organizations for eligible training costs related to lead abatement courses for which their employee(s) register, complete, pass (from an approved Indiana State Health Department (ISDH)-accredited training facility), and receive a license. To date, IHCDA has assisted three firms through this program to add to the pipeline of eligible licensed lead abatement professionals. IHCDA, in conjunction with the Indiana State Health Department, created the Lead Protection Program (LPP). The Lead Protection Program's mission is to collaborate and effectively administer state efforts of three lead programs operating simultaneously throughout the State of Indiana. Other members include CAPER 32 OMB Control No: 2506-0117 (exp. 06/30/2018) the Indiana Community Action Association and the Environmental Management Institute. The Members have continued to meet to discuss to how to best triage families who have children with higher Elevated Blood Lead Levels between the various lead-control programs throughout the State. IHCDA staff joined the Healthy Homes Alliance and Lead Advisory Council to discuss lead programs and offer guidance to these working groups seeking to make a positive impact on elimination of lead-based paint poisoning. IHCDA conducted two technical assistance webinars for CDBG award administrators. IHCDA also developed a webpage dedicated to providing information on three lead programs operating throughout the State of Indiana. IHCDA was awarded $2 million under HUD's Healthy Homes Production Grant, to provide radon testing and radon mitigation services, and other healthy homes interventions, include lead hazard control, mold, accessibility barriers, electrical and plumbing hazards, and pest and refuse control. IHCDA will be launching applications for enrollment in this program in October 2022. IHCDA continued the administration of the Lead Hazard Reduction Demonstration (LHRD) Grant throughout PY 2021. In total, IHCDA was able to assist 51 households throughout four municipalities. Actions taken to reduce the number of poverty-level families. 91.220(k); 91.320(j) OCRA has continued to move forward with the timely administration of Covid-19 Response Program Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 projects. All projects focused on job retention activities are required to report annually for two years for grants or in perpetuity for non-forgivable loans. CDBG-CV staff audits submitted reports for accuracy and compliance with all goals and objectives of the program. Research has found that communities with robust planning and community engagement processes were more resilient to both the Great Recession and in the early months following the COVID19 pandemic. For this reason, OCRA has committed to using any remaining or returned funds awarded through the CARES Act to support long-term economic recovery efforts through its Hoosier Enduring Legacy Program (HELP). The program melds the pillars of OCRA's Stellar initiative to capitalize on the successes of previous efforts, while addressing the current environment of Hoosier communities. This new program supports communities directly through the development a strategic investment plan (SIP) and by providing access to set-aside CDBG-CV funding. The HELP process and the implementation of the resultant SIP will address poverty through the development of eligible projects in the designated communities. Through HELP, OCRA and its partners will employ community engagement, prior planning efforts, and asset building strategies to reengage communities in preparing for the future while building local leadership capacity. The program will amplify the impact of the Coronavirus Local Fiscal Recovery Funds, or CLFRF, of which $1.28 billion has been allocated directly to Indiana communities through the CAPER 33 OMB Control No: 2506-0117 (exp. 06/30/2018) American Rescue Plan Act, or ARPA. Communities will be expected to provide the following financial commitments: $20k match for Community Coordinator position in first year followed by $40k in subsequent years for fulltime hiring 30% of their CLFRF-ARP allocation to projects in the SIP OCRA will match community investment 1-1 for the implementation of SIP projects (up to $1 million). On Nov. 11, 2021, OCRA announced nine communities to be included in OCRA's Hoosier Enduring Legacy Program (HELP). The first cohort began the year-long program in January 2022. The second cohort began in the summer of 2022. The third cohort will kick off the program near the start of 2023. Four universities will assist communities in developing projects related to the four pathways. Purdue Center for Regional Development will work on Advancing e-Connectivity, Indiana Center for Rural Engagement on Promoting Community Wellness, Ball State Indiana Communities Institute on Enhancing Quality of Place, and Ivy Tech Community College on Strengthening Local Economies. With them, there will be ten weeks of Pathway Committee Meetings. In addition to 4 higher education organizations, designated communities will also work with the Indiana Arts Commission, the Indiana Department of Transportation, the Indiana Department of Health, the Indiana Housing and Community Development Authority, Columbus-based CivicLab and NEXT Studios. With CivicLab, communities will go through an intense data-training process to better understand the needs and trends of their communities. This process includes two elements: CivicLab will present an online, level-setting training that uses an equity lens to explore: 1) the neighborhood places where people live, work, learn, and play; and 2) the community systems that contribute to the quality of these places including social services, health care, justice, education, foundations, employers, faith-based organizations, local government, and economic and community development. Communities will also receive research and practices about the factors that predict the differences in upward economic mobility within communities. Each community in the cohort will receive custom data maps presented at the census block group level for the categories of enhancing quality of place, promoting community wellness, advancing e-connectivity, and strengthening local economies. The CivicLab team will demonstrate how to use the tools and then facilitate a team discussion about the contrasts, differences, and patterns seen across the maps. Ultimately, the data maps help a community see hidden inequities and think about how a placed-based approach might be different than the way their community is currently serving people and organizing their work. CAPER 34 OMB Control No: 2506-0117 (exp. 06/30/2018) ESG funds shifted to emphasize housing stability through tenant based rental programs. IHCDA continues to include several scoring preferences to more directly target funds to benefit poverty- level families: IHCDA has added an Opportunity Index to incentive the construction of HOME projects in areas with public transit, low unemployment, high job growth, low poverty rate, and higher household income. IHCDA utilized a scoring category on Health and Quality of Life Factors to incentive HOME developments near primary care physicians, fresh produce, and proximity to positive land uses. As part of the HUD-allowed COVID waivers, IHCDA waived match requirements for HOME projects through FY2021. The match requirement has been reinstated for 2022. The state also continued to utilize the Section 3 requirement which applies to employment opportunities generated (jobs created) as a result of projects receiving CDBG or HOME funding through ORCA or IHCDA--whether those opportunities are generated by the award recipient, a subrecipient, and/or a contractor. The requirements of Section 3 apply to all projects or activities associated with CDBG or HOME funding, regardless of whether the Section 3 project is fully or partially funded with CDBG/HOME. A detailed description of Section 3 requirements is included in OCRA/IHCDA's award manual. A notice of Section 3 requirements is included in bid solicitations and is covered during the award trainings. Actions taken to develop institutional structure. 91.220(k); 91.320(j) IHCDA has continued to bolster training and technical assistance of potential and current subrecipients through its support of and participation in the Indiana Permanent Supportive Housing Institute through its longstanding partnership with CSH. Teams receive over 80 hours of training, including individualized technical assistance and resources to assist in completing their projects. Industry experts provided insight on supportive services, property management, financing, and building design. ESG subrecipients continued to be required to create MOUs with all shelter providers, housing agencies, supportive service, and health care providers, and to provide a coordinated access point for housing and service delivery. Actions taken to enhance coordination between public and private housing and social service agencies. 91.220(k); 91.320(j) During PY21, OCRA shifted its outreach to public and private partners to a hybrid format. As COVID-19 vaccines became more widely available and the CDC's guidance for in person interactions was updated, OCRA staff began to strategically meet with communities both virtually and in person (again These regional workshops and interactions are a vital part of OCRA's ability to enhance coordination with key stakeholder groups and to provide technical assistance on CDBG funded programs. All workshops are organized to bring optimal learning opportunities to Main Street staff and volunteers. These events are delivered throughout the state and often include travel-friendly options like tele-video conferencing and CAPER 35 OMB Control No: 2506-0117 (exp. 06/30/2018) regionally based events. They will continue virtually and in person throughout this program year and in future program years. Main Street Community Exchanges are designed to bring Main Street communities from across the state to various locations to learn about best practices, new initiatives, and gain insight into other communities' unique approach to implementing Main Street. The exchanges feature learning opportunities, lunches, networking, and tours. The format for IMS Community Exchanges was revised in PY2021 to continue engaging Main Street communities on topics relate to the four-point approach and will resume onsite in PY2022. Additionally, in PY2021, OCRA resumed onsite Transformation Strategies meetings with Main Street communities and National Main Street. Every community and commercial district is different, with its own distinctive assets and sense of place. The Main Street Approach offers community-based revitalization initiatives with a practical, adaptable framework for downtown transformation that is easily tailored to local conditions. OCRA's IMS Facebook Group was created for Main Street Communities in PY2020 to share success stories, shared challenges, recent innovations and new local initiatives. Partner profiles highlighting statewide resources and opportunities for Main Street organizations are also featured. In PY2021, OCRA increased the Indiana Main Street program Facebook page members by 17.89% . OCRA provides communities access the Indiana Main Street Newsletter, a quarterly E-Newsletter with stories, updates, and applicable resources. In PY2021, OCRA also created a new Technical Assistance Interest Form for Main Street communities to assist with meeting technical assistance needs more effectively. The Great Lakes Main Street Conference was launched by OCRA in PY2019. The conference was created as a way to convene leaders in downtown and historic commercial district revitalization from all over the Great Lakes region. Through the conference, OCRA aims to highlight asset-based strategies for community and economic development. In PY2021, the GLMSC was held virtually and included over ten breakout sessions, three plenary sessions and networking events throughout the conference. Downtown Development Week will not be reinstated in PY2022. OCRA will instead focus on supporting \"Shop Small Indiana\" events. IMS communities will receive information and resources for their participating small businesses. OCRA is working on an annual recognition letter to go to all accredited IMS organizations detailing services provided to their respective communities in PY2022. IHCDA's programs have focused on building organizational structure and capacity. Part of this effort comes in the form of funding, technical assistance, and training provided to CHDOs as part of various HOME program projects and developments. In addition to this, a growing number of social service agencies have received similar benefits through programs offering rental assistance and supportive services to various populations. IHCDA has also established a strong relationship with the Family and Social Services Administration (FSSA) to coordinate the creation of affordable assisted living rental housing and integrated housing for persons with intellectual or developmental disabilities, as well as housing production and rental assistance programs for persons who have a chemical addiction. CAPER 36 OMB Control No: 2506-0117 (exp. 06/30/2018) IHCDA keeps lines of communication open with the Indiana chapter of NAHRO, the association of PHAs across the state. Additionally, in our role as the Balance of State CoC Collaborative Applicant, we have MOUs in place with several PHAs in order to connect individuals experiencing homelessness with the resources they need. Identify actions taken to overcome the effects of any impediments identified in the jurisdictions analysis of impediments to fair housing choice. 91.520(a) OCRA activities. In FY2021, OCRA postponed efforts to explore the creation of a program to support the opening of two additional fair housing centers in Indiana due to capacity constraints. OCRA wants new fair housing centers to be established with enough resources and funding to be sustainable long-term and needs additional time to evaluate. IN PY 2021, OCRA continued funding for fair housing education and outreach. OCRA's support of the Fair Housing Center of Central Indiana (FHCCI) resulted in 23 virtual fair housing trainings which had 622 registrants and 388 verified participants. The trainings had an overall average evaluation score of 4.88 out of 5.0 and were a means to provide additional education opportunities not otherwise able to provide by the FHCCI due to cost or service area priorities. The FHCCI is the only fair housing nonprofit advocacy organization in all of Indiana. OCRA's support helps leverage FHCCI's fair housing outreach and education initiative grants from HUD. These trainings also assist OCRA in showing its commitment to affirmatively furthering fair housing. The trainings were promoted through flyers, social media, the FHCCI website and e-newsletter, and by other means of outreach. The trainings were offered to attendees free of charge so that income limitations did not impact an attendee's ability to participate. Interested persons were required to pre-register through the FHCCI's events page. FHCCI staff were the primary speaker(s) at each training. Each Fair Housing Rental Basics Training was 120 minutes in length and focused on the following topic areas: Overview of fair housing laws (rental focus), Major fair housing regulations and guidance, Advertising requirements, and Overview of disability specific regulations. Each Fair Housing Disability Training was 120 minutes in length and focused on the following topic areas: Overview of fair housing laws; Disability specific fair housing regulations including reasonable accommodations, reasonable modifications, and design and construction accessibility requirements; and Common questions related to animals as reasonable accommodation. Each Fair Housing 90 Training was 90 minutes in length and was used to be a more in-depth training focusing on a particular fair housing topic that built on the Fair Housing Basics Training. Agendas varied due to the topics discussed. CAPER 37 OMB Control No: 2506-0117 (exp. 06/30/2018) IHCDA activities. IHCDA partnered with E & A Team to conduct a virtual fair housing training on Tuesday, July 13, 2021. This training provided an in-depth review of fair housing laws and compliance that included, among others, the following topics: Fair Housing laws, cases, and how to avoid discrimination Reasonable accommodations and reasonable modifications, including HUD's new assistance animal guidelines and how to handle hoarding and recreational drugs Harassment: how to handle harassment and what language should be included in a harassment policy Language barriers: how to work with tenants who do not speak English IHCDA also provided materials and technical assistance to its tax credit development partners on the subject of eviction prevention and low-barrier screening techniques, as these two topics constitute barriers to housing for many lower income households. In addition to working with property managers, owners, and developers, IHCDA required all members of its own staff to complete a five module training during the first part of 2022 (due May 9, 2022). The information was broken down as follows: Module #1 - What is Fair Housing? Module #2 - Protected Classes and Prohibited Actions Module #3 - Access for Persons with Disabilities Module #4 - Beyond Fair Housing Module #5 - You Can Further Fair Housing! CAPER 38 Monitoring 91.220 and 91.230 Describe the standards and procedures used to monitor activities carried out in furtherance of the plan and used to ensure long-term compliance with requirements of the programs involved, including minority business outreach and the comprehensive planning requirements CDBG Monitoring . OCRA conducts a monitoring of every grant project receiving HUD funds. Two basic types of monitoring are used: off-site or \"desk\" monitoring and on-site monitoring. Desk monitoring is conducted by staff for non-construction projects. On-site monitoring is a structured review conducted by OCRA staff at the locations where project activities are being carried out or project records are being maintained. During the pandemic, OCRA chose to conduct all monitoring off site in order to ensure the safety of staff and recipients. Based on an evaluation of this practice utilizing county-level data on COVID outbreaks, OCRA determined to reinstate on-site monitoring in spring of PY21. OCRA evaluates recipients' and subrecipients' employment practices in order to determine whether or not EEOC guidelines are followed in advertising vacancies. The state's field monitors review recipients' civil rights files to determine if there have been any EEO complaints filed against a recipient within five years. The field monitors also review records of complaints and responses regarding alleged discrimination in the provision of program benefits. CARES Act Monitoring. OCRA conducts monitoring for all grants funded through the CARES Act. This includes, projects, public services, and job retention activities funded through OCRA's COVID-19 Response Program (all phases) and Community Connections for People with Disabilities (CCPWD). In accordance with its established procedures, OCRA will utilize two basic types of monitoring: off-site or \"desk\" monitoring and on-site monitoring. Desk monitoring is conducted by staff for non-construction projects. On-site monitoring is a structured review conducted by OCRA staff at the locations where project activities are being carried out or project records are being maintained. In addition, for Job Retention Activities funded through the CARES ACT, documentation is sent in via email and is evaluated for accuracy and completion by CDBG program staff. The documentation includes the CDBG CV Economic Verification Form or the FTE calculation form and the Business Statements of Need. For reporting, OCRA requires recipients to submit year 1 and year 2 for grants. For loans, they are required to report every year until all the funds are revolved. IHCDA Monitoring . IHCDA conducts at least one monitoring of every grant project receiving CDBG and HOME funds. The recipient must ensure that all records relating to the award are available at IHCDA's monitoring. For those projects determined to need special attention, IHCDA may conduct one or more monitoring visits while award activities are in full progress. Two basic types of monitoring are used: on- site monitoring and desk-top monitoring. IHCDA runs the project list every year, which includes the CAPER 39 OMB Control No: 2506-0117 (exp. 06/30/2018) sample size for each project. IHCDA's Inspector will randomly choose the units; the property owner/management does not get advance notice of which units will be inspected. See CR-50 for additional information on HOME Compliance Monitoring. ESG uses a combination of reports from HMIS and onsite visits. Annually, subrecipients outcomes are evaluated. Outcomes include: ESG rental assistance program sub-recipients-- at discharge from program, 70% of persons assisted will still be permanently housing. Sixty percent of persons will increase or maintain their income. Emergency shelter operations, essential services and financial assistance: 56% of persons will discharge to permanent housing, 55% of persons' income will increase or maintain their income. Transitional Housing preparations, essential services and financial assistance--75% will discharge to permanent housing, 60% will increase or maintain their income. Outreach--50% of identified caseload will exit to a positive housing solution and 40% of identified caseload will increase their income. HOPWA. Consistent with HUD requirements, 50% of IHCDA's HOPWA programs are monitored annually. If there are any findings or concerns from the monitoring, the subrecipient has 30 days from monitoring date to respond with corrections or action plans. Citizen Participation Plan 91.105(d); 91.115(d) Describe the efforts to provide citizens with reasonable notice and an opportunity to comment on performance reports . Public notices about the comment period of the Draft CAPER were posted September 15, 2022 on agency websites and circulated through e-newsletters. A copy of the notice announcing the availability of the CAPER for public review is appended to this section. The notice contained both English and Spanish. The CAPER was available for public inspection and members of the public, including low and moderate income persons, were encouraged to review the CAPER online at www.in.gov/ocra from September 15 through September 28, 2022. Residents were able to mail, email or verbally (via a toll-free number) communicate comments on the CAPER. No comments were received from the public on the Draft 2021 CAPER during the public comment period. CAPER 40 No: 2506-0117 (exp. 06/30/2018) CR-45 - CDBG 91.520(c) Specify the nature of, and reasons for, any changes in the jurisdiction's program objectives and indications of how the jurisdiction would change its programs as a result of its experiences. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in PY 2021 OCRA continued the suspension of some of its regular programs to focus on the distribution of funding available for COVID-19 response. This included: In PY2021, the Main Street Revitalization Program (MSRP) was suspended to re-evaluate needs and potential improvements post-pandemic. OOR Program (IHCDA): Discontinued; OCRA opened the first round of its OOR pilot in PY2021 to determine the feasibility of an OCRA administered OOR program. Four (4) competitive OOR awards were announced in November 2021 for a total of $939,000. These 4 communities and one (1) additional Stellar community, who received $250,000 to extend their existing OOR program, are currently in implementation. OCRA believes that the effective management and administration of the OOR program is a significant effort at both the state and local level. As the needs of our rural communities continue to grow, the advantages of housing made available through the rehabilitation of existing homes seem evident based on public comment received. However, OCRA is also aware that numerous challenges exist which can impede the successful administration of this activity in accordance with all applicable federal requirements. Smaller rural communities with limited administrative capacity must often rely on regional partnerships, and/or other non-profits that act as sub-recipients for the OOR program because of the expense and complexity of the monitoring and oversight requirements. Challenges related to these requirements have become increasingly prevalent since the COVID-19 public health crisis and the resultant economic recession. While the Office of Community and Rural Affairs (OCRA) recognizes the role of the OOR program in meeting the state's affordable housing needs and agrees with public comment received in PY21 on the potential for greater use of the OOR program in rural communities to benefit aging and disabled residents, at this time, the agency needs time to fully address these issues within the program's design. A second pilot round is planned to open in Sept. of 2022. Stellar Regions Program: Suspended due to COVID-19. In PY2021, Stellar funds were re-allocated for COVID-19 response or to other related programming. For future years, OCRA will continue to work with our State program partners on enhancements and updates. This decision reflects OCRA's commitment to maintain flexibility in response to the impact of the pandemic on rural communities. Public Facilities Program (PFP): Reinstated in PY2021 based on public comments received. CAPER 41 OMB Control No: 2506-0117 (exp. 06/30/2018) The state has not utilized the Section 108 program and, as such, there are no outstanding Section 108 loans. OCRA continued to use FY 2019 Scoring Criteria for FY 2021 grant rounds due to impacts related to the Covid-19 pandemic. Based on additional research and community feedback, OCRA was able to open Phase 2 and 3 to municipalities of all sizes. Other protocols in place for Phase 2 and Phase 3 were: Phase 2 Eligible applicants for Phase 2 of the COVID-19 Response Program included non- entitlement local units of government. Phase 2 was a competitive process with more information requested up-front to reduce after award administration. The two eligible economic recovery activities included grants or loans to businesses to retain low-to-moderate (LMI) jobs. Phase 3 Eligible applicants for Phase 3 of the COVID-19 Response Program included non- entitlement local units of government. Phase 3 was a competitive process with more information requested up-front to reduce after award administration. Eligible activities were: mental health services, childcare services, public WiFi locations, food pantry or bank services, or grants or loans to businesses to retain low-to-moderate (LMI) jobs. Activities were expanded to broaden the impact of the funds for communities with ongoing needs related to COVID-19. OCRA will continue to evaluate the pandemic's impact and priorities of rural communities to determine the feasibility of reinstating suspended programs. Does this Jurisdiction have any open Brownfields Economic Development Initiative (BEDI) grants? No. [BEDI grantees] Describe accomplishments and program outcomes during the last year. N/A CAPER 42 OMB Control No: 2506-0117 (exp. HOME 91.520(d) Include the results of on-site inspections of affordable rental housing assisted under the program to determine compliance with housing codes and other applicable regulations. Please list those projects that should have been inspected on-site this program year based upon the schedule in \u00a792.504(d). Indicate which of these were inspected and a summary of issues that were detected during the inspection. For those that were not inspected, please indicate the reason and how you will remedy the situation. IHCDA runs the project list every year, which includes the sample size for each project. IHCDA's Inspector will randomly choose the units; the property owner/management does not get advance notice of which units will be inspected. During PY21, 193 properties and 825 HOME-funded units were inspected. Of those inspections, 390 failed the inspection due to condition issues; these represented 47% of all units. The most common issues included missing water heater pipes or leaking water heaters; exposed electrical and loose outlets; defective fire alarms and smoke alarms; broken or missing windows; loose light fixtures; inoperable or broken windows; and inoperable garbage disposals. The detailed results of the inspections are appended to this CAPER. A 30 day correction period is required and documentation of those corrections is required to be submitted within 90 days of the reports being sent out. If correction are not completed, IHCDA may suspend the project sponsor and prohibit future funding. Provide an assessment of the jurisdiction's affirmative marketing actions for HOME units. 92.351(b) IHCDA reviews the Affirmative Marketing plans to ensure compliance as applications are submitted and reviewed. IHCDA also reviews the Fair Housing Market Plans during closeout of awards. IHCDA had no findings in FY2020. According to the HOME Performance Report (PR23), one-third of HOME units completed were occupied by minority households, which exceeds the overall proportion in the state. Recipients of our funding were encouraged to attend the Fair Housing training t hosted by IHCDA and the Fair Housing Center of Central Indiana. Recipients, property managers, maintenance staff, and the general public were invited to attend this training which covered fair housing laws, what to do to avoid fair housing discrimination, and how to develop a marketing plan that ensures fair housing policies have been met. All HOME and CDBG award recipients with rental or homebuyer projects containing five or more associated units must certify compliance with IHCDA affirmative marketing procedures per the award agreement. Additionally, the recipient must create an Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plan by using the HUD form 935.2A. The plan must be updated at least once every five years or more frequently when CAPER 43 OMB Control No: 2506-0117 (exp. 06/30/2018) there are significant changes in the demographics of the local housing market area as described in the instructions for Part 9 on form. The recipient must identify the population(s) least likely to apply for housing and the outreach/marketing efforts that will be utilized to reach that population. All CDBG and HOME award recipients are required to post the Fair Housing Opportunity poster at public buildings as evidence of the award recipient's fair housing policy. Also, if a subrecipient is associated with an IHCDA award, the subrecipient must also post the poster in its offices. Finally, if the project involves a public facility or a building with a common area, such as a leasing office, the fair housing poster must be hung conspicuously at those locations as well. Copies of this poster may be obtained from your IHCDA Real Estate Production Analyst or Compliance Auditor. Award recipients must also include the Fair Housing logo on all client correspondence (confirmation letters, brochures, leases, etc.) This logo is available at the following HUD website: http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/library/bookshelf11/hudgraphics/fheologo Award recipients must provide all beneficiaries the HUD brochure entitled \"You May Be A Victim Of...\" Documentation of the client's receipt of the brochure must be maintained in the client's file. Therefore, the award recipient is responsible for creating a receipt form for the beneficiary to sign as receipt of the Fair Housing brochure. Refer to IDIS reports to describe the amount and use of program income for projects, including the number of projects and owner and tenant characteristics During PY20, $4,210,887.61 in HOME program income was received. Draws constituted: PY18\u2014$none from PY20\u2014$280,072.67 for TBRA As allowed under the HOME program, PI is no longer receipted as it is received. It is held in the PI account and is used for rental projects and TBRA. Tenant characteristics are not tracked; however, tenant characteristics can be determined for those owners who specialize in certain populations. Most of PI invested was used for very low-income elderly and families and persons vulnerable to or experiencing homelessness. Owner and, where available, tenant characteristics include: 1) Family Promise of Hendricks County\u2014a nonprofit experiencing homelessness - funded 16 units of TBRA. 2) Access Group Wellness Project Corporation - nonprofit serving low-income families, 12 rental units 3) Habitat For Humanity Morgan County\u2014 nonprofit serving low income families, 1 homebuyer unit CAPER 44 OMB Control No: 2506-0117 (exp. 06/30/2018) 4) Habitat for Humanity Elkhart County\u2014nonprofit low income families, 1 homebuyer unit 5) LaCasa Inc,--nonprofit service low income families, 14 rental units 6) Thrive Alliance\u2014 a nonprofit serving seniors and persons with disabilities, 12 rental units Describe other actions taken to foster and maintain affordable housing. 91.220(k) IHCDA is the public housing authority for the state. As such, we administer the Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers for the balance of state, that is, for any area not covered by another local PHA. However, IHCDA does not own or manage any properties. Through special funding opportunities, IHCDA is implementing voucher programs in addition to HCV. These include Family unification program vouchers which serve families at risk of being separated or for youth aging out of foster care. Also included are Mainstream vouchers which serve households with non-elderly disabled individuals. Another program is VASH which serves veterans experiencing homelessness. In addition to these are TBRA and Section 811 vouchers allow IHCDA to assist additional families/households with payment of monthly rent obligations along with security and utility deposits. (STATES ONLY: Including the coordination of LIHTC with the development of affordable housing). 91.320(j) In an effort to streamline the multifamily application process, IHCDA allows developers applying for Rental Housing Tax Credits (RHTCs) or Multifamily Private Activity Tax-Exempt Bonds (Bonds) to simultaneously request funds from the HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME). If a developer applies for RHTCs or Bonds for any development and wants to also access HOME funds, the developer completes the HOME Section of the \"Multi-Family Housing Finance Application\" and submit all necessary HOME attachments. HOME attachments (i.e., Historic Review, Environmental Review, Davis Bacon, Match, URA) must be submitted on or before the application deadline. Outside of this process, applications for HOME financing for a RHTC or Bond development will only be considered in accordance with IHCDA's HOME application criteria. HOME funds cannot be committed to a development until all necessary financing has been secured. In the event that an application is competitive for RHTCs or Bonds but either (1) the application fails the HOME threshold review; or (2) HOME funds are not available to award, IHCDA will allow the applicant to submit additional information to identify other ways to fill the development's financing gap. Upon timely receipt of requested information, these applications will continue to be allowed to compete for an allocation of RHTCs or Bonds. If the potential development has an open HOME, Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), or Development Fund award, the applicant may request funding through the QAP; however, applicants must request approval at least 30 days prior to the application deadline and IHCDA must approve this action. Requests will be reviewed and underwritten on a case-by-case basis.

Project Outcomes Data measured under the performance standards developed in consultation with the CoC(s) The Balance of State C of C has established the following performance standards for ESG grantees. ESG program sub-recipients that are emergency shelters are funded for operations, essential services and financial assistance: 50% of persons will discharge to permanent housing, 25% will increase their income. ESG program sub-recipients that are Transitional Housing programs that have activities: operations, essential services and financial assistance: 69% will discharge to permanent housing, 50% will increase their income. ESG rental assistance program sub-recipients: At discharge from program, 82% persons assisted will still be permanently housed. 65% of persons will increase their income. ESG program sub-recipients that have outreach component: 50% of identified caseload will be permanently housed; 50% identified caseload will increase their income. Based on the Sage report for all subrecipients of ESG in PY2021, 46% of residents exiting the program had positive housing destinations\u2014slightly less than the performance standard. This measures positive movement out of the homeless system and is divided into three tables: movement off the streets from Street Outreach (Metric 7a.1); movement into permanent housing situations from ES, SH, TH, and RRH (Metric 7b.1); and retention or exits to permanent housing situations from PH (other than PH-RRH). Out of the 47% of residents exiting the program the following were permanent destinations: Owned by client, no ongoing housing subsidy 125 4% Owned by client, with ongoing housing subsidy 25 1% Rental by client, no ongoing housing subsidy 1003 32% Rental by client, with VASH housing subsidy 38 1% Rental by client, with GPD TIP housing subsidy 1 0% Rental by client, with other ongoing housing subsidy 246 8% Permanent housing (other than RRH) for formerly homeless persons 144 5% Staying or living with family, permanent tenure 653 21% Staying or living with friends, permanent tenure 151 5% Rental by client, with RRH or equivalent subsidy 433 14% Rental by client, with HCV voucher (tenant or project based) 145 5% CAPER 53 OMB Control No: 2506-0117 (exp. 06/30/2018) Rental by client in a public housing unit 133 4% Households without positive housing destinations were most likely to living in temporary situations with family or friends or had unknown outcomes. For HOPWA, all of the program year goals were met. These performance standards and outcomes have been monitored by the Indiana Balance of State Continuum of Care and the IHCDA Community Services grants staff. In Calendar Year (CY) 2021, the IN BoS CoC Board has initiated a strategic planning process that will update its strategic objectives. This process should be concluded by the end of CY2022. The IN BoS CoC performance and outcomes committee will then use that information to update performance standards. In addition, the IHCDA Community Services grants staff is working to create a grants management system in order to monitor subrecipient performance more efficiently and more effectively.

HOPWA Page 1 form HUD-40110-D (Expiration Date: 11/30/2023) OMB Approval No. 2506-0133 Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS (HOPWA) Program Consolidated Annual Performance and Evaluation Report (CAPER) Measuring Performance Outcomes OMB Number 2506-0133 (Expiration Date: 11/30/2023) The CAPER report for HOPWA formula grantees provides annual information on program accomplishments that supports program evaluation and the ability to measure program beneficiary outcomes as related to: maintain housing stability; prevent homelessness; and improve access to care and support. This information is also covered under the Consolidated Plan Management Process (CPMP) report and includes Narrative Responses and Performance Charts required under the Consolidated Planning regulations. Reporting is required for all HOPWA formula grantees. The public reporting burden for the collection of information is estimated to average 41 hours per manual response, or less if an automated data collection and retrieval system is in use, along with 60 hours for record keeping, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. HUD's requirements for reports submitted by HOPWA formula grantees are supported by 42 U.S.C. at 24 CFR \u00a7 574.520(a). Grantees are required to report on the activities undertaken only, thus there may be components of these reporting requirements that may not be applicable. This agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to a collection of information unless that collection displays a valid OMB control number. While confidentiality is not assured, HUD generally only releases this information as required or permitted by law. ______________________________________________________________________________ Previous editions are obsolete Page ii form HUD-40110-D (Expiration Date: 11/30/2023) OMB Approval No. 2506-0133 Overview. The Consolidated Annual Performance and Evaluation Report (CAPER) provides annual performance reporting on client outputs and outcomes that enables an assessment of grantee performance in achieving the housing stability outcome measure. The CAPER fulfills statutory and regulatory program reporting requirements and provides the grantee and HUD with the necessary information to assess the overall program performance and accomplishments against planned goals and objectives. HOPWA formula grantees are required to submit a CAPER demonstrating coordination with other Consolidated Plan resources. HUD uses the CAPER data to obtain essential information on grant activities, project sponsors,, housing sites, units and households, and beneficiaries (which includes racial and ethnic data on program participants). The Consolidated Plan Management Process tool (CPMP) provides an optional tool to integrate the reporting of HOPWA specific activities with other planning and reporting on Consolidated Plan activities.

Information on Individuals, Beneficiaries and Households Receiving HOPWA Housing Subsidy Assistance (TBRA, STRMU, PHP, Facility Based Units, Master Leased Units ONLY) B. Facility-Based Housing Assistance Continued Use Periods . Grantees that used HOPWA funding for new construction, acquisition, or substantial rehabilitation of a building or structure are required to operate the building or structure for HOPWA- eligible beneficiaries for a ten (10) years period. If no further HOPWA funds are used to support the facility, in place of completing Section 7B of the CAPER, the grantee must submit an Annual Report of Continued Project Operation throughout the required use periods. This report is included in Part 6 in CAPER. The required use period is three (3) years if the rehabilitation is non-substantial. Record Keeping. Names and other individual information must be kept confidential, as required by 24 CFR 574.440. However, HUD reserves the right to review the information used to complete this report for grants management oversight purposes, except for recording any names and other identifying information. In the case that HUD must review client-level data, no client names or identifying information will be retained or recorded. Information is reported in aggregate to HUD without personal identification. Do not submit client or personal information in data systems to HUD. In connection with the development of the Department's standards for Homeless Management Information Systems (HMIS), universal data elements are being collected for clients of HOPWA-funded homeless assistance projects. These project sponsor records would include: Name, Social Security Number, Date of Birth, Ethnicity and Race, Gender, Veteran Status, Disabling Conditions, Residence Prior to Program Entry, Zip Code of Last Permanent Address, Housing Status, Program Entry Date, Program Exit Date, Personal Identification Number, and Household Identification Number. These are intended to match the elements under HMIS. The HOPWA program-level data elements include: Income and Sources, Non-Cash Benefits, HIV/AIDS Status, Services Provided, Housing Status or Destination at the end of the operating year, Physical Disability, Developmental Disability, Chronic Health Condition, Mental Health, Substance Abuse, Domestic Violence, Medical Assistance, and T- cell Count. Other HOPWA projects sponsors may also benefit from collecting these data elements. HMIS local data systems must maintain client confidentiality by using a closed system in which medical information and HIV status are only shared with providers that have a direct involvement in the client's case management, treatment and care, in line with the signed release of information from the client. Operating Year. HOPWA formula grants are annually awarded for a three-year period of performance with three operating years. The information contained in this CAPER must represent a one-year period of HOPWA program operation that coincides with the grantee's program year; this is the operating year. More than one HOPWA formula grant awarded to the same grantee may be used during an operating year and the CAPER must capture all formula grant funding used during the operating year. Project sponsor accomplishment information must also coincide with the operating year this CAPER covers. Any change to the period of performance requires the approval of HUD by amendment, such as an extension for an additional operating year. Final Assembly of Report. After the entire report is assembled, number each page sequentially. Filing Requirements . Within 90 days of the completion of each program year, grantees must submit their completed CAPER to the CPD Director in the grantee's State or Local HUD Field Office, and to the HOPWA Program Office: at HOPWA@hud.gov . Electronic submission to HOPWA Program office is preferred; however, if electronic submission is not possible, hard copies can be mailed to: Office of HIV/AIDS Housing, Room 7248, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, D.C., 20410. Definitions Adjustment for Duplication: Enables the calculation of unduplicated output totals by accounting for the total number of households or units that received more than one type of HOPWA assistance in a given service category such as HOPWA Subsidy Assistance or Supportive Services. For example, if a client household received both TBRA and STRMU during the operating year, report that household in the category of HOPWA Housing Subsidy Assistance in Part 3, Chart 1, Column [1b] in the following manner: HOPWA Housing Subsidy Assistance [1] Outputs: Number of Households 1. Tenant-Based Rental Assistance 82 2a. Permanent Housing Facilities: Received Operating Subsidies/Leased units 0 2b. Transitional/Short-term Facilities: Received Operating Subsidies 0 3a. Permanent Housing Facilities: Capital Development Projects placed in service during the operating year 0 3b. Transitional/Short-term Facilities: Capital Development Projects placed in service during the operating year 0 4. Short-term Rent, Mortgage, and Utility Assistance 121 5. Adjustment for duplication (subtract) 27 6. TOTAL Housing Subsidy Assistance (Sum of Rows 1 -4 minus Row 5) 97 ______________________________________________________________________________ Previous editions are obsolete Page iii form HUD-40110-D (Expiration Date: 11/30/2023) OMB Approval No. 2506-0133 Administrative Costs: Costs for general management, oversight, coordination, evaluation, and reporting.

Project sponsor administrative costs are limited to 7% of the portion of the grant amount they receive. Beneficiary(ies): All members of a household who received HOPWA assistance during the operating year including the one individual who qualified the household for HOPWA assistance as well as any other members of the household (with or without HIV) who benefitted from the assistance. Chronically Homeless Person: An individual or family who : (i) is homeless and lives or resides individual or family who: (i) Is homeless and lives or resides in a place not meant for human habitation, a safe haven, or in an emergency shelter; (ii) has been homeless and living or residing in a place not meant for human habitation, a safe haven, or in an emergency shelter continuously for at least 1 year or on at least 4 separate occasions in the last 3 years; and (iii) has an adult head of household (or a minor head of household if no adult is present in the household) with a diagnosable substance use disorder, serious mental illness, developmental disability (as defined in section 102 of the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 2000 (42 U.S.C. 15002)), post traumatic stress disorder, cognitive impairments resulting from a brain injury, or chronic physical illness or disability, including the co-occurrence of 2 or more of those conditions. Additionally, the statutory definition includes as chronically homeless a person who currently lives or resides in an institutional care facility, including a jail, substance abuse or mental health treatment facility, hospital or other similar facility, and has resided there for fewer than 90 days if such person met the other criteria for homeless prior to entering that facility. (See 42 U.S.C. 11360(2)) This does not include doubled-up or overcrowding situations. Disabling Condition: Evidencing a diagnosable substance use disorder, serious mental illness, developmental disability, chronic physical illness, or disability, including the co-occurrence of two or more of these conditions. In addition, a disabling condition may limit an individual's ability to work or perform one or more activities of daily living. An HIV/AIDS diagnosis is considered a disabling condition.

Faith-Based Organization: Religious organizations of three types: (1) congregations; (2) national networks, which include national denominations, their social service arms (for example, Catholic Charities, Lutheran Social Services), and networks of related organizations (such as YMCA and YWCA); and (3) freestanding religious organizations, which are incorporated separately from congregations and national networks. Grassroots Organization: An organization headquartered in the local community where it provides services; has a social services budget of $300,000 or less annually, and six or fewer full-time equivalent employees. Local affiliates of national organizations are not considered \"grassroots.\" HOPWA Eligible Individual: The one (1) low-income person with HIV/AIDS who qualifies a household for HOPWA assistance. This person may be considered \"Head of Household.\" When the CAPER asks for information on eligible individuals, report on this individual person only. Where there is more than one person with HIV/AIDS in the household, the additional PWH/A(s), would be considered a beneficiary(s). HOPWA Housing Information Services: Services dedicated to helping persons living with HIV/AIDS and their families to identify, locate, and acquire housing. This may also include fair housing counseling for eligible persons who may encounter discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, familial status, or handicap/disability. HOPWA Housing Subsidy Assistance Total: The unduplicated number of households receiving housing subsidies (TBRA, STRMU, Permanent Housing Placement services and Master Leasing) and/or residing in units of facilities dedicated to persons living with HIV/AIDS and their families and supported with HOPWA funds during the operating year. Household: A single individual or a family composed of two or more persons for which household incomes are used to determine eligibility and for calculation of the resident rent payment.

Housing Stability: The degree to which the HOPWA project assisted beneficiaries to remain in stable housing during the operating year. See Part 5: Determining Housing Stability Outcomes for definitions of stable and unstable housing situations. In-kind Leveraged Resources: These are additional types of support provided to assist HOPWA beneficiaries such as volunteer services, materials, use of equipment and building space. The actual value of the support can be the contribution of professional services, based on customary rates for this specialized support, or actual costs contributed from other leveraged resources. In determining a rate for the contribution of volunteer time and services, use the criteria described in 2 CFR 200. The value of any donated material, equipment, building, or lease should be based on the fair market value at time of donation.

Grantee Narrative and Performance Assessment a. Grantee and Community Overview Provide a one to three page narrative summarizing major achievements and highlights that were proposed and completed during the program year. Include a brief description of the grant organization, area of service, the name(s) of the program contact(s), and an overview of the range/type of housing activities provided. This overview may be used for public information, including posting on HUD's website. Note: Text fields are expandable. IHCDA subrecipients receiving HOPWA funding provided the following information on their major achievements and highlights this year: IU Health- Positive Link exists to work with our community to end the HIV epidemic in Indiana by providing prevention, care, and support services. Positive Link provides a full continuum of HIV services, including outreach education and testing, health screenings, care coordination, medical care, nutrition programming, transportation assistance, homeless prevention, housing programs and emergency financial assistance. Services are provided in a 49-county region of Indiana with 21 counties receiving HOPWA assistance (10 counties - HOPWA IHCDA [Monroe, Lawrence, Bartholomew, Greene, Owen, Clay, Sullivan, Vigo, Parke and Vermillion] and 11 counties - HOPWA City of Indianapolis [Brown, Morgan, Johnson, Shelby, Hancock, Marion, Hendricks, Putnam, Boone, Hamilton, Madison]). Positive Link strives to include and prioritize the rural counties to facilitate statewide access to HOPWA assistance and care. HOPWA program contacts include Jill Stowers, Clinical Director and Cindy Burdine, Housing Team Lead. Positive Link provides rental assistance and supportive services to at-risk, homeless, and low-income persons impacted by HIV and their families. Both short term HOPWA assistance, including rent, utilities and mortgage and long-term HOPWA assistance through Tenant Based Rental Assistance (TBRA) are provided. Limited HOPWA funding is available for first month and deposit assistance to assist households in securing permanent housing. Housing Case Management services are provided to all households either receiving direct financial assistance or are impacted by HIV and need housing resources. Positive Link served 89 households (119 individuals), 94% remained in either their own home, transitioned into permanent affordable housing or remained in HOPWA TBRA housing. All clients received case management services which included an assessment, quarterly review, and a comprehensive housing stability plan. The success of the program is linked to a client centered housing plan that is actively supported through support and referrals from the housing case manager. 100% of clients served with HOPWA funds developed a housing plan, established, and maintained contact with their housing case manager and medical or non-medical case manager. 98% were engaged in medical care, with 2% having care staff coordinating upcoming visits. A weekly primary care clinic opened on-site in our Bloomington office in 2017 to provide more comprehensive medical services to our clients in that region. Through engagement in medical case management, 100% of housing clients accessed medical insurance and medications. Gainful employment continues to be a challenge in the transition out of the pandemic even though 79% of the households have at least one source of income. Sufficient income for stable housing costs remains a struggle especially in the face of rising rents The other 21% of households without income are seeking employment or have applied for disability funding. Positive Link expanded services through the CV grant to assist households still struggling through Covid-19 impacts, including health, economics and housing stability. This was accompolished by providing emergency hotel assistance when no other resources were identified and by providing nutrition and tranportation support The Aliveness Project of NWI (APNWI) focuses on supporting persons living with HIV/AIDS by providing resources to sustain daily living. Within our office we have Non-Medical Case Managers, a Medical Case Manager, Risk Reduction Team, and Housing Case Manager/Coordinator. These separate depar tments work together to make sure the needs of ______________________________________________________________________________ Previous editions are obsolete Page 8 form HUD-40110-D (Expiration Date: 11/30/2023) OMB Approval No. 2506-0133 everyone who walks through our door are met effectively. APNWI provides care coordination, free HIV testing, education outreach, insurance acquisition, and housing support. Our main areas of service include Lake, LaPorte, and Porter County. Housing assistance is a major need of our consumers. The Housing Case Manager/Coordinator, Zhanae Howard, works under AP Housing Works, to coordinate and assist consumers with their housing needs. With our HOPWA program we can support a variety of financial needs: Tenant-Based Rental Assistance, Short Term Rental, Utility, and Mortgage Assistance, as well as Permanent Housing Placement. Because we understand that our assistance may not meet every consumer's needs, we do provide outside resources such as the Indiana Emergency Rental Assistance Program (IERA) or local Township Trustees to further assist. With our housing assistance our main goal is to reduce the risk of homelessness, maintain stable housing, and improve access to HIV care and treatment. Tenant-Based Rental Assistance serves majority of our consumers. These individuals may be living with a disability, fixed income that they cannot cover all daily living expenses or maintaining stable living for a family which include minor children. TBRA can provide financial assistance for an entirety of a lease. Those with income are responsible for up to 30% their annual gross income and a housing assistance payment will cover the rest. Short Term Rent, Mortgage, and Utility Assistance (STRMU) focuses on providing a short-term intervention to help maintain stable living environments for households experiencing financial crisis. Consumers are allotted a total of five (5) months within a 52-week period for assistance. Following the maximum amount of assistance received, the Housing Case Manager and consumer discuss if further assistance is needed or not, and other resources available. We understand that moving can be a major cost, Permanent Housing Placement (PHP) supports consumers who are looking to establish a new residence. PHP can assist with a variety of costs, which include rental application fees, security deposits, and first month's rent. During the time consumers are receiving assistance the Housing Case Manager periodically discusses their Housing Plan and Budgeting Worksheet. Their Housing Plan is a goal sheet created to discuss the objective of housing assistance and action steps to reach these goals. The Budgeting Worksheet provides a visual representation of the consumers income and monthly expenses. Due to lack of education of financial assistance, our Housing Case Manager/Coordinator also serves as a liaison between consumers and landlords, while making sure to maintain confidentiality. With the help of HOPWA, APNWI has been able to remove individuals from homelessness, obtain and maintain stable housing for families, and provide a safe living environment for many. The AIDS Resource Group (ARG) is a ASO providing case management, supplement HIV services, community outreach and education including HIV, HCV, and Syphilis testing. RW HIV services are provided to HIV+ individuals living in Indiana and income eligible (depending on each program service needed). Services are offered to Southwest Indiana Counties- Warrick, Vanderburgh, Perry, Pike, Gibson, Dubois, Martin, Knox, Spencer, Posey, Daviess. Program contacts are Stacey Easley-Executive Director, Adam Schaaf-Housing Specialist, and Erica Storch\u2014HIV Services Program Manager. ARG provides housing assistance HOPWA\u2014TBRA, STRMU, PHP, and Supportive Services. TBRA, STRMU, and PHP provide direct services to end or prevent homelessness. A major benefit to the PHP and STRMU programs is allowing clients undergoing transition (lose/reduction income, medical issues, changes in household, unexpected repairs) reduce the risk of losing housing. Supportive Services allows the agency to provide an extra resource to ensure clients are able to attend medical/mental health appointments, access food referrals, and pick up medications. While the transportation program is not designed to sustain, the supplement improves the clients' access to above listed services. Nutritional assistance allows the clients to access the food for their household and supplement their budget allocating funds toward housing and utilities. TBRA guidelines require the rent include utilities. Utilities are a great barrier to maintaining stable housing has been keeping utilities working. Many of the homeless clients are not able to get utilities in own name which is another barrier to stable housing. HS meets with each TBRA client monthly and at least quarterly in the home. During these meetings, the HS addresses living conditions to ensure the client is living in a safe, decent, and sanitary environment. If the listed factors are not met, HS addresses with client and Landlord. In order to maintain health and stability, the housing program requires the unit meet inspection guidelines which are required in the Housing Guidelines. Through housing casement and housing plan, the HS is able to review with needs vs wants, budgeting, and objectives for reaching housing goals. Clients are encouraged and instructed how to review finances when considering housing options. Budgets are reviewed monthly to ensure ______________________________________________________________________________ Previous editions are obsolete Page 9 form HUD-40110-D (Expiration Date: 11/30/2023) OMB Approval No. 2506-0133 clients are able to maintain housing and meet long term housing goals. HS explains to clients pro/cons of units with utilities included and explains/reviews lease agreements to ensure the client is aware of the commitment. Clients lacking understanding of lease agreements often times violate the agreement without knowing and face eviction. Housing case management strives to increase client awareness of leasing requirements. Challenges for the program continue to be limited access to affordable housing. As majority of our clients have a limited, fixed income or no income at all, housing options are reduced to a few providers. HS continues to search for options fitting programming guidelines along with offering options for those with lower income. Another challenge is locating affordable, guidelines fitting units for a parent needing more than 1 or 2 bedrooms. The HS consistently searches for rental units and property managers to build relationships. 2021-22 was successful by increasing TBRA placements (barrier is available housing units), STRMU provided transitional housing for homeless individuals to reduce COVID risk while awaiting TBRA placement, three vetrens received assistance with one transitioning to a permanent housing programming, improving relationships with other homeless services agencies, and ED joining regional planning council. 36 clients received TBRA, 28 STRMU, and 11 PHP. 2 TBRA clients deceased, 2 TBRA clients removed due to program compliance issues, and 5 TBRA clients transitioned from TBRA due to income stability We're Northeast Indiana Positive Resource Connection. We provide HIV education, prevention, testing and linkage to care for persons living with HIV/AIDS, their families and loved ones, persons at risk for HIV, and the general public. The Positive Resource Connection proudly serves the following counties in northeast Indiana: Adams, Allen, DeKalb, Huntington, Kosciusko, LaGrange, Noble, Steuben, Wabash, Wells, and Whitley.

Positive Resource Connection is open Monday, Tuesday, Thursday 8:00AM - 4:30PM, Wednesday 9:00AM- 7:00PM and Friday from 8:00 AM - 1:00 PM, excluding holidays. Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) - Positive Resource Connection has offered this assistance program for several years, providing eligible clients with long-term tenant-based rental assistance, short-term rental assistance, and utility assistance. Food and Nutrition Program - Implemented in 1996, Positive Resource Connection offers a food and nutrition program that provides low-income persons living with HIV/AIDS with food vouchers from the Community Harvest Food Bank on a monthly basis. PRC also provides a nonperishable food pantry to clients in need of food or hygiene items on an emergency basis. Direct Emergency Financial Assistance (DEFA) - This program helps eligible clients pay for their initial doctor visits, lab fees, and medications until they are eligible for other assistance programs. Client Emergency Assistance Program - Established several years ago, the client emergency fund provides persons living with HIV/AIDS with financial assistance not covered under HOPWA, food and nutrition, and emergency medical assistance. Support Groups - Positive Resource Connection provides support groups on a weekly or monthly basis for persons living with HIV/AIDS, friends and family members of HIV-positive persons, and Spanish-speaking HIV-positive persons and their families. MAC Food Program - The MAC Food Program is designed for individuals with a low CD4 cell count, an opportunistic infection, an AIDS diagnosis, or for people who may be at risk of wasting. The MAC program is a food delivery program that provides eligible individuals with at least half of the monthly calorie requirements to maintain or gain weight. Special Population Support Program (SPSP) - This program is available to anyone who is HIV+ (you do not have to be a client of Positive Resource Connection) and is interested in exploring options ______________________________________________________________________________ Previous editions are obsolete Page 10 form HUD-40110-D (Expiration Date: 11/30/2023) OMB Approval No. 2506-0133 to reduce or cease their substance use/abuse. Outreach staff take a team approach to reducing the number of new HIV infections that occur in northeast Indiana each year. To meet the need for prevention in our community, the Positive Resource Connection has several programs available: HIV/STD prevention and education; HIV testing and harm reduction youth education and empowerment; pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP); street outreach; and general awareness. All of these programs are free of charge to the public. \"Hoosier Hills AIDS Coalition (HHAC) has been designated as the lead agency for the SE Indiana since the HOPWA program began in the early/mid 1990s with the coalistion administrating the program in affiliation with the Clark Co. Health Department (CCHD). CCHD administers the HIV/STD/Syringe Services Program, which prov ides case management, counseling and testing for HIV/HEP C, syphilis and STD's, Disease Intervention, Special Populations Support Program (SPSP), PREP clinic and the syringe exchange. This program serves 14 counties and receives the Kentucky HOPWA entitlement. CCHD is a co-founder of HHAC and continutes to sponsor and support the programs. Having the coalition located in the health department office continues to help our clients with housing opportunities and direct emergency assistance through HHAC/CCHD being the lead agency in SE Indiana for numberous years. Having the housing program helps the clients maintain stable housing as well as the case managers being able to manage the client's health concerns. HHAC/CCHD are active members of the Housing Coalition of Southern Indiana (HCSI) This is a multi- county/regional effort which has a coverage area that essentially includes all of our 14 counties of our service region. HHAC/CCHD has worked with Haven House/Catalyst (local homeless shelter) for several years., frequently placing HOPWA and non-HOPWA clients in with their homeless shelter or the transitional housing units. Close working relationships are established with local landlords and CCHD in order to reduce the risk of homelessness amongst our clients. Once a landlord learns that they can trust our agency they are more likely to rent to our clients and to give good referrals for other housing opportunities. We ensure all HOPWA application intakes review all appropriate community resources - including Energy Assistance Programs, Township Trustees office, Salvation Army, and other such community agencies. We refer every client to apply for Section 8/Income Based Housing Programs. We review client's housing situation/home to ensure that client is in an appropriate (healthy, clean, safe) environment and has access to needed services (like public transportation and Tare 3). Case Managers are accessible to our clients during our regular business hours. We have individual telephone contact numbers and a main telephone line where the client can be assisted by another case manager if they cannot reach their own. We as case managers have a same day response policy, in which we will respond back to clients that leave us a message on our voicemails within twenty-four hours.\" AIDS Ministries: AMAA is nonprofit AIDS service organization that provides medical and social programs to PLWHA in North Central Indiana. AMAA has been serving the community for 30 years and operates a variety of housing programs including emergency placement, RRH, TH, PH, and HOPWA. With our HOPWA funds we provide STRMU, TBRA, OPS, and Housing Information. With these extra COVID funds we were awarded we used them to provided STRMU assistance to those who had COVID and were unable to work or needed additional assistance. Aspire Indiana Housing began operation in 2009 after it was created by Aspire Indiana, a Community Mental Health Center that has served Madison, Hamilton, Boone, and Marion counties since 1973. Aspire Indiana recognized the need to address the steadily rising population of the homeless within our communities. Since our creation, we have worked alongside Aspire Indiana to achieve our mission, \"together...making health and well-being a reality.\" Together Aspire Indiana and Aspire Indiana Housing provide a wide range of wraparound services that address the social determinants of health - finances, housing, physical health, mental health, and social health - that affect client outcomes. Aspire Indiana Housing serves our communities through various programs: Section 8 housing, Permanent Supportive Housing, HUD-VASH, Healthcare for the Homeless, the Emergency Food and Shelter Program, VA Homeless Providers Grant & Per Diem Program, Veterans Justice Outreach Initiative, Supportive Services for Veterans' Families (SSVF), Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities, Grants for the Benefit of Homeless Individuals, and Assistance for Victims of Sexual Assault and Domestic Violence. We have over 300 apartments available to engage our clients in permanent supportive housing and are expanding our services further to ensure that as many people as ______________________________________________________________________________ Previous editions are obsolete Page 11 form HUD-40110-D (Expiration Date: 11/30/2023) OMB Approval No. 2506-0133 b. Annual Performance under the Action Plan Provide a narrative addressing each of the following four items: 1. Outputs Reported. Describe significant accomplishments or challenges in achieving the number of housing units supported and the number households assisted with HOPWA funds during this operating year compared to plans for this assistance, as approved in the Consolidated Plan/Action Plan. Describe how HOPWA funds were distributed during your operating year among different categories of housing and geographic areas to address needs throughout the grant service area, consistent with approved plans. IU- Positive Link assisted 89 households throughout the year with housing assistance and case management services. Positive Link served 29 households in the TBRA program. Households accessing TBRA funds reside currently in Greene, Vigo, Vermillion and Monroe counties. Positive Link served 50 households with short term assistance in 9 of the 10 counties covered by the grant with 78% residing in Monroe and Vigo County. COVID-19 contributed to loss of income for many households this past year and a half resulting in the need for additional support from both Positive Link and other community agencies. 20 households accessed PHP for security and first month's rent with 10 households utilizing PHP in conjunction with TBRA. All clients were able to access a variety of resources though case management which helped with stabilization and long-term housing goals. In addition, if not already, clients were connected with a medical case manager that assisted them with their options for health care, as a result 100% of housing clients accessed or maintained health coverage during the program year. The Aliveness Project of NWI (APNWI) served a total of 67 consumers during the 2021-2022 fiscal year. 35 received TBRA, 24 received STRMU, 8 received PHP. Internally we dealt with many personnel changes that required adjustments, but we were still able to meet our consumers' needs. While consumers receive HOPWA assistance we also make sure to consider other housing subsidies that they may benefit from such as Section 8 or Public Housing. During this previous fiscal year, we were able to complete applications and have four (4) consumers added to the Hammond Section 8 Housing Waitlist. This will provide consumers with the opportunity to continue receiving housing assistance for a long period of time. Another success we would like to consider is the ending of two (2) consumers TBRA. During the time assistance was received, they were able to increase their income above the poverty level and become independent with their daily living expenses. HOPWA was able to provide 3 consumers who were homeless with a stable living environment. During the program year, HOPWA program funds were distributed among the different categories as 57% AIDS Resource Group- TBRA is assigned to clients currently homeless or impending homeless. 66.3% of grant budget was allocated to TBRA. Although STRMU is helpful, the majority of rental assistance is placed through TBRA. TBRA provides a longer assistance period and a client can transition concurrently to next grant year without a pause in services. TBRA can help a client manage rental payment when first obtaining income until able to manage on own or transition to income based housing. Additional clients could have been added to TBRA if more landlords would accept program or more units were available to rent. Landlords accepting HOPWA assistance have limited units. STRMU assistance was largely used to house clients in transitional housing to avoid prolonged shelter stays to reduce exposure to COVID. Clients possible are able to attain a stable living environment. As a safety-net provider, we make all of our services available to all people regardless of their ability to pay. It is our goal to extend the lives of the people we serve, improve their outlook, and serve as many clients as possible in order to better our community as a whole. Between all of our services at Aspire Indiana, Aspire Indiana Housing, and our primary care sister organization, Aspire Indiana Health, we serve over 20,000 people across our four county footprint.However, Aspire Indiana has been the HIV Care Coordination for the Indiana Department of Health in Region 6 (office in Madison County) since 2000 and began providing HOPWA shortly after establishing the Care Coordination program. The program expanded in the early 2000's to include Regions 4 (office in Tippecanoe County), 5 (office in Delaware County), and 9 (office in Wayne County). This HIV Care Coordination program service area includes 32 counties. ______________________________________________________________________________ Previous editions are obsolete Page 12 form HUD-40110-D (Expiration Date: 11/30/2023) OMB Approval No. 2506-0133 needing repeated utility assistance were referred to community utility assistance programs for extended service periods. Monthly bus passes were provided to clients with employment, enrolled in school, or enrolled in daily treatment programs. AIDS Ministries: Major accomplishments including being able to provide additional rental assistance to clients who were ill. These included those who were not able to work, hospitalized, or lack resources due to COVID. 2. Outcomes Assessed. Assess your program's success in enabling HOPWA beneficiaries to establish and/or better maintain a stable living environment in housing that is safe, decent, and sanitary, and improve access to care. Compare current year results to baseline results for clients. Describe how program activities/projects contributed to meeting stated goals. If program did not achieve expected targets, please describe how your program plans to address challenges in program implementation and the steps currently being taken to achieve goals in next operating year. If your program exceeded program targets, please describe strategies the program utilized and how those contributed to program successes. IU- Positive Link accomplished positive outcomes for the operating year with 97% of clients remaining in or transitioning off TBRA into stable, permanent housing. 3 households were able to transition off the program with HCV or VASH vouchers enabling them to maintain affordable housing indefinitely. Although not shown in these numbers, housing case managers have found that landlords in the community are less likely to work with our clients and so many clients with vouchers were unsuccessful in locating housing. Low occupancy rates and clients with challenging backgrounds have impacted housing support personnel's ability to secure housing for a portion of clients in need. This year we saw decrease in the recidivism rate for short term asssistance with 40% of clients requesting assistance 2 to 3 consecutive years, compared to 49% the previous year. The 49% recidivism was expected given the economic climate and the impact of COVID 19, the slight decrease seems intuitive as the community started transitioning out of strict pandemic protocols. 92% of household assisted with STRMU funds were stable at the end of the grant year. The Aliveness Project have been successful in enabling HOPWA beneficiaries to establish and/or better maintain a stable living environment in housing that is safe and sanitary. All of the beneficiaries were either homeless or at risk of homelessness when they entered the program. Successful strategies for helping households maintain housing include creating and maintaining positive relationships with landlords to help avoid terminations and eviction. The APNWI Housing Coordinator), continues to prioritize building relationships with tenants and fostering a safe and healthy community environment leading to increased coordination with community partners and subsequent decreases in tenant isolation. Housing Case Managers are paired or teamed up with Medical & Non Medical Case Managers for more streamlined care. APNWI continues to work with zero income households to increase their income by providing the consumers with information regarding upcoming job fairs, and other employment opportunities as well as assistance with completing social security disability applications. Households continue to report loss of income or employment, ascribable to the COVID- 19 pandemic, reducing their ability to pay a tenant portion, and creating an increased need for support from staff and financial assistance from their housing program/subsidy. Many TBRA households have required recertification of rent due to lost or greatly reduced income. Income losses among assisted households increased subsidy costs, reducing the number of households that APNWI are able to assist without additional funding to cover these costs. Aspire- All clients complete a housing plan with their HIV Non-Medical Case Manager and they receive ongoing non-medical case management to assist them in maintaining a household budget, access to ______________________________________________________________________________ Previous editions are obsolete Page 13 form HUD-40110-D (Expiration Date: 11/30/2023) OMB Approval No. 2506-0133 medical care and behavioral healthcare, accessing community resources, and any other referrals they may need to help them meet the goals stated on the housing plan. With the assistance of the HIV Non- Medical Case Manager, clients are able to develop skills necessary to meet the needs on their own to guide them towards self-sufficiency. Because of their involvement with the Non-Medical Case Managers, approximately 95% of clients who chose to remain engaged in the HOPWA and Non-Medical Case Management program were able to establish and/or maintain a stable living environment in housing that is safe, decent, and sanitary. Additionally all clients receiving HOPWA were assisted with accessing or maintaining healthcare coverage and medical care. AIDS Resource Group- The HS addresses living conditions to ensure the client is living in a safe, decent, and sanitary environment. If the listed factors are not met, HS addresses with client and Landlord. In order to maintain health and stability, the housing program requires the unit meet inspection guidelines which are required in the Housing Guidelines. Clients learn the importance of a stable environment affecting health and improving HIV adherence. ARG did not set target goals for this factor as clients are not encouraged to live in a place which could negatively impact health. If an unit is not meeting HOPWA Inspection throughout grant year, HS speaks with LL to repair the issues. Clients are encouraged to seek a new place to live when lease is to be renewed if issues continue. HS does remind client of importance of keeping housing clean, trash free, and how cleanliness is for HIV health. HS meets with client quarterly in home to address the sanitary conditions portion on housing inspection as the client is responsible for maintaining sanitary conditions once moved into units. Goal setting and program implementation is always evolving to meet clients needs such as emphasing more budgeting skills and accessing community resource to expand budget in the upcoming year. AIDS Ministries: Due to these beign additional funds, we really hadn't set goals. We thought 5 people would be served with the money we received and we were able to assist 7. 3. Coordination . Report on program coordination with other mainstream housing and supportive services resources, including the use of committed leveraging from other public and private sources that helped to address needs for eligible persons identified in the Consolidated Plan/Strategic Plan. IU- Positive Link works very closely with mainstream resources as well as supportive housing programs available in our community. With the Consolidated Plan goal of reducing homelessness and increasing housing stability for special needs populations, we continue to coordinate services and resources through our Region's Housing Network. Agencies that receive CoC, ESG, HOME and CDBG funds all participate in the network. In Monroe and Vigo Counties, we were able to house several clients permanently through Housing Choice Vouchers or Public Housing units and have others that were recently added to the waitlist this last year when Monroe County's Section 8 opened again. Additionally, while not required, we work very closely with the coordinated entry process to PSH to ensure that HIV+ individuals are able to be placed in the most appropriate housing program for their situation. Aliveness- The Housing Case Manager has been able to participate in ZIP Coalition meetings,Region 1A Housing CoC meetings, and multiple resource webinars. Not only does it allow for connection with other community agencies, but creates a streamline of supportive services with partnering agencies. Because of this levering, we have been able to succeed in placing consumers in safe and stable housing. AIDS Resource Group- ARG is a member the Homeless Service Council, a collective of agencies and public officials seeking to end homeless. ARG is a member the Regional Housing Standards Planning Committee, ______________________________________________________________________________ Previous editions are obsolete Page 14 form HUD-40110-D (Expiration Date: 11/30/2023) OMB Approval No. 2506-0133 organizations leadership meet to set expectations for housing programs. ARG is the administrator of the IDOH Region 8 ZIP\u2014Zero Is Possible Committee. HS participates the annual Vanderburgh County Community Connect which reached over 600 people this year. The Community Connect brings all social services include BMV together in one place for a full day. The primary target group is the homeless/poor. HS provides housing case management to individuals receiving assistance through the Beacon Shelter + Care program. ARG has a MOU with Aurora for Service Match Grant. Clients are referred to Section 8 when application process is open. HS will assist eligible clients apply to income-based housing and provide reminders for checking back if/when a waiting list. ARG will contact other service programs when learning of new opportunities for improving housing search. ARG is the administrator of the area HIV Continuum of Care meeting. AIDS Ministries: The HOPWA program is ran in conjunction with our Care Coordination and Substance Use programs. Many of our housing participants have substance abuse and are able to get assistance through our other programs. All of our housing clients are enrolled in case management services through the Care Coordination Dept. We also utilize grant monies for DEFA and pantry for housing clients. Mental health services are done onsite or through telehealth. Aspire Indiana coordinates with local housing authorities to assist clients in applying for HUD/Section 8 when available. Aspire Indiana has established MOUs with the AIDS Service Organizations who receive HOPWA funds to cover the counties served by Aspire Indiana for Non-Medical Case Management but do not fall into the HOPWA region. Additionally, Aspire Indiana works closely with the PSH, ESG, and SSVF providers in the regions served. 4. Technical Assistance. Describe any program technical assistance needs and how they would benefit program beneficiaries. Aliveness- Continue to provide training, both in person and virtual for agency personnel who may be entering a new role. Aspire Indiana program staff could benefit from TA or training in the areas of HMIS data entry and generating useful reports from HMIS. Often this very report is completed with data that is hand-counted because the Housing Coordinator is not trained on doing the reports, but the staff who do the reportfully understand how to access that necessary data. c. Barriers and Trends Overview Provide a narrative addressing items 1 through 3. Explain how barriers and trends affected your program's ability to achieve the objectives and outcomes discussed in the previous section. 1. Describe any barriers (including regulatory and non-regulatory) encountered in the administration or implementation of the HOPWA program, how they affected your program's ability to achieve the objectives and outcomes discussed, and, actions taken in response to barriers, and recommendations for program improvement. Provide an explanation for each barrier selected. IU- We continue to find it challenging to secure safe units of housing under FMR in most of our region. This year we saw a substantial increase in rental costs for Monroe County and without the FMR waiver clients would not have been able to find homes to lease up. Vigo County does tend to have affordable units but finding willing landlords to engage with the program or with clients who have difficult backgrounds can be a challenge. Additionally, once leaving the larger towns in our region it becomes quite difficult to secure and/or maintain units under FMR that can pass habitability standards. We continue to develop relationships with various landlords who are sometimes willing to negotiate rental amounts to assist households in qualifying of our clients. AIDS Ministries: In our area housing affordability is an issue. Areas where rent is affordable are often high in crime and the other areas of the city that are safer over market due to the location. The other ______________________________________________________________________________ Previous editions are obsolete Page 15 form HUD-40110-D (Expiration Date: 11/30/2023) OMB Approval No. 2506-0133 issues we face is finding landlords and housing accessibility. Many of the units in our area are reserved for students at the university and often unavailable to our clients or landlords do not to rent to our clients due to their poor credit or criminal pasts. 2. Describe any trends in the community that may affect the way in which the needs of persons living with HIV/AIDS are being addressed, and provide any other information important to the future provision of services to this population. IU- Access to clinical care becomes more and more important, particularly with CDC formally recognizing the impact of treatment as prevention and U=U. Armed with this knowledge, utilizing HOPWA to ensure decreased barriers to accessing medical care becomes hugely impactful in stopping the spread of HIV. In addition, we are seeing a large trend of homeless, newly diagnosed people who inject drugs whom we have been working closely with to house and provide wrap around services to include behavioral health and treatment options. HOPWA's target population is at increased risk for lacking medical care; therefore, ensuring housing stability has the increased effect of also reducing disease transmission. Aliveness- In region 1, the lack of affordable housing and low vacancy rate is contributing to more unstable housing situations for households as well as increasing the length of time someone is homeless due to the amount of time it takes people to lease up in such a difficult market. There are also not nearly enough shelter beds or transitional housing options to meet the level of need. During COVID-19 shelter space has been especially challenging - while additional shelters were opened to help ensure the ability for social distancing, they did not increase capacity and shelters remain full, thus limiting taking new intakes. Also, in Region 1 there are no domestic violence shelters open for LGBTQ+ population. Complicating the matter further, leasing is even more difficult for housholds with crimininal convictions, eviction history, and limited income in the current housing market. APNWI continues to work on this as an agency and in concert with other community partners, there has been very little housing available for people with a registered sexual offence, which is even more dramatic when parolees are often free on condition of permanent shelter. Finally, households in Region 1, particularly households of color and households from new immigrant communities, face continued stigma due to their HIV status and how that translates into who asks for help from APNWI. We continue to work with community partners to make sure that households who fear disclosure are not falling through the cracks and leaving themselves tied to housing debt they cannot and will not be able to pay off without assistance. Aspire- The most notable challenge for client services is finding safe housing units that fall within the Rent Reasonable guidelines, especially in the aftermath of the COVID 19 pandemic. There is limited housing availability in rural Indiana and there were times when assistance could not be provided because the available unit exceeded Rent Reasonable guidelines. Another barrier is that Madison County, the county with the most HIV cases in the Aspire Indiana service area, is part of the ESMA. Aspire Indiana clients who reside in Madison County, where the rest of their services are located (Non- Medical Case Management, primary health, Infectious Disease Care, behavioral healthcare, etc.) are required to seek housing services from an agency located in Indianapolis or Bloomington. This leads to client confusion, client frustration, staff frustration, and significantly impacts the continuity of care. AIDS RESOURCE GROUP- Limited housing options are a great barrier to clients achieving stable housing. In our region, less landlords are accepting rental assistance programs. Also, more emphasis is being placed on rental and credit history. The clients qualifying for HOPWA usually have no rental ______________________________________________________________________________ Previous editions are obsolete Page 16 form HUD-40110-D (Expiration Date: 11/30/2023) OMB Approval No. 2506-0133 history or have one to two evictions on record. Criminal/credit checks are also a barrier for a client finding an unit and has to settle for lesser unit. HS attempts to speak with property managers trying to work out the issue. All the items listed about are barriers for clients utilizing HOPWA assistance as the clients are lower income and usually have sporadic rental history. Property managers may seek for agency to co-sign and deny renting to client when learning agency cannot be co-signer. Clients themselves can be the barrier to maintaining the stable housing as some of the clients have not had stable housing examples to follow. HS has to review and confirms understand family and friends cannot move in and out of housing per program guidelines and lease agreement. A client may be referred to program, without a wait list, and due to the items listed about may result in a several month apartment search. Budgeting is a barrier to achieving goals\u2014the agency budget limiting assistance available and the client inexperience budgeting. ARG housing guidelines must follow requirements from HOPWA/HUD which can limit the use of providers. Also, a client may be in great need for the month and will be able to get back on track the next with assistance, however due to the income guidelines client may be just over the line. Changes in background check requirements impact current housing options. Property management changes impact affordable housing available. The HS must research housing options daily for making new connections. AIDS Ministries: Since COVID, we have given our clients the option of doing programming virtual. It allows to maintain contact with our clients and our staff if readily available. Clients can access all program information via a client portal. Also for those who don't have means, we provide them with tablets. The tablets have allowed us to increase our accessibility including allowing clients to maintain their medical appointments, schedule appointments with staff, and have information they missed in a folder on the portal. 3. Identify any evaluations, studies, or other assessments of the HOPWA program that are available to the public. AIDS RESOURCE GROUP- HS meets with clients monthly to discuss issues associated with housing program. Client input is considered with annual HOPWA guideline review. Annual a client satisfaction survey is sent to clients for evaluation. AIDS Ministries: Semi-annually, we conduct a survey on our clients in regards to housing and our other services. This results are used to formulate changes among our programs. We also do exit interviews for those who leave our housing program. Also our CQM report is available.
