Meningococcal disease is a rare but potentially fatal bacterial infection. The disease is expressed as either meningococcal meningitis, an inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord or meningococcemia, the presence of bacteria in the blood. What causes meningococcal meningitis? Meningococcal disease is caused by the bacterium Neisseria meningitidis, a leading cause of meningitis and septicemia (or blood poisoning) in the United States. Meningitis is one of the most common manifestations of the disease, although it has been known to cause septic arthritis, pneumonia, brain inflammation and other syndromes. How many people were affected in the earlier outbreaks reported in India? Outbreak in 1966 During March 1966, an increased number of pyogenic meningitis cases were admitted in 5 major hospitals of Delhi. A total of 616 cases were recorded. The proportion of laboratory confirmed cases increased from 4.8% in January to 10.6% in February to reach a peak of 44.9% in May 1966. The outbreak was due to meningococcus serogroup A. The percentage of meningococcal meningitis cases followed the pattern of the incidence of pyogenic meningitis cases. Overall in 18.8% of the cases, meningococci were proved to be the causative agent. Two peaks were noticed - one in May and the other in December 1966. Outbreak in 1985-86 After a gap of about 20 years, Delhi and adjoining areas experienced another outbreak of meningococcal meningitis. The causative agent was again meningococcus serogroup A. year 1985, a total number of 6133 pyogenic meningitis cases with 799 deaths were recorded, with an overall case-fatality of 13% as compared to 1731 cases and 569 deaths in the year 1984. How is meningococcal meningitis spread? Meningococcal disease is transmitted through the air via droplets of respiratory secretions and direct contact with an infected person. Direct contact, for these purposes, is defined as oral contact with shared items such as cigarettes or drinking glasses or through intimate contact such as kissing. What are the symptoms? The early symptoms usually associated with meningococcal disease include fever, severe headache, stiff neck, rash, nausea, vomiting, and lethargy, and may resemble the flu. Because the disease progresses rapidly, often in as little as 12 hours, students are urged to seek medical care immediately if they experience two or more of these symptoms concurrently. What are different serogroup of meningococcal meningitis? Thirteen subtypes of sero groups of N.meningitides have been identified and four sero groups (namely A, B, C and W135) are recognized to cause epidemics. The pathogenicity, Immunogenicity and epidemic capabilities differ according to serogroup and its identification is crucial for containment of epidemic. Other serogroups to name a few X,Y,Z etc. are less virulent. However, fatal infections and secondary cases are known to occur with all. Is the vaccine for pre-exposure prophylaxis avilable? Vaccines against four specific antigens related to serogroups A, C, Y and W135 are currently available. They are distributed in freeze-dried form. Vaccine contains 50 ug of each antigen. The dose of vaccine is 0.5 ml given subcutaneously. Meningococcal polysaccharide vaccines are not routinely used in early childhood because of their general lack of efficacy in infants and young children below 2 years. In some countries, recruits are routinely vaccinated with A+C vaccine, at the beginning of military service. Who should be given pre exposure prophylaxis? Vaccine should be given to: Haj pilgrims High risk groups How effective is the vaccine? The meningococcal vaccine has been shown to provide protection against the most common strains of the disease, including serogroups A, C, Y and W-135. The vaccine has shown to be 85 to 100 percent effective in serogroups A and C in older children and adults. Is the vaccine safe? Are there adverse side effects to the vaccine? The vaccine is very safe and adverse reactions are mild and infrequent, consisting primarily of redness and pain at the site of injection lasting up to two days. What is the duration of protection? The duration of the meningococcal vaccine's efficacy is approximately three to five years. What is the role of Chemoprophylaxis? Chemoprophylaxis has been considered for control of meningococcal disease but it has several limitations, and its use should be limited to special circumstances. To be effective in preventing secondary cases, chemoprophylaxis must be initiated as soon as possible (i.e. not later than 48 hours after diagnosis of the case). SRK / "}
