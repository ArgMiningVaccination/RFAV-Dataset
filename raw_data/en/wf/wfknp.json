Though this disease was once considered a fact of life for school-age children, thanks to strong vaccination programs, it has now been nearly eradicated.

Steps Recognizing Measles Symptoms - 1Look for cold-like symptoms early on. One of the most frustrating aspects of the measles virus for parents and caretakers is that, at first, it often appears to be nothing serious. For about 1-5 days before the telltale rash appears, measles usually causes symptoms like those of a cold or flu. These early symptoms usually arise anywhere from 7-21 days after exposure to an infected person and include: [[3]](#_note-3)X Research source - Sore throat - Hacking cough - Sneezing - Runny nose - Swollen lymph nodes - Red, runny eyes - Sensitivity to light - More rarely, diarrhea - General malaise - Note: A person with measles can still spread the disease during this early stage. - 2Check for a fever. Measles usually causes a fairly high fever that can peak around 104\u00b0F (40\u00b0C). [[4]](#_note-4)X Research source [This fever can appear before or during the full-body rash that measles is most famous for. Usually, the fever goes away at about the same time the rash does \u2014 however, this may not be the case for all measles patients.](#) - 3Look for Koplik's spots inside the mouth. A few days after the initial cold-like symptoms begin, small red spots called Koplik's spots will usually develop on the insides of the cheeks. These spots will have a small white or bluish-white center, making them look like grains of sand, and will often be closely clustered around the areas where the molars touch the cheeks. [[5]](#_note-5)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)New England Journal of Medicine World's Leading Medical Journal [Go to source](#) - These spots will persist on their own for a few days before the full-body rash develops. If you notice these spots on yourself or someone else, it is important to take action fast, since these spots indicate that the disease is, in fact, measles, but that it has not yet reached its most contagious stage. - 4Watch for a rash that spreads from the head downwards. Within about 5 days of the initial symptoms, the well-known measles rash appears. This rash usually begins on the forehead, spreads to the rest of the face, and then progresses rapidly down the chest and back, eventually covering the whole body. The rash takes the form of raised, flat red bumps or blotches. - At this point, the measles patient is at their most infectious. Quarantine at this stage is crucial, as the infectiousness will usually last for about 4 days after the rash goes away. - Many people start to feel better about 2 days after the rash starts. After 3 or 4 days, the rash changes from red to brown then starts to fade or flake away. A cough may last for a few weeks after this time. - 5Check for inflamed eyes. The measles rash can sometimes be accompanied by conjunctivitis, a condition of the eyes. [[6]](#_note-6)X Research source [Often, conjunctivitis arises when the facial rash is especially bad. This uncomfortable condition can cause symptoms similar to pink eye, including:](#) Advertisement - Inflammation - Pink/red appearance - Watering - Discharge - Eyes sealing shut during sleep Taking Adequate Precautions - 1Contact a doctor immediately if you or someone you know has measles. Because measles is highly contagious, it is important to notify your doctor as soon as you suspect you (or someone you know) has it. Although measles is not responsive to antibiotics, your doctor still needs to diagnose your disease, monitor your symptoms, and may even need to treat secondary infections caused by the virus. Most treatment for measles itself is supportive \u2014 that is, it's designed to keep your symptoms manageable so that you can get better naturally - Don't show up unannounced at your doctor's office with a case of the measles. Always phone ahead. Because measles is so contagious, your doctor may not want measles patients to be near the other patients, especially if they are very young or their immune systems are weakened. Your doctor may, for instance, advise you to use a separate entrance or to wear a mask into the office. - If a case of measles is confirmed, your doctor will notify the health department. The department will contact you directly to get more information since their goal is to track measles cases and prevent the virus from spreading. - 2Avoid direct contact with others if you have measles. Measles is very, very contagious. About 90% of un-vaccinated people who are around someone with measles will get the disease. [[7]](#_note-7)X Research source [While it's not typically a life-threatening disease for healthy people, it can pose serious problems for people in at-risk groups, like the very young, pregnant people, and people with weakened immune systems. Thus, to protect these people, it is very important to do everything you can to prevent others from getting the disease.](#) - Children under 12 months of age are most susceptible to measles since they are not vaccinated for measles until they reach their first birthday. - Staying at home except for medical visits is a must \u2014 be sure to contact your work or school to notify them of the situation. Measles is contagious from 4 days before the rash appears to about 4 days after the rash appears. [[8]](#_note-8)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services [Go to source](#)You may want to give yourself an extra day or 2 of \"safety time\" on top of this. - If you are forced to interact with others, be sure to put on a surgical mask: measles is spread when tiny droplets of moisture expelled from sneezes or coughs are inhaled by another person. The virus can remain infectious in the air for 2 hours and can also be spread if someone touches a contaminated surface then touches their mouth, nose, or eyes.

If someone in your family has measles or has recently been around someone who has had measles, you may be safe if you have been vaccinated or you can get vaccinated quickly. The measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is very effective at preventing new cases of measles. After 2 doses of the vaccine, 95% of people will have immunity to the virus. [[10]](#_note-10)X Research source [In some rare cases, it is still possible to get the virus after being vaccinated, but in these cases, the virus tends to be less severe and less contagious.](#) - Immunity against measles is usually for life. Once you have either received the vaccine or had the illness, you won't be able to get it again. - Note: People who were vaccinated before 1968 with the inactive version of measles may still be vulnerable to measles, as early vaccines were not as long-lasting as they are today. [[11]](#_note-11)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services [Go to source](#) - It's especially important to get vaccinated against measles if you plan to travel internationally. If you plan to bring a child over 6 months to another country, they can get vaccinated for measles early. - Any teens or adults who don't have immunity should get 2 doses of the MMR vaccine at least 28 days apart. - 4Don't believe harmful myths about measles vaccines. Measles vaccines have unfortunately become the source of controversy, leading some parents to keep their children from receiving them. While this may be well-intentioned, neglecting to vaccinate a child against measles can have serious consequences. Here are some facts about the MMR vaccine: Advertisement - The MMR vaccine does not cause autism. [[12]](#_note-12)X Research source [A single, fraudulent study in the 80s which suggested this possibility has since been discredited many times.](#) [[13]](#_note-13)X Research source [Autism is inborn, not caused by parental choices. Also, people cannot die of autism, but measles can kill.](#) - The MMR vaccine is safe for healthy people. Side effects are almost always minor, such as a low fever or small rash. In very rare cases, more serious symptoms may occur, but these are less dangerous than the virus itself. However, don't get the MMR vaccine if you are pregnant. - The measles vaccine is well understood. The measles vaccine has been rigorously studied and tested. - \"Natural\" exposure to measles is dangerous. Measles can rarely have serious complications, including death, while the vaccine involves much less suffering. In addition, this \"natural\" approach risks infecting babies, the elderly, and immunocompromised people, who are also more likely to seriously suffer and die. - The MMR vaccine is the safest way to protect a person and their community from the measles. - The MMR vaccine does not cause autism. Expert Q&A [Add New Question] [Submit] Video Tips - See your doctor if you were vaccinated for measles before 1968 or if you never received a booster vaccination. If you have not contracted measles yet, you may not be immune to it.Thanks - Children should receive the first dose of the measles vaccine at 12-15 months and the second dose at 4-6 years of age.Thanks Warnings - Although not common, complications from measles include ear infections, croup, pneumonia, and inflammation on the brain. These rare but serious complications make the measles vaccine a necessity for anyone who can safely receive it (which is the vast majority of people.)Thanks - Note that some people, like very young children, pregnant people, and those with weakened immune systems, should not receive the MMR vaccine.Thanks References - About this article Reader Success Stories - \"I just had measles and everything that was written in this article "}
