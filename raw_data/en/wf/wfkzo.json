It is hay fever and environmental allergy season! Canadians are far too familiar with these cold like symptoms and consequently are far too familiar with the allergy section at the drug store. Living with seasonal allergies can be torture to many especially when it impacts your ability to enjoy outdoor activities after a long winter of being cooped up indoors. Many people are quick to reach for over the counter allergy meds that may provide temporary relief of symptoms but often reap havoc on the liver and can cause unwanted side effects. Natural alternatives such as homeopathy can provide individuals with relief from allergy symptoms without the use of suppressive medications that cause more complex health concerns. Hay fever is described as a type of seasonal rhinitis typified by an allergic reaction to pollen causing a release of histamine by the body and inflammation of the mucous membranes (eye, nose, and airway). This is a very physical/material way to look at allergies. When you look at allergies from a more holistic point of view it is easy to see that it is the individuals inability to resist the allergen that is the issue, and that the allergen is merely the trigger and not the problem. Treating the symptoms alone is not the answer, and avoiding allergens in not truly living. What needs to be addressed with any dis-ease, including allergies, is the strength of your constitution and immune system. Homeopathy strengthens your constitution; creating deep and profound healing by naturally activating the body's self-healing mechanisms. We become less affected by typically harmless substances (allergens) when our constitution is strong as opposed to being over-reactive and hypersensitive. In general, allergies are a reflection of an imbalance in the body. A homeopath will select one remedy that addresses this imbalance, fits your unique expression of allergy symptoms as well as your complete symptom picture (mental/emotion/physical picture). Overtime the remedy will help your body to heal itself and overcome allergy symptoms as a result of addressing the root cause of your health concerns. There are numerous combination homeopathic remedies that can potentially help your allergies. These products are a more natural, side-effect free option, that may be helpful to some patients but can be very disappointing to others. These quick-fix remedies may provide temporary relief of your symptoms much like conventional allergy medications or offer no relief what so ever because they do not address the individual imbalance and cause of your allergies. Lasting cure can only take place after a professional homeopath has conducted a thorough case taking of your health concerns and has chosen a remedy unique to you. There is no one remedy to treat one condition as there is conventional medicine. Rather each allergy sufferer may require very different homeopathic remedies. If you live in the GTA and are interested in the treating your allergies naturally and effectively or have any questions about the further benefits of constitutional homeopathic care, please contact the Ontario College of Homeopathic Medicine's Student Clinic.
