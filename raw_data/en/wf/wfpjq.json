Nowadays, TCM has attracted extensive attentionsacross the country and the support for TCM has become part of the national strategy (Anonymous, 2019 ;Anonymous, 2021 ). A fundamental policy of China is that equal importance is attached to TCM and western medicine. In the treatment of diseases, forinstance the ght against COVID-19, TCM and western medicine are often used in an integrated medicine approach ( Chan et al., 2020 ;Du et al., 2020 ;Ren et al., 2020 ), in which the strengths of TCM with modern medicine (western medicine) are combined to improve clinicaleffects of healthcare interventions ( Wang and Xu, 1997 ;Anonymous, 2015 ). In particular, the unique features of TCM -holism and treatment ba sed on syndrome identi cation -are demonstrated in combination with practice of western medicine. Over the past decades, this practice pattern received wide acceptance in the Chinese healthcare system and the unique roles of TCM in the diseases prevention and treatment, for exampleacupuncture for migraine prophylaxis ( Zhao treatment ( Liu et al., 2017 ), are increasingly recognized by the international community (Anonymous, 2020 ). However, TCM interventions are a highly complex system. The prescription of TCM interventions is usually individualized that is based on four theoreticalfoundations, including the combination of syndrome and disease for diagnosis, dynamicevolution of disease syndromes, treatment based on syndrome identi cation, and the integrated principle-method-recipe-medicines approach. Under these theoretical framework, dynamic changes of syndromes would require changes in prescription ( Shi et al., 2021 ). The emergence of evidence-based medicine brings new ideas and methods -such as randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews -to the generation of evidence on clinical effects ( Djulbegovic and Guyatt, 2017 ;Tian et al., 2021 ). However, clear differences in theoretical bases and underlying philosophies between TCM and western medicine inevitablypresents signi cant challenges in assessing clinical effects of TCM interventions. The development of clinical research methodologies that speci cally address clinical effects of TCM is vital to the innovation and thriving of TCM and represents a key strategy for TCMmodernization ( Wang and Huang, 2019 ). In this article, we discussed potential strategies,Edited by: Ashwell Rungano Ndhlala, University of Limpopo, South Africa Reviewed by: Xing Liao, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, China *Correspondence: Xin Sun sunxin@wchscu.cn Hongcai Shang shanghongcai@126.com These authors have contributed equally to this work and share rst authorship Specialty section: This article was submitted to Ethnopharmacology, a section of the journal Frontiers in Pharmacology Received: 28 May 2021 Accepted: 26 August 2021 Published: 07 September 2021 Citation: Sun X, Li L, Liu Y, Wang W, Yao M, Tan J, Ren Y, Deng K, Ma Y, Wang Y, Chen J, Huang W, Xia Q, Li Y and Shang H (2021) Assessing Clinical Effects of Traditional Chinese Medicine Interventions: Moving Beyond Randomized Controlled Trials.

ASSESSING CLINICAL EFFECTS OF TCM INTERVENTIONS IN THE CONTEXT OFINTEGRATIVE MEDICINE: MOVINGBEYOND RANDOMIZED CONTROLLEDTRIALS medicine framework usually treats classical RCTs (i.e., explanatory RCTs) as the gold standard, and combines otherresearch methods (e.g., cohort studies) to develop a hierarchy of evidence ( Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, 2011 ). However, due to complexity of TCM interventions and its differences fromwestern medicine, it is unlikely that RCTs can fully re flect features of TCM interventions. In the past decades, efforts from themethodology community were mainly centered on therapeuticefcacy; this focus may result that other equally important questions such as effectiveness or safety in real-world clinicalsetting are less attended. Additionally, this researchpattern -intensive focus on classical RCT -often has limitations in integrating complex theories and practical features of TCMinterventions. The resulting ndings may not re flect the nature of TCM interventions. Therefore, an enhanced approach is strongly desirable. In addressing complexities of TCM interventions, one strategy is standardization of important diagnosis andtreatment factors that have potential impacts on theestimates of treatment effects of TCM interventions. Inview of the complexities of TCM interventions andchallenges of standardizing TCM features (e.g., syndromes),a progressive standardizatio n strategy may be applied when assessing clinical effects of TCM interventions, that is, rst achieve standardization of those fully or largely standardizablefactors, then partially standardizable factors. For example, the assessment of clinical effects of TCM interventions may be based on three different disease diagnoses models, includingdisease diagnosis using western medicine theory, diagnosisusing TCM-based syndrome differentiation, or a combinationof both ( Anonymous, 2015 ). While the rst is often standardized, the complexity of TCM interventions maynot be fully represented. Diagnosis of diseases purely basedon TCM theory is often variable and less standardized. In suchcase, a diagnosis may be made primarily based on westernmedicine, and the addition of disease differentiation usingTCM theory may strengthen the feature of TCM interventions. The other strategy is the development of innovative methods, in addition to explanatory RCTs, to embrace the complexities ofTCM interventions, since standardization is unlikely applicable toall cases or scenarios of TCM interventions. In addressing thediversity of TCM interventions, it is necessary to build a problem-oriented methodology approach that encompasses all relevantresearch questions about TCM interventions and addresses research needs at different stages or phases. DEVELOPING AN INTEGRATED METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH FORASSESSING TCM INTERVENTIONS:FOCUSING ON STANDARDIZABLE TCMINTERVENTIONS Acupuncture and Chinese patent medicines are commonly used therapeutic modalities in integrative medicine. They are highlystandardizable and widely recognized interventions both inChina and abroad. However, even for such therapeuticmodalities, the applicable methodologies for assessing their treatment effects still differ with those for western medicine. The key question about acupuncture and Chinese patentmedicine is how their evidence contains features of TCMwhile treatment effects are reliably assessed. Although classical RCTs carry strong interval validity, they are never enough largely due to it s restrictions in study factors (e.g., setting, population and interventions) and the resultinglimitations to re flect TCM features. The last two decades have witnessed the rise of practice-based research, whereby real-world data generated from routine practice are primarilyused for research ( Sherman et al., 2016 ;Sun et al., 2018 ). This feature particularly ts for the characteristics of acupuncture and Chinese patent medicines, in whichpractical variations are allowed while standardization isfeasible. However, such studies are often observational innature and are subject to bias. In addressing the limitations of the current approaches, we propose an integrated methodological approach for assessingclinical effects of acupuncture and Chinese patent medicines(eRCT-pRCT-RCDOS-REGOS, 4R, Figure 1 ). Explanatory trials and studies at real-world practice setting are mergedthrough a stepwise manner, and research questions at differentstages -e.g., ef cacy versus effectiveness -are addressed. In the two extremes between explanatory trials and observational studies with routinely collected data, the TCM features are increasinglyinvolved. Consequently, all these four research methods, in acollective manner, contribute to reliable and comprehensiveassessment of clinical effects of acupuncture and Chinesepatent medicines. Within this integrated methodological approach, explanatory randomized controlled trials (eRCTs) may be used at early stageto establish ef cacy of acupuncture and Chinese patent medicine. Although rigorous in design and having relatively low risk of bias,it may contain fewer features of TCM. Once the ef cacy is established, research at real-world practice setting -that allows more flexible inclusion of study population and interventions -would be conducted. Pragmatic randomized controlled trials (pRCTs) represent an important vehicle toestablish effectiveness of acupuncture and Chinese patentmedicines in the real-world settings. This method integratesmore features of TCM interventions, and combines advantages Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org September 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 713071 2Sun et al. Assessing Effects of TCM Interventionsof explanatory trials (e.g., randomization), and such, it may be an ideal option for assessing clinical effectiveness of TCMinterventions ( Zuidgeest et al., 2017 ;Shi et al., 2021 ). Observational studies using routinely collected data (RCDOS) or observational studies using patient registry data(REGOS) are two research approaches alternative to pRCTs thatmay be used for assessing clinical effects of acupuncture andChinese patent medicines. Despite their signi cant strengths in collection of real-world practice data, these two approachesoften suffer from serious limitations due to the nature ofobservational designs. Nevertheless, they may offerirreplicable advantages in assessing syndrome-driventreatment heterogeneity, understanding changes of treatmentpattern, assessing real-world safety particularly those rareadverse reactions, exploring component effect in case of complex interventions, investigating interactions between western medicine and TCM, and predicting clinical effects ofindividual patients. Across all these methods, one critical issue is how to infuse the theory and features of TCM into methodological components.Despite relatively high degree of standardization when usingacupuncture and Chinese patent medicine, objective complexfactors continue to present challenges in assessing clinical effects,including outcome measurements that are applicable to TCMfeatures ( Wang and Huang, 2019 ;Zhang et al., 2021 ), effect estimation in rare event setting ( Greenland et al., 2016 ), study designs involving patient preferences ( Angell, 1984 ;R\u00fccker, 1989 ; Cameron et al., 2018 ), repeated measures in TCM setting ( Albert, 1999 ;Twisk, 2004 ;Goetgeluk and Vansteelandt, 2008 ;Wang et al., 2012 ), causal inference of treatment effects in complex design and data settings ( Zigler and Dominici, 2014 ;Koch et al.,2020 ), and decomposition of effects in complex intervention setting. Continuing efforts are warranted to address these issues. USE OF INTEGRATED APPROACH FOR ASSESSING CLINICAL EFFECTS OFPOST-APPROVAL CHINESE PATENTMEDICINES: PRACTICAL EXAMPLES Post-approval Chinese patent medicines are often faced with important evidence gaps. Because the approval of Chinese patentmedicines usually relies on traditional clinical trials, the resultingndings are often subject to restrictions in study designs. Therefore, post-approval studies of Chinese patent medicines are critical. Suchstudies usually aim to establish clinical effects in the context of TCMtheory, whereby TCM features are increasingly present. These may include effectiveness, long-term effects, safety and heterogeneity in effects among subpopulations with varying characteristics (e.g.,differential syndromes). In the past years, efforts have beenmade to apply the proposed approach for assessing post-approval Chinese patent medicines among selected diseases, forwhich TCM interventions may have special advantages ( Figure 2 ). For example, stroke is characterized by high morbidity, disability, mortality, recurrence and economic burden ( Virani et al., 2020 ). Although treatments with western medicine, such as intravenous thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy, haveclear effect on patients with acute ischemic stroke, limitedtreatment options are available for patients with ischemic stroke in recovery and sequelae stages ( Powers et al., 2018 ). Early evidence suggested ef cacy of Chinese patent medicines on the lowering of FIGURE 1 | Integrated approach for assessing clinical effects of traditional Chinese medicine (i.e., 4R approach).

Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org September 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 713071 3Sun et al. Assessing Effects of TCM Interventionsstroke complications and improvement of stroke sequelae ( Li et al., 2017;Liang et al., 2018 ;Liu et al., 2018 ). However, there continues to be major evidence gaps, including effectiveness and safety anddifferential effects by varying TCM features among patients in real-world clinical setting. In our efforts to address these evidence needs, we have developed two stroke-speci c databases, including one multicenter stroke- specic registry database from TCM hospitals and one nationwide stroke-speci c routinely collected healthcare database from western medicine hospitals. We initially applied dataprocessing technologies and common data model to standardizethe data. We then applied the integrated approach to undertake studies addressing a series of research questions about clinical effects of Chinese patent medicines, including investigation of diseaseburden and treatment patterns of stroke using cross-sectionaldesign; understanding types of C hinese medicine syndromes and regional distribution of acute cereb ral and acute cerebral infarction, using model-based multidimensional clustering analysis;assessment of effectiveness and safety of Chinese patent medicines(e.g., TCM injection on top of routine thrombolysis treatment)among patients at stroke sequelae, using retrospective cohortstudy design and casual model; and development of a model forpredicting individual treatment effects among patients with Chinese patent medicines treatments, based on machine learning methods. In another example, effective treatments of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) usually include surgery, chemotherapy,radiotherapy, molecular targeting and immunotherapy(Postmus et al., 2017 ). However, drug resistance and adverse reactions are two major limitations of these treatment options,which, in return, seriously compromise quality of life of patients(Chinese Medical Association, 2020 ). TCM may have advantages in alleviating adverse reactions caused by typical westernmedicine and raising patient immunity, thus improving quality of life, and potentially prolonging survival ( Li et al., 2019 ;Yang et al., 2020 ). Nevertheless, evidence is lacking. In the efforts to address this important evidence gap, we established a multicenter postoperative NSCLC patientregistry, whereby we applied the integrated approach toaddress issues about clinical effects of Chinese patentmedicines for cancer patients. These included a multi-centerpRCT that compared Zhongliuping 3 formula versus usualcare to examine its effects on clinical symptoms and quality oflife in NSCLC patients after surgery, in which multiple datasources were collected; a multi-center pRCT that compared Shenlingcao oral liquid versus usual care among NSCLC patients after receiving surgery to con rm its effect on quality of life and alleviation of serious adverse reactions caused bychemotherapy; and a cohort study using data from multicenterpRCTs to analyze long-term effectiveness, safety andheterogeneity in effects among different syndromes. CONCLUSION In this paper, we proposed an integrated approach (i.e., 4Rapproach) that combines the strengths of classical RCTs andpractice-based research, and infuses TCM theories and featuresinto key study characteristics. Through this approach, thechallenges may be effectively addressed in assessing clinicaleffects of TCM interventions. We also provided practicalexamples about the use of integrated approaches for assessingclinical effects of post-approval Chinese patent medicines instroke and lung cancer patients. However, this approach hasnot been widely tested, and more applications are warranted. We FIGURE 2 | Use of the integrated approach for assessing clinical effects of post-approval Chinese patent medicines.
