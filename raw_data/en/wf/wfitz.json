Aromatherapy anointing bestows healing, honor, devotion, and blessings. It is not the source of what is bestowed\u2014it is merely a tool to help strengthen and manifest the intention of it. More than 80 different essential oils are profiled. The information includes their spiritual teachings, their affect on subtle anatomy (energy centers and subtle bodies), the occasions for their use, blessings, and affirmations. Directions are given for creating sacred space, enhancing sacred space, making aromatherapy anointing oils, and performing anointing ceremonies. Eleven different anointing ceremonies categories are explained in detail, including Rite of Passage, Healing, Honoring, Gratitude, Love and Devotion, and Holidays. In this 2nd edition, there are: 30 additional, new essential oils profiled, more examples of how people use anointing today, more and updated resources, and more recipes for anointing oils and anointing oil blends. There is also more information on the energy centers, essential oils for the seasons, essential oils used for sacred space; and essential oils that coordinate with the solstices, equinoxes, and moon stages. There are 4 new appendixes: the essential oils that relate to fruits of the spirit, attributes of the essential oils, primary characteristics of the essential oils, and how the essential oils relate to different archangels.
