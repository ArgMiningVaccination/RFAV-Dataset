Find answers to some of your Medicare Supplement questions Medicare Supplement insurance plans (also known as Medigap plans) are offered by private insurance companies to help pay some of the out-of-pocket costs that Original Medicare (which includes Part A and Part B) doesn't pay. Some plans pay most of your out of pocket costs, but have a higher monthly premium. Other plans pay fewer out-of-pocket costs, but have a lower monthly premium. Benefits and costs vary depending on the plan chosen. No. A Medicare Supplement insurance plan works with Original Medicare, which includes Part A and Part B. It helps cover some of the out-of-pocket health care costs that Original Medicare doesn't pay for. For instance, Medicare Part B generally covers about 80% of Part B expenses. You're responsible for paying the rest. A Medicare Supplement insurance plan could help pay your share. Your costs can include the following: Monthly Premium This is the fee you pay to the plan in exchange for coverage. Each Medicare Supplement insurance plan has a dierent monthly premium. Deductible This is the amount you pay out-of-pocket for covered services before Medicare and/or your Medicare Supplement plan begins to pay. It's a pre-set, xed cost. Most Medicare Supplement plans provide coverage for your Medicare Part A hospital deductible. In most cases, you're responsible for your Medicare Part B deductible. Copay/Coinsurance These are kinds of cost sharing. A copay is a set, flat amount paid each time, such as a $20 copay for each in-office doctor visit. Coinsurance requires you to pay a percentage of the Medicare-approved amount each time. Out-of-Pocket Limit/Maximum This is a maximum amount of out-of-pocket costs you pay per calendar year. Since Medicare Parts A & B don't have an out-of-pocket maximum, your out-of-pocket medical expenses could add up to hundreds or thousands per year. Medicare Supplement plans are designed to help cover some of these costs. Your health needs and budget will help you decide which Medicare Supplement plan might be best for you.
