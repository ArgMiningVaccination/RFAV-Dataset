[Watch this segment in Episode 83](http://www.cbc.ca/video/#/Shows/Steven_and_Chris/Full_Episodes/Season_2/ID=1237706503). 1. Berries (blueberries and cranberries) - What makes berries beautiful, are plant pigments called anthocyanidins. These compounds give berries their characteristic rich red, purple and blue colour. - Cranberries contain compounds that address three issues common in aging: gum disease, urinary tract infections (the most common infection in women 50+), and high cholesterol. - Cranberry supplement option: \"Cran-Max\" by Swiss Herbal Remedies - Blueberries contain many vital nutrients that fight aging. Blueberries boost brain function (improve memory and motor skills), stabilize collagen (foundation for skin and tissues) and support the health of our blood vessels. 2. Broccoli - A member of the cabbage family broccoli contains compounds (sulphoraphane and indole-3-carbinol) that neutralize free radicals and enhance detoxification. - Consumption of cruciferous vegetables, such as broccoli, is known to reduce the risk of a number of cancers, especially lung, colon, breast, ovarian and bladder cancer. - Studies on indole-3-carbinol (I3C) show that it can reverse precancerous cervical lesions. - Research conducted at John's Hopkins University found that sulforaphane can help repair sun-damaged skin. - Supplement option: \"Breast Health\" by femMED contains indole-3-carbinol and other nutrients that help promote healthy estrogen balance. 3. Chia - Chia is a tiny seed grown in south and central America. - One of the hottest superfoods because it contains the highest amount of omega-3 fatty acids of all plants (omega-3s are good for our brain, heart and skin). - Chia is naturally low in the glycemic index, helps improve blood sugar control (reduce risk of diabetes), curbs appetite and provides sustained energy - a great food to boost energy. - Chia also provides a range of vital antioxidants, minerals and fiber. - Look for \"Chia Nutra\" by Webber Naturals 4. Garlic - One of the most widely studied foods, garlic helps protect against many age-related diseases. - It lowers risk factors for heart disease (lowers cholesterol, prevents plaque in vessels, lowers blood pressure), it boosts immune system function and it aids in detoxification (helps us rid our bodies of potential carcinogens). - The beneficial effects are attributed to its sulfur compounds, selenium, vitamin C and other antioxidants - Supplement option: \"Kyolic aged garlic extract\" an odorless and clinically studied form of garlic. 5. Green Tea - Everyone knows that green tea is good to health. There are thousands of studies demonstrating that it is good for the heart, helps fight cancer and supports weight loss. - Recent studies have revealed some other anti-aging benefits: green tea can fight off Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease by protecting the brain and nerve cells from damage and death. - Green tea contains an amino acid L-theanine that has a calming effect. Studies of the supplement form of L-theanine (Suntheanine) show that it can reduce stress and promote relaxation, while boosting mental focus, concentration and memory. 6. Red Wine (and grapes) - Wine has long been touted as an anti-aging beverage and with good reason, studies have shown that it can fight off age-related diseases, such as heart disease and stroke (prevents clots, lowers cholesterol and blood pressure, reduces inflammation and improves circuation). - Interest in red wine escalated when research showed the French to have a longer lifespan than North Americans despite consuming a diet rich in saturated fats. - It was found that red wine, a staple of the French diet, acts as a protective agent against the saturated fat's harmful effects. This phenomenon is referred to as \"The French Paradox\" - Health benefits of red wine are attributed to resveratrol and quercitin. - Look for \"Antioxidant Red\" by Herbal Magic. This product contains resveratrol along with ellagic acid from pomegranate and alpha lipoic acid. One capsule is equivalent to 75 glasses of wine! 7. Tomatoes - Contain a compound called lycopene. - Studies show that lycopene can reduce the risk of prostate and colon cancer, reduce blood pressure and heart attack risk. - New research has revealed that lycopene and other tomato compounds can reduce oxidative damage to the skin from sun exposure, thus providing some natural SPF and helping to fight off sun-damage and premature skin aging. - Look for supplements that contain \"Lyc-O-Mato\", a clinically studied tomato complex that contains lycopene and other antioxidants naturally present in tomatoes.
