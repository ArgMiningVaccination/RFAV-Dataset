Triphala Triphala is a combination of amla, baheda, and haritaki in equal proportions.

Foods That Weaken The Immune System 1. Caffeinated Drinks Though caffeine in moderation can benefit your immunity, too much intake of caffeine can lower the ability of your immune system to fight against infections and to eliminate the damaged or abnormal cells from your body. High caffeine consumption through coffees and soft drinks can result in weight gain, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and triglyceride levels, acne accompanied by immunity suppression. 2. Sugary Foods And Drinks Consuming excessive sugar can put the white blood cells (immunity cells) in your body to a temporary coma, which may last for several hours after consumption. So, if you are having sugary foods and drinks several times a day, then it takes a toll on the normal functioning of your immune system. In food industries, the combination of table sugar and high-fructose corn syrup(HFCS) is a primary choice of sweetener as it has better palatability, shelf-life, and competitive price. And, this resulted in an additional 30% increase in processed sugar consumption, making it more difficult for our body to regulate blood glucose levels. 3. Processed Foods Processed and baked foods [ [5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4074336/)] trigger the growth of wrong bacteria and yeast in your gut, disrupting its natural microbiome. Also, the unhealthy fats in processed foods activate inflammation in your body tissues, which impairs the functionalities of your immune system. 4. Refined Carbohydrates The whole food complex carbohydrates are processed and stripped of their nutrients to produce refined carbohydrates such as white rice, white sugar, refined flours from grains, etc. These carbs are converted into glucose easily and rapidly, which in turn cause an unbalanced gut microbiome. Consuming refined carbohydrates regularly leads to chronic ailments such as diabetes, cancer, heart disease, kidney disease, retinopathy, neuropathy, digestive disorders, etc. 5. Alcoholic Beverages Consuming alcohol kills healthy gut bacteria, which helps in controlling infections. Also, it triggers inflammation in your gut and intestines, which in turn compromise your immunity. Alcohol has adverse effects on all types of immune cells throughout your body. Ayurvedic Diet & Immunity Tips The rules of the diet are as important as the foods chosen. A. Move your bowels regularly. If you are not regular, use triphala, warm honey, and lemon water B.
