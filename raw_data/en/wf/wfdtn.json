Read the package and make sure it's quick-cooking \"pearled\" barley. Ingredients - 3 cups fresh mushrooms, any variety - 2 tsp olive oil - 1 cup chopped onion - 1 cup quick barley - 4 cups vegetable broth - 2 cups water - 1 (14.5-ounce) can petite diced tomatoes - 1 carrot - 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley or other herb Directions Brush mushrooms to remove any soil that may be clinging to them. Rinse under cool water and drain. Trim stems and cut into bite-sized pieces, remembering that mushrooms shrink when cooked. Heat olive oil in a large soup pot over medium-high heat. Add onion and mushrooms. Stir until onions are tender and translucent and mushrooms give up their moisture. Add barley, broth, water, and tomatoes. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 15 minutes or until barley is tender. Turn off heat. Use a vegetable peeler to put thin strips of carrot into soup. Add parsley. Serve immediately.
