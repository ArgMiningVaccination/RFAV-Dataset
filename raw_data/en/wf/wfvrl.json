You can also schedule a consult with our integrative nurse, if you like, to make sure you're taking the right supplements for your health & wellness goals. We will also be curating other high-quality health and wellness products that support the care we offer at our center and that we think you will enjoy. Our store is open to everyone, not just clients. Feel free to share with friends! Why do supplements matter? Supplements are natural ingredients that support your physical and mental health. Supplements can be very helpful for sleep, stress, anxiety, mood, energy, gut health, immune system support, and more. We tell you which supplements we recommend the most and how to use them. Be aware that although supplements are generally safe and non-toxic, it is recommended to consult a trained professional before beginning a supplement regimen to ensure the supplement is a good fit for your specific situation and goals. Why buy through us? You'd be surprised how many supplements on store shelves don't have the amount of the therapeutic ingredient that they claim, or are full of unhealthy fillers! After all, there is no government body that tests and certifies supplements and supplements are not FDA-regulated. The supplements we recommend through Fullscript, however, are therapeutic-grade, of the highest quality, and reviewed by our wellness team. Create you own supplements account under our wellness center account and you'll be able to see the specific brands and supplements we recommend for specific purposes! You can then order them to have them shipped right to your door! Fullscript offers the highest quality supplements, and we curate a subset of their catalog of supplements that we recommend the most. You may not find these brands and supplements in stores as they are therapeutic grade, lab-tested, certified, and used by healthcare professionals. In cases where you do find these in a store, you'll notice that our pricing is similar to retail pricing anywhere for the same supplements, but you get the added benefit of our explanations of how use each supplement and education on the issues you are trying to resolve. Thank you for ordering from us, and please share this resource with your friends and family! Sincerely, the Presence Wellness team Supplements we often recommend include Vitamin D, Omega 3s, B-vitamins, and magnesium. You'll get the full list once you log in.
