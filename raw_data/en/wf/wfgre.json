Kalra 1, V. C2, A. Bakshi2, G. Mandhani1, A. Mahajan1 1Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Delhi, India; 2Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, Pediatrics, Delhi, India Background/Objectives: Both ketaminemidazolam and propofol are frequently used in pediatriconcology units for procedural sedation. However, there are no prospective, randomized comparative trials (RCT) comparing them. This is especially important for developing countries where due to limited resources; nonanesthesiologists (trained pediatricians) usually perform the procedural sedation. Objective is to compare ketamine+midazolam (Group A) and propofol (Group B) as sedative agents for intrathecal chemotherapy. Design/Methods: A partiallyblinded, RCT was conducted between July 2015February 2017 after institutional ethics approval. Children aged 112 years requiring intravenous sedation for intrathecal chemotherapy were included. Patients were randomized using computer generated randomization tables after obtaining written consent. Initial doses used were, ketamine at 2mg/kg, midazolam at 0.2 mg/kg and propofol at 2.5mg/kg as per standard recommendations. Time to sedation, dose required, depth of sedation (using Modified Ramsey scale), vital parameters, time and smoothness of recovery and emergence phenomenon were documented. Results: A total of 152 patients were enrolled (Group A: 76, Group B: 76). Nine patients had failure of sedation (all in Group B). Thirteen in group A and 51 ingroup B required top up sedation. Mean time to sedation ingroup B was shorter (p=0.000). Mean heart rate ingroup A was higher (p=0.000). Transient drop in saturation was noted in 10 patients ingroup A and in 20 ingroup B (p=0.174). Mean depth of sedation ingroup A was greater than ingroup B (p=0.000). Mean time to recovery ingroup B was shorter than ingroup A (p=0.000). Emergence symptoms were experienced by 38 patients ingroup A and 7 ingroup B (p=0.000). Conclusions: KetamineMidazolam combination appears to be safer and more effective when used by nonanaesthesiologists. Propofol has a significantly faster onset, quicker recovery, smoother emergence from sedation, but at the recommended initial doses it provides inadequate sedation.

AHOPCA, a collaborative group in Central America, implemented a modified BFMbased treatment regimen. Design/Methods: Newly diagnosed patients with histologically or immunocytological diagnosis of mature Bcell malignancies diagnosed between 03/2004 and 06/2016 at 6 institutions. reatment: Murphy's Stages III, prephase and blocks A, B, A (methotrexate dose 1 g/m2 in 3 hour infusion); Stage III, prephase and blocks A,B,A,B,A,B; Stage IV, prephase and blocks A,B,A,B,A,B (methotrexate dose 3 g/m2 in 3 hour infusion). Patients in poor clinical conditions during induction were given a second prephase before proceeding with Blocks A or AA. Poor responders to the first 2 cycles were given AA and BB blocks for the remaining cycles. Ifosfamide dose was 400 mg/m2 in blocks A or AA. Difficult cases were discussed at Cure4kids.org. Results: With a median followup of 49 months, 405 patients were registered (386 eligible). Four patients with HIV, eight previously treated, three cases with wrong diagnosis and three cases treated with another treatment protocol were excluded.177 cases had immunohistochemical characterization. Distribution was Stages III, 30; III, 248; IV, 99; NA, 9. The 3year overall survival was 70% for the whole group (86% for stages III, 75% for stage III and 58% for stage IVBALL). Events included: Death on induction (n=32), abandonment (n=23), relapse/progression (n=23), death in complete remission (n=9), second malignancy (n=1) and death of unknown cause (n=1). Conclusions: This simplified adapted treatment is feasible and associated with acceptable results in settings with limited resources. Efforts to improve results should focus on educating the community providers about the early signs of the disease and prompt referral. Improving histologic techniques is critical to decrease the number of wrong diagnosis and allow proper classification.

We mapped the site, timing and mode of detection of first WT relapse using the SIOP WT 2001 study database and assessed prognostic factors for postrelapse mortality. Data were used to evaluate current surveillance recommendations. Design/Methods: All patients with WTs registered (20012016) in the SIOP WT 2001 study and treated with preoperative chemotherapy as per protocol were included in the analyses. Results: Of 4348 registered patients, 538 (12%) relapsed. Relapse site involved lung (65%) and/or abdomen (49%), liver (11%), bone (1%) and central nervous system (1%). Most relapses (80%) occurred within 2 years postsurgery, with highrisk histology tumours relapsing faster (89% by 2y). Postrelapse overall 5year survival rate was 61% (95% CI: 57%66%). Surveillance imaging captured 78% of the relapses and the remaining relapses presented with clinical symptoms 'outside' of routine followup. Relapse was identified by abdominal ultrasound (32%), chest Xray (30%), CT scan of chest/abdomen (23%/7%), abdominal MRI (4%) or other (4%). The majority (69%) of relapses were not detectable by medical examination and only 33% of relapses were accompanied by symptoms. In multivariable analyses, overall survival after relapse was statistically significantly (P < 0.05) poorer for; surgery to relapse interval < 6 months, symptomatic presentation 'outside' planned followup, higher tumour volume at initial surgery, and advanced stage/histological risk group. Conclusions: WT relapses predominantly involve the lung and generally occur within 2 years of nephrectomy and without symptoms. Routine surveillance imaging captured the majority of relapses and these patients seemed to have better postrelapse survival. In the absence of prospective trials, our evidence indicates that current recommendations for imaging followup intervals are effective and duration should focus on the first 23 years after nephrectomy.

AW-04 Perinatal and Familial Risk Factors for SoftTissue Sarcomas in Children, Adolescents, and Young Adults: A PopulationBased Birth Cohort Study, Sweden, 19732012 P. Lupo 1, R. B. Tavelin2, M. Scheurer1, B. Melin2, Papworth2 1Baylor College of Medicine, Pediatrics, USA; 2Ume\u00e5 University, Radiation Sciences, Ume\u00e5, Sweden Background/Objectives: Perinatal factors have been associated with softtissue sarcomas (STS) in casecontrol studies. However, (1) the specific contributions of factors including fetal growth remain unknown, (2) these factors have not been examined in large cohort studies, and (3) few assessments have evaluated risk in specific STS subtypes. Therefore, we sought to identify the role of perinatal and familial factors on the risk of STS in a large populationbased birth cohort. Design/Methods: We identified 5,063,499 individuals in the Swedish Birth Registry born during 19732012. Subjects were linked to the Swedish Cancer Registry, where incident STS cases were identified. We evaluated perinatal and familial factors obtained from Statistics Sweden, including: fetal growth, gestational age, presence of a congenital anomaly, and parental age. Poisson regression was used to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations between selected factors and STS overall, as well as by common subtypes. Results: There were 673 children, adolescents, and young adults diagnosed with STS in 77.5 million personyears of followup. Having a congenital anomaly was associated with STS risk association was 1.256.70) in more recent years (20002012). High fetal growth was also associated with STS during the same time period (IRR=1.87, 95% CI: 1.063.30). Being born CI: 1.014.04). Notably, advanced paternal age (>35 years) was inversely associated with the risk of developing synovial sarcoma (IRR=0.50, 95% CI: 0.260.94). Conclusions: In this cohort study, those with congenital anomalies and other adverse birth outcomes were more likely to develop a STS compared to their unaffected contemporaries. These associations may point to disrupted developmental pathways influencing the risk of STS. Our findings could implicate novel mechanisms underlying susceptibility to STS and may inform future surveillance, prevention, and treatment efforts. AW-05 A Geography of Clones: Mapping Somatic Mutations Over Anatomic Space in Children with Cancer D. Gisselsson 1, J. Karlsson1, A. Valind1, C. Jansson1 1Laboratory medicine Lund, Clinical Genetics, Lund, Sweden Background/Objectives: To chart genetic intratumour diversity in childhood cancer over multiple anatomic locations and/or time points during treatment in order to (1) delineate common routes of cancer cell evolution, (2) reveal candidate mechanisms behind treatment resistance, and (3) gain information on intrapatient variability of clinical biomarkers. Design/Methods: Patients were included based on the availability of two or more informative samples from the primary tumour, taken with a minimum intersample distance of 10 mm. A total of 54 patients with neuroblastoma (n=24), Wilms tumour (n=20) or sarcoma (n=10) been subjected to multiregional analysis of tumour tissue with high resolution whole genome genotyping arrays (all patients) complemented in selected cases by whole exome sequencing, targeted deep DNA sequencing, and RNA sequencing. Between two and 20 tumour samples were analyzed per patient with a total of 230 informative tumour samples genotyped so far. Results: The majority of cases exhibited intratumour genetic diversity with branching evolution, including variability of several suggested clinical biomarkers. Subclones were the major arena of genome evolution in most primary tumors. There were clear features of convergent evolution, including trisomies and monosomies of whole chromosomes as well as specific somatic gene alterations such as TP53 mutation in Wilms tumors, CDKN2A/B deletion in neuroblastoma, and amplification in rhabdomyosarcoma. Genetic patterns unique to anatomic subcompartments in individual patients had functional consequences for gene expression at the RNA and protein levels. Four general patterns of tumour evolution were identified of which at least one strongly correlated to clinically aggressive. Conclusions: Even in very young patients, highrisk cancer is a genetically dynamic disease over space and time. Intratumour genetic diversity is common and is a significant source of error in biomarker assessment. Certain evolutionary patterns may be useful as future clinical predictors. AW-06 CRISPR/CAS9 Based Reverse Genetics Identifies Therapeutic Targets to Improve Therapy Response in Paediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia M. Butler 1, L. van der Meer1, J. Yu2,3, T. Beeby1, R. Kuiper2,3, F. 2Princess M\u00e1xima Pediatric Netherlands; 3Radboud university medical center and Radboud Insitute for Molecular Life Sciences, Department of Human Genetics, Nijmegen, The Netherlands Background/Objectives: The genomic characterization of 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia' (ALL) has greatly improved the recognition of patients with a high relapse risk. Despite the success of intensified treatment for 'highrisk' patients, relapse and associated therapy resistance remain a significant problem. In this study we aimed to identify therapeutic targets that synergize with standardofcare drugs in treating ALL. Design/Methods: We used a CRISPR/Cas9 based lossoffunction screen to identify novel genes that control tumor cell sensitivity towards prednisolone and asparaginase, key components of current ALL treatment protocols. To facilitate rapid translation to clinical practice, we focused our screen on kinases, as potential candidates for pharmacological inhibition. Results were validated using targeted knockout and smallmolecule inhibitors. Results: The CRISPR/Cas9 based screen has identified genes that modulate sensitivity towards the tested drugs, both inducing resistance as well as enhancing the susceptibility towards drug induced apoptosis. The antitumor effects of asparaginase treatment impinge on changes in cell metabolism as a result of amino acid starvation. Consistent with this notion, we found genes either directly involved in the amino acid response route (TRIB3) or aminoacid metabolism (GCN2). Indeed, targeted knockout of GCN2 sensitizes cells to asparaginase treatment whereas depletion of TRIB3 was sufficient to render these cells more resistant. Surprisingly, sensitivity for prednisolone was controlled by kinases involved in Tolllike receptor signaling and betaadrenergic receptor signaling. Consistent with these findings, the use of clinically approved compounds that modulate these pathways dramatically potentiate the antitumor effect of prednisolone. betaadrenergic receptorincreased sensitivity to prednisolone mediated apoptosis up to 30 fold. Conclusions: We conclude from these results that our CRISPR/Cas9 based screens can be used to (i) delineate pathways that contribute therapy resistance and (ii) identify targets that can be selectively inhibited to improve therapy response. AW-07 Pseudoprogression in Pediatric LowGrade Glioma After Radiation Therapy 1, E.S. Memphis TN, USA; 2Department of Radiation Oncology, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland OH, USA; 3Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Boston MA, USA; 4Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, School of Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (NKUA), Athens, Greece Background/Objectives: This goal of this study was to report the incidence, management and risk factors for pseudoprogression after radiation therapy (RT) in patients with pediatric lowgrade glioma (LGG). Design/Methods: This retrospective study included patients aged 21 years with intracranial LGG treated with curativeintent RT at a single institution. Pseudoprogression was defined as an increase in tumour size by 10% in at least 2 dimensions between two or three consecutive MR imaging studies. Overall survival (OS) and eventfree survival (EFS) were measured from the first day of RT. EFS was defined as survival without true progression or secondary highgrade glioma. Results: Sixtytwo of 221 patients developed pseudoprogression, 10year cumulative incidence of 29.0% (95% CI 23.035.2). Median time to pseudoprogression was 6.1 after RT (interquartile range [IQR] 3.514.6). 68% of tumours with pseudoprogression were observed, with eventual stabilization (48%) or reduction in size (20%) over time. Symptomatic pseudoprogression was managed with subtotal resection, shunt/Ommaya reservoir placement, or corticosteroids in 11 (18%), 7 (11%), and 2 patients (3%), respectively. Patients with pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) had 5.4fold greater odds of developing pseudoprogression relative to other tumours (odds ratio 95% CI 2.5-11.4, P < 0.0001). Among 127 patients with PA, the 10year cumulative incidence of pseudoprogression was 42.9%. In this subgroup, pseudoprogression was associated with improved 10year EFS (84.5% vs. 58.5%, P = 0.008) and OS (98.0% vs. 91.2%, P = 0.03). Conclusion: Pseudoprogression after radiation therapy was common, particularly in patients with pilocytic astrocytoma, and was associated with improved survival. Awareness of the incidence and temporal dynamics of pseudoprogression may help avoid unnecessary salvage treatments. AW-08 Mutations in CIC, DMD and PHOX2B Activate the RASMAPK Pathway in Neuroblastoma and Activation of this Pathway Causes Tumor Progression T.F. Childhood Oncology, Utrecht, the Netherlands; 2Department of Oncogenomics, Academic Medical Center of the University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands; 3Department of Pediatric Oncology, Emma Childrens Hospital, Academic Medical Center of the University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands Background/Objectives: It was recently shown that mutations affecting the RASMAPK pathway occur frequently in neuroblastoma relapse tumors. We hypothesized that activation of this pathway could be associated with poor prognosis and tumor progression. Hence the objectives were to detect the activation state of the RASMAPK pathway in tumors, correlate this to prognosis, and find and characterize additional mutations that can serve as biomarkers for pathway activation. Design/Methods: We generated a gene signature that can identify the activation state of the RASMAPK pathway in cell lines and tumors. These data were correlated to Whole Genome Sequencing data to identify novel mutations that influence activation of this pathway. Candidate mutations were induced in cell lines using gene editing and characterized both in vitro and in vivo. Results: We show that in primary neuroblastoma tumors activation of the RASMAPK pathway correlates with poor survival, and is associated with known activating mutations in ALK and other bona fide RASMAPK pathway genes. From integrative analysis, we identify mutations in PHOX2B, CIC and DMD that activate the RASMAPK pathway in vitro and we show that activation of this pathway causes tumor progression in vivo. Conclusion: These results identify novel biomarkers of RASMAPK activation and reinforce this pathway as a promising target in high risk neuroblastoma. Further research should determine whether the identified mutations also function as biomarkers for sensitivity to MEK inhibition. Free Paper Session: Solid Tumours Biology O-001 HighlyAccumulated HIF1 is a Potential Therapeutic Target in the Treatment of Wilms Tumor M. Nelson 1, Y. Liu1, C. Bailey1, Y. Liu1, J. Dome1, Y. Wang1 1Children's National Medical Center, Center for Cancer and Immunology Research, Washington DC, USA Background/Objectives: Fiveyear survival of patients with Wilms tumor (WT) is However, anaplastic patients with favorable histology WT (FHWT) will suffer recurrence. Patients who survive with additional therapy are at risk for toxicities such as infertility. Hypoxiainducible factor 1 (HIF1) is upregulated in a number of malignancies and implicated in chemoresistance and recurrence. We investigate the prevalence of HIF1 accumulation, its role in WT growth, and response to treatment with echinomycin, a known HIF1 inhibitor, in preclinical WT models. staining for HIF1 was performed on 64 WT samples, which were scored on a scale according to percentage of cells positively stained. HIF1 was knockedout in the WiT49 cell line (WiT49HIF1ko) employing the CRISPR/Cas9 system and tumor growth in NSG mice was compared to WiT49wild type (WiT49wt). The effect of echinomycin on viability was assessed in three patientderived WT cell lines, including two AHWT samples, using the MTT assay. The effect of liposomal echinomycin (LipoE) on tumor was assessed in a patientderived AHWT xenograft model. Results: Fifty percent of WT samples (n=32) had the highest HIF 1 staining intensity score of 3 (>50% of cells staining positively). Mice injected WiT49wt cells resulted in tumors with incidence of 100%, while no tumors grew from injected WiT49HIF1ko cells (P<0.001). Echinomycin was toxic against WiT49 and all three exvivo WT cases in cell culture (IC50 at 1350 pM). AHWT xenografts treated with LipoE showed significant growth inhibition compared to vehicle (P=0.04). Conclusions: HIF1 is prevalent in WT samples and its presence is essential for tumor growth in mice. Echinomycin treatment of AHWT xenografts impairs tumor growth. Therefore, echinomycin holds promise as a targeted agent against WT. O-002 Insights from the Evolutionary Trajectories of Wilms Tumor G. Cresswell 1, T. Chagtai2, Laboratory, London, United Kingdom; 2UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, Developmental Biology and Cancer, London, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: We previously demonstrated intratumor genetic heterogeneity in multisampled Wilms tumors (WT), which occurs despite a low number of genetic changes per tumor. Frequent multifocality or bilaterality are significant treatment challenges with poorly understood mechanisms. Furthermore, only circa 50% of relapses can be predicted with current stratification criteria. To address these issues, we need to understand better the evolutionary processes of WT development. Current experimental approaches to tumor evolution utilise wholegenome/exome (WGS/WES) sequencing in multisampled tumors, but WGS/WES may not be an efficient approach in tumors with relatively few mutations. Design/Methods: We combined targeted sequencing profiles and mutational status in a panel of 181 genes. We developed a mixture modelbased method to model Ballele frequencies and infer cellularities of copynumber aberration (CNA) segments. We inferred persample subclones by clustering segments with similar cellularities; subclones were compared across multiple samples, and an evolutionary trajectory was calculated for each tumor. Combined SNP array and sequencing data were available for 32 multisampled WTs, and SNP array data only for an additional 30 WTs. Results: We inferred 110 clones per WT, showing a wide range of evolutionary trajectories. A subset of cases show marked evolutionary divergence, and this may explain diagnostic difficulty in diffuse anaplasia. Another subset show striking convergent evolution for CNAs and point mutations. Conclusions: Accurate evolutionary trajectories can be inferred in multisampled WT, regardless of tumor multifocality or bilaterality, and without resourceintensive WGS/WES, despite the low number of passenger as well as driver mutations per tumor. Many tumors show a surprisingly high number of clones/tumor, comparable to adult cancers, and there is a wide range of evolutionary trajectories, generally unlike adult cancers. Cases with convergent evolution suggest a previously unsuspected strong selection pressure in a subset of WT. O-003 Preclinical Rationale for Embryonal Rhabdomyosarcoma N. Bharathy 1 1Children's Cancer Therapy Development Institute, Biotechnology, Beaverton, Usa Background/Objectives: Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common soft tissue sarcoma of childhood yet often also occurs in adolescents and young adults. Clinically, survival amongst metastatic RMS patients has remained dismal yet unimproved for years, if not several decades. We previously identified the class I specific histone deacetylase inhibitor, fusion gene found in many alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas. The purpose of this study is to examine whether entinostat may provide real therapeutic benefit for patients with embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (eRMS) and alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (aRMS). Design/Methods: We investigated the comparative efficacy of entinostat to other HDAC inhibitors for the full spectrum of Pax3:Foxo1/Pax7:Foxo1 positive aRMS and fusion negative eRMS using both in vitro and in vivo models that includes orthotopic allografts and patient derived xenografts. Inaddition, to understand the mechanism of entinostat action in aRMS and eRMS; RNAseq, ChIPexo, and CRISPR studies were carried out. Results: We find that entinostat most effectively silences Pax3:Foxo1. Entinostat delays tumor engraftment in aRMS after radiation treatment. In combination with the chemotherapy vincristine, entinostat has strong antitumor activity in CRISPR studies suggest that HDAC3 inhibition is the primary mechanism of Pax3:Foxo1 downregulation in aRMS and cellautonomous cytoreduction in eRMS, but that the myogenic differentiation effect of chemotherapyentinostat therapy in eRMS is driven by crosstalk with the tumor microenvironment. Conclusions: These studies support the emerging clinical trial concepts for the use of entinostat with chemotherapy for aRMS and eRMS. It addresses the clinical need with preclinical evidence that suggests entinostat, may provide therapeutic benefit in RMS. We present both in vitro and in vivo evidence to not only document entinostat's therapeutic effect on RMS tumors, but also to understand the mechanism underlying its activity in both aRMS and eRMS. O-004 Integrated Genetic and Epigenetic Analysis Defines Novel Molecular Subgroups in Hepatoblastoma E. Hiyama 1, S. Kurihara1, S. HIrano2, Hospital, Peditric Surgery, Hiroshima, Japan; 2Hiroshima University, Natural Science Center for Basic Research and Development, Hiroshima, Japan Background/Objectives: Hepatoblastoma (HB) is the most prevalent liver malignancies and its molecular pathogenesis is incompletely understood. HB incidence is significantly high in the children with extremely lowbirth weight and some HB patients diagnosed at old ages showed poor outcomes. Design/Methods: Here we describe an integrated molecular study in which we performed exome, transcriptome and, as well as arraybased copy number and methylation analyses in a total 130 HBL cases. Among them, we also performed wholegenome sequence (WGS) and wholegenome methylation (WGM) analysis in the 30 and 12 cases. Results: Exome and WGS analysis revealed that HB tumors have the few mutations. Younger patients showed the fewer somatic mutations but there are no difference of mutation rates between the patients with lowbirth weight and those with normal birth weight. The mutation signatures revealed two characteristic patterns. Most dominant alterations were CTNNB1 exon 3 and other mutation of Wnt signal genes including AXIN1 and FAP genes. However, RNA sequencing did not showed the activation of Wnt signaling genes. Some cases showed the mutations of ARID1A, KCNN3, and MLL2, but the number of these mutations were less than 10. Based on methylation patterns, HBL is clustered into four distinct subtypes named C14. C1 showed the similar pattern of noncancerous liver tissues and C2 was highly correlated with 11p UPD. Interestingly, no cases with extreme lowbirth weight exhibited 11pUPD.C3 and C4 involved the cases diagnosed at older age. All C3 cases were alive but more than half of C4 cases showed poor outcomes. Conclusions: This integrated molecular analysis unmasked new correlations between DNA methylation including UPD, gene mutations, gene expression and copy number profiles, enabling the stratification of clinical risks for patients with HB. Molecular analysis provides new important clusters of the HB patients to be stratified in future clinical trials. Free Paper Session: Epidemiology I O-005 Maternal use of Hormonal Contraceptives and Risk of Childhood Leukaemia - A Nationwide PopulationBased Cohort Study Genes, Copenhagen, Denmark; 2Danish Cancer Society, Childhood Cancer Survivorship Copenhagen, Denmark; 3Copenhagen University Paediatric and Adolescent Medicine, Copenhagen Denmark, Denmark Background/Objectives: Following the discovery, that diethylstilboestrol (i.e. a synthetic oestrogen) can cause cancer in children exposed in utero, few casecontrol studies have investigated the effect of maternal contraceptive use on the risk of cancer in children, and with inconsistent results. The aim of this study was to assess the association between maternal use of hormonal contraceptives and childhood leukaemia, using the unique Danish registries. Design/Methods: We followed a nationwide cohort of 1,185,157 live born children between 1996 and 2014 through individual linkage to Danish registries. Redeemed prescription data from the National Register of Medicinal Product Statistics provided information on maternal hormonal contraceptive use, categorized as: never before birth (reference), > 3 months prior to conception and < 3 months before conception to birth (that is, recent use). Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) adjusted for potential confounders. Results: During 11,028,171 personyears of observation (mean: 9.4 years), 598 children were diagnosed with leukaemia. An increased risk of leukaemia was found in children born to women with a recent use of any type of hormonal contraception (HR: 1.48; 95% CI: 1.102.00) compared to children of never users. Specifically for nonlymphatic leukaemia, the risk was more than doubled (HR: 2.41; 95% CI: 1.324.38). The increase was mainly observed for recent use of combined products (progestin/oestrogen combined), both for any type of Conclusions: Maternal use of hormonal contraception up to or in early pregnancy may increase the risk of leukaemia in children. O-006 Trends in Childhood Cancer Incidence and Survival in Japan and England K. Nakata 1,2,3, Y. Ito1, W. Magadi2, A. Bonaventure2, K. PritchardJones3, B. Rachet2 1Osaka International Cancer Center, Cancer Control Center, Osaka, Japan; 2London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, Cancer Survival Group, London, United Kingdom; 3UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, Developmental Biology and Cancer Programme, London, United Kingdom; 4Public Health England, National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service, Oxford, United Kingdom; 5Center for Cancer Control & Information Services National Cancer Center, Center for Cancer Registries, Tokyo, Japan Background/Objectives: This study aimed to compare the time trends in cancer incidence and survival for children diagnosed in Japan and England, using populationbased cancer registry data. Design/Methods: The analysis was based on 5,192 children with cancer (age 014) from 6 prefectural cancer registries in Japan and 21,295 children diagnosed in England, during 19932010. Agestandardised incidence rates (ASRs) were calculated using weights of the world standard population. Poisson regression models were used to evaluate changes in incidence rates over time. Overall 1year, 5year and 10year survival was estimated using the KaplanMeier method. Results: Incidence of all childhood cancers combined has decreased in Japan throughout 19932010 (ASR 19931998: 127 per million personyears vs 20052010:116), which was mainly explained by a decrease in registration of infant neuroblastoma. Incidence for all cancers in England increased between 19931998 and 19992004, then plateaued (ASR 19931998:129, 19992004: 133, for Hodgkin lymphoma, renal tumours, and Ewing sarcomas in England were more than twice as high as those in Japan. Incidence of germ cell tumours, hepatic tumours, neuroblastoma, acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) was higher in Japan than in England. For many cancers, 5year survival improved in both countries and the differences in survival between countries narrowed over time. The improvement in survival in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) was particularly dramatic in both countries. However, 5year survival remained less than 80% in both countries for AML, brain tumours, soft tissue sarcomas, malignant bone tumours, and neuroblastoma in children aged 114 years. Conclusions: There were significant differences in incidence of several cancers between England and Japan, suggesting ethnic variation in susceptibility. The decrease in incidence in infant neuroblastoma in Japan coincided with cessation of the national screening programme. The great improvement in survival from CML in both countries coincided with the introduction of effective therapy (imatinib). O-007 Parental Socioeconomic Factors Influencing Childhood Cancer Mortality in Finland: A Nationwide RegisterBased Study A. Tolkkinen 1, J. Taskinen3, L. MadanatHarjuoja1,4, M. Rantanen1, N. Malila1,5 1Finnish Cancer Registry, Finnish Cancer Registry, Helsinki, Finland; 2University of Helsinki, Department of Public Health, Helsinki, Finland; 3Helsinki University Hospital, Division of Pediatric Hematology Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Helsinki, Finland; 4Helsinki University Hospital, Department of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, Helsinki, Finland; 5University of Tampere, School of Health Science, Tampere, Finland Background/Objectives: Parental socioeconomic status has been suggested to have an influence on childhood cancer mortality even in highincome countries. Our study investigated if parental socioeconomic factors influence childhood cancer mortality in Finland. Design/Methods: Using nationwide populationbased registries we identified 4,437 patients diagnosed with cancer under the age of 20 from 1990 to 2009. The outcome was death from primary cancer in 10 years followup. Identification of parents and information on socioeconomic factors were retrieved from the central population registry and Statistics Finland. Poisson regression models were adjusted for followup time, age at cancer diagnosis and diagnostic period. Results: Mortality was lower in the highest quartile of combined parental disposable income (HR 0.72, CI 95% 0.550.93) compared to the lowest quartile. After adding parental education to the model, the result was still statistically significant. Compared to individuals with Finnish decent, mortality was higher if the patient (n=58, HR 2.18, CI 95 % 1.383.44), the mother (n=113, HR 2.29, CI 95 % 1.663.16) or the father (n=121, HR 2.04, CI 95 % 1.472.82) was an immigrant and born aboard. Mortality was also higher if the maternal (n=115, HR 2.35, CI 95 % 1.713.23) or paternal native language (n=119, HR 2.16, CI 95 % 1.572.98) was other than Finnish or Swedish. The results for origin of birth and native language remained significant in the 5year followup even after adjusting for parental income, employment status and education. Conclusions: In Finland, despite public health care and comprehensive social security, high parental income predicted lower mortality after childhood cancer compared to those with low parental income. Parental immigrant status and being born abroad were predictors of increased mortality. Underlying factors related to patient pathways should be explored to better understand and prevent these disparities in the future. O-008 Pathways of Care for Adolescent and Young Adult Patients with Cancer Diagnosed in 2012 or 2013 in France E. Desandes 1, L. Brugieres2, J. Clavel3, A. Toulouse, France Background/Objectives: In France, as in other countries, there is a need for a populationbased view of access to care and modalities of treatment for adolescents and young adults (AYA) with cancer. The aim is to evaluate their pathway and quality of care in general population settings. Design/Methods: All AYA cases diagnosed with cancer in 20122013, aged from 15 to 24 years, and living in 19 French administrative areas (covering rate:23%) were identified by the French cancer registries. Data on diagnosis and treatment delays, management with multidisciplinary decisional approach (MDT), and pathways of care were collected in medical records. Results: Overall, 412 adolescents and 581 young adults were included. Time to diagnosis was significantly longer for young adults than for adolescents (10 weeks [423] vs 8 weeks [321], Pvalue =0.03), especially for softtissue sarcomas (P=0.02). Decisions for treatment initiation were made within the context of MDT in 86% of adolescents and in 85% of young adults, and 23% of the MDT meetings for adolescents involved both pediatric and adult oncologists (vs. 10% for young adults). Most of AYA cases (67%) consulted general practitioner before referral to a specialist for investigation. The main institutions involved in the management of AYA with cancer were: University hospitals (56%), and private hospitals (26%). The main services were adult oncology units (84%), while 21% of adolescents and 10% of young adults with cancer were cared in dedicated AYA units. Overall, 39.5% of adolescents and 16.8% of young adults were included in clinical studies. Conclusions: Compared to the previous French study (period 200607) [Desandes E et al. 2012], the organization of care for 1519yearold adolescents with cancer shifted toward an increasing involvement of pediatricians (especially for 1517 years), an increasing management within the context of MDT and in specialized cancer health institutions, and an increasing participation in clinical studies. Free Paper Session: Supportive Care O-009 MetaAnalytic Validation of the Picnicc Prediction Model for the Risk of Microbiologically Defined Infection in Febrile Neutropenic Episodes R. Phillips 1, L. Stewart1, C. PICNICC1 1University of York, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, York, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: Risk stratified management of febrile neutropenia (FN), also known as \"fever with neutropenia\", allows intensive management of highrisk cases and early discharge of lowrisk cases. Validation of prediction rules are important, as geographical, temporal and chance variability may affect any derived rule, and calibration is advised. Validating across different data sources allows exploration of the possible reasons for differences and calibrations to be applied. Design/Methods: Using data derived from the \"Predicting Infectious ComplicatioNs In Children with Cancer\" (PICNICC) collaboration, we assessed the value of the PICNICC microbiologically defined infection (MDI) prediction rule in new datasets and combined studylevel data using different randomeffects metaanalysis recalibration and bootstrapping to estimate multivariable risk prediction model has six components: Tumour type, temperature, clinically \"severely unwell\", haemoglobin, white cell count and absolute monocyte count. Results: Seven data sets from six locations, reporting 27648 episodes of fever and neutropenia were included. The raw model overestimated the likelihood of MDI (Expected/Observed ratio 1.49, 95% CI 0.89 to 2.1) with only a moderate Cstatistic 0.59 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.79) compared with 0.72 (95% CI 0.71 to 0.76) in the derivation cohort. The analysis showed marked heterogeneity (Isquared 47% to 56%). Different approaches to metaanalysis led to similar estimates. After recalibration in the large, and assessed at a threshold of 10% to define 'low risk', the model had a pooled sensitivity of 89% (95% CI 72% to 97%) but pooled specificity of only 12% (95% CI 5% to 24%). No clear explanation for heterogeneity was found by assessing inpatient status, continent, or casemix. Conclusions: This metaanalysis of the PICNICC risk prediction model for microbiologically defined infection shows marked variation in validation across multiple data sets. This argues for local validation of any prediction rules before use. O-010 Experience of ChemotherapyInduced Nausea and Vomiting in Children, an Undermanaged Symptom? S. 1,2, Oncology, PARIS, France; 2Trousseau Hospital APHP, Department of Pharmacy, PARIS, France Background/Objectives: Chemotherapyinduced nausea and vomiting (CINV) are toxicities that impact children's quality of life and complicate cancer treatments. Imprecise international recommendations, difficulties in nausea detection in children and the low priority which is sometimes given to this symptom are risks of nonoptimal management of CINV. The purpose of this study was to assess children nausea and vomiting during their chemotherapy treatment. Design/Methods: We conducted a monocentric retrospective survey on children treated in a french paediatric cancers reference center. Patients were asked about their CINV experiences, in terms of frequency, severity and timing of the symptoms. When children could not answer, the questions were asked to their parents. Results: From July to October 2016, 48 children aged from 1 to 17 were surveyed. Twentyfour children had received highly emetogenic chemotherapy, 21 had received moderately emetogenic chemotherapy, and 3 had received low emetogenic chemotherapy. In the overall population analysed, 83% of the patients indicated they had already experienced nausea and/or vomiting during chemotherapy treatments and 40% had experienced it from the first chemotherapy administration. Eight percent of children described anticipatory symptoms, 65% described acute CINV and 54% experienced delayed CINV. Patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy were more exposed to these symptoms (p=0.02): in this population, 100% of children experienced nausea or vomiting during their treatment and 46% of them experienced vomiting systematically or frequently. Conclusions: This study showed that most children experienced CINV during their treatment. These symptoms occurred even if antiemetic prophylaxis were in accordance with local guidelines, but these guidelines were not updated, according to international guidelines. For 30 years, the emetogenic risk in adults with cancer has strongly decreased from 100% to 15%, thanks to therapeutic innovations and CINV management improvements. These improvements are required in paediatrics, and prospects of optimisation exist, starting by convincing and raising awareness among the medical community. O-011 A Longitudinal Study of Pediatric Promis Symptom Clusters in Children Undergoing Chemotherapy S. Jacobs1, J. Wang2, D. Dewalt3, E. Stern1, G. Heather4, National Medical Center, Oncology, Washington, USA; 2Children's National Medical Center, Division of Biostatistics and Study Methodology, Washington, USA; 3University of North Carolina Chapel HIll, Division of General Medicine and Clinical Epidemiology, Chapel HIll NC, USA; 4University of North Carolina Chapel HIll, Sheps Center for Health Services Research, Chapel HIll NC, USA; 5Children's National Medical Center, Department of Nursing Research and Quality Outcomes, Washington, USA Background/Objectives: Children in treatment for cancer experience multiple, troubling and interrelated symptoms. Analyzing the interrelatedness of symptoms and how that might change during treatment is an important focus in cancer symptom research. Applying advanced analytic approaches to this interrelatedness could identify clinically relevant patient profiles. The aims were to identify a) pediatric profiles with respect to fatigue, depression, anxiety and pain, b) changes in profile status throughout a chemotherapy cycle, c) if a baseline fatigue item score could significantly predict symptom profile. Design/Methods: In a longitudinal, singlesite, three data point design, children between 8 and 18 years completed the PROMIS Pediatric short form measures for fatigue, depression, anxiety and pain and a fatigue item from the Symptom Distress Scale. Latent class analysis (LCA) and latent transition analysis (LTA) were applied to the prospective symptom data Results: 96 children participated; 58.3% were between 13 and 18 years and 54.2% were male. The symptom mean scores remained relatively unchanged between the first two data points but significantly declined at the final data point (end of the course of chemotherapy). The LPA results indicated a 2profile model ('Less severe symptoms, 'Severe symptoms). The fatigue score did significantly predict to which profile a child was a member. The LTA findings indicated that only a small proportion of the sample changed profile groups across the three data points. Conclusions: Children experiencing troubling symptoms during cancer treatment are not a homogenous group. The four measured symptoms in this study represent at least two relatively stable profiles that can be identified with high accuracy early in a child's course of chemotherapy, and the transitions in the profile status were significantly predicted by a baseline singleitem fatigue measure. O-012 Seizure in Children with Brain Tumour: A Retrospective Analysis and A Proposal for A Future Study C. Pilotto Udine, Italy; 2University of Nottingham, Children's Brain Tumour Research Centre, Nottingham, United Kingdom; 3University of Nottingham, School of Medicine, Nottingham, United Kingdom; 4Nottingham Children's Hospital, Department of Paediatric Neurology, Nottingham, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: There is no consensus on the treatment and its withdrawal of brain tumour related epilepsies in children and young people. We describe the experience of epileptic seizures in children with brain tumours treated in a neurooncology centre, the related risk factors, the seizure treatments and the withdrawal of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Design/Methods: Retrospective case note review of 120 newly diagnosed brain tumour patients referred between 01/2010 and 12/2014 to the regional paediatric neurooncology service was carried out to determine patient, tumour, seizure characteristics, their treatment and outcomes Results: Data on 117/120 (98%) children and young people were analysed: 67 were male (57%), median age at tumour presentation was 8.1 years (IQR 25\u00b075\u00b0: 3.612.7) with median follow up: experienced seizures. A significant risk factor for seizure occurrence was a cortical tumour location (OR: 7.1 IC 95% 2.917.3). 24 was the median seizure follow up: 15/35 (43%) were seizure free (SF) on AEDs, were SF and off AEDs, and 7/35 (20%) experienced continuing epileptic seizures. 34/35 (97%) were treated with AEDs. 12/34 (35%) patients withdraw AED. The median duration of AED before withdrawal was 11 months (IQR25\u00b075\u00b0 514 months), and the median follow up after withdrawal was 15 months (IQR25\u00b075\u00b0 534 months). 4/34 (12%) had seizure relapse, all after further acute events. Conclusions: We suggest that AEDs are withdrawn after a period of three months seizure freedom, in particular in children with only one acute symptomatic seizure, and an uncomplicated course, without ongoing epileptogenic complications. This time of withdrawal is proposed as a service evaluation target for future studies Acknowledgements: Prof Richard Grundy, Dr Sophie Wilne, EMCYPICS, and Children's Brain Tumour Research (Nottingham) Free Paper Session: Brain Tumours I O-013 ACNS0334: Treatment of Young Children, with Supratentorial PNET (SPNET) and High Risk Medulloblastoma(HRMB) without or with High Dose Methotrexate(HDMTX). A Report from Children's Oncology Group C. Mazewski 1, Kang2, 1Emory University School of Medicine Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Department of Pediatrics, Alpharetta, USA; 2St Research Hospital, Radiology, Seattle 7John's Hopkins University, Pathology, Baltimore MD, USA; 8Children's Hospital of Los Angeles, Pathology, Los Angeles CA, Children's Hospital, TN, USA; 11Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Neurological Surgery, Pittsburgh PA, USA Background/Objectives: ACNS0334's primary objective was to determine if children <36 months old with HRMB and SPNET treated with intensive chemotherapy plus HDMTX results in higher complete response (CR) rates than the same regimen without methotrexate(w/oMtx). Design/Methods: Between 08/2007 and 05/2014, ACNS0334 enrolled 91 patients. Patients received 3 Induction Cycles (Cyclophosphamide/Etoposide/Vincristine/Cisplatin+/ HDMTX) followed by 3 Consolidation Cycles (Carboplatin/Thiotepa then autologous stem cell rescue(ASCR)). After completing consolidation, radiation(RT) was at treating physician's discretion. Results: Seventyseven patients were eligible after central pathology review, 59 were evaluable for response by central radiology. After Induction 3/20 patients with HRMB treated w/oMTX achieved CR versus 7/19 treated with HDMTX. After Consolidation 6/20 without and 12/19 with HDMTX achieved CR(p=0.038). For HRMB, not desmoplastic, not cell, Induction 1/11 achieved CR w/oMTX and 5/12 with HDMTX. After Consolidation 3/11 treated without 7/12 CR and achieved CR and 7/9 without and 3/11 with HDMTX after Consolidation (p=0.07). Estimated 2 and 5year Event Free Survival (EFS) for 46 eligible HRMB=68.2+/9.6% and 68.2+/14.5% for the HDMTX arm and 45.8+/9.7% and 45.8+/13.8% for the arm w/oMTX(p=0.17). Twentysix patients are in followup (Median 4.6 years, range 2.58.3 years). Estimated 2 and 5year EFS rates for 31 eligible SPNET =29.2+/11% and 29.2+/17.4% with Methotrexate the arm w/oMTX(N=15) (p=0.44).Eleven patients are in followup (Median 4.2 years, range1.27.4 years). Of 34 survivors, 24(71%) were never irradiated, 10 were irradiated (6 before relapse and 4 after relapse). Conclusions: Postconsolidation CR rate and 5yr EFS were better for HRMB treated with HDMTX versus those treated with the same regimen w/oMTX. The 5year EFS for HRMB patients on ACNS0334 HDMTX arm is better than the EFS reported in the literature for CCG9921, COG 99703 and HeadStart. O-014 ACNS1221: A Phase II Study for Non Metastatic Desmoplastic Medulloblastoma in Children < 4 Years of Age. A Report of the Children Oncology Group L. LafayCousin 1, E. Bouffet2, G.

However, treatmentrelated neurotoxicity remains a significant concern in this vulnerable group of patients. Design/Methods: We prospectively conducted a singlearm multicenter trial of conventional chemotherapy for nonmetastatic ND/MBEN patients < 4 y old, based on a modified HIT SKK 2000 regimen excluding intraventricular methotrexate, aiming to achieve similar outcome with a reduced treatmentrelated neurotoxicity. The design required 37 patients and targeted a 2y PFS 90%. Secondary objectives included feasibility of timely central pathology review, evaluation of molecular profile and neurocognitive outcome. Results: Between 12/2013 and 07/2016, 26 patients (16 males, 10 females) were enrolled. Nineteen patients had ND and 7 had MBEN histology. The median age at diagnosis was 19.7 months (7.142.9). Four patients had residual disease at baseline. All cases were reviewed within 10 days by at least 2 of the 3 central neuropathologists. The study closed early for higher than expected relapse rate. At last followup, 7 patients had relapsed (3 local, 2 distant and 2 combined) at a median time of 9.7 months from diagnosis(range, 9.513.7). One patient died of disease. At the median followup time of 1 year (range, 0.21.9 years) was (p=0.009) age (p=0.07) may be associated with worse PFS. None of the MBEN patients relapsed. A detailed molecular analysis utilizing DNA methylation arrays, nextgeneration sequencing of tumor and matched germline is underway to characterize biologic heterogeneity that could predict for a differential response. Conclusions: The proposed modified regimen of chemotherapy without intraventricular methotrexate failed to achieve the desirable 2 y PFS of 90%, leading to premature closure of the study. The results of the molecular characterization of this ND/MBEN cohort may help uncover patients who may still benefit from this regimen. O-015 Time, Pattern and Outcome of Medulloblastoma Relapse is Biology and TherapyDependent R. Hill 1, S. Richardson1, J. Lindsey1, S. Crosier1, Schwalbe1, S. Clifford1 1Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Wolfson Childhood Cancer Research Centre, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom; 2Great North Children's Hospital, Pathology Department, Newcastle Tyne, United Kingdom; 3University of Nottingham, Children's Brain Tumour Research Centre, Nottingham, United Kingdom; 4University of Sheffield, Sheffield Institute for Translational Neuroscience, Sheffield, United Kingdom; 5UCL Institute of Child Health, Neural Development Unit, London, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: Medulloblastoma relapse occurs in 3040% of patients, is almost universally fatal, and accounts for 10% of childhood cancer deaths. Design/Methods: We undertook a comprehensive characterisation of the clinical features of medulloblastoma recurrence (e.g. timetorelapse/patternofrelapse) in a cohort of 249 relapsed patients. We related these to clinicomolecular features at diagnosis (e.g. highrisk prognostic factors), with the aim of establishing whether disease characteristics at diagnosis are associated with the nature of recurrence and subsequent disease course. Results: Disease course following relapse was therapydependent. Survival was rare (9/187 (5%)) in patients receiving standardupfronttreatment (neurosurgery, craniospinalirradiation (CSI), chemotherapy) across all disease demographics. Notable survival rates were only observed following nonCSI treatment at diagnosis (11/62 (18%) patients); all were <4 years at diagnosis, and overall survival in this cohort was associated with desmoplastic/nodular histology and CSI at relapse subgroupdependent. mean, 0.38.9 years range; p=0.003 logrank), a years, 0.25.5 years; p=0.00019). Acquisition of metastatic/distant recurrence occurred at similar rates across all subgroups (5060% patients). However, final incidence of metastatic (12/21, 57%; p=0.0017), reflecting the lower rate of metastasis at presentation in MBSHH.Distantlyrelapsed MBSHH patients were associated disease nodular and diffuse distant relapses. Conclusions: Recurrence remains the most significant challenge in medulloblastoma, with cure only observed in a subset of radiona\u00efve infants. In conventionallytreated patients, subgroup predicts timetorelapse and patternofrelapse, with clear potential to inform disease monitoring/management. Further work is essential to understand the biology/clinical behavior of recurrence, and its exploitation to improve therapies. O-016 An International Expert Consensus Survey for A Treatment Versus Observation Strategy of Newly Diagnosed Patients with NF1 Associated Optic Pathway Glioma Research Centre, Nottingham, United Kingdom; 2University of Udine, Department of Medical and Biological Science, Udine, Italy; 3Nottingham University Hospital, NHS Trust, Nottingham, Padua, Department of Pediatrics, Padua, Italy; 5Medical University of Vienna, Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Vienna, Austria; 6Copenhagen University Hospital, Department of Pediatrics, Copenhagen, Denmark; 7Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Department of Pediatrics, Philadelphia Pennsylvania, USA; 8Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, Department of Radiology, Nottingham, United Kingdom; 9Leeds Teaching NHS Trust, London, United Kingdom; 13Charit\u00e9Universit\u00e4tsmedizin, Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Berlin, Germany; 14St Mary's Hospital, Department of Genetic Medicine, Manchester, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: Optic pathway glioma (OPG) develop in 1520% of children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), threatening vision loss but not survival. There is no consensus about the most appropriate strategy for selecting newly diagnosed patients with NF1 for treatment or observation. Design/Methods: 25 representative case scenarios, derived from a riskadapted matrix of newly diagnosed children with NF1 OPG, previously entered the SIOP LGG 2004 trial, were used for a strategy selection consensus survey. The respondents were 98 multidisciplinary specialists for the first survey (10 cases) and 46 for the second survey (15 cases) from an international multiprofessional expert group. Respondents selected cases for initial observation (O) initial treatment (T) or randomisation between the two (R), justifying their selection with free text comments. A qualitative analysis of the free text comments describing reasoning was carried out by two reviewers and a mediator, following the grounded theory approach, allocating reasons to 8 themes, developed inductively. Results: Greater than 70% agreement between survey respondents occurred for initial observation in 4/25 cases, initial treatment in 10/25 cases, less than 70% consensus occurred in 11/25 cases. The associated 808 free text comments justifying selection for O: 173; T: 426 and R: 209 were allocated by 2 reviewers to 8 themes (agreement; k: 0.762). Consensus selection for: observation was justified by risk of progression (39%) and visual function (33%); for treatment by visual function (39%); for randomization by visual function (31%), risk of progression (22%), site/dimension of tumour (15%) and age and gender (12%). Conclusions: This survey and its qualitative analysis identifies a new consensus of justified criteria for initial observation versus treatment, in 11/25 scenarios no consensus was reached. These criteria are proposed as eligibility criteria for future trials where a randomised trial of indications for initial management could be included. on behalf of the SIOPE NF1 OPG Nottingham, UK, Workshop (Participating centers: Berlin, Copenhagen, GOS, Hamburg, Leeds, Nottingham, Padua, Paris, Vienna) O-017 Comparison of Academic Achievement Scores After Proton and Photon Therapy in Children and Young Adults with Craniopharyngioma T.

Conklin4 1St. Jude Hospital, Department of Radiation Oncology, Memphis, USA; 2University of Florida Proton Therapy Institute, Department of Radiation Oncology, Jacksonville, USA; 3St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Department of Biostatistics, Memphis, USA; 4St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Department of Psychology, Memphis, USA Background/Objectives: Patients with craniopharyngioma treated with radiation therapy risk deficits in cognitive function. Proton therapy reduces the volume and dose of normal tissue exposure compared to photon therapy. Cognitive testing results from two prospective trials were used to compare proton (NCT01419067) and photon (NCT00187226) cohorts. Design/Methods: Patients (age < 22 years) with craniopharyngioma were enrolled on prospective trials that included proton (20112016) or photon (19982010) therapy and serial cognitive testing. Proton therapy (54CGE) was administered using passive scattering methods targeting the postoperative residual tumor and tumor bed surrounded by an anatomicallyconstrained 5mm clinical target volume margin (CTV). Photon therapy (54Gy) was administered using conformal or intensitymodulated methods targeting a 510mm CTV. Tests of academic achievement (reading and math) were administered before and after treatment. Test scores were modeled with normal tissue dose variables to compare scores by modality. Results: Fiftytwo patients treated with proton therapy were compared to 70 treated with photon therapy. Whole brain dose (median, range) was lower for the proton cohort (7.63CGE, 0.2516.40CGE) compared to the photon cohort (17.35Gy, 11.0027.56Gy) (p < 0.0001). There was no difference comparing scores based on modality. When mean brain dose was included in the model, patients treated with photon therapy had a greater decline in reading and math scores. Rate of change (points/CGE or Gy/month) in reading scores was 0.001274 for proton and 0.1020 for photon (p = 0.0018). The rate of change in math scores was 0.000614 for proton and 0.08266 for photon (p = 0.0263). Score estimates based on median doses (baseline vs. 36 month) for reading and math were 103.08 vs. 103.13 and 100.98 vs. 101 for proton compared 96.87 and 99.33 vs. 96.36 for photon. Conclusions: The results from a prospective trial of proton therapy for craniopharyngioma demonstrate preservation of academic achievement when compared to treatment using photons. Free Paper Session: All Clinical O-018 Delayed Intensification (DI) Enhances Continuous Complete Remission (CCR) Rates for Patients with BALL when Combined with Intravenous Methotrexate: Childrens Oncology Group Study (COG) POG W.

Design/Methods: NCISR patients those with trisomy of chromosomes 4+10 and NCIHR pts who met refined age and WBC criteria (excluding those with t(9;22), t(4;11), or CNS3) were eligible to participate in the DI randomization. Consolidation included 6 courses of IV MTX with leucovorin rescue with randomization to +/ DI after the 3rd IV MTX course (week 16). DI included: weekly vincristine and daunomycin weeks 1618 with daily dexamethasone 6 mg/m2, PEG asparaginase week 16 and intrathecal MTX weeks 16, 20, 21, Cyclophosphamide week 20, subcutaneous AraC daily x 4, weeks 20 and 21, and 6thioguanine weeks 2122. End induction minimal residual disease (MRD) was measured but not used to alter therapy. Results: Administration of DI improved 10year p=0.0016), but not have a significant effect on overall survival (OS): no DI DI. was highly predictive of outcome with 10 yr CCRs of 87.7 + 2.2 and 82.1 + 2.5% among the MRD<0.01% patients with/without DI and 54.3 + 8 and 44 + 8% for the MRD0.01% patients with/without DI (p < 0.001). Conclusions: A delayed intensification phase enhances the CCR rate for a broad population of patients with BALL including those with and without end induction MRD at < 0.01%, but does not impact OS. Expected EFS rates obtained in this study are lower than obtained with more contemporary trials. O-019 Substitution with Cyclophosphamide and Etoposide does not Improve Outcome for Children and Young Adults with Very High Risk BLymphoblastic Leukemia: Children's Oncology Group Study AALL1131 M. Chen3, M. Devidas3, Gore4, S. 1Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, Pediatrics, Milwaukee, USA; 2U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command, Pediatrics, Fort Detrick, USA; 3University of Florida, Biostatistics, Gainesville, Colorado, Pediatrics, Aurora, Children's Cancer Program, Pediatrics, Scarborough, USA; 6Primary Children's Hospital, Pediatrics, Salt lake City, USA; 7UT Southwestern, Pediatrics, Dallas, USA; 8New York University, Pediatrics, New York, USA; 9Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Pediatrics, Philadelphia, USA; 10UCSF, Pediatrics, San Francisco, USA Background/Objectives: With modern chemotherapy regimens, >90% of patients with pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are now cured. However, subsets of patients can be identified who remain at very high risk (VHR) of relapse with expected 4year DFS <80% and are appropriate candidates for more intensive therapeutic strategies designed to improve survival. AALL1131 aimed to determine, in a randomized fashion, if the substitution with cyclophosphamide + etoposide (CPM/ETOP) (Experimental Arm 1; Exp1) would improve the 4year DFS of children, adolescents, and young adults with VHR BALL compared to a modified BerlinFrankfurtM\u00fcnster regimen; (Control Arm; CA). Design/Methods: Patients 130 years of age with newly diagnosed VHR BALL were randomized postInduction in a 1:2 (440mg/m2 days 15)/ETOP (100mg/m2 days 15) (Exp 1) during Part 2 of Consolidation (CONS) and Delayed Intensification (DI). Both arms included the same dose and schedule of PEGasparaginase on day 43 and vincristine days 43 and 50 of CONS and DI. Prospective interim monitoring rules for efficacy and futility were included where futility would be determined for a onesided pvalue 0.7664. Results: There were no significant differences in Grade 3/4 adverse events or delays in starting Interim Maintenance between the 2 arms (Table 1). Using a data cutoff date of 12/31/2016, 41 total events occurred between arms (CA: 10/228 vs. Exp1: 31/458) resulting in of 1.3904 (onesided pvalue = 0.9178). The study was stopped for futility as the interim monitoring boundary was crossed [Hazard Ratio 0.606 (95% CI: 0.297 1.237)] (Figure 1) of AALL1131 was closed February 2017. Conclusions: Substitution of therapy for VHR BALL patients on COG AALL1131 randomized to CPM/ETOP during Part 2 of CONS and DI did not improve EFS. O-020 Dasatinib Maintains Outstanding 5Year Survival Outcomes in Children with PH+ ALL, but does not Prevent CNS Relapses: Children's Oncology Group (COG) AALL0622 Kairalla3, Pediatrics, Victoria BC, Canada; Department of FL, USA; 5University of California Los Angeles, Pediatrics, Los Angeles CA, USA; 6Dana Farber Cancer Institute/Harvard, Pediatrics, Boston MA, USA; 7Johns University School of Medicine, Hematopathology, Baltimore MD, USA; 8University of Alabama, Deparment of Pathology and Genetics, BirminghamAB, USA; 9Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Pathology, Columbus USA; 10Nationwide Children's Hospital, Pathology, Columbus OH, USA; 11University of Florida, Medicine, Gainesville Fl, USA; 12University of Washington, Pathology, Seattle WA, USA; 13St. Jude Research Hospital, Radiation Therapy, Memphis TN, USA; 14Children's Hospital Hershey, Pediatrics, Hershey PA, USA; 15University of Utah, Pediatrics, Salt Lake City UT, USA; 16University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Pediatrics, Dallas TX, USA; 17University of CaliforniaSan Francisco, Pediatrics, San Francisco CA, USA; 18New York University, NYU Langone Cancer Center, New York NY, USA; 19University of Pennsylvania, Pediatrics, Philadelphia PA, USA Background/Objectives: Ph+ ALL patients treated with intensive chemotherapy plus continuous imatinib had a 68% 5year eventfree survival (EFS) rate (COG Compared to imatinib, dasatinib has increased potency, better CNS and activity imatinibresistant clones. Design/Methods: tested AALL0031 chemotherapy plus dasatinib 60 mg/m2/day in Ph+ ALL subjects (130 years). Cohort 1 subjects received dasatinib 2 weeks during each 34 week block; Cohort 2 subjects received dasatinib continuously. Stem cell transplant (SCT) was recommended for subjects with a sibling donor and highrisk (HR) subjects defined by minimal residual disease at end induction and consolidation. The remaining standardrisk (SR) subjects were treated with chemotherapy plus dasatinib. While all AALL0031 subjects received cranial For 60 evaluable subjects, 5year EFS and overall survival (OS) rates were 60\u00b17% and 86\u00b15%. 5year EFS/OS rates were HR underwent SCT). AALL0622 subjects had a 5year cumulative incidence rate of isolated or combined CNS relapse of 10.6\u00b14.1% vs 3.7\u00b12.6% (p = 0.20) for those treated with continuous imatinib on AALL0031. No difference in outcome was seen between AALL0031 subjects receiving imatinib continuously and AALL0622 cohorts 1 and \u00b1 p = 0.63). IKZF1 deletion was present in 57% of tested AALL0622 subjects (25/44) and was associated with significantly inferior 5year EFS (52\u00b110% 82.1\u00b110.1%, p=0.04) and p=0.04). Conclusions: There a nonsignificant trend toward increased rates of CNS relapse on AALL0622, but similar rates of 5year EFS/OS were obtained with intensive chemotherapy, imatinib and CRT and intensive chemotherapy plus dasatinib without deletions were associated with inferior EFS/OS. O-021 Osteonecrosis (ON) is Associated with Improved Event Free Survival (EFS) in HighRisk Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (HRALL): Results of Children's Oncology Group Study L.A. 1, USA; 2University Florida, COG Data Center Biostatistics, Gainesville Florida, USA; 3University of Utah Primary Children's Hospital, Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Salt Lake City Utah, USA; 4UCSF Medical Center, Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, San Francisco California, USA; Southwestern/Simmons Cancer Center, Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Dallas Texas, USA; of Philadelphia, Pediatric Pennsylvania, USA; 7NYU Langone Cancer Center, Hassenfeld New York New York, USA; 8Maine Children's Cancer Program, Pediatric Oncology, Scarborough Maine, USA Background/Objectives: ON is a wellcharacterized ALL therapeutic toxicity attributed to glucocorticoids, asparaginase (ASNase), and CCG1961, alternateweek dexamethasone (AWD; DEX) during double delayed intensification (DI) reduced ON vs continuous DEX (CD) with single DI in rapid early responders (RER) 10y. Design/Methods: HRALL patients 130y on AALL0232 with a randomization induction (HDMTX) vs escalatingdose MTX/asparaginase (eMTX/ASNase). RER received single, and slow early responders (SER) double, IM/DI. Initially, all received monthly DEX maintenance (MTC) pulses, patients 13y received DI AWD, and patients 12y received DI CD. There were 2 ONrelated amendments: after 10/2006 all patients 10y received DI AWD; after 6/2008 all patients 10y were assigned to IND PDN, and all patients received DI AWD and MTC PDN pulses. Results: ON was confirmed in (DEX patients CI was 22.0% with no difference by regimen. Fiveyear EFS was significantly higher among randomized patients 10y with vs without ON (88.5% vs 72.9%; P<0.0001); this finding was present in different age ranges (10y, 13y, 16y) and RER/SER subsets within 80.6%; P=0.0046) and SER (74.8% vs 41.5%; P<0.0001) cohorts. Across groups ASNase allergy was significantly associated with reduced ON risk (10y: HR 0.43; P=0.0013). Conclusions: Patients who develop ON have significantly increased EFS, suggesting host differences that increase sensitivity to develop ON and render ALL cells more chemoresponsive. O-022 Outcome of BALL Treated with A RiskStratified and ResponseAdapted Protocol: Interim Analysis of A SingleInstitution Pilot Study for A Multicenter Collaborative Protocol from India G. Narula 1, B. Arora1, Subramanian2, P. Tembhare2, S. Center, Oncology India; Memorial Center, Hematopathology, Mumbai, India; 3Tata Memorial Center, Cytogenetics, Mumbai, India Background/Objectives: Childhood ALL in developed countries has OS exceeding 95%, but remains challenging in developing countries. Since 2012, multiple centers in India have collaborated to devise a protocol for uniform management of ALL using comprehensive riskstratification and responsebased adaption. The standard arms of this protocol were piloted in our institution since 2013, and an interim analysis was done at 3year timepoint. Design/Methods: Prospectively maintained records of BALL patients treated on a uniform strategy from Feb2013 to Dec2015 were analyzed. Riskstratification was done based on NCI criteria, further adapted by prednisolone response (D8PR), and flowcytometric day35 bonemarrow MRD was analyzed and KaplanMeier method on SPSSv24. Results: Sevenhundred and twentysix children with BALL were registered in the study period. Thirteen were excluded due to ambiguous classification or protocol deviation. Median age was 5 yrs (0.515) and median WBC10x103/cmm (0.1543x103/cmm). Bulky disease was seen in 253(35%), tumor lysis in 297(42%), CSF involvement in 34(5%), in 98(14%). The initial riskstratification was Standard Risk (SR)219(31%), Intermediate (IR)267(37%), and High (HR)227(32%). Of 666 evaluable by D35BMMRD, 147(22%) were positive. Projected 3year OS was 90.4\u00b11.4% with median followup of 23 months (range, 148), while EFS was 70.7\u00b12.3%. 70% of mortality occurred in intensive phases of treatment, and 86% of all events in nonSR arms. Threeyear OS for SR, IR and HR were 89.5\u00b12.3% D35BMMRD status predicted in negative cases (p<0.001). Conclusions: A riskstratified responseadapted protocol helped improve outcomes for childhood BALL over historical results. D35BMMRD positivity predicted poorer EFS. Early mortality and relapse in nonSR BALL remain the biggest challenges. O-023 Polymorphisms in the Thymidylate Synthetase (TYMS) Gene in Relation to MethotrexateInduced Oral Mucositis in Children with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia N. Oosterom 1, M. Berrevoets2, M. Den Hoed1, S. Pluijm1, R. Pieters1, R. De Van HeuvelEibrink1, S. Heil2 1Princess M\u00e1xima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Department of Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands; 2Erasmus Medical Center, Department of Clinical Chemistry, Rotterdam, The Netherlands; 3VU Medical Center, Department of Clinical Chemistry, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; 4Beatrix Children's Hospital University of Groningen University Medical Center of Pediatric Oncology, Groningen, The Netherlands Background/Objectives: Methotrexate (MTX) is a potent drug in the treatment of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). MTX is cytotoxic as it impairs DNA and RNA synthesis by inhibiting the enzymes dihydrofolate reductase (DHFTR) and thymidylate synthase (TYMS). receiving highdose MTX regimens develop MTXinduced oral mucositis. The association and genetic variants within the Thymidylate Synthase (TYMS) gene has been studied, but results are contradictory and inconsistent. We studied the association between three previously described variants within the TYMS gene in relation to MTXinduced oral mucositis in a prospective cohort of Dutch children with ALL. Design/Methods: We analyzed a 28base pair repeat (2R3R; rs34743033), a single nucleotide polymorphism present on the (3RG>C; rs2853542) 6base within the TYMS gene in germline DNA of 117 pediatric ALL patients treated with 5 gram m2 MTX (DCOG ALL10 protocol). Clinically relevant oral mucositis was defined as grade 3 according to the National Cancer Institute Criteria. Data were analyzed for the individual rs3474303 (2R3R) and rs151264360 with rs3474303 (2R3R) and analyzed according to predicted expression levels of TYMS: low expression (2R2R, 2R3RC, 3RC3RC) versus rs3474303 (2R3R) and rs151264360 (6bp deletion) polymorphisms were not associated with the development of MTXinduced oral mucositis (OR 2.49 [0.689.20] and OR 0.79 [0.203.10] respectively). Patients carrying the low expression TYMS genotype had a trend towards developing MTXinduced oral mucositis, significantly (OR 2.42 [0.86 - 6.80], pvalue 0.09). Conclusions: We could the association between TYMS polymorphisms and MTXinduced mucositis. However, the strong effect size suggests a possible role of the low expression genotype in MTXinduced mucositis. This needs to be addressed in a metaanalysis. Free Paper Session: Late Effects O-024 Dose Volume Parameters of the Radiation Dose Distribution in Cerebral Arteries are Highly Predictive of Long Term Risk of Stroke after Childhood Cancer Radiotherapy F. de Vathaire 1, C. ElFayech2, N. Bic\u00eatre, France Background/Objectives: Stroke is one of the major potential long term iatrogenic risk of childhood cancer radiation therapy. Nevertheless, present knowledge is insufficient to predict the longterm risk of stroke following radiation therapy as the doseresponse to fractionated high doses of radiation to the brain is not known. Design/Methods: We carried out an analysis in a cohort 7030 5years survivors of a solid childhood cancer treated in France before 2001, of whom 4150 treated by radiotherapy, and followed 20 years in average, by selfquestionnaire and crosslinkage with French National Hospital and Medical Insurance Database (SNIIRAM). During the followup, 139 patients developed a permanent stroke which could be validated. Each of them was matched to 8 controls of the same cohort on gender, age at childhood cancer and followup duration. Radiation dose distribution in cerebral arteries was individually reconstructed for each case and controls treated by radiotherapy using medical records and anthropometric phantoms. Results: As compared to children not treated by radiation therapy, and when controlling for chemotherapy, children who received less than 1 Gy, in average, to the cerebral arteries had a 1.8 (95%CI: 0.803.9) times higher risk of stroke, whereas those who received more than 20 Gy to cerebral arteries had a risk 26.0 (10.067.8) times higher. These risk factors were higher for ischemic strokes than for haemorrhagic ones. To take into account dosevolume parameters allowed to improve risk predictions. High radiation doses strongly increased stroke risk. As an example, to received during childhood 30Gy or more to only 1 to 5% of the cerebral arteries volume increased the long term risk of stroke by 2.6 (1.35.5). Conclusions: This study confirms that average radiation dose to the cerebral arteries is not the best parameter for predicting long term risk of stroke, and that classical dosevolume parameters may be used for such predictions. O-025 LongTerm Efficacy of ThyroidStimulatingHormone (TSH)Suppression is very frequent after neck/mediastinum RT, whose effects also depend on circulating TSH, a sensitive marker of thyroid damage. In 1998 we evaluated the protective effect of pharmacological TSHsuppression during craniospinalRT for MBL and neck/mediastinum RT for HL, and relative preliminary results at medium 7/8 years were promising. Our aim is updating a definitive message to our community. Design/Methods: Children scheduled for craniospinalRT for MBL or RT for HL underwent thyroid ultrasound and FT3, FT4, TSH evaluation at beginning/end of RT. From 14 days before and up to the end of RT, patients received Lthyroxine; every 3 days, TSHsuppression was checked to ensure TSH <0.3 mM/ml. Blood tests and ultrasound were repeated after 1 year; primary hypothyroidism was defined as TSH over normal range. Results: 25 MBL and 14 HL patients had a median followup of 175/185 months of their thyroid status, respectively. At RT end we divided patients according to TSH either 0.3 mM/ml or 0.3 throughout their radiation treatment (representing the cohorts of TSHsuppression or not, respectively). Though numerically small, the cohorts were well matched (gender/age/disease stage/chemotherapy courses/thyroid bed RT/duration of followup). Hypothyroidismfree survival rates were significantly different after doubling the followup of the previous publications. In MBL group it was 62.5% for the TSHsuppression cohort and 20% for the non TSHsuppression cohort for the HL group, The appearance of colloidal cysts/solid nodules did not differ in the two groups. Conclusions: Thyroid dysfunction may develop from a few months to years after RT end. In children with lengthy antineoplastic treatments, endocrine disorders have a negative effect on growth and development into adulthood. We showed how hypothyroidism can be possibly easily and cheaply prevented in the longterm in two populations at great risk of lateeffects after RT. O-026 Impact of Ovarian Transposition on Ovarian Function among LongTerm Survivors of Childhood Hodgkin Lymphoma: A Report from the ST. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study I. FernandezPineda 1, Department of Surgery, Memphis, USA; 2St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Department of Epidemiology & Cancer Control, Memphis, USA; 3St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Department of Biostatistics, Memphis, USA; 4St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Department of Psychology, Memphis, USA; 5St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Department of Oncology, Memphis, USA; 6St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Department of Radiation Oncology, Memphis, USA; 7Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Department of Epidemiology & Endocrinology, New York, USA; 8St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Department of Endocrinology, Memphis, USA Background/Objectives: Data regarding the efficacy of ovarian transposition (OT) to preserve ovarian function among childhood cancer survivors are limited. We aimed to determine the effect of OT on ovarian function among longterm survivors of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) treated with pelvic radiotherapy. Design/Methods: Female participants in the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study (SJLIFE) (10+ years from diagnosis, age 18+ years) treated with pelvic radiotherapy for HL were clinically evaluated for premature menopause (PM). Multivariable logistic regression was used to study associations between demographic and treatmentrelated risk factors as well as OT and PM. Survivors with a history of surgical menopause or bilateral oophorectomy before age 40 years were excluded. Results: Of 184 eligible females with HL, 158 (86%) were treated with pelvic radiotherapy. Of these, 84 (53%) participated in SJLIFE including 45 who underwent OT before pelvic radiotherapy. Median age was 16 years (range 422) at HL diagnosis and 38 years (range 2560) at study. Pelvic radiotherapy > 1,500 cGy (HR 95% to 18.19; 0.005) and equivalent = 4.71, 95% CI =2.04 to 10.86; P<.001) were associated with PM. There was no significant association between OT and occurrence of PM (HR = 1.21, 95% CI = 0.42 to 3.49; p = 0.720). Among women with PM, median age at menopause was not significantly different in patients with (25 years; range, 1338.5) or without (21.5 years; range, 1437) (P= 0.530) OT. Conclusions: OT did not seem to modify the risk of PM in this historic cohort of longterm survivors of HL treated with gonadotoxic therapy. Further research in younger cohorts is needed given continued improvements in radiotherapy delivery techniques. Modern fertility preservation modalities such as mature oocyte cryopreservation should be offered to patients at risk whenever feasible. O-027 Second and Subsequent Malignant Neoplasms after Cancer in Childhood in Finland: A PopulationBased Registry Study L. MadanatHarjuoja 1,2, Cancer Registry, Childhood Cancer, Helsinki, Finland; 3Turku University Hospital, Department of Pediatrics, Helsinki, Finland; 4Children's Hospital and Helsinki University Central Hospitals, Division of pediatric hematooncology and stem cell transplantation, Helsinki, Finland Background/Objectives: Our aim was to evaluate the relative risk of second malignant neoplasms (SMNs) among survivors of childhood cancer (diagnosed under age 15) and investigate whether modern treatment regimens have resulted in reductions in the occurrence of second malignant neoplasms. Design/Methods: Childhood cancer patients and their second malignant neoplasms diagnosed between 1953 and 2007 were identified from the Finnish Cancer Registry. Risk of second malignancy was evaluated using standardized incidence ratios (SIRs). The effect of temporal characteristics including diagnostic era and length of followup and disease related characteristics were assessed. Results: We observed 372 subsequent malignancies among 7696 survivors with 112,809 personyears of follow up. The relative risk of developing a second malignancy was nearly five times higher than expected (SIR 4.83, 95% CI, 4.355.34). SIRs were equal in both genders (p=0.9). The risk of SMNs stayed elevated in patients treated in the most modern eras with SIRs of 8.99 (95% CI 5.8613.8). SIRs were highest within one year after the primary cancer (SIR 11.2, 95% CI, 6.1518.4) and decreased linearly until reaching the population cancer risk after 50 years of followup. Conclusions: Childhood cancer survivors are at elevated risk of SMNs. This elevated risk applies also to those diagnosed in the more recent eras and does not reach a plateau during followup of up to 50 years. Patients should be encouraged to take part in cancer screening programs and avoid exposure to carcinogens such as tobacco and UVradiation. O-028 Mental Healthcare use and Severe Psychiatric Diagnoses in Adult Survivors of Childhood Cancer: A PopulationBased Study Using Health Services Data S. Gupta 1, A. Nachman2, P. Kurdyak3, R. Sutradhar4, J. Pole5, P. for Sick Children, Haematology/Oncology, Toronto, Canada; 2University of Toronto, Institute of Medical Science, Toronto, Canada; 3Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, Mental Health & Addictions Research Program, Toronto, Canada; 4Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, Cancer Research Program, Toronto, Canada; 5Pediatric Oncology Group of Ontario, POGO Research Unit, Toronto, Canada Background/Objectives: Though physical late effects in childhood cancer survivors are welldocumented, risks for adverse mental health outcomes are less clear; existing evidence is contradictory. Health services data offer an objective method to measure populationbased mental health outcomes. Design/Methods: Using a provincial registry with detailed disease, treatment, and outcome data, we assembled a cohort of all fiveyear childhood cancer survivors diagnosed <18 years and treated in an Ontario pediatric cancer Centre between 19872008. Patients were linked to populationbased healthcare data capturing inpatient, outpatient, and emergency department (ED) visits. The primary outcome was the rate of mental healthcare visits (primary care, psychiatrist, ED or hospital). Secondary outcomes included time to a severe mental health event (ED visit, hospitalization, suicide) both overall and by psychiatric diagnostic categories. Outcomes were compared between survivors and matched controls using recurrent event and survival analyses, and predictors of adverse outcomes modeled. Results: When compared to 20,269 controls, 4,117 survivors had a significantly higher rate of mental health visits [47.1 vs. 36.1 visits/100 personyears; adjusted relative rate (RR) 1.3, 95th% confidence interval (CI) 1.21.5]. Higher rates were associated with female gender (RR 1.4, CI 1.11.7; p=0.008) and adolescent age at diagnosis (RR 2.0, CI 1.33.0; p=0.004). Cancer type, treatment intensity or treatments targeting the central nervous system were not significant predictors. The hazard of a severe mental health event did not differ between survivors and controls. Though rare in both groups, survivors were at increased risk of a severe event due to a psychotic disorder (HR 1.8, CI 1.12.8; p<0.05). Conclusions: Childhood cancer survivors experience higher rates of mental health visits than the general population, but are no more likely to experience a severe mental health event. Their risk is not attributable to a specific diagnosis or aspect of treatment. An increased risk of severe psychotic disorders requires confirmation in other cohorts. O-029 Role of Ace Inhibitors in AnthracyclineInduced Cardiotoxicity: A Randomized Double Blind Placebo Controlled Trial V. Gupta 1, S.K. Singh1, V. Agrawal2, T.B. Singh3 1Institute University, Pediatrics, Varanasi, Background/Objectives: Anthracyclines cause doserelated cardiotoxicity in children. Several measures including drugs have been tried to reduce cardiac toxicity. Lack of randomized trials prompted this study to assess role of ACE inhibitor (enalapril) in anthracycline induced cardiotoxicity in children with hematological malignancies. Design/Methods: Randomized double blind placebo controlled trial was conducted in University teaching hospital over 26 months (Trial no. CTRI/2015/09/006174). 84 patients with leukemia (41) and lymphoma (43) were randomized to receive either enalapril [group A (44)] or placebo [group B (40)] for 6 months. Patients received anthracyclines (doxorubicin and/or daunorubicin) (cumulative dose ProBNP, CKMB) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were assessed at base line and after 6 months. Primary outcome was decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (decrease 20% significant). Secondary outcomes were changes in cardiac biomarkers, development of heart failure, arrhythmias and side effects such as dizziness and hypotension. Results: Cardiac biomarkers increased at 6 months in all patients with more increase in group B. It was significant for pro BNP (49.60 \u00b1 35.97 vs \u00b1 0.44, p value 9.1% patients in group A showed increase in ProBNP level 100 pg/ml compared to 37.5% patients in Group B (p=0.001). LVEF decreased in both groups, more in group B (62.25 \u00b1 5.49 vs 56.15 \u00b1 4.79, p = 0.04). 20% decrease in LVEF was seen in 3 patients in group B and none in group A (p value 0.04). LVEF remained 50% in both groups at 6 months. No patient developed heart failure. Conclusions: Enalapril has a role in reducing acute cardiac toxicity after anthracycline administration. Further studies are needed to assess long term protection. Free Paper Session: Myeloid Leukemia and Transplant O-030 Characteristics and Outcome of Myeloid Sarcoma in Children at A Tertiary Care Centre from India: A Study of 126 Patients A. Kumar 1, A. Tyagi1, R. Pramanik1, A. Batra1, A. Chopra2, S. Bakhshi1 1All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Department of Medical Oncology 2nd Floor BRA IRCH, New Delhi, India; 2All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Department of Lab Oncology 4th Floor BRA IRCH, New Delhi, India Background/Objectives: Myeloid sarcoma (MS) is a rare entity and it can precede or appear concomitantly with acute myeloid leukemia. Conventionally, it has been treated on lines of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, paucity of data in larger number of patients has led to difficulty in understanding its nature and management. Design/Methods: Present study was undertaken among children with MS presenting at a large tertiary care center in India from June, 2008 to Feb, 2016. All patients were treated on a uniform chemotherapy treatment protocol; radiotherapy was not used during the management. Results: Among 570 patients of AML (non-promyelocytic) attending our pediatric oncology clinic, 126 patients (22.1%) had MS at presentation. Median age was 6 years (0.3-18 years) and incidence was more common among males (M: F = 2.4:1). Cytogenetic parameters were available in 100 patients; good risk cytogenetics were found in 54% patients; this was significantly higher than non MS associated cohort (p=0.0001) wherein the good risk cytogenetics was observed in 28.2%of subjects. All 54 patients in good risk group of the MS cohort had t(8:21). At median followup of 21 months, median event free survival was 19.4 months in MS group versus 11.1 months in non MS associated AML (p=0.003). Overall survival was 37.2 months versus 16.2 months in MS group versus non MS group, respectively (p=0.0009). Conclusions: MS are present in about onefifth of AML patients; this is distinctly more than the worldwide prevalence. The cohort with MS had a higher proportion of good risk cytogenetics with a striking association with t(8:21). Presently adopted AML like treatment strategy in such patients has resulted in favorable outcome in comparison to the non MS associated cohort. O-031 Arsenic Trioxide and AllTransRetinoic Acid Based Trial May Eliminate the Need for Cytarabine In Pediatric Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia: Results from CCAPL2010 (NCT01191541) L. Zhang 1, Z. Z. Yao Zou1, Yumei1, G. Ye1, Q. 1State Laboratory of Experimental Hematology Institute of Hematology and Blo, Department of Pediatrics, tianjin, China Background/Objectives: The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of using alltransretinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO) to treat paediatric patients with newly diagnosed leaukemia (APL). Additionly, we assessed whether cytosine arabinoside (AraC) could be omitted in ATO and ATRA based trials. Design/Methods: Patients were assigned to receive ATRA plus ATO for induction followed by idarubicin (IDA) and ATO. Then, patients were randomly assigned to receive 2 courses of daunorubicin (DNR, no AraC group) or DNR+AraC (AraC group) followed by maintenance therapy for 1.5 years. Results: Between May 2010 and December 2016, 66 consecutive pediatric (14years old) patients who were genetically confirmed with a new diagnosis of APL were admitted in our hospital. Among 66 patients, 43 were male and 23 were female. All patients achieved complete remission (CR) except one who gave up treatment. During induction therapy, all toxicity events were reversed after appropriate management. No patient died at consolidation, and only one patient relapsed. In addition, there was no difference in outcomes between the two groups. After a median followup of 32 months, EFS was 97.0\u00b13.0%, and OS was 100%. No factor impacted relapse or survival in our study. There was no difference in the median arsenic concentrations in plasma, urine, hair, and nail samples between patients in whom arsenic treatment had been ceased for more than 12 months and normal controls. Conclusions: The results of our study indicate that ATO is safe and effective in paediatric APL and that AraC can be omitted, at least when using regimens similar to ours. Our analysis of arsenic levels in the plasma, urine, hair and nails of patients indicated that there was no significant accumulation of arsenic after ATO was discontinued for 12 months. O-032 Efficacy and Safety of Nilotinib in Pediatric Patients with Philadelphia Chromosome-Positive (PH+) Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML): Results from A PHASE 2 Trial N. Hijiya 1, A. Maschan2, C.

Design/Methods: Eligible patients (1<18y) had CML in chronic phase (CP/AP) resistant/intolerant to imatinib/dasatinib, or newlydiagnosed CMLCP; no patients with CMLAP enrolled. Patients were to receive oral nilotinib 230mg/m2 BID (rounded to nearest 50mg) for 66 28day cycles; data from primary analysis (when all patients had completed 12 cycles or discontinued) are reported. Primary endpoint for resistant/intolerant cohort was major molecular response rate (MMR; BCRABL1 0.1% on International Scale) at 6 cycles; coprimary endpoints for newlydiagnosed cohort were MMR rate by 12 cycles and complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) rate at 12 cycles. Results: n=25) age, 13y for both cohorts; median time ontreatment, 16 and 15 months, respectively). Results in the resistant/intolerant cohort were: 13/33 patients had MMR 95% CI, 22.9%57.9%); 6/13 had MMR at baseline. Median time to MMR was 2.8 (range, 011.3) months among 19 patients in MMR by the data cutoff. Twentyseven patients (81.8%) had CCyR by 12 cycles; 14/27 had CCyR at baseline. One patient progressed to AP/blast crisis after 10.1 months ontreatment. Results in newlydiagnosed patients were: rates of MMR by 12 cycles and CCyR at 12 cycles were both 64.0% (16/25; 95% CI, 42.5%82.0%). Median time to response was 5.6 months for both MMR and CCyR among 17 and 21 patients with those responses, respectively, by the data cutoff. All patients had 1 AE; allgrade AEs with incidences >30% overall (32.8%), and blood (31.0%). and AErelated discontinuations (allgrade) were 13.8% and 15.5%, respectively. No deaths were reported. Conclusions: Nilotinib 230mg/m2 BID was efficacious in pediatric patients with newlydiagnosed or resistant/intolerant CMLCP, with an AE profile comparable to that in adults. O-033 Prognostic Biomarkers for the Development of Respiratory Transplantation School of Medicine, Pediatrics, Indianapolis, USA; 2Indiana University School of Medicine, Medicine, Indianapolis, USA Background/Objectives: Currently, there is not a method for predicting respiratory failure in the allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipient. Biomarkers may be effective for risk recognition, understanding etiology, and serving as therapeutic targets. The study's aim was to identify prognostic biomarkers for the development of respiratory failure. Design/Methods: This is a single center analysis of an existing cohort from a clinicobiologic repository. Plasma samples at days 7, 14, 21, and 30 postHCT were used to measure four proteins by ELISA: STimulation2 (ST2), the IL33 receptor, interleukin 6 (IL6), tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) and osteopontin (OPN). Data is presented in medians and were compared using Wilcoxon rank sum test. ROC curves were also done for each protein. Results: A total of 122 adult and pediatric allogeneic HCT recipients were included with 24.6% (n=30) developing respiratory failure within 1 year posttransplant. The median day to respiratory failure was 27.0. The medians of all four proteins were significantly higher in the group that developed respiratory failure at multiple time points: Day 7 ST2 ROC curves indicate that these proteins allowed for good discrimination for the development of respiratory failure within 45 days of transplant were all significantly elevated at multiple time points in those that develop respiratory failure postallogeneic HCT. O-034 Hepatic Sinusoidal Obstruction Syndrome (SOS) in Children Undergoing Autologous Stem Cell Transplant (ASCT) Following High Dose Chemotherapy (HDCT) A Single Centre Experience from the UK N. Roy Moulik 1, L. Van Bruggen1, I. Johnson1, sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) or venoocclusive disease (VOD) is a serious complication of autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) with historically high mortality rate. Defibrotide has shown proven benefit in its treatment and has a modest role in prevention.We report our experience with SOS in paediatric ASCT. Design/Methods: Case records of 82 consecutive patients undergoing ASCT following HDCT between 2010 and 2017 were reviewed, relevant data were retrieved and analysed using conventional statistics. Defibrotide was used for treatment of all cases of SOS. It was available for prophylaxis of SOS in patients receiving busulfan based conditioning until 2014 due to funding issues. Results: Fourteen of the 82 children (17%) were diagnosed with SOS. The incidence was significantly higher in those receiving busulfan based conditioning (13/42 vs.1/40) (p=0.008).The mean time to diagnosis of SOS was 19\u00b15.6 days following stem cell rescue.Seven of 14 patients had bilirubin <34 micromoles/l and 3 had normal ultrasound. Coagulopathy was noted in 10 cases; 1 child developed multiorgan involvement. Nine children had mild SOS. Five cases had moderate or severe SOS, of which 4 needed PICU support. Patients with SOS had significantly delayed platelet recovery, higher transfusion requirement and longer hospital stay. The unavailability of defibrotide prophylaxis for 17/42 patients receiving busulfan post2014 did not significantly increase the incidence of SOS (6 /17 vs. 7/25; p=0.74). No significant difference in clinical course or severity was observed in 7 children who developed SOS despite defibrotide prophylaxis when compared to the 6 without it. No SOS related mortality was seen in either group. Conclusions: Hepatic SOS was more commonly seen in children receiving busulfan conditioning. Changing practice of not using defibrotide prophylaxis did not seem to increase the incidence or severity of SOS. Overall outcome was excellent with supportive care and treatment with defibrotide. O-035 Implementation of A Pediatric Early Warning System in Pediatric Patients Undergoing Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in Latin America P. Vergara 1, S. Saez1, J. 3St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Department of Global Pediatric Medicine, Memphis, USA Background/Objectives: Patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are at high risk for clinical deterioration due to their immunosuppression and expected complications. Pediatric Early Warning Systems (PEWS) are nursingadministered clinical acuity tools to aid with early identification of clinical deterioration in hospitalized patients. While these tools are commonly used in hospitals caring for HSCT patients in highresource settings, they have not previously been applied to HSCT patients hospitalized in Latin America. The objective of this study is to describe the implementation of PEWS in the HSCT Unit of Luis Calvo Mackenna Hospital (HLCM), a pediatric hospital in Santiago, Chile. Design/Methods: The PEWS used at Boston Children's Hospital, previously validated in HSCT patients, was modified at HLCM by a multidisciplinary team of physicians and nurses from the Oncology, BMT and Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) to adjust for practice variations between our hospitals. The modified PEWS was initially trialed as a onemonth pilot, and, after adjustments, implemented as a part of clinical practice in the unit. During this period, we analyzed compliance with PEWS documentation, error rates, abnormal (red) scores, and unplanned PICU transfers. Results: A total of 12 nurses, 12 nursing technicians, 3 staff physicians and 6 residents were trained in PEWS. Compliance with PEWS documentation was 89%, with an average of 37 PEWS calculated per day and 3.7% errors. The most common errors were interpretation of heart rate (38%) and oxygen use (36%). During 6 months of data collection, here were a total of 41 red PEWS among 8 patients, 3 of them required unplanned PICU transfer (37.5%). Conclusions: We describe the successful implementation of PEWS in a pediatric HSCT unit in Latin America with low error rates and appropriate identification of clinical deterioration. Sustainability of this program requires continuous reinforcement and monitoring to achieve 100% compliance. Free Paper Session: Solid Tumour Therapy O-036 Results from the UK Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group Study of Extracranial Germ Cell Tumours in Children and Adolescents (GC III) S. Depani 1, J. Nicholson2, S. Stoneham3, M. Krailo4, C. Xia5, J. Hale6 1University of Birmingham, Cancer Research UK Clinical Trials Unit Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, Birmingham, United Kingdom; 2University Cambridge Hospitals Oncology United Kingdom; 3University College London Hospitals NHS Trust, Children and Young Peoples Cancer Service, London, United Kingdom; 4University of Southern California, Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles CA, USA; 5Children's Oncology Group, Statistics and Data Center, Monrovia 6Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation and Haematology and Oncology, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: For extracranial malignant germ cell tumours (MGCT) in the UK, the GCII study used carboplatin and demonstrated equivalent survival to cisplatincontaining protocols. GCIII, a single arm observational study, used new risk stratification, replaced consolidation chemotherapy with standard number of cycles and introduced surveillance for all Stage 1 MGCTs with the aim of deescalating treatment where possible whilst maintaining excellent survival with the use of carboplatin. Design/Methods: Patients with a diagnosis of MGCT were stratified to three risk group low (LR), intermediate (IR), high (HR), using a combination of stage and prognostic factors. Patients with AFP >10,000U/L or Stage IV disease (except testis <5 and all germinomas) and Stage IIIV thoracic were classified as HR. Stage I tumours (LR) were monitored and received chemotherapy only if disease progressed. IR patients received 4 cycles of JEB (etoposide d2); HR patients received 6 cycles. Carboplatin dose was calculated to give an AUC of 7.9ml/m2.min. Results: Eightysix patients with MGCT were treated on the study between 2005 2009: 59% female, median age 5.7 years (0 - 17.5 years). Twentyfive (29%) were LR, 23 (27%) IR and 38 (44%) HR. Seven LR patients (28%) had disease progression at a median of 3 months; all were cured with chemotherapy. Five year eventfreesurvival for IR/HR patients was 90.2% (95% 96%; HR 95%). JEB was well tolerated with manageable toxicity. No patients developed significant oto or nephrotoxicity. There was no discernible difference in carboplatin dose whether calculated by body surfacearea or creatinine clearance. Conclusions: JEB chemotherapy using this risk stratification resulted in excellent survival with manageable toxicity. Carboplatin should be evaluated against cisplatin for paediatric GCTs in a large randomised prospective study. O-037 Treatment of Refractory Germ Cell Tumors in Children with Paclitaxel, Ifosfamide and Carboplatin: Results of the Children's Oncology F. 1, A. Pappo4, T. Olson5, C. RodriguezGalindo6 1Yale University School of Medicine, Pediatrics, New Haven, USA; 2Dana Farber Cancer Cancer Institute and Boston Children's Hospital, Pediatrics, Boston, USA; 3University of Southern California, Preventive Medicine, Los Angeles, USA; 4Saint Jude Children's Research Hospital, Pediatrics, Memphis, USA; 5Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Pediatrics, Atlanta, USA; 6Saint Jude Childrens Research Hospital, Global Pediatric Medicine, Memphis, USA Background/Objectives: Currently there is no standard regimen for relapsed pediatric malignant germ cell tumors (MGCT). In adults, a salvage regimen commonly used is TIP (paclitaxel, ifosfamide, cisplatin) which is associated with overall survival of 5070%. Further doses of cisplatin in young children, however, can be associated with significant short and long term toxicities. Because carboplatin has been shown to be effective in pediatric GCT with less toxicity, the TIP regimen was modified by substituting carboplatin for cisplatin. The primary aim was to evaluate response after 2 cycles of paclitaxel, ifosfamide, and carboplatin (TIC) in children with relapse or refractory MGCT. Design/Methods: This Phase II study, conducted by the Children's Oncology Group between November 2007 and June 2011, included children < 21y with relapsed or chemotherapyresistant MGCT, who had previously received a regimen containing cisplatin. \"TIC\" consists of paclitaxel 135 mg/m2/day Day 1, ifosfamide 1800 mg/m2/dose Days 15 and carboplatin AUC 6.5 Day 1. The endpoint of trial was response after 2 cycles. Results: 20 patients (12 male, median age 13.5 years) were enrolled. By RECIST criteria, 8 patients achieved a partial response (PR) during protocol therapy (response rate 40%), 10 patients had stable disease (SD) and 2 patients had progressive disease. Of the 8 patients with PR, all had elevated markers at enrollment (5 AFP, 2 B HCG, 1 both), and 6/8 patients (75%) had at least a 1 log reduction in tumor markers. Of the 10 patients with SD, 9 had elevated markers at enrollment (8 AFP, 1 BHCG), and 6/9 (67%) had at least 1 log decrease Conclusions: Evaluation after 2 cycles of TIC therapy indicates reasonable efficacy, particularly if one uses the metric of an appropriate AFP decline. Taxolbased regimens, either with carboplatin, as in this regimen or cisplatin, as in adult regimens, should be considered for salvage therapy in children O-038 Ovarian Yolk SAC Tumors: Does Age Matter? System, pediatry, New Haven, USA; 7University of Southern California, statistics, Los Angeles, USA; 8Riley Young Persons Cancer Services, pediatry, London, United Kingdom; 12Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, pediatry, Cambridge, United Kingdom; 13DanaFarber/Boston Childrens Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, pediatry, Boston, USA Background/Objectives: Whereas among pediatric oncologists, ovarian yolk sac tumor (OYST) is considered a chemo sensitive tumor, it is often cited as an adverse prognostic factor in adult women with ovarian germ cell tumors. Design/Methods: The MaGIC dataset included 6 pediatric clinical trials (United States, United Kingdom and France) and 2 adult gynecology clinical trials (United States). Any patient with an OYST that was FIGO Stage IC and treated with a platinumbased chemotherapy was eligible. Age was modeled as a continuous and a categorical variable (children: 010y; adolescents; 1117y and adults: 18y). In addition, analyses to establish the optimal cutpoint for age were conducted. Tumors were coded as pure YST (YST +/ teratoma), mixed YST (YST + other malignant germ cell component) or putative YST ('mixed' germ cell tumor + alphafetoprotein (AFP) >1000 were analyzed as covariates. Results: Two hundred fifty one patients (median age: 13 y, range 038) were identified (78 children, 139 adolescents and 34 adults). Histology was pure, mixed and putative in 129, 56 and 66 cases, respectively. Twenty six patients were Stage IV, similarly distributed in the 3 agegroups. Median follow up was 5.8 years. The overall 5year EFS and OS was 91% (95% CI, 87%94%) and 96% (92%98%), respectively. Age did not affect risk of event or death, modeled either as a categorical or continuous variable. Analysis failed to identify an age cutpoint that affected risk. None of the other covariates investigated had a prognostic impact on EFS or OS. Conclusions: OYST have an excellent outcome across all agegroups. Age has no apparent impact on the probability of event or death, allowing pediatric and gynecologic oncologist to enroll patients onto joint pediatric and adult trials. O-039 Pulmonary Nodule Size Measurements in Children with Wilms Tumours: Radiologists S. Olsen1 1Great Ormond Street Hospital for NHS Foundation Trust, Clinical Radiology, London, United Kingdom; 2University College Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health UCL London UK., Clinical Oncology, London, United Kingdom; 3APHP Armand Trousseau Hospital, Paediatric pulmonary metastases from Wilms tumours are allocated treatment regimens based upon lung lesion(s) size and response to chemotherapy. In the upcoming SIOPprotocol (UMBRELLA), chest CT will be used to measure lung lesions with thresholds of <3, 35, and >5 mm determining treatment intensity. This study aims to measure inter and intraobserver variability in the radiological assessment of pulmonary nodule size. Design/Methods: CT thoraces from 15 patients at diagnosis enrolled in the multicentre 'Improving Population Outcomes of Renal Tumours of childhood' (IMPORT) study were assessed. Five radiologists (3 chest, 2 paediatric) from different centres (4 UK, 1 Netherlands) assessed nodule size on two occasions, 6 months apart. Readers were blinded to patient symptoms and original radiology reports. Modified Bland Altman graphs were created to measure inter and intraobserver limits of agreement for the nodules detected by all readers. Results: 93 different nodules were seen by at least one reader on both of their individual assessments of the same scan 6 months apart. Only 14 nodules were seen by all readers at both assessments. Of these, interobserver limits of agreement (in millimetres) for the 5 readers were \u00b12.0 and \u00b11.7 (anteroposterior \u00b12.0 and \u00b11.9 (craniocaudal distance) at assessments 1 and 2, respectively. Intraobserver mean differences in measurement and limits of agreement across the three dimensions were 0.1 \u00b11.5mm, 0.2 \u00b12.1mm, 0.3 \u00b11.7mm, 0.3\u00b1 2.4mm, and 0.1 \u00b12.5mm (readers 15, respectively). Applying UMBRELLA criteria, only seven patients ( 45%) would be allocated to the same treatment arm across all radiology assessments. Conclusions: The demonstrated intra and interobserver variability of detection and measurement of pulmonary nodules on CT thorax has important implications for the diagnosis and risk stratified treatment of metastatic disease. O-040 Clinicopathological Study on the Sensitivity and Specificity of Indocyanine Green Fluorescent Imaging Test in the Pulmonary Metastases Resections of Hepatoblastoma M. Yoshida 1, Yokohama, Japan; 3Kanagawa & hepatoblastoma using indocyanine green fluorescent imaging (ICG) is effective for lesions that cannot be detected by CT or are nonpalpable during operations. However, the detailed evaluation of the sensitivity and specificity of ICG tests was insufficient. Design/Methods: The subjects were 378 specimens submitted to the pathology department as pulmonary metastatic lesions of hepatoblastoma that were resected using ICG imaging tests in Kanagawa Children's Medical Center from January 2013 to March 2017. In total, there were 61 operations for 16 cases. By collating operation records and pathological reports, we studied the sensitivity and specificity of the ICG tests. Results: Among 378 specimens, 4 specimens were falsenegative (ICGnegative and tumorpositive), and the sensitivity of the ICG tests was 0.98. There were also 112 falsepositive specimens (ICGpositive and tumornegative) with a specificity of 0.018 and a positive predictive value of 0.70. All the falsenegative specimens were resected from the same case. In falsepositive specimens, as far as operation records could confirm, the ICGpositive regions were generally smaller than 2 mm in diameter. Even if the ICGpositive regions were relatively wide, the ICG uptake patterns were weak, heterogeneous, and poorly marginated. Microscopically, falsepositive specimens often contained necrosis, fibrosis, inflammatory cells, hemorrhage, thrombus, and/or unspecified mesenchymal tissue, which sometimes suggests the presence of preceding metastatic lesions. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that ICG tests had high sensitivity but occasionally yielded falsenegative specimens. The specificity was low, but falsepositive specimens showed relatively uniform ICG uptake patterns by which the absence of viable tumors was predictable. These findings suggested high ICG test reliability as a technique to detect pulmonary metastases when considering high sensitivity to be more important. Closer communication between surgeons and pathologists about the ICG uptake patterns of the specimens might improve the usefulness of these tests. O-041 Intensive MultiModality Therapy for ExtraOcular Retinoblastoma Children's Medical Center, Pediatrics, Fort Worth, USA; 9Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Pediatrics, Los Angeles, USA; 10Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Pharmacy, New York, Children's Hospital, Pediatrics, Chicago, USA; Ophthalmology, New York, Children's Research Hospital, Pediatrics, Memphis, USA; 14Texas Children's Cancer Center, Pediatrics, Houston, USA Background/Objectives: Metastatic RB is associated with a poor prognosis. COG opened this prospective, multiinstitutional, international trial to study whether intensified systemic chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy (RT) would improve outcomes in this population. Design/Methods: Patients with regional extraocular RB (stage 2 or 3) received 4 cycles of chemotherapy (vincristine 0.05 mg/kg/day, cisplatin 3.5 mg/kg/day, cyclophosphamide 65 mg/kg x 2 days, etoposide 4 mg/kg x 2 days) followed by involvedfield RT (4,500 cGy). Two strata of patients with metastatic RB [stage 4a: no central stage 4b: CNS metastases/trilateral RB)] also received 4 cycles of chemotherapy. Patients with partial response then received 1 cycle of highdose carboplatin (Calvert formula with AUC=7/day, maximum 16.7 mg/kg/day) on days 8 to 6, thiotepa (10 mg/kg/day), & etoposide (8.3 mg/kg/day) on days 5 to 3 with autologous hematopoietic stem cell rescue on day 0. Patients with metastatic RB who achieved an inadequate response to chemotherapy received RT. Results: Sixty subjects (20 in each stratum) were enrolled; 57 eligible were included in the analyses (data current to 63016). Toxicity was significant as expected and included 2 therapy related deaths. Eventfree survival (EFS) at 36 months was 87.7% (90% CI 65.4 to 96.0%) for subjects with stage 2 or 3 disease, 79.3% (90% CI 54.2 to 91.6%) for subjects with stage 4a disease and 8.0% (90% CI 1.0 to 25.1%) for subjects with stage 4b/trilateral disease. The observed results significantly improved the EFS in each stratum compared with historical results used for planning the study. Conclusions: Intensive multimodality therapy is highly effective for patients with regional extraocular RB and metastatic RB not involving the CNS. More effective therapy is required for patients with CNS RB. Free Paper Session: Brain Tumours II O-042 Proteogenomic Approach Discriminates Pediatric and Adult Pilocytic Astrocytoma as Distinct Biological Entities D. Picard1,2,3, J. Felsberg3, Langini4,5, D. Pauck1,2,3, 1,2,3 Cancer Consortium DKTK and German DKFZ, Department of Pediatric NeuroOncogenomics, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany; 2Hematology and Clinical Immunology Medical of Pediatric Oncology, Dusseldorf, Germany; 3Heinrich Lisbon, Portugal Background/Objectives: Pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) comprise the most common primary brain tumor in childhood. Genomewide profiling and nextgeneration sequencing studies point towards a singlepathway disease with oncogenic activation of MAPK signaling, typically driven by BRAF alterations. Incompletely resected tumors recur frequently despite radiation and/or chemotherapy. Less favorable therapeutic responses are observed in adults compared their pediatric counterparts. Thus, we utilized a proteogenomic approach to reveal the biological heterogeneity of PA across all agegroups to identify novel therapeutic targets. Design/Methods: Our proteogenomic approach encompasses RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and LC/MSbased proteomic profiling in pediatric (n=55) patients (n=24) with PA. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering (HCL) analyses were applied to determine the biological heterogeneity of the disease. Integrative genomics combined with downstream pathway analysis were used to identify specific pathway activation in biological subgroups. Lastly, we performed highthroughput drug screening encompassing conventional chemotherapeutics and targeted therapeutics (n=211) currently evaluated in phase III and IV clinical trials to validate novel molecular targets in PA primary culture models (n=8). Results: Pediatric and adult PA segregate into two main subgroups identified by unsupervised HCL using RNAseq and proteomic profiling (p=0.001). Adult tumors form a single entity, while we observed additional heterogeneity in pediatric tumors segregating into two subgroups (p=0.01). Initial analyses show that adult PA display an overrepresentation of factors involved in translation initiation and ciliogenesis according to GeneSet Enrichment Analysis, whereas pediatric PA show a significant enrichment of pathways involved in glycolysis, signal transmission and AKT signaling. Conclusions: In all, our proteogenomic approach reveals clear biological heterogeneity in pediatric and adult PA. Ongoing drug screening experiments are used to determine therapeutics with preferential activity against pediatric and adult PA cultures. These biological insights may improve biological stratification and reveal novel therapeutic targets specifically useful for nonresectable tumors with high risk of progressive disease. O-043 Genomic Landscape of the First 100 Tumors Registered in the Biological Medicine for Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (BIOMEDE) Trial J. Grill 1, M.A. Debily2, D. E. Barret3, S. Picot3, A. genomics has been so far mostly done on autopsy samples and in restrospective studies. In the frame of the BIOMEDE randomized trial of three targeted therapies (erlotinib, on three biomarkers identification systematic whole exome and RNA sequencing of stereotactic biopsies performed at diagnosis was implemented to inform the results of the trial and define additional targets that could be used to guide therapy at relapse. Design/Methods: The results of the first 100 patients from France, Danemark and Belgium are presented. Seventyfive percents of the samples could be profiled for DNA & RNA, no frozen material was available for 6% of the tumors and only one sample was not contributive. Results: All tumor samples but one included in the study on the basis of histology showed a loss of H3K27 trimethylation. With respect to histone H3K27M mutation, 75% of the samples were mutated in the H3F3A gene, 17% in the HIST1H3B gene and 8% were wildtype. Structural copy number aberrations were only found in TP53 mutated samples. Gain of chromosome 1q and whole chromosome 2 were more frequent in the HIST1H3BK27M mutated samples. Translocations were rarely identified and none was recurrent. ACVR1 mutations were almost exclusively found in HIST1H3BK27M mutated samples but two in histone H3 wt samples and one in a H3F3AK27M mutated sample. 75% of H3F3AK27M DIPG had either a TP53 or a PPM1D mutation while no of the HIST1H3BK27M DIPG had a mutation in the TP53 pathway. Recetors TyrosineKinase mutations or amplifications were only found in H3F3AK27M DIPG. Conclusions: This study refines the description of the differences in the subtypes of DIPG and may support specific treatment adaptations with respect to potential biomarkers.

Bowers4, Bendel5, Hospital, Memphis, Children's Research Developmental Research Center DKFZ, Applied Bioinformatics, Heidelberg, Germany; 4University of Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Dallas, USA; 5Children's Hospitals and Clinics of Pediatric Hematology and Minneapolis, USA; 6Stanford for Sick Children, Haematology and Oncology, Toronto, Canada; 11The Hospital for Sick Children, Neurosurgery, Toronto, Canada; 12St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Radiation DKFZ, Pediatric Neurooncology, Heidelberg, Germany; 14St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Pathology, Memphis, USA Background/Objectives: Survival of children 5 yearsold (called \"infants\") with medulloblastoma (MB) is vastly inferior to that of older children with MB. The difference is principally due to radiationsparing therapy, however, radiation is not a requisite for survival in all. Therefore it is imperative to understand which infants benefit and which fail current approaches. Herein we comprehensively describe the molecular landscape of the infantile medulloblastoma (iMB) and show that differences in molecular makeup translate to major differences in outcome. Design/Methods: We amassed a discovery cohort of 165 and a validation cohort of 73 iMB. All were analyzed on 450K DNA methylation arrays and sequenced against matched normal. The discovery cohort came from a pooled international series and the validation from the SJYC07 clinical trial (NCT00602667). Results: three subgroups; SHH, G3, G4. No WNT MB was observed. Distribution between the 2 cohorts were similar - Discovery 2%) are rare. NonSHHMB displayed relatively few recurrent mutations but exhibited multiple large copy number aberrations. In the validation cohort, fouryear progression free survival of SHHMB is to (54%\u00b19 vs 10%\u00b110 p value <0.0001). Histology and metastatic disease within subgroups were not prognostic for PFS. Ongoing analysis is occurring to determine if any molecular heterogeneity within subgroups is prognostic. Conclusions: Infant SHHMB benefits more from radiationsparing therapy than nonSHHMB. Future clinical trials need to prospectively divide into SHHMB and nonSHHMB. The therapeutic goals need to shift towards optimizing the current chemotherapeutic backbone for SHHMB, while a paradigm shift in therapy for infant nonSHHMB is necessary. O-045 Who is Who?

In a cohort of patients with a previous diagnosis of CNSPNET, new entities with recurrent genetic alterations were delineated, which were then also identified in patients with previous other diagnoses (Sturm,2016). Utility of current treatment paradigms in confined diagnostic groups is not known. Design/Methods: Through an international collaboration, additional tumor samples of patients with a previous diagnosis of CNSPNET were reevaluated by DNA methylation profiling and blinded neuropathological panel review. Clinical data to the newly reevaluated cases and to previously published cases, irrespective of historic diagnosis, were pooled and analyzed. Results: The given numbers represent preliminary data of the ongoing project. DNA methylation profile classified 173 newly reevaluated tumors with historic CNSPNET diagnosis as: overlapped with methylation result for 18 correspondingly analyzed ETMR, and a group of embryonal tumors displaying varying degrees of neuronal and ganglionic differentiation corresponded to 12 CNSNBFOXR2. In the combined data set, historic diagnosis other than CNSPNET was uncommon in CNSNBFOXR2 (1 of 59, 2%), but was common in CNSHGNETBCOR (28 of 48, 58%), CNSHGNETMN1 (34 of 51, 67%, mostly diagnosed as astroblastoma, ependymoma), and CNSEFTCIC (5 of 22, 23%). Fiveyear PFS and OS was 60% and 95%, respectively, for 31 patients with CNSNBFOXR2, 0% and 40% for 16 patients with CNSHGNETBCOR, 27% and 94% for 21 patients with CNSHGNETMN1, and 50% and 51% for 11 patients with CNSEFTCIC methylation profile. Conclusions: Consensus on diagnostic criteria and treatment strategy is needed. International collaboration will aim for prospective molecular and clinical data collection to inform the development of specific trials e.g. for controlled deescalation of treatment for CNSNBFOXR2. O-046 Molecular Subgrouping of Pineal Tumors Reveals Distinct Classes Correlated with Clinical Parameters and Genetic Alterations E. Pfaff University Hospital, & Heidelberg, Germany; 3NYU Neuropathology, York, USA; 4NYU Langone Medical Center, Department of Neurology, New York, USA; 5NYU Langone Medical Center, Laura and Isaac Perlmutter Cancer Center, New York, USA; 6Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Department of Pediatrics, New York, USA Background/Objectives: Tumors of the pineal region comprise several different entities with distinct clinical and histopathological features. Pineocytoma (PC, WHO grade I), pineal parenchymal tumors of intermediate differentiation (PPTID) and papillary tumors of the pineal region (PTPR) (WHO grade IIIII), predominantly affect adults and are associated with a favorable prognosis. Pineoblastoma (PB) is a highly aggressive tumor (WHO grade IV) in the family of primitive embryonal tumors/PNET occurring in infants, children and adolescents. Especially for infants and patients with metastatic disease, the outcome is poor despite aggressive multimodal treatment, and no therapeutically actionable molecular targets have been identified to date. Whereas most PB arise sporadically, cancer predisposition syndromes including DICER1 or RB1 germline mutations are associated with PB, the latter in the context of trilateral retinoblastoma (PBRB). We investigated the biological relationships between clinicopathological entities of pineal tumors based on DNA methylation and copy number analysis. Design/Methods: We performed genomewide DNA methylation profiling in 230 pineal tumors and normal pineal tissue controls, including copynumber analysis. Results: Unsupervised clustering revealed clear separation of the known entities (PC, PTPR, PPTID and PBRB). Within these groups, distinct subgroups could be distinguished, including the previously hypothesized PTPRA and PTPRB groups. Interestingly, the tumors initially diagnosed as either PB or pineal PNET formed a number of biologically discrete subgroups, which are now being further characterized. One group harbored recurrent alterations of DROSHA, an endoribonuclease involved in miRNA processing upstream of DICER1, implicating a central role of altered miRNA biogenesis in the development of PB. Conclusions: Using methylation profiling, we identified biologically distinct subgroups of pineal tumors, including novel subclusters. Our findings provide a foundation for further molecular and functional characterization, including the role of miRNA processing defects in oncogenesis. O-047 Improved Survival and Decreasing Neurocognitive Function Over Time in Posterior Fossa Ependymoma M. V. 1The Children, Pediatrics/ Division of Hematology/Oncology, Toronto, Canada; 2Princess Margaret Hospital, Radiation Oncology, Toronto, Canada Background/Objectives: Intracranial ependymoma is third most frequent pediatric brain tumor comprising of distinct biological entities arising in posterior fossa (PF) or supratentorial (ST) region. We aimed to identify predictors of survival and neurocognitive outcome in a large consecutive cohort over three decades. Design/Methods: Data on demographics, treatment, survival and neurocognitive functioning were collected in 102 consecutive patients with intracranial ependymoma diagnosed at SickKids from 19852014. Results: No significant difference between survival of (GTR) (p=0.037) and upfront radiotherapy (p<0.0001). Analysis of consecutive 10 year epochs revealed a significant improvement in PFS and OS over time (20052014 compared to 19851994 and 19952004). This pertains to the rate of GTR increased from 35% to 77% and use of upfront radiation increased from 65% to 96% over observed period in PF ependymoma. None of observed variables were prognostic in ST ependymoma. The proportion of patients with recurrent ependymoma who can be salvaged with reirradiation increases from 0% to resection recurrence is a strong favourable predictor of survival (p=0.005). Upfront radiation in primary diagnosis or reirradiation at recurrence significantly influences neurocognitive outcome, especially in very young children. Conclusions: Data from our large homogeneously treated cohort clearly indicate improved survival of posterior fossa ependymoma over time, related to more aggressive surgery and upfront radiation. However for the first time in a large consecutive cohort, we show that this approach results in reduced neurocognitive outcomes over time. Our data suggests that all children with posterior fossa ependymoma should receive upfront radiation and be concomitantly prioritized for early neuropsychological testing and intervention. Free Paper Session: Leukemia Biology O-048 Integrated Genetic and Epigenetic Analysis in Pediatric TCell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (TALL) S. 1,2, Pediatrics, Tokyo, Japan; 2Hiroshima University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Pediatrics, Hiroshima, Japan; 3National Center for Child Health and Development, MaternalFetal Biology, Tokyo, Japan; 4Graduate School of Medicine Kyoto University, Pathology and Tumor Biology, Kyoto, Japan; 5National Center for Child Health and Development, Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Tokyo, Japan; 6Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine Graduate School of Medical Science, Pediatrics, Kyoto, Japan; 7Saitama Children's Medical Center, Hematology/Oncology, Tokyo, Japan; 9Toho University, Pediatrics, Tokyo, Japan; 10National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Clinical Research Center, Japan; 11Gunma Children's Medical Center, Hematology/Oncology, Shibukawa, Japan; 12Institute of Medical Science The University of Tokyo, Laboratory of DNA Information Analysis Human Genome Center, Tokyo, Japan Background/Objectives: Pediatric Tcell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (TALL) is an aggressive hematologiccancer. Although genetic basis of pediatric TALL has been well characterized, no comprehensive study has yet explored the epigenetic profiles and their potential contribution to clinicopathological features of TALL. Design/Methods: To describe epigenetic landscape of TALL, we conducted methylation array analysis using Illumina HumanMethylationEPIC array, whole transcriptome sequencing (WTS), and targetedcapture sequencing for 158 ALLrelated genes in a cohort of 49 cases with TALL. Following analyses were performed using R (v3.3.0). Results: After normalization, 2975 probes were selected to identify the most variable methylated probes, when a standard deviation of the betavalues across the samples was above 0.35. Unsupervised consensus clustering using selected 2975 probes clearly identified 3 distinct sample clusters. Combined analyses with expression and fusion data from WTS revealed that these 3 clusters were characterized by TAL1 fusions/highexpression (M1 cluster; the number of frequently affected genes (>15%) was relatively low in M3 cluster, PTEN and USP7 abnormalities were particularly enriched in M1 cluster and PHF6, DNM2, and EZH2 mutations were frequently observed in M2 cluster. Furthermore, it should be noted that, patients in M3 cluster displayed adverse prognosis, whereas patients in M2 cluster showed excellent clinical outcome (LogRank p = 0.02). Conclusions: Based on the DNA methylation profiles, pediatric TALL is clustered into 3 distinct subtypes, which exhibited remarkable correlation with fusion gene status, gene expression patterns, genetic signatures, and clinical outcomes. Although our cohort in the current study is very limited, our results suggested that the biological phenotype of TALL is mediated by both genetic and epigenetic regulations. Therefore, explorations for aberrant DNA methylation along with genetic alterations might be helpful for development a new therapeutic strategy for TALL. O-049 Genomic Breakpoint and Fusion Transcript Analysis of KMT2A Rearrangement in Infant Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia E. Guest 1, B. Yoo2, M. Farooqi2, N. Miller2, J. Johnston2, P. Hospital, Hematology/Oncology/Bone Marrow Transplantation, Kansas City, USA; 2Children's Mercy Hospital, Center for Pediatric Genomic Medicine, Kansas City, USA; 3Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Biostatistics, Baltimore, USA; 4Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Pediatric Oncology, Baltimore, USA Background/Objectives: Rearrangement of KMT2A (KMT2AR) is a high risk, recurrent molecular driver of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) among infants less than 1 year of age. We sought to determine if variation in the genomic breakpoints of KMT2A and its partner genes correlates with risk of treatment failure for infants with ALL. Design/Methods: We performed whole genome sequencing (WGS) to an average depth of 30x, and mRNA sequencing on 47 blood and marrow samples from 32 infants with KMT2AR ALL. The infants were enrolled on the Children's Oncology Group trial AALL0631. Cases with the partner genes AF4 (n=19)or ENL (n=13) were selected for study. Twentyone infants had experienced treatment failure, and 13 had paired relapse samples. Alignment of sequencing data was done using BWA. Translocation detection (WGS) was done using Manta, and fusion transcript detection (RNAseq) was performed using FusionCatcher. Whole genome sequencing detected the KMT2A samples and the precise nucleotide breakpoint in 82% of samples. The location of KMT2A breakage was within introns 8, 9, or 10, or exons 10 or 11 in all cases. In contrast, the breakpoint locations within AF4 and ENL were more variable. Relapses were observed in both AF4 and ENL groups and the breakpoints were unchanged in paired samples at relapse. Known fusion transcripts were detected in 76% of samples and were biologically consistent with identified DNA breakpoints. Exon skipping and alternative splice sites were observed. The reciprocal fusion transcript was frequently detected for AF4, but never detected for ENL. Fusion of KMT2Aexon9 was dominant, detected in 17 cases with relapse and only 3 without relapse. Conclusions: The breakpoints of KMT2A in infant ALL are conserved within a narrow genomic window, in contrast to the breakpoints of partner genes AF4 and ENL. Fusion of KMT2Aexon9 is common among cases with relapse. O-050 Identification by RTPCR Multiplex of Key Partners of KMT2A in Pediatric Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia I. Cezar 1, F. Andrade1, M. PombodeOliveira1 1Instituto Nacional do Cancer, Paediatric HaematologyOncology Program, RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil Background/Objectives: Pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (pAML) is a phenotypic and genetically heterogeneous disease. The identification of gene fusion allows the definition of molecular subtypes in pAML, with an important role in the prognosis and followup of the treatment response. In earlyage AML the majority of genomic abnormality is characterized by KMT2A rearrangements (KMT2Ar) identified by FISH MLL break apart. The KMT2A partners gene defines the prognosis outcome. In this context, we standardized the multiplex RTPCR (mRTPCR) technique to identify the most frequent MLLT4, MLLT10, AFF1 the KMT2A gene. Design/Methods: It was analyzed 241 cases of de novo pAML, for the identification ofKMT2Ar through the mRTPCR identifying all partners studied in the same PCR reaction. In order to standardized the method described by Burmeister et al, 2014 some modification was necessary, as reagent changes were performed, including tests of Taq DNA Polymerase and changes in cycles program. Sanger sequencing was performed to confirm the results. Results: Two hundred and fortyone AML cases were included in the study and about 22% were infants (52 cases); The most frequent myelomonocytic cases with KMT2Ar were identified by mRTPCR. Partners were identified in the following frequencies: 5/33(15.2%) with KMT2AMLLT1 fusion, and 3/33 (9.1%) presented KMT2APTD. Conclusions: The proposed technique was successfully standardized in our laboratory and it is possible reliable in the identification of KMT2A with the partner gene and with less cost compared with FISH. O-051 Identification of Genetic Aberrations Predisposing to De Wilde1, T. Lammens1, G. Laureys 1 1Ghent University Hospital, Department of Pediatric HematologyOncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Ghent, Belgium Background/Objectives: Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is a rare pediatric tumor characterized by the translocation of MYC on chromosome 8 to one of the immunoglobulin loci. Since exposure time to carcinogenics is shorter in children, genetic factors are assumed to be more important in tumor development. At our department, 2 related children were diagnosed with BL, strongly suggesting a predisposing factor. Design/Methods: Whole genome sequencing was performed on constitutional material from both patients, parents and grandparents (n=10). Variant calling using genome analysis toolkit (GATK) was followed by prioritization filtering with GEMINI (Paila et al., 2013). Results: At first, data reduction was done through selecting rare variants (< 1% in 1000G_EUR) shared by the patients and the related parents and absent in spousal controls. Three deleterious variants were identified including 1 in USP28 (rs45570432) and 2 in MAP2K3 (rs56067280 and rs55796947). Data reduction based on inheritance modeling revealed a compound heterozygous variation in C4orf33. In addition, 13 mutations followed a de novo model of which, based on the probability of mendelian error, the noncoding mutations in USP32 and DRD3 seem most plausible. In a third approach, using a published cancer gene panel (Zhang et al., 2015), 14 noncoding variants were found segregating in the family. Conclusions: Collectively, these data show that multiple candidate BL predisposing variants can be found in the family under investigation. It is becoming more apparent that noncoding variants play a major role in the development of cancer through up or downregulating expression, altering splicesites and gene silencing. The identified variants, however, need functional validation and further examination in large populations and other families. Importantly, this approach can be expanded to other pediatric cancer entities to improve our understanding of tumorigenesis, to enable genetic counseling and to contribute to novel diagnostic applications and therapeutic options. * TL and GL are shared senior authors Free Paper Session: Neuroblastoma Clinical O-052 Neuroblastoma Stage 4S: Regression Rate and Patients at Risk M. Tas 1, M. Nagtegaal2, K. Kraal1, G. Tytgat1,2, N. Abeling3, Pediatric Oncology, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; 3Academic Medical Center, Laboratory for Genetic Metabolic Diseases, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; 4Erasmus Pediatric Research, Utrecht, The Netherlands Background/Objectives: Neuroblastoma stage 4S/MS is a low risk tumor with an overall survival of 6592%. The natural course consists of initial growth of multifocal disease followed by regression. However, the precise clinical course of the initial growth and regressive phase is poorly described. We performed a retrospective cohort study to describe the clinical course, to identify patients at risk of an adverse outcome and to compare regression rate between treated and untreated patients. Design/Methods: Charts of all patients diagnosed with neuroblastoma stage 4S/MS between 1972 and 2012 in two Dutch oncology centers were evaluated for therapy, response, outcome and for clinical, metabolic and radiological regression of tumor and liver metastases. Patients with high risk criteria were excluded. Results: We identified 31 patients. The 5 year overall survival was 84% (median follow up 193.5 months, range 40468). Treatment was given to 55% of the patients. In the first 3 weeks after diagnosis 4 patients died of rapid liver growth and compression. Neonates were at highest risk of dying: 4/7 (58%) neonates died, while none of the older patients died. During the regressive phase, the primary tumor completely regressed in 69% of the patients after a median of 13 months (range 673); liver size normalized in 91% after a median of 2 months (range 0131), and architecture normalized in 52% after a median of 14.5 months (range 5131). No differences in regression rate were seen between the treated and untreated patients. Late progression to stage 4 was observed in 3 patients, all had persistent elevated catecholamines. Two of three are currently in complete remission. Conclusions: Neonates are at risk of dying of rapid liver growth. Patients with persistent elevated catecholamines are at risk of progression to stage 4. Radiological regression of primary tumor and liver architecture is slow and takes over 12 months. O-053 I131MetaIodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) Therapy Improves Survival in HighRisk Neuroblastoma Patients with MIBG Positive Residual Metastatic Disease T. Simon 1, M. Schmidt2, B. Decarolis1, A. Eggert3, F. Berthold1, B. Oncology and Hematology, of Cologne, Nuclear Germany; Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Berlin, Randomized trials on mIBG therapy in the firstline treatment of highrisk neuroblastoma are not available. Therefore, we analyzed the national neuroblastoma data base on the impact of I131metaiodobenzylguanidine (mIBG) therapy, local radiotherapy, and single firstline therapy highrisk neuroblastoma. Design/Methods: Patients of two consecutive national neuroblastoma trials were included if they met all key criteria: (1) stage 4 neuroblastoma, (2) age at diagnosis >18 months, (3) N5/N6 induction chemotherapy, (4) diagnosis between 1997 and 2014. mIBG therapy prior to the myeloablative chemotherapy was scheduled for nonprogressing mIBG positive lesions. Local radiotherapy 3640 Gy was delivered to unresectable mIBG positive residual at the primary site. Single agent ch14.18 immunotherapy was stratified according to open trials. Results: A total of 264 patients were included. The median observation time was 8.9 years. The presence of mIBG positive metastases at the end of induction chemotherapy was associated with inferior EFS (5yEFS 29.0+/4.5% vs 41.3+/4.1%, p=0.049). It had no impact on OS (5yOS 49.7+/5.1% vs 51.2+/4.2%, p=0.655). Among 108 patients with residual MIBG positive metastatic disease the EFS was similar between patients who underwent mIBG therapy (5yEFS 31.8+/6.3%) and patients who did not (5yEFS 25.2+/6.4%, p=0.238). The OS was better after mIBG to no mIBG therapy (5yEFS 37.7+/7.2%, p=0.038). Multivariable analysis of all 264 patients including the variables MYCN, mIBG therapy, local radiotherapy, and immunotherapy with ch14.18 impact hr 1.445) and on OS. Conclusions: mIBG therapy can improve the outcome of highrisk neuroblastoma patients with incomplete metastatic response to induction chemotherapy. These results warrant a prospective multicenter trial on mIBG therapy. In addition, this analysis confirmed the long term effect of immunotherapy with ch14.18. O-054 Thrombocytopenia in MIBGTreated Patients May be Prevented by the Concomitant Administration of a Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor T. Blom 1, M. Hansen2, Van der Schoot4, L. Tytgat5 1Princess M\u00e1xima Center Pediatric Oncology, Experimental Immunohematology, Amsterdam, Netherlands; 5Princess M\u00e1xima Pediatric Oncology, Pediatric oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands Background/Objectives: Thrombocytopenia is the major toxicity of metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG)therapy. Whether this is caused by the wholebodyabsorbed radiation dose or by other mechanisms is not clear. We previously showed that MIBG is transported via the serotonin transporter (SERT) in platelets and via the NET in neuroblastoma. We tested if selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) inhibit MIBG accumulation in platelets, with no effect on MIBG accumulation in neuroblastoma in a mouse model. Design/Methods: The uptake of [125I]MIBG and [3H]serotonin in isolated human platelets was inhibited by a panel of SSRIs. MIBG uptake in platelets (presumably via SERT) was compared to uptake in SKNSH neuroblastoma cells (via NET). The IC50 (i.e. the inhibitor concentration that reduces the uptake by 50%) and the selectivity (IC50 ratio of MIBG uptake in neuroblastoma cells over that in platelets) were calculated. MIBG tumor accumulation with and without SSRI's and NET inhibitors was studied in neuroblastoma xenografts. SSRI containing plasma of nude mice was used to test the inhibitory potency on MIBG uptake in human platelets (ex vivo). Results: Inhibition of serotonin and MIBG uptake in platelets appeared comparable for the SSRIs suggesting that both substrates share the same transport system. SSRIs were 40100 times more potent in inhibiting platelet MIBG uptake than in neuroblastoma cells. Imipramine, a classical tricyclic antidepressant, showed no selectivity and inhibited the MIBG platelet and MIBG neuroblastoma uptake to the same extent. MIBG accumulation in neuroblastoma xenografts was not significantly affected by SSRI administration, but was 60% diminished in mice treated with desipramine (NET inhibitor). SSRI drug levels in the murine circulation highly exceeded those required for effective inhibition of platelet MIBG uptake. Conclusions: SSRIs are effective in reducing MIBG uptake in platelets while leaving the tumor loading unaffected. Administration of SSRIs may prevent MIBG related thrombocytopenia if similar mechanisms are involved in megakaryocytes. O-055 Feasibility and Toxicity of Busulfan and Melphalan Conditioning Regimen in the Context of the German Induction Chemotherapy B. Hero 1, T. Simon1, H. Lode2, A. Eggert3, F. Berthold1 Highdose chemotherapy with autologous stemcell rescue is considered standard in the treatment of high risk neuroblastoma patients. A randomized trial recently showed improved outcome with a regimen using busulfan and melphalan (Ladenstein et al., Lancet Oncol, 2017). Per protocol, highdose chemotherapy in trials of the German neuroblastoma group (GPOH) consisted of melphalan, etoposide, and carboplatin (MEC). in patients with contraindications (e.g. ototoxicity), busulfan and melphalan was recommended as an alternative. Here, we evaluated the feasibility and toxicity of busulfan and melphalan in patients treated with the GPOH induction treatment using longtime infusion of cisplatin, etoposide, and ifosfamid. Design/Methods: Data of high risk neuroblastoma patients registered in the German neuroblastoma trials NB97 and NB2004HR and receiving highdose chemotherapy with autologous stemcell rescue in first line treatment were analyzed. Results: Highdose chemotherapy with melphalan, etoposide, and carboplatin (MEC) was given to 459 patients, while 79 patients received busulfan and melphalan (BuMel). mIBG therapy was applied to 135 patients receiving MEC and to nine patients receiving BuMel in median 17 resp. 19 days prior to high dose chemotherapy. Hematologic recovery was not different between groups (median leukocyte take in both cohorts: 11 days, platelet take: 17 (MEC) vs. 18 days (BuMel, n.s.)). Detailed toxicity data were available in 371 patients (MEC: n=322; BuMel: n=49) revealing no significant difference in toxicity grade 3 or 4 for fever, infection, stomatitis, or liver enzymes. Venoocclusive disease (VOD) was reported in 4.8% after MEC, but in 21.5% after BuMel. Sixteen out of 459 patients (3.5%) receiving MEC and three out of 79 (3.8%) receiving BuMel died from high dose chemotherapy related complications (n.s.) including in six after the GPOH induction treatment. As expected, VOD was observed more often, but otherwise, the toxicity was comparable. Free Paper Session: Bone Tumours Nollenburg Prize O-056 Pathological Fractures and Prognosis of HighGrade Osteosarcoma of the Extremities in Adoloscents and Young Adults. An Analysis of 1,299 Cooperative Osteosarcoma Study Group (COSS) Patients L. Kelley 1, M. Schlegel1, S. HeckerNolting2, C. R\u00f6ssig3, P. Reichardt4, Center and Research Consortium DKTK, Department of Kassel, Germany Background/Objectives: The objective of this study was to investigate the age group of Adolescents and Young Adults (AYAs) regarding correlations between pathological fractures (PFs) and prognosis of patients with primary central highgrade osteosarcoma of the extremities. Design/Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 1,299 patients ages 15 to 29 with localized or metastatic primary central highgrade osteosarcoma of the extremities, treated between 1980 and 2010 and registered into the COSSdatabase. Intended treatment included pre and postoperative chemotherapy and surgery. Univariate survival analysis was performed with KaplanMeierAnalysis and compared with LogRankTest. Multivariate survival analysis was conducted with Cox's proportional hazards model. Results: Out of 1,299 patients, 97 (7.5%) had documented PFs. Presence of PF correlated with younger age (P=0.040), tumor site (P<0.001), localization within the affected bone (P<0.001), histological subtype (P<0.001) and relative tumor size (P=0.001), but not with sex, body mass index, primary metastases, type of operation, local surgical remission or response to chemotherapy. In univariate survival analysis, 5year overall survival (OAS) of patients with and without PF was 61% vs. 71%, respectively (P=0.049). multivariate Cox analysis, PF resulted as an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (P=0.028) with a hazard LRFS (P=0.023; HR=1.556, did not result prognostic factor for EFS (P=0.646; HR=1.090, 95%CI: 0.755-1.572). Conclusions: We observed the presence of to correlate with inferior OAS and LRFS, with PF remaining as an independent prognostic factor in multivariable analysis. Our survival analyses suggest that local recurrence might be more common in patients with PF. Therefore further analysis is needed to exclude other influencing factors. However, the presence of PF does not seem to influence the type of operation performed. O-057 Development of a Standardized System for Measuring ValueBased Healthcare in Osteosarcoma at Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt R. Soliman1, M. Zamzam 2, W. Eweida3, S. Abouelnaga4 1Children's Cancer Hospital 57357 Egypt, Health Economics and Outcomes, Cairo, Egypt; 2Children's Cancer Hospital 57357 Egypt, Pediatric Oncology, Cairo, Egypt; 3Children's Cancer Hospital 57357 Egypt, Chief Operating Office, Cairo, Egypt; 4Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt, Chief Executive Office, Cairo, Egypt Background/Objectives: Valuebased healthcare is crucial for medical conditions that have failed to improve outcomes such as Osteosarcoma. Aim of work was to develop a standardized system to measure the value of health care delivered to Osteosarcoma patients, through developing a uniform set of health outcomes for Osteosarcoma and using a consistent approach to measure the costs of care delivery. Design/Methods: The Porter's Outcomes Measurement Hierarchy was used to define the domains of health outcomes for Osteosarcoma. Timedriven activitybased costing (TDABC) method was used to determine the total costs of care delivered to Osteosarcoma patients throughout their journey of cure. Results: A standardized health outcomes reporting system was developed for Osteosarcoma based on the outcomes that mattered most to the patients. The degree of health was measured by the remission status as defined by EURAMOS1 protocol criteria, response to neoadjuvant treatment was defined as poor or good response pathologically, functional outcome was defined using the MSTS system, and return to normal activities was measured by the AMPS tool. Process of recovery was measured by evaluating the adverse events using CTCAE v.4.0, determining the delay in care cycles, reporting any medical or medication errors, and assessing the time to recovery. Sustainability of health was defined by measuring the quality of life using PedsQL questionnaire, palliative care at endoflife using POS survey, and measuring the longterm sequelae of treatment. Process mapping was done for Osteosarcoma care cycles, which included a total of twentyfive process maps to cover all the activities of care delivery. The costs were calculated based on the TDABC method for each process map. Conclusions: Developing a standardized system for measuring Osteosarcoma outcomes and the total costs for care is fundamental to improving the value of health care delivered to Osteosarcoma patients and for valuebased decisionmaking. O-058 Outcomes and Prognostic Variables in Relapsed Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumors (PNET) Treated with a Hybrid Salvage Chemotherapy Regimen K. Vijaysekharan 1, S. Ramanathan1, M. Prasad1, T. Vora1, Hospital, Oncology Pediatric, Mumbai, India; 2Tata Memorial Hospital, Surgical oncology Bone and Soft Tissue Tumor, Mumbai, India; 3Tata Memorial Hospital, Radiodiagnosis, Mumbai, India; 4Tata Memorial Hospital, India; 5Tata Memorial Hospital, Radiation Oncology, Mumbai, India; 6Tata Memorial Hospital, Nuclear Medicine, Mumbai, India Background/Objectives: Survival in relapsed PNET continues to be suboptimal (5 year survival:1020%). Considering that 30% patients with initially nonmetastatic PNET and a larger proportion of primary metastatic disease relapse, factors that determine outcome of relapsed patients needs clarity. This is an analysis of patients with relapsed PNET treated on a hybrid salvage regimen consisting of Topotecan/cyclophosphamide and Irinotecan/Temozolomide. Design/Methods: Retrospective analysis of patients with relapsed PNET treated with curative intent from Jan' 2012 to Dec'2016. All patients received a total of 12 cycles of chemotherapy and local therapy (surgery/radiotherapy after initial 4 cycles). A subset of patients also received oral metronomic maintenance therapy for 12 months. Results: The salvage regimen was employed in a total of 53/108 relapsed patients with the rest having opted for palliation upfront. The median age of the treated patients is 19 years(440); male:female2.7:1. The median time to first relapse was 18.8 months from end of primary treatment. While 41/53 patients(77%)completed the salvage therapy, 6 patients(11.3%) progressed and 6(11.3%) abandoned treatment. The median follow up of the study cohort is 23.6 months. Of the analyzable cohort(n=47),18(47%)had a second relapse. At time of last follow up, 17 patients had died (including one due to toxicity) and 30 patients were alive (22 with no active disease and 8 with disease). The 4 yearEFS and OS is 29.7% and 43% respectively for the entire cohort. While older patients (>17 years) had a better EFS (p=0.013), time to first relapse, site of primary disease, metastatic status at primary diagnosis, type of relapse (local vs metastatic), and gender had no impact on outcome. Conclusions: Salvage chemotherapy in relapsed PNET have been shown to have encouraging results in early phase and retrospective studies. This reasonably well tolerated regimen produced promising results in a tumor with otherwise poor outcome. O-059 Treatment of Localized Ewing Sarcomas of the Rib: EuroEWING99 Analysis of French Patients A. Claren 1, J. Doyen1, M. Eric2, A. (ES) of the rib represents the most frequent thoracic tumor in children and young adults, but specific data published remain scarce. The main objectives of this study were to evaluate survivals according to local treatment and to define precisely prognostic factors of these tumors. Design/Methods: French patients included in EuroEWING99 study (EE99) for localized ES of the rib, with or without pleural effusion, were eligible. Data were collected from the prospective EE99 database. In addition, a systematic retrospective review of all patient records was performed, to obtain more precise clinical, radiological or therapeutic data, which were not included in the EE99 database. Results: Eightytwo patients, median age 13.6 years, were treated between 12/1999 and 04/2013. Median followup was 8.4 years. Fiftyone percent had initial pleural effusion. Local treatment included surgery in 81/82 patients, mostly after induction chemotherapy. Sixty patients (73%) were irradiated: 28% on the tumor bed, 13% on the hemithorax (HRT), and 32% on both. Fiveyear disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were 69% and 71% respectively. Twentysix patients (31%) relapsed, with a median time of 19 months after diagnosis. Pleural effusion and incomplete surgical resection (R1 or R2) have proven to be independent prognostic factors for DFS and OS. In case of initial pleural effusion, documented or not, OS was 27% without HRT versus 68% after HRT (p=0.01). Delivering radiation on the tumor bed increased significantly the OS only in case of poor histological response. Conclusions: Pleural effusion at diagnosis and incomplete resection are two independent risk factors for survival in localized ES of the rib. Hemithoracic irradiation increases significantly overall survival in case of pleural effusion, proven or not. The impact of the boost on tumor bed according to the histological response and quality of surgery should be confirmed on more patients. Free Paper Session: PODC O-060 Developing a Clinical Diagnostic Algorithm for Lymphoma in Malawi K. Westmoreland 1,2, Montgomery3, Gronde4, Itimu4, Chapel Hill, USA; 3University of Lilongwe, Malawi; 7University of North Carolina, Microbiology and Immunology, Chapel Hill, USA; 8University of North Carolina, Pathology, Chapell Hill, USA; 9University of North Carolina, Oncology and Infectious Disease, Chapel Hill, USA; 10University subSaharan Africa (SSA). Tissuebased molecular confirmation of pediatric BL is standard in resourcerich settings, but is often impossible in SSA settings due to limited pathology, absent molecular diagnostic tools, and difficulty obtaining diagnostic tissue particularly from visceral sites. Design/Methods: We prospectively enrolled pediatric patients <18 years of age with possible lymphoma at Kamuzu Central Hospital in Lilongwe. Based on hematopathologist review of diagnostic specimens in the United States, cases were categorized as gold standard BL, possible but not confirmed BL, and nonBL. Gold standard BL was defined (EBVVL) was measured at baseline by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Gold standard BL was compared to nonBL using a ttest. Results: We identified 17 gold standard BL cases and 23 nonBL cases for analysis. Fiftyseven cases of possible BL were excluded, most due to cytologic specimen only prohibiting detailed immunophenotyping. Median age of BL cases was 11.7 years (IQR 7.814.2) and The positive predictive value of LDH >1.25x the upper limit of normal (ULN) and EBVVL >3.0 for BL was 71% (10/14 EBVVL are implementable diagnostic tools that can assist with confirming pediatric BL in SSA. Ongoing work includes developing and validating a clinical diagnostic algorithm for molecularly confirmed pediatric BL in a larger cohort of Malawian children. O-061 Clinical Profile and Outcome of Intermediate and High Risk Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma Treated in a Tertiary Care Cancer Centre B. Cheriyalinkal Parambil 1, G. Narula1, M. Prasad1, B. Arora1, 1Tata Memorial Hospital, Pediatric Oncology, Mumbai, India Background/Objectives: Classical Hodgkin lymphoma(cHL) has excellent 5year OS, though long term survival declines after 5 years due to relapse and late effects of therapy. Recent strategies seek to limit anthracyclines, alkylating agents, bleomycin and radiation therapy. We studied clinical profile and outcome of children with advanced cHL on this strategy. Design/Methods: Children(<15years) with cHL from February 2013 to December 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. Staging was by Positron emission computerized tomography(PETCT) in all. Bulky sites(X) at baseline received involved field radiation(IFRT) postchemotherapy. IAX,IBX,IIAX,IIE,IIIA were Intermediaterisk(IR) and IIBX,IIBE,IIIX,IIIE,IIIB,IV High risk(HR). OEPA(vincristine,etoposide,prednisolone, doxorubicin) followed by early PETCT. Complete metabolic responses(CMR) received 2 cycles COPDac(cyclophosphamide,vincristine,prednisolone,dacarbazine) for IR,4 for HR. Partial Responses(PR) were reevaluated after 2 or 4 cycles COPDac. Refractory at end treatment or progressive disease at any time were considered for salvage options. Results: Hundred and seventeen children(IR12, HR105) were eligible. Median age was 9 years,M:F4.5:1,Bsymptoms70.6%,Bulky disease86%. response,94(81.7%) had CMR,while 1(0.8%) progressed. Seventeen among 20 PR cases had second PET and 13(76.4%) achieved CMR by endtreatment. Eightyeight(75%) received 8(9%) delayed CMR. At a median followup of months(range,943),3year OS Gender,bulky disease,Bsymptoms,albumin<4gm/dl or early PET response had no significant impact on OS and EFS,though a trend towards improved EFS was seen in patients with Hb>10.5g/dl. Conclusions: Primary chemotherapy based on OEPA+COPDac with IFRT in advanced cHL has good 3year OS and EFS with manageable toxicities,but longterm effects needs further followup. Intensifying primary chemotherapy in advanced cHL attains better disease control,while avoiding therapies with known late toxicities. O-062 Improvement in Compliance of Patients with NonMetastatic Retinoblastoma with LowCost Prospective Database and Patient Tracking System: A Study from Tertiary Care Centre in India A. Batra 1, D. Dhawan1, R. Paul1, M. Kumari1, S. Bakhshi1 1All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Medical Oncology, New Delhi, India Background/Objectives: Poor compliance has been reported in retinoblastoma (RB) from resource constraint settings. Prospective database and patient tracking system (PDPTS) may improve compliance and hence treatment outcomes in RB. Design/Methods: PDPTS was introduced in January 2008 at our centre, wherein patients were contacted telephonically on missing their outpatient visit and were encouraged to complete the treatment; and contact information was updated at each visit. We compared compliance of patients with nonmetastatic RB treated prior to and after PDPTS. 'Adequate therapy' and 'Effective therapy' defined compliance during treatment period (Stage 0: 4 cycles chemotherapy and 1 EUA; Stage 1: Enucleation; Stage 2: Enucleation and 4 cycles chemotherapy; Stage 3: Enucleation, 4 cycles chemotherapy and radiation) and followup (1 year followup or recurrence, in addition to adequate therapy), respectively. Results: Two hundred fourteen and 298 patients with RB were treated during June 2003 to December 2007 (phase 1) and January 2008 to December 2014 (phase 2), respectively. Median age (36 months) and sex distribution (male: female2:1) were similar in both phases. Patients with stage III RB had lowest compliance. Proportion of patients receiving adequate (All stages: 63% vs 77%, 62%, p=0.58; Stage 3: 24% vs 42%, p=0.06) was significantly higher in phase 2. Annual cost was 7USD per patient and 350 USD per extra effectively treated patient. Conclusions: PDPTS has significantly improved compliance in patients with RB with minimal added cost. Improvement was seen even in stage III disease with lowest compliance. O-063 Impact of a Patient Navigator Program on Pediatric Cancer Outcomes in a Low Resource Setting F. Alvi1, J. Mafwimbo2, N. Masalu2, K. Schroeder 3,4 1Washington University, School of USA; Durham, USA Background/Objectives: Oncology patient navigation programs have been successfully implemented at hospitals throughout the U.S., enhancing the quality of care through financial guidance, treatment coordination, and psychosocial support. In low resource settings, the barriers to receiving cancer care are increased and a patient navigator in this setting has the potential to significantly impact outcomes. However, there is limited research on the efficacy of such programs in these settings. At Bugando Medical Centre (BMC) in Mwanza, Tanzania, a patient navigation program was established to identify potential pediatric oncology patients, then assist patients and their families throughout the diagnosis and treatment process, with the goals of reducing time to oncology evaluation and diagnosis, and ultimately improving survival outcomes. Design/Methods: A retrospective analysis of hospital records was conducted of all pediatric oncology patients seen at BMC from 20102016, separated by presentation date before or after establishment of navigation program. Collected data includes demographics, diagnosis, time from presentation to oncology evaluation and diagnosis, treatment completion and 1 year survival outcomes. Results: A total of 238 patient files were reviewed, with 169 pre and 69 post program initiation. Patient groups did not differ by age or gender (p=0.329 and 0.744), or diagnosis distribution. After establishing a patient navigator program, the average time to oncology evaluation decreased from 49.7 to 16.6 days (p=0.015), and time to diagnosis decreased from 49.1 to 23.6 days (p=0.07). Treatment abandonment decreased from 50% to 38% (p<0.001) and 1 year survival increased from 27% to 53% (p<0.001). Conclusions: In pediatric cancer, early diagnosis is critical to the initiation of chemotherapy and improving outcomes. This study has shown that a patient navigation program has the potential to significantly impact patient outcomes, and should be included in comprehensive pediatric cancer care programs. O-064 Cost Effectiveness of Implementing a Pediatric Early Warning System (PEWS) At a Pediatric Oncology Hospital in a LowMiddle Income Bhakta1 1St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Department of Global Pediatric Medicine, Memphis, USA; 2Unidad Nacional de Oncolog\u00eda Pedi\u00e1trica, Hematology/Oncology, Guatemala, Guatemala Background/Objectives: Hospitalized pediatric oncology patients are at high risk for clinical decline and mortality, particularly in low and middleincome countries. Pediatric Early Warning Systems (PEWS) are nursingadministered clinical assessment tools that aid with early identification of deterioration. In 2014, a multidisciplinary team implemented a modified PEWS at Unidad Nacional de Oncolog\u00eda Pedi\u00e1trica (UNOP), a pediatric oncology hospital in Guatemala. Published data demonstrated this intervention reduced clinical deterioration events and PICU utilization. In this study, we investigate the cost and costeffectiveness of PEWS implementation at UNOP. Design/Methods: The variable costs of running and maintaining the PICU and floor wards at UNOP were calculated for 2013 (preimplementation) and 2015 (postimplementation) using hospital administrative data. PEWS implementation costs were based on study expenditures in 2014. The number of PICU inpatientdays averted due to reduced unplanned PICU transfers (clinical deterioration events) postimplementation was calculated after adjusting for changes in total hospital inpatientdays. Hospital savings per inpatientday due to reduced variable cost expenditures from unplanned PICU transfers were calculated. All costs were adjusted for inflation and standardized using 2013 international dollars (I$). Results: There were 457 fewer PICU inpatientdays due to unplanned transfers after PEWS implementation in 2015 compared to 2013. The difference in variable costs of an unplanned PICU transfer was I$597.36 per day (PICU minus ward). The total cost of implementing PEWS at UNOP was I$20,706.08, representing a cost I$10.08 per hospital inpatientday. Through reductions in variable PICU costs such as supportive care measures, UNOP was able to save a net I$122.77 per inpatient admission (I$252,176.31 annual net savings) as a result of PEWS implementation. Conclusions: Implementation of PEWS at UNOP, a pediatric oncology hospital located in a lowmiddle income country, resulted in net costsavings. This work demonstrates that hospital investment in a PEWS program can both improve the quality pediatric cancer care and reduce hospital costs. O-065 Participatory Action Research in Lilongwe, Malawi: Identification of Five Pediatric Palliative Care Interventions That Address Total Pain for Pediatric Oncology Patients and Their Families M. Butia Mutai 3Baylor College Cancer and Hematology Centers, Houston, USA; 4Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital Pediatric Palliative Care, Houston, USA; 5Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital Section of Palliative Care, Houston, USA Background/Objectives: The World Health Organization defines effective pediatric palliative care (PPC) as the total care of a child's body, mind and spirit involving interdisciplinary support to the entire family using community resources. While assessment and management of children's pain remains a global priority, the International Children's Palliative Care Network has also identified creation of interventions and models of care for PPC as a top global research priority. Additional literature demonstrates that participatory action research (PAR) results in sustainable health care delivery models. A program that maximizes community involvement to establish interventions and models of care for PPC and treatment of total pain in Malawi is needed. Design/Methods: Qualitative data obtained through semistructured interviews were collected and analyzed to identify methods to address patients' total pain. Participants included bereaved parents of children with incurable hematologic/oncologic diagnoses (n=5) and medical providers from a tertiary care public hospital oncology unit (n=5). Two independent reviewers conducted thematic data analyses. Results: Five interventions to mitigate total pain were identified. All participants described parents' \"abandonment from their spiritual community\" and expressed urgent need for spiritual support. All participants cited need for financial support for food security. Supportive home visits and enhanced community education to minimize stigma were universally suggested. All parents recommended support groups to address emotional/psychological distress. Four medical providers advocated for play therapy to address patients' stress and pain, and all providers cited the need for ongoing psychosocial support training. Conclusions: Using PAR to promote community involvement in the creation of a PPC program to treat total pain in Malawi is feasible and enlightened areas of focus. Financial support, spiritual support, play therapy, home visits, and parental support groups were identified as the most immediate needs and will guide next steps in developing a novel PPC program in this population. Free Paper Session: Neuroblastoma Biology O-066 Mutations in CIC, DMD and PHOX2B Activate the RASMAPK Pathway in Neuroblastoma and Activation of this Pathway Causes Tumor Progression T.F. Oncology, Utrecht, the Netherlands; 2Department of Oncogenomics, AMC Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; 3Department of Pediatric Oncology, Emma Childrens Hospital, AMC Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands Background/Objectives: We recently showed that mutations affecting the RASMAPK pathway occur frequently in neuroblastoma relapse tumors. We hypothesized that activation of this pathway is associated with poor prognosis and tumor progression. Hence the objectives were to detect the activation state of the RASMAPK pathway in tumors, correlate this to prognosis and find mutations that can serve as biomarkers for pathway activation. Design/Methods: We generated a gene signature that can identify the activation state of the RASMAPK pathway in cell lines and tumors. These data were correlated to Whole Genome Sequencing data to identify novel mutations that activate this pathway. Candidate mutations were induced in cell lines using gene editing and characterized both in vitro and in vivo. Results: In primary neuroblastoma tumors activation of the RASMAPK pathway correlates with poor survival and is associated with mutations in ALK and other known RASMAPK genes. From integrative analysis we identify mutations in PHOX2B, CIC and DMD that activate the RASMAPK pathway in vitro and we show that activation of this pathway causes tumor progression in vivo. Conclusion: We identify novel biomarkers of RASMAPK activation and reinforce this pathway as a promising target in neuroblastoma. Further research should determine whether the identified mutations also function as biomarkers for sensitivity to MEK inhibition. O-067 Primary Site of Origin Predicts Differential Genomics Thoracic Versus Adrenal Neuroblastoma B. J. Maris2, K. Matthay1 1University of California San Francisco, Pediatrics, San Francisco, USA; 2University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Pediatrics, Philadelphia, USA; 3Harvard Medical School, DanaFarber / Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Boston, USA Background/Objectives: Neuroblastoma is the second most common extracranial malignancy of childhood, and has long been recognized as a biologically and clinically heterogeneous disease. Based on recent studies demonstrating a significant relationship between the primary tumor site, prognosis, and tumor biological features, we hypothesized that thoracic and adrenal neuroblastoma represent different disease subsets with different genomic features. Design/Methods: We utilized the TARGET dataset to evaluate the genetic profiles of adrenal (N=646) versus thoracic (N=118) primary tumors. We also evaluated for association of common germline variation with primary site in a separate EuropeanAmerican cohort of adrenal (N=707) or thoracic (N=320) primary tumors. Appropriate platforms were employed to evaluate differences in copy number alterations, mutations, RNA expression, pathway enrichment, and common germline variation between primary sites. Binary variable associations were evaluated by Fisherexact test. Prior evidence of in vitro transforming capability were applied to call highlikelihood driver mutations in ALK prior to association testing. Results: We observed higher rates of MYCN amplification, chromosome 1q gain, and chromosome 11q deletion among adrenal tumors, which were highly predictive of functional signatures observed in RNA data. Adrenal neuroblastomas were less likely to harbor ALK driver mutations than thoracic cases among all cases (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.290.97) and among cases without MYCN amplification 95% CI 0.180.65). BARD1 (previously associated with highrisk neuroblastoma) were found to be strongly associated with predisposition for origin at adrenal, rather than thoracic, sites. Conclusions: Genomic features differ aberrations) were more common among adrenal tumors, though ALK driver mutations were more common among thoracic tumors. The presence of specific germline variants increase the likelihood of adrenal over thoracic site of origin, reinforcing the differences between these two subgroups of this disease. O-068 Liquid Biopsies of Patients with HIGHRISK Neuroblastoma Disclose Exosomal miRNA Modulation after Segalerba1, Sanitaria La Fe, of Cellular and Molecular Biology, Valencia, Spain; 5Hospital Universitario y Polit\u00e9cnico La Fe, Pediatric Oncology, Valencia, Spain; 6Leeds Institute of Cancer and Pathology, Research and Hematology, Berlin, response of patients with Highrisk (HR) neuroblastoma (NB) to the front line induction chemotherapy is crucial to determine the subsequent treatment. The absence of early molecular markers predictive of sensitivity/resistance to treatment led us to the study of exosomes, small vesicles considered the bioprint of tumor cells in liquid biopsies. We investigated whether exosomal miRNA (exomiRs) can be early biomarkers of the response to the inductionchemotherapy. Design/Methods: We collected exosomes from plasma samples of 50 patients with HRNB before and after the induction chemotherapy. ExomiR expression was evaluated with RTqPCR on a 381 target panel. Data analyses included feature selection and pathway analysis. Results: The expression of 20 exomiRs was significantly modulated in response to chemotherapy, providing the first evidence that exomiRs may serve as biomarkers of the chemotherapic response. Cluster analysis distinguished two groups of patients, effectively dividing very good partial responders and minor responders. The correlation of the two groups with other clinical and biological features is under investigation. Pathway analysis determined whether chemotherapy influenced the expression of miRNAs known to be involved in sensitivity/resistance to drugs commonly employed in the inductionchemotherapy. The analysis revealed that 42% of the 20 differentially expressed exomiRs were associated with sensitivity/resistance to drug response. Mapping the results to individual patients, we identified distinct groups of subjects potentially unresponsive/resistant to the induction drugs. The exomiR profile in the middle phase of the induction therapy is under investigation to find miRNAs predictors of the response, which may allow a timely change in the induction protocol for those unresponsive patients. Conclusions: We demonstrated that exomiR can represent biomarkers of the response to inductionchemotherapy and potential indicators of sensitivity/resistance to specific drugs for patients with HRNB. These results pave the way to a broad application of exomiRs in liquid biopsies applied to neuroblastoma targeted treatment. O-069 Circulating Tumor DNA for Disease Monitoring in Neuroblastoma L. van Zogchel 1,2, E. The Netherlands; 2Sanquin Research Amsterdam The Netherlands and Landsteiner Laboratory of the AMC University of Amsterdam, Department of Experimental Immunohematology, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; 3Emma Childrens Hospital Academical Medical Center, Department of Pediatric Oncology, Amsterdam, The Netherlands Background/Objectives: Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has been used for disease monitoring in several types of cancer. The aim of our study was to investigate whether ctDNA can be used for response monitoring in neuroblastoma. Design/Methods: 162 plasma samples from 63 patients were analyzed for detection of hypermethylated RASSF1A DNA. DNA was isolated and total cell free DNA (cfDNA) was determined by qPCR for albumin and the amount of ctDNA was determined by qPCR for methylated RASSF1A after bisulfite conversion. Detection of ctDNA was compared with clinicbiological patient characteristics, such as BM PB 4/10 (40%) patients with Iocalized disease. During induction chemotherapy (stage 4 patients only) in 15/45 samples ctDNA was detected (33%). At (suspected) relapse in 11 out of 18 samples ctDNA was detected (61%). The amount of cfDNA was significantly higher in patients with neuroblastoma at time of diagnosis and relapse compared to healthy controls, with the highest amount in patients with stage 4. There was significant correlation between ctDNA and PB or BM MRD, when tumor levels were high or no tumor was detected. Discrepancies were observed in 20 samples and were studied in detail. The discrepancies indicated either low tumor burden (ctDNA/MRD+) or tumor (and metastases) without or with minimal BM involvement (ctDNA+/MRD). Conclusions: Hypermethylated RASSF1A can be used for monitoring of ctDNA in patients with neuroblastoma and highly correlates with the disease status at diagnosis. Our data indicate that there is a poorer correlation when tumor load is very low, with both samples with ctDNA+/MRD and ctDNA/MRD+. It is likely that ctDNA can originate from both primary tumor and metastases and may be of special interest for disease monitoring in patients relapsing in other organs than the BM. O-070 Efficacy of ANTIGD2 Antibody CH14.18/CHO and PD1/PDL1 Checkpoint in Neuroblastoma H. 1, J\u00fcttner1, S. effective for treatment of highrisk neuroblastoma (NB) patients and was approved by EMA with and without IL2 comedication. The mechanism of action is cytotoxicity (ADCC). Programmed death1 (PD1) an inhibitory receptor expressed by activated T and NKcells, and cancer cells express PD1 ligand (PDL1). Here, we report for the first time effect and mechanism of PD1/PDL1 blockade in the context of ch14.18/CHO therapy in preclinical models. Design/Methods: Expression of PDL1 and PD1 on NB cells and leukocytes was analyzed by RTPCR and flow cytometry in the presence of ch14.18/CHO with and without IL2. Mechanism of PDL1 induction was analyzed with antiCD11b Ab. The effect of PD1/PDL1 blockade on ch14.18/CHOmediated antiNB immune response was evaluated using antiPD1 Ab both in vitro (Nivolumab) and in the +/PDL1+ NB in combination with antiPD1 (8x250 g, and compared to controls. without and with IL2 (100 IU/ml) induced a 2 and 3 fold upregulation of PDL1, respectively, and inhibited Nivolumab reversed the PDL1dependent inhibition of ADCC. Finally, mice treated with ch14.18/CHO in combination with PD1 blockade showed strongest reduction of tumor growth, longest survival rate as well as the highest level of NB cell lysis mediated by serum and leukocytes of treated mice compared to controls. Conclusions: Ch14.18/CHO and IL2 upregulate the inhibitory checkpoint PD1/PDL1 of ch14.18/CHO with PD1/PDL1 blockade results in synergistic treatment effects in preclinical models. This suggests clinical evaluation of ch14.18/CHO in combination with PD1/PDL1 checkpoint inhibition. O-071 Targeted Combination Strategies to Improve the Clinical Implementation of Venetoclax for Neuroblastoma Utrecht, The Netherlands; 2University Medical Center Biology, Utrecht, The MC Sophia Netherlands; 4Amsterdam Medical Center University of Amsterdam, Oncogenomics, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; 5Emma Children's Hospital Amsterdam Medical Center University of Amsterdam, Pediatric Oncology, Amsterdam, The Netherlands Background/Objectives: The antiapoptotic protein B cell lymphoma/leukaemia 2 (BCL2) is highly expressed in the majority of all neuroblastoma. In previous preclinical studies, we have shown that treatment of BCL2dependent neuroblastoma with BCL2 inhibitors leads to programmed cell death. These results have contributed to the initiation of a phase I trial to study the safety and pharmacokinetics of venetoclax in children with relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma. The current study focused on the identification and validation of targeted combination strategies to prevent or overcome neuroblastoma resistance to venetoclax. Design/Methods: Targeted drugs for combination treatment with venetoclax were identified by compoundwide screens with >200 compounds using normal neuroblastoma cell lines and neuroblastoma cell lines made resistant to venetoclax. Top hits were subsequently tested more extensively in vitro and in vivo to validate the screening results. Results: Highthroughput drug screens identified MDM2 inhibitor idasanutlin as strongest in venetoclaxresistant BCL2dependent neuroblastoma cells with wildtype p53 cellular tumor antigen. Subsequent in vitro validation showed that idasanutlin caused cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1 (p21)mediated growth arrest in nonresistant cells, while inducing a BCL2associated X protein (BAX)mediated apoptotic response in venetoclaxresistant neuroblastoma cells in the presence of venetoclax. In vivo combination of venetoclax with idasanultin resulted in a remarkably improved anticancer effect compared to single agent therapy, with almost complete regression of BCL2dependent neuroblastoma xenografts. Combination screens additionally revealed the genomic background of the neuroblastoma tumors. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that the clinical use of venetoclax for the treatment of children with BCL2dependent neuroblastoma tumors can be improved by combination therapy with targeted inhibitors. Optimal targeted combination strategies depend on the presence of additional genomic events driving neuroblastoma tumors. Free Paper Session: Renal Tumours O-072 Impact OF 1Q Status on Outcomes of Stage IV Favorable Histology Wilms Tumor (FHWT) Patients Treated on the Children's Oncology Study E. J. 1DanaFarber/Boston Blood Disorders Center, Pediatric Oncology, Boston, USA; 2Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, Chicago, USA; 3University of Florida, Gainsville, and Oncology, Canada; 5University of Tennessee College of Medicine, Pediatric Oncology, Chattanooga, USA; 6Nationwide Children's Hospital and The Ohio State University Medical Center, Biopathology Center, Columbus, USA; 7Washington University School of Medicine, Pediatric Radiology, Saint Louis, USA; 8University of Michigan, Pediatric Surgery, Ann USA; 9Cincinnati Hospital, Pediatric USA; Canada; 12Children's National and Oncology, Washington DC, USA Background/Objectives: 1q gain has been found to be a negative prognostic marker in multiple retrospective European and North American studies. Following 6 weeks of vincristine/dactinomycin/doxorubicin (DD4A), protocol AREN0533 stratified Stage IV FHWT patients to intensified five drug therapy with addition of cyclophosphamide/etoposide (regimen M) for slow incomplete response (SIR) of pulmonary metastasis, extrapulmonary metastasis (EPM), and/or gain of combined LOH 1p and 16q. DD4A was continued and pulmonary radiation withheld for those with rapid complete response (RCR). We analyzed the impact of 1q status in this novel treatment algorithm. Design/Methods: 1q status was successfully analyzed in 248 evaluable patients by multiplex ligationdependent probe amplification. Event free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were summarized at year 4 and compared using the logrank test. Results: 30% (75/248) had gain of 1q. Overall, those with 1q gain (N= 75) had with SIR and 1q (42/116=36%) had an EFS of 86%, compared to 92% with SR without 1q gain (p=0.15); OS was 93% 96% (p=0.45). Patients with RCR and 1q gain (21/96=22%) had worse outcome than those with RCR without 1q gain (EFS RCR with 1q gain For patients with EPM (n=36), 33% (N=12) had (EFS 88%) [p=0.15]. Conclusions: 1q gain was associated with inferior EFS for RCR Stage IV FHWT patients with isolated pulmonary metastasis; these patients are not appropriate candidates for radiation omission. Regimen M may mitigate adverse impact of 1q gain in other stage IV risk categories. O-073 Effect of Chemotherapy Dosage on Outcome of Patients with Stage IIIV Diffuse Anaplastic Wilms Tumor: Results from Dome19 1The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Division of Pediatrics, Houston, USA; 2University of Florida, Statistics, Gainsville, USA; 3Ann and Robert H Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, Radiation Oncology, Chicago, USA; 4Quality Assurance Review Ctr, Diagnostic Imaging, Hospital Medical Center, Hematology/Oncology, Cincinnati, USA; 6Ann and Robert H Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, Pathology, Chicago, USA; 7C S Mott Children's Hospital, Surgery, USA; 9DanaFarber/Harvard Cancer Center, Boston, USA; 10Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Hematology/Oncology, USA; 14Merck Research Laboratories, Oncology, North Wales, USA; 15The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Radiation Oncology, Houston, USA; 16University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Radiation Oncology, Philadelphia, USA; 17Baylor College of Medicine/Dan L Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center, Hematology/Oncology, Houston, USA; 18IWK Health Centre, Pediatrics and Bioethics, Halifax, Canada; 19Children's National Medical Center, Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders, Washington, USA Background/Objectives: In National Wilms Tumor Study5, 4year relapsefree survival with (95% CI, 4868%). AREN0321 evaluated a more intensive regimen containing carboplatin in addition to adjusted doses of chemotherapy used in Regimen I (Regimen UH1). Dosages of chemotherapy were reduced midstudy due to nonhematologic toxicity that exceeded predefined stopping rules. We analyzed the effect of this dose reduction on eventfree survival (EFS), overall survival (OS) and toxicity. Design/Methods: Patients with stages IIIV DAWT without measurable disease received Regimen UH1. Patients with stage IV measurable disease had the option to receive vincristine in combination with irinotecan (VI) in an upfront window; those with partial response had VI incorporated into Regimen UH1 (Regimen UH2). Cumulative doses of doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide UH1/UH2 due to nonhematologic toxicity. Results: Of 66 eligible patients, 23 were treated with UH1, 32 with revised UH1, and 5 each with UH2 and revised UH2. Fouryear EFS for all patients was OS was 76% (95% CI, 6488%). Fouryear EFS for stage II, III IV disease were 86% (95% CI, 3078%), EFS for patients treated with UH1/UH2 was 85% (95% CI, 7199%) compared to 68% 4988%) for patients treated with revised UH1/UH2 (p=0.12). There was one grade 5 toxicity attributed to treatment on UH1/UH2 and two on revised UH1/UH2. The number of grade 34 nonhematologic toxicities per patient was 3.9 for UH1/UH2 and 3.1 for revised UH1/UH2. Conclusions: For patients with stage IIIV DAWT, Regimens UH1/UH2 showed a trend toward superior EFS compared to Revised UH1/UH2, with comparable rates of grade 35 toxicity. O-074 Epidemiology of Patients with Wilms Tumour Registered in Successive UKTrials through 38 Years K. 1,2, S. Tugnait1, K. PritchardJones1 1UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, Developmental Biology and Cancer Programme, London, United Kingdom; 2Cancer Control Center Osaka International Cancer Center, Department of Cancer Strategy, Osaka, Japan; 3Mater Dei Hospital, Paediatric and Adolescent Denmark; 6Public Health England, National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service, Oxford, United Kingdom; 7Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences University of Birmingham, Cancer Research UK Clinical Trials Unit, Birmingham, United Kingdom; 8Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, Department of Paediatric Histopathology, Manchester, United Kingdom; 9University Hospital of Wales, Department of Cellular Pathology, Cardiff, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: Since 1979, 2,510 patients with Wilms tumour (WT) have been registered in five consecutive UK clinical trials (UKW13, SIOP2001, and IMPORT). We reviewed all trial data with focus on congenital abnormalities (CA) and laterality. Design/Methods: We categorised patients with other congenital abnormalities (otherCA), and without CA (nonCA). We compared distribution of sex, age at diagnosis, stage, histology and 5year overall survival (OS) of each group to those of nonCA. Bilateral vs unilateral tumours were compared for similar outcomes. Results: Numbers and proportions in each group in WA, UM and otherCA groups had younger median age of diagnosis and higher proportion of bilateral disease compared to nonCA (20m, 21m 6%, respectively). HH patients showed no significant difference compared to nonCA group (41m and 11%). UM had male predominance (M/F ratio 1.72 vs 0.88 in nonCA). There were no significant differences in 5year OS for each group compared to nonCA (nonCA)]. Compared to unilateral disease, the bilateral group had female excess (M/F ratio 0.62 vs 0.93), younger age at diagnosis (24m 39m) and poorer 5year OS (82% vs 89%, p=0.003) that had improved to 90% for cases diagnosed since 2002. Conclusions: About one in nine patients with WT had congenital abnormalities. These patients are diagnosed at earlier age, have more frequent bilateral tumours but 5year survival rate seems very similar. Compared to unilateral, bilateral WT were younger and had poorer survival. O-075 Prognostic Value of Age in Patients with Wilms Tumour Treated According to International Society of Paediatric Oncology (SIOP) 9301 and SIOP 2001 Protocols J. Hol 1, M. Lopez2, M. Van Grotel1, K. PritchardJones3, B. De Camargo4, T. Acha5, H. Van N. The Netherlands; 3UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, Paediatric Oncology, London, United Kingdom; 4Instituto Nacional de Cancer Homburg, Germany Background/Objectives: Age has been suggested to be a prognostic factor for recurrence and mortality in patients with Wilms tumour (WT). In this study, we assess the prognostic value of age and cutoffs for risk stratification in paediatric patients with unilateral WT treated according to recent International Society of Paediatric Oncology(SIOP) protocols. Design/Methods: Patients (6 months18 years) with stage IIV WT were derived from the SIOP9301 and SIOP2001 database. Only patients who received preoperative chemotherapy were included. The prognostic value of age at diagnosis, per year/categorized, for 5year eventfree survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) was assessed using the Kaplan Meier method, logrank test and multivariable Cox regression models. Martingale residual plots were used to assess the functional form of age. The multivariable analysis was adjusted for gender, biopsy (yes/no), pathological stage, histological classification and tumour volume at 5386/7880 patients the diagnosis was 3.4 years (interquartile range, IQR: 2.0-5.1) and median followup was 6.3 years 93% (95%CI 91.993.4), respectively. Assessment of martingale residual plots suggested a linear trend for age in both EFS and OS. Significant differences in EFS and OS were found between ages <2, 24, 410 and 10 (logrank p<0.0001). In multivariable analyses, increasing age was associated with poorer EFS (linear trend p<0.0001). OS was lower in patients 4 years compared to patients <2 years (HR=1.32, 95%CI 1.132.57). No linear trend was found. Higher stage, histological risk group and volume were associated with poorer OS and EFS in univariable and multivariable analyses. Conclusions: Survival worsens with increasing age in patients with WT. However, our results do not seem to justify the use of age cutoffs for risk stratification in pretreated patients. O-076 Mode of Presentation of Renal Tumours of Childhood: First Analysis of Data from the Prospective \"IMPORT\" Study in the UK and Republic of Ireland K. PritchardJones 1, J. Brok1 1University College London, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, London, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: The Improving Population Outcomes for Renal Tumours of childhood (IMPORT) study collects data on the mode of presentation to facilitate international benchmarking of Wilms tumour (WT) survival rates in relation to patient/tumour demographics and different models of primary care. Design/Methods: Data were extracted from case report forms submitted by all 20 UK and Republic of Ireland principal treatment centres for childhood cancer. All cases had central pathology review. The registration form had 4 categories of mode of tumour with WT from Q4/2012Q4/2016. Diagnosis was through routes 1&2 in twenty (6 %) patients, route 3 in 53 (16%) and route 4 in 258 (78%). Median age at diagnosis of WT was 1.8y, 3.3y with high risk histology (15%; 13%; 4, Median tumour volume at diagnosis was 623ml for 306 patients with 3D measurements; 59ml for routes 522ml for route 3; 665ml for route 4. Conclusions: Majority of patients presented with tumourspecific symptoms. Patients diagnosed by screening or child health checks were younger, with less metastatic disease. Stage III disease was more frequent in children presenting with tumourspecific symptoms who also had the highest median tumour volume. This ongoing data collection on mode of presentation is now being extended across Europe and will allow benchmarking, including tumour size and stage at diagnosis, to offer evidence regarding need for paediatric expertise in the primary care of symptomatic children O-077 LongTerm Renal Function in Children with Wilms Tumour Mutation K. PritchardJones 1 1UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London, London, United Kingdom; 2Paediatric Residency Program, University of Foggia, Foggia, Italy; 3Dept. of Clinical Genetics, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom; 4Dept. of Paediatric Nephrology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: Wilms Tumour (WT) survivors, especially patients with associated syndromes or genitourinary anomalies due to constitutional WT1 mutation, have increased risk of endstage renal disease. We described the longterm renal function in children with WT and WT1 mutation to guide their challenging oncological management. Design/Methods: Retrospective analysis of patients with WT and WT1 mutation treated 19932016 laterality, treatment Results: identified 23 patients with WT1 mutation; deletion (4), missense (2), nonsense (7), frameshift (6), splice site (4). Males 61%, bilateral disease 48%, median age at diagnosis unilateral nephrectomy, for 32 tumours/22 patients (10 bilateral) showed 13 mixed, 14 stromal, 2 regressive, 1 blastemal, 2 only intralobarnephrogenic rest. Twentythree tumours had associated nephrogenic rests (17 intralobar) and none had anaplasia. At median 6y duration followup, all patients were alive, 3 in remission after relapse. Six patients (26%) required longterm dialysis; 4 due to chronic kidney disease 2 due to bilateral nephrectomy (one upfront, one relapse). Of these, 4 had renal transplants and 2 are listed. Two patients developed chronic kidney disease stage3 (eGFR <60ml/min/1.73m2), 15 retained normal eGFR, but 11 had increased albuminuria (9 on ACEinhibitors). Four patients (3 frameshift; 1 WT1 deletion) had normal kidney parameters (followup 11, 8, 1.5, 0.5 years). Conclusions: Despite the known high frequency of chronic kidney disease in patients with WT and constitutional WT1 mutation, 2/3 patients had sustained normal eGFR. This should guide oncology management regarding the balanced decision about NSS without compromising oncological risk. Larger international studies are needed to further refine the prediction of WT1 genotype for longevity of renal function. Free Paper Session: Supportive Care and Palliative Care O-078 Safety Profile of HighDose Thiotepa with Autologous Stem Cells Rescue in Children and Adolescents Treated for a Solid Tumor: A SingleInstitution Report on 465 Courses C. Pasqualini1, C. Dufour1, I. Hezam2, Y. on highdose Thiotepa (HDThio) followed by autologous stem cell rescue (ASCR) in pediatric settings are very few. We aim to define the safety profile of HDThio with ASCR in a large pediatric cohort of solid tumors. Design/Methods: We analysed data prospectively recorded from patients with a solid tumor treated with HDThio followed by ASCR from 1986 to January 2016 in the Children and Adolescents Oncology Unit at Gustave Roussy. No sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) prophylaxis was performed. Toxicity is reported according to CTCAE v4.0. Results: HDThio was administered to 354 patients, as a tandem HDchemotherapy (HDC) in 111 patients. The median age at diagnosis was 6.4 years (0.224.1). The most represented diseases relapse for 135/355 patients (38%). In total, 465 courses were performed, at the dose of 600, 720, 900 mg/m2 for 165, 84 and 216 patients, respectively. The most common toxicity was digestive, as grade 3 mucositis and diarrhoea in 102 (22%) and 50 (11%) patients, respectively. Neurological toxicity grade 3 was reported in 42 patients (9%). Three patients experienced SOS, mild for 2 of them. The median days to neutrophils and platelets recovery was 8 days (237 and 0377, respectively), and the median duration of hospitalisation was 22 days (1470). A toxic mortality rate of 2% (n=7) was observed, directly related to HDThio in 1 patient (SOS). Toxicity profile was not different between single and tandem HDThio and between relapse and firstline treatment. Conclusions: HDThio with ASCR is globally well tolerated in children and adolescents with solid tumors, even as a tandem HDC and in heavily pretreated patients. Prophylaxis for SOS is not mandatory. Digestive and neurological toxicities need a careful supportive care management. O-079 Guideline for the Infusion Duration of Anthracycline Chemotherapy Agents in Children with Cancer of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Groningen, The Netherlands; 2Emma Children's Hospital Academic Medical Center, Department of Pediatric Oncology, Amsterdam, The Netherlands Background/Objectives: One of the established side effects of anthracycline chemotherapy agents, which are used in various pediatric oncology treatment protocols, is short and longterm cardiotoxicity. A proposed strategy to minimise this cardiotoxicity is to lengthen the infusion duration. We aimed to develop recommendations for the infusion duration of anthracycline chemotherapy agents in children with cancer. Design/Methods: Using an existing Cochrane sytematic review as starting point, first a topup search was performed. A national, multidisciplinary panel (16 persons) was formed, representing all relevant fields and including patient representatives. With use of the established GRADE system for evidence appraisal and their more recent Evidence to Decision framework, the panel formulated evidence summaries and recommendations. Results: 7 studies (4 adult, 3 pediatric) were included, with a low to very low quality of evidence. Regarding outcomes, overall survival, clinical heart failure, progression free survival and subclinical heart failure were unanimously categorized as critical for decisionmaking. The panel agreed on a weak recommendation against a push infusion of anthracycline chemotherapy. A recommendation defining a more precise infusion time period was currently not possible. Research recommendations were formulated, calling for large randomized trials and pharmacokinetic studies. Conclusions: In this guideline we provide recommendations regarding infusion duration of anthracycline chemotherapy in children with cancer. Given the evidence shortage of highquality studies that address this question, further research is needed. O-080 Anesthetic Management of Superselective Ophtalmic Arterial Chemotherapy for Retinoblastoma in Children L. Martynov1, N. Matinyan 1, A. Sotnikov1, I. Letyagin1, Institute Blokhin department, Russia Background/Objectives: Superselective ophthalmic artery chemotherapy (SOAC) with melphalan has significantly reduced the need of enucleation in patients with retinoblastoma. Lifethreatening complication of the SOAC procedure, which is expressed in hemodynamic instability and bronchospasm (presumably due to oculocardiac reflex), significantly limits the wider implementation of this technique in children. Our experience of SOAC and lifethreatening adverse cardiorespiratory reactions we have observed are described. Design/Methods: Between February 2011 and February 2017 in Pediatric Oncology and Hematology Institute 229 SOAC procedures were performed under general anesthesia, patients aged 17 +/ 5.1 months. After a. carotis interna catheterization continuous iv infusion of Epinephrine 0.05 - 0.1 mcg/kg/min was started. If the signs of oculocardiac reflex were observed, bolus of Epinephrine 0.5 mcg/kg was administered. Results: There were no deaths or major complications. Oculocardiac reflex was triggered during 74 procedures (32%). All reactions occurred during second or subsequent procedures and were characterized by hypoxia, reduced lung compliance (bronchospasm) followed by a subsequent deterioration in the oxygen saturation(Sp02) to 70%. Ventilation with 100% oxygen was initiated. Adverse reactions were successfully treated during 510 min in all patients with Epinephrine (0.5 mcg/kg bolus). One procedure was interrupted due to prolonged hemodynamic instability. 10 patients required prolonged vasopressor support in early postoperative period. In 3 cases children had an acute ishemic stroke, which was confirmed by MRI. Conclusions: Adverse cardiorespiratory reactions are commonly observed in SOAC for retinoblastoma. We believe that the adverse clinical signs represent an autonomic reflex response and all patients should be considered atrisk. Reactions occur only during second or subsequent procedures and can be lifethreatening. Anesthesiologists must be vigilant for adverse reactions and deal with them quickly and effectively. However, further investigations are needed to improve the understanding of the manifestations, management, and clinical significance of the described oculocardiac reflex. O-081 Fertility Preservation After Ovarian Transposition in Pediatric, Adolescent and Young Adult Female Cancer Patient J. VALDUGA 1, L. CLAUDE2, C. ROUSSETJABLONSKI2, With increasing survival rates, preserve fertility of young patients treated for cancer is essential. Ovarian transposition (OT) can preserve the ovarian function from radiotherapyrelated damage in pubertal women. However, little data are available about the possibilities of pregnancy after OT, especially when performed in pre or peripubertal period. Design/Methods: A retrospective analysis of women who underwent an OT before the age of 26 yrs between 1990 and 2015 was perfomed. Data on puberty, menstruations, pregnancies and ovarian reserve were collected. Results: An OT was performed in 32 patients before a pelvic or craniospinal irradiation, associated to chemotherapy in 28 cases. Mean age at the time of the analysis was 24.4 yrs. Median followup was 7.1 yrs. The mean age at the time of the OT was 15.6 years (95% CI = [14.017.2]) and 9 were prepurbetal. Only 3 patients underwent a second procedure in order to replace the transposed ovary(ies) in their original position. The incidence of amenorrhea after the end of treatment was 47%. All prepubertal patients at the time of the OT had a spontaneous menarche. Among 10 patients who have attempted, 6 obtained a pregnancy, 2 of them after an OT performed in the peripubertal period and after pelvic irradiation > 20 Gy for 3. The rate of spontaneous abortion was 33%. Endocrine function was preserved in 82% of the 13 nulligeste evaluated patients but the ovarian reserve was altered in two thirds of the cases. Conclusions: These results show that OT during cancer treatment is possible and safe in young females including prepubertal, to preserve ovarian function even in younger patients. Pregnancies can occur spontaneously, even without resorting to detransposition. Further studies are needed to evaluate fertility after OT performed in prepubertal period, in order to elaborate recommendations concerning the indications of this technique. O-082 Pain in Pediatric Cancer Patients Receiving Chemotherapy in an Outpatient Setting E. Michiels 1, F. Van Loon1, J. Van Amstel1, G. Elmont1, M. Zwaan1 1ErasmusMC/Sophia Children's Hospital, Pediatric Oncology, Rotterdam, The Netherlands Background/Objectives: Pediatric cancer patients currently spend more time at home. Only a few studies have studied pain in children receiving chemotherapy in outpatient clinics.Therefore, the objective of this study was to explore if children experience pain when receiving chemotherapy at the outpatient clinic, the severity of the pain and its effect on quality of life (QoL). Design/Methods: In this longitudinal observational study, children visiting the outpatient clinic received 4 pain questionnaires, covering the last day before and the first 3 days following the outpatient chemotherapy administration. Children were asked to complete at least 3 times the set of 4 questionnaires. Minimum time between 2 sets of questionnaires was one week. The validated Brief Pain Inventory, Dutch Version was used. For children aged 04 years (for which parents completed the questionnaire) and 918 years the numeric rating scale was used to measure pain intensity. Children aged 49 years used the Faces Pain ScaleRevised. Demographic data, use of pain medication and effect of the pain on QoL were documented. Results: Seventyfive participants completed 1,028 questionnaires. Diagnoses included ALL brain tumor (20%) and other malignancies (12%). In 40.3% of the questionnaires pain was reported by 82.6% of the children. Clinically significant pain, defined as a score of > 4 on 'average' pain or a score > 7 on 'worst' pain, was noticed in 45 patients (60.0%) and in 21.0% of the questionnaires. Twentyone percent of children experienced pain at least 50% of the measurements. In 32.4% of the questionnaires in which clinically significant pain was reported, no analgesic medication was used. The higher the pain scores, the more pronounced its effect on QoL. Conclusions: Pain is still very prevalent in children being treated in an outpatient setting, and the effect on their QoL is significant. Pain treatment is still suboptimal. O-083 Predictors of Specialized Pediatric Palliative Care Involvement and Impact on Patterns of EndofLife Care in Children with Cancer: A PopulationBased Study S. Gupta 1, S. Rinku2, R. Adam3, K. Nelson3, Y. Liu2, Children, Haematology/Oncology, Toronto, Canada; 2Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, Cancer Research Program, Toronto, Canada; 3The Hospital for Sick Children, Paediatric Advanced Care Team, Toronto, Canada; 4Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Pediatric Palliative Care Outreach Team, Ottawa, Canada; 5London Health Sciences Centre, Unit, Toronto, Canada; 8Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, Health Services Research Program, Toronto, Canada; 9DanaFarber Cancer Institute, Pediatric Palliative Care, Boston, USA Background/Objectives: Children with cancer are at risk of receiving highintensity (HI) endoflife (EOL) care with associated high symptom burden. The impact of palliative care (PC) delivered by generalists or of specialized pediatric palliative care (SPPC) on EOL care patterns is unknown, with previous studies limited by small sample sizes or low response rates. Design/Methods: We assembled a retrospective cohort of all Ontario children with cancer who died between 20002012 and who received care through a pediatric institution with a SPPC team and a clinical PC database. Patients were linked to populationbased healthcare data capturing inpatient, outpatient, and emergency visits. Clinical PC databases identified patients receiving SPPC. Remaining patients were categorized as having received either general PC (GPC) or no PC depending on the presence of PCassociated physician billing or inpatient codes. We determined predictors of SPPC involvement, and whether either SPPC or GPC was associated with HIEOL outcomes: ICU admission <30 days from death, mechanical ventilation <14 days from death, or in hospital death. Sensitivity analyses excluded treatmentrelated mortality (TRM) cases. Results: 572 patients met inclusion criteria. Children less likely to receive SPPC services included those with hematologic cancers [odds ratio (OR) 0.33, 95th confidence 0.44, 95CI 0.230.81; 95CI 0.400.52; p<0.0001). In multivariate analysis, SPPC was associated with a 3fold decrease in the odds of an EOL ICU admission (OR 0.32, 95CI 0.180.57), while GPC had no impact. Similar associations were seen with all other HIEOL indicators. Excluding TRM had little impact. Conclusions: SPPC, but not GPC, is associated with lower intensity care at EOL. Access to SPPC remains uneven. Without randomized trials, these results provide the strongest evidence to date supporting the creation of SPPC teams, and can be used to support advocacy and policy efforts. Free Paper Session: Soft Tissue Sarcomas O-084 Revisiting Risk Stratification in Patients with Localized Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS): A Report from the European Paediatric Soft Tissue Sarcoma Study Group (EPSSG) G. Italy; 2Children's Hospital for Wales Heath Park, Cardiff, United Kingdom; Netherlands; 6Royal Marsden Hospital, Haifa, Israel; 14Azienda stratification system of the recently closed RMS2005 protocol, 6 factors were used to define the risk group of children with localized RMS and assign treatment: histology, IRS Group, nodal involvement, patients age, tumor site and size. We reevaluated the value of this stratification, adding FOXO1 fusion status, in preparation of the next EpSSG protocol. Design/Methods: A total of 991 patients enrolled from 10/2005 to 6/2013 with >3 yrs follow up were included in the analysis. The initial step was a validation of the current system, examining its accuracy to discriminate groups of patients with different prognosis. This was followed by a multivariable analysis in order to select independent prognostic variables. Finally the role of PAX3/PAX7FOXO1 fusion status was evaluated in a cohort of 660 patients with the available data. Results: 3yrs EFS was 94.3, 75.8, 66.8 and 52.8 for low, standard, high and very high risk groups, respectively and all risk factors within the stratification system had prognostic value within the univariate analysis. On multivariable analysis IRS group and tumor site were identified as independent risk factors. An interaction between tumor size (>5cm) and patient age (>10yrs) emerged discriminating patients with worst prognosis When fusion status was included in the model a better risk determination was evident. Conclusions: the current stratification system has demonstrated good discrimination and calibration in a new cohort of patients. It will be adopted in the next EpSSG protocol with the inclusion of FOXO1 status instead of histology.

O-085 Does Early Detection with offTherapy Surveillance Imaging Improve Survival in Pediatric Rhabdomyosarcoma Patients? The European Experience B. Vaarwerk 1, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; 2Institut Curie, Department of Pediatric adolescent young adult Oncology, Paris, France; 3Children's Hospital for Wales, Department of Pediatric Oncology, Cardiff, United Kingdom; 4Padova Padova, Ormond Street of Radiology, London, United Kingdom; 6Emma Children's Hospital Academic Medical Centre, Pediatric Radiology, Amsterdam, The Netherlands Background/Objectives: After completion of treatment patients with localized rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) are subject to intensive radiologic tumor surveillance, however the clinical significance of surveillance is unclear. We retrospectively analyzed the value of offtherapy surveillance, by comparing survival of patients in whom relapse was detected by routine imaging to patients in whom relapse was first suspected by symptoms. Design/Methods: We studied patients with relapsed RMS, after completion of treatment for localized RMS, treated in large pediatric oncology hospitals in France, the Netherlands, United Kingdom and Italy and enrolled in the SIOPMMT95 (19952004), ICGRMS96 (19962004) or EpSSGRMS2005 (20052013) studies. Survival time after relapse was compared by logrank test between patients in whom relapse was detected by routine imaging (imaging group) and patients in whom relapse was first suspected by clinical symptoms (symptoms group). Results: Preliminary data of 139 patients with relapsed RMS (treated in France and the Netherlands) revealed 52 patients (37.4%) in the imaging group and 86 patients (61.9%) in the symptoms group (1 patient missing). Median followup time after relapse was 7.3 years for postrelapse survival [95% CI] was 45.2% in the imaging group and 50.1% [39.161.1%] for patients in the symptoms group (p=0.93). Conclusions: Although systematic routine imaging is standard of care after treatment for RMS, these analyses indicate that the majority of patients with relapsed RMS are detected because of clinical symptoms. Furthermore, no survival advantage was observed for patients in whom relapse was detected before the emergence of clinical symptoms. These preliminary results show that the value offtherapy surveillance is controversial, particularly since repeated imaging also entails potential harm (psychological impact, risk of anesthesia). Final results, including data of patients from the United Kingdom and Italy, will be presented. O-086 Outcome of Patients with Group I Embryonal Rhabdomyosarcoma in the EPSSG RMS 2005 Study C. Jenney2, Kingdom; Children's Hospital-Academic Medical Center University of Amsterdam, Department of Pediatric Oncology, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; 5Oslo University Hospital, Department for Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, Oslo, Norway; 6Fondazione IRCCS Kingdom; 11Istituto Pediatric Oncology Division, Padova, Italy Background/Objectives: To evaluate the reduction of the burden of treatment in patients enrolled in the EpSSG RMS 2005 protocol after initial microscopic complete surgery for embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS). Design/Methods: All patients with ERMS with initial microscopic complete resection (group I), lympnode (LN) negative, were prospectively enrolled in lowrisk group A (age <10 years and tumour size < 5 cm) or in standardrisk group B (age > 10 year or tumour size >5 cm). Regional LN were investigated with imaging without systematic surgical sampling. Group A patients received 8 courses of vincristin and actinomycinD (VA) for 22 weeks while group B received 4 courses of ifosfamide, vincristin and actinomycineD (IVA) plus 5 VA for a total of 25 weeks. No radiotherapy was planned. OS and EFS were calculated using the KaplanMeier method. Results: From December 2005 to April 2015, 149 patients (139 males) were enrolled in the study, 59 (39%) in group A and 90 (61%) in group B. Tumour location was 134 genitourinary non bladderprostate (129 paratesticular, 3 uterus, 1 vagina, 1 vulva), 7 extremities, 3 bladderprostate, 1 head&neck, 1 orbit and 3 others. After pathological review, one case of nodular fasciitis was excluded from the analysis. Median followup was 44 months. Eight of the 9 relapses occurred in group B patients and 7 were older than 10 years and had paratesticular tumour. Three died of the disease. The 3 yrs EFS and OS were 91% (95% CI and 95.2% for group B. Conclusions: Lowrisk ERMS patient treated without alkylating agents and radiotherapy have excellent survivals. The place of systematic RPLND and/or modern imaging to evaluate regional nodal involvement in patients > 10 years with paratesticular ERMS requires further discussion. O-087 Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheet Tumors (MPNST) in Children and Adolescents: Report of the European Pediatric Soft Tissue Sarcoma Group (EPSSG) NRSTS2005 Study M. van Noesel 1Princess M\u00e1xima Center for Pediatric Dept of Solid tumors, Utrecht, The Netherlands; 2Institut Curie, Pediatric Adolescent Young Adult Department, Paris, France; Manchester Children's Hospital, Pediatric Oncology, Padova, Italy; 8Royal Hospital, Department of Pathology, Manchester, Hematology Milan, Italy Background/Objectives: MPNST are the third most frequent pediatric soft tissue sarcoma. In 50% MPNST is associated with Neurofibromatosis type 1. Retrospective studies showed poor outcome and poor response to conventional chemotherapy. Here, we present the results for patients with localized MPNST enrolled in the prospective EpSSG NRSTS2005 study with a risk adapted strategy. Design/Methods: A cohort of 59 localized MPNST patients from 8 European countries were treated in 3 treatment groups: 1. Surgical group (R0 5 3 g/m\u00b2/day, doxorubicin 37.5 mg/m\u00b2/day, chemotherapy response was complete (CR) in 6.9%; partial (PR) in 10.3%; minor (MR) in 31.0%; no progression in 34.5%. Total response to chemotherapy (CR + PR + MR) is 47.2%. The 3yrs EFS for the surgical group was 100%; radiation group 67%; Perioperative group <40%. Outcome of 55/59 evaluable patients with a median followup of 39.5 months: 27 alive in 1st CR, 9 alive with disease and 19 died. The 3yrs EFS was 56.1 (95%CI 41.068.7) and in 47% of patients. Conclusions: Outcome of pediatric MPNST patients is poor and the results of this prospective, interational treatment protocols is comparable or slightly better to historic, retrospective studies. Novel treatment strategies are necessary to improve outcome in MPNST. O-088 Intraperitoneal Radioimmunotherapy for Desmoplastic Small Round Cell a PHASE I Study (Clinicaltrials.Gov Identifier York, USA; Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Radiology, New York, USA; 3Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Medical Physics, New York, USA Background/Objectives: Desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT), a rare sarcoma of adolescents and young adults, has a longterm survival of <20% despite aggressive multimodality therapy, warranting a search for novel treatments. The murine monoclonal IgG1 antibody 8H9 recognizes cell surface antigen 4IgB7H3 and binds to 96% of DSRCTs with restricted normal tissue reactivity. DSRCT recurrences often present as multifocal peritoneal implants. We hypothesized that intraperitoneal (IP) radioimmunotherapy (RIT) by virtue of prolonged residence time and slow transfer to the circulation, may selectively target IP DSRCT. Design/Methods: We conducted a phase I study of radioiodinated 8H9 to evaluate toxicity, pharmacokinetics, biodistribution and efficacy. Cohorts of 36 patients were treated with escalated doses of IP 131I8H9. A prior dose of 2mCi 124I8H9 IP was used to acquire PET images and biodistribution data. Toxicity was monitored clinically and biochemically. Pharmacokinetics was studied using serial blood draws. Results: Thirtyseven DSRCT patients were treated at doses of 3090mCi/m2. Maximum tolerated dose was not reached; there were no doselimiting toxicities. Adverse events (n=1 each) were transient: grade 3 neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. Blood and peritoneal halftimes were 32.5h and 14.6h respectively. Mean projected absorbed doses to blood, kidney, liver, lung and spleen were 0.7,1.72,1.92,0.64 and 1.03 rad/mCi 131I8H9 respectively (n=12 dose was 80mCi/m2. Progressionfree survival (PFS) for patients undergoing gross total resection followed by RIT and wholeabdominal radiotherapy was 17.9\u00b13 months. 11/20 patients survive PF at a median of 29 months postRIT. In contrast patients with gross residual disease preRIT (n=13) had PFS of 3.3\u00b11.4 months. Overall survival was also better for the former (p<0.05). Conclusions: 124I8H9directed radioimmunoPET successfully determined biodistribution, wholebody and organ exposure. 131I8H9 IP RIT had a satisfactory safety profile and activity against micrometastatic DSRCT. A phase II trial will commence shortly. O-089 Genomic Index in Pediatric Synovial Sarcoma (Synobio Study), Final Results the European Pediatric Soft Tissue Sarcoma Group (EPSSG) Experience D. Orbach 1, V. Mosseri2, D. Histopathology, Manchester, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: A genomic index (GI) tool using array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) on tumor cells correlates with genomic instability and has recently been developed. GI has emerged as independent prognostic factor associated with the risk of metastatic relapse in adult synovial sarcoma (SS). The aim is to assess the role of GI in pediatric patients with SS. Design/Methods: All pediatric/adolescent/young adults' (<25 years) with localized SS (central pathological review or specific fusion transcript (SYTSSX)) prospectively included in the European EpSSGNRSTS05 protocol (EUDRACT200500113931) with a contributive aCGH were selected. Definition of GI was A2/C, where A is the total number of alterations (segmental gains and losses) and C is the number of involved chromosomes on aCGH results. GI1 group corresponds to cases with no alterations (flat profile, GI=0) and GI2 group cases with many alterations (complex CGH profile; GI1). Results: Samples were available from 62 patients. The median age of the cohort was 13 years (range: 424). The commonest primary site was extremities (69%). Patients received either surgery only (23%), adjuvant therapy (16%) or perioperative therapy with surgery and radiotherapy (61%). In summary, 54.8% were GI1 group, and 45.2% GI2. After a median follow up of 60 months (range: 0.1112), 10 tumor events occurred and 5 patients died. Respectively for GI1 vs. GI2 groups, 5year event free survival (EFS) rates were 93.8\u00b14.2% vs. 66.4\u00b19.8% and 74.1\u00b19.1% In multivariate analysis, GI status as adjusted for IRSgroup, site and tumor size remains independent prognostic for EFS with a relative risk (RR) of 6.3[1.331.3] (p<0.015) and RR for MFS is 4.7 [0.925.2] (p=0.051). Conclusions: GI may explain aggressive behavior of some pediatric SS. Although tumor events were rare, high GI selected patients with a poorer outcome that may require therapy intensification in future protocols.

A Report from the International bMMRD Consortium P. Angelini 1, M. Sabel2, V. Larouche3, South Wales, North Adelaide, Australia; 12University Medical Center HamburgEppendorf, Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hamburg, Germany; 13Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Research Institute, Philadelphia, USA; 14University Clevelan Medical Centre, Haematology adn Oncology, USA; 18Children's Winnipeg, Canada; Toronto, Canada Background/Objectives: Biallelic mismatch repair disease (bMMRD) is the most aggressive cancer predisposition syndrome in which patients succumb to multiple hypermutated cancers during childhood. Since hypermutated cancers have responded to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), we treated patients with recurrent hypermutant cancers with ICI to assess toxicity, tumour response and survival. Design/Methods: As a part of the international bMMRD consortium collaboration, bMMRD patients with recurrent/progressive cancers received nivolumab or pembrolizumab. Clinical data was prospectively collected. Tumour mutation analysis and neoantigen formation analysis were performed. Results: Twenty patients (11 males, median age at starting ICI 11.9 years) with 25 cancers received ICI. All tumors were hypermutant (>10mut/MB) and 12 were ultrahypermutant (>100mut/MB). Nine patients developed acute \"flare\" symptoms following the first ICI administration. These included 8 patients with brain tumors and heavy burden of disease and one bone metastasis from colon cancer. All these patients required steroid use and 6 died within a few days or weeks after this first administration. Only 2 patients developed autoimmune phenomena related to ICI. Of patients with evidence of disease, objective responses were observed in 5/11 brain tumors and 4/4 metastatic extracranial tumours. One year survival is 62+/13% for the whole cohort and 52+/12% for gliomas. All 5 patients with extraCNS solid tumors are alive and in continuous response. At a median of 7.2 (319) months, 12 patients are still alive and on therapy. Conclusions: This is the first cohort of prospectively followed patients with bMMRD and hypermutant cancers treated with ICI. The encouraging initial responses and prolonged survival in this cohort warrants a prospective genetic based study of ICI in children. The role of \"flare reactions\" following initiation of treatment needs to be further investigated. O-091 Preclinical Efficacy and Safety Profile of CD19CAR+ T Cells Engineered with Sleeping Beauty Gene Transfer for the Treatment of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia C.F. Magnani1, C. Cappuzzello1, HSRTIGET, Safety of Gene Therapy and Insertional Mutagenesis Research Unit, Milan, Italy Background/Objectives: Adoptive transfer of autologous CD19specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)T cells engineered by viral vectors demonstrated unexpected positive results, achieving durable responseS in relapsed and refractory patients affected by Blineage leukemias. We recently established a platform for nonviral gene manipulation of CytokineInduced Killer (CIK) cells, in compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). In this study, we evaluated the feasibility and reproducibility of a GMPcompliant protocol, and the preclinical efficacy and safety of SB modified CARCIKCD19 cells. Design/Methods: With an improved SB transposon platform, we genetically modified CIK cells to express the CAR specific for acute lymphoblastic leukemia CD19+ blasts and evaluated their preclinical efficacy and safety in vitro and in vivo. Results: Large scale manufacturing process was verified starting from 45 ml of peripheral blood or, alternatively, 3060X10^6 PBMC isolated from Buffy Coats, reaching stable expression of CD19CAR (62.425%\u00b16.399). Modified cells displayed a specific and effective cytotoxicity, IL2 and IFNgamma production and proliferation towards primary tumors. We manufactured three lots in an academic Cell Factory, authorized by Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco. The median expression of CD3+CD19CAR + cells was 46.90% (range 31.27% - 65.45%). CARCIKCD19 cells showed a dosedependent antitumor response and persisted in a xenograft mouse model of common BCPALL, bearing the feature of a Phlike gene rearrangement (PAX5/AUTS2), and in a survival model with Daudicell lymphoma. CARCIKCD19 cells induced complete eradication of disseminated tumor. Infusion of CARCIKCD19 cells proved to be safe and well tolerated. The infused cells persisted in time in the hematopoietic and postinjection perfused organs. Highly polyclonal distribution of Integration Sites in CARCIKCD19 cell product was demonstrated. Conclusions: CARCIKCD19 may offer a valid and sustainable alternative to patientderived viral approach for patients with r/r B cell malignancies after HSCT. This study provides the proofofconcept for designing phase I/II study for relapsing and refractory ALL post Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation. O-092 BAFF Receptor (BAFFR) CarRedirected T Cells as a Novel Tool to Treat High Risk BCell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (BALL) N. Turazzi 1, G. Pediatrics, Monza, Department of Biomedicine, Basel, Switzerland Background/Objectives: Bcell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (BALL) is the most common malignancy in children (80%). CD19targeting approaches paved the way for the treatment of relapsed/refractory ALL. However, the emergence of CD19negative relapses in 1030% of treated patients has been reported. Receptor of Bcell Activating Factor (BAFFR) is fundamental for Bcell maturation and survival with an expression restricted to mature B cells while not on Bcell precursors and plasmablasts. Recent studies reported the overexpression of BAFFR in Bcell malignancies, including BALL. Moreover, leukemic cells express both BAFF and BAFFR suggesting an autocrine signaling loop. BAFF is also expressed in leukemic niche supporting proliferation and survival of BALL blasts. In this study, we aimed to develop a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)mediated approach targeting BAFFR molecule. Design/Methods: To target BAFFR molecule, we developed antiBAFFR.CARs that differ for the inversion of the VH and VL and the length of the spacer domain. Cytokineinduced Killer (CIK) cells, an heterogeneous population enriched in highly cytotoxic CD3+CD56+ cells, were engineered with an improved Sleeping Beauty platform and used as effector population. Results: We showed that BAFFR expression in BALL primary samples is maintained at relapse. AntiBAFFR.CARs were stably expressed and the shortest VHVL.CAR exerted the highest antileukemic activity (average 60%) and cytokine release (8.9\u00b12% of IFN and 16.4\u00b15.5% of IL2 producing cells) towards NALM6in vitro. Importantly, we detected specific lysis of primary BALL blasts (65.6\u00b14.5%). Combining the INVsh.CAR with CD19.CAR, we detected a superior antitumor activity towards NALM6 and primary blasts (78.1\u00b16.9% and 72.2\u00b12.9% of lysis respectively) compared to single population per se. Furthermore, we demonstrated the ability of the INVsh.CAR to lysate blasts collected from CD19negative relapse. Conclusions: Taken together, these findings make this receptor a safe and attractive target for a second line immunotherapy in case of CD19negative relapse or for a double targeted approach. O-093 Specific Targeting of Acute Myeloid Leukemia by the use of Engineered CIK (CytokineInduced Killer) Cells Expressing the AntiCD33 Chimeric Antigen MB, Italy Background/Objectives: Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is still associated with a dismal prognosis. Immunotherapy employing T cells redirected with Chimeric Antigen Receptors (CARs) could represent a valid alternative to current strategies. CD33 is broadly expressed on AML blasts, representing a suitable antigen to be targeted with CART cells. The aim of the study is to preclinically evaluate efficacy and safety profiles of CD33.CAR redirected Cytokine Induced Killer (CIK) cells alone and in combination with standard chemotherapeutic agents. Design/Methods: We generated CD33.CARexpressing CIK cells through the non viral SleepingBeauty transposon system, starting from healthy mononuclear cells and primary AML samples. The in vitro antiAML activity of CD33.CARCIK cells has been assessed by cytotoxicity, proliferation and cytokine production assays upon challenge with AML samples. The in vivo efficacy of CD33.CAR CIK cells is evaluated in NSG mice transplanted with MA9NRas AML cells and primary samples. Moreover we investigate the potential benefit of combining CD33.CAR CIK cells with standard AML induction therapy. Results: CD33.CARCIK cells resulted in a potent antileukemic activity, in terms of specific killing, proliferation and cytokine production. We observed that the already established \"5+3\" induction protocol significantly reduced the leukemic burden from around 20% to 0.1% in the bone marrow of MA9NRas cell grafted mice. Since the disease was not totally eradicated, we are currently investigating the efficacy of the CD33.CARCIK cells on chemotherapy resistant/residual AML cells. Preliminary data have shown a survival advantage when adding CD33.CARCIK cells on the top of chemotherapy. Conclusions: Having demonstrated the in vitro antileukemic activity of SBmodified CD33.CARCIK cells, we aim to further evaluate their efficacy in vivo against chemotherapy resistant/residual AML cells to corroborate our initial observations. Envisaging a safer clinical translation, transient CAR expression, by CD33.CAR mRNA, is under investigation, to limit the potential longterm offtarget effect on normal hematopoietic stem/myeloid progenitor of Acute Myeloid Leukaemia Using CostimulatoryOnly Chimeric Antigen Receptors Provides Efficacy without Toxicity J. Fisher 1, P. Abramowski1, N.D. Wisidagamage Don1, J. Anderson1 1UCL Institute of Child Health, Cancer section, London, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: Ontarget offtumour toxicity constrains the development of immunotherapies targeting highly expressed tumour antigens, producing challenging and sometimes fatal toxicity. The strength of CD3containing chimeric antigen receptors expressed in T cells is also a limitation as it offers no escape to antigenexpressing healthy cells. V2+ T cells differentiate between healthy and transformed cells in an MHCindependent manner determined by differing expression of phosphoantigen on stressed versus healthy cells. Their native TCR is therefore not redundant in the tumour context and need not be replaced with an artificial construct. We sought to determine the efficacy and safety of V2+ T cells expressing \"costimulation only\" CARs in a preclinical model. Design/Methods: To demonstrate the lack of ontarget offtumour toxicity, antiCD33 \"costimulation only\" CARs expressed in V2+ T cells were compared to a conventional second generation antiCD33 CAR (CD3328). Cytotoxicity against CD33+ AML cell lines, healthy myeloid cells and myeloid progenitors was assessed. Phenotype was assessed by flow cytometry and secondary expansion potential was determined by coculture with irradiated target cells. Mechanistic information was obtained using cellfree systems to determine cytokine production and signalling profiles by PhosFlow following stimulus of CD3, CAR or both. Results: T cells expressing a \"costimulationonly\" CAR retain antitumour cytotoxicity but show no activity against healthy cells which do not engage the TCR. Clinically useful numbers of cells can be generated from a 100ml blood draw. Precise control of cytokine production and activatory signalling is achievable with selective stimulus of CAR and/or TCR. \"Costimulationonly\" CAR expressing T cells have a phenotype favourable for adoptive transfer with significantly lower exhaustion marker expression than cells expressing a conventional CD3CD28 CAR, and are capable of mounting a secondary expansion following antigen rechallenge. Conclusions: This approach offers a means of safely recapitulating immunotherapy against tumour antigens previously rejected on grounds of toxicity. O-095 Resistance Mechanisms of Rhabdomyosarcomas to SimonKeller 1, A. Seils1, P.D.A. Marx1 1University Hospital Mannheim, Institute of Pathology, Mannheim, Germany Background / Objectives: Background: Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common soft tissue malignancy of childhood and adolescence. Outcome of children with advanced RMS is still poor. Immunotherapies may offer new perspectives for highrisk patients. Design / Methods: Objective: To reveal tumor cellintrinsic resistance mechanisms of RMS cell lines, RMS redirected cytotoxic T cells expressing a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) with specificity for the fetal acetylcholine receptor (fAChR), which is an almost RMSspecific, tumor associated antigen, were used. Futhermore sensitivity of RMS tumor cells against Cytokine induced killer cells (CIK) and NK cells were tested. RMSdirected chimeric Tcells blood lymphocytes with fAChR specific CAR. CIK and NK cells were enriched by cultivation. Killing efficiency of the named immune cells and survival of RMS cells were determined by apoptosis tests after coculture. RMS were checked for expression of antiapoptotic genes and immunosuppressive as well as costimulatory receptors using Western Blot and qRTPCR. Results: fAChR specific chimeric Tcells showed RMS tumor cell lysis in vitro and in vivo, but were less efficient. RMS cells were resistant to IFN, TNF, FASL and TRAIL. Molecular features associated with resistance of RMS to cTCs are (a) lack of essential costimulators for tumour T cell interaction and expression of inhibitory molecules like B7H1 and B7H3; (b) overexpression of inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family members in RMS cells and tissue. Inhibition of IAPs through siRNA or pharmacological substances improved killing efficiency by chimeric T cells in vitro and in vivo. The mentioned resistance mechanisms were 'spontaneously' circumvented by CIK and NK cells to which RMS cells were highly sensitive. Conclusions: Blockade of antiapoptotic mechanisms and use NK and CIK cellmediated therapeutic strategies as well as RMSspecific chimeric T cells should be evaluated as therapeutic strategy in RMS. Free Paper Session: PPO I O-096 Interventions to Support Parents Whose Child is Being Treated for Cancer: Lessons Learned from Research on Existing Programs S. Sultan 1, D. Ogez1, K. Peloquin2, R. Canada Background/Objectives: Parents of children treated for cancer are vulnerable to a variety of issues including heightened distress and lack of control. Distress during treatment has been identified as a risk factor for future distress and for increased difficulties for the family and the child in the long run. To help parents during treatments, manualized interventions have been developed and applied with this population.This presentation will identify, review and criticize existing manualized intervention. We concentrate on program development processes and criteria of quality of psychological treatments to identify previous achievements as well as avenues for future improvements. Design/Methods: A systematic search was run in databases (electronic and manual) to identify existing programs corresponding to inclusion criteria. The ORBIT framework was used to evaluate and compare program development processes. Criteria from the APA task force on psychological treatments were used to evaluate the consistency or coherence of programs. Results: Ten manualized interventions (24 reports) were identified and coded. Some programs yielded clinical effects (e.g. Bright Ideas, SCCIP). An indepth analysis revealed that lack of clinical signal may be due to a variety of factors. A subset of programs (N=4) lack precise concept definition, explicit model of change and defined target. Social validity and acceptability was seldom documented prior efficacy testing. Importantly, dosage or treatment intensity was never systematically studied. Conclusions: Fine methodological design is necessary for program testing but is not sufficient for appropriate program development. Systematic psychosocial interventions to help parents should build on one another and therefore explicitly refer to sound models of change. Models of change should also translate more clearly in the format, tools, and interaction style of programs. Future programs should also address underserved populations (e.g. fathers) and optimize contact rates (e.g. ehealth initiatives). O-097 Child Versus Parent Perceptions of Parenting In Childhood Cancer Surivivors and Healthy Peers S. Schepers 1, A. Long1, K. Russell1, S. Phipps1 1St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Psychology, Memphis, USA Background/Objectives: A pediatric cancer diagnosis is a challenging event that may have an impact on how children and parents perceive parentchild relationships. The aims of this study were to (a) examine possible differences in child and parent perceptions of parenting between childhood cancer survivors and healthy peers, and (b) determine the concordance between child and parent perceptions of parenting. Design/Methods: Participants were children aged 821 years (N=206 children with a history of cancer, N=119 healthy peers), and one of their parents. All patients were 3 years from diagnosis (M=7.06, SD=4.25). Both children (Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI)) and parents (Parenting Relationship Questionnaire (PRQ)) reported on their perceptions of parenting. Two separate MANCOVA's (PBI and PRQ) were conducted to determine possible differences between the cancer and the comparison group, while controlling for child age/gender, and parent SES/gender. Concordance between the PBI scales of parental care and overprotection and the PRQ scales of involvement, attachment, communication, parenting confidence, and relational frustration was assessed with Pearson correlation coefficients. Results: Survivors of childhood cancer (p=.868) and their parents (p=.202) did not differ in their perceptions of parenting compared to healthy peers. The magnitude of effect between parentchild dyads was not significantly different for childhood cancer survivors and healthy peers. The child's report of a caring parentchild relationship was positively and significantly associated with parentreported involvement, attachment, communication, and parenting confidence (r's ranged from .20 to .30), and negatively associated with relational frustration (r=.36). Children that perceived their parents as overprotective had parents that reported significantly more relational frustration (r=.24). Conclusions: A history of childhood cancer does not appear to influence parenting behavior, as perceived by both children and parents. However, children who experienced their parents to be overprotective had more frustrations in the parentchild relationship, which might warrant future interventions. O-098 Parental Functioning after Induction Treatment of Their Child with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia L.M.H. 1, N. Amsterdam, The Netherlands; 2Princess M\u00e1xima Center for pediatric oncology, The Netherlands; 3Emma Children's Hospital Academic Medical department, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; 4Sophia Children's Hospital Erasmus Medical Department Rotterdam, The Netherlands; 5Amalia Children's Hospital Radboud University oncology, Nijmegen, The Netherlands; 6Emma Children's Hospital Academic Medical of pediatric oncology, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; 7Beatrix Children's Hospital University Medical oncology, Groningen, The Netherlands; 8Dutch Childhood Oncology Group, The Hague, The Netherlands Background/Objectives: Parental and child quality of life (QoL) are bidirectionally related. To improve QoL of families, parental functioning should also be addressed. This study aims to describe parental QoL, sleep and distress and to investigate predictors of parental QoL in childhood ALL. Design/Methods: Parents of children aged 218 years, treated according to the Dutch Childhood Oncology Group ALL11 treatment protocol, were included (expected final sample size n=105). Parental functioning (QoL, sleep and distress) was assessed shortly after end of induction treatment with questionnaires (Short Form12, Medical Outcome Study Sleep Scale, Distress Thermometer). Scores were compared to healthy norms. QoL and sleep scores 1 and 2 standard deviation (SD) different from the norm reflected clinical relevance. A distress score of 4 or higher indicated clinical distress. Predictors for parental QoL were selected with backward regression analyses. Results: Ninety parents (mean age 38.4\u00b16.0 years, 77.8% mothers) of 90 children (mean age 7.0\u00b14.4 years, 43.3% girls), were included (response rate 66%). Parents reported significantly lower mental QoL, more overall sleep problems, and more distress (P<0.001). Physical QoL was not different from norms. Clinically relevant lower mental QoL was found in 45.6% (SD<1) and 18.9% (SD<2) of the parents and clinically relevant sleep problems in 52.2% (SD>1) and 24.4% (SD>2), compared to 15.9% and 2.3% in healthy norms, respectively. Clinical distress was present in 74.7% of the parents compared to 41.2% in the norm. Lower child age, higher parental age, more parental sleep problems and more parental distress predicted lower mental QoL (explained variance 53%). Male child gender and more child sleep problems predicted lower physical QoL (explained variance 10%). Conclusions: Parents of children with ALL are at risk for a lower QoL and impaired psychosocial functioning. Aiming to improve functioning of the whole family, interventions targeting parents at risk are warranted. Acknowledgements: Grant sponsor: Dutch Cancer Society. O-099 Improvements in Psychological Adjustment in Siblings and Parents of Children with Cancer after Participation in A Sibling Group Intervention: A Randomized Control Trial B. Maru Atenafu2, F. Schulte3, P. Nathan4, K. Hancock5 1Hospital for Sick Health Toronto, Canada; 3Alberta Haematology/Oncology, Toronto, Canada; 5Hospital for Sick Children, Pscyhology, Toronto, Canada Background/Objectives: Pediatric cancer diagnosis and treatment can affect psychological adjustment in parents and healthy siblings. Systematic, rigorous assessment of interventions targeting the psychosocial needs of these siblings are rare. Our objective was to assess the effects of a manualized group intervention, Siblings Coping Together (SCT), on siblings' and parents' adjustment and to explore factors related to intervention effect. Design/Methods: We conducted blocked randomized controlled trial (RCT) with two arms, the experimental arm (EG) and an attention control group (CG). 75 healthy siblings (average age 11 years, range 718) of children with cancer who were >3 months from diagnosis participated. Both groups had eight weekly twohour sessions. EG followed SCT's educational, social, and therapeutic problemsolving plan through games and crafts; CG consisted of games and crafts only. Siblings selfreported on symptoms of depression and anxiety; parent selfreported on symptoms of anxiety, at baseline, after intervention ended, and 3 months later. Multivariable analyses with a mixed effects model were used to examine the intervention effect over time, controlling for covariates (e.g. gender, on/off ill child's treatment). Results: A significant group by gender interaction with the total depression scores indicated female siblings in the EG reported significantly lower scores than girls in the CG across times (p < 0.05, h2 =0.071). This was also the case for the subscales of ineffectiveness (p < 0.01, h2 =0.096) and anhedonia (p <0.05, h2 =0.064). A significant difference on group by gender interaction was also found for total anxiety scores for parents (p =0.002, h2 =0.159), with parents of females in the EG reporting lower scores than equivalent parents in the CG. Conclusions: A group intervention for siblings of children with cancer can result in improvements in psychological adjustment for both siblings and parents, particularly if the sibling is female. This research was funded by the Canadian C17 Network. O-100 Changes in Quality of Life in Siblings of Children with Cancer after Group Intervention Participation: A Randomized Control Trial M. Barrera 1, E. Atenafu2, P. Nathan3, F. Schulte4, K. Hancock1 1Hospital for Sick Canada; 2University Health Network, Biostatistics, Toronto, Toronto, Canada; 4Alberta Children's Hospital, Psychology, Calgary, Canada Background/Objectives: Pediatric cancer diagnosis and treatment can result in reduced quality of life (QOL) in healthy siblings. Interventions targeting sibling QOL and the rigorous examination of these interventions are lacking. Our objective was to assess the efficacy of a manualized group intervention (EG), Siblings Coping Together (SCT), on siblings' quality of life compared to an Attention Control Group (CG), and to identify factors related to the intervention effect. Design/Methods: We conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with two arms: EG and CG. 75 healthy siblings (average age 11 years, range 718) of children with cancer who were >3 months from diagnosis participated. EG followed SCT's educational, social, and therapeutic problemsolving plan through games and crafts; CG consisted of games and crafts only. Self and proxy reported Pediatric Quality of Life Questionnaires (PedsQL) were completed at baseline, end of intervention, and 3 months later. Total and subscales scores were generated. Multivariable analyses with a mixed effects model were used to examine the intervention effect over time, controlling for covariates (e.g., gender). Results: Improvements in PedsQL proxy scores (total and subscales) were noted over time in both groups (p < 0.001, h2 =0.134 and h2 =0.133. respectively). Siblings in the EG reported significantly better school PedsQL scores overall than siblings in the CG (M = 79.51 vs 73.74; p < 0.03, effect size=5.76). A significant group by gender interaction in the proxy school PedsQL scores indicated that compared to the EG, girls in the CG were rated with worse scores (p < 0.003, h2 =0.126). Conclusions: Participating in groups with other siblings of children with cancer can result in improved overall QOL. However, participating in specific group intervention to address siblings' needs can improve school QOL, particularly in females. Challenges to this research need to be addressed. This research was funded by Canadian C17 Network. O-101 Development and Validation of Age Stratified Paediatric Oncology Distress Thermometer L. Edwards 1 1The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, Paediatric Psychological Support, Sutton, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: The aim of this project is to complete the development and validation of a brief psychosocial and memory distress thermometer (DT) to be used with paediatric/young adult cancer patients Design/Methods: Prepilot/Development of the tool Ageappropriate versions of the screening tool were developed: under five, 57, 812, 1317 and 18plus . along with an accompanying parent proxy version. Pilot A pilot study was carried out with 45 patients and their parents to test acceptability and usability of the tool. Amendments were made to the tools according to the feedback. Validation The cross sectional questionnaire project was conducted in 7 collaborating paediatric oncology centres with 549 participants ( child patient and parent proxy) to validate the DT against the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS) for psychological distress, Health Utilities Index (HUI2) for memory and learning validation and Paediatric quality of life scale (Pedsql) Results: Using a cutoff of 4, sensitivity against SDQ for all age groups under 18 was 75.8 (range 65.7-84.2), 18plus against HADS was 75.8 (65.7-84.2). The specificity was 53.3 (range 47.8-58.7) against the SDQ for the 18 plus specificity against the HADS was 47.1 (34.8-59.6). The sensitivity against the HUI2 for all age groups was 89.0 (79.5-95.1), sensitivity was 70.3 (65.9-74.4). Conclusions: The DT is valid and acceptable for use as a rapid screening instrument for paediatric cancer patients in the UK. The results indicate that it can be used to monitor change in psychological distress and memory problems over time, but we recommend further work to determine how and when to use the tool clinically. The screening tool research project was approved by the Royal Marsden Research and Development committee and Surrey Borders Ethics Committee (MREC). Free Paper Session: PPO II O-102 Establishing a Paediatric Oncofertility Program: Uptake of Procedures and Acceptance of Fertility Decisions in Families at A Tertiary Centre Y. Jayasinghe 1, M. Kemertzis1, L. Orme2, M. Zacharin3, Hospital, Endocrinology, Australia; 8Royal IVF, Clinical Research, Melbourne, Australia; 11Royal Children's Hospital, Clinical Ethics Service, Melbourne, Australia Background/Objectives: There is little published data regarding fertility preservation in the paediatric population, including data on families feelings of regret or acceptance of their fertility decision. We aim to describe uptake of fertility preservation procedures at The Royal Childrens Hospital Melbourne since 1987, and their impact on decision regret in families. Design/Methods: Bidirectional cohort study. In August 2013, we introduced a formalised oncofertility service under three levels of governance (as a novel technology, with research and clinical ethics governance). Oncofertility data was recorded in a fertility preservation database. Families completed a validated decision regret scale regarding the fertility decision with scores 30 representing high regret. Results: Three hundred and ten patients underwent fertility preservation procedures at a mean age of 13.9 years (range 0.123 years), 55% were male, 32% prepubertal. Most procedures (65%) occurred between 20132016. These included ovarian tissue preservation [28% (n=88)] with follicle density of 0.3134/mm2, (where 4 patients had mature oocytes within the tissue); testicular tissue preservation [28% (n=88)] (where 8 had Invasive procedures were done for moderate to high risk of infertility. Minor complications occurred in 3%, with no delays to cancer treatment. One hundred and thirty eight participants (108 parents, 30 patients) completed a decisional regret survey. Most (82.5%) reported low regret (mean score 13.7, SD 18.8; range 095). Having a fertility preservation procedure was an independent predictor of low regret on (p<0.0001, OR=0.11, CI= 0.03 0.37). Expectation of a positive fertility outcome within the next generation was high. Conclusions: Paediatric fertility preservation procedures are safe, and associated with low regret in families. Demand is steadily increasing. It is important to provide accurate and transparent and realistic information support to families prior to diagnosis and throughout survivorship. O-103 GeneticsRelated Beliefs, and Information and Service Needs, of Childhood Cancer Survivors and Their Parents C. Wakefield 1,2, E. Doolan1,2, C. Signorelli1,2, K. 1University of Women's and Children's Health, Sydney, Australia; 2Kids Cancer Centre, Sydney Children's Hospital, Sydney, Australia; 3Prince of Wales Hospital, Hereditary Cancer Clinic, Sydney, Australia; 4DanaFarber Cancer Institute, Department of Psychosocial Oncology and Palliative Care, Boston, USA Background/Objectives: Despite increasing recognition of the potential role of genetics risk assessment in childhood cancer survivorship, the geneticsrelated needs of survivors and their families are understudied. This mixedmethods study assessed survivors' and parents' beliefs about what caused the cancer (causal attributions), their geneticsrelated service use, future service needs and their unmet geneticsrelated information needs. Design/Methods: 596 participants (384 survivors; 211 parents of survivors) completed questionnaires and optional interviews. We used multiple logistic regression to determine clinical/demographic associations with perceived importance of access to a geneticist and with unmet information needs. Results: 36/49 survivors offered cancerrelated genetic testing chose to undergo testing. Of those not offered genetic testing (n=547, 92% of total sample), 16% of survivors and parents endorsed genetics ('it runs in the family') as a cause of the cancer. Most participants (survivors=80%, parents=82%) indicated it was 'important'/'very important' to receive geneticsrelated information in survivorship care, and 28% of survivors and 35% of parents indicated that it was important to have access to a genetics specialist. 47% of survivors and 51% of parents indicated they had an unmet need for genetic information related to their cancer. In survivors, greater fear of cancer recurrence (p=.03) and longer time since diagnosis (p=.01) was associated with greater likelihood of indicating access to a genetic counsellor/geneticist was important. Participants who believed the cancer was genetic and those with greater fear of recurrence were more likely to have unmet geneticsrelated information needs (p.03). Survivors satisfied with their followup care were less likely to indicate they had unmet geneticsrelated information needs than those who were unsatisfied (p.04). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that survivors and their parents have needs for geneticsrelated services and information, which are largely unmet. Meeting such needs using innovative models of care may improve satisfaction with survivorship care. O-104 Impact of Chronic Pulmonary Deficits and Cardiac Abnormalities on Neurocognitive Function in LongTerm Survivors of Childhood Hodgkin and Cancer Control, Memphis, USA; 2St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Diagnostic Imaging, Memphis, Children's Research Hospital, Oncology, Memphis, Jude Children's Research Hospital, Biostatistics, Memphis, USA Background/Objectives: To compare neurocognitive function in longterm survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) to community controls and examine associations with pulmonary deficits and cardiac abnormalities. Design/Methods: 158 HL survivors treated with thoracic radiation (mean[SD] age 37.7[7.8] years, 23.4[8.1] years postdiagnosis) and completed neuropsychological testing. Ageadjusted Zscores (=0, =1.0) were compared between groups. Systematic grading of pulmonary deficits (obstructive, restrictive, diffusion deficits) and cardiac abnormalities (structural, functional defects, arrhythmias) was conducted and analyzed as predictors of neurocognitive function using generalized linear modeling, adjusting for age. Analyses were stratified to examine the effect of smoking on neurocognitive function in survivors with/without morbidity. Results: Survivors performed poorer than controls on short Zscores: speed (0.14[1.0] v 0.39[1.0]; P=0.05). Moderate to disabling pulmonary deficits (32%) and cardiac abnormalities (22%) were present in survivors. Survivors with pulmonary deficits performed worse than survivors without any morbidity, on sustained attention (1.47[3.5] v 0.09[2.2]; P=0.009), visual processing speed (0.28[1.0] processing speed (0.23[0.8] v 0.30[1.0]; P=0.005). Cardiac abnormalities were not associated with neurocognitive function. In survivors without pulmonary deficits, current smokers were more impaired than noncurrent smokers (P's<0.05) but in survivors with pulmonary deficits, smoking did not contribute to worse performance. Conclusions: Roughly 20 years posttreatment, survivors of HL have worse neurocognitive outcomes than controls. Pulmonary deficits and smoking were associated with worse outcomes. Future work should evaluate the impact of pulmonary insufficiency on neurocognitive outcomes. HL survivors should be educated on the neurocognitive effects of smoking. O-105 The use of Murine Models of Chemosensitivity to Anticancer Agents in Childhood Cancer Clinical Care: Survivor, Parent and Community Acceptability and WillingnesstoPay C. Wakefield 1,2, V. Quinn1,2, E. Doolan1,2, 1University of Women's and Children's Health, Sydney, Australia; 2Kids Cancer Centre, Sydney Children's Hospital, Sydney, Australia; 3Prince of Wales Hospital, Department of Medical Oncology, Sydney, Australia; 4DanaFarber Cancer Institute, Department of Psychosocial Palliative Care, Boston, USA; 5Children's Cancer Institute, Research Centre, Sydney, Australia Using patientderived xenografts (PDXs) to assess chemosensitivity to anticancer agents in realtime may improve child cancer care, potentially enabling individualized clinical decisionmaking. However, it is unknown whether this application of a new methodology to clinical practice will meet with wider community acceptance. Our twostage study with 491 participants investigated the acceptability of PDXs in those affected by childhood cancer and the community. Design/Methods: Stage 1 identified the most commonly perceived advantages/disadvantages of PDXs in 24 individuals affected by childhood cancer (16 survivors, 8 parents). In Stage 2, we interviewed 68 individuals (26 survivors, 42 parents of survivors), and surveyed 399 matched community members (213 young adults, 186 parents) on the issues highlighted in Stage 1. We computed regressions to identify factors influencing willingnesstouse, willingnesstopay, acceptable waittimes for results, and acceptable number of mice used. Results: PDXs were highly acceptable: 90% of those affected by cancer leaned toward using PDXs (community participants: 65%). Survivors and survivors' parents were more willing to use PDXs [t(465)=2.39, p=.02], and were willing to pay more [t(65.47)=5.49, p<.001], wait longer [t(69.61)=2.94, p=.004], and sacrifice more mice (t(31.90), p=.003) than community participants. Willingnesstouse remained high in survivors/survivors' parents after considering PDX disadvantages [t(66)=0.15, p=.88]. Community participants had higher willingnesstouse, would pay more, and use more mice when considering their child rather than themselves. Better understanding predicted higher willingnesstouse, and increased willingnesstowait. Harm to animals was the least endorsed disadvantage. Conclusions: Although clinical efficacy of PDXs is not yet established, consent rates will likely be high when PDXs are used in clinical practice, especially when the patient is a child. Willingnesstopay and maximum acceptable number of mice aligned well with planned usage, although maximum acceptable waittimes were lower than is likely to be clinically achievable. O-106 Social Outcomes among Adolescent LongTerm Survivors of Wilms Tumor: A Report from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study R. Foster 1,2, R. Hayashi2, M. Wang3, W. K. Krull5, K. Hardy8,9 1St. Louis Children's Hospital, Department of Psychology, St. Louis MO, USA; 2Washington University School of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, St. Louis MO, USA; 3St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Department of Biostatistics, Memphis TN, USA; 4University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Department of Radiation Physics, Houston TX, USA; 5St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, Memphis TN, USA; 6Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Departments of Pediatrics and Internal Medicine, New York NY, USA; 7Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Clinical Research Division, Seattle WA, USA; 8Children's National Health System, Neuropsychology Division, Washington DC, USA; 9George Washington University School of Medicine, Departments of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences and Pediatrics, Washington DC, USA Background/Objectives: The study aims were to identify social problems among adolescent longterm survivors of Wilms tumor (WT) and determine whether treatment exposures, chronic health conditions, or psychological concerns relate to peer interaction frequency and quality. Design/Methods: Parentreports from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) were analyzed for 666 survivors of WT diagnosed between 19701999 (Median[range] age at diagnosis=2.59[0.0111.18] years; diagnosis=12.56[5.6217.44] years; age at survey=15.42[12.0017.97] years) and 698 siblings of survivors from the overall CCSS cohort (15.49[12.0118.00] years). Survivors were compared to siblings on frequency and quality of parentreported peer interactions on the Behavior Problem Inventory (BPI) adjusting for race and household income. Survivors' treatment exposures, chronic medical conditions (CTCAE v4.03), and psychological outcomes from the BPI were examined via multinomial logistic regression adjusting for sex, race, household income, and age at diagnosis to calculate adjusted Relative Risk (aRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: Compared to siblings, fewer survivors were reported to have zero or one friend (10.10% vs. 7.21%, p=0.04); however, survivors were rated as having greater difficulties getting along with friends (p<0.0001). Survivors with anxiety/depression (aRR=5.27, 95% CI 1.566.91), or social withdrawal (aRR=8.35, CI 3.9117.85) had fewer friends compared to survivors without these problems. Survivors with antisocial behavior (aRR=0.31, CI 0.140.67), anxiety/depression (aRR=0.41, CI 0.250.80), or social withdrawal (aRR=0.12, CI 0.050.30) were described as having greater difficulty getting along with friends compared to survivors without problems. Treatment exposures (e.g., chemotherapy, radiation) and endocrine and cardiovascular problems did not impact number of friends, time spent with friends, or ability to get along with friends. Conclusions: Despite multiple friendships, relationship quality for adolescent survivors of WT appears worse than for siblings. Adolescent survivors require support to develop socialization skills enhancing relationship quality. O-107 Sleep Problems After Induction Therapy in Children with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia and their Association with Quality of Life and Fatigue L.M.H. Steur 1, M.A. Grootenhuis2,3, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; 2Princess M\u00e1xima Center for pediatric oncology, The Netherlands; 3Emma Children's Hospital Academic Medical department, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; 4Sophia Children's Hospital Erasmus Medical Department Rotterdam, The Netherlands; 5Amalia Children's Hospital Radboud University oncology, Nijmegen, The Netherlands; 6Emma Children's Hospital Academic Medical of pediatric oncology, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; 7Beatrix Children's Hospital University Medical oncology, Groningen, The Netherlands; 8Dutch Childhood Oncology Group, The Hague, The Netherlands Background/Objectives: Sleep may be a predictor of quality of life (QoL) and fatigue in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). This study aims to investigate the extent of sleep problems and their relation to QoL and fatigue in children during treatment for ALL. Design/Methods: Patients aged 218 years, treated according to the Dutch Childhood Oncology Group ALL11 treatment protocol, were included (expected final sample size n=105). Sleep, QoL and fatigue were assessed shortly after end of induction treatment with parentproxy questionnaires (Children Sleep Habits Questionnaire and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Generic and Multidimensional Fatigue Scale). Additionally, sleep was objectively measured using actigraphy. Zscores were calculated for total sleep questionnaire scores using healthy norms. Scores exceeding Zscores of 1 and 2 reflected clinically relevance. Actigraphy outcomes (sleep duration, sleep efficiency and wake after sleep onset (WASO)) were compared to norms. Regression models were constructed for the associations between sleep and QoL and fatigue. Results: Nintynine children (mean age 6.9\u00b14.5 years, 40.8% girls) were included (response rate 66%). Questionnaires were assessed in 98 children and actigraphy data were available in 56 children. Clinically relevant sleep problems were found in 36.8% (Zscore>1) and 14.9% (Zscore>2) of the patients, compared to 15.9% and 2.3% in healthy norms, respectively. Patients had a longer sleep duration (508.3 versus 412.1 minutes (p<0.001)), a lower sleep efficiency and WASO (134.4 versus 87.0 minutes (p<0.001)). Adjusted for preexisting sleep problems and gender, sleep problems were significantly associated with lower physical (B:7.25(95%CI:11.19;3.30)) and psychosocial QoL (B:3.98(95%CI:7.31;0.66)) and and cognitive fatigue (B:4.55(95%CI:7.90;1.20)). Conclusions: Clinically relevant sleep problems are common during treatment for ALL and were negatively associated with QoL and fatigue. Intervention studies aiming to improve sleep are needed to improve QoL and fatigue in children with ALL. Acknowledgements: Grant sponsor: Dutch Cancer Society. Free Paper Session: Podc Supportive Care O-108 SofosbuvirBased Therapy for Chronic Hepatitis C Infection in Children with Malignancies S. Jayabose1, A. Palaniappan1, N. Iyer1, K. Viswanathan 1, A. Annamalai1 1Meenakshi Mission Hospital & Research Center, Pediatric HematologyOncology, Madurai, India Background/Objectives: In adults with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, their outcomes have dramatically improved with directly acting antiviral agents (DAA) like sofosbuvir. But there are no data or guidelines on the use of DAA in children under 12 years of age. The objective of our study is to analyze the efficacy and safety of sofosbuvirbased therapy in children with malignancies and genoype1 plus ribavirin. Design/Methods: Our cohort includes 13 children with cancer and genotype 1 HCV infection who had failed standard treatment with pegIFNa2b plus ribavirin (twelve of them off all chemotherapy) treated in 2015. All patients received triple drug combination: fixed dose sofosbuvir400 mg P.O. once daily; weekly inj; and ribavirin mg/kg/day in 2 doses, for 12 weeks. HCV titers were followed at 12 and 24 weeks from start of treatment. Results: Thirteen children with chronic HCV infection, all with genotype 1, were treated: Male,6; female, 7; median age, 9.5 years (range 7 to 21). Underlying malignancies were B ALL, 9; TALL, 1; Burkitt Lymphoma, 1; AML,1; Hodgkin Lymphoma, 1.. Viral load at diagnosis ranged from 0.1 to 10 million IU/ml. Sustained virologic response ([SVR] defined as negative HCV RNA at 12 weeks after completion of treatment) was achieved in 10 of 11 patients evaluable for SVR; one patient died within 3 months due to progressive malignancy; and one was lost to followup after 12 weeks. Median followup: 14 months (range, 321). One patient had oral aphthous ulcers, requiring interruption of pegInterferon alone for 2 weeks. No patient had grade 3 or 4 neutropenia or significant elevation of AST and ALT on therapy. Conclusions: Sofosbuvir containing triple drug therapy is an effective and safe treatment for genotype1 HCV infection in children with malignancies. O-109 Infectious Complications HIVInfected and HIVUninfected Children Treated BCell NonHodgkins Lymphomas Rowe1, 1University the Witwatersrand and Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital, Paediatrics, Johannesburg, South Africa; 2Medical Research Council, Meningeal and Respiratory Pathogens Research Unit University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa; 3Medical Research Council Department of Science/ National Research Foundation: Vaccine Preventable Diseases Faculty of Health Science National Institute for Communicable Diseases a Division of National Health Laboratory Service Sandringham, Meningeal and Respiratory Pathogens Research Unit University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa Background/Objectives: INTRODUCTION: Treatment of cancer in HIVinfected children is challenging as therapy compromises an already immunesuppressed state. AIM OF THE STUDY: To establish the infectious complications in HIVinfected and HIVuninfected children treated for NHL with the BFMNHL protocol. Design/Methods: METHOD: Hospital records for children with NHL (2000 to 2009) were reviewed. Age, HIV status (CD4+ count and HIV viral load if HIVinfected), cancer stage, sex and anthropometry were recorded. The temperature, duration of fever, white cell count, neutrophil, lymphocyte and monocyte counts, blood culture and clinical syndromes were recorded for each septic episode. Results: 58 children had NHL (51.7% HIVinfected, 80.7% males, and median age 89.5 months). The microbiologicallyconfirmed septic episodes (100 child years) among HIVinfected children was 122.5 and for HIVuninfected children was 48.2 (p<0.001). The incidence Grampositive bacteraemia tuberculosis (25 vs. p<0.001), and invasive fungal infections (28 vs 7; p=0.001) in the HIVinfected compared with the HIVuninfected cohort. The mean maximum temperature was higher in the HIVinfected (p=0.022). HIVinfected children had a longer duration of and lymphopenia (p<0.001) than HIVuninfected children. Ten (33.3%) the HIVinfected cohort died because of sepsis (p=0.0006), 60% had Stage 4 disease, 80% had a CD4+ < 15%, and 70% had a HIVviral load > 200 000 RNA copies/ml. Multiple pathogens were isolated from children who died including multidrug resistant bacteria, and 90% had pneumonia. Conclusions: ARVs have reduced the mortality and morbidity of HIVinfected patients; but lymphomas remain a major issue. The use of chemotherapy in HIVinfected patients results in further immunedepletion and an increased rate of infections. As children with HIV survive longer due to better antiretroviral and supportive therapies, HIVrelated malignancies may become an increasingly common problem. O-110 Clinical Impact of Isolating Respiratory Viruses in Children with Febrile Neutropenia P. Jain 1, and BMT unit, Delhi, India Background/Objectives: Febrile respiratory illness (FRI) is common in immunocompromised children receiving treatment for malignancy. Data on viral respiratory pathogens as a cause of febrile neutropenia is limited. Etiologic significance of respiratory virus detection, its impact on hospital stay and antibiotic use was evaluated. Design/Methods: Immunocompromised children (18years of age) receiving treatment at a pediatric oncology unit, presenting with FRI, were prospectively analysed from September2015-February2017. Children were evaluated clinically and respiratory secretions were obtained for detection of 16 viruses and 6 bacteria by realtime polymerase chain reaction. Results: A total of 85 episodes were evaluated from 53 eligible children out of 182 being treated. Male:female ratio was 2.2:1, median age 3.16 years. Cough (92.9%) was the most common respiratory symptom associated with tachypnoea in 32.9%. Atleast one respiratory pathogen was identified in 70 (82.3%) samples and 17 (20%) of them tested positive for dual respiratory pathogens. Rhinovirus(24.4%) was the most common isolate followed by was present in 61.6% of the total FRI episodes. Viral respiratory pathogen was the only identifiable etiology of febrile neutropenic episode in 47.3%. Culture positive sepsis (20.7%) or other underlying cause was detected in 11.3% while cause of FN could not be identified in 20.7%. Duration of hospitalisation was significantly shorter in those with solely respiratory pathogen as an etiology for FN compared to those with sepsis (P<0.001). These children could be managed with lesser number of antibiotics compared to those where no cause of FN was established (P=0.02) and had no mortality compared to children with coexistent sepsis (33.3%) or other underlying cause (13.3%). Conclusions: Respiratory viruses are common in FRI during febrile neutropenia. Isolation of respiratory virus can minimize antibiotics use and hospital stay. O-111 Is it Safe to Administer HighDose Methotrexate (HDMTX) without Monitoring Mtx Levels? Experience with 100 K. Vaishnavi1, D. Bansal 1, A. Trehan1, R. Jain1, S. Attri2 1Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Pediatric HematologyOncology unit Dept. of Pediatrics Advanced Pediatrics Centre, Chandigarh, India; 2Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Biochemistry Dept. of Pediatrics Advanced Pediatrics Centre, Chandigarh, India Background/Objectives: Access to MTXlevels is often lacking in developing countries. To evaluate if HDMTX can be administered safely with extended hydration/leucovorin rescue, with monitoring of serumcreatinine and urinarypH. Design/Methods: In the prospective study, 3 and 5 gm/m2 of MTX (24hour infusion) was administered to patients with B and Tcell ALL/NHL, respectively. Six doses of leucovorin (15 mg/m2/dose), instead of recommended 3 (if the levels were to be optimally reduced) at the standard timing (42hours from start of HDMTX) were administered. Hydration was continued for 72hours, instead of recommended 30hours. If serum creatinine exceeded 1.25 times the baseline, the volume of hydration was increased. UrinarypH was measured at three time points. The study was approved by institution's ethics committee (NK/1938/MD/269293). Informed consent was obtained. Results: Study included 100cycles 28, 18 3. The mean age was 6.8\u00b13.2 years (range: 113). Patients were underweight in 15 (15%) cycles. Patients in 23 (23%) cycles had a rise in creatinine to >1.25 times the baseline. Augmentation of alkalinization was not indicated, as urinarypH was optimal in respectively Grade 1/2/3/4 in was observed in 26/16/1/0 at coadministration of voriconazole (p=0.005). A single mortality was observed from seasonal, dengueshocksyndrome. Conclusions: Administration of HDMTX without measuring MTXlevels, with extended hydration, additional doses of leucovorin and monitoring of serum creatinine is feasible with manageable toxicities. The study could be replicated in additional centers for generating evidence, for suggesting guidelines for administration of HDMTX in numerous centers in developing countries that lack access to MTXlevels O-112 Degree of Organ Dysfunction is the Major Risk Factor for Mortality in Pediatric Cancer Patients Admitted to Pediatric Intensive Care Unit H. Abdel Rahman Sayed 1, S. Abdel Hamid2, H. El Gebaly3, S. Hassan4, N. Hassan5 1National Cairo University Egypt, Pediatric Oncology, Guizah, Egypt; 2National Cancer Institute Cairo University Egypt, Cairo, Egypt; 3Cairo University, Pediatric, Cairo, Egypt; 4Nasser Egypt; 5National Cancer Institute Cairo UIniversity, Medical biostatisics, Cairo, Egypt Background/Objectives: Improvement of survival in pediatric cancers has been linked to more aggressive treatment regimens, increasing lifethreatening complications that may require Pediatric Intensive Care Units (PICU) admission. Nearly 40% of pediatric cancer patients may require intensive care services, accounting for approximately 3% of all PICU admissions.The aim of the current study was to evaluate predictors of outcome among pediatric cancer patients treated at the PICU, National Cancer Institute (NCI), Cairo University, and its corelation to patient's risk factors. Design/Methods: A retrospective study including 217 patients, for whom 267 PICU admissions was recorded during the period between July 2013 to June 2014. Data analysis included patients' demographics. Patients were assessed according to Pediatric Risk of Mortality III (PRISM), as well as Pediatric Organ Logistic Dysfunction (PELOD) on their 1st day of PICU admission. Moreover, survival was correlated to other risk factors including age, diagnosis, disease status, sepsis, the use of mechanical ventilation, and need for inotropes. Results: Patients age ranged from 6 months to 18 years (median 6 years), with evident male predominance. Sixty percent of the patients had hematological malignancies. Average length of stay was 8 days [SD\u00b1 6.6], ranging from 1 to 38 days. Risk factors associated with worse outcome included high PRISM and PLEOD score; pvalue 0.003, and <0.001 respectively. Survival outcome was worse in patients who were mechanically ventilated, and/or on inotropic support, with a pvalue of <0.001. Conclusions: high PRISM III as well as PELOD scoring rather than type of malignancy and disease status is the main predictor of outcome in PICU among pediatric cancer patients. Early recognition of signs of organ failure, and referral to PICU may shorten the ICU length of stay with its morbid complication that can worsen the outcome. O-113 Early Deaths in Pediatric Acute Leukemia; A Major Challenge in Developing Countries H. Hafez 1,2, R. Soliaman1, D. Bilal3, L. Shalaby1,2 Cairo University, hematology/oncology, Egypt; Hospital Egypt CCHE 57357, Cairo, 3National Cancer Institute Cairo University, Biostatistics, Cairo, Egypt Background/Objectives: Despite a steady improvement in supportive care over the last 30 years, treatment related toxicity remains a major challenge in childhood acute leukemia therapy, especially in middle income countries. The aim of the study is to describe the incidence and risk factors associated with early deaths (first 42 days of treatment) among children with acute leukemia Design/Methods: This is a retrospective study included newly diagnosed patients with acute leukemia who presented to the National Cancer Institute, Cairo University between Jan. 2011 to Dec. 2013. Patients' data were collected and analyzed for the total and early death rates and proposed causes of death. Results: The study included 370 patients, 253 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 100 with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 17 with mixed phenotypic acute leukemia. The total death rate among the whole group was 40.5% (n=150) and induction death rate was 19.2% (n=71). Patients with AML had higher total and induction death rates as they were 58% and 25% respectively, compared to 33.6% and 17.4% in ALL. Most of the early deaths were attributed to infection 64.7% and cerebrovascular accidents 18.3%. Early deaths were significantly higher in patients below 2 years old (p. = 0.008), and in those with poor response to therapy (p. = 0.001). Using enhanced supportive care measures with available intensive care unit during 2013 had significantly reduced the overall and induction mortality rates (27.8% and 13.8% respectively in 2013 versus 45% and 20.3% in 2011 and 49% and 25% in 2012) Conclusions: Induction deaths in pediatric acute leukemia remain a major challenge in developing countries and constitute an increasing fraction of all deaths. Accordingly, using well equipped centers with better supportive care guidelines is essential to improve the survival in this group of patients Free Paper Session: Epidemiology II O-114 Pilot Study Identifies CSF Metabolomic Biomarkers for Symptoms of Cognitive Impairment during Treatment for Pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia - Oncology, Houston TX, USA; 2Baylor College of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics - Psychology, Houston TX, USA; 3University of Arizona, College of Nursing, Tucson AZ, 4Duke University, School of Nursing, Durham NC, USA; 5University of Minnesota, School of Nursing, Minneapolis MN, USA Background/Objectives: While survival rates for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pALL) exceed 90%, many patients experience treatmentrelated cognitive impairment. Because prognostic markers of cognitive impairment are lacking, the purpose of this pilot study was to identify cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for symptoms of cognitive impairment during pALL chemotherapy. Design/Methods: CSF samples were collected at 5months postinduction on 96 liquid chromatography (LC)/MS/MS. Caregiverperceived cognitive function was evaluated during the first month of treatment and 12months postinduction using a 13item scale (pedsFACITPCF). MannWhitney U test and logistic regression were used to compare metabolite values between: 1) cases whose ratings declined from the normal range (Tscore50) during the first month of treatment to the mildmoderate difficulty range (Tscore<50), and 2) controls with ratings in the normal range at 12months postinduction. A false discovery rate (FDR) pvalue accounted for multiple comparisons. Results: In this cohort diagnosed 20122014, 24% of patients displayed symptoms of mildmoderate cognitive impairment at 12months postinduction. Significant alterations (FDR<0.05) were observed in associations remained after adjusting for age, sex, race, and treatment intensity. Notably, four of the six metabolites identified by this study are involved in dopamine neurotransmitter metabolism. Compared to patient and treatment factors alone (area under curve [AUC]=0.71), CSF biomarkers significantly (p=0.01) improved the ability to distinguish patients with symptoms of cognitive impairment from those with normal cognitive function (AUC=0.89 for 5hydroxyindoleacetate and tyrosine). Conclusions: We identified novel CSF biomarkers for caregiverperceived symptoms of treatmentrelated cognitive impairment among patients treated for pALL. These findings may translate to clinical improvements in the management of cognitive outcomes by introducing the opportunity to deliver targeted interventions to highrisk patients prior to irreversible cognitive impairment. O-115 TED: A French National Registry for Childhood Cancers and Congenital Abnormalities Associations C. Fouquet 1, M. Semeraro2, F. Bourdeaut3, Cave4, France Background/Objectives: Most of the cancers arising in early childhood result from the embryonic layers and represent, unlike the adults tumors, developmental and implementation accidents of various tissues more than accidents bound to ageing or tissue turnover. Design/Methods: Launched in June 2013, the TED (Tumeur Et Developpement) study is a national, prospective and retrospective registration of cases combining a paediatric cancer and congenital abnormalities. A data extraction has been performed and the clinical characteristics of these patients are here depicted. Results: From 2013 to March 2017, 628 patients have been enrolled in the TED database by 27 French medical centres. The number of cases was slightly higher for boys (sex ratio 1.12) and the most frequent tumors were leukaemias (17%), brain tumors (16%) and nephroblastomas (15%), which were different from that that described by the National Registry of Childhood Cancers. Data concerning both developmental abnormalities and tumors were available for 532 patients. Among them, about 177 predisposition syndromes (33%) have been recorded. Despite the evidence of the already known associations, (type 1 neurofibromatosis and optic glioma, BeckwithWiedemann syndrome and nephroblastoma, Down syndrome and leukaemia, gonosome abnormalities and malignant germinal tumors), new interesting associations were found highlighting common embryonic origin (ie neuroblastoma and depigmentation phenotype), somatic mosaicisms (ie bladder rhabdomyosarcoma and hypospadias) and early cancer diagnoses compared to median age of paediatric cancer occurrence (4.3 vs 5 years old). Only 44.5 % of the patients recorded in the database benefited from a genetic counselling. Conclusions: TED is one of the most important and exhaustive study reporting associations of birth defects with paediatric cancers. It represents a key collection for describing new mechanisms and genetic pathways involved in tumorigenesis and malformations. Further efforts are actually deployed to better identify the clinical and genetic clusters. O-116 Narrowing Childhood Cancer Survival GAP in Brazil: Analisys of 6126 Patients by A Hospital Based Cancer Registry in 25 Years' History of a Single Institution M. Cypriano 1, Paulo, Brazil Background/Objectives: Approximately 80% of children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer live in countries with limited resources were the chances of cure are much lower than the 80% reported in developed countries. Data from 2004 S\u00e3o PauloBrazil populationbased cancer registry revealed a 5years survival (OS) rate of only 41% for children 014 years of age. Objective: to evaluate the characteristics and 5 years OS of pediatric patients in a single institution. Design/Methods: In 2010, we established an institutional cancer registry that is fully organized and mature enough to provide reliable data of our patient population. The data for survival estimates were extracted from patients' charts and by active search of public records. We excluded from the survival analysis patients who received only one treatment modality and then returned to the service of origin. Results: Of 6126 patients registered from 1991 to 2015, 56% were boys. Age distribution at diagnosis was as follows: 09 years of age 58%, 1019 years old 37%, over 19 years 5%. The most common cancer type was brain tumors (18%), leukemia (17%) and bone tumors (13%). There was a noticeable shift in the patients' profile reflecting institutional growth: in the first decade, malignancies amenable to outpatient treatment were more common, whereas in the second decade we registered a marked increase of high complexity cases such as brain tumors. The 5years OS for patients < 19yrs was 71%. Survival has reached international standards for tumor (87%) and Blineage ALL (80%). Conclusions: The organization of a registry allowed us to study the epidemiological profile of our patients and document that our institutional OS is superior to the state of Sao Paulo. This led us to conclude that an organized, dedicated oncology center is able to narrow the survival gap between Brazilian patients and their counterpart in the developed world. O-117 Incidence and Determinants of Lost Diagnostic Opportunities for Children with Cancer in Argentina E. Grynszpancholc1, V. Pinto 1, A. Ayoroa1, Disparities in accessing to accurate and timely childhood cancer diagnosis are usual in developing countries. Failed or delayed diagnoses are major causes of poor survival and quality of life. The Natali Dafne Flexer Foundation (FNDF) provides integral assistance to families facing pediatric cancer in Argentina. This study contains preliminary data from an ongoing study aimed to analyze the incidence and modulators of lost diagnostic opportunities (LDO) in those families assisted by the FNDF along a fiveyear period. Design/Methods: Retrospective qualiquantitative analysis. Families with 020 y/o children who got cancer diagnoses between 2011 and 2015 were included. Demographic, disease and health insurance data, and medical institutions involved in the diagnoses process, were compared between groups with or without LDO. Additional data were extracted from parent`s narration. Results: A total of 572 families whose diagnostic trajectory was exhaustively registered were included. 56% of them reported to have one (36%), two (14%), three (3%) or more than three (3%) LDO. 91.5% were Argentinian, being the sample fairly representative of the distribution of childhood cancer in the Country regarding age, province of residence, sex and type of cancer. 30% had social/private health insurance and 69%, Public Health coverage. Retinoblastoma and low age positively correlated with absence of LDO (p<0.01). The Southern and Northern Regions, with vast provinces of low socioeconomic index and low population density, exhibited higher proportion of LDO than the mean for the Country. The type of institution (public/private) was independent of the presence of LDO, while consultations to private centers became more frequent as the number of LDO increased (p<0.05). Conclusions: A substantial number of families experience problems for obtaining childhood cancer diagnosis in Argentina. Disease and demographic determinants may influence the possibility of having LDO. Addressing such problems will help developing evidencedriven, specific and local interventions to improve diagnoses process. O-118 Improving Early Referral and Diagnosis of Brain Tumours in Children Impact of National \"lHeadSmart\" Campaign in west of Scotland J. Sastry 1, A. Hafez1 1Royal Hospital for Children, Haematology and Oncology, Glasgow, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: A nationwide campaign, \"HeadSmart: Be Brain Tumour Aware\", was launched in 2011 in response to a national survey carried out in 2006 which indicated that referral practice in the UK for paediatric brain tumours ranked poorly in international comparisons. The aim of the campaign was to raise public and professional awareness in order to reduce the total diagnostic interval (TDI) from a precampaign median of 14 (mean 35.4) weeks to less than 5 weeks so as to match the shortest published TDI. The audit was carried to evaluate the effectiveness of the campaign 5 years later and, in addition, to compare how local (Glasgow) referral practice aligns with national data. Design/Methods: Data was gathered from 19 patients under the age of 16 diagnosed with CNS tumours in Glasgow between May 2014 and March 2015. Data collection was performed by analysis of online patient records accessed through the NHSGGC clinical portal. TDI was calculated using various patient notes including GP letters and inpatient hospital records. Results: Since the initial survey in 2006, there has been a considerable reduction in TDI to a median of 9 (mean 16.3) weeks in the patients in Glasgow investigated in this study. However, this is still higher than the national median of 6.7 (mean 21.3) weeks in 2013. The greatest observed improvement was in the time taken to diagnose patients after their first presentation to healthcare, for which the median reduced from 3.3 to 0.5 weeks between 2011 and Glasgow patients in 2014/2015. Conclusions: The increased public and professional awareness of brain tumours has led to a clear improvement in TDI nationwide since 2006. However, the data analysed in this study suggests that continued work and data collection is required in Glasgow to ensure that TDIs more closely resemble nationwide results. Acknowledgement: J Ferguson, Data manger O-119 Factors Influencing Diagnostic Delays of Pediatric Cancers in Botswana Cancer and Hematology Centers, Medicine, Pediatrics, Houston, USA; 4Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Centers, Childhood Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention Program, Houstan, USA Background/Objectives: In lowtomiddle income countries (LMICs), timely access to care is a major barrier in treatment of childhood cancer and may lead to patients presenting with more extensive disease. This study aims to elucidate factors influencing diagnostic and treatment delays within Botswana. Design/Methods: Utilizing the Botswana Pediatric Oncology Database (BPOD), this study retrospectively analyzed demographic and timeline data from pediatric oncology patients (ages 018) presenting to Princess Marina Hospital (PMH) between January 2008December 2015. Results: Median total diagnostic delay, defined as date of symptom onset to date of diagnosis, was 10.7 weeks (IQR=5.120.7) (N=69). Of these ten weeks, the time that it took patients to reach PMH following onset of symptoms accounted for the majority of the delay (med=9.6 weeks, IQR=4.119.7) (N=66). Once patients presented to the tertiary care facility, the median time from biopsy to pathology result was 3 weeks (IQR=1.14.3) (N=89). Presence of metastasis upon diagnosis was significantly correlated with longer total diagnostic delay (p=0.001). Age, sex, distance to a cancer center, HIV status, medical aid status, and cancer diagnosis did not have a significant effect on diagnostic delays. Conclusions: Pediatric cancer patients in Botswana experienced significant delays in presenting to PMH for treatment. The overall diagnostic delay was comparable to that found in reports from other LMICs. However, diagnostic delay was correlated with risk for having metastatic disease, a unique finding compared to existing literature. Further prospective research is necessary to fully understand factors influencing diagnostic and treatment delays and to develop strategies to address these factors. Free Paper Session: Leukemia and Lymphoma O-120 Safety and Feasibility of Administration of OEPA/COPDAC Chemotherapy and PETCT Based Strategy for Treating Hodgkin Lymphoma in a Developing Country D. Bansal 1, J. Ramamoorthy1, S. Mohapatra1, A. Trehan1, N. Kakkar5, A. Das5 1Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Pediatric HematologyOncology unit Dept. of Pediatrics Advanced Pediatrics Centre, Chandigarh, India; 2Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Nuclear Medicine, Chandigarh, India; 3Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Radiotherapy, Chandigarh, India; 4Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Cytology, Chandigarh, India; 5Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Histopathology, Chandigarh, India Background/Objectives: Protocols with reduced anthracycline/alkylatingagent/bleomycin are currently favoured for Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). ABVD is popular in developing countries for ease/convention. There is lack of data on administration of 'nonABVD' protocols from developing countries. Design/Methods: The study was retrospective. EuronetPHLC1 based protocol was administered in a center in India from January2010 to March2016. A PETCT was performed at diagnosis and following OEPA2. Two/four courses of COPDAC were administered in Treatment Groups (TG) 2/3, respectively. Radiotherapy was indicated for inadequate (Deauvillescore 4) PETresponse. Results: Onehundredandthirtyfive patients with HL were treated in the 6yearperiod; 101 fulfilled the study criteria. The meanage of 101 patients was 7.6\u00b12.4 years (range: 213); 39% were underweight. The median observation time was 39 months (17, 61.5). An inadequate PETresponse was observed in 30/97 (31%) patients. Radiotherapy was administered to 15/30 patients. There were 36 episodes of febrileneutropenia in 22 patients, resulting in 4 deaths. All 4 treatmentrelatedmortalities and 33/36 (92%) episodes of febrileneutropenia were observed following the firstcourse of OEPA. Other events included 9 relapses and 1 therapyrelated AML. The 5yearOS in TG 1, 2 and 3 was 96.8%, 100% and 91.1%, respectively. The 5yearEFS and OS were 86.1% and 96%, respectively. The outcome compared favorably to the 5yearEFS (77.7%) and OS (92.7%) of the centers earlier experience with ABVD/COPP in 206 patients. Relapse was associated with bulky disease (P=0.001) and SUVmax<7 (P=0.01). Episodes of febrileneutropenia had a trend of association with anemia (P=0.074) and involvement of 4 nodal regions (P=0.095). Conclusions: Chemotherapy with OEPA/COPDAC and PETCT based response permitted reduction of therapy with a 5yearEFS (86.1%) that compared favourably with the 5yearEFS (77.7%) of patients who received ABVD/COPP in the center in the past. Febrile neutropenia and resultant mortality (4%) was concerning, and occurred commonly following the firstcourse of OEPA. Supportivecare systems should be wellplaced for administration of OEPA in developing countries.

The aim of the study was to describe the pediatric population with advanced Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) in our country and their treatment outcome. Design/Methods: This is a retrospective single center study. Data analysis for children with advanced stage HL (IIB or IIIB with bulk disease, or stage IV) as done. Demographic data, staging, number of cycles (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine (ABVD)) received and whether or not consolidation radiotherapy (RTH) was administered. Positron emission tomography (PET) was performed baseline and after the second cycle to detect early response without any change to treatment plan. Results: Three hundred and eightyone patients with newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma were enrolled in the data analysis. Male (283) to female (98) ratio 3:1. Bsymptoms was present in 60% of patients. Ann Arbor staging distribution was as follows; 68 (17.8%) IIB, 97 (17.1%) IVB. One hundred sixtyfive patients with early unfavorable and 216 with advancedstage disease were treated with ABVD \u00b1 RTH. One hundred twenty nine (34%) patient did not receive RTH. The Fiveyears Overall survival (OS) and the Event free survival (EFS) in these patients was 90.7 (95% 0.006) respectively. The OS and EFS of patient with advanced stage HL in the whole study population was 94.1 (95% CI: 91.596.6) and 79.4 (95% CI 74.384.4) respectively. than 90% of patients are cured with riskbased combinedmodality therapy, yet these therapies are frequently associated with risks for significant long term toxicities; innovative approaches are needed for those patients who have a high risk of failure with current therapies. O-122 Diagnosis and Treatment of Anaplastic LargeCell Lymphoma in Children and Adolescents in China: A Retrospective Multicenter Survey Study Q. Mi 1, G. Yijin1, T. Jingyan1 1Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Hemotology amd Oncology, Shanghai, China Background/Objectives: This study was to provide a description review and improve our understanding of the treatment outcome of pediatric anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) in China. Design/Methods: The clinical data and outcomes of patients under16 years with newly histopathologicallyconfirmed ALCL treated in 10 large single institutions in China between January 2009 and June 2013, were retrospectively analyzed. The eventfree survival (EFS) was analyzed using the KaplanMeier method. The risk of disease progression or relapse was evaluated using logistic regression analysis. Significance was defined as P < 0.05. Results: Of the 80 eligible patients, the median age was 8.4 years (range, 1.3 15.7 years). Two patients (3%) were Stage I, 9 (11%) Stage II, 64 (80 %) Stage III, and 5 (6%) Stage IV.The median time of followup was 25.2 months (range, 7.1 74.8 months), 55 patients survived without disease at the last of followup, the 3year EFS was 65%\u00b16%. Sixtyfive patients (81%) were with and 15cases with regimens. The vs.65%\u00b120%(P=0.21).(,. The 3year EFS was 57%\u00b17% and 78%\u00b111% for patients with or without B symptoms(P=0.01). Twentyfour patients experienced disease progression or relapse. The median time from initial diagnosis to tumor failure was7.0 months (ranged, 1.5 42.6 months) (median,). At the last evaluation, there were 5 patients still aliveafter disease progression and relapse. By univariate analysis, sex (P=0.04) and B symptoms (P=0.00) were identified as risk factors of disease progression or relapse. Nevertheless, only B symptoms (HR 5.60 95% CI 1.4721.27, P0.05) wererisk factors in multivariate analysis. Conclusions: The presenting features of children and adolescents with ALCL and EFS rates in this study were similar to those reported by western countries. Refinement of therapeutic strategies to improve survival for patients with disease progression or relapse should be the priority in future clinical study. O-123 Preclinical Efficacy of Daratumumab in TCell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia K.L. Bride CenterMission Bay, Pediatrics, San Francisco, USA; 3Seattle Children's Hospital, Pathology, Seattle, USA Background/Objectives: Targeted immunotherapy has become critical for the successful treatment of many cancers, particularly therapeutic antibodies with cytotoxic abilities. No effective immunotherapies have been developed for Tcell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (TALL). CD38 is found on the cell surface of activated T cells, terminally differentiated B cells, but relatively low levels on normal lymphoid and myeloid cells. Daratumumab (dara) is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to CD38 and is successfully used in patients with refractory multiple myeloma. Design/Methods: To ensure CD38 is a relevant target, we measured CD38 expression by flow cytometry from 21 patients with TALL (10 early Tcell precursor (ETP) and 11 nonETP) at diagnosis and after induction chemotherapy. We also xenografted primary ALL blasts from 15 different patients, 7 with ETPALL and 8 with nonETP TALL. Mice were randomized to dara (200 g /mouse intraperitoneally weekly) vs isotype (200 g/mouse; 5 mice per arm for each sample) after they developed >1% peripheral blood (pb) blasts by FACS. Disease burden was assessed by FACS enumeration of pb blasts weekly and splenic blasts at sacrifice. Results: CD38 was expressed in all 21 patient samples and surface expression remained unchanged after induction (mean CD38 MFI at diagnosis vs endinduction: 3.27 vs 3.19 log (p = 0.25). All 7 ETP TALL samples responded with marked improvement in disease burden. For 5 of 8 of the nonETP TALL samples, mice with advanced disease died immediately after exposure to dara, presumably from tumor lysis. We repeated experiments treating after injection but prior to development of peripheral blasts with 7 of 8 nonETP ALL samples demonstrating efficacy to daratumumab (2 responded at high disease burden, 5 responded at low disease burden but had toxicity with high disease, and 1 did not respond). Conclusions: In summary, dara is a highly effective novel monotherapy for TALL in preclinical models. O-124 Therapeutic Targeting of Mutant P53 in Pediatric Acute Lymphobastic Leukemia S. Demir1, Q. Sun1, E. Tausch2, S. Selivanova6, K.M. Debatin1, L. Meyer 1 1Ulm University Medical Center, Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm, Germany; 2Ulm University Medical Center, Internal Medicine III, Ulm, Germany; 3University of Padova, Department of Women's and Children's Health, Padova, Italy; 4Charit\u00e9 University Medicine, Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Berlin, Germany; 5Ulm University Medical Center, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Ulm, Germany; 6Karolinska Institute, Department of Microbiology Tumor and Cell Biology, Stockholm, Sweden Background/Objectives: Mutations in the tumor suppressor gene TP53 (TP53mut) are infrequent at initial diagnosis of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) but enriched at relapse and associated with inferior outcome. Here, we evaluate mutated p53 as target for directed therapy and investigate the effects of the p53targeting small molecule APR246. Design/Methods: Patient, patientderived xenograft (NOD/SCID/huALL) and analyzed for TP53mut (highperformance liquid chromatography, Sanger sequencing). Sensitivities for the DNA damaging agent doxorubicin and the p53targeting small molecule APR246 (kindly provided by Aprea, Stockholm, Sweden) were investigated. Apoptosis activation, AnnexinV/propidium iodide p53 restoration (immunoprecipitation with conformationspecific antibodies) and activation (p53pSer15, expression of p53 downstream molecules) were analyzed. p53 deficient cells were generated by lentiviral shRNA mediated knockdown. Xenograft ALL bearing NOD/SCID mice with APR246 or vehicle. Results: In TP53mut leukemias, we observed a poor response to doxorubicin but sensitivity in TP53wt ALL. In contrast, TP53mut ALL were highly sensitive to APR246 while TP53wt leukemias showed insensitivity. APR246 induced structural restoration of mutant p53 and functional p53 activation as indicated by p53 wildtype conformation, p53 phosphorylation and increased expression of p53 target molecules NOXA and PUMA, finally leading to leukemia cell apoptosis. Knockdown of p53 in TP53mut ALL led to abrogation of cell death, indicating that APR246 targets mutant p53. Moreover, a strong synergism and resensitization to DNAdamage induced cell death was observed upon combined APR246 and doxorubicin exposure. Importantly, in a preclinical setting we treated TP53mut ALL bearing recipient mice with APR246 and observed a significant reduction in leukemia load demonstrating clear in vivo activity of APR246. Conclusions: In BCPALL, APR246 restores mutant p53 to wild type conformation and reactivates its tumor suppressor function leading to apoptosis induction. Targeting mutated p53 might provide an effective novel strategy for therapeutic intervention in this highrisk subtype of ALL. O-125 TreatmentRelated VenoOcclusive Disease in Children with De Novo Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia During Intensification C. McAtee 1, N. Schneller1, J. Brackett1, M.B. Bernhardt2, S. Pharmacology, Houston, USA Background/Objectives: Venoocclusive disease (VOD) has been described following treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with 6thioguanine (6TG). Previous studies incorporating daily 6TG into maintenance chemotherapy demonstrated a high incidence of VOD, typically presenting after prolonged exposures to 6TG. 6TG continues to be used as a single, 14day burst during intensification, however, VOD associated with brief courses of 6TG is poorly described. We describe our singleinstitution experience with VOD in this setting. Design/Methods: Subjects were identified from de novo patients with ALL at Texas Children's Cancer Center between 1/1/08 and 10/28/16 through medical record searches for those diagnosed with VOD within 60 days of receiving 14 days of 6TG. Subject demographic and clinical data were collected. Medians and ranges were calculated. Results: Of 680 new patients with ALL, 10 (1.5%) were identified with VOD. No predominant sex, ethnicity or race was noted. VOD was diagnosed 16.5 (642) days from starting 6TG. Isolated thrombocytopenia was noted in 9/10 patients and presented 5 (034) days prior to VOD, with 8/10 of these patients being clinically stable outpatients and 7/10 patients still taking 6TG. Refractoriness to platelet transfusions was noted in 8/10 patients, presenting 2 days prior to VOD with 7/8 of these being stable outpatients and 3/8 still taking 6TG. Fever was noted in 7/10 patients within 24 hours and 6/10 had documented or suspected infection in the 14 days prior to VOD. Intermediate thiopurine methyltransferase genotype was noted in 5/8 patients with data available. Conclusions: VOD generally presents early following initiation of 6TG in intensification phases of ALL treatment. Disproportionally severe thrombocytopenia and transfusion refractoriness typically preceded VOD diagnosis by several days, occurring in clinically stable outpatients. Identifying risk factors and early signs and symptoms of VOD in this population can hasten appropriate diagnosis/treatment, and in some cases, may allow for discontinuation of the offending 6TG. Free Paper Session: Liver Tumours and Rare Tumours O-126 Survival and Lates Effects of JPLT (Japanese Study Group for Rediatric Liver Tumor)2 RiskStratified Study for Hepatoblastoma E. Hospital, Peditric Surgery, Hiroshima, Japan; 2Japanese children cancer group, Liver tumor committee, Tokyo, Japan Background/Objectives: The Japanese Study Group for Pediatric Liver Tumor (JPLT)2 study for hepatoblastoma (HBL) launched in 1999 and closed in 2012. The main aim of this study launched to evaluate the efficacy of cisplatin/pirarubicin in riskstratified HB: standard risk HB (a tumor involving three or fewer sectors of the liver), intermediate risk HB (a tumor involving all sectors of the liver or invasion into portal or hepatic vein) and high risk HB (a tumor involving all sectors of the liver or with metastasis). Design/Methods: Until 2012, 360 HB children who were younger than 15 years of age were eligible for inclusion in the JPLT2 study in which the cisplatin/pirarubicin regimen (CITA) is kept as the first line. In this study, we examined the outcome and late effects of the HB patients by the riskstratified three groups (standard, intermediate and high risk groups). Results: Among 360 cases, PRETEXT I was 25, II was 117, III was 134, and IV was 84 including 61 cases (17%) with metastatic tumors. The 5year EFS/OS of the cases with standard risk HB were 77/92%, while those of the cases with Intermediate and high risk HB was 59/74% and 38/46%, respectively. Except for 40 cases who underwent primary resection, complete resection of primary after CITA was performed 98% of standard risk, 76% of intermediate risk and 86% of high risk patients. And the late phase complications were 51 cases with maldevelopment, 20 with cardiac complications, 65 with ototoxicity and 8 with second malignancies. Conclusions: As compared with other multicenter cooperative protocols, CITA regimens achieved similar rates of survival and resectability in standard risk patients. More promising strategies including adequate liver transplantation and new targeting drugs should be developed for intermediate and high risk HBs. O-127 AFP as a Biologic Marker and Prognostic Factor in NewlyDiagnosed Completely Resected Hepatoblastoma A. O'Neill Boston, USA; 2University of California Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center, Pediatric Oncology, Sacramento, USA; 3University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine, Research Preventive Medicine, Los Angeles, USA; 4Statistics and Data Center Children's Oncology Bonheur Children's Hospital and University of Tennessee, Department of Surgery, Memphis, USA; 7Primary Children's Hospital and University of Utah, Department of Surgery, Salt Lake City, USA; 8Vanderbilt University School of Medicine Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital, Pediatric Oncology, Nashville, USA Background/Objectives: Hepatoblastoma (HB) is the most common pediatric liver neoplasm. Greater than 90% of newly diagnosed patients present with an elevated serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP) level. The decline of AFP levels throughout therapy is routinely utilized as a marker of response however the exact relationship between AFP decline and outcome is not well established. Design/Methods: Children's Oncology Group (COG) protocol AHEP0731 was designed for patients with newly diagnosed HB and included a stratum for lowrisk patients with disease that was resected at diagnosis and followed by two adjuvant cycles of cisplain, 5fluorouracil, and vincristine (C5V). AFP levels were obtained per protocol at diagnosis, during therapy, and at routine offtherapy followup visits every 6 months. We analyzed AFP levels at diagnosis, and decline in response to therapy until normal, per institutional standards indicating \"complete remission.\" Results: Fiftyone subjects were enrolled on the lowrisk stratum, 49 of whom were eligible for this analysis. Mean AFP at diagnosis was 70,582 ng/mL, excluding two patients that lacked baseline values (median: 15,881, range: 104391,410 ng/mL). AFP values normalized in subjects as follows: 6 patients during therapy, 26 patients at the endoftherapy, and 14 and 1 patient(s) at 6 and 12 months offtherapy, respectively. Two subjects failed to normalize AFP. There was no difference in outcome based on the timing of normalization of AFP levels. All patients who recurred had progressive reelevation of successive AFP levels. Minor transient increases (levels < 100 ng/ml) in AFP were observed and did not necessarily indicate relapse. Conclusions: In patients with upfront, resected disease, timetonormalization of AFP levels was not predictive of overall outcome. AFP as an indicator of relapse is highly sensitive. O-128 PARP1Dependent Chromosomal Domains Determine the Development of Aggressive Hepatoblastoma by Activating Multiple Pathways of Cancer L. Valanejad Kiefer M. Weirauch2, N. Timchenko1 1Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Division of Pediatric General and Thoracic Surgery, Cincinnati, USA; 2Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Center Autoimmune Genomics and Etiology, Cincinnati, USA Background/Objectives: Hepatoblastoma (HBL) is a pediatric liver cancer that affects children under the age of three. Reduction of tumor suppressor proteins (TSPs) is seen in many types of liver cancer. Surprisingly, we found that aggressive, chemoresistant HBLs are characterized by an elevation of TSPs. Our goals were to determine mechanisms by which aggressive HBL neutralizes activities of elevated TSPs; elucidate mechanisms that elevate TSPs in aggressive cancer; and examine if the inhibition of these mechanisms inhibit HBL. Design/Methods: Using RNASeq and biochemical approaches, we analyzed a large cohort of HBL samples. Posttranslational modifications of 5 TSPs (Rb, p53, C/EBP, HNF4 and CUGBP1) and proteinprotein complexes of these TSPs examined using HPLCbased size exclusion chromatography, CoIP, and 2D gel electrophoresis. Changes in chromatin structure were examined using ChIP assays. Results: While HBL samples with a mild phenotype have reduced levels of TSPs, aggressive HBL is characterized by an elevation of TSPs that underwent posttranslational modifications eliminating their tumor suppression activities. We found that genes of each TSP contain a unique 250 base pair chromosomal domain (Aggressive Liver Cancer Domains (ALCDs)). The human genome contains 30 ALCDs located in chromosomal regions of 5 TSPs and certain cancer related genes, but ALCDs are not observed in the mouse genome. ALCDs and corresponding genes are activated by an elevation of PARP1/Ku80/Ku70 complexes, which bind directly to ALCDs. Inhibition of PARP1 in cultured hepatoblastoma cells eliminates PARP1/Ku80/Ku70 complexes and inhibits or normalizes expression of corresponding genes resulting in an inhibition of proliferation. Conclusions: Activation of ALCDs by PARP1 is a key event in the development of aggressive HBL. This phenotype also involves posttranslational modifications that block their tumor suppression activities. Activation of PARP1 is a mechanism for development of aggressive HBL suggesting that FDAapproved PARP1 inhibitors might be used for treatment of chemoresistant HBL. O-129 Genetic and Epigenetic Analyses of Hepatoblastoma Identify Subgroups with Different Clinical and Biological Features M. Sekiguchi 1, M. Seki1, T. Kawai2, T. Isobe1, S. Ogawa3, J. of Tokyo, Department of Pediatrics, Bunkyoku, Japan; 2National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, Department of MaternalFetal Biology, Setagayaku, Japan; 3Kyoto University, Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Kyoto, Japan; 4The University of Tokyo Hospital, Department of Pediatric Surgery, Bunkyoku, Japan; 5The Institute of Medical Science The University of Tokyo, Human Genome Center, Minatoku, Japan; 6Kyushu University, Department of Pediatric Surgery, Fukuoka, Japan; Children's Medical Center, Department of Hematology/Oncology, Saitama, Japan; Red Cross Gunma Blood Center, Director, Maebashi, Japan; 9Nagoya Medical Center, Department of Advanced Diagnosis, Nagoya, Japan; 10Kanagawa Children's Medical Center, Department of Pathology, Yokohama, Japan Background/Objectives: Hepatoblastoma (HBL) is the most common liver tumor in children. Despite intensive multimodal therapy, the prognosis of highrisk HBL remains poor, and this underscores the importance of understanding HBL pathogenesis and developing novel therapeutic modalities. However, as the mutation rate in HBL is relatively low and molecular targets except for Wnt/betacatenin pathway have not been established, our understanding of the molecular basis of HBL is still limited. Design/Methods: We performed methylation array single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arraybased copy number (CN) analysis on 38 samples of HBL. A part of the samples were also subjected to wholeexome sequencing (WES, 10 samples) and RNA sequencing (RNAseq, 18 samples). Results: We identified mutations/deletions of CTNNB1 in all samples subjected to WES/RNAseq. No other recurrent mutation or gene fusion was detected. Consensus clustering of 38 samples based on methylation data indicated the presence of 3 distinct clusters. Cluster 1 was characterized by high expression of LGALS1 associated with the promoter hypomethylation and marked by low diagnostic age. Intriguingly, cluster 1 included most of the cases with uniparental disomy/trisomy of chromosome 11p. As for cluster 2, all but one case had 1q/2q gains. Cluster 2 included most of the cases staged as PRETEXT IV that required liver transplant. Cluster 3 exhibited low expression of NQO1 with the promoter hypermethylation and less frequent CN alterations. Patients with relatively low serum AFP levels were enriched in this cluster. Being consistent with low expression of NQO1, known as a poor prognostic factor in several kinds of tumors, patients in cluster 3 showed better eventfree survival than the others (100% vs 56.0%, p = 0.046). Conclusions: Our integrated genomewide study of HBL identified methylation subgroups well correlated with biological and clinical features. It may be useful for clinical risk stratification and searching for new molecular targets. O-130 Patterns of Care and Treatment Outcomes of Pancreatic Tumors in Children: an Analysis of the National Cancer Database O. Picado1, J. Tashiro1, K. Rao1, J. Sola1, E. Perez 1 1University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Surgery, Miami, USA Background/Objectives: Pancreatic tumors are rare in children and limited data is available. We aimed to describe patient and tumor characteristics and to report on survival of this disease. Design/Methods: Data from the National Cancer Database (20042013) on children younger than 18 years with pancreatic tumors were analyzed. The association between treatment and hazard of death was assessed using KaplanMeier method and Cox regression model. Results:We identified 86 children with pancreatic tumors; 52% were male, 56% white nonHispanic, and 90% insured. Median age at diagnosis was 14 (IQR: 916) years. Tumors were distributed as resection. Most patients (75%, n=45) had lymph node examination, and 22% had positive samples. Twenty percent (n=17) received adjuvant therapies; chemotherapy therapy, respectively. Fiveyear overall survival for all pancreatic tumors was 61%. Fiveyear significant nonsurgical management (HR: 4.07, 95%CI: 1.56-10.62, p<0.001) remained independent predictor of worse survival on multivariate analysis. Conclusions: Overall survival of children with pancreatic tumors is grim, with varying survival rates among different tumors. Surgical management of pancreatic tumors in children is associated with longterm survival. O-131 NUT Midline Carcinoma in Children and Adults: A Multicenter Retrospective Study L. Lemelle 1, G. Pierron2, Fr\u00e9neaux3, Huybrechts4, Carton14, D. Orbach15 1Institut Lille, France; 8CHU Sainte Justine University of Montreal, Department of HematologyOncology, Montreal, Canada; Villejuif, France; 15Institut Curie, Department of Pediatric Adolescent Young Adults French Pediatric Rare Tumor group groupe Fracture, Paris, France Background/Objectives: NUT midline carcinoma is an aggressive tumor defined by the presence of NUT rearrangement (BRD3/4NUT fusion oncogene) with a poor prognosis. This rare cancer is underdiagnosed and poorly treated. The primary objective of this study was to describe the clinical, radiologic and biological features of NUT midline carcinoma. The secondary objective was to describe the various treatments and assess their efficacy. Design/Methods: This retrospective multicenter study was based on review of the medical records of children and adults with NUT midline carcinoma with specific rearrangement or positive antiNUT nuclear staining (>50%). Results: This series of 12 patients had a median age of 18.1 years (ranges: 12.3 - 49.7 years). The primary tumor was located in the chest in 8 patients, the head and neck in 3 patients and 1 patient had a multifocal tumor. Nine patients presented regional lymph node involvement and 8 distant metastases. Onehalf of patients were initially misdiagnosed and diagnosis of NMC was therefore subsequently corrected by targeted molecular biology analyses. Specific NUT antibody was positive in all cases tested. The specific BRD4NUT translocation was found in 10/12 patients. A transient response to chemotherapy was observed in 4/11 patients. Only 2 patients were treated by surgery and 5 received radiotherapy with curative intent. Three out of 12 patients received targeted therapy. At the end of followup, only one patient was still in remission more than 12 years after the diagnosis. Median overall survival was 4.7 months (95%CI: 2.117.7). Conclusions: NUT midline carcinoma is an aggressive disease refractory to conventional therapy. Early diagnosis by NUTspecific antibody immunostaining in cases of undifferentiated or poorly differentiated carcinoma to identify the specific rearrangement of NUT gene is useful for diagnosis. It should lead to propose optimal therapeutic strategy with early inclusion in targeted therapy studies. Childhood Cancer International (CCI) O-132 A Childhood Cancer Parent's Guide to Transforming Pediatric Cancer Policy in Your State J. Bloyd 1 1American Childhood Cancer Organization, Lexington, USA Background/Objectives: The objective of this presentation is to empower parents of childhood cancer patients and survivors to effectively engage policy makers to raise awareness about childhood cancer and the need for additional resources. The presenter will share about her personal experience in forming partnerships with state legislators and the Governor to pass legislation making Kentucky a national model for change. Mrs. Bloyd is the mother of a Burkitts Lymphoma Leukemia survivor, Paxton. She worked for KY Governor Ernie Fletcher as well as U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in D.C., and as a grassroots advocacy lobbyist/consultant for the American Heart Association, Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, and Americans for NonSmokers Rights prior to her son's diagnosis. Design/Methods: Mrs. Bloyd will use her experience as a case study to reveal pitfalls and pearls for effective grassroots advocacy. Results: Mrs. Bloyd led the way in Kentucky drafting legislation to create a new pediatric cancer research trust fund. This initiative is funded through an innovative approach giving Kentucky residents the opportunity to donate via their annual state income tax return. As a result of her leadership, Mrs. Bloyd was appointed by the Governor to the board and elected President. Mrs. Bloyd also led the way in changing Kentucky's Cancer Action Plan to include specific objectives regarding childhood cancer research and survivorship. To commemorate International Childhood Cancer Day Jamie recently partnered with Governor Matt Bevin and the First Lady in launching KY's firstever pediatric cancer advocacy day at the State Capitol. Conclusions: Although childhood cancer is the number one cause of death by disease for children, the issue goes largely unnoticed by state policy makers. Effective advocacy at the grassroots level has the power to change the political landscape in making childhood cancer a priority issue. O-133 The Best Interests of the Paediatric Oncology Patient: A Case Study Where Medical Professionals and Carers do not Agree T. Di Lallo 1 1Royal Children's Hospital, Parent's Advisory Group Children's Cancer Centre, Parkville, Background / Objectives: Background: In December 2015, Oshin Kiszko was diagnosed with a rare brain tumour, medulloblastoma. Oshin was then six years old. He died in December 2016. Following surgery in December 2015, curative treatment comprising intensive chemotherapy and craniospinal radiotherapy was indicated. Oshin's parents were advised accordingly. Oshin's parents initially opposed the administration of chemotherapy. They subsequently agreed to limited chemotherapy, but otherwise preferred to pursue alternative therapies. They declined radiotherapy under any circumstances. Litigation took place between Oshin's parents and the treating Hospital. Objectives: Consideration of the legal/ethical issues which emerge when legal guardians seek to limit medical treatment for the infant patient in the exercise of their parental entitlement to protect their child's welfare. Identification of how the legal and ethical issues become especially acute where the indicated medical treatment takes the form of \"special medical procedures\" as that term is understood by law. Analysis of why the Court ultimately deferred to the wishes of Oshin's legal guardians concerning ongoing medical treatment in preference to the recommendations of the child's treating medical professionals. Design/Methods: Nil. Results: Nil. Conclusions: The 'bests interests' approach to the consideration of patient welfare does not offer a specific hierarchy of values. The application of the \"best interests' approach in the case of the individual patient is multifaceted and intricate, especially in the context of \"special medical procedures\". Best interests are values, not facts. Therefore, complex ethical and legal issues intrude into otherwise clinical questions. The wishes of legal guardians are protected by law and cannot lightly be derogated from. O-134 \"Getting More Bang for Your Buck\" The Perspective of a Notfor Profit on Innovative Strategies to Get Better value for Money for Medical Assistance H. Gupta 1, A. Taluja2, K. Sawhney1, P. Bagai1, A. Mahajan1 1Cankids...Kidscan, Medical Projects and Support Service Program, Delhi, India; 2Cankids...Kidscan, Quality Control Research and Impact, Delhi, India Background/Objectives: Drugs cost is a significant component of the overall financial burden in the management of childhood cancer. The diverse healthcare dynamics in India leads to a significant albeit variable part of this burden being passed on to the families. Cankids is a grassroots level organization providing holistic support to pediatric oncology patients at 45 centers in India. Support for medications currently constitutes the biggest outlay in our annual expenditure. It is therefore, vital for us to find ways to cut costs without compromising on the quality of treatment. The aim of this study was to quantify the cost reduction achieved using various strategies. Design/Methods: Medical Assistance team of cankids selects and procures chemotherapy/supportive drugs directly from pharmaceutical companies for all Cankids supported Hospital units. Drugs requiring coldchain are delivered through local stockists of parent company. As a general principle generics approved by Drug General Controller of India are procured. Bulk purchasing facilitates better negotiation in prices and value additions such as some complimentary vials and diagnostics. Billing centrally leads to avoidance of higher taxes at state level. Attempt was made for the purpose of this study to quantify the overall economic benefit using the above strategies for five commonly prescribed, key drugs LAsparaginase, Imatinib, Filgrastim, Voriconazole, Meropenem. Results: provided medical assistance to 4531 patients, with total outlay of $551,655. By using generics for 4 of these 5 drugs we had a cost reduction of 63%. For native Asparaginase only innovator product was used. Apart from this, by using above mentioned strategies, a reduction of 58% in the retail price of final purchased generic drugs was achieved. Conclusions: Significant cost reductions can be achieved in partnership with pharmaceutical industry enabling support groups to reach out to more patients. O-135 Increasing Fundraising Capacity for Parent Run Organizations in LMICs M. Hamid 1, S. Choudhury1 1ASHIC Foundation, Pediatric Oncology, Dhaka, Bangladesh Background/Objectives: LMICs struggle with a multitude of indigenous socioeconomic issues, making it difficult to raise the fundraising capacity for small parentrun organizations focused on a specific cause such as childhood cancer. In a country such as Bangladesh, malnutrition, education and communicable diseases receive the lion's share of public funding and attention. Specialized causes such as childhood cancer are forced to resort to private sources of funding. Unequal distribution of wealth keeps more than 90% of the country's wealth in the hands of the select few, who make their own decisions on what projects to fund. Most have causes in their own communities or extended families that they choose to support, and as a result specialized programs such as support for childhood cancer gets ignored. Design/Methods: With a track record of swindlers in the community, individuals are also slow to trust private nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) unless they have a personal connection with the administrators of the organization. Formed in 1994, ASHIC Foundation got its start with 100% of its small budget funded by private funds from the founders of the organization. Maheen Hamid, daughter of the founders Afzal & Salma Choudhury, will share the family's journey over the last two decades. This includes relationship building with the local medical communities, tapping into international networks/ partners, building credibility of ASHIC Programs by being consistent and dedicated service providers and many other factors that have helped to build the trustworthiness of the organization. Results: Today, the organization gets about 70% of its current $100,000 annual budget from private donations, including those from individuals and institutions. Conclusions: Several parent run organizations in LMICs may be able to benefit from the effective strategies employed by ASHIC Foundation, and the organization's plans to leverage new marketing tools for increasing fundraising capacity. O-136 Developing an Intelligent Resource Mobilization Strategy in Response to Rapid Growth of Programs Focussed on Change for Childhood Cancer in India A. Kumar 1, P. Bagai1, G. Nagar1, K. Sawhney1 CanKids...KidsCan (CK) - a grassroot level notforprofit organization works for Change for Childhood Cancer in India and You Are Not Alone (YANA) Social Support Protocol; executed through their social support teams working in 44 cancer centres across India providing holistic support ( Range of 18 services) to provide best standards of treatment, care and support. Hence, requires fundraising & implementable resource mobilization roadmap. Design/Methods: Adaptive fundraising strategy Evolving corporate atmosphere has brought into limelight the corporate social responsibilities (CSR) of each organization. Project/programs created developed according to CSR needs Building expertise by Working with different stakeholders, Developing fundraising roadmap. donor management tools sales force ( 4616 donors) Building corpus fund Community involvement through Seven Care centers, for cancer children for focused interventions Donation in kind - involving community through their time, food and supplies. Events Awareness - through disease based national campaign, survivor specific campaigns and statewide car rallies Networking through fundraising dinners Other Fundraising tools Crowd & bite sized fundraising Using network's network fundraising target setting Schools /institutional partnerships Results: Five year trend: Increase in funds raised from USD 460,000 to USD 945,000 to 1,280,000USD to 1,450,000USD to USD 2,000,000 Number of hospitals supported has increased from 27 to 44 Previous two year comparison 56% in 201516 to 65% in 201617 raised through project funds Increase from previous year funds raised - 33% in 201516 to 66% in 201617 Strong database of continual group/ individual relationships for future Conclusions: Donor focussed projects led to renewable partnerships, reducing reliance on foreign funding Team strengthening is essential for sustainability Multiple fundraising tools helped increase donations and flexibility to implement programs Effective low cost models for fundraising. Community involvement shoulders some burden of fundraising O-137 Charity Role in International Paediatric Cancer Clinical Trials S. Kennedy 1, D. Ludwinski1, S. Richards2, N. Bird2, L. Knox2, J. Programs, New York, USA; 2Solving Kids' Cancer Europe, Research Programs, London, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: International clinical trials are becoming increasingly important in paediatric cancers to facilitate faster accrual rates and provide wider access to children for testing new therapies. Challenges of increased design and monitoring complexities, regulatory burden, and cost remain significant. This presents an opportunity for charities to stimulate and support international collaborations between academia, industry, government agencies, and nonprofits. Design/Methods: Research advocacy by an international charity based in the US and UK identified unmet needs for children with neuroblastoma. A call for proposals was issued to the international research community to submit ideas for combination immunotherapy. An international panel of scientific reviewers selected a proposal to recommend for the award. Another clinical trial testing a targeted drug planned in a US consortium was expanded to include UK and Europe due to charity support and influence. Seven additional charities in the US and UK are supporting these trials. Results: Two international clinical trials testing novel therapies in neuroblastoma influenced and supported by charity advocacy are due to open in 2017. One is testing targeted radiotherapy 131IMIBG with immunotherapy combination using antiGD2 antibody dinutuximabbeta and antibody nivolumab and will accrue relapsed and refractory neuroblastoma patients in US, UK, and Germany (NCT02914405). The second is a thirdgeneration ALK inhibitor lorlatinib for children with ALKpositive neuroblastoma that will accrue patients in US, UK, and France. Conclusions: Charities advocating for and supporting innovative international clinical trials are providing an essential role in stimulating trials that will accrue in a timely manner and address the need for more therapeutic options across borders for children with cancer. O-138 Have A Heart for Children with Cancer: A Campaign to Raise Awareness of and Funds for Children living with Cancer L. Moore 1 1CHOC Childhood Cancer Foundation SA, Gauteng South Region, Saxonwold, South Africa Background/Objectives: The nonprofit sector in South Africa has become increasingly more competitive which has resulted in a scramble for available funds. CHOC Childhood Cancer Foundation South Africa (CHOC), the largest childhood cancer NGO operating in the African continent, developed a national awareness and fundraising campaign entitled \"Have a Heart for Children with Cancer\" with the primary aim of raising awareness of childhood cancer and funds for the organisation. Design/Methods: The \"Have a Heart for Children with Cancer\" campaign is linked to ICCD on the 15th February, In 2015 CHOC identified the need to formalize and give structure to the campaign. The campaign went blue to align with the corporate identity of the organisation and merchandise was developed with the \"heart\" theme. A round plastic pin that could be worn on the days leading up to and on the 15th February was designed, together with a chocolate to fit the Valentine's day theme. Both items were branded with the \"Have a Heart Children with Cancer\" slogan. The campaign encourages people \"go blue\" on the day and wear their badges and pins - all in support of childhood cancer and CHOC. Linked to this was a national media, social media and advertising campaign, including the lighting up of Table Mountain in Cape Town and a National Monument in Pretoria in the blue colour theme. Results: There has been an increase in the number of people being made aware of CHOC and childhood cancer. This is evident in the number of media articles/interviews, the number of participants aligning themselves to the campaign and the increase in sales of \"Have a Heart for Children with Cancer\" merchandise. Conclusions: The \"Have a Heart for Children with Cancer\" campaign is an effective awareness and fundraising campaign that has seen increased support for both CHOC and childhood cancer. O-139 Children Raising Funds for Children: Implementing an Effective Fundraising Campaign in Schools in Gauteng, South Africa L. Moore 1 1CHOC Childhood Cancer Foundation SA, Gauteng South Region, Saxonwold, South Africa Background/Objectives: It is important that nonprofit organisations leverage support from a wide variety of income sources. An effective way of doing this is implementing a holistic school giving programme that is mutually beneficial to both the organisation and the school. There is increased pressure on children today to be effective and contributing citizens of society. The opportunities for charities to get maximum benefit from this social movement are enormous and CHOC has been extremely successful in leveraging off these opportunities in its fundraising efforts. Design/Methods: This initiative is broken into four key sections: monetary activities, community service opportunities, social responsibility clubs and collections of inkind donations. Key activities promoted in schools include: civvies days, where children pay a donation to wear clothing of their choice to school (often linked to national/international awareness campaigns related to childhood cancer); collection of items that are needed to implement core programmes; opportunities for social responsibility clubs to engage with CHOC at its operational sites, assisting in various activities such as painting, cleaning, preparing meals and administration tasks and; providing opportunities for individual learners to gain both passive and active community hours through assisting with campaigns, events and fundraising initiatives. Results: There has been a steady increase in the number of schools and learners getting involved in CHOC initiatives. Monetary income has increased and currently accounts for 11% of overall income received. There has been over a 100% increase in the amount of inkind donations received which has a huge impact on reducing expenditure. Conclusions: A well planned and implemented schools fundraising campaign will see steady growth over a period of time and can comprise a significant portion of an organisations income. It opens opportunities to gain access to other income sources whilst assisting in shaping future leaders who will become active members of society contributing to social change. O-140 Creating and Developing Games Throughout Interdisciplinarity and Patient Participation S. Mozzilli 1, E. Sassi2, L. Rossi3, V. Sonaglio4, Pediatric Oncology, Chicago, USA Background/Objectives: In an increasingly technological world, digital information about childhood cancer that is easily accessible to pediatric patients, their families and healthcare providers is still missing. In this scenario, we decided to bring all stakeholders - patients, caregivers, healthcare professionals, creatives and entrepreneurs together to create an application for tablet and mobile devices that would help children demystify cancer and its treatment. Design/Methods: 1 Interdisciplinarity: which involves the combination of two or more academic disciplines into one activity; 2 Design Thinking: a human centered methodology for a rapid ideation with the ability to visualize and adapt the results in near real time; 3 Agile UX: a methodology which integrates the user experience design and developer team; 4 Patient Centered Design; 5 Project Management Platforms; 6 Collaboration and Communication Tools. Results: 1 Development of an application with 20 minigames for iOS and Android platforms, in a language that is easily accessible to children with an attractive an colorful interface where the child can identify him/herself with a custom designed character that guides them through different steps of the treatment. The initiative was highlighted in the AppStore and resulted in almost 4 million views. 2 Acquisition and expansion of interdisciplinarity for all stakeholders. 3 And most importantly, development of empathy and compassion for our patients. Conclusions: The interdisciplinarity and the effective participation of all the stakeholders in the project, allowed an integrated access to information, facilitating the understanding, identification, codification and availability of information that resulted in generation of easily accessible knowledge to our targeted population. The greatest transformation was not only in the technological advance itself, but in our new way to associate knowledge with human factors in order to educate, empower and improve the quality of life of children fighting cancer. www.beaba.org/games O-141 A Childhood Cancer Parent's Experience with CBD (Cannabidiol) HEMP Oil as a Substitute for Pain Relief and Anxiety D. MujagicCammett 1 1Parent, n/a, Bethesda, USA Background/Objectives: The objective of this presentation is to inform and empower the parents of childhood cancer patients of pain remedy and anxiety alternatives and to raise awareness among oncologists and researchers of the potential such natural alternatives could provide to patients who do not respond positively to conventional medicine. The presenter will share her personal experience introducing CBD hemp oil as a substitute for pain treatment and anxiety during her daughter Sabrina's treatment for Neuroblastoma. Mrs. MujagicCammett is the mother of a Neuroblastoma patient, Sabrina who battled this disease on and off for nine years before passing in October 2016 at the age of 12. Design/Methods: Mrs. MujagicCammett will present her experience as a case study of the success she had introducing cannabidiol hemp oil to combat Sabrina's pain and anxiety in order to inform parents and to spark the interest of doctors and researchers to explore the potential benefits of substituting hemp oil or other naturally occurring substances for opioids to address pain and anxiety during inpatient procedures. Results: While treating Sabrina both at home and in the hospital, Mrs. MujagicCammett confirmed that utilizing a natural product could produce an equivalent response versus a pharmaceutical in Sabrina's case. During her treatment, Sabrina did not exhibit nor express discomfort while provided with CBD to manage pain as her decease progressed. Conclusions: Mrs. MujagicCammett believes such options should be added to those presented to parents as an alternative to providing pain relief and reducing anxiety for their child during treatment. Also, that more studies should be conducted to determine the relative effectiveness of CBD hemp oil or other naturally occurring medicines as another choice for parents and doctors. O-142 Continuity of Oncology Care for Central American Migrant Children in the US M. OrjuelaGrimm 1, L. Fu2, R. Martinez3, L. Onesi4, MedinaPaez9, P. Satwani10 1Columbia University Medical Center, PediatricsOncology & Epidemiology, New York NYC, USA; Center, Pediatrics Oncology, New York CIty, USA; 5Columbia University Medical Center, Pediatrics Oncology & Social Work, New York City, USA; 6Columbia University Medical Center, Pediatrics Oncology & Psychology, New City, USA; 7Coalicion Americana, Epidemiology, New York City, USA; 10Columbia University Medical Center, Pediatrics BMT, New York City, USA Background/Objectives: During the past 4 years the numbers of Central American children migrating overland to the US has reached unprecedented levels, with > 93,000 migrating during 2016. Some children migrate while undergoing chemotherapy, interrupting intended care. We report a collaboration between pediatric oncology teams in sending and receiving countries permitting continuity of care despite complex legal circumstances. Design/Methods: A 4 year old girl undergoing maintenance therapy for B cell precursor standard risk ALL in Honduras, abandoned therapy, traveling overland to the US. After resettling in NYC she ran out of medications, developed fevers and was admitted in relapse at Columbia. After electronic discussion between NY and Honduran oncologists, she began relapse therapy, quickly achieving remission. PreBMT unrelated donor search yielded only 9/10 HLA matches. Sibling testing revealed a 10/10 HLA match in one 9 year old brother living in a remote Honduran village. Because of the nature of the family's migration to the US, he was ineligible for a tourist visa, and stem cells from Honduras could not enter the US. The NY oncologists working closely with a Jesuit human rights organization, a NY community organization, Honduran oncologists, and a volunteer immigration lawyer petitioned for the boy's US entry. Results: The 10/10 HLAmatched 9 year old was granted Humanitarian Parole by US Homeland Security within 3 months of HLA testing. Marrow donor assent and preparation for flying was done with video calling. The boy traveled 4 days later. BMT proceeded without complications. The girl was discharged on day +28. The donor returned to Honduras complying with his Parole. After day +180 the girl's family chose to return to Honduras where she is again followed by her Honduran oncologist, now in close electronic communication with the NY team. Conclusions: We propose technology facilitated binational oncologic continuity of care as a model for treatment during migration. O-143 UNITE2CURE Breaking the 18 Year AgeLimit Unite2Cure is partnering with Accelerate in order to remove the \"18 year ageof entry dogma\" within clinical trial designs. Ages of entry to adult trials should be flexible and based on considerations of biology and safety. Trials specifically for teenagers and young adults are less common even than for children.Adolescents tend to be grouped with children and thus are excluded from adult trials. We contend that inclusion in trials should be based on medical need rather than arbitrary age limits. Design/Methods: 1. The age of clinical trial entry should be reduced to 12 years in adult early phase cancer drug studies unless there are welljustifiable medical/scientific reasons not to do so. 2. No upper or lower age limit criteria for PhaseII and III trials- when AYA diseases present in both paediatric and adult populations- and have the same biology. 3. Trials enrolling adolescents should always be conducted in an ageappropriate setting 4. Adolescents should still be included in paediatric PhaseI, II and III trials- where relevant, to maximise therapeutic opportunities. 5. Young adults should be permitted to participate in paediatric Phase IIIII trials- especially for 'paediatric' type cancer. 6. The indication proposed in a regulatory marketing authorisation application for of a given cancer drug should include adolescents at the same time as the adult authorisation. Results: 1. Improved access of adolescents to new cancer drugs 2. Better understanding of biology and response of the MoA (Explore differences, if they exist, between adolescents and adults) 3. Positive influence in paediatric drug development (Early signs of activity in a paediatric disease present in adolescents) 4. Positive influence in adult drug development (Increased likelihood of achieving proof of concept/proof of principle for drugs with brand new mechanisms of action) Conclusions: Is it safe to recruit teenagers in adult early drug trials? YES, either in adult Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials O-144 The Promote, Protect and Support Malnutrition (PPSN) Model for Delivering Nutritional Support to Childhood Cancer Patients in India A. Sharma 1, P. Bagai1, M. Khurana1, N. Joshi1 1Cankids...Kidscan, Treatment Support Program, NEW DELHI, India Background/Objectives: A survey of nutritional practices for children with cancer in India in 2014 established that there is a deficiency of provision of nutritional services and variability in existing practices of nutritional assessment and intervention. To address the problem, Cankids, a not for profit childhood cancer organisation, developed the PPSN model. Design/Methods: Using the SIOP PODC algorithm as a starting point for nutritional assessment and intervention, the PPSN model provides the necessary resources. The resources include Dietitians and other staff.The dietician managed the nutrition status of the child through prospective assessment, 1 on 1 counselling and risk stratification.The social support team and a parent support group (PSG) worker work with the dietician to deliver the program. Information education communication materials on nutrition and hygiene Nutritional supplements,Desired home based and industrial supplementation are provided. In addition, advocacy and stakeholder engagement is promoted through a national group called POSHAN. Results: \u00b76 dieticians were provided and supported in 11 cancer centers in India in the last 12 months.40 PSG workers were trained for nutritional assessment. \u00b7144 sessions for awareness generation on nutrition and 288 session on hygiene maintenance were conducted.1 recipe exhibition was organised.15 Focus group discussions were conducted and equipment for anthropometric measurements were provided. A nutrition management guidebook for families in 3 languages and a snake and ladder game for child education was developed.. Feeding program was provided to 218 beneficiaries per month in 4 centers Supplementation support was provided to 400 patients based on risk stratification. \u00b7488 parents and children participated in the nutrition awareness campaign across India. Nutrition week was celebrated for awareness generation at community level. Conclusions: The PPSN model is feasible to deliver nutritional support in resourcelimited settings. Studies to measure impact are being planned. O-145 Enhancing Childhood Cancer Awareness through Road Show to the Urban Places in Indonesia A.U. Sudjoko 1 1Yayasan Onkologi Anak Indonesia, Secretary, Jakarta Barat, Indonesia Background/Objectives: To increase public awareness of children with cancer, the importance of early detection and subsequent care is the mission of the Indonesian Childhood Cancer Foundation or Yayasan Onkologi Anak Indonesia (YOAI). Indonesia is an archipelago of over 17.000 islands straddling the equator. Many are sparsely inhabited, some not at all. However, with a population over 250.000.000 there are very few oncologists or specialists for children with cancer and those are not found outside urban areas. Many children with cancer must travel far to find treatment in Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia. YOAI has taken the initiative to offer outreach by promoting seminars for laymen and professionals in our far flung communities with our Road Show. Design/Methods: Our road show gives informative presentations to public on awareness of children with cancer by cooperating with community health centers, schools and other relevant organizations. Scientific seminars are offered to doctors, nurses and students from academic medical institutions. We cooperate with hospitals and universities where the presentations are held. Results: Our Road Shows have helped raised awareness of children with cancer and their needs in regions outside urban areas and how to assist them in their forward needs. We also encourage doctors to become specialists in the field of childhood oncology. Conclusions: YOAI has been doing the Road Show for the past two years not only at the hospital in Jakarta but also in other cities such as Bandung, Jogyakarta, Solo, Surabaya, Padang, Medan, Garut and Cirebon. Our goal is to move on until we covered the whole provinces of Indonesia O-146 Using Thunderclap to Raise Awareness about #Kidscancerpain Over Social Media P. Tutelman 1, C. Chambers1, P. Nathan7, H. Witteman8 1IWK Centre, Centre for Pediatric Pain Research, Halifax, Canada; 2The Hospital for Sick Children, Child Health Evaluative Sciences, Toronto, Canada; 3The Hospital for Sick Children, Anesthesia and Pain Canada; 4IWK Health Centre, HematologyOncology, Canada; 5Multimed Inc., Cancer Toronto, Canada; 6University of Ottawa, Nursing, Ottawa, Canada; 7The Hospital for Sick Children, Haematology/Oncology, Toronto, Canada; 8Universit\u00e9 Laval, Family & Emergency Medicine, Quebec City, Canada; 9Independent Healthcare Consultant, Halifax, Canada Background/Objectives: Social media is increasingly being used to disseminate health information, connect experts with patients, and raise awareness about medical conditions. Funded by the Canadian Cancer Society, #KidsCancerPain is a social media campaign in partnership with the Cancer Knowledge Network aimed at delivering evidencebased information on pediatric cancer pain to parents. This study evaluated the use of Thunderclap, a crowdspeaking social media platform, to raise awareness about #KidsCancerPain. Design/Methods: A Thunderclap campaign introducing #KidsCancerPain was created. A Thunderclap is an organized social media event where supporters share a similar message via Twitter and/or Facebook on the same day at the same time. Supporters were invited via email/newsletter blasts, online promotion, and targeted invitations. To join, supporters authorized Thunderclap to send a preprogrammed message (\"No parent wants to see their child in pain. Help us in \"Making Cancer Less Painful for Kids\". #KidsCancerPain\") via their Twitter/Facebook account on the set date/time. Results: Between July 1327 2016, 366 unique social media accounts (Twitter, 61.5%; Facebook, 38.5%) joined the #KidsCancerPain Thunderclap, held July 27, 2016, 9pm ET. This resulted in a social reach of 1,672,727 people, making it the largest childhood cancer Thunderclap to date. Supporters were individuals (84.7%) and organizations (15.3%) and included cancer, health, research/academic, and pain groups (e.g., Canadian Cancer Society, WEGO Health etc.). The majority of supporters were from Canada (60.1%), followed by the United States (24.6%), Australia (8.2%) and the United Kingdom (3.3%). During the Thunderclap, #KidsCancerPain trended on Twitter in Canada (i.e., became a viral topic). Most supporters used the preprogrammed message (55.7%) and 11.7% modified the message. The content of the posts of 35.4% of supporters were unavailable due to privacy settings on accounts. Conclusions: Thunderclap was a novel and rapid way to build widespread awareness about pediatric cancer pain and the #KidsCancerPain campaign. Challenges and opportunities will be discussed. O-147 Developing and Publishing a Guideline Titled \"Siblings of Childhood Cancer Patients Things You Need to Have in Mind When You are with Them\" K. Yamashita 1, M. Ozawa2 1Children's Cancer Association of Japan, Chairman, Minatoku, Japan; 2St. Luke's International Hospital, Pediatrics, Cyuoku Tokyo, Japan Background/Objectives: Development and publication of various booklets and guidelines to serve the needs of patients and families is one of very important tasks of Children's Cancer Association of Japan known as CCAJ. Since 2000, four guidelines, i.e. \"Support to patients \"Educations of patients\", \"Supporting survivors\" and \"Palliative care\" were published. In 2013, a plan was started for developing the fifth guideline focusing \"Siblings\", whose difficulties are well known but no enough attention has been given. The guideline was concluded in Dec. 2016 and published in Feb. 2017. Design/Methods: A working group was organized of which members are, a sibling of childhood cancer patient, a mother, a farther, a survivor, a pediatrician, a nurse, a social worker, a primary school teacher and a nursery teacher. Started in 2013 in total 13 meetings of WG were held and enthusiastic discussions were made until the conclusion in Dec. 2016. In addition, open discussions were made in the annual open symposium held in conjunction with annual congress of JSPHO and JSPON from 2013 through 2016, and reflected in the final draft. Results: The guideline titled \"Siblings of childhood cancer patients -Things you need to have in main when you are with them\" was published in Feb. 2017. The guideline is written in the manner addressing to those who care about siblings describing various situations siblings face during and after the treatment of patients. The last section is designed to address to siblings with a key message \"you are not alone\". A card for the siblings to write and exchange messages is also enclosed as an attachment. Conclusions: The guideline is expected to be of helps to deepen understandings between siblings of childhood cancer patients and those who surround them including parents, and also to serve as a trigger for effective dialogue with siblings. Session 1: Neuroblastoma & Fertility O-148 Analysis of Surgery for Neuroblastoma in the Netherlands 1998 - 2014 M. Jans 1, G. Tytgat2, S. Zwaveling3,4, C. van de Ven1,5, S. Terwisscha van Heij1, Center, Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands; Center, Pediatric Surgery, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; 4Vrije Universiteit Medical Center, Pediatric Surgery, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; 5Erasmus Medical Center, Pediatric Surgery, Rotterdam, The Netherlands; 6University Medical Center, Pediatric Surgery, Groningen, The Netherlands; 7Leiden University, Mathematical Institute, Leiden, The Netherlands; 8Radboud University Medical Center, Pediatric Surgery, Nijmegen, The Netherlands Background/Objectives: Establishing surgery related complications, mortality and longterm sequelae in a large cohort of patients with neuroblastoma (NBL). Evaluating impact of extent of resection on survival and local recurrence in highrisk patients. Design/Methods: This retrospective multicenter cohort study included all patients who underwent primary tumor resection for NBL in The Netherlands between 1998 and 2014, before the start of centralized care. Surgery related complications, mortality and longterm sequelae were documented. For all highrisk patients, fiveyear overall survival (OS), fiveyear event free survival (EFS), fiveyear cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) and total number of local recurrence (NLR) were estimated for complete, >95% and 95% resection. Results: Surgery was performed in 301 children. Peroperative complication rate was 42%. Shortterm postoperative complication rate was 43%. PICU support for surgical complications was necessary in 5%. Secondary surgery was performed in 8%. Five children (2%) died of surgery related causes. Longterm complications occurred in 9% of children, longterm sequelae in 6%. A total of 170 children (57%) were stratified as highrisk patients. For complete resection, EFS was 25% 6 (20%). Conclusions: A large series of surgery related adverse events in children treated for Neuroblastoma is presented. Surgery for neuroblastoma is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. For highrisk patients, no significant difference was found in overall survival, event free survival, cumulative incidence of relapse or total number of local recurrence for complete, >95% or 95% resection. O-149 Surgical Complications of Kidney and Urinary Tract in Abdominal Neuroblastoma A Retrospective SingleInstitutional Review of 521 Cases in 5 Years H. Wang 1 1Beijing Children's Hospital Capital Medical University, Surgical Oncology, BEIJING, China Background/Objectives: Gross total resection(GTR) is survivalbeneficial even for advanced neuroblastoma. Although it is still controversial and may be relevant to higher rate of complications, GTR has been the goal of surgery for most cases. So it is important to know better about the possible complication, particularly the injury of kidney and urinary tract which is the most common in abdominal neuroblastoma. Design/Methods: 521 consecutive patients who underwent primary tumor resection enrolled hospitalization in our hospital from January 2011 to January 2015. By reviewing the medical records and followup data, 66 cases was identified to have kidney and urinary tract injury. Results: Of the 66 cases, patients aged from 6 months to 8 years. The INSS staging were 3 and 4. All the patients accepted preoperative chemotherapy. 10 cases underwent intraoperative nephrectomy and seminephrectomy, 3 due to renal vascular encasement and 7 due to invasion to parenchyma. Nephrectomy were planed before operation. 21 cases were found in the followingup to have ischemia and kidney atrophy. 7 of the 21 cases showed renal atrophy in three months postoperation, and the other 14 cases showed different amount of ischemia in the affected kidney. 27 cases showed hydronephrosis and dilation of ureter with normal renal function. 9 cases were found to have some minimal abnormalities, 2 with dislocation of kidney, 2 with renal caculus and calc deposition, 5 with outline of kidney undistinguished by adhesion. 2 cases underwent renal arterial reconstrution intraoperately because of severe injury of the artery and ischemia of the kiney. One showed normal blood supply to the kidney and the other with renal atrophy in the followingup. Conclusions: Surgical complications of kidney and urinary tract are common. The continual improvement of manipulation of surgery is important. Imaging indication helps to tailor the surgical strategy for neuroblastoma. O-150 Our Experience with Neuroblastoma in Children Outcomes Based on Risk Stratification S. Mishra 1, S. Jain2, G. Kapoor3 1Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Research Centre, Pediatric Surgical Oncology, Delhi, India; 2Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Research Centre, Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Delhi, India; 3Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Research Centre, Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Delhi, India Background/Objectives: With few exceptions, the outcome of Neuroblastoma (NB) is dismal, especially in developing countries. The aim of this study was to analyze the overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) in Low, Intermediate and High risk groups of NB managed in our Institute in the last 7 years. Design/Methods: Retrospective analysis of hospital records of patients with NB was done from January 2009 to Dec 2016. In 57 patients with a median age of 3 yrs and M:F ratio of 1.19, primary Twentyfour came only for opinion and and 7 were lost to follow up after the 1st admission (including 3 patients who came only for surgery or radiation). Remaining 26 were further studied. Results: INRG risk stratification showed Low risk (n=11), Intermediate risk (n=3) and High risk (n=12). IDRF was present in 7 patients. Two neonates with Stage IVS succumbed early. The remaining 12 Low and Intermediate risk patients did well with a combination of chemotherapy and surgery or close observation alone. Surgery was done in 21/26 patients. Spontaneous regression was seen in 3/11 low risk patients. Of the high risk group 9/13 underwent autologous stem cell transplant and differentiating therapy of which 4 are alive and well. Anti GD2 therapy was not available. The 2yrDFS in Low intermediate and high risk group patients was 80%, 100% and 40% respectively. The 4yrDFS dropped to 20% in the high risk group as 3 patients did not have long term follow up. Conclusions: Despite tremendous challenges in resource challenged nations, treatment of NB is feasible in high volume Pediatric Oncology centres with facilities for autologous stem cell transplant. The results are comparable to that published in literature. O-151 Future Fertility: Giving Hope to Young People C. Elbourne 1, R. Parry2, J. Davies3, S. Lane4, K. Lakhoo1 Children's Hospital The John of Paediatric Surgery, Oxford, United Kingdom; 2The Children's Hospital The John Radcliffe Oxford, Department of Paediatric Surgery, Oxford, United Kingdom; 3The Children's Hospital The John Rafcliffe Oxford, Oxford Tissue Bank, Oxford, United Kingdom; 4The Children's Hospital The John Rafcliffe Oxford, Department of Paediatric Oncology, Oxford, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: Ten young people under the age of twentyfive are diagnosed with cancer every day. Eight will be cured but one will become infertile as a result of their treatment. Cryopreservation of gonadal tissue to preserve fertility and endogenous hormone production has been extremely successful and is available to increasing numbers of children. We aim to share our experience of this groundbreaking service. Design/Methods: Initially developed to provide women and girls with cancer the ability to preserve ovarian tissue while undergoing intensive treatment, the service has rapidly expanded incorporating testicular cryopreservation for prepubertal boys and inclusion of children with nonmalignant haematological conditions undergoing curative bone marrow transplantation. Referrals are received from across England and Wales and assessed by the specialist multidisciplinary team. Children and families receive preoperative counselling from a specialist paediatric consultant and surgical team. Where possible the retrieval of gonadal tissue, via testicular biopsy or laparoscopic unilateral oophorectomy, is performed concomitantly with other required procedures. Tissue is received directly from theatre and processed by the onsite tissue bank team. For most children, this is a day case procedure. Results: Since its beginning in 2013, 84 children have undergone gonadal tissue retrieval for cryopreservation. Testicular biopsy has been performed for 15 prepubertal boys. Unilateral laparoscopic oophorectomy has been performed for 69 girls ages 117. Of these, 28 have undergone concurrent procedures including central venous line insertion, lymph node biopsy and bone marrow aspiration. 53 were girls with cancer and 16 had nonmalignant haematological disease including 8 girls with sickle cell anaemia and 4 with thalassaemia. The service has grown tenfold between 20132016, and continues to expand. Conclusions: Laparoscopic oophorectomy and testicular biopsy facilitating gonadal tissue cryopreservation is a safe and effective service providing hope for children and their families undergoing treatment for cancer and nonmalignant haematological disease. O-152 Laparoscopic Ovarian Cortical Strip Harvesting for D. Baker 1, C. Clark1, F. Munro1, P. Hammond1, H. Wallace2, R. Anderson3 1Royal for Sick Children, Paediatric Surgery, Edinburgh, United Kingdom; 2Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Paediatric Oncology, Edinburgh, United Kingdom; 3Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, Reproductive Medicine, Edinburgh, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: Advances in the treatment of childhood cancers show ever improving survival rates. The treatment of childhood malignancy can however lead to premature gonadal failure. We present our centre's experience of using cortical strip harvesting for ovarian tissue cryopreservation while retaining the remainder of the ovary in situ. Design/Methods: In this paper we describe the surgical technique and perioperative care regimen. We detail the demographic data for 24 cases over a ten year period and review complications. We discuss outcomes, and the method of cryopreservation used for the ovarian tissue. Results: Thirty patients were identified between 2006 and 2016 who have undergone laparoscopic ovarian cortical strip harvesting, of which followup data was available for 24. Median age at operation was 13, range 416. There was no significant bleeding, adhesional obstruction, or injury to other organs reported. No cases were converted to open procedures or returned to theatre. Early postoperative pain has been found to be a feature, thought to be secondary to gonadal trauma. Five patients have since died as a result of their underlying diagnosis. Three have menstruation documented at followup. To date, two patients are known to have fallen pregnant naturally since their surgery, and one of these pregnancies progressed to childbirth. Conclusions: Laparoscopic ovarysparing ovarian cortical strip harvesting is a safe procedure, although it should only be performed as part of an integrated service with fertility and laboratory specialists with suitable accreditation and oversight. It offers the possibility of conceiving naturally or via reimplantation to patients who are at risk of early infertility as a result of their treatment. Session 2: Renal Tumours & Lung Metastasis O-153 Surgery of Bilateral Renal Tumors in Children Involving the Renal Hilus S.W. Warmann 1, Background/Objectives: Bilateral nephronsparing surgery (NSS) is the surgical approach of choice in bilateral renal tumors in children. However, centrally located tumors with involvement of the renal hilus represent a surgical challenge. Design/Methods: We evaluated all children with bilateral renal tumors involving he renal hilus operated on at our center, which serves as surgical reference center for pediatric renal tumors. Results: Fifteen children were evaluated (8 girls, 7 boys) with a median age of 32 months (1367). All children had undergone neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Median operating time was 359 minutes (90383). We performed bilateral NSS in 10 cases, unilateral NSS in 3 children with single kidneys after contralateral tumor nephrectomy elsewhere, and unilateral NSS with contralateral tumor nephrectomy in 2 children. The reasons for the two nephrectomies were loss of function after NSS prior to referral in one case and cava thrombosis plus extrarenal disease in the other case. In all but one of the patients undergoing bilateral surgery we performed a single stage approach. Median vascular exclusion time in patients with hilus involvement was 19 minutes (545). 2 children required redosurgery for urinary leakage. Histology revealed intermediate risk in 8 patients, high risk in 4 patients and nephroblastomatosis in 3 patients. One child with high risk nephroblastoma (blastemal type with diffuse anaplasia, cava thrombus and extrarenal disease) had a combined pulmonal and abdominal relapse and died 16 months after surgery. All other patients are alive without evidence of disease and with their organs functioning after a median followup of 25 months (0118). Conclusions: Children with bilateral renal tumors should be treated and especially undergo surgery in centers with special expertise in this field. Under this condition, surgery of central bilateral renal tumors can be executed with a satisfactory surgical, functional, and oncological outcome. O-154 Feasibility of Complete Resection of Residual Lung Nodules After Chemotherapy in Patients with Stage IV Favorable Histology Wilms Tumor P. Ehrlich 1, E. Smith2, J. 1University Michigan, Surgery, Ann USA; 2University of Michigan, radiology, Ann Arbor, USA; St Louis, Radiology, Lous, USA; 4University of Washington, Surgery, Seattle, USA; University, USA; 6Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia, Radiology, Philadelphia, USA; 7Primary Surgery, Salt Lake 8Cohen Childrens Hopsital, Surgery, Long island, USA; 9Cincinnati Cincinnati, 10Dana Onoclogy, Washington DC, British Columbia, Oncology, Vancouver, Canada Background/Objectives: Children's Oncology Group (COG) study AREN0533 showed that patients whose pulmonary lesions had a complete response (CR) by 6 weeks with vincristine, dactinomycin, and doxorubicin can avoid pulmonary XRT and have outstanding overall survival. Patients who did not achieve CR received pulmonary XRT, but it is possible that some of these patients had benign lesions, necrotic Wilms tumor, or welldifferentiated Wilms tumor that may not require XRT. The purpose of this exploratory study was to examine the feasibility and extent of surgical resection for PR/SD patients enrolled on AREN0533. Design/Methods: Patients enrolled on COG AREN0533 with stage IV WT due to pulmonary metastasis, and had either PR/SD with less than 10 lesions after 6 weeks of chemotherapy were eligible. The initial and 6 week chest CT were reviewed by surgeons and radiologists to evaluate number, location and resectability of residual lesions. For this study resection was considered \"feasible\" if lesions were peripheral, required only a wedge resection and could be performed thorascopically. Resections that would require a total lobectomy were not considered feasible. Results: 302 patients enrolled and at 6weeks, 189 had either PR/SD. Of these 93(49%) had less than 10 lesions (14 SD and 79 PR). 83 of 93 patients has 13 residual lesions. In 23/93(28%) surgery was considered not feasible. In 67/93 (72%) thorascopic surgery was deemed feasible(35% of total, 67/189). Extent of surgery included a single wedge resection in 20 patients; between 23 wedge sections in a single lobe in 5 patients; between 23 wedge resections in different lobes in a single lung in 24 patients. 18 would require 25 wedge resections in both lungs Conclusions: Thorascopic resection of pulmonary noldues was considered \"feasible\" in PD/SD after 6 weeks of cheotherapy. Selected PR/SD patient's maybe good candidates for surgery and could avoid XRT. O-155 CrossSectional and Longitudinal Study of Renal Function after NephronSparing Surgery Versus Nephrectomy for Unilateral Renal Tumor in Children D. Cozzi 1, S. Ceccanti1, S. frediani1, I. Falconi1, A. Cervellone1, F. Cozzi1 1Sapienza University of Rome, Pediatric Surgery Unit, Rome, Italy Background/Objectives: Preoperative renal dysfunction in children with unilateral renal tumor (URT) may be a surrogate marker of low nephrons number endowment. Therefore, we included baseline renal function among the matching criteria used to compare the renal function outcome after nephronsparing surgery (NSS) versus nephrectomy in more balanced pairmatched groups of children with URT. Design/Methods: We reviewed our prospectively maintained database of children with URT treated at our institution between 1992 and 2016. Thirteen patients who underwent NSS were matched with thirteen patients who underwent nephrectomy. Propensity scores included age at surgery,stage, age at followup, sex, histologic type, preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and number of preoperative patients with renal dysfunction (eGFR<90/ml/min/1.73m2). The renal function outcomes were evaluated by crosssectional and longitudinal study of eGFR. Results: Before surgery 5 patients in each group presented with renal dysfunction. At 20year followup, crosssectional study showed a renal function advantage of NSS over nephrectomy (eGFR 117\u00b118.4 vs. 99.5 \u00b122.1;p=0.03). The longitudinal study of eGFR showed a stable renal function after nephrectomy (p=0.64) and a significant increase after NSS (p=0.004). At last followup, 6 patients after nephrectomy and none after NSS, presented with a renal dysfunction (p=0.01). Conclusions: Children with URT treated with NSS, in comparison with pairmatched children treated with nephrectomy, may present after surgery a better recovery of renal function reaching at longterm followup values within the range of two kidneys renal function. At a similar followup, 46% of children with URT treated with nephrectomy may present with renal dysfunction. O-156 How do we Biopsy Renal Tumours? K. Elmalik 1, Gavens2, Cancer Service, Paediatric Surgery, Nottingham, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: The management of Wilms tumour is unique in the UK. The SIOP protocol is followed however currently a biopsy is performed prechemotherapy. The UKW3 team have investigated the potential influence of the biopsy on local recurrence. The aim of this study was to examine the technique of the biopsy. Design/Methods: This was a three centre retrospective data analysis between 20012016 using medical records and Histopathology reports from three centres. Study limitations were due to variability in documentation within the three sites over a long period of time. Results: Hundred and forty cases of renal tumours were identified, 76 were females and 64 were males; average age was 3y 4m (5m stage2 13%, stage 3 24%, stage 4 22% and stage 5 7%. Risk stratification showed 11% were high risk, 82% intermediate and 7% low risk. The approach to biopsy was open in 7% and percutaneous in 93%. In nine percutaneous cases a Coaxial sheath was used. The needle gauge range was 14 to 18G. The radiologist performed the biopsy in 44% of cases while the surgeon did in 56%. Multiple cores were taken between 211 samples. Ultrasound guidance was utilised in the majority to guide the biopsy. Only one patient developed bleeding from a biopsy however none underwent an emergency nephrectomy. Conclusions: This is the first study that looked into the technique of biopsy in renal tumours. The results showed that the technique is safe whether it is performed by a radiologist or a surgeon. Surgeons and radiologists need to improve their documentation of the fine details when performing percutaneous biopsies. O-157 InterEthnic Differences in Wilms Tumors A Clinical, Pathological and Faculty of Science, Singapore, Singapore; 2KK Women's and Children's Hospital, Service, Singapore, Singapore; 3KK Women's and Children's Hospital, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Singapore, Singapore; 4KK Women's and Children's Hospital, VIVAKKH Paediatric Solid Tumour Research Laboratory, Singapore, Singapore; 5National University of Singapore, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, Singapore, Singapore; 6KK Women's and Children's Hospital, Department of Paediatric Surgery, Singapore, Singapore; 7National Cancer Centre Singapore, Division of Radiation Oncology, Singapore, Singapore Background/Objectives: Wilms tumor demonstrates significant epidemiological, histological and outcome differences between ethnic groups, yet the clinicopathological and molecular profile is poorly studied in Asians. Also, the incidence of biological risk factors in Asian populations are not known. We aimed to characterize these features in Wilms tumor patients from a multiracial cohort. Design/Methods: Clinical charts and histological slides from patients with malignant renal tumors seen at our institution from January 1997 to December 2016 were reviewed. PCRbased genotyping was used to identify loss of heterozygosity at 1p36 and 16q22. Clinicopathological and molecular characteristics, and survival outcomes of Asian and nonAsian patients were compared. Results: Sixtyseven of 80 malignant renal tumors were Wilms tumors; 53 (79.1%) were Asian and 14 (20.9%) were nonAsians. Mean age at diagnosis was 4.1 years (s.d.: 3.4 years). There were more girls among nonAsians than Asians (female:male=1.8 and 1.0, respectively). Unfavorable histology occurred more frequently in nonAsians than Asians (25.0% and 4.2%, respectively, P=0.02). More nonAsians had focal or diffuse anaplasia and compared to Asians (2.2% and 2.2%, P=0.059), yet nephrogenic rests were encountered only in Asian patients (7 perilobar, 6 intralobar). More nonAsians presented with advanced disease (National Wilms Tumor Study (NWTS) stage III, 6 (54.5%), stage IV, 3 (27.3%)) compared to Asians (stage III, 13 (27.1%), stage IV, 5 (10.4%)), but lymph node metastases rates were similar (nonAsian 20.0%, Asian 19.1%). No Asian patients had bilateral tumors; only one nonAsian patient had stage V disease. Following treatment on NWTS regimens, eventfree and overall survival did not differ between nonAsian and Asian patients (P=0.660 and 0.782, respectively, Logrank test). Conclusions: Asian patients had more equal gender ratio, less unfavorable histology and anaplasia, and less advanced disease at presentation. The biological bases for these differences, and the potential implications on treatment recommendations for Asian patients warrants further study. O-158 Combination Technique Image Guided Localisation Prior to Thoracoscopy Facilitates Accurate Identification and Biopsy of Suspiscious Pulmonary Lesions M. Collin Children's Cancer Research Unit, Sydney, Australia Background/Objectives: Image guided localization of pulmonary lesions suspected for metastases or infection prior to thoracoscopic biopsy has aided identification during the minimally invasive approach. Techniques used to facilitate identification of the lesions at thoracoscopy have included methylene blue tattoo or hookwire localisation under CT guidance. We describe our surgical results using the techniques alone or in combination to improve the intra operative localisation of the lesions at thoracoscopy. Design/Methods: This retrospective audit included all cases of CT guided localisation and surgical excision of pulmonary lesions identified from our institution's surgical and radiology databases from 20062016. We reviewed the method of CT localisation (single hookwire or methylene blue versus both), the intraoperative findings including success of the technique, ability to identify the lesion and histopathological findings. Results: Eighteen children (14 male and 4 female, age range 417 years) underwent CT guided localization prior to surgical excision of pulmonary lesions. Eleven out of 18 cases involved the use of both hookwire and methylene blue, 6/18 cases used methylene blue only and 1/18 case used hook wire only. Histologically, there were 5 metastatic nodules, 1 fungal infection, the remaining 11 being nonspecific/infective changes or lymph nodes. Thoracoscopic resection of the suspicious lesion was possible in all except one case where methylene blue only was used and spilt throughout the thorax. In this case a previously unidentified pleural based lesion was biopsied which was diagnostic for infection. In two cases where both techniques were used, one of the techniques had failed (one hookwire and one methylene blue) however the lesions were successfully biopsied due to localization from the other technique. Conclusions: Preoperative image guided localisation of pulmonary lesions facilitates minimally invasive thoracoscopic identification for biopsy of these lesions. We recommend the use of both hookwire and tattoo to improve the chances of localising a lesion accurately for biopsy. O-159 Prognostic Impact of Pulmonary Nodules Diagnosed at Initial Presentation in Patients with Osteosarcoma S. Irtan 1, L. Brugi\u00e8res2, H. Pacquement3, Paris, France Background/Objectives: Patients with metastatic osteosarcoma have a poor outcome but the surgical removal of all lung metastases is thought to improve survival. The dramatic increase of CTscan quality allows detecting endless smaller nodules whose exact nature remains difficult to assess. We aimed to determine if the presence of at least one nodule on CTscan at diagnosis has an impact on survival and to describe the evolution and management of lung nodules during the course of treatment. Design/Methods: The analysis was performed on patients from three centres included in OS2006 trial and treated with highdose methotrexate based chemotherapy from 2007 to 2013. Chest CTscans performed at diagnosis, before and after lung surgery, at the end of treatment and at relapse in case of recurrence were centrally reviewed. Results: Among 80 patients diagnosed at a median age of 13.5 years [327], 8 patients (10%) had been classified at diagnosis as metastatic, 46 (57%) as localized and doubtful in 26 cases (32%). At central review, nodules were found at diagnosis in 46 (57%) patients: in all patients classified as metastatic or doubtful and in 12 patients considered localized. The median number of nodules per patient was 2 [152]. Median size was 3 mm [113]. Nodules were round in 77% of cases and calcified in 17%. At preoperative assessment, nodules were still detectable in 30/46 (65%) patients with nodules at diagnosis and appeared in one patient with no nodules at diagnosis. Among these 30 patients, 22 (73%) were operated on. The 5year overall and eventfree survival (OS/EFS) of patients with at least one nodule at diagnosis versus no nodule were respectively 70%(95%CI:50%84%)/55%(CI95%:35%71%) and 89%(95%CI:70%96%)/79% (95%CI:61%89%) (p=0.04 for OS and p=0.15 for EFS). Conclusions: The CTscan detection of lung nodules at diagnosis of osteosarcoma regardless of their evolution and management seems to negatively impact OS. (PBCSession): The Robert Arceci Best of IPSO O-160 Outcome of Patients Suffering from Rhabdomyosarcoma of the Female Genital Tract A Report from the Cooperative Weichteilsarkom Studiengruppe Trials CWS81, 86, 91, and 2002P G. SparberSauer3, J. Fuchs4, T. Klingebiel5, E. Koscielniak3 1Center for Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, Department of Pediatric Surgery, Marburg, Germany; 2Center for Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, Department of General Pediatrics and Neonatology, Marburg, Germany; 3Klinikum Stuttgart Urology, 5University Hospital, Frankfurt/Main, Germany Background/Objectives: Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) of the female genital tract is rare and vaginal tumors seem to have a more favorable prognosis. Local control may consist of surgery and/or radiotherapy, but might be associated with severe side effects in young children. The aim of the study was to evaluate treatment and outcome of patients treated within four Cooperative Soft Tissue Sarcoma (CWS) trials. Design/Methods: Fiftyfour patients suffering from localized RMS of the female genital tract (vagina/uterus) were enrolled and analyzed. All patients were treated according to the CWS study protocols. Results: The 5year overall survival rate was 84.6% and the 5year event free suvival (EFS) 71.5%. Median age was 2.5 years and the median followup 7.85 years. 53 patients had embryonal and one patients alveolar histology. Forty patients were 10 (EFS: 71.4%) and fourteen >10 years (EFS: located at the (EFS: and 14 at the uterus (EFS: 78.6%). Tumors 5cm had a better EFS (n = 26; 84.3%) than those >5cm (n = 28; 59.3%). Positive lymph nodes at diagnosis were detected in 3 patients (EFS: 33.3%). Primary resection was carried out in 26 patients (EFS: 68%) and secondary resection in 33 patients (EFS: 65.3%). Completeness of resection did not influence the outcome. Radiotherapy was used in 20 patients (EFS: 42.1%). Only 3 patients were treated with solely chemotherapy. Conclusions: The outcome of patients suffering from RMS of the female genital tract is comparable to other localizations in the urogenital tract. Almost all patients had local control and tumors located at the uterus seem to have a trend towards a better EFS than those located in the vagina. Tumor size, but not patient\u00b4s age, is a positive predictive factor for outcome. The extent of surgical resection had no Impact on the outcome. O-161 Pelvic Peritonectomy Prevents Recurrence of Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumor After CRS and HIPEC A. HayesJordan 1, B. Coakley1, L. Xiao2, C. Herzog3, P. Anderson4, W. Huh3 1MD Anderson Cancer Center, Surgery, Houston Texas, USA; 2MD Anderson Cancer Center, Biostatistics, Houston Texas, USA; 3MD Anderson Cancer Center, Pediatrics, Houston Texas, USA; 4The Cleveland Clinic, Pediatric Hematology Oncolgy and Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Cleveland OH, USA Background/Objectives: Desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT) is a rare form of sarcoma primarily affecting adolescents. Patients frequently present with hundreds of peritoneal tumor implants. Historically, only 30% of patients reach 3year overall survival. Inability to obtain a complete abdominal resection impacts longterm survival in DSRCT. We use a combination of systemic chemotherapy, cytoreductive surgery with cisplatinbased hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRSHIPEC) and adjuvant radiotherapy. As almost 100% of patients have pelvic tumors at diagnosis, we hypothesized that a pelvic peritonectomy, after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, was essential for control of the 'primary' tumor. Design/Methods: We reviewed 81 patients who underwent complete CRSHIPEC with cisplatin for DSRCT from 20062016. Since pelvic peritonectomy was routinely performed after March 2013, we compared patients who received pelvic peritonectomy to those who did not, regardless of macroscopically visible disease in the pelvis. All patients received neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy. Most received adjuvant radiotherapy. Results: Patients ranged in age from 4 to 41 years and were followed postoperatively up to 7.7 years. Before pelvic peritonectomy was added to our standard operative approach, 39% of patients (18/46) developed a local recurrence. Of these recurrences, 33% (6/18) were located in the pelvis alone without distant disease. The local recurrence rate decreased to 6% (2/35) after making this change. Among 59 patients with at least 36 months followup, the median recurrencefree survival was 11.8 months and median overall survival was 36.1 months. Median postoperative survival (31.1 months vs. 18.1 months, p=0.04) was significantly longer in patients who had a CR0/CR1 CRSHIPEC than for patients who had a CR2 CRSHIPEC. Conclusions: Complete cytoreduction, including routine pelvic peritonectomy, substantially reduces local recurrence rates of DSRCT. With this technique, a 94% local control rate was achieved in DSRCT patients who underwent CRSHIPEC. O-162 Outcome of Localized LiverBile Ducts Rhabdomyosarcoma According to Local Therapy. A Report from the European Soft Tissue Sarcoma Group (EPSSG) RMS 2005 Study F. Guerin 1, G. T.N. S. Background/Objectives: To evaluate the impact of local treatment therapy on outcome in patients with liverbile ducts rhabdomyosarcoma (BDRMS) Design/Methods: We analyzed the data of 28 patients (2 liver, 26 bile ducts) included in the RMS 2005 protocol until 2013. Delayed surgery and/or External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT) were performed after at least 4 courses of chemotherapy. Results: All but one patient had embryonal RMS, 13 had a tumour > 5cm, 5 were N1. Median age at diagnosis was 3 years (18 years). - Six patients (21%) had primary surgery (1 IRS I, 4 IRS II, 1 IRS III): ) consisting of bile duct excision (BDE), 1 with Whipple procedure. Four of them also received EBRT. All are in first complete remission (CR1) except one (IRS II, EBRT+, local relapse, death) - Five patients (18%) received EBRT alone (one local relapse, death). - Seventeen patients (61%) underwent secondary surgery (7 with additional EBRT): 7 BDE including 2 with Whipple procedure, 7 BDE + partial hepatectomy, and 3 partial hepatectomies. Four R1 patients underwent EBRT without recurrence. Among 3 R0 patients who received EBRT, one had a metastatic relapse and died. Ten R0 patients did not receive EBRT: 3 relapsed locally, 2 died and 1 is in CR2. In summary, local relapse occurred in 2 among 15 patients with EBRT and 3 among 12 without EBRT. At a median followup of 5 years (16 months10 years) 23 patients are alive, 22 in CR1. Five patients died (4 local, 1 metastatic relapse). 5years Conclusions: Local relapse in BDRMS is often fatal. This analysis did not show any difference in outcome between surgery alone and EBRT+/ surgery. However possible longterm sequelae of EBRT on hepatic pedicle could be balanced with the safety of BDE + Roux en Y loop. O-163 Surgical and Interventional Treatments for Ruptured Hepatic Tumors in Japanese Study Group Experiences E. Hiyama 1, T. Hishiki2, K. Hoshino2, A. Yokoi2, Surgery, Hiroshima, Japan; 2Japan Children's Cancer Group, Liver tumor committee, Tokyo, Japan Background/Objectives: We aimed to evaluate interventional and surgical treatments of spontaneous tumor rupture in hepatic tumors in the JPLT (Japanese study group for Pediatric Liver Tumors) 2 study (19992012). Design/Methods: Of the 404 patients with hepatic malignancies who were enrolled in the JPLT2 study, 32 showed spontaneous tumor rupture at diagnosis. Age at diagnosis, sex, pathology of liver disease, PRETEXT classification, and clinical presentation were assessed. Embolization was performed in a selective fashion when possible. Treatments, complications, and survival were examined. Results: There were 7 PRETEXT I, 9 II, 10 III, and 6 IV, including 5 metastatic tumors. The age range at diagnosis was 2184 months, with 20 males and 12 females. Histological examination revealed 27 hepatoblastomas, 4 hepatocellular carcinomas, and 1 sarcoma. Transarterial embolization was performed in 27 cases, whereas 4 of them showed uncontrollable bleeding, with 2 of these cases dying of massive bleeding. In the remaining 30 cases, 11 PRETEXT I and II cases underwent primary resection of the tumors, 11 cases had a tumor biopsy followed by preoperative chemotherapy, and 8 cases received chemotherapy without a tumor biopsy. In the 19 cases with preoperative chemotherapy, 4 died of tumor progression before surgery, while the remaining 15 cases underwent tumor resection including 4 who received a liver transplantation. Postoperative chemotherapy was performed in all 30 cases, including 2 of high dose chemotherapy. However, 11 of these 30 cases showed recurrence and 6 cases died. Conclusions: Spontaneous tumor rupture is an unfavorable prognostic factor for pediatric liver tumors. Adequate surgical or interventional treatments to control tumor bleeding and more aggressive chemotherapy might be necessary to improve the outcomes of these patients. Rare Tumors (+ 1 education) O-164 Systematic Review and MetaAnalysis of Appendiceal Carcinoid Tumours in I. Bisharat1, C. Sinha1 1St London, Paediatric Surgery, London, United Kingdom; 2St George's University of London, Pathology, London, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: To determine if more invasive procedures are necessary following incidental finding of an appendiceal carcinoid tumour after Cinahl and Cochrane database of systematic reviews were undertaken of the English language literature. The mesh terms used were Carcinoid or neuroendocrine, tumour or tumor, appendix or child or paediatric or paediatric. Of 369 articles found 37 met the inclusion criteria. Our hospital records and pathology database identified 11patients with confirmed histological diagnosis of appendicular carcinoids from January 1996 to December 2016. Results: A total of 958 cases were identified from the literature and our own experience. There were 566 females and 343 males giving us a ratio of 1.65:1. The frequency was 1 in 333.8 appendicectomies or 0.3% of appendicectomies. There was a twenty eightfold increase in risk of having a positive lymph node if tumour size was >2cm compared with the risk of having a positive lymph node if tumour size was 2cm. Of 189 patients that met the criteria for Right hemicolectomy (RHC) following appendicectomy, with a median followup of 3.4years (range 051years) no recurrence was noted in neither the 69 that had a secondary procedure nor the 120patients that were just observed. No mortality from carcinoid was noted in the 2 groups. No survival advantage was therefore conferred by another procedure. Mean followup was 58.6months (4.8yrs) with a range of 0396months (33yrs). Appendicectomy alone is adequate treatment for an appendicular carcinoid in children, irrespective of size, position, lymph node or mesenteric involvement unless there are positive margins. Postappendicectomy investigations not helpful and long followup unnecessary O-165 Controversies in Surgical Management of Melanoma in Pediatric Age M. Ilari 1, G. Torino1, Hospital, Pediatric Surgery, Roma, Italy Background/Objectives: Malignant melanoma (MM) in children is rare with an incidence of 0.7/million/year. The risk of melanoma development in large congenital nevi is widely accepted. Melanoma occurrence from intermediate congenital nevi has been reported. The purpose of this study is to discuss surgical indications of nevi and diagnosis and treatment of melanoma. Design/Methods: From 2003 to 2016 were retrospectively reviewed 145 children (aged 1 month to 14 years) underwent to surgical excision of 156 nevi. Indications for excision included clinical appearance, site of difficult monitoring or of exposure to frequent trauma. After diagnosis of MM, the patient was underwent to sentinel lymphnode biopsy (SLNB) for melanoma thickness of 1 mm associated to excision of tumor site (with 2 cm margins) and primary closure or skin graft. Results: In all cases, first surgical excision included 2 mm margins of normal skin around the lesion. MM was diagnosed in 5 patients. One infant was underwent to partial excision of large congenital nevus but at 23 months followup he was also submitted to excisional biopsy of an inguinal nodal mass resulting in metastatic melanoma and he died for cerebral metastasis. The other 4 patients were underwent to scar excision with 2 cm margins and SLNB for MM diagnosis. In 3 patients, the SLBN was positive and in 2 of them was performed an inguinoiliacobturatory lymphnode dissection showed micromestases, on the contrary, in the third patient the parents refused further surgical proposed treatment but she remains disease free at 8 months followup. The remaining three patients are disease free at 16, 13 and 10 years respectively. Conclusions: MM in children is less rare than is commonly believed. The behaviour of this disease is different from that in adulthood. Clinical trials are needed to define the biological findings and the most suitable surgical treatment for MM in children. O-166 Outcome After Surgery for Solid Pseudopapillary Pancreatic Tumors in Children: Report from Trep Project - Italian Rare Tumors Study Group A. Crocoli 1, C. Grimaldi1, M.D. De Pasquale2, G. Cecchetto3, pseudopapillary pancreatic tumors (SPPT) are an extremely rare entity in pediatric patients. Even if the role of radical surgical resection as primary treatment is well established, data about follow up in children undergone pancreatic resection are scant. Design/Methods: Retrospective review of Italian pediatric rare tumor registry (TREP) was performed. Short (<30 days) and long term complications of different surgical resections, as well as long term follow up were evaluated. Results: from January 1st 2000 to February 28th 2017, 40 patients (M:F=8:32) were enrolled. Median age at diagnosis was 13,5 years (range 718). Median delay of diagnosis was 1 month (range 07). Fourteen children had an occasional diagnosis, whereas 19 complained of abdominal pain and 7 were referred for recurrent vomiting. Tumors arose from head of pancreas (n=12) or from body/tail (n=28). Resection was complete in n=3); 2 cases of microscopic spillage were recorded. At follow up (median 81 months, range 0188), local recurrence of disease occurred in one patient with intraoperative spillage. All patients are alive. Three pancreatic fistulas occurred in the body/tail group (conservative management), whereas 3 complications occurred in head group (one ileal ischemia undergone to endovascular treatment, one Wirsung duct stenosis undergone to surgical revision and one chilous fistula managed conservatively). Conclusions: Surgery proves as the therapeutic option for these tumors, hence complete resection is mandatory. Extensive resections, including duodenocephalopancreasectomy, are safe when performed in specialized centres. Long term follow up must be centered on oncologic radicality and residual pancreatic function. O-167 DuodenumPreserving Pancreatic Head (Modified Whipple's Procedure) for Tumors Localized to the Pancreatic Head in Children J. Wang 1, X. Chen1, M. Li1, J. Cai1, M. He1, J. Mao1, Q. Shu1 1Children's Hospital Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Department of Surgical Oncology, Hangzhou, China Background/Objectives: Pancreatic tumor is a rare neoplasm in children. Whipple's procedure is considered as a standard treatment for tumors localized to the pancreatic head. However, this radical procedure is still controversial in pediatric population, since most pancreatic tumors in children are benign or lowgrade malignant. Herein, we present 11 cases duodenumpreserving pancreatic head resection (DPPHR) for tumors localized to the pancreatic head in children. Design/Methods: Retrospective single institution study was performed, 11 cases with tumors localized to the pancreatic head in our center from Jan. 2015 to Dec. 2016 were included. Tumor types were pancreatoblastoma (n=4, 1 male and 3 female, aged from 3m to 7y2m) and solidpseudopapillary tumor (SPT, n=7, 2 male and 5 female, aged from 8y2m to 13y4m). All cases underwent DPPHR procedure. Patients with pancreatoblastoma and 3 cases with SPT received postoperative chemotherapy and other 4 cases with SPT received close followup without chemotherapy. Results: DPPHR was performed successfully and duodenum was kept intact in all cases. Eight cases underwent pancreaticojejunostomy only since common bile duct was not injured during pancreatic head resection. Two cases underwent pancreaticojejunostomy plus cholangiojejunostomy. Other 2 cases received tumor resection only. Pancreatic pseudocyst was observed in 1 case (tumor resection only group) and there was no other early postoperative complication. Followup time from 3m to 27m, recurrence was observed in 1 case with pancreatoblastoma 6m after chemotherapy. Recurrent tumor localized to pancreatic body not duodenum wall was identified during the second operation. Conclusions: Duodenumpreserving pancreatic head resection combined with appropriate chemotherapy is safe and effective for tumors localized to the pancreatic head in children. O-168 Diagnosis and Treatment of Pediatric Thyroid Cancer - Experience in 38 Cases at a FourthLevel Institution J.P. Luengas 1, C. Correa1, O. Cirug\u00eda Pedi\u00e1trica, bogota, Colombia Background/Objectives: To present our experience in the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric thyroid cancer at a Cancer Center in Bogota, Colombia. Design/Methods: We reviewed 48 cases referred to our institution from 20082016 with pediatric thyroid cancer. Thirtyeight had complete information on their charts for analysis. We analyzed the demographic characteristics, the symptom of presentation, diagnosis, treatment, recurrence, mortality, and delay between diagnosis and treatment. Results: Patients were between 819 years old. Mean age at diagnosis was 12 years of age. Eightytwo percent were female. Two patients had a positive family history for MEN2 Syndrome. 74% presented with a thyroid nodule, and 13% with cervical node. Fine needle aspiration biopsy was used for diagnosis in 71%. All patients underwent total thyroidectomy, papillary thyroid cancer was the most frequent histologic finding (87%), followed by medullary thyroid cancer (5%), clear cell and follicular carcinoma (3% each). Eightysix percent of patients had positive nodes and underwent cervical lymphadenectomy: 27% central compartment, and 73% central and modified radical lymphadenectomy. There was a complication rate of 13%, 26% recurrence, 29% metastasis, and 5% mortality in this series. Mean time between diagnosis and thyroidectomy was 4 months (range: 038), and mean time to iodine ablative therapy was 5 months (range: 036). Conclusions: Pediatric thyroid cancer is more frequent in adolescent females. It presents with a nodule or cervical node, and the most frequent histology is papillary carcinoma. Patients usually need some type of lymphadenectomy in addition to total thyroidectomy because of nodal disease. Mortality remains low even though many patients experienced a delay in surgical treatment and iodine ablative therapy due to healthcare issues. O-169 Cytoreductive Surgery and Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Perfusion with Chemotherapy in Children with Peritoneal Tumor Spreading: A French Nationwide Study Over 14 Years A. Scalabre1, P. PhilippeChomette2, G. Passot3, D. Orbach4, S. Sarnacki 13 Jacques H\u00f4pital Robert de France; Lyon Sud Hospices civils de Lyon University Oncology, Paris, Pediatric surgery, Paris, France Background/Objectives: Efficacy and role of cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic peritoneal perfusion with chemotherapy (HIPEC) remain unknown in pediatric tumors. Design/Methods: This retrospective multicentric national study analyzed all pediatric patients with peritoneal tumor spreading treated by cytoreductive surgery with HIPEC as part of a multimodal therapy in France from 2001 to 2015. Results: Twentytwo patients (9 males and 13 females) were selected. The median age was 14.8 years (4.217.6). Seven had peritoneal mesotheliomas, 7 desmoplastic small round cells tumors (DSRCT) and 8 other histologic types. Twenty (91%) patients received prior conventional chemotherapy before HIPEC. A complete macroscopic resection (CC0) was achieved in 16 cases (73 %). Incomplete resections were classified as CC1 in 4 cases (18%) and CC2 in 2 cases (9%). Fourteen (64%) patients had complications within 30 days from HIPEC, requiring an urgent laparotomy in 8 (36%) cases. Thirteen patients (59 %) received adjuvant chemotherapy and 4 (18%) received total abdominal radiotherapy after surgery. Fifteen patients (68%) had a relapse after a median time of 9.6 months (1.486.4) after the procedure and 9 (41%) eventually died after a median time of 5.3 months (0.136.1) from relapse. Six patients (27%) were alive with progressive disease at lastnews. Seven patients (32%) were alive and in complete remission after a median followup of 25.0 months. The mean overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) were 57.5 months (CI95% [38.5976.32]) and 30.9 months (CI95% [14.9646.77]). Patients with a peritoneal mesothelioma had a significantly better OS (p=0.015) and DFS (p=0.028) than other histologic type Conclusions: In this French national series, outcomes of HIPEC are encouraging essentially for the treatment of peritoneal mesothelioma in children. International randomized trials evaluating the outcomes of cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC for the treatment of peritoneal tumor spreading in children are mandatory. O-170 Minimally Invasive Surgery in Pediatric Surgical Oncology: A Developing Country Experience R.C. Ribeiro 1, V. Kremer1, W.E. Oliveira J\u00fanior1 1Barretos Childrens Cancer Hospital, Pediatric Surgery Department, Barretos, Brazil Background/Objectives: The use of Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) has been been greatly expanded in pediatric surgery. However its application in pediatric cancer still is a matter of debate. Our purpose is to describe our experience using Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) techniques in tertiary center with specific oncological pediatric surgery unit. Design/Methods: A retrospective analysis of all patients undergoing MIS in a pediatric oncology surgery unit at a single institution from a developing country between July 2014 and February 2017. MIS procedures were considered made by laparoscopy with diagnostic, staging or therapeutic intent. Demographic features, primary diagnosis, surgical procedure, time length, complications and conversion rate were reviewed. Results: Fortytwo children, ranging from 3 to 256 months of age, underwent 45 MIS procedures during this period. Laparoscopy was performed for tumor resection in 23 cases (51,1%), diagnostic purposes in 9 cases (20%), and for staging in 3 cases (6,6%). Ten additional laparoscopic procedures (22,2%) were performed for complications of the malignancy or its treatment. Median surgical time length was 73 minutes, ranging from 20 to 420 minutes, with a proctocolectomy as the longest procedure. In all cases safety principles of oncological surgery were respected. There was only one conversion to open surgery related to a bleeding during a resection of a mesenteric cyst. Complications were observed only in the proctocolectomy patients, presenting anastomotic fistulae in one patient and an episode of bowel obstruction in another. No trocar site recurrences were observed. Conclusions: The application of MIS techniques to pediatric cancer patients is a safe and effective diagnostic, staging and treating modality. MIS techniques are safe, reproducible and fulfill the objectives of quality of cancer surgery. Proper equipment remains as a limiting factor, along with the challenge in maintain a learning curve with a wide diversity of procedures. Liver Tumors, GCT and RMS (+ 1 education) O-171 Multidisciplinary Management of Hepatoblastoma: 8 Year Experience Fadel3,4, I. A. Younis1 Egypt, Pediatric Oncology Department, Cairo, Egypt; 4National Cancer Institute Cairo University, Pediatric Oncology Department, Cairo, Egypt; 5Children's Cancer Hospital 57357 Egypt, Radiology Department, Cairo, Egypt Background/Objectives: To evaluate the outcome of patients with hepatoblastoma treated by surgical resection at our hospital in 8 years. Design/Methods: Prospective study from January 2008 to December 2015. Evaluation was done by pretreatment extent staging system (PRETEXT), tumor biopsy and serum alpha fetoprotein. Overall survival (OS), event free survival (EFS) and univariate prognostic factors were estimated using kaplanmeier and log rank test. Recurrence or death was considered as event. Results: The study included 87 patients (52 males, 35 females). Median age at diagnosis was 1.05 years (0.5 - 12.86). There were 3 (3.4%), 62 (71.3%) and 22 (25.3%) PRETEXT I, II and III respectively. Sixty four patients (73.56%) were standard risk (SR) and 23 (26.44%) high risk (HR). Thirteen patients were metastatic at diagnosis (11 lung, 2 bone). Upfront resection was done in 5 patients (5.75%) whereas, the other 82 (94.25%) underwent surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy according to their risk stratification. Fifty two patients (59.77%) underwent hemihepatectomy (33 right, 19 left), 26 (29.88%) segmentectomy, 5 (5.75%) mesohepatectomy and 4 (4.6%) trisegmentectomy. Follow up till the end of June 2016 with a median of 23.5 months (6.46 - 100) revealed that 21 patients (24.1%) had events, among them 12 local recurrence, 7 distant relapse (6 lung, 1 brain) and 2 patients died postoperatively. The 5 years OS was 80.4% [85.3% Conclusions: Surgical resection combined with systemic chemotherapy is fundamental for improved outcome with 5 years OS and EFS 80.4% and 68.7% respectively. SIOPEL risk stratification and distant metastasis were independently impacted on the survival rates. O-172 Laparoscopic Liver Resections in Children with Liver Tumors P. Kerimov 1, A. Kazancev1, M. Rubanskaya1, D. Rybakova1 1Russian Cancer Research Center. NN Blokhina, Surgical separation of tumors of thoracoabdominal localization, Moscow, Russia Background/Objectives: Laparoscopic liver resections for tumor liver pathology in children have been used relatively recently. In the literature, there are very few reports of laparoscopic liver resections in children with tumor organ pathology. Design/Methods: In our clinic from 2007 to 2016, 20 patients aged 3 months to 16 years underwent radical laparoscopic resections of the liver. Boys 14, girls 6, the average age of patients was 4 years. The following pathologies are diagnosed: hepatoblastoma 14 cases, liver hyperplasia 4 cases, metastasis of neuroblastoma 1 case and hemangioma of the liver 1 case. Results: Hemihepatectomy was performed in 6 patients, 5 patients had a diagnosis of hepatoblastoma, in 1 child nodular hyperplasia. The average duration of operations was 90 minutes, the average blood loss was 120ml. No conversions. Staying in the intensive care and reanimation room was 3 days.Segmentation was performed in 14 patients, in 9 patients hepatoblastoma was detected, hyperplasia 3 cases, neuroblastoma 1 case of hemangioma in 1 case. The average duration of operations was 60 minutes, the average blood loss was 050 ml. No conversions. Staying in the intensive care unit and intensive care was 2 days. There were no immediate and remote postoperative complications. Among 15 patients with malignant liver diseases, there was no progression of the disease during the entire followup period. Median followup was 60 months. Conclusions: In the case of malignant pathology, strict selection of patients is required according to the indications, as well as compliance with all principles of \"open\" surgery and, first of all, radical intervention. Laparoscopic operations allow minimizing postoperative complications, shortening the course of the postoperative period, which in turn makes it possible to start a special antitumor treatment in the shortest possible time and positively influence the longterm results of therapy O-173 Current Surgical Intervention for Pediatric Giant Mediastinal Germ Cell Tumors S. Fumino 1, K. Sakai1, M. Higashi1, S. Aoi1, H. Hosoi4, T. Tajiri1 1Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Pediatric Surgery, Kyoto, Japan; 2Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Pediatric Cardiovascular Surgery, Kyoto, Japan; 3Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Thoracic Surgery, Kyoto, Japan; 4Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Pediatrics, Kyoto, Japan Background/Objectives: Giant mediastinal germ cell tumors (MGCTs) in children are rare tumor and often form large mass at diagnosis. Especially, malignant MGCTs invade surrounding vital tissues, then, they require a wellplanned advanced surgical approach. We retrospectively reviewed our surgical strategy for giant MGCT. Design/Methods: Five children with a median age of 5 years (range 115) with giant MGCT were treated in our institute from 2012 to 2016. The medical charts were retrospectively reviewed. Results: The initial diagnosis was made by tumor markers and image inspection in all cases. Benign teratomas (2 girls) were treated with upfront surgery, and malignant MGCT (3 boys) showed elevated alphafetoprotein and underwent radical tumorectomy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. After detailed 3DCT, radical tumor excision was performed supported by a skilled pediatric cardiovascular surgeon. The basic approach was as follows: under cardiopulmonary support (CPS) (or with CPS on standby), via median sternotomy, the pericardium and phrenic nerve were resected en bloc with the tumor, followed by diaphragmatic plication. Open biopsy was performed via lateral thoracotomy in 1 patient with malignancy, who showed dense adhesion and fistula formation in the lung at radical resection; lobectomy via hemiclamshell incision was required. Although major pericardial effusion, chylothorax requiring thoracoscopic repair, hoarseness, and pyothoraxchylothorax were noted, no deaths or severe sequelae occurred in this series. Conclusions: MGCTs could be initially diagnosed based on tumor markers and imaging findings. Therefore, open biopsy should be avoided because of severe adhesion at surgery. Preoperative 3DCT and CPS can ensure safety during advanced surgery. Wellfunctioned surgical team including not only pediatric surgeons but also pediatric cardiovascular surgeons and thoracic surgeons is required for successful treatment. O-174 Incidence, Treatment and Outcome of Recurrent (REC) Malignant Germ Cell Tumors (MGCT): A Single Institution Experience S. Agarwala 1, S. Bakhshi2, A. Dhua1, V. Bhatnagar1 1All Institute of Medical Sciences, Pediatric Surgery, Delhi, India; 2BRAIRCH All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Medical Oncology, Delhi, India; 3BRAIRCH All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Radiology, Delhi, India; 4All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Radiodiagnosis, Delhi, India; 5CN Center All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Cardiovascular and Thoracic surgery, Delhi, India Background/Objectives: To evaluate the incidence and the outcome of treatment of recurrent (REC) malignant germ cell tumors (MGCT). Design/Methods: Prospectively maintained data of patients of MGCT managed in the pediatric solid tumor clinic from June 1994 through December 2016 was analyzed to evaluate the incidence of recurrence. Outcome was evaluated in terms of 5year overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS). Results: Of the 152 MGCT cases (83 gonadal; 69 extragonadal)treated in this period, there were 49(32.2%) recurrences. 113 of 152(74.3%) were primarily treated by us and of these 18(15.9%) recurred. Thirtynine(25.7%) were referred to us after resection and of these 31(79.5%)were with recurrence. The incidence of recurrence was similar among gonadal(27/8332.5%) and extragonadal tumors(22/6931.9%). The incidence of recurrence was maximum for testicular and least among the ovarian tumorts(Testicular: 53.3%; Sacrococcygeal:41.7% and ovarian:7.9%). The 5year OS and RFS the 152 patients was 0.9(95CI 0.830.94) and 0.61(95CI 0.520.69). Among the 49 RECMGCT, 42(85.7%) were alive and 7(14.3%) had died giving a 5year OS of 0.75(95CI 0.510.89). However, of these 42 survivors only 21(50%) were DFS, while the remaining 21 had progressive disease at last followup and chose to discontinue treatment. The 5yr OS was 0.67 for extragonadal and 0.82 for gonadal recurrences (p=0.25). Of the 18 recurrences after primary treatment by us, 14 were alive (5yr OS 0.49) but only 3 were DFS. Among the 31 RECMGCT referred after surgery elsewhere, 28 were alive (5yr OS 0.89) and 18 achieved DFS. Conclusions: The incidence of RECMGCT was 32% and it was similar for gonadal and extragonadal tumors (32.5% vs 31.9%). Though the 5year OS for RECMGCT was 0.75, only 50% achieved DFS. The OS was better (0.89 vs 0.49) for patients who were operated elsewhere and came to us with recurrence (chemo na\u00efve patients) than our own patients (heavily pretreated). O-175 Methadone the Cytostatic and Pediatric Urology, Tuebingen, Germany; 2University Hospital, Germany Background/Objectives: Rhabdoid tumors (RTs) and Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) are aggressive pediatric malignancies. Both entities show an intrinsic refractoriness to standard chemotherapy in advanced tumor stages, which is associated with poor prognosis. Alternative therapeutic approaches and optimization of already established treatment protocols are urgently needed in these conditions. The opioid receptor (OPRM1) agonist D,LMethadone is frequently used for analgesia in oncological patients. Recently it has been proposed that D,LMethadone exert a role in influencing tumor cell growth and could be a promising candidate for optimization of already established treatments. So far there are no related data in pediatric solid tumors. Design/Methods: Effects of combined D,LMethadone and doxorubicin treatment on two rhabdomyosarcoma and two rhabdoid tumor cell lines were measured using the following outcome data: cell growth inhibition (MTTassay), doxorubicin uptake and efflux, apoptosis and reactive oxygen (ROS) production (flow cytometry), gene expression studies (realtime PCR), cell migration (wound healing assay) and apoptosis and expression of the OPRM1 receptor (Western Blot). Results: Exposure of doxorubicin significantly increased the OPRM1 expression, whereas D,LMethadone increased doxorubicin uptake and decreased doxorubicin efflux. Moreover, combined treatment with D,LMethadone and doxorubicin resulted in a suppressed tumor cell growth and enhanced apoptosis in all cell lines, which was mediated by increased generation of ROS and through downregulation of apoptosis proteins. Furthermore treatment with D,LMethadone and doxorubicin resulted in a significant decrease of migration in comparison to D,LMethadone or doxorubicin alone. Conclusions: In summary, this new and innovative therapeutic approach displayed a strong antitumor effect in rhabdomyosarcoma and rhabdoid tumor cell lines. The combination therapy of doxorubicin and D,LMethadone merits further investigation as an auspicious anticancer drug in RTs and RMS, especially when conventional treatment regimens show limited effects in the clinical setting. O-176 Development of a National CompetencyBased Board Certification in Pediatric Surgical Oncology, the ComingofAge of a Subspeciality. Is There Room for a Global Curriculum? P. Lezamadel Valle 1 1Hospital Infantil De Mexico Federico Gomez, SURGERY / SURGICAL ONCOLOGY SERVICE, Mexico City, Mexico Background/Objectives: The surgical treatment of complex pediatric oncology cases is often beyond the scope of expertise of general Pediatric Surgeons. To overcome this situation, formal training in Pediatric Surgical Oncology (PSO) has been established in several comprehensive cancer centers across various countries, but formal Assessment for Credentialing and Certification has not been established before. The goal of this paper is to present the process of developing the Competencybased Board Certifying Exam. Design/Methods: A Model of Clinical Practice in PSO was defined, stratifying which patients could be under the care of General Pediatric Surgeons and which ones should be referred to PSO specialists. The competencies for PSO fellows and specialists were identified and integrated in a profile, and a Certifying Process was planned, with the Mexican Board of Oncology and the National Committee for Specialty Boards. Results: A team of examiners was assembled, and Item banking was done in sufficient amount to have a 150 MCQ test, and clinical vignettes were designed for the oral exam. The blueprinting for both components of the examination was completed and pilot tested. The actual examination took place in a twoday session in Mexico City, Mexico, in February 2017. Psychometric analysis of the MCQ items was conducted and the passfail standard was established. Three examinees sat for this first iteration, 2/3 obtained a passing score. Conclusions: Where there is overlapping of competencies between two or more specialties, constructing a Clinical Model of Practice involving the stakeholders can avoid potential conflict. This model allowed us to clarify boundaries and develop the competencies and facilitated blueprinting. The performance of examinees was as expected.

Treatment and Care Nursing O-177 Key Worker Role in EndofLife Care: 'I'D Call it Knitting....Making Sure That The Five or Six Elements That We Needed, They Were Knitted Together... Coordinated' S. Aldiss 1, A. Martins2, F. Gibson1,3 1University of Surrey, School of Health Sciences Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, Guildford, United Kingdom; 2University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cancer Clinical Trials Unit, London, United Kingdom; 3Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust, Centre for Outcomes and Experience Research in Children's Health Illness and Disability, London, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: The delivery of end of life care requires a broad range of health and other care services, this may include hospitals, hospices, primary care and community professionals, ambulance services, dedicated palliative care teams, and other support providers. Essential to this delivery are good communication, care coordination, and effective networking: the specialist nurse key worker role has been identified to provide this service. The aim was to evaluate the role of the key worker in end of life care of children and young people with cancer from the perspective of parents and key workers. Design/Methods: In depth semistructured interviews with eight parents and fourteen key workers. Interview transcripts were analysed using framework analysis. Results: Four main themes were identified: coordination of care; continuity of care; positive relationships and communication. Key workers provided clinical, emotional, educational and practical support to families, through the coordination of care, their clinical experience and expertise and their relationships with families and other professionals. Having a key worker facilitated professionals and parents to get to know one another and become emotionally close. Positive relationships with key workers were built on trust and open and honest communication, through which parents were provided with individualised support and reassurance. This support and reassurance in conjunction with key workers' coordination of resources enabled parents and children to have the choice of where to receive their care. Support in the palliative phase has its own challenges: lack of out of hours palliative care available in the community, establishing complex palliative care packages in the home and providing effective bereavement support for families. Some key workers offered a 24 hour on call service for these families. Conclusions: Having a key worker facilitated individualised and coordinated care and support. The positive key workerparent relationship is central to the support given to and received by parents. O-178 Trajectories of ProcedureRelated Distress in Children with Cancer: Risk Factors and Impact of Persistent Distress on LongTerm Quality of Life J. Bai 1, F.W.K. Harper2,3, L. Penner2,3 1Emory University, NHW School of Nursing, Atlanta, USA; 2Wayne State University, School of Medicine, Detroit, USA; 3Wayne State University, Karmanos Cancer Institute, Detroit, USA Background/Objectives: Children with cancer undergo distressing treatmentrelated procedures such as port starts. Traumatic experiences with these procedures can result in negative healthcare outcomes in children with cancer. Limited data exist on the trajectories of distress over time and the impact of distress trajectories on children's quality of life (QOL) in cancer. This study aimed to characterize the longitudinal trajectories of distress in children with cancer and identify the risk factors of persistent distress and the relationships between distress trajectories and children's QOL. Design/Methods: Fortythree children with cancer were selected from a parent study (R01CA138981). These children underwent 23 continuous port start procedures. Child distress levels during these procedures were assessed by multiple raters using the Revised WongBaker Faces Scale (T1, T2 and T3). The assessed risk factors included: demographic and clinical variables at baseline (T0) and parent dispositional attributes (Empathic concern, depression, negative and positive emotions) at T0T3. Parents reported children's QOL using PedsQLTM Cancer Module at 3month and 9month the last procedure (T4 and T5). The groupbased trajectory modeling was used to identify the child distress clusters; the logistic regression analyzed the risk factors of the distress trajectory clusters; the MannWhitney U test was conducted to examine the associations between the distress trajectory groups and QOL. Results: The groupbased trajectory modeling found two distinct trajectory clusters of distress: low distress group (n=24) and persistent distress group (n=19). The logistic regression showed that parent negative emotions at T3 can predict a significantly higher distress level (Odds Ratio=1.2, p=0.046). The MannWhitney test showed that the persistent distress group had a lower procedural anxiety at T4 (p=0.004) and at T5 (p=0.005), but more T4 (p=0.023) and at T5 (p=0.042). Conclusions: Targeted interventions toward parents may help improve QOL for children with the persistent distress following painful procedures. O-179 Does Parent Distress = Child Distress in Pediatric Cancer? A Review of the Psychology, Stillwater, USA Background/Objectives: The burden and stress of pediatric cancer leaves both parents and children vulnerable to psychological distress (e.g., depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress). Extant research suggests that a relationship exists between parental distress and child distress, such that parents who are more distressed tend to have children who are more distressed. Although Drotar (1997) reviewed this relationship, the studies reviewed may no longer be considered contemporary. The aim of this project is to provide a current and comprehensive review of literature on this important relationship. Design/Methods: A review of published pediatric psychooncology literature was conducted via PsychInfo and PubMed. Articles were chosen for review if they examined both parent and child distress, were available in English, and were peerreviewed. Results: Fortyone articles were identified as meeting inclusion criteria, of which 26 articles reported a significant positive relationship between parent distress and child distress, 5 articles reported that no relationship existed between parent and child distress, and 10 articles did not report an assessment of the relationship between parent and child distress. Articles that supported the existence of a relationship had sample sizes ranging from N=22N=309, utilized both crosssectional (n=22) and longitudinal (n=4) designs, and reported modest correlational coefficients (r=.10.60). Conclusions: Available research indicates that there is indeed a relationship between parent psychological distress and child psychological distress. Although it is unclear whether the relationship is directional or transactional in nature, findings are consistent with transactional stress and coping models of adjustment to chronic health conditions. Although metaanalyses of parenttargeted interventions have not shown consistent reduction of subsequent child distress (e.g., Pai et al., 2006), this review suggests that parenttargeted interventions may be capable of reducing child distress. However, given that not all studies reported analyses on this relationship, findings may be incomplete. Further research is needed to assess the mechanisms through which this relationship exists. O-180 High Levels of Intensity of Moral Distress among Healthcare Professionals- A National Study in Pediatric Oncology C. Bartholdson 1 1Karolinska Institutet, Women and Children\u00b4s Health, Stockholm, Sweden Background/Objectives: Caring for children with cancer involves complex decisions about life and death. Moral distress occurs when one has an idea of what is ethically correct but cannot act accordingly, as well as when one does not know what is ethically correct but has to make a decision. Studies of moral distress in pediatrics are rare. The overall aim was to describe healthcare professional's experiences of moral distress in pediatric oncology in Sweden. Design/Methods: Data collection was performed by using a translated and culturally adapted paediatric version of the Moral Distress ScaleRevised (MDSR).The instrument contains statements about difficult ethical situations. Healthcare professionals from all pediatric cancer centers (n=6) in Sweden completed the questionnaire by rating both level of disturbance and frequency related to each statement. Total moral distress score was calculated by summing the composite scores (i.e. level of disturbance x frequency). Descriptive analysis of data was conducted using Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). Results: In total 279 participants answered the questionnaire (response rate > 80%). Nurses and nurseassistants reported similar level of disturbance (intensity) whereas physicians reported slightly lower scores; the mean value for all professional groups was notably high. Furthermore nurses stated higher frequencies of distressing events compared to physicians and nurseassistants; the mean value for all professional groups was at the lower end of the scale. Nurses also reported higher level of total moral distress scores compared to other professions. Conclusions: Ethically distressful situations disturbs healthcare professionals a lot in pediatric cancer care in Sweden, however the situations does not occur very often. Nurses seem to experience the situations more distressful than the others. By understanding the experiences related to moral distress, ethical support can be tailored to assist healthcare professionals. O-181 Children's Participation in Decisions, Discussions, and Actions in a Pediatric Oncology Setting in New Delhi, India: A Focused Ethnography J. Behan 1, A. S. Bakhshi2, B. Bhattacharjee2, Ingram School of Nursing, Montreal, Canada; 2Dr. B. R. A. Institute Rotary Cancer Hospital All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Department of Medical Oncology, New Delhi, India; 3Max Super Speciality Hospital, Paediatric Oncology, New Delhi, India Background/Objectives: A participatory approach was adopted to better understand children's actual and desired participation in decisions, discussions, and actions in a pediatric oncology setting in New Delhi, India. Nested within an emerging field of childhood ethics, this study was guided by a moral experience framework, which seeks to understand how children's values or beliefs are being realized, or not, in their everyday lives. Design/Methods: A focused ethnography was conducted in 3 pediatric oncology settings including private, public, and notforprofit hospitals. Over a 3month period, key informant interviews were conducted, followed by a series of participant observations and semistructured interviews with children with cancer, and retrieval of key documents. Data were consolidated between sources, opencoding was conducted within/between sources, emerging codes categorized, and themes comparatively analysed. Results: 7 key informants were consulted to share their understanding of the moral experience of children with cancer. Key text analysis informed the contextual descriptions of the settings. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 22 children, 11 of which were observed during their cancer care. Participants, with varying cancer diagnoses, ranged in age from 3 to 17 yearsold. A conceptualization of participation was developed based on how the children actually or desire to navigate their worlds within the pediatric oncology setting. Children verbally and nonnegativerbally expressed their preferences for participation and elicited various dimensions to decisionmaking, discussions, and actions. Children expressed varying views with regards to decisionmaking concerning their health, cancer treatment, assent, nutrition, and housing. Children's participation varied in discussions and involved asking questions, listening, body language/facial expressions, and speaking. Children's actions included developing an understanding of their illness, expressing likes/dislikes and desires, addressing problems, recollecting their experiences, receiving treatment, and engaging in teaching and play. Conclusions: Children actively participate in matters affecting them. An advanced understanding of their values and beliefs may enhance their clinical encounters. O-182 Intravenous Chemotherapy at Home: standard care?! Intravenous Chemotherapy at Home for Children with Cancer. A Pilot Study A. Beukhof 1, N. Kok1, M. van de Wetering1 1Emma Children's Hospital/Academic Medical Center, Pediatric Oncology, Amsterdam, The Netherlands Background/Objectives: The treatment of a child with leukemia currently takes place in the hospital, which means that the child has to come to the hospital daily or weekly for treatment for a period of at least 2 years. In January 2017, a pilotstudy was started in these children to receive intravenous chemotherapy at home, with the aim to give the chemotherapy safe and efficient at home and improve the quality of life for children and families. Design/Methods: Through a partnership between the Department of Pediatric Oncology at the Emma Children's Hospital in Amsterdam, 'Kinderthuiszorg' (Children's home care organization ) and 'Mediq Tefa' (specialist in medical devices) it's possible to give intravenous chemotherapy at home. We performed an explorative comparative study, using questionnaires about the social impact of the treatment and a shortened validated QualityOfLifelist. As a baseline the questionnaires were taken before the start of the pilot, and will be repeated after 6 weeks and at the end of the pilot (at 3 months). This pilot consisted of 30 parents and 10 children (>12 years) and took place from January 2017april 2017 Results: The baseline results showed that 100% of the children and 86.6% of the parents are enthusiastic when chemotherapy is given at home. When they will get treatment at home 90% of the children and 83.3% of the parents expected to plan their life better, only 30% of parents expected to take time off work and 83.3% expected that the child will not miss school. The results of the pilot will be presented at the SIOP 2017. Conclusions: Because of specialized nurse practitioners in pediatric oncology both in the hospital and at home the possibility is created to administer the chemotherapy for these children at home and we hope this will be standard of care in the future! O-183 Home Care Services for Sick Children: Health Care Professionals' Conceptions of Challenges and Facilitators C. Castor 1, I. Hallstr\u00f6m1, H. Hansson2, K. Landgren1 1Lund University, Department of Health Sciences, Lund, Sweden; 2Copenhagen University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Copenhagen, Denmark Background/Objectives: Families often prefer home care to hospital care and the number of home care services for children is increasing. The aim of this study was to explore healthcare professionals' conceptions of caring for sick children in home care services. Design/Methods: An inductive qualitative design was used. Seven focus group interviews with 36 healthcare professionals from multidisciplinary home care services were performed. Data was analysed stepwise using a phenomenographic analysis. Results: Three \"A challenging opportunity\", \"A child perspective\", \"Reorganise in accordance with new prerequisites\". Providing home care for children was a challenging but rewarding task for healthcare professionals used to care for adults conceived to evoke both professional and personal challenges such as feelings of inadequacy and fear, and professional growth such as increased competence and satisfaction. Conceptions of whether the home or the hospital was the best place for care differed. Adapting to the child's care was conceived as important. Cooperation with paediatric departments and a wellfunctioning teamwork were important organisational aspects. Conclusions: A sufficient number of referred children and enabling healthcare professionals to be part of the reorganising and implementation processes might facilitate the home care services for sick children. Enough time and good teamwork must be emphasised. Early referrals, continuous cooperation with paediatric clinics complemented with individualised support when a child is referred were prerequisites that make up for the low number of paediatric patients and facilitate confidence and competence. The study was funded by the Swedish Childhood Cancer Foundation and The Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare. O-184 How do Children with Cancer Experience the Needle Insertion Into Venous Access Port ? S.E. Egeland 1, H. Lie C2, E. Ruud1 1Oslo University 0027 Oslo Norway., Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology Unit of Paediatric and Adolescent Medicine., Oppeg\u00e5rd, Norway; 2University of Oslo, Oslo University Hospital 0027 Oslo Norway., Oslo, Norway Background/Objectives: Many children with cancer fear painful needlerelated procedures. VAP is commonly used during cancer treatment, yet little is known about how children experience VAP needle insertion procedures. Aim: The aims were to 1) explore levels of distress before and pain after the VAP needle insertion among young patients, and 2) to explore how patients' selfreport of distress and pain correlate with the proxyreports by parents and nurses. Design/Methods: The sample included 43 patients, aged116 years with cancer, treated at two Norwegian hospitals and who had VAP for 26 months. The patient (if old enough), parent and nurse performing the procedure completed a questionnaire before and after the procedure. The questionnaire consisted of three developmentallyappropriate 10point distress and pain scales (higher scores indicate greater distress/pain). Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and nonparametric correlations. Results: For the young children (15 years), the median distress score was 8 (range 09) and pain score was 4 (range 010). Median distress and pain scores for the schoolage children (612 years) were 3 (range 09) and 1 (range 010), and for the adolescents (age 1316) were 0 (range 06) and 1 (range 05) respectively. Ten children (23%) reported high distress and/or pain scores (710). The distress level did not correlate with the pain level for the patient's ratings (rho=0.19, p=0.286) or nurses ratings (rho=0.33, p=0.062), but did for the parent ratings (rho=0.42, p=0.015). Patients' ratings of distress and pain correlated with the proxy ratings of parents (rho=0.83, p<0.001 distress and pain associated with VAP needleinserting procedures were greater among the youngest children compared to the older children. However, clinicians should be aware of the great individual differences and offer a CVK that does not involve needle insertion to highly distressed children. O-185 AgeAppropriate Preparations for Children with Cancer Undergoing Radiothearpy A Feasibility Study J. Gardling 1, E. T\u00f6rnqvist1, M. Edwinson M\u00e5nsson1, I. Hallstr\u00f6m1 1Faculty of Medicine Lund university, Department of Health Sciences, Lund, Sweden Background/Objectives: Due to the need for complete immobility during radiotherapy children often require daily general anesthesia for several weeks. The aim of this study was to test ageappropriate information and preparation procedures for children with cancer undergoing radiotherapy for feasibility and effectiveness in terms of the need for general anesthesia and anxiety. Design/Methods: In a quasiexperimental controlled clinical trial, 17 children aged 3 to 18 years receiving ageappropriate preparation including seven parts were compared with 16 children in a control group receiving traditional care. Feasibility in terms of recruitment, compliance and acceptability was assessed. Effectiveness was assessed by the primary outcomes: number of children who underwent treatment without general anesthesia and their respective fractions. Validated instruments measured the children's anxiety and emotional behavior as secondary outcomes. Results: The preparation parts were delivered as intended without any additional staff and without dropouts in the intervention group and therefore found feasible and acceptable. Three children planned for general anesthesia in the intervention group completed their treatments including 73 fractions awake. Children receiving general anesthesia, regardless of group, showed significantly higher negative emotional behavior. No statistic significances were found concerning the number of children receiving general anesthesia or anxiety. Conclusions: Avoiding general anesthesia for children with cancer going through radiotherapy gives benefits in terms of fewer risks and restrictions in life for the child, fewer disturbances in daily life for the family and lower costs for health care. Giving children individualized preparation may decrease the need for general anesthesia during radiotherapy treatment. Acknowledgements: We would like to express our gratitude to the participating children and to the Swedish Childhood Cancer Foundation for funding. O-186 Effects of AgeAppropriate Preparations for Children with Cancer Undergoing Radiotherapy on Parents' and Family Functioning, Parents' Anxiety and Hospital Costs J. Gardling 1, M. Edwinson M\u00e5nsson1, E. T\u00f6rnqvist1, I. Hallstr\u00f6m1 1Faculty of Medicine Lund university, Department of Health Sciences, Lund, Sweden Background/Objectives: The aim was to explore if ageappropriate information and preparation procedures for children with cancer undergoing radiotherapy 1) decrease the impact on parents' and family functioning, parents' anxiety and 2) reduce hospital costs compared to traditional care. Design/Methods: The study was a part of a quasiexperimental controlled clinical trial consisting of a control group including 31 parents to 16 children receiving traditional care and an intervention group including 32 parents to 17 children receiving ageappropriate preparation including seven parts. Validated instruments measured the parents' and family functioning and parents\u00b4 anxiety. Hospital costs were calculated. Results: Parents in the intervention group showed statistic significantly better communication throughout their child's radiotherapy. At their child\u00b4s last fraction, parental social functioning showed to have improved with a statistical significance. Parents of children receiving general anesthesia, regardless of group, showed statistically significant higher levels of anxiety. Hospital costs were lower in the intervention group. Conclusions: If only few children are able to go through RT without GA it imply for the individual child fewer risks and restrictions. For the parents\u00b4 and family, the benefits are in terms of less impact on their functioning and less anxiety. For the hospital, it means lower costs and increased availability of anesthesia personnel, enabling to prioritize other areas of care. Acknowledgements: We would like to express our gratitude to the participating parents and to the Swedish Childhood Cancer Foundation for funding. O-187 Preparing Children for Blood Tests: Using ArtsBased Techniques in Creative Research and App Development F. Gibson 1, N. Oldrieve2, J. Bayliss3, S. Hall4, 1Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust and University of Surrey, Centre for Outcomes and Experience Research in children's Health Illness and Disability Orchid and School of health Sciences, London, United Kingdom; 2St Georges Hospital, Community Children's Nurse in Children's Services, London, United Kingdom; 3Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust, The Louis Dundas Centre Oncology Outreach and Palliative Care, London, United Kingdom; 4Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust, GOSH Arts, London, United Kingdom; 5Freelance Consultant, N/A, Melbourne, Australia; 6Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust, Charles West Division, London, United Kingdom; 7Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust, Centre for Outcomes and Experience Research in Children's Health Illness and Disability ORCHID, London, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: Blood tests can be distressing for children and prove detrimental to their psychological wellbeing with some developing needle phobia, or anticipatory/procedural distress. Preparation for blood taking at the onset of illness is therefore invaluable in minimising such distress. Design/Methods: Our aim was to develop a 'tool' to help prepare children for blood tests. This was a twophased study. A userexperience design, using creative arts/art making was utilized. In Phase 1, through a range of activities, children looked at the importance of blood within the body, and why we need to take blood. Participants made some blood of their own using some unconventional ingredients. They invented comical 'blood' characters and made lifesize maps of their own bodies. The 'BLOOD QUEST' game was subsequently developed. In Phase 2 we assessed its usefulness and effectiveness with a small group of children (and parents) with haematological disorders who were in/attending hospital. From this foundation work the 'app' prototype emerged. Results: Phase 1: 7 hospitalised children aged 412 participated in a range of creative activities, drawing on their own experience to help design what the 'BLOOD QUEST' game looked like. Phase 2: 15 children played the game prior to having blood taken and completed a questionnaire about its usefulness and effectiveness. Most children who tested the game found it fun and informative. Half reported that playing the game made them feel better about having their blood taken and half felt the same. The game was more suited to children aged 47. Conclusions: The collaboration between children and an illustrator enabled 'idea elaboration' allowing children to have genuine influence in research and in shaping the prototype game into the 'app'. This presentation will focus on the creative steps that resulted in the Blood Quest 'app', available for the ipad and now free to download from the Apple App Store. O-188 Multilingual Encounters in Paediatric Cancer Care - Risking Patient Safety by Insufficient use of Interpreters J. Granhagen Jungner 1, E. Tiselius2, K. Blomgren1, and children's health, Stockholm, Sweden; 2Stockholm University Institute for Interpreting and Translation Studies, Department of Swedish Language and Multilingualism, Stockholm, Sweden Background/Objectives: Overcoming language barriers in multilingual paediatric cancer care will improve the care situation and reduce costs, but knowledge is needed about how communication is performed and facilitated in situations with language barriers as well as how these situations can be improved. The purpose of this study was to investigate communication over language barriers between healthcare professionals (HCP) in paediatric cancer care and patients/families with limited proficiency in the country's official language. Design/Methods: We combine communication and interpreting sciences with medical and nursing sciences in an interdisciplinary project to increase knowledge about the complexity of communication over language barriers. A national multisite crosssectional survey has been performed using the Language Barriers and Communication Questionnaire (LBCQ). HCP (physicians, registered nurses, and nurse assistants) at all paediatric cancer centres (n=6) in Sweden were invited to participate and statistical analyses were performed using SPSS. Results: A total of 281 questionnaires have been collected (response rate > 80%). A majority of the respondents reported that the use of interpreters to a high degree increase patient safety (87%) and patient/parent participation in care (83%). Despite this, 50% of the respondents reported that they never or seldom use interpreters to take arrival status or medical history, and 48% report that they never or seldom use interpreters when they educate the patients and families. Conclusions: By identifying weaknesses in communication between HCP and patients/families with limited proficiency in the official language, we identified areas in this communication which needed to be strengthened. Results showed that HCP were aware that the use of interpreters increases patient safety and participation in paediatric cancer care. However, there is an insufficient use of interpreters, for example when taking arrival status and medical history or educating patients and the families, representing a risk to patient safety. O-189 Symptom Trajectories in Children Receiving Treatment for Leukemia: A Latent Class Growth Analysis with Multitrajectory Modeling M.C. 1, Minnesota, School of Nursing, Minneapolis, USA; 2Duke University, School of Nursing, Durham NC, of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, Houston TX, Arizona, School of Nursing, Tucson AZ, USA; 5Children's Minnesota, Cancer and Blood Disorders Program, Minneapolis MN, USA Background/Objectives: Cancer treatment symptoms play a major role in determining the health of children with cancer. Symptom toxicity often results in complications, treatment delays, and therapy dose reductions that can compromise leukemia therapy and jeopardize chances for longterm survival. Critical to understanding symptom experiences during treatment is the need for exploration of \"why\" interindividual symptom differences occur; this will determine who may be most susceptible to symptom toxicities. The objective of this study was to examine specific symptom trajectories during the first 18 months of childhood leukemia treatment. Design/Methods: A repeatedmeasures research design was used to evaluate treatmentrelated symptom associations experienced by patients, ages 3 to 18 years, receiving treatment for a new diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia at four sites. Symptom trajectories were explored over four time periods: initiation of postinduction therapy, 4, 8 and 12 months into postinduction therapy. Selfreport symptom measures included fatigue, sleep disturbances, pain, nausea, and depression. Parents of children ages 3 to 6 completed proxy measurements. Latent class growth analysis was used to classify patients into distinctive groups with similar symptom trajectories based on response patterns on the selfreport measures over time. Results: Among 236 participants, 48% were ages 3 to 6 years, 33% were 7 to 12 years, and 19% were 13 to 18 years. Sex was evenly distributed; 46% were Hispanic. Three latent classes of symptom trajectories were identified and classified into mild, moderate, and severe symptom trajectories. The only demographic characteristic with a significant relationship to membership in the latent class symptom trajectories was race/ethnicity. Other demographic characteristics including leukemia risk levels showed no significant relationships. Conclusions: This study is unique in that groups of patients with similar symptoms were identified rather than groups of symptoms. Further research using latent class growth analysis is needed. Funding: National Institutes of Health RO1 CA 1693398 O-190 ThreePhase Intervention Study of the Need for Systematic Prevention and Treatment of Constipation in Children and Adolescents with Cancer M.D. Jeppesen 1, N. Panduro1, H. Haslund2 1Aalborg University Hospital, Department of pediatric oncology, Aalborg, Denmark; 2Aalborg University Hospital, Clinical nursing research unit, Aalborg, Denmark Background/Objectives: Children and adolescents with cancer often suffer from constipation due to chemotherapy and treatment with opioids. Constipation may cause pain, anal fissures, septicemia and delays in therapy. Studies also show that constipation contributes to poor quality of life. Because of the many specialized tasks requiring the attention of nurses and doctors, management of constipation may be neglected. Furthermore, nausea and pain may make oral intake of laxatives difficult. Design/Methods: The aim of the study is to reduce severe complications caused by constipation in children and adolecents with cancer. The study is a threephase intervention study. In the first phase the problem is explored through audit of 15 patient records, parent reported \"stool diaries\" using the Bristol Scale, focus group interviews with pediatric oncology doctors and nurses, and interviews with parents and patients. In the second phase a practice guideline will be developed based on the results of phase one, and in the third phase the interventional guideline is implemented. Results: In phase one data from parents showed that it was difficult to accommodate extensive oral information at the time of diagnosis, and that it is difficult to ensure sufficient intake of laxatives. The diary has helped clarify stool patterns and has stressed the importance of using a common assesment tool. Data from health care professionals demonstrates the importance of systematic observation, documentation and care of constipation. Conclusions: Phase one has shown that systematic management of constipation is needed and that the use of an assesment tool by both parents and health care professionals may support this. In phase two the guideline will be developed, integrating the continuous use of Bristol scale to maintain focus on constipation care. In addition, we will write an information pamphlet for parents and promote the use of a stool diary. O-191 Why all the Questions? Parent descriptions of the Role of QuestionAsking in Their Learning: A Report from the Children's Oncology Group K. Kelly 1, J. Withycombe2, K. Stegenga3, C. Rodgers4 1Children's National Health System, Nursing Research and Quality Outcomes, Washington DC, USA; 2Emory University, Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing, Atlanta GA, USA; 3Children's Mercy Hospital, Division of Hematology Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplant, Kansas City MO, USA; 4Duke University, School of Nursing, Durham NC, USA Background/Objectives: Questionasking is used by researchers to evaluate parent understanding of their child's cancer and by clinicians to assess parents' response to education. During qualitative research to describe parent perceptions of new diagnosis education (Rogers et.al., 2016), we noted a preponderance of interview data related to parent and clinician questionasking. Because questionasking was not related to our original study aim, we returned to our data to complete this secondary analysis of parent descriptions of questioning after diagnosis of their child's cancer. Design/Methods: Using secondary qualitative analysis we reviewed the dataset (n=20 parents) to assure adequate fit between our research question and the data and then conducted a retrospective interpretation. Data were first independently coded by two members of the study team. After this, all coding decisions were discussed during weekly investigator calls with consensus agreement reached by all investigators. Results: Questionasking was not a straightforward process. A negative response to, \"Do you have any questions?\" was not always an accurate assessment of parent understanding. Parents sometimes reported being too confused or overwhelmed to ask. Parent questioning indicated unmet information needs or that parents were learning, e.g. parents who asked many questions were verifying their understanding with clinicians. Parents quickly learned from whom or where they could get their questions answered, which included written or online educational materials. Parents also expressed questions that they asked of themselves which included worries about their child's diagnosis and treatment or their ability to care for their child while balancing other life events. Conclusions: Understanding and responding to the reasons behind parent questionasking could facilitate parent learning and coping. Given the nuances ascribed to questionasking in parents, research is needed to also understand questionasking in children and adolescents with cancer.

O-192 Oncology Rounds Checklist Enhances Safety by Promoting Closed Loop Communication E. Lambrinos1, L. Morrissey1, A. Federico 1 1Boston Children's Hospital, Oncology, Boston MA, USA Background/Objectives: Communication breakdown between clinicians is a leading cause of medical errors. Dr. Atul Gawande describes that the implementation of checklists improves team communication and ultimately decrease patient complications[i]. At our institution, oncology rounds offer dedicated time when the multidisciplinary team and family gather to set daily goals. Interruptions are common, creating risk for lost or misinterpreted information. In response, a daily rounds checklist was designed to promote closed loop communication at the conclusion of rounds. [i] Gawande, A. (2010). Checklist Manifesto, The (HB). Penguin Books India. Design/Methods: In 2013, a paperbased checklist was piloted, providing a tool to prompt the oncology team to summarize and confirm the patient plan before leaving the bedside. The checklist is read aloud and takes 2030 seconds to complete, summarizing patient information including treatment plan, upcoming diagnostic tests/procedures, antimicrobials, fever plan, nutrition, lines/tubes, labs, and discharge planning. Once the feasibility of a rounds checklist was established, a webbased checklist was created which interfaces with the patient medical record, offering the capability to store patient information and access medication lists, labs, and other current information. Results: A rounds checklist prompts the team to pause and recap the plan for the day, promoting clear communication and ensuring that responsibilities are clearly delineated. Clinicians report that potential errors are identified, discharge planning is initiated earlier, and unnecessary or redundant labs, tests and medications are intercepted. Conclusions: Checklists are cost effective tools that improve patient outcomes and decrease untoward complications. At our institution, a daily rounds checklist has been found to improve the efficiency of rounds while promoting a climate of safety and family centered care. Future directions include the development of quality reports to determine the checklist's impact on safety, patient and staff satisfaction, clear delineation of roles and responsibilities, and cost savings. O-193 Caregiver Burden and Coping Strategies in a Low Resource Country: A Quantitative and Exploratory Study Conducted in an Indian Pediatric Oncology Unit A. Mahajan 1, M. BODHANWALA2, J Wadia Hospital For Children, Administration, Mumbai, India; 3B J Wadia Hospital For Children, Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Mumbai, India Background/Objectives: Caregivers often experience difficulty in helping children with cancer to cope with the emotional impact of the illness because of their own psychological distress. In a low resource country, the child and family often stagger from hospital to hospital and city to city seeking care, thus creating emotional and financial hardships. We assessed the level of burden and coping among caregivers of children diagnosed with cancer in one Mumbai hospital. Design/Methods: A quantitative and exploratory study (by questionnaire) was conducted in 20152016, with 100 caregivers, to measure their physical, psychological, social, occupational, spiritual and economic burden and coping strategies. Level of burden and coping strategies were corelated with selected demographic variables. Data was analysed and measured using t test and coefficient of correlation techniques. Results: Ninetyfive per cent of caregivers were parents; (mothers 60% fathers 35%) and others 5%. A high level of burden among caregivers was observed mainly in parents. Mothers' emotional strain due to the child's illness and their ability to manage it and family cohesion were predictive of distress, both concurrently and prospectively. The greater use of self directed coping strategies was related to higher levels of distress, for the fathers, and high levels of burden due to financial and employment problems were related to number hospital admissions for the child were significant. Conclusions: Findings shows that longterm cancer treatment attributes to an increase in caregiver burden and the impact of stress on parental quality of life. Unfortunately, caregiver adopted coping strategies can be fleeting due to fears of relapse and the uncertainty about their child's disease condition. Health care providers can identify gaps in the provision of a holistic clinical and psychosocial care to overcome caregiver burden and support caregivers to adopt appropriate coping strategies. O-194 Evaluation of ParentChild Conversations Surrounding Li Fraumeni Syndrome Genetic Testing M. Belinda 1, J. Valdez2, J. Gattuso1, S. Ogg1, B. Walker1, J. Bosi1, K. Nichols2 1St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Division of Nursing Research, Memphis, USA; 2St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Division of Cancer Predisposition, Memphis, USA Background/Objectives: Advances in genetic technologies have revealed a growing number of heritable disorders associated with an increased risk to develop cancer during childhood. Dialogues about cancer genetic testing and the implications of genetic risk status on children rest primarily with parents. It is vital to understand if, when and how parents and children communicate about genetic testing for heritable cancer. The study objective is to determine whether and how parents communicate with their children about genetic testing for LiFraumeni syndrome (LFS), a rare and highly penetrant cancer predisposing condition. Design/Methods: Semistructured interviews examined parents' decisions regarding the pursuit of LFS testing for their children and the communications surrounding test results. Transcripts were evaluated using a grounded theory approach to determine parents decision to initiate a conversation with their children and their selfefficacy for holding this conversation. Results: This study evaluated interviews from 14 parents whose children tested positive for LFS. All 14 parents emphasized the importance of involving their child(ren) in conversations about undergoing LFS genetic testing and disclosure of the test results. Many parents selfidentified as being from a \"cancer family\". Based on negative past experiences consisting of exclusion from conversations regarding cancer, these parents stated that they would approach communications about cancer with their children in a more open and inclusive manner. Nevertheless, evaluation of the interviews showed that only 9 of 14 parents (64%) actually disclosed the LFS test result to their child(ren). Conclusions: While parents express a desire for open conversations with their child(ren) regarding LFS genetic testing, such discussions do not always occur. Communication is essential to enable understanding of genetic risk status and compliance with treatment, prevention and surveillance measures. Development of educational materials and other interventions to facilitate ageappropriate parentchild conversations about genetic testing and genetic risk status for cancer is needed. O-195 Oncology Nurse Case Managers: Improving Care for Children in SubSaharan Africa N. Mariam 1 1Uganda Cancer Institute, Nursing, kampala, Uganda Background/Objectives: Treatment adherence plays a critical role in cancer management and leads to better clinical outcomes. Treatment adherence is a significant issue at the Uganda Cancer Institute (UCI), with many patients abandoning treatment before it is complete. The primary reasons for this, we believe, are poor communication, lack of social and financial supports. The role of nurse case manager (CM) was developed to improve patient outcomes by addressing these issues. Objectives: 1. Describe the role of nurse case managers in improving treatment adherence and clinical outcomes for patients treated at the Uganda Cancer Institute. Design/Methods: Barriers to treatment adherence were identified and the role of CM was developed to address these issues. based on personal experience as a CM on the pediatric ward for 4 years at the UCI. Results: UCI is the only cancer treatment center in Uganda, treating over 30,000 patients annually from Uganda and surrounding countries. Treatment begins 2 to 4 weeks after diagnosis due to the complex health care navigation processes and limited resources of families. Before CM, these ongoing challenges frequently led to treatment abandonment. Now, the CM is the first contact for patients when they arrive at UCI and are given our contact information so they can contact us. We assess the family's social and financial resources, explain the diagnosis, treatment plan including the number of hospital visits and treatment duration. We closely monitor the patients' progress and facilitate communication between the patient, family, and clinicians. We followup between hospital visits, provide counseling, and direct nursing. Most importantly, we advocate for our patients by relaying patient concerns to clinicians, mobilizing funds when possible, and connecting families with community resources. Conclusions: Oncology treatments are increasingly complex, and present unique challenges for oncology nurses in resource limited countries like Uganda. Nurse case managers will play an important role in improving outcomes. O-196 Survey Reveals Barriers to the Delivery of Quality Pediatric Oncology Nursing Care in Low and MidIncome Countries (L&MIC) L. Morrissey 1, M. Lurvey1, C. Sullivan2, Day3, Hospital, Internationa Outreach Program, Memphis, USA; 3St. Jude Research Hospital, International Outreach Program, Memphis, USA; 4University of California at San Francisco UCSF Hospital, Nursing, San Francisco, USA; 5Unaffiliated, Unaffiliated, Amsterdam, Netherlands Antilles; 6Leeds Teaching Hospitl Nursing, Banso, Cameroon; 8Indus Childrens CAncer Hospital, Oncology Nursing, Pakistan Background/Objectives: In 2014, the SIOP PODC Nursing Workgroup published baseline standards describing elements of nursing care essential to promote optimal patient outcomes. The SIOP Baseline Standards Taskforce developed a validated survey to measure the degree to which nursing standards are being met in paediatric oncology programs worldwide, and to compare responses from low, mid and high income countries (HIC) to identify trends by income level. Design/Methods: A validated survey addressing the six baseline standards was electronically distributed to a convenience sample of 208 pediatric oncology nurses from 64 countries. The survey was translated into four languages and administered in REDCap. Responses were compared based on World Bank defined income levels. Results: A 50% response rate from 104 nurses from 56 countries was achieved. Results revealed that nurse staffing levels on oncology wards and intensive care units in L&MIC are significantly lower than HIC (p < .0001). Nurses in LIC nurses caring for oncology patients are rotated more frequently (65% vs. 97%, p = .002) and are less likely to receive formal orientation programs. Significant differences exist in the inclusion of nurses in multidisciplinary meetings (p < .0001). Resources for safe care such as infusion pumps and personal protective equipment are often insufficient in L&MIC. Evidence based policies are available in 64.5% of reporting LIC, compared to 96.7% in HIC (p = .003). Conclusions: Results from the SIOP PODC Baseline Standards survey indicate that significant gaps exist in staffing levels, education, resources and institutional support for L&MIC pediatric oncology nurses. Survey results will be used to advocate for increased nursing support in L&MIC pediatric cancer units. Further research will determine if adherence to the baseline standards for pediatric oncology nurses is linked to favorable patient outcomes. O-197 Pediatric Oncology Nurses' Experiences with PrognosisRelated Communication A. Newman 1 1Medical College of Wisconsin, Pediatric Oncology, Milwaukee, USA Background/Objectives: Providers in pediatric oncology are faced with the challenge of communicating the devastating news of a cancer diagnosis and prognosis. While the initial conversation regarding prognosis is generally considered the responsibility of the physician, patients and family members will subsequently turn to nurses for clarification of the information presented. If nurses are excluded from initial conversations, they may feel as though they are \"working in the dark,\" trying to answer questions while not contradicting what the physician said. Little has been reported regarding pediatric oncology nurses' experiences with such communication. The purpose of this research was to examine nurses' experiences with prognosisrelated communication (PRC) and the associations with interprofessional collaboration, quality of care, and nurse moral distress. Design/Methods: A mixedmethods approach utilizing an online survey incorporating validated measures of PRC, interprofessional collaboration, quality of care, and moral distress accompanied by focus groups was used to meet study objectives. Results: Findings demonstrated that nurses strongly agreed that prognostic disclosure is critical for decision making, but are challenged in determining their role. Nurses who had more years of experience, more training in PRC, worked outpatient or inpatient/outpatient, and indicated higher levels of collaboration reported more positive experiences with PRC. A significant correlation was identified between experiences with PRC and collaboration, and both were significantly associated with measures of quality of care and moral distress. Conclusions: Nurses should work to be active participants in PRC. When nurses sense that prognostic discussions have not occurred or if clarity is needed, nurses should feel confident in approaching physician colleagues to ensure parent understanding and satisfaction around communication. Future research and education should aim to develop interprofessional training to enhance communication and collaboration among nurses and physicians to ensure the highest quality of communication and care to patients and families. O-198 Accidental Dislodgment and Obstruction of Central Venous Catheters as a Nursing Care Indicator at an Brazilian Pediatric Oncology Hospital R.C. Ribeiro 1, Department, Brazil; 2Barretos Childrens Cancer Hospital, Pediatric Surgery Department, Barretos, Brazil Background/Objectives: Use of Central Venous Catheters (CVC) is essential in children when treating malignant diseases. The maintenance of catheter reflects the quality of nursing care. Catheter obstruction or accidental dislodgement due to traction are noninfectious complications and can be considered as a quality indicator in an oncologic pediatric hospital setting. Our purpose was analyze those complications related to CVC removal in a hospitalized pediatric oncology patients from a developing country hospital. Design/Methods: A prospective analysis using the reporting system (SAS Interact \u00ae) from a pediatric oncology hospital at a developing country database between February 2016 to August 2016. We analyzed demographic features, rate of CVC removal due to noninfectious complications (accidental dislodgment or catheter obstruction) and the number of patients with CVC per day, multiplied by 100. Results: Hundredfourteen CVC were inserted into 110 children during the 6month period. From 110 catheters removed, thirteen were due to noninfectious reasons, nine related to accidental dislodgment, four to obstruction. Average catheter life was 12.8 days, with a total of 911 catheter days. Regarding CVC events, the pediatric ward had an average of 143 CVC insertions per month, and an incidence of CVC removal of 0.85 per 100 catheterdays. At Bone Marrow Transplant Unit had an average of 59 CVC patients per month, and removal incidence of 1.07 per 100 catheter days. The Pediatric Intensive Care Unit had an average of 118 CVC patients per month, what represented 60% of it occupation, and removal incidence of 0.11 per 100 catheter days. Overall hospital CVC removal incidence was 0.41 per 100 catheter days. Conclusions: Noninfectious CVC removal can be used as an indicator of nursing care at pediatric oncology hospitals and give an assertiveness related of improvements, to decrease this rate improving children nursing care. O-199 Telephone Triage: Standardized Practice in Paediatric Oncology K. Newcastle, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: Paediatric Oncology nurses are often the first point of contact for overwhelmed parents. Patients are often assessed over the telephone with regards to acute oncology emergencies and advice/symptom management. Nurses are expected to make clinical decisions regarding patient care without visually assessing the patient or using a systematic uniformed approach. The Great North Children hospital, a principal treatment centre (PTC) has adopted the use of the United Kingdom Oncology Nursing Society (UKONS) Telephone Triage Kit. An audit as to the effectiveness of the tool was conducted. Design/Methods: The UKONS telephone triage kit provides a pathway for a nurse assessment over the telephone. The nurse will use a traffic light toxicity grading system to initiate emergency treatment or advice. In addition, patients who score an amber toxicity are required a 24 hour call back to promote early intervention and patient safety. A retrospective peer review of telephone triage calls were evaluated including diagnosis, time of call, duration of call, main complaint, toxicity grading and patient journey over a four month period from January 2016.Nurses perceptions and challenges of using the tool in the clinical environment were also explored. Results: 384 calls were received within the four month period, this having a significant impact on service provision as the average call lasted ten minutes. Data indicated nursing staff gave concise advice and symptom management using a valid tool. Nurses reported using toxicity grading gave them confidence and consistency in the advice offered. Highlighted areas for improvement included documentation regarding patient details and establishing contact within 24 hours after the initial telephone call. Conclusions: The UKONS triage tool is an invaluable resource within PTC setting. Data collected was discussed with management to allocate resources appropriately. Further educational and peer review sessions to highlight the importance of documentation and telephone call back are recommended. O-200 AYA Involvement in Cancer Treatment Decision Making: An Ethnographic Study K. PykeGrimm 1, B. HalpernFelsher2, L. Franck3, R. Goldsby4, R. Rehm3 1Lucile Packard Children's Hospital, Center for Nursing Excellence, Stanford, USA; 2Stanford, Department of Pediatrics, Palo Alto, USA; 3UCSF, School of Nursing, San Francisco, USA; 4UCSF, Department of Pediatrics, San Francisco, USA Background/Objectives: Survival rates among adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer patients have improved minimally over the past decade. AYAs experience treatment nonadherence rates as high as 60% that can lead to relapse and even death. Open communication, positive family relationships and involvement of AYAs in treatment decisions and illness management support treatment adherence. However, there is limited research exploring AYA involvement and experiences in treatment decisionmaking (TDM). The purpose of this ongoing study is to explore and describe AYA experiences with cancer TDM. Design/Methods: Twelve AYAs on treatment for cancer and within one year of their diagnosis participated in an interpretive ethnographic study that included interviews and informal participant observation. Participants were asked to reflect on a major TDM experience (e.g., clinical trial or surgery) and other decisions since diagnosis. Analysis included field notes, analytic memos and coding of interview transcripts using Atlas.ti. Results: Preliminary findings were drawn from 22 interviews with 12 AYAs (6 male, 5 female, 1 nonbinary) between 15 and 20 years old. AYAs distinguish between major treatment decisions and care preferences. Involvement in decisionmaking varied from having no involvement in the decision, accepting the decision, being involved in discussions and assuming a shared or primary role in decisionmaking and for some, changed over time. AYAs preferred parental involvement and appreciated their support in TDM. Friends and other family members were supportive but not involved in TDM. Factors influencing TDM included uncertainty about the treatment, altruism and quality of life. Conclusions: Findings highlight the range of involvement of the AYA in TDM. Overall, they felt informed, part of discussions and viewed themselves as sharing in or making treatment decisions. AYA preferences for participation in TDM may vary over time and by type of decision. Parents play a particularly important supportive role. O-201 Intervention to Improve Adherence to the Use of Personal Protective Equipment for the Administration of Chemotherapy L. Segovia1, L. Rojas 1, P. Francisca1, A. Torelli1 Mackenna, Unidad de Oncologia, Santiago, Chile Background/Objectives: Chemotherapy administration is a high risk procedure for nursing staff because of the potential teratogenic, carcinogenic, mutagenic damage and other toxic effects associated with exposure. In the oncology unit of the Hospital Luis Calvo Mackenna there are protocols of administration, based on the recommendation of international organisms. The unit has all the necessary personal protective elements (PPE) for safe administration. Every nurse who joins the unit receives a comprehensive fourweek orientation program that emphasizes the safe administration of chemotherapy, content that is reinforced annually in the continuing education program. Adherence to protocol compliance is monitored monthly by applying a checklist. This checklist assesses aspects of safety management for both the patient and the nursing staff. The item related to staff protection assesses whether the nurses use all the PPE described in the protocol. Monitoring conducted in August 2016 shows that 100% of nurses are not using all the PPE defined in the protocol. Design/Methods: In September 2016, an educational intervention to 100% of the Oncology Nurses was carried out focused on chemotherapy safe handling and administration. In October of the same year the checklist is reapplied. Results: 83% of the Oncology Nurses do not use all the PPE according to the Chemotherapy Administration Protocol. 100% of the nurses assesses do not use eye protection and 17% do not use gloves. Conclusions: Despite all the information and training that nurses receive, there is a low adherence to the policy and protocol, which mainly impacts on a potential risk to the health of nurses. A new intervention is proposed to know the reason for this low adherence by the nurses. O-202 Parental Distress 6 Months After a Pediatric Cancer Diagnosis in Relation to Family Psychosocial Risk at Diagnosis S. Children's Research Hospital, Department of Psychology, Memphis, USA; 2Princess Maxima Center for pediatric oncology, Psychosocial Research and Care Innovation, Utrecht, The Netherlands; 3Emma Children's Hospital Academic Medical Center, Psychosocial Department, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; 4Amalia Children's Hospital Radboud University Medical Center, Medical Psychology, Nijmegen, The Netherlands Background/Objectives: Parents of children with cancer are at increased risk for experiencing distress and it is important to identify families that are in need for support at an early stage. This study aimed to (1) assess fathers' and mothers' distress as measured by the Distress Thermometer for parents (DTP) at 6 months postdiagnosis (T2), and (2) assess if distress at 6 months postdiagnosis could be predicted from Psychosocial Assessment Tool (PAT) risk profiles at approximately one month postdiagnosis (T1). Design/Methods: A sample of 119 mothers and 98 fathers completed the DTP at T2. The sample was compared to a healthy reference group of 671 mothers and 463 fathers. The DTP consists of a thermometer score (ranging from 010, >= 4 is clinical distress), and problem domains (total, practical, social, emotional, physical, cognitive, and parenting <2 years and 2 years of age). The PAT, a family psychosocial risk screener, was assessed at T1. Within the pediatric cancer group, DTPs of parents with elevated total PATscores (targeted/clinical) were compared to DTPs of parents with low PATscores (universal). Results: Parents of children with cancer more often reported clinical distress than parents of healthy children on the DTP thermometer score more problems on all DTP domains (p<.001.042), except for the parenting domain for children <2 years of age. Furthermore, parental distress at T2 was predicted from family psychosocial risk at T1, as parents with elevated total PATscores reported more problems than parents with low PATscores on the DTP thermometer score (fathers: p=.026, mothers p=.018) and on most of the DTP domains (p<.0011.00). Conclusions: The results of this study point towards the importance of family psychosocial risk screening at diagnosis, and the need for applying tailored interventions, such that later parental distress can be reduced or prevented. O-203 The Interventions Core to Pediatric Oncology Nursing: A National Survey of Clinical Application in China J. Sun1, N. Shen 2, H. Lu2 1Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Nursing, Shanghai, China; 2Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Nursing, Shanghai, China Background/Objectives: In our previous study, we investigated the application frequency of 5 hospitals in 4 regions, and found that there had differences between the hospital in North China and the others, but the single hospital can not fully represent the region. Thus, in this study, we want to know national clinical application of the core interventions performed by pediatric oncology nurses and analysis its variance of region. Design/Methods: An online survey of application frequency of 82 core interventions, conducted by experts consensus based on Nursing Interventions Classification (NIC) was send to all the pediatric oncology nurses from 18 nation wide selected hospitals in January to February 2016. Results: 444 clinical nurses completed the questionnaire. The application rate of 82 core interventions were from 74.1% to 100%. As to domains, there were differences in basic and complex physiology domain (North China vs East, West China, p<0.05), behavioral and family domain (North China vs East China, p<0.05), health system domain (North China vs West China, p<0.05). As to classes, nurses in different region performed different frequently (p<0.05) in elimination, immobility management, nutrition support, selfcare promotion, electrolyte and acidbase management, respiratory management, skin/wound management, thermoregulation, tissue perfusion management, Patient Education, Psychological Comfort Promotion, lifespan care. Conclusions: Core interventions of pediatric oncology nursing were frequently performed in practice, showing difference by the groups of regions, especially North China. When doing the homogenization training, trainers need to think about the reasons for the different clinical application by regions as shown in this study, in order to develop different proportion of training content. Found: Shanghai Municipal Education Commission - Gaoyuan Nursing Grant Support (Hlgy16073qnhb) O-204 Development of a Pediatric Oncology Nursing Curriculum in Cambodia E. Sniderman 1, P. Johnson2, S. Sath3 1Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, Division of Hematology Oncology Stem Cell Transplant, Chicago, USA; 2Children's Mercy Hospital, Pediatric Oncology, Kansas City, USA; Children, Pediatrics/Pediatric Oncology, Reap, Cambodia Background/Objectives: The Angkor Hospital for Children (AHC) is one of two facilities in Cambodia that offers comprehensive cancer care for children, however treatment is currently limited to retinoblastoma and Wilms tumor, partially due to nursing limitations. AHC's pediatric oncology program is currently expanding. As part of the hospital's fiveyear strategic plan, the development of a nursing curriculum and ongoing mentoring and training of oncology nurses were identified as priorities. Design/Methods: In conjunction with ASCOHealth Volunteers Overseas, volunteer oncology Nurse Practitioners (NPs) visited AHC over a two year period. A formal assessment of the current knowledge base, resources, and challenges of the pediatric oncology nurses was performed using the SIOP PODC Baseline Standards for Paediatric Oncology Nursing Care in Low and Middle Income Countries. AHC nurses, educators, and other oncology team members collaborated in the assessment process. Results: The formal assessment identified gaps in knowledge, unsafe chemotherapy administration practices, and misconceptions regarding chemotherapy safety. This informed the creation of a curriculum adapted to the needs and resources of the hospital. Seven modules were created to be taught over 6 months. Content includes an introduction to childhood cancer/diseases, chemotherapy, supportive care and symptom management, infection control, emergencies, palliative care and pain management, and psychosocial considerations. Future modules will focus on late effects and central line care. Several interactive teaching strategies help create a dynamic teaching environment. Modules will be taught by the director of education and pediatric oncologist at AHC as well as by visiting international nurses/NPs. Conclusions: Nurses with specialized education and training in pediatric oncology are essential for successful comprehensive cancer care. Formal assessment using internationally accepted standards of pediatric oncology nursing care, adaptation of education to the limited resource setting, and collaboration with local team members were key steps in ensuring high quality cancer care will be provided to the children of Cambodia. O-205 Evaluation of a Teenage and Young Adult (TYA) Long Term FollowUp (LTFU) Service for Survivors of Cancer in Childhood L. Soanes 1, E. Potter2 1University College London, Children& Young People Services, London, United Kingdom; 2The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, Oak Centre for Children & Young People, London, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: Each year 1600 children are diagnosed with cancer in the United Kingdom; the survival rate for whom is now 80% (1). Survivors are known to be at increased risk of poorer psychosocial and physical outcomes than their peers (2). These effects occur soon after treatment or many years later (3), therefore it is recommended survivors follow a riskstratified pathway of LTFU for life (4, 5). A crucial stage of this pathway occurs in late adolescence as patients move from child to adult services, a process that should be one of proactive transition rather than sudden transfer (6). To meet these recommendations a model of transition was introduced to children's and TYA principal treatment centre over a two year period. In 2016 a service evaluation was carried out to assess the acceptance and effectiveness of this model. Design/Methods: Using a mixed methods approach a sample of TYA aged 1625 years olds attending the TYA LTFU clinics were identified and data collected to measure acceptance and effectiveness of the mode through: online patient experience survey 1:1 patient telephone interviews qualitative and quantitative analysis of clinic consultations qualitative and quantitative analysis of patient contact to the CNS for LTFU outside clinics. Results: The model of transition though largely accepted was for some a significant challenge; at times this went beyond the patient to the family, in particular mothers whose role as carer was also in transition. The need for time, a multidisciplinary and multimethod of approach to facilitate patient knowledge and self confidence in transition was identified as a key factor in both acceptance and effectiveness of the model. Conclusions: This service evaluation has highlighted key factors in establishing a transition model and identified areas to ensure transition is truly holistic. O-206 Sustainable Model for Nursing Education in Latin America: 10 Years Later C. Sullivan 1, L. Segovia Weber2, P. Viveros Lamas3, S. Day4, G. Rivera1 1St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Dept. of Global Pediatric Medicine, Memphis, USA; 2Luis Calvo Mackenna Hospital, Latin American Education, Santiago, Chile; 3Luis Calvo Mackenna Hospital, Latin Center for Pediatric Nursing Education, Santiago, Chile; 4St. Jude Children's Research Hospital/University of Tennesse Health Science Center, Dept. of Global Pediatric Medicine/College of Nursing, Memphis, USA Background/Objectives: Ten years ago, the Latin American Center for Pediatric Oncology Nursing Education was created at Calvo Mackenna Hospital in Santiago, Chile as an initiative of the International Outreach Program at St Jude Children\u00b4s Research Hospital (SJCRH), to enhance the quality of pediatric oncology nursing care in Latin America through establishing the pediatric oncology nurse educator role. Design/Methods: The program consists of 4 weeks theoretical/skills training and clinical observation (176 hours) in pediatric oncology nursing, supportive care, and education. Theoretical portions include expositiveparticipative lectures in pediatric oncology and education, using adult learning principles. Onsite and ongoing mentoring is provided in development of tailored education programs and quality projects. Program evaluation consists of pre/posttests and successful demonstration of curriculum development and delivery. Results: To date, 25 nurse educators from Mexico, Central America, South America, and the Caribbean completed the program. A network of Latin American nurse educators developed through ongoing mentoring/collaboration with graduates. Active members represent 13 hospitals in 8 countries and presently impact over 800 nurses. Additionally, quality improvement projects for correct patient identification are ongoing at several sites. Conclusions: The Latin American Center for Pediatric Oncology Nursing Education has proven to be a successful and sustainable model to promote excellence in pediatric oncology nursing education and quality in Latin America through development of the pediatric oncology nurse educator role. O-207 Promoting Standardized Chemotherapy/Biotherapy Education in Latin America: An Aphon Initiative C. Sullivan 1, K. Belderson2, J. Challinor8 1St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Dept. of Global Pediatric Medicine, Memphis, USA; 2Children's Hospital Colorado, Nursing Education, Denver, USA; 3Luis Calvo Mackenna Hospital, Latin American Education, Santiago, Chile; 4Luis Calvo Mackenn Hospital, Latin Center for Pediatric Oncology Nursing Education, Santiago, Chile; 5Renaissance Doctors Hospital, Juan I. Menchaca\", Guadalajara, Mexico; 8UCSF, Association of Pediatric Hematology Oncology Nurses (APHON) has received numerous inquiries from nurses in low and middleincome countries (LMIC) interested in the Chemotherapy/Biotherapy certification course. APHON certification is recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics and aligns with SIOP PODC Nursing baseline standards recommendation for formalized training in chemotherapy preparation and handling globally. In response to international interest, the International Task Force set out to evaluate the feasibility of adapting and piloting Spanish courses throughout Latin America. Design/Methods: A survey of nurses in Latin America verified interest and need for the course in 2015. Recommendations for adaptation were incorporated from two bilingual Chilean nurse educators, who took the English course at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH). The Task Force, Chemotherapy Committee, and Spanish WG modified/expanded the course over the next year, and materials were professionally translated with support from SJCRH. Spanishfluent APHONcertified instructors were identified to teach the courses. Results: An inaugural twocohort pilot was held in Chile (32 nurses, AprilMay 2016), followed by a second pilot with Central American nurses and an English instructor course (Associaci\u00f3n Hemato/Oncolog\u00eda Pedi\u00e1trica de Centro America preconference at SJCRH (24/6 February 2017)). Additional pilots are scheduled in Argentina (Sociedad Latina Americana de Oncolog\u00eda Pedi\u00e1trica (110 nurses, April 2017)) and Mexico (55 nurses, May 2017). All nurses of the Chilean pilots and 82% of nurses of the AHOPCA pilot passed the exam. Comparison of results for the four pilots will be presented. Conclusions: Since 80% of children and adolescents with cancer live in LMIC, it is paramount that their nurses have specialized training in chemotherapy/biotherapy. The APHON survey documented interest and need for standardized chemotherapy/biotherapy education across Latin America. Pilots have demonstrated course appropriateness for nurses' practice. Future plans include developing an instructor community to promote sustainable, standardized Spanish courses and exploring expansion to other regions. O-208 Analysis of the Interventions Performed in Pediatric HematologyOncology Unit Based on Nursing Interventions Classification (NIC6TH) J. Sun 1, N. Shen2, H. Lu2, M. Children's Medical Center, Nursing, Shanghai, China; 3Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Pediatric HematologyOncology, Shanghai, China Background/Objectives: In previous study, we used experts consensus to identify the core interventions done by pediatric hematologyoncology nurses, but core interventions was just the interventions which nurses mostly performed in discipline.Therefore, this study was to identify all the interventions performed by pediatric hematologyoncology nurses through records in hospital information system (HIS) and analysis its characteristic. Design/Methods: The research team selected a 42 beds pediatric hematologyoncology unit, and drawn all the nursing interventions in nursing record and doctor's order from our HIS from 1 September 2016 to 30 December 2016, using Nursing Interventions Classification (NIC) to do the matching and then counting their frequencies.Then giving each intervention its own time and difficulty code according to NIC Time code refers to the average time needed to perform the intervention, 1=15 minutes or less; 2=16 to 30 minutes; 4=46 to 60 minutes; 5=more than 1 hours. Difficulty code refers to the minimal education level necessary to perform the intervention in most cases, 1=nursing assistant; 2=RN ; 3=RN with postbasic education or certification. Results: 4044 unique statements (1908 from nursing record, 2136 from doctor's order) were drawn from HIS matching to 77 interventions (56 from nursing record, 61 from doctor's order, 30 were the same).77 interventions belonged to 6 domains and 20 classes. The average difficulty was 1.88 and average time was 2.06. Conclusions: Nurses in pediatric hematologyoncology unit performed totally 77 interventions. There still had some interventions just needed by nursing assistant but done by nurses, which should call for nurse managers to think about the suitable stuffing. The result of this study was expected to be useful in understanding how to improve pediatric hematologyoncology nursing and the standardization of nursing interventions.

Wiener 1, S. zadeh 1NCI, Pediatric Oncology Branch, Bethesda, USA; 2National Institute of Mental Health, Office of the Director, Bethesda, USA Background/Objectives: An interdisciplinary group of experts and stakeholders developed evidencebased standards for psychosocial care in pediatric cancer. One standard, supported by 149 high quality papers, recommends that youth with cancer and their family members routinely receive systematic assessments of their psychosocial needs. While valid and reliable measures are available for parents to report on their family and child's psychosocial needs, there are limited psychometrically valid selfreport measures to assess distress in medically ill children. A multiphase study guided the development of a brief electronic distress screen called Checking In. Design/Methods: Phase I: 281 PatientCaregiverProvider triads, with youth aged 721 with cancer and other chronic illnesses completed the Distress Thermometer (DT) and measures of depression, anxiety, pain, and fatigue. Findings identified items to include in a new version of a pediatric distress screen. Phase II: 15 cognitive interviews were conducted with patients in each age group (812; 1317; 1821). Health care providers gave input on development of a summary report. Results: Substantial discrepancy between parent and child specific distress symptoms on the DT indicated that parent input alone is not sufficient to identify child distress or to guide referrals. 15 most frequently endorsed symptoms were included in Checking In. Cognitive interviews tested the accuracy and quality of the items and identified errors in the response choices. Differences in wording recommendations based on age were found. Suggestions for design, format, and response options were incorporated. Conclusions: Checking In assesses emotional, physical, social, practical, and spiritual concerns of pediatric patients as well as suicidal ideation and adherence. An accompanying provider document summarizes patient and caregiver report of the child's distress in real time, to allow providers to triage services. Testing the reliability, validity, measurement variance, and responsiveness of Checking In and assessment of concordance of symptom ratings by patients and caregivers will follow. Educational Day Fertility O-210 Decision Support Tools in Paediatric and Adolescent Oncofertility for Clinicians and Parents Y. Jayasinghe 1, M. Kemertzis1, M. Hand2, C. Allingham3, 3Notre Dame University, Medicine, Sydney, Australia; Ethics Service, Melbourne, Hospital, Children's Cancer 8Royal Children's Hospital, Surgery, Melbourne, Australia Background/Objectives: Fertility preservation decisions for children are difficult and there is a need for decision support for clinicians and families. Our aim was to develop and evaluate electronic decisional support tools for clinicians and parents of children with cancer at The Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne. Design/Methods: Electronic decision support systems were developed based on the literature and consultation with stakeholders. The clinician tool outlined clinician roles and responsibilities, linked to educational guidance, and included 'alerts' for best practice. Clinicians completed a survey on acceptance, and results were compared to a previous survey of 56 clinicians in 2014. The parent decision aid was based on International Patients Decision Aids Standards. Parents' of children with cancer who had previously made a fertility preservation decision were invited to complete surveys before and after review of the decision aid. Results: Thirtynine oncofertility clinicians (18% involved in over 100 fertility consultations) reviewed the clinician decision support system. Compared to 2014, clinician satisfaction with fertility consults increased from 33% to 54%, and confidence from 4070% (p<0.005). Most (92%) wanted to improve their fertility consultation skills, and stated the clinician tool clearly outlined responsibilities, with 88% stating they would always or often use it. Thirtyfour parents consented to the decision aid study, of whom 15 reviewed the parental tool. They reported it was appealing, 'very clearly' presented (73%), 'clearly' or 'very clearly' explained their child's fertility choices (87.0%). The tool improved fertility related knowledge by 15% (p=0.04) and 87% of parents reported it would have been 'helpful', 'very helpful' or 'extremely helpful' if available when making a fertility preservation decision. Conclusions: The clinician tool appeared acceptable to clinicians however further development is required. The parental decision aid was very acceptable and improved knowledge in parents. Prospective assessment in a clinical setting is planned. O-211 Factors Associated with FertilityRelated Knowledge in Survivors of Pediatric Cancer A.C. Ferrante 1, N.M. Caltabellotta1, L. Nahata1, C. Gerhardt1, V. Lehmann2 1The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital, for Biobehavioral Health, Columbus OH, USA; 2St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital, Department of Psychology, Memphis TN, USA Background/Objectives: Infertility is one of the most common late effects of certain cancer treatments. However, there is limited research on infertility in survivors of pediatric cancer. Thus, we assessed knowledge of cancerrelated infertility risk, perception of personal infertility risk, and knowledge of current fertility status and examined associations with demographic (i.e. gender, age, income level) and medical factors (i.e. diagnosis type, neurotoxicity of treatment). Design/Methods: Ninetyone survivors of pediatric cancer (M=29.82 years) participated in an online survey assessing knowledge of cancerrelated infertility risk, perception of personal infertility risk, and knowledge of current fertility status. All participants were ages 2040, diagnosed between ages 518 with leukemia (n=25), lymphoma (n=22), pediatric brain tumor (n=26), or other solid tumors (n=18), and at least 5 years postdiagnosis. Results: Most survivors were aware of their general risk for cancerrelated infertility (n=79, 87%), which varied by type of diagnosis (p<0.001) and treatment (p=0.032), such that survivors of brain tumors and those who received highdose neurotoxic treatment were less likely to know. Fortyseven survivors (52%) perceived that they were personally at risk for infertility, which was unrelated to examined factors. Almost half of all survivors (n=44; 48%) did not know their current fertility status, which was more common for younger survivors (p<0.001), survivors of brain tumors (31%; p=0.012), and those with lower income (p=0.013). Conclusions: Most adult survivors of pediatric cancer were aware of the general risk for cancerrelated infertility, and about half perceived themselves at risk or knew their fertility status. Several demographic and medical factors were related to knowledge in these domains. Future research should continue to identify strategies to provide reproductive counseling to survivors of pediatric cancer before and after treatment, and optimize fertility preservation rates for those at risk.

O-212 Development of Web Based Tailored Treatment Information to Enable Patient Participation and Empowerment. A Pilot Study in Wilms Tumor Patients and Families den HeuvelEibrink5, A.M.C. MavinkurveGroothuis5 1Princess M\u00e1xima Center, Psychosocial Research, Utrecht, Utrecht, Center, Children's council, Utrecht, The Netherlands Background/Objectives: In the Princess M\u00e1xima Center for pediatric oncology stimulating development is leading in care. Key principles are reduction of medical traumatic stress, adequate communication and family focus. Treatment of children with cancer is stressful for the child and the family. They are often overloaded with information, which is not always tailored to their needs. Their daily life is taken over by hospital visits and missing overview and control can lead to avoidable medical traumatic stress. Our aim is to design a tool that provides overview and tailored information of the treatment schedule. Design/Methods: In the first phase we analyzed the needs of different families. Personas were created with a focus group of 6 healthcare professionals to profile different family types. Contextual inquiry is performed to map activities in different stages of treatment. It will lead to knowledge on how and when information is shared with the families. In depth interviews will provide insights on preferences children and their families have in obtaining information about their disease and treatment. Results: We discussed and grouped 23 families with the focus group and identified 6 personas; reflecting differences in how families deal with disease, disease information and how they interact with health care professionals. The studies in the first phase lead to guidelines for a tool to communicate the Wilms Tumor treatment schedule addressing these differences. Conclusions: The result will be a visual, webbased, tailored treatment information tool, to increase patient participation and empowerment. By creating overview of the treatment program, understandable for children and their parents, we aim to support them in making decisions and preparing for procedures. We use personas to profile different families and address their specific needs. The next step is to design the tool and investigate whether this tool will lead to reduction of medical traumatic stress. O-213 Attitudes and Concerns About Parenthood and Fertiltiy Preservation among Adolescent and Young Adult Males and Their Parents During Cancer Survivorship N. Caltabellotta 1, A. Ferrante1, C. Health, Columbus, USA; 2St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Department of Psychology, Memphis, USA; 3Nationwide Children's Hospital, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Columbus, USA Background/Objectives: One in three males experiences fertility problems after pediatric cancer treatment yet less than 25% of pubertal males pursue fertility preservation (FP) before treatment. Although parents are responsible for making the majority of healthrelated decisions (including FP) during pediatric illness, it is unknown if parents are discussing parenthood and FP with their sons and are aware of their attitudes and concerns. The aims of this study were to examine attitudes about parenthood and FP among AYA males and their parents within the first seven years of cancer survivorship. Design/Methods: Ninetyone participants (35 AYA males, 31 mothers, 25 fathers) completed questions based on the Health Belief Model. Participants ranked items on a 5point Likert scale for themselves (if an AYA male) or their sons (if a parent). Analyses compared attitudes of male AYA survivors (1525 years, M=18.94) and parents as two distinct groups, and within 26 motherson pairs and 20 fatherson pairs on items pertaining to parenthood and benefits/barriers to FP. Results: Eighty percent of AYA males endorsed wanting a biological child, and 51% of survivors agreed a future without a child would make them sad. Thirtyone percent of AYA males thought speaking about FP with their parents would be embarrassing; a minority reported having conversations with their mothers (23%) and/or their fathers (17%) about sperm banking. Although 51% of AYA males were concerned they could pass on their cancer to their future children; neither mothers (p=0.003) nor fathers (p=0.002) shared this concern. Conclusions: Although most male AYA survivors desire biological children after treatment, they report difficulties discussing this with their parents and report barriers to FP of which their parents may be unaware. Future research needs to identify factors that contribute to these perceived barriers and strategies to facilitate conversations about parenthood and FP between AYA males and their parents. Haematology Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia PD-001 The Lymphoblastic Leukaemia: A CostUtility Analysis S. Basu1, P. Lin 2, C. Rowntree3, V. Saha4,5 1Shire, Head of Medical Affairs Oncology, 2Shire, Global HEOR Cambridge, USA; Cardiff, of Manchester, Paediatric Oncology, Manchester, Kingdom; 5Tata Center, Senior Paediatric Oncology, New Town Kolkata, India Background/Objectives: Asparaginase is a key component in the treatment of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In the UK, patients with newly diagnosed ALL receive PEGASP followed by Erwiniaderived asparaginase (ERWASP) in cases of hypersensitivity. Although native ASP is no longer used as the first choice of asparaginase therapy, it was the standard of care before PEGASP was available. This analysis evaluates the costeffectiveness of PEGASP in patients with newly diagnosed ALL compared to native asparaginase (nativeASP). Design/Methods: A combined decision tree/health state transition Markov model was developed to compare treatment sequences starting with PEGASP versus nativeASP, followed by ERWASP in cases of hypersensitivity. Pediatric, young adult (25 years), and adult (2665 years) patients were modelled using UKALL2003 and UKALL14 protocols. Analyses were stratified by high, intermediate, and standardrisk in pediatric patients, between patients aged 40 vs. 41 years, and on transplantation eligibility in the adult model. Key model parameters (survival, risk of hypersensitivity) were publicationbased with clinical input from key experts. In the basecase analysis, OS and EFS were assumed equivalent for PEGASP, nativeASP, and ERWASP, with 1,000IU/m2 dosing (per UKALL protocols) for PEGASP. In scenario analyses, 2,500 IU/m2 of PEGASP was examined (per SmPC), including variations in comparative survival and hypersensitivity rates. Incremental costeffectiveness ratios (ICER; incremental costs/qualityadjusted life years [QALYs] gained) were produced. Results: The basecase scenario demonstrated that PEGASP followed by ERWASP resulted in reduced costs and increased QALYs (total cost savings, \u00a34,741; total QALYs gained, 0.05) versus nativeASP followed by ERWASP. Scenario analyses highlighted the robustness of the results. Differences in total QALYs between PEGASP and nativeASP were driven primarily by the difference in hypersensitivity rates. Conclusions: This analysis demonstrates that PEGASP, as part of multidrug chemotherapy, is costeffective compared to nativeASP for children, young adults, and adults with newly diagnosed ALL. PD-002 Consequences of Decreasing Asparginase and Dexamethasone Theray to Avoid Excessive Toxicity in Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia: A Prospective Trial from a MiddleIncome Country K. Ghanem 1, D. El Tabech1, C. AlAridi1, M. Abboud1, H. ElSolh1, S. Muwakkit1 1American University of Beirut, Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Beirut, Lebanon Background/Objectives: The best outcome of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is achieved through an adequate balance between disease control and treatmentrelated toxicities. At the Children's Cancer Center of Lebanon, we implemented the St Jude TotalXV protocol with minor modifications to treat patients with ALL 118 years old. Between 20022013 (periodI), the protocol resulted in an excellent 5year overall (92.3%) and diseasefree survival (88.6%), however, a prospective, nonrandomized trial, we decreased dexamethasone dosage during continuation and intensification therapy by 25% for lowrisk and 33% for intermediate/high risk patients and stopped monthly dexamethasone pulses at 1.3 years instead of 2 years from initiation of continuation therapy. Asparaginase dose was decreased by 40% in induction for all patients, and 40% in intensification therapy for lowrisk patients. No prophylactic cranial irradiation was given. Results: The number of enrolled patients was 156 in periodI and 61 in periodII. After a median followup of 88 months (range: 24177 months), the 3year cumulative incidence of isolated were lowrisk, without initial CNS involvement. All five patients achieved second remission. One patient is currently in third remission after developing a second isolated CNS relapse. All CNS relapses occurred after 1.7 years from treatment initiation. The incidence of CMV retinitis, disseminated varicella, and CNS and 1.4%, respectively. The 3year cumulative incidence of death was not statistically different between the two periods (7.7 versus 9.3%, Gray P: 0.32). Conclusions: Decreasing dexamethasone and asparaginase dosages during childhood ALL therapy aiming to avoid treatmentrelated toxicities resulted in significant increase in isolated CNS relapse. PD-003 Molecular Genetic Profile in BCRABL1 Negative Pediatric BCell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Can Further Refine Outcome Prediction in Addition to That by EndInduction Minimal Residual Disease S. Gupta 1, S. Bakhshi2, A. Chopra1, R. Kumar1 1All India Institute of Medical Sciences AIIMS New Delhi, Lab Oncology, New Delhi, India; 2All India Institute of Medical Sciences AIIMS New Delhi, Medical Oncology, New Delhi, India Background/Objectives: Many patients with Bcell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (BALL) don't respond satisfactorily to the standard therapy. Currently, the poor responders are subjected to aggressive chemotherapy based on minimal residual disease (MRD) status. Recently, Moorman et al (2014) proposed molecular genetic criteria for better riskprediction in BALL. We undertook this study to assess their utility in BCRABL1 negative pediatric BALL, particularly with respect to the endinduction MRD status. Design/Methods: The new cases of BCRABL1 negative, pediatric BALL, enrolled over 18 months were classified as standard, intermediate, high risk and treated as per the institutional protocol. The patients with MRD positivity (>0.01%) by flow cytometry, at the end of induction chemotherapy were treated as high risk. The genomic DNA was analyzed for copy number alterations (CNAs) in CDKN2A/B, PAX5, IKZF1, and multiplex dependent probe amplification. The geneticprofile was assessed using Moorman criteria. Event free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were noted. Results: Seventysix cases with median age 7 years (2 months18 years) were finally analyzed. CNAs were detected in 49 (64.5%) cases. 24 cases were MRD positive, remaining were MRD negative low (20), intermediate (20), high risk (12) cases. The genetic profile could identify two subgroups with significantly different EFS (p=0.045) and OS (p=0.037) in the MRD negative intermediate risk group. The genetic profile also separated two subgroups with significantly different EFS (p=0.036) in the MRD positive group, however the OS was not different (p=0.293). The analysis in other subgroups did not reveal any significant differences. Conclusions: The genetic profile identified distinct subgroups in MRDnegative intermediaterisk and MRDpositive cases of BALL. This indicates that the intermediaterisk patients can be further segregated for therapy assignment, based on the geneticprofile. More importantly, the empirical therapy upgradation in MRD positive cases may not be appropriate or adequate, particularly in those with poor molecular geneticprofile. PD-004 Insert Vincristine and Dexamethasone During the Maintenance Therapy of NonHigh Risk Pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia was Unnecessary: A Randomized Controlled Trial Study from Single Center L.B. Huang1, L. xuequn 1, K. ZhiYong1, T. HuiZhen1, Z. Xiaoli1 1the first affiliated hospital of SUMS, Pediatrics, Guangzhou, China Background/Objectives: The benefit of vincristine (VCR) plus dexamethasone (DXM) during maintenance in ALL is controversial. A multicenter clinical trial, GD2008 (NCT00846703), which is based on the ALL ICBFM 2002 protocol, was designed to evaluate the benefit of VCR and DXM pulses in the maintenance therapy. Here, we report the results from our single center. Design/Methods: 194 children, diagnosed with ALL with nonhighrisk features, were enrolled in our department from Aug 1, 2008 to Dec 31, 2014. All were treated with the same protocols based on the ALL ICBFM 2002 protocol, which included induction, consolidation, reinduction, and maintenance therapy. At the beginning of the maintenance therapy, those patients in complete remission were randomly assigned to either protocol A or protocol B. In protocol A, patients were given conventional 6mercaptopurine (6MP) and methotrexate (MTX). Patients in protocol B were given 6MP and MTX for 7 weeks, and then substituted by VCR and DXM for 1 week, and every 8 weeks as a cycle. The primary outcome measure was diseasefree survival. The study is registered at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov with the identifier NCT00846703. Results: 4 patients (2.1%) died during the therapy before randomization. Of the remaining 190 patients, 177 (93.1%) were randomly assigned: 93 to protocol A and 84 to protocol B. With median followup of 60 months, 10 children in protocol A and 17 in protocol B had relapses, and 1 child in the protocol A died of infection during maintenance treatment. The 5year eventfree survival (EFS) were 87.0%\u00b13.7% in protocol A and 78.9% \u00b14.8% in protocol B, respectively (p=0.126). The 5year overall survival (OS) were 94.1%\u00b12.6% in protocol A and 85.4%\u00b14.2% in protocol B, respectively (p=0.04). Conclusions: There are no benefits that intermit the MM maintenance therapy with vincristine and dexamethasone in children with nonhigh risk ALL who received chemotherapy based on BFM protocols. PD-005 Favorable Outcome of TCF3PBX1 Genetic Translocation in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in Chinese Children: CCLG2008 Study C. Li 1, L. Cui2, Z. Li2, Chai3, J.

Background/Objectives: TCF3PBX1 gene fusion happened in 35% of childhood ALL. In a prospective multicenter trial of Chinese Children Leukemia Group (CCLG) 2008 Study, patients were treated with standard BFMbased protocol. The outcome of this genetic subgroup was studied. Design/Methods: Newly diagnosed ALL patients were recruited from 10 hospitals in China from 04/2008 to 12/2012, 2231 patients were stratified into 3 risk groups according to age, WBC, genetic subtypes and 7day prednisone response. Two hospitals piloted MRD study by Flow and PCR with adjustment of treatment according to MRD response. TCFPBX1 group was assigned to intermediate risk (IR) at diagnosis. Results: There were 121 patients (5.4%) identified to be TCF3PBX1 positive by PCR and 41 also had t(1;19) on karyotyping. Mean age and WBC at diagnosis was 5.9 years and 42.2 x109/L, male to female was 68:53. At diagnosis, 3 patients had CNS 3 and 3 with CNS 2 status. Compared with 604 of other IR patients, TCF3PBX1 group had higher in 286 IR patients, MRD negativity (<0.01%) was significantly (63/237) p<0.001. BM but without any CNS relapse. Death occurred in 15 patients, 10 due to relapses and 5 due to infection. There was trend of better EFS for TCF3PBX1 group (87.1% vs 80.4%) but not significant (p=0.099). Conclusions: The incidence of TCF3PBX1 in Chinese children was 5.4% and CNS3 was only 2.5%, CNS relapse was not observed. The early response to treatment was better in TCF3PBX1 subset, and there was also trend of better survival. Supported by grants from National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 81200392 and 81170504) PD-006 Functional Mitochondrial Pediatrics Adolescent Medicine, Ulm, Germany; 2DanaFarber Cancer Institute, Medical Oncology, Boston, USA; 3Ulm University Medical Center, Internal Medicine III, Ulm, Germany Background/Objectives: In Bcell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCPALL), deficient cell death pathways are associated with treatment failure. Antiapoptotic BCL2 family proteins regulate apoptosis, thereby serving as targets for novel, directed therapies. The BCL2 inhibitor ABT199 binds to BCL2, leading to release of prodeath BCL2 family molecules and apoptosis induction. Here, we assessed the efficacy of ABT199 in BCPALL and investigated factors mediating ABT199 susceptibility or resistance, indicative of antileukemia activity. Design/Methods: ABT199 sensitivities were investigated in BCPALL (cell lines and patientderived xenografts). Expression of apoptosis regulators was detected by western blot analysis. MCL1 deficient leukemias were generated by CRISPR/Cas9. Mitochondrial apoptosis signaling was assessed BH3profiling. ABT199 antileukemia activity was evaluated in vivo. Results: The vast majority of BCPALL samples showed sensitivity to ABT199induced cell death in the nanomolar range. Interestingly, expression of the anti and proapoptotic regulators MCL1 and BCL2 were significantly associated with ABT199 knockout ABT199resistant leukemias resulted in sensitization, pointing to MCL1 as a mediator of ABT199 resistance. Next, we characterized the functional interplay of apoptosis regulators by BH3 profiling. Mitochondrial dependence on BCL2 was associated with ABT199 sensitivity, in contrast to low BCL2dependence and addiction to other regulators (BCLXL or MCL1) in ABT199resistant samples. Most importantly, in a preclinical in vivo setting in a xenograft mouse model, prolonged leukemiafree survival upon in vivo ABT199therapy was indicated by high mitochondrial BCL2dependence, in contrast to low BCL2dependence in ABT199 insensitive leukemias. Conclusions: Taken together, most of BCPALL show ABT199 sensitivity. However, ABT199 resistance occurs and is characterized by the level of the target molecule and counterplayers. Importantly, functional assessment of mitochondrial BCL2dependence (BH3profiles) is indicative of ABT199 sensitivity and antileukemia activity in vivo, providing a marker for the upfront identification of patients who would benefit from novel effective ALLtreatment strategies with Leukemia F. Gomes Andrade 1, I. Sardou Cezar1, Center, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Background/Objectives: Initiating somatic mutations detected in dried neonatal blood spots and in cord blood samples of affected children with leukemia have been proved to be acquired prenatally. However, few epidemiological studies have been carried out exploring infant acute myeloid leukemia (iAML) that include infants and children under 24 months of age at the diagnosis. Our aim was to describe the molecular characterization of iAML cases and investigate the contribution of gene mutations in the probability overall survival (pOS). Design/Methods: One hundred and seventyeight nonDown Syndrome cases with iAML were assessed throughout a multicentric network study. Mutations in hotspot regions of RAS pathway affecting genes (FLT3, NRAS, KRAS, PTPN11, and cKIT) were analyzed, with AML. The majority of patients was treated following the BFMAML2004, although out of clinical trials. Results: Eleven cases (6.2%) were congenital leukemia (1monthold), 80 (44.9%) were aged between 212 months old and 87 (48.9%) cases were aged 13 months old. The mostly morphological differentiation observed in blast cells was myelomonocytic (28.7%), monocytic (25.8%), and megakaryocytic (22.5%). All low white blood cell (WBC) count (50x109/L) at diagnosis, other than acute myelomonocytic leukemia. Frequent molecular abnormalities were KMT2Ar (34.6%), mainly KMT2AAFF1, followed by NUP98r (7.4%) and RUNX1RUNX1T1 (6.0%). RAS pathway gene mutations were observed in 30.1% of iAML, affecting mostly cases aged 13 months old and associated with KMT2Ar (29.7%). The cumulative 5year pOS was 33.8\u00b14.7%, with no statistical differences in survival rates among years or associated with molecular alterations. Conclusions: Despite presenting fewer genetic abnormalities than older pediatric AML, diseaserelated death rate was high in iAML. Our data indicate that diagnosis and management of iAML raise questions that should be considered for further action. PD-008 Molecular Characterization of Pediatric Acute Myeloid Leukemia: Results of a Diagnostic and National Multicentric Study in Brazil F. Gomes Andrade 1, E. Pereira Noronha1, F. C\u00e2ncer, Research Center, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Background/Objectives: The biological characterization of childhood acute myeloid leukemia (cAML) is an important outcome predictor. In Brazil, little is known about the frequency of AML subgroups, although cAML accounts for about 18% of leukemias. Aim. To investigate the contribution of type I and II gene mutations in the probability overall survival (pOS) of cAML in Brazil. Design/Methods: Seven hundred and three de novo pediatric AML cases (20002015) were assessed throughout a multicentric network study. Mutations in hotspot regions of FLT3, NRAS, KRAS, PTPN11, and cKIT genes were analyzed, as fusion genes (RUNX1RUNX1T1, MLL/KMT2Ar, CBFMYH11, and PMLRAR) associated with AML. Patients were treated out of the protocol, but the BFMAML2004 was followed since the year 2008. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) was treated differently. AML with Down syndrome was excluded. Results: There were significant differences in gene mutations between age ranges (2 yearsold; >210 years old and 11 years old) and the nonrandom association between type I/II mutations. Lower white blood cell count (50x109/L) was associated with RUNX1RUNX1T1 whereas higher WBC with CBFMYH11 (p<0.05). The cumulative pOS in 5 years was 37.5\u00b12.9% for total AMLs and 59.4\u00b17.2% for APL (p=0.03). pOS differences were observed between Brazilian regions. The SouthSoutheast regions had a better 5year pOS (47.6\u00b14.7%) whereas the NortheastMidwest regions presented the poorest pOS (23.7\u00b14.9%). PTPN11 mutations conferred adverse prognosis, as an independent prognostic factor. Conclusions: The identification of genetic subgroups contributes to the molecular epidemiology and biology of AML worldwide, reflecting the profile of pediatric AML cases in Brazil. Survival data for the specific cAML subtype in Latin countries are found rarely in the literature. Inclusion of cytogeneticmolecular markers in the characterization of AML are of great predictive value for OS. PD-009 Prognostic Impact of Hyperdiploidy in Pediatric Acute Myeloid Leukemia Patients S. Salem 1, S. Mahmoud2, S. Soliman3, K. Shaaban4, M. Hammad5, N. Elguindy6, Egypt, Cytogenetics, Cairo, Egypt; 2NCI Egypt and Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt, Pediatric Oncology, Cairo, Egypt; 3NCI Egypt and Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt, Hematolgy, Cairo, Egypt; 4NCI Egypt and Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt, Immunolgy, Cairo, Egypt; 5NCI Egypt and Children's Cancer Hospital Oncolgy, Cairo, Egypt; 6Children Cancer Hospital Egpyt 57357, Research, leukemia (AML) patients with hyperdiploid or triploid/tetraploid (TT) karyotype represent a relatively poorly understood entity. We aim to study the characteristics of this group as regards the karyotype, clinical and laboratory features and treatment outcome. Design/Methods: We retrospectively analyzed data of 447 patients with de novo AML who were treated in Children Cancer Hospital Egypt, 57357 on AML0431 COG adopted protocol, from July 2007 to January 2014. Patients with Down syndrome and acute promyelocytic leukemia were excluded. Results: Thirty four patients had 49 chromosomes. Seven cases with core binding factor translocation were excluded from analysis. Out of the 27 hyperdiploid and TT cases, 9 cases (33%) were AMLM7. Three cases had pure hyperdiploid karyotype.KMT2A gene rearrangement was found in 10 cases (37%), trisomy 8 in 11 cases (40.7%), gain of chromosome 21 in 16 cases (59%), and chromosome 5q abnormalities in 3 cases (11%). None of the patients had monosomy 7, t(6;9) or 17p/p53 deletion. Two patients died early in induction 1 and were excluded from further analysis. The two year overall survival was significantly lower (33%) compared to nonhyperdiploid KMT2A rearrangement, normal karyotype 69.5% and 76%, respectively The 2 year disease free survival for the hyperdiploid group was 35.5% while for nonhyperdiploid and inv(16), respectively. The cumulative incidence of relapse in the hyperdiploid group is 48.2 with CI (27.7 to 66). Conclusions: Hyperdiploid and TT karyotype is a rare and adverse risk abnormality in pediatric AML compared to other genetic groups. PD-010 Detection of Minimal Residual Disease in Down SyndromeAML by ErrorCorrected Sequencing: A MO, USA; 2The Hospital for Sick Children, Hematology/Oncology, Toronto ON, Canada; 3IWK Health Centre, Pediatrics, Halifax NS, Canada Background/Objectives: Down Syndrome (DS) neonates have a 1020fold higher incidence of acute myeloid leukemia (DSAML), which is characterized by mutations in exons 2 or 3 of GATA1 (Xp11.23) (Alford KA et al. Blood, 2011). Given the unstable surface immunophenotypes in this leukemia, there has never been a bona fide method for detecting minimal residual disease (MRD) following chemotherapy. Nextgeneration sequencing for GATA1 mutations would provide such a platform, however, is limited by a high errorrate (1:100). Errorcorrected sequencing (ECS) can circumvent this errorrate and detect mutations with a limit of detection of 1:10,000 (Young AL et al. Leukemia, 2015). In collaboration with the Children's Oncology Group (COG), we are applying ECS in parallel with flow cytometry to improve MRD detection in DSAML. Design/Methods: Exons 2 and 3 of were highfidelity PCR. The individualspecific barcode to enable sample multiplexing as well as a random 16bp index to allow for errorcorrection. ECS libraries were sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq and analyzed using published computational methods (Wong T et al. Nature, 2015). Results: To date, 51 samples from 30 DSAML patients enrolled on the COG AAML1531 study have been analyzed [diagnosis, n=29; End of Induction 1 (EOI1), n=22]. Nonsynonymous mutations were detected in 83% of diagnosis samples at an average variant allele frequency (VAF) of 0.1145 (range: 0.00101 in of samples at an average VAF of 0.0016 (range: 0.00003 - 0.01405). Conclusions: ECS is capable of both detecting and monitoring MRD in DSAML. Interestingly, we detect MRD in 53% of the paired EOI1 samples, yet DSAML patients have exceptionally high eventfree survival rates (80100%). This suggests that secondary events in addition to GATA1 mutations are involved in relapsed DSAML and are the focus of additional research. PD-011 TherapyRelated Acute Myeloid Leukemia/Myelodysplastic Syndrome Following Treatment for Childhood Cancer: Experience from a Tertiary Care Centre in North India C. VYAS 1, S. Jain1, G. Kapoor1 1Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute & Research centre New Delhi India, Department of Pediatric HaematologyOncology, Delhi, India Background/Objectives: Therapyrelated acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome (tAML/MDS) is a devastating complication of cancer treatment. In view of paucity of literature from India, we report the incidence, risk factors tAML/MDS over a period of 20 years at our institute. Design/Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of patients (18 years of age) treated in the pediatric hematologyoncology unit at our institute between January 1996 and December 2015. Amongst these, patients who developed tAML/MDS were identified. Information pertaining to primary malignancy, treatment details along with clinical, hematologic, cytogenetic features and outcome of tAML/MDS were obtained. Results: Amongst 1285 children, 8 patients developed t AML/MDS (6 males and 2 females, median age of 15.5 years) with a median latency period of 24 months. The incidence of tAML/MDS was [bone soft tissue (2)], BnonHodgkin lymphoma (2) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (2). The median cumulative equivalent doses of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and etoposide were mg/m2) and 2.5gm/ m2 (range, 14 gm/m2) respectively. Two patients received radiotherapy to the primary site. The dominant FAB morphology was M4/M5 (7/8) and cytogenetic abnormality was 11q23 translocation (4/8). Five patients opted for treatment and 4 achieved remission. Three patients died (2 toxic deaths and 1 relapse). Two patients are alive and disease free. The median survival was 5.5 months. Conclusions: We observed a high incidence of tAML/MDS in children with sarcoma compared to haematological malignancies. period and presence epipodophyllotoxin to be the probable causative agent. In view of poor outcome of tMDS/AML, strategies to identify host risk factors and to practise precision medicine need to be considered. Haematology Lymphomas PD-012 Outcome of Hodgkin Lymphoma in a Developing Country: The Children's Hospital Lahore Pakistan Experience A. Uddin1, F.S. Khan1, N. Asghar1 1The Children's oncology, Lahore, Pakistan Background/Objectives: The Children's Hospital a tertiary government centre with 60 paediatric Oncology beds. It receives over 1000 new cancer patients per year. The purpose of this study was to analyze treatment and outcome of children with biopsy proven Hodgkin Lymphoma and discuss various factors causing poor outcome as compared to developed countries. Design/Methods: Retrospective review of 315 patients enrolled between January 2011 June 2016 was done. Data regarding age, stage, histopathology, treatment, outcome and impact of delayed presentation were analyzed. Patients were treated according to EuronetPHLC1 protocol receiving 46 courses of OEPA/COPDAC. Results: Total 315 patients with age ranging from 2 to 15 (80% <10 yrs) were included. M: F Ratio was 5.7:1. 294/315(94%) presented with advanced stage and only 21(6%) had stage II at presentation. The histopathological examination showed Mixed Cellularity in 212/315(67%), Depletion in 6/315(2%) cases, whereas 27 (8%) reports did not specify the subtype. Bone marrow/lung was involved in 110/315 (35%) patients. Total 251/315 (80%) have completed treatment, 22/315 (7%) left against medical advice (LAMA) and 28/315 (9%) expired due to sepsis and progressive disease. 5/315 relapsed and 9/315 had progressive disease (4%) Conclusions: Survival is good 251/315 (80%) for the whole group (70% in 2014 ISCAYAHL data) Mortality of 11% can be reduced by early diagnosis and aggressive infection control measures. In developing countries, late referrals are strongly associated with metastatic disease. The prognosis can significantly be improved by public awareness to seek early treatment and establishing safe and effective shared care oncology pathways, multidisciplinary team approach. By providing strong social support, intense psychosocial counseling and efficiently run Day Care Oncology can help increase patients compliance. PD-013 Second Biopsy of Residual Mass in Pediatric Mature BCell NonHodgkin Lymphoma: Benefit Patients or Not? M. Cai 1 1Shanghai Children's Medical Center Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Med, Pediatric Hematology & Oncology, ShangHai, China Background/Objectives: The reliable assessment of residual masses remains a diagnostic problem in patients with nonHodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The objective of this study was to assess the impact of secondlook biopsy of residual mass during or after chemotherapy in pediatric mature Bcell NHL. Design/Methods: Patients with mature Bcell NHL who were suspicious of residual mass at mid or end of treatment and subjected to second biopsy were treated and followed at our medical center between 2001 and 2015. Their clinical characteristics, imagings, pathology, treatment and prognosis were reviewed retrospectively. Results: A total of 31 children were included. Twentytwo with Burkitt lymphoma, 6 with Diffuse large B cell lymphoma and 3 with Bcell lymphoma, unclassified. Median age at diagnosis was 6.1 years (2.514 years). The median time from diagnosis to second biopsy was 3.15 months (2.318 months). Biopsy confirmed the presence of viable tumor in 8 patients. The specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) of conventional imaging in detecting residual disease were poor, at 9% and 28.6%. Three of the histologic positive patients experienced progressive disease or relapse while the others achieved complete remission (CR) at the completion of therapy and 21 patients achieved longtime CR at a median followup of 3.2 years (1 year7 years). The median progressionfree survival (PFS) time was 28 months (584 months) and 5year PFS rate was 90.0%. 5year PFS rate of negativebiopsy of positivebiopsy group was 62.5%. (P=0.002<0.05) Conclusions: Residual mass is not uncommon in children with mature Bcell NHL. An integrated tactics is important for the accurate determination of residual disease. Conventional imaging has low specificity and PPV. Secondlook biopsy is necessary to differentiate viable tumor from necrosis or fibrosis and is solid evidencebased foundation of subsequent treatment. It also can help clinician to avoid overtreatment and to predict prognosis. PD-014 AHOPCA LH 2004: Treatment of High Risk Hodgkin Lymphoma in LMIC: Drug Availability and Logn Term Outcomes S. 1, Castellanos2, E. Alarcon11 Surgery University of MilanoBicocca, Center of Biostatistics for Clinical Epidemiology, Milan, Italy; 10School of Medicine and Surgery University of MilanoBicocca, Biostatistics for Clinical Epidemiology, Milan, Israel; 11University of Illinois College of Medicine and St Jude Midwest Affiliate, Department of Pediatrics, Peoria, USA Background/Objectives: High risk Hodgkin lymphoma in children is curable with chemotherapy and radiation. Multiple chemotherapeutic drugs are often not available for purchase by lowmiddle income countries (LMIC). AHOPCA implemented a modified treatment guideline with the aim to reduce abandonment while conserving survival. Design/Methods: 239 patients with high risk Hodgkin lymphoma (IIB, IIIB, IV) were diagnosed from August 2004September 2009 and followedup to March 2017. Costa Rica (n=20), El Salvador (n=30), Guatemala (n=87), Honduras (n=50), Nicaragua (n=39) and Dominican Republic (n=13) contributed to this report. All patients were staged with ultrasound or computer tomography. Chemotherapy regimen was a modified StanfordV, substituting cyclophosphamide for mechlorethamine. Response evaluation was performed after 12 weeks of chemotherapy All patients received either 2000cGy for a CR and 2500cGy for PR to involvedfield radiation therapy (IFRT). Results: 192 patients eligible and evaluable were enrolled. Median followup time was 7.6 years; 152 were boys, median age was 9 years (2.617.5 years), 47 were IIB, 88 IIIB and 57 IV; 106 finished therapy. 43 did not get IFRT due to death (n=7), abandonment (n=28, (PD, n=8); 28% (42/149) got IFRT later than 6 weeks after end of chemotherapy without affecting outcome. Overall, 34 patients had PD, 29 relapsed, 8 died and 28 abandoned. 8year abandonmentsensitive EFS and OS for the whole cohort was (\u00b1SE) and 56%\u00b13.8; IIIB and IV stages. Conclusions: Treatment abandonment remains as an important failure (14% vs 12%, p=0.242). As previously described, substituting cyclophosphamide for mechlorethamine in StanfordV did not bring the expected results. The OS for earlier stages was better than stage IV. Substitution of drugs in LMIC, related to availability is dangerous and affects the outcome. A new regimen with available drugs is now implemented. Advocacy and compliance of drug availability are needed. PD-015 ClinicoEpidemiological Profile and Outcome of Pediatric Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (ALCL): Single Center Experience from India N. Pradhan 1, D. Philip2, G. Narula1, M. Oncology, Memorial Centre, Medical Oncology, Mumbai, India Background/Objectives: ALCL is a rare form of NHL in children. We evaluated the clinical, epidemiological profile and outcome of pediatric ALCL patients at Tata Memorial Center, Mumbai, India. Design/Methods: This is a retrospective study of 10 years data of ALCL patients, who were registered at our centre from 01/01/2005 to 31/12/2014. All patients who were treated at our centre received based alternating regimens of 8 cycles with 6 intrathecal Cytarabine and 8 intrathecal Methotrexate, followed by oral 6Mercaptopurine and Methotrexate maintenance therapy (Six months for stage 1 and 2 disease and one year for stage 3 and 4 disease). Results: We include 68 patients (<15 years) of ALCL. The male to female ratio was 3.5:1. Number of patients having Stage1,2,3 and 4 disease at were 6(8.8%), 7(10.3%), 39(57.3%) and 16(23.5%) respectively. Fortythree (63.2%) patients had Bsymptoms at presentation. The common sites of disease involvement were lymph nodes (85.3%), bone (29.4%), bonemarrow (23.5%) and had ALKpositive disease on immunohistochemistry. For outcome analysis details of 4 patients were not available. Out remaining 64, complete remission (CR) was achieved in 55(85.9%), 4(6.2%) achieved partial response (PR) while 5(7.8%) had progressive disease. Six (9.3%) patients relapsed, of which 3 achieved second remission and are alive in CR at last followup. Five (7.8%) patients died in remission. Thirteen (20.3%) died due to disease, all had advanced stage (3/4). Threeyear EFS and OS were 67.5% and 72.7% respectively at a median followup 40 months (1132). Conclusions: Pediatric ALCL has reasonable outcome with Vinblastin based multiagent chemotherapy. Advanced stage disease is associated with higher risk of mortality, and requires innovative therapies. PD-016 Impact of Secondary Chromosomal Abnormalities on Treatment Outcome in Pediatric Burkitt Leukemia S. Salem 1, H. Abdelrahman2, M. Tantawy3, S. Talaat2, R. Mohey4 1NCI Egypt and Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt, Clinical Pathology, Cairo, Egypt; 2NCI Egypt and Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt, Pediatric Oncology, Cairo, Egypt; 3Children Cancer Hospital Egypt, Clinical Pathology, Cairo, Egypt; 4Children Cancer Hospital Egypt, Research Department, Cairo, Egypt Background/Objectives: Burkitt leukemia (BL) is characterized by translocation of the MYC gene to one of the immunoglobulin genes. The clinical significance of secondary chromosomal abnormalities associated with this characteristic translocation remains unknown. We aim to analyze the impact of secondary chromosomal abnormalities on treatment outcome in pediatric BL. Design/Methods: Patients with BL presenting to Children Cancer Hospital in Egypt57357 (CCHE) from July 2007 till March 2015, were reviewed for karyotyping and MYC status by FISH. These results were correlated with survival analysis. Results: Eightyeight patients with BL were diagnosed and treated according to the FAB/LMB 96 protocol. Majority were males (78%) and above 10 years of age at presentation (43%). Associated central nervous system involvement was diagnosed in 33% of the patients. Informative karyotype for 67 patients demonstrated translocation of the MYC and IGH genes in 85% of patients while translocation of the IGK and IGL were found in 3% and 12%, respectively. Secondary chromosomal abnormalities were detected in 60% of patients. Duplication of chromosome 1q was found in 17 patients, followed by chromosome 14q abnormalities (6 patients), chromosome 6q deletion (4 patients), and chromosome 13q deletion (3 patients). The five year OS was 57.5%, while the 5 year EFS was 51.6% of the whole group. After excluding 24 patients with treatment related mortality, relapse or tumor progression on chemotherapy was seen in 16 patients. The 3 years relapse free survival in patients with complex karyotype was 47.1%, while in patients having noncomplex karyotype it was 76.8% (pvalue=0.022). Conclusions: The frequency of secondary chromosomal abnormalities in our series is in concordance with other publications with duplication 1q being the most common, followed by deletion 6q, 13q, and 17p. Complex karyotype was significantly associated with higher incidence of relapse and poor outcome. Haematology Stem Cell Transplantation (Haematological Diseases/Technique and Supportive Care) PD-017 Effect of Activating KIRLigand Match on the Outcome of Pediatric Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Y.B. Choi 1, L. Ji Won2, Y. Keon Hee2, K. EunSuk3, S. Ki Woong2, K. Hong Hoe2 1ChungAng University Hospital, Pediatrics, Seoul, Republic of Korea; 2Samsung Medical Center, Pediatrics, Seoul, Republic of Korea; 3Samsung Medical Center, Laboratory Medicine and Genetics, Seoul, Republic of Korea Background/Objectives: Natural killer (NK) cells are precisely controlled by a network of activating and inhibiting signals through surface receptors. In this study, we evaluated the impact of KIR genotype on the outcome following allogeneic HSCT for malignant disease in children. Design/Methods: The donor's activating KIR and recipient's KIR ligand (KIRL match) were considered compatible if the donor had one or more activating receptors for which the cognate ligand was present in the recipient. KIR2DS1, KIR2DS2, KIR2DS4, and KIR3DS1 were deemed activating KIRs. The donors were classified as KIR haplotype A or B donors according to their gene content. Haplotype A donors were defined as individuals only possessing genes of the group A KIR haplotypes. All individuals possessing having one or more haplotype Bspecific genes were defined as haplotype B donors. Results: Fiftythree patients received allogeneic HSCT from siblings (n = 11), unrelated donors (n = 20), or haploidentical donors (n = 22) between January 2011 and December 2014. The transplants were performed in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (n = 17), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 14), neuroblastoma (n = 17), and other solid tumors (n = 5). Twentyeight donorrecipient pairs had a KIRL match and the remaining twentyfive donorrecipient pairs had a mismatch. The 2year relapsefree was 72.3 \u00b1 9.0% recipients with a KIRL match and 42.9 \u00b1 10.1% in recipients with a KIRL mismatch (P = 0.043). Recipients who received HSCT from haplotype B donors had no survival benefit compared to those who received HSCT from haplotype A donors (60.6 allogeneic HSCT with activating KIRL match decreased relapse and improved relapsefree survival. Therefore, for a successful HSCT outcome, KIR genotyping should be performed before selection of NK cell alloreactive donors. Solid Non Brain Tumours Neuroblastoma PD-018 Spinal Canal Invasion in Peripheral Neuroblastic Tumors A Siopen Prospective Study Registry S. Ash 1, R. Haupt2, K. Kraal3, D. Plantaz4, A. Wiecrorek5, Bernardi12, Oncology, Poland; 6Federal Scientific and Clinical Center of Pediatric Hematology, Department of Clinical Oncology, Moscow Russian Federation, Russia; Children's Hospital, Pediatric Oncology, Dublin, Ireland; 8Astrid Hospital, Childhood Cancer Research Unit, Stockholm, Sweden; 9Great Ormond Street Hospital for Background/Objectives: Spinal canal invasion (SCI) occurs in 1015% of children with peripheral neuroblastic tumors (PNTs). These patients have favorable clinical and biologic features and are cured more often than other patients, but are especially prone to develop late neurologic, functional and orthopedic sequelae. The question of their optimal treatment has not been solved yet. The prospective SIOPEN Study Registry aims to collect data on these patients with the aim 1) to increase the knowledge on natural history of PNTs presenting with SCI, 2) to evaluate the combined effects of different risk factors on their outcome and 3) to ultimately develop common treatment guidelines. Design/Methods: This SIOPEN Study intends to collect clinical, biological, therapeutic and followup data on symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with PNT and SCI. A minimum of 150 patients are expected. Age adjusted, standardized tools for symptoms grading and functional impacts are the CTCAE, FLACC, pain scores and ASIA scales. Results: From June 2014 to February 2017, a total of 57 patients have been registered from 8 countries. Median age is 17 months, M/F ratio is 0.8. The most common histology is NB poorly differentiated. Three patients only had MYCN gene amplification. Twentyeight patients were symptomatic. Symptoms included motor deficit in 21, pain in 15 and bladder & bowel function in 2. Primary tumour site was located in the thorax in 18, in the thoraco/abdominal site in 11. The majority (63%) have L2 disease. Patients were treated according to SIOPEN/institutional protocols. Median followup is 6 months. At 2 months from diagnosis, pain disappear in all patients presenting this symptom, while motor deficit persists in 5 of 17 patients available for response. Conclusions: This is the first cooperative study designed to collect data to evaluate the combined effects of different risk factors on neurologic, functional and orthopedic outcome of PNT's patients presenting 4Bellvitge Institute for Biomedical Research, Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program, Barcelona, Spain Background/Objectives: All induction treatment regimens for patients with neuroblastoma contain chemotherapeutics that cause double strand DNA breaks. BRCA1 is a tumor suppressor gene, and is involved in the repair of these double strand breaks in the DNA. Here we study the effects of BRCA1 expression on tumor progression and chemoresistance in neuroblastoma. Design/Methods: performed an Illumina 450K methylation tumor samples, and sought for differentially methylated CpGs between high risk and low risk tumors. MTT assays were performed to study the effect of target gene methylation on chemoresistance. And shRNA knock down was utilized to investigate the tumor driving effects of target gene expression. Results: BRCA1 was found to be the top hit with 15 significantly differentially methylated CpG between high risk and low risk neuroblastoma. This is surprising, since BRCA1 is known as a bonafide tumor suppressor gene. In neuroblastoma however, this gene seems to function as a tumor driver. Hypomethylation of BRCA1 is strongly correlated with high BRCA1 expression. shRNA knockdown of BRCA1 led to increased DNA damage and cell death in cell lines with high BRCA1 expression. We hypothesized that BRCA1 hypomethylation, would lead to resistance to chemotherapeutics since the induced double strand breaks would be efficiently repaired. Indeed, cell lines with BRCA1 hypomethylation show resistance against widely used chemotherapeutics. Conclusions: BRCA1 hypomethylated in high risk neurblastoma tumors. Knockdown of BRCA1 leads to DNA damage and cell death in cell lines depending on BRCA1, suggesting that BRCA1 is essential for tumor progression in BRCA1 hypomethylated tumors. BRCA1 hypomethylation was shown to cause resistance to chemotherapeutics, indicating that BRCA1 hypomethylation might be involved in therapy resistance of patients with high risk neuroblastoma. PD-020 MGMT Inhibitor O6Benzylguanine Enhanced the Activity of Temozolomide + Irinotecan against in Vitro and in Vivo Models of Progressive Disease HighRisk Neuroblastoma A. Reynolds1 1Texas University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, USA Background/Objectives: Patients with highrisk neuroblastoma (NB) treated have clinical activity in relapse/refractory NB. We hypothesized that DNA repair genes with increased expression in alkylatorresistant NB models would provide potential therapeutic targets for enhancing chemotherapy. Design/Methods: TaqMan Low Density Arrays (TLDA) were used to analyze mRNA expression of 62 DNA repair genes in 9 alkylatorresistant and 4 alkylatorsensitive cell lines. Genes with differential expression were validated in an expanded NB cell line panel (n=26) by qRTPCR. In vitro cytotoxicity was assayed using the digital imaging microscopy scanning system (DIMSCAN). Double strand DNA breaks, apoptosis, and DNA fragmentation were assessed using phospohistone H2AX, cleaved caspase3, and TUNEL, respectively. In vitro metabolite of IRN. Subcutaneous patientderived xenografts (PDXs) IRN, and O6benzylguanine (O6BG) via oral gavage, tail Results: and by qRTPCR growth and increased median survival (p<0.05) relative to TMZ+IRN in COGN564x and COGN452x PDXs established at the time of death from progressive disease. Conclusions: High MGMT expression is associated with neuroblastoma multidrug resistance. MGMT inhibitor 06BG synergistically enhanced the activity of TMZ+IRN both in vitro and in vivo with clinically achievable dosing. Further studies evaluating MGMT as a therapeutic target in recurrent highrisk neuroblastoma are warranted. PD-021 Exploring the relevance of Primary Tumour 123IMIBG Response to Induction Chemotherapy with Rapid COJEC in Children with HighRisk Neuroblastoma E. Szychot 1, O. Arthurs2, N. P. Humphries2, L. Biassoni last author 2, D. Morgenstern last author 4 1Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation and Haematology, London, United Kingdom; Ormond Street Foundation Trust, Radiology, London, United Kingdom; 3Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust, Pathology, London, United Kingdom; 4Hospital for Sick Children, Paediatric Oncology, Toronto, Canada Background/Objectives: Assessment of metastatic response by 123ImIBG scintigraphy is important for treatment decisions in management of patients with highrisk neuroblastoma (HRNBL). However, the relevance of primary tumour mIBG response has not been explored. We aimed to compare clinical and histological (percentage of viable tumour) characteristics of primary mIBGavid tumours that became entirely mIBGnonavid after induction chemotherapy (IC) with primary mIBGavid tumour that remained mIBGavid (nonresponders). Design/Methods: Retrospective review of patients with metastatic HRNBL (>18 months at diagnosis) treated at Great Ormond Street Hospital 20052016. Patients received Rapid COJEC (multiagent IC as per SIOPEN HRNBL1). Patients who did not go on to have surgery after IC alone were excluded. Postsurgical histopathology specimens were assessed for percentage of viable tumour. Primary tumour mIBG response was assessed qualitatively as positive, negative, or intermediate. mIBG uptake was assessed at diagnosis and after IC. Estimates of eventfree survival (EFS) using KaplanMeier and comparisons by logrank test. Results: Seven of 68 (10.3%) patients had mIBG-negative tumours at diagnosis and were excluded. 16 of 61 patients showed complete primary tumour mIBG response, 20 partial response and 25 no response. There was no statistically significant difference between clinical demographics of responders and nonresponders. Primary tumour mIBG response did not correlate with extent of metastatic mIBGavid disease at diagnosis. Mean percentage viable tumour cells was significantly greater in mIBGnonresponders than responders (44.6% vs 20.6%; p=0.05). 5year EFS was significantly better responders than nonresponders (43\u00b115% vs 7\u00b16%; p<0.005). 5year EFS was better in patients whose tumours showed <10% viable tumour after IC compared to those 10% tissue (77\u00b112% vs 25\u00b110%, p= 0.007). Conclusions: Primary mIBG response correlates with tumour necrosis and patient outcome. However, it is not sufficient alone to be used to confirm complete necrosis and justify a decision not to resect these tumours. PD-022 A Key Role for EMT Transcription Factor SNAI2 in Neuroblastoma Dissemination and Response to Retinoic Acid Therapy K. Vrenken 1, J. Middelbeek1, D. Van Ingen Schenau1, Y. Derks1, Van Leeuwen1 Laboratory of Pediatric Oncology/ Pediatrics, nijmegen, The Netherlands Background/Objectives: Despite intensive treatment close to 50% of patients with highrisk neuroblastoma relapse. Recurrent disease is characterized by poorly differentiated, therapy resistant cells. Retinoic Acid (RA)induced differentiation improves eventfree survival, but many patients fail to respond. Hence, we aim to identify novel therapeutic targets that enhance the sensitivity to RA and promote neuroblastoma differentiation. The similarities between neural crest development and neuroblastoma progression provide an appealing starting point. During neural crest development the transcriptional program epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT) drives cellular plasticity affecting migration, selfrenewal and pluripotency. We hypothesize that a similar mechanism maintains neuroblastoma cells in a poorly differentiated state. Therfore, targeting EMT may overcome therapy resistance. Design/Methods: By gene expression profiling we investigated the association of EMT transcription factors with neuroblastoma overall survival. Subsequently, we used a variety of different in vitro methods, including 3D spheroid invasion assays, to study the effects of CRISPRCAS9 mediated knockout of the EMT transcription factor SNAI2 on neuroblastoma differentiation and the response to RA. In addition, immunocompromised mice were used to identify the effect of SNAI2 knockout on in vivo colonization. Results: Expression of EMT transcription factors associate with neuroblastoma disease progression. Moreover, coregulation of genes that are directly controlled by SNAI2 is highly predictive of disease outcome in two independent neuroblastoma patient cohorts, supporting the idea that increased SNAI2 activity contributes to neuroblastoma progression. Consistently, knockout of SNAI2 promotes cellular differentiation, while reducing self renewal capacity, invasion into a 3D matrix and in vivo colonization. In addition, growth of SNAI2 knockout cells is strongly inhibited by RA treatment and accompanied by enhanced tumor cell differentiation. Conclusions: In summary, our results identify SNAI2 as a key player in regulating neuroblastoma differentiation and response to RA. Future research will focus on how EMT regulatory networks can be effectively targeted to enhance therapy response in patients with advanced neuroblastoma.

Design/Methods: From January 2003 to December 2013, 55 patients (median age 3.3 years; 29 males, 26 females) with advanced Wilms tumor were treated with preoperative TACE and systemic chemotherapy. Characteristics of patients were tumor diameter greater than 10 cm, involvement of periaortic lymph nodes, tumor thrombus in inferior vena cava/right with vindesine, ifosfamide and actinomycin D or etoposide was administered 3 weeks after TACE. Nephrectomy was performed 2-3 weeks after preoperative therapy. Postoperative radiation therapy and chemotherapy were based on tumor histology and surgical stage. Results: No cardiotoxicity, renal and hepatic dysfunction after neoadjuvant therapy were found. Grade - marrow suppression developed in 12 (21.8%) patients. In terms of response evaluation criteria, PR in 34 (61.8%), SD in 19 (34.5%), and PD in 2 (3.6%) patients were observed. Distant metastasis disappeared in four of six cases. All patients underwent tumor resection after preoperative therapy. Complete surgical removal of the tumor was achieved in 50 (90.1%) patients. The 5year EFS and years (range, 3.514.0 years). Conclusions: Neoadjuvant TACE combined with systemic chemotherapy provide a promising choice for treatment of advanced Wilms tumor. PD-024 NephronSparing Surgery for Bilateral Wilms Tumour: Risk Factors for Positive Resection Margins A. Mantovani1, Brok2, L. Calciano3, surgery(NSS) for bilateral tumour(BWT) is a balance between complete tumourexcision and maximal preservation of renal parenchyma. This study explores the risk factors for incomplete resection and its oncological impact. Design/Methods: Retrospective review of patients with BWT treated at Great Ormond Street Hospital (Aug'01Dec'16). Patient demographics, imaging, treatment, surgery, histology and clinical outcome were recorded. Lesions' diameter, volume, number, location, distance from vessels, and type of NSS were assessed by multivariable logistic regression(Stata 14\u00ae) for their association with incomplete resection, and effect on mortality, relapse and treatment burden. Results: Fiftyfour patients, mean age 31(8129) months(m) at surgery, received 72 NSS (excising 108 lesions) and 45 total nephrectomies(TN). All but 2 patients had preoperative chemotherapy as per the SIOP2001 protocol. Followup data were available for 52 patients: At mean of 68m (range 6182m) after surgery, diseasefree, 5(10%) had mean 45m(1190m) postsurgery: 6(12%) patients were in endstagerenaldisease after 3 bilateral TN and 3 completion nephrectomy for 2 recurrences and 1infarction (3 dialysis, 2 renal transplant, 1 diedmetastatic progression), 5(10%) patients had hypertension and elevated creatinine, 4(8%) hypertension, 25(48%) elevated creatinine alone and 18(35%) patients had normal renal parameters. Positive margins (M+) occurred in 30%(16/35) patients for 35 lesions (10 TN (35%) 11 blastema, 1.072.64) were associated with M+. significantly increased the risk of flank/abdominal radiotherapy(OR 5.29, 1.8215.32) and intensified 4drug chemotherapy(OR 3.45, 1.0511.3) but did not significantly increased risk of relapse or death. Conclusions: Multiple lesions and tumorectomy compared to partial nephrectomy were associated with M+ in patients with BWT. M+ increases treatment burden and risk of late effects. Solid Non Brain Tumours Bone Tumours PD-025 Mifamurtide Manzo1, D. Di Pinto2, E. Pota2, C. Campania \"Luigi Vanvitelli\", Woman Child and General and Specialist Surgery, Naples, Italy Background/Objectives: The process of osteoblast precursor dedifferentiation causes osteosarcoma, the most common tumor of the childhood. In contrast to most other tumor types, TAMs (tumorassociated macrophages), that are M2 polarized macrophages, reduce metastasis and improve survival in highgrade osteosarcoma patients. The mifamurtide is an immunomodulatory drug given together with standard adjuvant chemotherapy in highgrade osteosarcoma to improve outcome. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of mifamurtide in the macrophage polarization and in the modulation of the dedifferentiation of osteosarcoma cell line MG63. Design/Methods: Macrophages, obtained from peripheral blood mononucleated cells of healthy subjects, and activated or not with mifamurtide [100M] were collected or cocultured with MG63 cells. By biomolecular (qPCR) and biochemical (Western blotting, ELISA) analyses, we evaluated the effects of mifamurtide on: M1 markers Mifamurtideactivated macrophages show a significant reduction of both the M1 polarization marker INOS and the M2 polarization marker CD206, and a significant increase of both proinflammatory (IL1, IL6) and antiinflammatory (IL4, IL10) cytokines. Moreover, they show a significant increase of the iron transporter DMT1, according to an increased iron uptake typical of the M1 phenotype, and a significant increase (more than 7 folds) of the iron release, according to a M2 polarization. MG63 cells cocultured with mifamurtideactivated macrophages show a significant increase of the osteoblast markers RUNX2 and OPG and a significant reduction of RANKL. Moreover, they show a significant reduction of the proliferation and of the STAT3 activation that several tumors, instead, constitutively activate. Conclusions: Collectively, these data suggest that mifamurtide, switching macrophage polarization towards a TAMlike intermediate M1/M2 phenotype, and reducing STAT3 activation, inhibits the cellular proliferation and induces the tumor cell dedifferentiation. PD-026 Impact of NeoAdjuvant Chemotherapy Dose Intensity on Outcomes of Children with Localized Osteosarcoma: Experience of Children's Cancer Hospital - 57357 Egypt (CCHE) M. Zamzam 1, A. Hassaan2, R. Soliman3, N. Kamal4, S. Ahmed1 1Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt CCHE/National Cancer Institute Cairo University, Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Cairo, Egypt; 2Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt CCHE, Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Cairo, Egypt; 3Children's cancer Hospital 57357 Egypt, Health Economics and Outcomes, Cairo, Egypt; 4Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt CCHE, Research, Cairo, Egypt Background/Objectives: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy for osteosarcoma is the standard of care, but there is still confusion regarding the optimal dose intensity. This retrospective study aimed to determine the impact of neoadjuvant chemotherapy dose intensity on tumor necrosis and the outcomes of children with localized osteosarcoma at CCHE. Design/Methods: Dose intensity (DI) was determined by calculating the total dose of each drug (Methotrexate, Doxorubicin and Cisplatin) divided by the time duration in weeks. Relative dose intensity (RDI) was calculated by dividing the delivered DI by the standard DI as per CCHE Osteosarcoma protocol. The impact of chemotherapy RDI on histological response was determined using logistic regression. RDI was also correlated with the 5year relapsefree survival (RFS) at a cutoff point of 75% of the DI using log rank test. Cox regression was done for multivariate analysis. Results: One hundred and three patients (< 18 years old) with localized Osteosarcoma presented to 57357 hospital from 2009 until 2014 and were followedup until June 2016. Seventytwo patients (70%) were poor responders, while thirtyone patients (30%) showed good response. The histological response was affected by chemotherapy RDI (logistic regression, P = 0.03). Overall survival was 78%, while RFS was 62.7%. Patients who received the drugs in the neoadjuvant phase at RDI above 75% showed improved 5year RFS which was 80.7%, while those who received <75% showed RFS of 57.5% (Pvalue = 0.04). Patients with good histological response showed RFS of 84.8%, while poor responders showed RFS of 52.8% (Pvalue= 0.001). Upon multivariate analysis, histological response maintained significance (P = 0.007), while RDI lost significance (P = 0.129). Conclusions: The relative dose intensity is a good predictor of histologic response, which has a great impact on the relapse free survival. Therefore, it is recommended to deliver optimal dose intensity to achieve better outcomes. PD-027 LongTerm Outcome of EpiphysealPreservation and Biological Reconstruction Using TumorBone Sterilized with Liquid Nitrogen for Childhood Osteosarcoma Around the Knee H. Tsuchiya 1, A. Takeuchi1, N. Yamamoto1, K. Hayashi1, H. Aiba1, Y. Araki1 1Kanazawa University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Orthopaedic Surgery, Kanazawa, Japan Background/Objectives: Various methods exist to reconstruct large bone defects after tumor excision such as tumor prostheses or biological reconstructions using allograft, autograft, or recycled tumorbearing bone. In 1999, we developed a reconstruction method using tumorbearing autograft treated by liquid nitrogen. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcome of this technique for treating osteosarcoma around the knee in children after epiphyseal sparing tumor resections. Design/Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 17 children (7 boys and 10 girls) with osteosarcoma around the knee with an average age of 12 years (range 616). The mean followup period was 49 months (range 1987). In 11 cases, the lesion was in the distal femur, while in 6 patients it was in the proximal tibia. Two distinct freezing techniques - resection and freezing (11 cases) and pedicle freezing (6 cases) - were used based on the location of the tumor. Complications and oncological outcomes were evaluated and graded using the Musculoskeletal Tumour Society (MSTS) scoring system. Results: The mean MSTS score was 95% (range 63100). Complications that required additional surgery were observed in 7 (41.2%) patients. The 7 complications consisted of 4 fractures, 2 local recurrences arising from the surrounding soft tissue, and one superficial infection managed by irrigation and IV antibiotics. Limb shortening (>3 cm) was observed in 6 patients; 2 of these patients underwent subsequent limb lengthening. One frozenautograft (5.9%) was surgically retrieved to manage the soft tissue recurrence. Clinically, 14 patients were able to run normally. Final oncological status was CDF in 13, NED in 3, and DOD in 1. Conclusions: The longterm outcome of epiphysealpreservation surgery using tumorbone sterilized with liquid nitrogen for childhood osteosarcoma around the knee was satisfactory and promising. This procedure proved to be very beneficial for children with osteosarcoma. Solid Non Brain Tumours Soft Tissue Sarcomas PD-028 Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumor (DSRCT): Outcomes of Curative Intent Multimodality Treatment N. Khanna 1, A. Nayak1, G. Chinnaswamy2, Memorial Hospital, Medical Oncology, Mumbai, India; Memorial Mumbai, India; 4Tata Memorial Hospital, Radiology, Mumbai, India; 5Tata Memorial Hospital, Nuclear Medicine, Mumbai, India; 6Tata Memorial Hospital, Surgical Oncology, Mumbai, India Background/Objectives: DSRCT is a rare and aggressive mesenchymal neoplasm. We evaluated the clinicpathological profile, treatment response, patterns of failure and prognostic factors for patients with DSRCT treated at the Tata Memorial Hospital (TMH). Design/Methods: Between April 2006 & November 2016, 48 patients with histologically proven DSRCT in the age group of 679 yrs (Median 27 yrs) were treated at TMH. Thirty eight (79%) were males. Majority (85%) had abdominopelvic disease. Metastatic disease at presentation was seen in 50%. The commonest site being liver (71%). Curative treatment was offered to 24 (50%) patients. Local treatment was cytoreductive surgery (CRS) alone in 10 patients, CRS followed by adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) in 7 patients and 3 patients received RT alone. One patient underwent hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) after CRS. Four patients progressed on induction chemotherapy and hence, did not undergo local treatment. Results: After a median followup of 14 months, the progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was 29% and 67% respectively. At last follow up, only 7 (29%) were alive and disease free. On univariate analysis, patients who were offered local treatment in the form of CRS with or without RT had improved OS (75% Vs 25%, p<0.05). Superior OS was seen in patients in whom complete cytoreduction was achieved (90% Vs 50%, p=0.04). At the time of relapse most patients had disseminated disease. Five patients developed severe treatment related toxicities. Conclusions: DSRCT is associated with poor outcome. Local treatment in the form of complete CRS or complete CRS followed by adjuvant RT confers best outcome. PD-029 Mutation of Ras Pathway Should be a Target of Precision Medicine for Rhabdomyosarcoma N. nakagawa 1, K. Kikuchi1, K. Nakamura1, T. Sakai3, H. 1Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Pediatrics, Kyoto, Japan; 2Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Pediatric Surgery, Kyoto, Japan; 3Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, MolecularTargeting Cancer Prevention, Kyoto, Japan Background/Objectives: One of the current strategies for adult malignant tumor is precision medicine based on individual gene mutation. Despite the advances in therapy, the outcome of recurrent or metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) remains poor, and treatment related side effects are still a problem. Embryonal RMS (ERMS) is reported to be a heterogeneous tumor that displays various gene mutations. Investigations of the heterogeneity could contribute to the development of precision medicine for ERMS. CH5126766 is a potent and selective dual RAF/MEK inhibitor. In this study, we examined the activity of CH5126766 in RMS tumor cell lines with/without RAS mutation. Design/Methods: Human RMS RH41, RMSYM, and SCMCRM2, were used in this study. RAS pathway mutations in the cell lines were identified by direct sequencing. Cell survival was evaluated by WST8 assay. The cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry, and apoptosis was detected using flow cytometry after appropriate staining with Annexin V. ERK phosphorylation and RB dephosphorylation were analyzed by immunoblotting. Results: CH5126766 inhibited growth of cells with RAS mutations and did not affect the cells that lacked RAS pathway mutations. Cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase was induced in RMS cell lines with RAS mutations within 24 h of exposure to pharmacological levels of CH5126766. In the immunoblotting analyses, the drug appeared to suppress ERK phosphorylation in all the cells, but it was found to induce RB dephosphorylation in RAS mutated cells. Conclusions: CH5126766 is a promising therapeutic option for molecular targeting of RAS mutated RMS. Our results suggest that the precision medicine approach targeting individual variability in genes could be an effective therapeutic strategy for RMS. PD-030 Peritoneal Pleuropulmonary Blastoma: A New Manifestation of DICER1 Syndrome K.A. Schultz 1, M. Wilhelm1, G. Williams1, A. Field2, J. Jarzembowski3, Blood Disorders, Minneapolis MN, USA; 2Children's National Medical Center, Pathology, Washington DC, USA; 3Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, Pathology, Milwaukee WI, USA; 4Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Pathology, Philadelphia PA, Children's Health System, Pathology, Jacksonville FL, USA; 6Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Atlanta GA, USA; 7University of Florida, College of Medicine, Jacksonville FL, USA; 8Washington University, Surgical Pathology, St. Louis MO, USA Background/Objectives: Background: Pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB) is the most common primary malignant lung tumor of infancy and early childhood. Types I and Ir PPB are purely cystic whereas Types II and III PPB are mixed cystic/solid and entirely solid respectively. Types II and III PPB are multipatterned sarcomas often with rhabdomyosarcomatous and cartilaginous differentiation. PPB is linked to underlying germline and tumor specific mutations in DICER1. Design/Methods: Methods: Cases of primitive sarcoma resembling PPB but with primary site in the peritoneum were identified from pathology case files at Washington University Medical Center and Children's National Medical Center. DICER1 sequencing was performed using standard techniques. Results: A total of five cases of peritoneal PPB were identified. The patients presented at an median age of 13 years. Primary site of origin was fallopian tube in 3 cases. One arose from the serosal surface of the colon and one from the pelvic sidewall. One case appeared analogous to Type Ir PPB; the other 4 were analogous to Type II or III PPB. All had DICER1 mutations identified in germline and/or tumor DNA. Conclusions: Discussion: Peritoneal PPB represents a new manifestation of the DICER1 syndrome whose pathologic features may be identical to Types II or III PPB as a multipatterned sarcoma with cartilaginous and rhabdomyosarcomatous differentiation. This pattern is also seen in DICER1related renal sarcoma and cervical embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma with cartilaginous features and SertoliLeydig cell tumor with heterologous elements which may include rhabdomyosarcomatous and cartilaginous components. These newly recognized tumors are distinguished, however by their unusual origin in the peritoneal cavity. The differential diagnosis is malignant mixed m\u00fcllerian tumor (carcinosarcoma) which is typically seen in women 40 years of age and older. Tumors arising in the abdomen/pelvis with heterogeneous rhabdomyosarcomatous and/or cartilaginous differentiation should prompt consideration of germline and tumor DICER1 testing. PD-031 Prognostic Relevance of Early Radiologic Response to Induction Chemotherapy in Pediatric Rhabdomyosarcoma. A Report from the International Society of Pediatric Oncology MMT95 Study B.

However, existing literature on the predictive value of radiologic response on survival is contradictory. Therefore we retrospectively analysed the association of early response with survival from the data of the SIOPMMT95 study. Design/Methods: We studied432 IRS group III (macroscopic residual) patients enrolled in the SIOPMMT95 study with response assessment after 3 courses of chemotherapy (assessed 2dimensionally). Patients with progressive disease after 3 courses of chemotherapy were excluded (n=7). Failurefree survival (FFS) and overall survival (OS), were assessed between three groups (complete/partial, objective and no response) with Cox proportional hazards. Results: After 3 courses of chemotherapy, 85.2% of the patients had complete/partial response, 8.6% had objective response, and 6.3% had no response. For all patients 5year FFS [95% and 74% [70%78]. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis revealed no significant difference in FFS and OS rate between response groups. The adjusted hazard ratios for objective response and no response were 1.09 [0.63 to 1.88] and 0.81 [0.39 to 1.67] for FFS and 0.91 [0.471.76] and 1.27 [0.612.64] for OS, respectively. Conclusions: These results provide further evidence that early radiologic response to chemotherapy is not predictive for survival in patients with rhabdomyosarcoma. Treatment adaptations based on early response (except for patients with progressive disease) should therefore not be incorporated in future studies. PD-032 Is There A Role for Radiotherapy in Pediatric Patients with Locoregionally Recurrent Rhabdomyosarcoma? Toxicity and Clinical Outcomes in an Irradiated and NonIrradiated MultiInstitutional Cohort Children's Research Hospital, Radiation Oncology, Memphis, USA; 2University of Tennessee West Cancer Center, Radiation Oncology, Memphis, USA; 3Emory University Winshop Cancer Institute, Hospital, Research Hospital, Surgical Oncology, Memphis, USA Background/Objectives: A paucity of data exist detailing the role of local therapies (radiotherapy [RT], surgery) following locoregional recurrence (LR) in pediatric rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). We evaluated outcomes and prognostic factors using a multiinstitutional cohort of patients with LR managed with or without repeat RT (ReRT). Design/Methods: 23 patients with LR RMS were treated from 1996 to 2012 were eligible for inclusion. Patient stage, risk, group, histology, translocation status, primary location, histology, surgical extent, RT dose and failure pattern were documented. Overall (OS), local, and distant failure free survival (LFFS, DFFS) were described using the KaplanMeier estimator. Results: With a median followup of 4.6 years from LR, 7 (30%) patients were alive and 5 (22%) had no evidence of disease. Salvage therapy included ReRT and surgery in 50% and 50% of cases. All patients received chemotherapy at LR. Median OS and PFS from LR were 19.3 and 16.9 months. Patients with low risk and favorable primary site had improved PFS and OS. LFFS and DFFS at 3 years following salvage therapy were 54%, and 56% respectively. The median LFFS and OS in the No ReRT vs. ReRT patients was 12.4 vs. 19.6 (p=0.1) and 18.8 vs. 26.1 mo (p=0.46). Patients with favorable site and group 3 disease, LRonly failure, and embryonal histology had improved LFFS with ReRT. No patients experienced > grade 3 acute toxicity. Late toxicities included second malignancy, and chemotherapy induced end organ failure in 2 and 2 patients respectively. LR failure was a component of cancer related death in 60% vs. 40% in the No ReRT vs. ReRT group (p= 0.02). Conclusions: Salvage RT may reduce the risk of further LR in patients with favorable disease and relapse characteristics, although distant failure remains common. Acute toxicities were minimal while second malignancies and chemotherapy induced end organ failure were a cause of late mortality. Solid Non Brain Tumours Retinoblastoma PD-033 Impact of a MultiFaceted Retinoblastoma Program Model in a Tertiary Hospital in the Philippines A.P. Alcasabas 1, G. Mercado2, P. Fajardo1, Lam4, J. Lecciones5, E. Domingo2 1University the Philippines Philippine General Hospital, Paediatrics, Manila, Philippines; 2University of the Philippines Philippine General Hospital, Ophthalmology, Manila, Philippines; 3Southern Philippines Medical Center, Pediatrics, Davao, Philippines; 4St. Jude Research Hospital, Global Pediatric Medicine, Memphis, USA; 5Philippine Children's Medical Center, Pediatrics, Manila, Philippines Background/Objectives: Retinoblastoma survival in the Philippines remains poor due to low detection rates, late referrals and incomplete treatment. Development of a retinoblastoma program involving stagebased treatment protocols, online tumor board meetings, patient navigation, data management and communitybased educational campaigns increased referrals and decreased extraocular presentations in a public referral hospital in Mindanao. The same model was later implemented in three referral centers in Luzon. We review the program's impact on patient outcomes at Philippine General Hospital where baseline data (20082012) showed census of 22/year, 54% extraocular disease, 26% survival and 56% abandonment rates. Design/Methods: Prospective data collection of consecutive patients diagnosed January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2016. Study endpoint was March 1, 2017. Results: A total of 96 patients were diagnosed: unilateral 62; bilateral 32; and trilateral 2. Mean age was 24.6 months (2 - 108). M:F 1.5:1. Majority had extraocular disease: International Retinoblastoma Staging System 0: 1 (1%); I: 38 (40%); 19 (20%); and unknown 5 (5%). Symptomtodiagnosis lag time was 12 months (1 45). At study endpoint, 43% (41) were alive, 28% (n=27) had lost to followup. The 1 and 2year overall survival was 69.7% and 55.3%, respectively, with survival highest for Stage I (100% and 97%, respectively) and lower for Stages III (63% and 40%, respectively) and IV (28% and 26%, respectively). The 1 and 2year abandonmentsensitive overall survival was slightly lower (60.4% and 46%, respectively) and followed similar trends by stage as the overall survival. Conclusions: This multifaceted retinoblastoma outcome improvement model demonstrated increases in patient referrals, treatment adherence and survival, and provides data to support additional replication and extension efforts for a national protocol for retinoblastoma. PD-034 Treatment Results In ExtraOcular Retinoblastoma with Invasion of the Optic Nerve at Presentation B. Chawla 1, F. Hasan1, R. Agarwal1, R. Seth2, S. Pathy3, S.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcome in retinoblastoma patients who had invasion of the optic nerve at the time of diagnosis and were treated with a uniform protocol consisting of multimodal therapy. Design/Methods: Patients of nonmetastatic extraocular retinoblastoma with evidence of optic nerve invasion on contrastenhanced MRI scan of the orbits and brain were studied. Demographic and clinical details were recorded. The treatment protocol consisted of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, enucleation, orbital external beam radiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy. Systemic chemotherapy consisted of intravenous vincristine, etoposide and carboplatin for 12 cycles. Following neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the optic nerve status was reassessed on MRI scan. Outcome parameters were survival probability and cause of death. Results: Forty eight children were studied (66.7% unilateral, 60% boys). The median age at presentation was 30 months. The median follow up was 18.6 months. Of 48 children, 18 (38%) died. The Kaplan Meier survival probability was 79% and 59% at one year and four years respectively. The most common cause of death was CNS relapse (83%). Conclusions: Advanced cases of retinoblastoma with optic nerve invasion can be managed by a multimodal treatment protocol. Although short term results are encouraging, long term outcomes need further evaluation. PD-035 Natural Killer Cell Therapy Against Retinoblastoma D.H. Medicine, Department of Ophthalmology, Seoul, Republic of Korea; 2Seoul National University Hospital, Fight against AngiogenesisRelated Blindness FARB Laboratory Clinical Research Institute, Seoul, Republic of Korea; 3Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Immunotherapy Research Center, Daejeon, Republic of Korea; 4Seoul National University College of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics Cancer Research Institute, Seoul, Republic of Korea Background/Objectives: This study aims to investigate therapeutic potential of natural killer (NK) cell therapy against retinoblastoma, the most common intraocular malignant tumor in children. In patients with retinoblastoma, it is inevitable to perform enucleation, total removal of eyeball, if conventional treatment options fail. In this context, novel treatment options are desperately required to treat patients with retinoblastoma. Design/Methods: NK92 cells (commercially available cell line) and cord bloodderived NK cells were prepared for in vitro cytotoxicity assays and in vivo intracardiac injection. In vitro cytotoxicity was evaluated by coculture of NK cells and retinoblastoma cells from 3 different retinoblastoma cell lines (Y79, WERIRb1, and SNUOTRb1) using calcein AM assay. For the evaluation of in vivo efficacy, retinoblastoma cells (2 \u00d7 104 cells) from 3 different retinoblastoma cell lines were injected into the vitreous cavity of Balb/c nude mice (n =12 per group). At 7 or 10 days after intravitreal injection of tumor cells, NK cells (1 or 5 \u00d7 106 cells) were administered via intracardiac route or carboplatin (50 mg/Kg) was administered through intraperitoneal route with 2 more administration on a weekly basis. In vivo cytotoxicity was evaluated using the visual grading system and histologic examination. Results: Both NK cells demonstrated considerable in vitro cytotoxicity against retinoblastoma cells. In addition, tumors were formed in a less severe manner in mice treated with NK cells than in ones treated with carboplatin or phosphatebuffered saline (negative control). It is also remarkable that mice treated with combination of NK cells and carboplatin demonstrated minimal tumor formation in intraocular space compared to ones treated with only NK cells or carboplatin. Conclusions: Taken together, NK cells demonstrated in vitro and in vivo cytotoxicity against retinoblastoma. We expect that NK cell therapy might be involved in the treatment of retinoblastoma. Solid Non Brain Tumours Liver Tumours PD-036 CD146 Is a Potential Therapeutic Target in Hepatoblastoma M. Sonoda 1, K. Umeda2, S. Nodomi2, S. Uemoto1, T. Heike2 1Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Pediatric Surgery, Kyoto, Japan; 2Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Pediatrics, Kyoto, Japan; 3Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Human Health Science, Kyoto, Japan; 4Kyoto University, Center for iPS Cell Research and Application, Kyoto, Japan Background/Objectives: Hepatoblastoma (HB) is the most common malignant liver tumor in childhood. Recent progress in both surgical techniques and in neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy has markedly improved the prognosis for patients with HB: however, the survival rate of patients with metastatic and relapsed disease remains unsatisfactory. CD146 is an integral membrane glycoprotein that promotes tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis and is regarded as a promising candidate for immunotherapy against various CD146expressing malignancies. Design/Methods: The expression level of CD146 in two HB cell lines (HepG2 and Huh6) and clinical samples was examined by flow cytometric and immunohistochemical analyses. The antitumor effect of blocking CD146 rabbit antiCD146 polyclonal antibody or shRNA knockdown of CD146 was then evaluated both in vitro (by WST8 assay) and in vivo (by subcutaneous transplantation into immunodeficient mice). Results: CD146positive cells were detected in both HB cell lines and most of clinical samples. Knockdown of CD146 significantly inhibited in vitro tumor viability via induction of apoptosis, and markedly suppressed in vivo tumor formation in immunodeficient mice. AntiCD146 polyclonal antibody also showed effective in vivo antitumor activity. Details of underlying mechanism are now under investigation. Conclusions: Notable antitumor effect of blocking CD146 will facilitate a novel immunotherapy for HB. PD-037 Impact of the Response to Chemotherapy on the Clinical Outcome of Hepatoblastoma after Liver Transplantation: A Single Institute Experience K. Umeda 1, H. Okajima2, K. Kawaguchi3, S. Nodomi1, K. Watanabe3, S. Adachi2 1Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Pediatrics, Kyoto, Japan; 2Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Pediatric Surgery, Kyoto, 3Shizuoka Children's Hospital, Hematology and Oncology, Shizuoka, Japan Background/Objectives: Liver transplantation (LT), which was performed as a primary surgery (primary LT) or subsequently for recurrent tumor after a primary resection (rescue LT), has recently contributed to the elevation of cure rates for patients with unresectable hepatoblastoma (HB). The prognosis of patients with recurrent HB after LT was extremely dismal. However, there are many unresolved problems, including the risk factors for postLT relapse and treatment strategy for postLT relapse. Design/Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical outcome of 24 patients with HB who underwent LT between 1997 and 2015. Results: The 5yr OS rate of all patients was 69.6% \u00b1 9.7%. Both serum AFP level at LT and decline in the serum AFP level at LT in comparison with that at diagnosis were significantly higher in the remission group than those in the relapse group. The 5yr OS rate of patients with a decline of AFP >95% (81.3% \u00b1 9.8%) at LT was higher than that in patients with a decline of AFP 95% (42.9% \u00b1 18.7%). The 5yr OS rate of patients undergoing rescue LT (72.7% \u00b1 13.4%) was comparable to that of patients undergoing primary LT (69.2% \u00b1 12.8%). In the primary LT group, six of ten patients with a decline of AFP >95% were alive in remission, whereas both patients with a decline of AFP 95% experienced postLT relapse. In the rescue LT group, all three patients with any decline of AFP to preLT chemotherapy (range, 82.0-90.8%) were alive in remission, whereas three of six patients with no response to preLT chemotherapy experienced postLT relapse. Conclusions: Response to chemotherapy might be a reliable marker for predicting postLT relapse, even for patients undergoing rescue LT. Solid Non Brain Tumours Germ Cell Tumours PD-038 Pediatric Barretta4, G. Di Cristina, Pediatric Oncology, Palermo, Italy Background/Objectives: We describe the results of a therapeutic approach with a pediatric BEP (bleomycin, testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT). Design/Methods: From March 2004 to December 2016, males under 18 years were enrolled in the AIEOP study. Treatment, defined as specific chemotherapy regimen and number of cycles, was allocated by means of riskgroup assignment at diagnosis with consideration for stage. All patients underwent orchiectomy at diagnosis and those with stage I received no chemotherapy. Patients with stage II and III received three cycles for total doses of platinum 300 mg/m2 plus etoposide 1200 mg/m2 and bleomycin 45 mg/m2 (BEP). Patients with stage IV received four cycles for a total doses of platinum 400 mg/m2 plus etoposide 1,600 mg/m2 and blemoycin 60 mg/m2. After chemotherapy, retroperitoneal and/or lung residual diseases were removed by surgery. Results: One hundred and thirteen patients were evaluable with a median age of 16 year old (range 6 months 17.10 years) staged as follows: 58 stage I, 9 stage II, 19 stage III and 27 stage IV. Overall survival (OS) and eventfree survival (EFS) at 5 years for the whole series were 97.8% (CI 96.3% 99.3%) and 75.1% (CI (CI 84.9% 93.9%), respectively. The median follow up was 42 months. Conclusions: We confirmed the excellent prognosis of TGCT in children and adolescents. Reduction of cumulative dose of etoposide did not seem to compromise survival outcomes for patients in stages IIIV, but further investigations are needed to draw conclusions.

In particular, Pleuropulmonary Blastoma (PPB), a rare and potentially aggressive intrathoracic neoplasm, can be confused with other tumors or malformative lesions. The correct diagnosis is the first step to establish the right treatment. The aim of the present study was to assess the ability of diagnosing patients with PPB for each European country, comparing the number of the expected PPB cases with the number of registered cases. Design/Methods: The expected number of PPB was calculated from 2000 to 2014 on the basis of pediatric epidemiological data (www.Eurostat.it) and the reported incidence of PPB. The number of observed patients with PPB has been obtained sending a questionnaire to the physicians identified as the national contact for VRT in 26 European countries. Results: Twenty countries provided data: overall 121 PPB cases have been observed, comparing to 109 expected cases. A low number of patients with PPB has been registered mainly in eastern countries, in particular: Bulgaria, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Lithuania did not observe any case. More patients than expected were diagnosed in Finland, Sweden, Israel and especially in France, Poland and Italy where national registries and cooperative groups dedicated to VRT exist. In addition the experience from these countries suggests that the incidence of PPB may be higher than previously reported. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that differences in the number of observed/expected cases of PPB exist across European countries and suggest that this may be related to the presence of national VRT cooperative groups.

Design/Methods: This was a retrospective, observational study of primary pancreatoblastoma in patients< 18 years of age who were treated at Beijing children's hospital (BCH) between 2005 and 2015. Results: 21 patients with pancreatoblastoma were diagnosed at a median age of 4 years, 7 girls and 14 boys. The diagnosis of pancreatoblastoma was identified by the histology examination. The most common syndrome was abdominal mass(n=11), followed by abdominal pain(N=10), elevated serum AFP levels were noted in all cases, of 17 patients with disease initially unresectable at presentation, accepted neoadjuvant chemotherapy consisting of CDV, OPEC, PLADO, IEV, and AVCP. All patients underwent surgery, splenectomy, RouxenY end to end pancreatojejunostomy. In all, 13 children are disease free with a median followup of 53 months (range, 11156 months). Conclusions: The pancreatoblastoma in children and adolescents is a curable malignant tumor. Complete resection combined with chemotherapy is associated with longterm survival. For the unresectable tumor at diagnosis, preoperative chemotherapy (OPEC) were recommended to reduce tumor volume. Brain Tumours PD-041 Humanized AntiCD47 Antibody Combined with an Agonist ANTICD40 is an Effective Treatment for DIPG Xenografts with CranioSpinal Dissemination S. Gholamin 1, I. Weissman3, S. Mitra2, S. Cheshier4 1California Institute of Technology Caltech, Biology and Biological Engineering, Pasadena, USA; 2Stanford, Neurosurgery, Stanford, USA; 3Stanford, Institute of USA; 4Stanford, Neurosurgery, Stanoford, USA Background/Objectives: DIPG is the most common malignant brainstem tumor in children. The resistance of DIPG to standard treatments along with inoperability of this tumor because of the anatomical location leave DIPG patients with dismal prognosis. Multiple studies revealed that DIPG patients have only a few months of survival after detection of craniospinal metastasis. Our previous work showed that a humanized antiCD47 antibody (antihuCD47 mAb), an immunemodulatory drug that increases phagocytic activity of macrophages against cancer cells, has a therapeutic effect on DIPG xenografts. However, the efficacy of antiCD47 therapy was inversely correlated with tumor size and presence of metastasis at the onset of treatment. Therefore, we tested the synergistic effect of antihuCD47 mAb combined with antimsCD40 mAb, another immunomodulatory antibody that increases the recruitment of macrophages to the tumor site, on DIPG xenografts with craniospinal dissemination. Design/Methods: Humanderived DIPG cells were infected with GFPluciferase expressing virus and injected to the pons of NOD scid gamma mice. The engraftment was verified via bioluminescent (BLI) imaging. The mice with positive signal in forebrain and spine were randomized for treatment with antihuCD47 mAb antimsCD40 Ab alone, antihuCD47 mAb coupled with antimsCD40 mAb, and control. The efficacy of treatment was measured using followup BLI imaging and survival analysis. Results: Followup BLI imaging revealed significant decline in the flux measures of mice receiving combined treatment (P< 0.05). BLI signals from the spinal and forebrain strongly diminished in the mice under combined treatment compared to the other groups. A significant extension in survival was seen in this group compared to the other three groups (P < 0.05). Conclusions: combinatorial treatment with antiCD47 Ab and antiCD40 Ab is effective in the removal of not only DIPG from a primary site but also a craniospinal dissemination of the disease. PD-042 Patient Derived Cell Lines to Study Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT) in Pediatric Brain Division of Oncology, Philadelphia, USA; 2University of Pennsylvania, Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, USA; 3The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Center for Data Driven Discovery in Biomedicine, Philadelphia, USA Background/Objectives: All cancers acquire a mechanism of telomere maintenance (TMM) for unlimited replicative potential. Some cancers, including a subset of pediatric brain tumors, use the TMM of alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). However, there are few cancer cell lines with ALT, representing a mixture of histotypes. We aim to generate and characterize patient derived pediatric brain tumor cell lines with and without ALT. Design/Methods: The Children's Brain Tumor Tissue Consortium (CBTTC) database was queried for pediatric and adolescent brain tumor types likely to have ALT, and tumor in freezing media. Patient derived cell lines were generated as adherent and suspension lines. Corresponding primary tumor samples were analyzed for ALT by ccircle assay (CCA) and genomic analysis for a targeted set of genes. Results: The CBTTC biorepository had 37 primary highgrade glioma and PNET samples available for processing into patient derived cell lines, including 2 diagnosisrelapse pairs. To date, 22/37 are growing well in various stages of development and validation. Analysis of the cell line's corresponding primary tumors revealed that 9/35 (25%) are ALT positive. H3F3A (17%) of H3F3A wildtype tumors are ALT positive. As expected, ALT positive tumors are more likely to occur in older patients (16 vs 10 years old, p= 0.018) and to be hemispheric (6/9, 67%). WGS was available for 19 tumors, including 4 with ALT. The ALT positive tumors have damaging mutations in TP53 (4/4), ATRX (2/4), H3F3A (2/4) and IDH1 (1/4). Conclusions: The CBTTC makes it possible to generate patient derived cell lines from a wellcharacterized set of pediatric primary brain tumors for collaborative science. The panel is representative of reported characteristics of ALT positive pediatric brain tumors with respect to associated mutations, frequency and location. PD-043 Cutaneous Toxicities of BRAF and MEK Inhibitors in P. C. D. Hargrave1 1Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, United Kingdom; 2Great Ormond Street Hospital, Dermatology, London, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: BRAF and MEK inhibitors are emerging therapies in childhood malignancy. The cutaneous side effects are well described in adult patients, but not in children. We undertook to document the spectrum of cutaneous side effects seen in children treated with these agents at our tertiary hospital, as well as the onset, duration and severity of the skin findings. Design/Methods: Retrospective chart review of children treated with either a BRAF (dabrafenib) or MEK inhibitor (trametinib). Basic demographic and clinical characteristics were collected from patient records and the skin findings assessed in collaborations with a paediatric dermatologist. Results: Twentyfour children aged 116 years (mean 8.4 years) treated with either a BRAF (11) or MEK inhibitor (13) for BRAFV600mutant refractory or intracranial type optic glioma and (7), Langerhan cell histiocytosis (LCH) (3), or leptomeningeal melanocytosis/melanoma (3) were identified. One patient received combination BRAF/MEK inhibitor therapy. Mean treatment duration was 39 weeks (792) for BRAF and 19 weeks (737) for MEK inhibitor therapy. Six (54%) children treated with dabrafenib developed new melanocytic naevi (736 weeks), 5 of these also developed a persistent erythema nodsumlike (EN) eruption (onset 132 weeks) 2 diffuse alopecia, (onset 29 and 40 weeks) and single cases keratosis pilaris, an acneiform facial rash. Six (46%) children on a MEK inhibitor developed paronychia (onset 420 weeks), 5 of these also developing hair thinning (onset 417 weeks) and generalised xerosis (onset 28 weeks). Four patients (30%) developed acneiform eruptions. 1 child required dose reduction of therapy due to cutaneous side effects. Two patients discontinued treatment and one patient died because of disease progression. Conclusions: Cutaneous adverse effects of BRAF an MEK inhibitor therapy are common and well tolerated in paediatric patients. Our experience is that prophylactic management is beneficial. PD-044 Quality of Life, Growth, and Hypothalamic Lesions in ChildhoodOnset Craniopharyngioma H.L. M\u00fcller 1, Eveslage3, G. Calaminus4 1Klinikum Oldenburg A\u00f6R Medical Campus University Oldenburg, Department of Pediatrics and Pediatric Hematology / Oncology, Oldenburg, M\u00fcnster, Germany; 4University of Bonn, Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Bonn, Germany Background/Objectives: Quality of life (QoL) after childhoodonset craniopharyngioma (CP) is frequently impaired by tumour and/or treatmentrelated factors such as endocrine deficits and hypothalamic involvement (HI). Design/Methods: We prospectively analyzed parental and selfassessment of CP patient QoL at 3 mo, 1 and 3 yrs after CP diagnosis related to growth hormone (GH) substitution and HI. Fortyseven of 194 CP patients recruited 20072015 fulfilled the inclusion criteria: 1.) histological CP diagnosis, 2.) age at diagnosis 618 yrs; 3.) availability of QoL data one and three yrs after diagnosis. QoL was assessed using the Pediatric Quality of Life (PEDQOL) questionnaire. Results: Parents estimated QoL of their children worse than patients did themselves for the PEDQOL domains emotional stability, body image, physical function, and social function / friends and family. HI was associated with lower selfassessed QoL 3 mo after diagnosis (body image, p<0.01; social function/friends, p<0.01). The negative impact of HI on QoL was greater for parental assessed QoL at all time points. GH substitution had no relevant effect on shortterm weight and height development. CP patients, GHtreated at 3 yrs followup, presented at baseline (1 yr after diagnosis, before GH substitution) with reduced selfassessed QoL for the PEDQOL domains autonomy function (p<0.05), compared with GH nontreated CP patients. QoL stabilized during 13 yrs of followup in GH treated patients, whereas non GHtreated patients experienced decreases in QoL for the PEDQOL domains physical function and social function/friends. Conclusions: Parents assess QoL in CP survivors worse than their children. As HI is a major risk factor for reduced QoL, treatment strategies in CP should aim at prevention of (further) hypothalamic damage. GH substitution should be considered as an effective option to ameliorate imminent impairments of QoL after CP. PD-045 Relapsed Medulloblastomas Treated a Therapy: A Report of the HIT'2000, HITREZ97 and HITREZ2005 S. Tippelt 1, of Bonn, of Bonn, Heidelberg, Pediatric Hematology Biostatistics Germany; 9University of Bonn, Pediatric and Oncology, Bonn, Germany Background/Objectives: Despite a multimodal relapse therapy the prognosis of patients with a recurrent medulloblastoma (MB) is poor. The aim of this analysis was to evaluate prognostic factors for progressionfree survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients with a 1st recurrence of MB enrolled in the German HIT'2000, HITREZ97 and HITREZ2005 studies. Design/Methods: Patients with a recurrent MB between July 1997 and August 2011 were included in this analysis. Data analyzed at relapse were age, gender, histological subgroup, metastases stage, relapse therapy, disease state at last follow up. KaplanMeier analysis was used to estimate the PFS/OS after 1st recurrence. Possible prognostic factors for PFS/OS were investigated by performing univariate and multivariate analyses. Results: This analysis included 229 patients [71 female/158 male, median age at 1st recurrence 11.1 years (0.8-36.1), median PFS after primary diagnosis 2.0\u00b10.1 years] suffering from a local or metastatic relapse (13.9%/86.1%). At first recurrence 90.4% of 45.4%, highdose underwent tumor resection, 31.4% of patients received radiotherapy. Median PFS after 1st recurrence was 1.0\u00b10.1 years (0.125.4), the median OS 1.8\u00b10.2 years (0.126.2). The 2, 5 and 10yearPFS and were 25.9%, 7.8%, 4.4% and nonapplication of radiotherapy (HR 2.0;1.9), and the application of only an oral chemotherapy (HR 1.7;1.8) turned out to be poor prognostic parameters. Conclusions: Multimodal therapy led to longterm OS in a few patients with recurrent MB. Local recurrent disease, reresection, reirradiation and systemic intravenous chemotherapy were associated with a prolonged PFS/OS. Future studies will identify the prognostic relevance of molecular subgroups and of new targeted or antiangiogenic therapies, therefore rebiopsy is highly recommended. Supported by German Children's Cancer Foundation PD-046 Pseudoprogression After Irradiation in Pediatric Low Grade Glioma D.S. E.S. Murphy2, T.E. Hospital, Department of Radiation Oncology, Memphis, USA; 2Cleveland Clinic, Department of Radiation Oncology, Cleveland, USA; 3Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Department of Epidemiology, Boston, USA; 4School of Medicine University of Athens NKUA, Department of Hygeine Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, Athens, Greece Background/Objectives: The goal of this study was to characterize the incidence of pseudoprogression after radiation therapy (RT) for pediatric lowgrade glioma (LGG). Design/Methods: Patients age 21 with intracranial pediatric LGG (WHO grade III) treated with curativeintent RT at a single institution were included in this retrospective review. Pseudoprogression was defined for this investigation as an increase in tumour size 10% in 2 dimensions between two MR imaging studies, or serial growth <10% in two dimensions over three studies, while accounting for competing risks of true progression or death. Eventfree survival (EFS) was defined as survival without true progression or secondary highgrade glioma. Results: Sixtytwo of 221 patients (28%) 9year cumulative incidence of 29.0% (95% CI 23.035.2). Median time to pseudoprogression was 6.1 months after RT (interquartile range [IQR] 3.514.6, 0.9105). and in 11 (18%), 7 (11%), and 2 patients (3%), respectively. The median time to pseudoprogressionrelated procedure was 3.4 months after RT (IQR 1.86.1). The remaining asymptomatic patients (68%) were observed; 30 (48%) had shrinkage and 11 (18%) stabilized. Median duration of pseudoprogression was 6.2 months (IQR 3.211.7) among asymptomatic patients. Patients with pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) had increased odds of developing pseudoprogression relative to other histology (odds ratio 5.7, 95% CI 2.712.0, p < 0.0001). Among patients with PA (n = 127), the 9year cumulative incidence of pseudoprogression was 42.9% (95% CI 33.851.7) and in this group, pseudoprogression was associated with improved 10year EFS (84.5% vs. 58.5%, logrank p = 0.008) logrank p = 0.030). Conclusions: Pseudoprogression after irradiation is common, especially in patients with pilocytic astrocytoma, and appears to be prognostic for survival. Knowledge of the incidence and temporal course of pseudoprogression may help avoid unnecessary salvage treatment. Treatment and Care New Drugs/Experimental Therapeutics PD-047 Development of a Small Molecule Inhibitor for SAMHD1 to Improve Outcome for Patients with Acute Myelogenous Leukaemia and Relapsed TLymphoblastic Malignancies Treated with MBB, Stockholm, Sweden; 3Heidelberg Diseases, Heidelberg, OnkPat, Stockholm, accounts for approximately 5% of all childhood cancers, and despite highly toxic multidrug regimens more than 30% of patients cannot be cured. The deoxycytosine analogue cytarabine (araC) together with anthracyclines constitutes the backbone of AMLdirected therapy. Treatment failure is frequently caused by resistance to araC, more specifically, by the lack of intracellular accumulation of the triphosphorylated active metabolite araCTP in leukemic blasts. Nelarabine, a prodrug of araG, has sparked hope to improve the dismal survival for children with relapsed Tlymphoblastic leukaemia or lymphoma, but remission rates are only about 30% Just like araC effects are mediated by araCTP, nelarabine toxicity relies on its intracellular conversion to araGTP. We have previously shown that SAMHD1 hydrolyses araCTP and araGTP and confers resistance to araC both in leukaemia mouse models. Retrospective analyses of 300 AML patients suggested a therapylimiting effect of SAMHD1. Design/Methods: Using a cellbased phenotypic cell proliferation inhibition assay, we screened approximately 35,000 small molecule compounds to identify lead substances that synergise with araC in wildtype SAMHD1, but not CRISPR/Cas9 SAMHD1knockout cells. SAMHD1 inhibition was confirmed using an in vitro activity assay with recombinant SAMHD1. Target engagement was assessed by cellularthermal shift assays (CETSA) and Xray crystallography. Results: We that sensitised wildtype cells more araC nelarabine, i.e. completely abolished SAMHD1mediated resistance while leaving SAMHD1knockout cells unaffected. These results could be recapitulated in vivo using paediatric AML mouse models. Conclusions: We suggest that SAMHD1 might play a dual role for future leukaemia therapies: 1) a biomarker to guide dose adjustments with the aim to reduce toxicity for low expressers. 2) a target for drug candidates amenable for clinical trials based on our preclinical SAMHD1 inhibitors to improve efficacy of araC and nelarabine treatments for high expressers of SAMHD1. PD-048 Reporting of Clinical Significance in Pediatric Oncology Randomized Control Trials: A Systematic Review F. Howard 1, K. Goddard2, O. Samargandi3, H. Hasan2 1University of British Columbia, School of Nursing, Vancouver, Canada; 2British Columbia Cancer Agency, Radiation Oncology, Vancouver, Canada; 3QEII Health Sciences Centre, Division of Plastic Surgery, Halifax, Canada Background/Objectives: Traditionally, the interpretation of randomized control trials (RCTs) have relied on statistical significance as opposed to clinical significance, including the use of minimally clinically important difference (MCID), which raises questions about study design rigor and utility of results. The degree to which clinical significance has been applied and reported in RCTs in pediatric cancer has not been determined. The objective of this review was to systematically assess the reporting of clinical significance based on the delta value reported in the sample size calculation and to identify factors associated with clinical significance in RCTs in the pediatric oncology literature. Design/Methods: This systematic review involved a comprehensive search of MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Childhood Cancer Group Specialized Register through CENTRAL from inception to July 2016. Eligible studies included RCTs of primary cancer treatments in pediatric patients diagnosed with cancer. Results: RCTs (101), representing 126 randomized questions were included. The minority (19.8%) of randomized questions reported conclusions based on clinical significance. Only 6.3% of randomized questions explicitly identified that the delta value in the sample size calculation was based on the MCID. The statistical significance of the primary outcome was based on a pvalue in 77.8% of randomized questions, while over half (63.5%) reported confidence intervals or standard error bars for the point estimate in question. The median publishing journal impact factor and planned sample size were larger for randomized questions that reported clinical significance as opposed to those that did not. Conclusions: A minority RCTs in the published pediatric oncology literature have reported methodological attributes related to clinical significance and have drawn study conclusions based on clinical significance. The integration of clinical significance into study design and subsequent reporting in future pediatric oncology trials will enhance evidencebased decision making in clinical practice and policy. PD-049 Comparing Arsenic Trioxide and Indigo Naturalis Formula in Pediatric Patients with Acute Promyeloid Leukemia: An Interim Report of Muticenter and Sun Yatsen University, Pediatrics, Guangzhou, China; 2XiangYa Hospital Central South University, pediatrics, Changsha, China; 3The Second XiangYa Hospital Central South University, pediatrics, Changsha, China; 4Guangdong General Hospital, pediatrics, Guangzhou, China; 5The Second Affiliated Hospital of Sun YatSen University, pediatrics, Guangzhou, China; 6Zhujiang Hospital of Southern Medical University, pediatrics, guangzhou, China; 7Shenzhen Children's Hospital, pediatrics, Shenzhen, China; 8The Third Affiliated Hospital of Zhongshan University, pediatrics, Guangzhou, China; 9The first people's Hospital of Huizhou, pediatrics, Huizhou, China; 10Nanfang Hospital of Southern Medical University, pediatrics, Guangzhou, China; 11Huizhou Central Hospital, pediatrics, Huizhou, China Background/Objectives: Indigo naturalis formula (RIF) is a traditional Chinese medicine with tetraarsenic tetrasulfide, indirubin and tanshinone IIA as major active ingredients. RIF can be taken orally, which reduces hospital days. Eventfree survival (EFS) is about 90% in adult patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) treated on protocol containing RIF, alltrans retinoic acid (ATRA) and chemotherapeutic agents (RIF+ATRA+chemotherapy), which is comparable to that of patients on arsenic trioxide (ATO)+ATRA+chemotherapy. However, the efficacy and safety of RIF in pediatric counterpart have not been evaluated, and it is unclear whether RIF can replace ATO. Design/Methods: SCCG (South China Children Leukemia Group)APL protocol was started in august 2011. Patients of age 016 were enrolled except those having intracranial hemorrhage / central nervous system leukemia with coma, convulsion or nervous paralysis at diagnosis. Patients were randomized into ATO or RIF group and received \"ATO/RIF+ATRA+lowdose anthracycline\" for induction and consolidation therapy followed by \"ATO/RIF+ATRA+MTX+6MP\" for 96 weeks of maintenance therapy. Those with highrisk APL (WBC 109/L at diagnosis) received additional AraC in consolidation phase. Results: Among 84 patients diagnosed, 78 met the enrollment criteria and were willing to be randomized. Headache and vomit/nausea were the commonest treatmentrelated adverse effects occurring in 18% and 12% of patients in each group during induction and consolidation therapy respectively. Significant treatmentrelated infections including sepsis, pneumonia, cellulitis and etc. were observed in 13% and 8% of patients during induction, and 12% and 8% of patients during consolidation, in ATO and RIF groups, respectively (P>0.05). There were two dropout cases in ATO group, one abounded treatment and the other deviated from the protocol because of adverse effect. The 4year EFSs (median followup of 2 years) of both groups were 100%. Conclusions: SCCGAPL protocol containing arsenic (either ATO or RIF), ATRA and lowintensive chemotherapy obtained a good outcome in childhood APL (including highrisk). PD-050 Development of GD2 and M. Pule2, K. Straathof 1 1UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, Developmental Biology and Cancer Program Cancer Section, London, United Kingdom; 2UCL Cancer Institute, Haematology, London, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: New treatment strategies for highrisk neuroblastoma are needed to improve outcome and reduce treatmentrelated late effects. Using bispecific Tcell engagers (BiTEs) to redirect the patient's own Tcells to recognize and eliminate neuroblastoma tumour cells proves an attractive novel treatment option. Indeed, CD19/CD3 BiTE Blinatumumab has shown great promise in treatment of highrisk leukemia. Here, we describe the selection of the optimal GD2/CD3 BiTE format for use in treatment of neuroblastoma. Design/Methods: Fourteen BiTE variants were constructed using single chain variable fragments (scFv) derived from three different humanized CD3specific antibodies and two different humanized GD2specific antibodies fused with three different size linkers. First, BiTEs were characterised by measuring thermal stability profiles using differential scanning fluorimetry, and antigen specificity and binding affinity to antigenpositive and negative tumour cell lines using flow cytometry and Scatchard analysis. Then, functional comparisons were performed by determining antigenspecific tumour cell lysis at a range of BiTE concentrations. Results: All BiTE formats tested demonstrated specificity for GD2 and CD3. BiTEs based on the GD2specific scFv with the highest binding affinity had the lowest IC50 values i.e. concentration that achieved half maximal cytolytic activity of GD2positive cells. In contrast, differences in CD3 binding affinities for scFv tested did not translate into significant differences in ability to redirect Tcells to GD2positive cell lysis. BiTEs with medium and long linkers mediated Tcell lysis of GD2positive cells at lower concentrations than BiTEs with shorter linkers. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that binding affinity of tumourspecific scFv as well as linker length determine the potency of GD2/CD3 BiTEs. For selected BiTE formats detailed studies of antitumour response including Tcell proliferation and cytokine secretion profile are currently ongoing. This data set will inform the selection of the optimal GD2/CD3 BiTE format which will be taken forward for development into a novel clinical therapeutic for neuroblastoma. PD-051 Complete Remissions Post Infusion of Multiple Tumor Antigen Specific T Cells for the Treatment of High Risk Leukemia and Lymphoma Patients After HCT K. Williams 1, M. Grant1, M. Ismail1, F. Hoq1, M. Martin Manso1, of hematologic malignancies after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) confers high mortality because of progressive disease and graftvs.host disease (GVHD). Hence, we hypothesized that tumorassociated antigenspecific lymphocytes (TAAL) would be specific, diminish immune escape, and could safely decrease cancer burden. Design/Methods: We expanded lymphocytes reactive infusions at Twentyfive donorderived TAAL products were generated and lacked alloreactivity in vitro. TAAL products contained T cells were predominantly effector memory, with >30% expressing the activation markers, and <15% of Tcells expressing exhaustion markers (PD1, TIM3, LAG3). Specificity of TAAL showed greatest response to PRAME by ELIspot. Ten HCT recipients (aged 970 years) with relapsed Hodgkins disease (n=2), BALL (n=3), or AML (n=5) received 13 doses of TAAL. All patients had relapsed 212 months after HCT (9 allo, 1 auto). Post infusion, there were no adverse events attributed to TAAL and no GVHD. One patient withdrew prior to study completion due to progressive disease in the setting of steroids for sepsis. Responses of evaluable patients (n=9) were: PD (n=2), PR 3 had AML (1 received adjunct vidaza after TAAL); 1 patient had Ph+ALL and achieved bcrabl negativity post TAAL for the first time postHSCT without additional therapy. Immunosequencing of Tcell receptors detected multiple TCRs derived from the infused TAAL product 45 weeks after infusion. Conclusions: This unique immunotherapeutic has been well tolerated without causing GVHD or lifethreatening cytokine release syndrome. Despite aggressive and multiply relapsed disease, 7/9 evaluable patients have demonstrated evidence of disease control after TAAL, with 44% complete response, suggesting that TAAL may have efficacy in relapsed highrisk hematological malignancies after PD-052 Mechanisms of Efficacy of the PANFGFR Inhibitor AZD4547 in Pediatric Solid Tumor Models P. Zage 1, S. Hakim1, D. Subramonian1, J. Lesperance1 1University of California San Diego Moores Cancer Center, Pediatrics, San Diego, USA Background/Objectives: Children with aggressive pediatric solid tumors such as neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosaroma, and Ewing sarcoma have poor outcomes, and new therapies are needed. Aberrant expression and activity of growth factor receptors, including the Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor (FGFR) family, are associated with many malignancies. Therefore, we hypothesized that inhibition of FGFR family members using the novel panFGFR inhibitor AZD4547 would be effective against pediatric solid tumors. Design/Methods: We evaluated the effects of AZD4547 on the viability of neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and Ewing sarcoma cells using continuous live cell imaging to measure cell confluence and caspase activity. We also evaluated the effects of AZD4547 on cell migration and invasion using scratch wound and matrigel chamber invasion assays and the effects of AZD4547 on intracellular signaling with western blotting and QTPCR. Results: AZD4547 treatment of pediatric solid tumor cells resulted in decreased cell confluence, with calculated IC50 values varying from 3.7mM to more than 20mM, and in the induction of apoptosis. AZD4547 treatment at sublethal concentrations inhibited migration and invasion in vitro in all tested cell lines compared to untreated cells. AZD4547 treatment also resulted in decreased phosphorylation of Akt and S6 in all tested cell lines. Sensitive cell lines demonstrated increased levels of phosphoERK and complete inhibition of ERK phosphorylation after treatment, while resistant cell lines demonstrated minimal inhibition of ERK phosphorylation. Sensitive cell lines further demonstrated increased levels of phosphoSTAT3 while resistant cell lines demonstrated decreased or unchanged levels of phosphoSTAT3, suggesting potential markers for AZD4547 response and mechanisms of resistance. Conclusions: AZD4547 is effective against pediatric solid tumors including neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and Ewing sarcoma, and sensitivity to AZD4547 appears to be mediated by effects on the Ras/MAPK and JAK/STAT pathways. AZD4547 therefore represents a potential novel therapeutic agent for pediatric solid tumors, and further preclinical and clinical studies are warranted. Treatment and Care Supportive Care PD-053 Reducing Infection Related Morbidity and Mortality by Improving Time to Antibiotic Administration: A Quality Improvement Project in a Resource Limited Pediatric Oncology Unit M.C. dolendo 2St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Global Pediatric Oncology Department, Memphis, USA; 3Southern Philippines Medical Center, Family Medicine, Davao City, Philippines Background/Objectives: Childhood cancer is an important health concern in the Philippines with an estimated 6,800 new cases annually. Although survival rates have improved, infection related morbidity and mortality continue to be a threat. Timely recognition of infection and immediate administration of antibiotics have been shown to improve survival. This project aims to improve time to antibiotic administration for children with cancer and concomitant infection at our institution through feedback to the different stakeholders about their performance. Design/Methods: A quality improvement cycle was implemented at the Southern Philippines Medical Center Pediatric Oncology Unit in Mindanao. Charts of admitted patients meeting the inclusion criteria were reviewed in terms of demographics, clinical profile, timeliness of antibiotic administration and outcomes for a 3month period as baseline data on performance. A group feedback was then given after which repeat data collection was done for three months. Results: A total of 103 charts were reviewed at the beginning of the quality improvement cycle and 79 charts were reviewed after group feedback was given. Antibiotic initiation was delayed at baseline in 80.27% of cases while this decreased to 44.08% on repeat measurement (p value < 0.001). There were 24.72% of patients who died at baseline data collection while 11.39% died on repeat measurement (p value 0.023). Length of hospital stay at baseline and repeat measurement was similar at around 1718 days. Conclusions: Group feedback significantly reduced delays in antibiotic administration. There were also lesser number of unimproved or expired patients probably due to reduction in delays. Continuous quality improvement initiatives and need for multifaceted interventions are necessary to improve and sustain improvements in improving time to antibiotic administration for children with cancer in order to improve outcomes and reduce morbidity and mortality. PD-054 Olanzapine is an Inexpensive and Efficacious Agent for Breakthrough Chemotherapy Induced Acute Phase Vomiting Among Children Receiving Moderate or High Emetogenic Chemotherapy G. Kapoor 1, S. Koneru1, S. Jain1 1Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Research Centre, Pediatric Hematology & Oncology, Delhi, India Background/Objectives: Chemotherapy induced vomiting remains one of the most distressing adverse effects of cancer therapy and negatively impacts compliance and nutrition. Antiemetic data related to Olanzepine, an approved antipsychotic drug is mainly restricted to adult and few retrospective pediatric studies. Its low cost, easy availability and oral preparation make it ideal for use in resourcerestricted settings. The objectives of this study were to study the efficacy of olanzapine for breakthrough vomiting and assess its safety among children 218 years of age receiving moderate or high emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC, HEC, respectively per POGO guidelines). Design/Methods: This observational study was done over 6 months from JulyDecember 2016, after obtaining ethical approval. Acute breakthrough emesis was defined as vomiting occurring within 24hours of last dose of chemotherapy, despite adequate prophylaxis that included 5HT3 receptor antagonist, dexamethasone and aprepitant HEC). The dose of olanzapine was 0.050.1 mg/kg per oral once a day for 3 consecutive days. Patients on prior antiemetics or antipsychotics or with medical or surgical disorders likely to contribute to vomiting were excluded. Complete and partial responses were defined as no or 12 emetic episode/s respectively and use of no other rescue medications. Adverse events were graded as per CTCAE version 4.03. Results: This study analyses 42 chemotherapy blocks among 31 children (median age 9 years, male 21/31) with various hematological and solid malignancies receiving MEC(18/42) or HEC(24/42). Complete and partial responses were observed among 83%(35) and 14%(6) blocks respectively, much better than reports with metoclopramide. No statistical difference in efficacy was observed by age, gender or emetogenic regimen (p 0.2). Sideeffects included somnolence (grade transaminitis(grade 1, 1/42). Conclusions: efficacy and safety of an inexpensive agent like olanzapine make it a suitable option for breakthrough emesis for children in developing countries warranting large controlled prospective studies.

Kulkarni 1 Health Pediatric Hematology Oncology Department of Pediatrics, Halifax, Canada Background/Objectives: Dysfunction (defined as inability to flush and/or draw blood) is a common complication associated with central venous catheters (CVC). Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is often instilled to reverse episodes of CVC dysfunction. However, data on riskfactors associated with requirement of tPA are unclear. We hypothesized that clinicdemographic and CVC related variables are associated with requirement of use of tPA for episodes of CVC dysfunction in pediatric oncology patients. Design/Methods: In this population based study, case records of all pediatric oncology patients from Maritimes, Canada managed by the Izaac Walton Killam Health Centre from January 2,000 to December 2,015 were reviewed after ethics approval. Clinicodemographic data and characteristics of first CVC were pooled from: (i) Pediatric Oncology hospital database, (ii) Electronic medical records, (iii) Pharmacy database and (iv) Central line database. Patients with 1 episodes of CVC dysfunction of their first CVC requiring 1 dose of tPA were identified. Analysis was done using SPSS version 24. Results: At least 1 CVCs was required in 741 patients. One or more doses of tPA (mean: 2.04\u00b12.0) were required by 20.1% (n=149) of the patients for episodes dysfunction related to first CVC. On univariate analysis, age>10 years (p=0.015), diagnosis (classified as leukemia, lymphoma, sarcoma, brain tumor and others) (p=0.001), and use of tunneled lines (p=0.006) were significantly associated with use of tPA while gender (p=0.098) was not. On multivariate analysis, age>10 years [p=0.016, OR: 2.4 (95% CI:1.44.1)] were independently associated with a requirement for tPA. Conclusions: The present study identified independent risk factors ascertained at diagnosis associated for use of tPA for episodes of dysfunction associated with first CVC. After validation, a predictive risk model ascertained at diagnosis could be developed to identify high risk patients. PD-056 Effects of Combined Resistance and Endurance Training in Pediatric Cancer Patients during Intensive Treatment Phase: Design and First Insights into the MUCKIStudy S. St\u00f6ssel 1, M.A. Neu1, A. N. Henniger1, W. Bloch3, J. Faber1 1University Medical Center, Center for Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology/Hemostaseology, Mainz, Germany; 2University Hospital of Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine Center of Integrated Oncology K\u00f6ln Bonn, K\u00f6ln, Germany; 3German Sport University Cologne, Institute of Cardiovascular Research and Sports Medicine Department of Molecular and Cellular Sport Medicine, K\u00f6ln, Germany; 4University Medical Center, Center for Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine Department of Pediatric Cardiology, Mainz, Germany Background/Objectives: Due to various disease and treatmentrelated factors, skeletal muscle function in pediatric and adult cancer patients is impaired resulting in decreased muscular strength. Previous studies in adult cancer patients have shown that specific exercise interventions can increase muscular strength which was related to positive effects on wholebody muscle mass, fatigue and quality of life. The purpose of the MUCKI study is to determine whether combined resistance and endurance training can improve muscle strength in pediatric cancer patients during intensive cancer treatment phase (ICT). Design/Methods: Based on a pilot experimental phase, a feasible exercise program was developed. A convenient study design was established aiming to enroll 40 childhood cancer patients aged between 4 and 18 years. As part of the randomized, controlled and interventional study design, individuals within the exercise group (EG) participate in supervised exercise training. Training takes place 3 to 5 times per week over a period of 6 to 8 weeks during ICT. Individuals of the control group (CG) obtain usual care. Before and after the intervention muscle strength of upper and lower limbs, aerobic performance, body composition, fatigue and quality of life are determined. Results: Recruitment started in November 2015. So far 18 patients have been included. 9 patients were randomized to the EG from whom 7 have already completed the exercise intervention. Comparing pre and postintervention the knee flexor strength increased in the EG in average by 24.3% whereas it decreased by 7.6% in the CG (p<0.05). Further preliminary results regarding benefits from the exercise intervention on the above mentioned parameters show positive trends. In a post interventional interview patients reported that they enjoyed the exercise program and would recommend it to others. Conclusions: Early results of the MUCKI study support the feasibility of combined resistance and endurance training and evaluation of muscular strength during ICT. PD-057 Polymorphisms in Immune Response Genes and Risk of Infection during Treatment of Pediatric Acute Leukemia E. Zhukovskaya1, M. Avdonina 2, D. Fesenko3, T. Lisitsa1, T. Immunology, Genetic department, Moscow, Russia; 3Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology Russian Academy of Sciences Moscow, Genetic department, Moscow, Russia Background/Objectives: Advances in the treatment of children with leukemia are mostly determined by the use of intensive chemotherapy. However, the therapy results in the suppression of immunity, which is a risk factor for the development of serious infectious complications, significantly worsening the prognosis of the underlying disease. The study of polymorphism of the genes involved in the regulation of immune response is a prospective direction. Design/Methods: DNA was isolated from leukocytes of 109 children with leukemia: 53 children with severe infections (group 1) and 56 children without complications during treatment (group 2). A microarray was designed to determine 14 SNPs reaction (PCR) with fluorescent labelling of DNA target followed by allelespecific hybridization on microarray and image analysis. Twosided Fisher's exact test was used for statistical analysis. Results: The genotype and allele frequencies between two groups of patients were compared. It was found that the minor allele 589T of the IL4 gene (rs2243250) was less frequent in patients of the group (1) than in patients of the group (2), thus conferring a decreased risk of infection (odds ratio OR= 0.46, p=0,03, 96% CI=0.230.92). The allele G of the IL7R gene (rs1494555) was more frequent in the group (1) regarding to the group (2) (OR = 2.02, p=0.02, 95% CI = 1.123.64). The combination of allele G (rs1494555) with allele T in the IL7R gene (rs1494558) strengthened this association: the haplotype GT was much more frequent in the group (1) than in the group (2) (OR=4.3, =0.002, 95% CI= rs1494558 and rs1494555 in the IL7R gene were identified as genetic markers that may influence on risk of developing infectious complications during treatment of pediatric leukemia. Treatment and Care Psychosocial (PPO) PD-058 Emotional Adjustment in Siblings After a Child's Death From Cancer: The Role of Extrafamilial Relationships K. Balistreri 1, M. Hagan1, M. Barrera2, T. Akard3, for Biobehavioral Health, Columbus, USA; 2The Hospital for Sick Children, Child Health Evaluative Sciences, Toronto, Canada; 3Vanderbilt University, Nursing, Nashville, USA; 4Vanderbilt University, Department of Psychology and Human Development, Nashville, USA; 5University of Colorado Denver, Biostatistics and Informatics, Denver, Children's Hospital, Department of Psychology, Columbus, USA; 7The Ohio State University, Pediatrics, Columbus, USA Background/Objectives: The death of a child from cancer is traumatic for families. Severe and prolonged parental grief may undermine family resources to meet the unique needs of surviving siblings. Therefore, extrafamilial social resources may assume particular importance. We examined whether relationships with peers and teachers mitigate risk for depression and internalizing symptoms for bereaved siblings. Design/Methods: Children (N=76, 58% female), aged 818 (Mage=12.47, SD=2.54) were recruited from three US/Canadian hospitals 312 months after their sibling's death from cancer. Nonbereaved comparisonclassmates (CC) were also recruited (N=73). At school, classmates rated how much they liked each other, yielding mean Peer Acceptance scores. At home visits, children completed the Social Support Scale for Children and Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) and parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist. Regression analyses tested variance in Depression/Internalizing symptoms accounted for by group, extrafamilial relationships, and their interactions. Results: Groups did not differ in perceptions of Peer, Teacher, and Friend support or Peer Acceptance. Peer and Friend Support were negatively associated with both Depressive/Internalizing Symptoms, and Teacher Support was negatively associated with Depressive Symptoms, regardless of group (Bs=0.84 0.38, SEs=0.120.24, ps<0.05). Peer Acceptance Internalizing Symptoms (B=2.27, SE=1.04, p=0.03). A significant interaction was found between Group and Peer Acceptance predicting Depressive Symptoms (B=2.18, SE=1.03, p=.035) in which bereaved siblings reported elevated CDI scores regardless of Peer Acceptance (p=.83), but a negative association was found for CC (B=2.34, SE=0.76, p=0.002). Conclusions: Bereaved siblings appear to maintain peer acceptance and support from peers, teachers, and friends, and extrafamilial support benefits bereaved siblings and nonbereaved CC. In contrast, selfreported depressive symptoms were elevated for bereaved siblings whether or not they were 'wellliked' by classmates. Future research should seek to elucidate the directionality of these associations and identify factors that undermine perceptions as well as availability of extrafamilial support. PD-059 Training and Education in Paediatric Oncology - Current Perspectives from the Literature C. Barton 1 1Alder Hey Children's Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Paediatric Oncology, Liverpool, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: Clinical training and education programmes for trainees and fellows in paediatric oncology are variable between countries, and between centres within single nations. Standards are however established as far as possible to ensure that trainees acquire relatively uniform experience and knowledge. This study reported here describes current perspectives on the delivery and assessment of training in paediatric oncology as described in recent literature. Design/Methods: The NHS evidence portal was used to search PubMed, PsychINFO, Embase and CINHAL using clearly defined search terms. Where possible, these terms were match to the MESH/encyclopaedia of each database. Results: Of 172 results, 38 were included as directly relevant to the delivery and assessment of paediatric oncology education and training. Countries from all five continents were represented, but weighted significantly towards higher income countries. Problems that trainees experience in receiving their training include lack of time, focus on service provision, and heterogeneous case exposure relative to other trainees, difficulty gaining experience in centres with other tertiary and quaternary speciality services, and establishing and maintaining worklife balance. Particular areas where there was an identified need for greater experience included the presentation of brain tumours, survivorship and late effects, and palliative care. Particular challenges in the assessment of paediatric oncology trainees include heterogeneous career paths (e.g. less than full time training, academic research, and maternity leave), a lack of validated patient/family assessment tools, communication, differences in the structure of training programs and lack of formal qualifications. Conclusions: The ability of paediatric oncologists to travel between countries and continents for research and employment is testament to the validity of professional certifications in the speciality despite a lack of formal assessment. Further research in the area should focus on common and successful themes in paediatric oncology programs. PD-060 The Perceived Impact of Pediatric Cancer on Parental Couples' Psychological Status and Relationship Satisfaction During the Survivorship Period W. Burns 1,2, K. P\u00e9loquin1, Montr\u00e9al, Canada; 3Universit\u00e9 Pediatrics, Montr\u00e9al, Canada Background/Objectives: Followup studies suggest that the psychosocial impact of pediatric cancer on parents often extends beyond the end of their child's cancer treatments, and parents can continue to experience both individual and dyadic (couplebased) effects. In a longterm study of parents of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), we aimed to: 1) describe couples' adjustment (psychological distress, relationship adjustment), 2) describe the perceived impact of cancer on couples' relationships, and 3) identify to what extent the perceived impact of cancer on the couple is related to both parents' longterm adjustment. Design/Methods: Participants in this study were childhood ALL survivors and their parents, who were in 'intact' couples (i.e. together during the illness and at recall) (n =100). Survivors' medical information was collected from medical records and parents completed questionnaires (Brief Symptom Inventory18, abbreviated Dyadic Adjustment Scale, and Impact of Cancer on the Couple). Mothers and fathers' scores were compared (e.g., repeatedmeasures MANOVAs). Using the ActorPartner Interdependence Model (APIM), we examined the degree to which a parent's perceived changes in relationship dynamics were associated with their own adjustment (actor effects), and their partner's adjustment (partner effects). Results: Distress was normative in this sample of parents with frequencies ranging from 220%. Generally, mothers and fathers agreed on their reported relationship satisfaction, and the perceived nature of relationship changes (positive, negative, or no change) following the illness. Findings from dyadic models indicate that while mothers' adjustment was selfrelated (relating to their perceived relationship changes), fathers' adjustment was primarily otherrelated (relating to their partner's perceptions). Conclusions: Given our findings, it appears that mothers may act as a bridge connecting illness experiences of survivors and fathers. This could explain why mothers' perceptions of relationship changes influence their partners' longterm adjustment, but the reverse is not true for fathers. Acknowledgments: Cole Foundation (Montreal), CIHR, FRQs PD-061 A Longitudinal Examination of Factors Associated with Friendships in Pediatric Brain Tumor Survivors L. Desjardins 1, U. Bartels1, D. Cataudella2, J. Hancock1, A. Saleh1, M. 1The Hospital for Sick Children, Psychology, Toronto, Canada; 2London Health Sciences Center, HematologyOncology, London, Canada; 3British Columbia Hospital, Psychology, Vancouver, Canada; of Colorado Denver, Biostatistics & Informatics, Denver, USA Background/Objectives: Pediatric brain tumor survivors (PBTSs) experience impairments in social competence. Anxious and depressive symptoms, insult related variables (e.g., diagnosis, treatment), noninsult related variables (e.g., age, gender), and social information processing (e.g., executive functions, social skills, emotional control) may be associated with social competence in PBTSs. The current study examined longitudinal associations between baseline variables and peer nominated friendships in PBTSs approximately one year later. Design/Methods: Caregivers of children (n = 32) ages 816 (39% low grade glioma, 34% medulloblastoma, 28% other) completed ratings of child adjustment at baseline (T1) and PBTSs and classmates completed the Three Best Friends measure approximately 12 months later (T2). Preliminary descriptive statistics examined friendship nominations and reciprocated friendships of PBTSs. Bivariate analyses examined associations between baseline independent (anxious and depressive symptoms, emotional control, global executive composite, total social skills, diagnosis, treatment, age, gender) and T2 dependent variables (friendships). Results: On average, PBTSs were nominated as a best friend by two classmates (range: 07). Of the PBTSs, 25% were not nominated by any classmates as a best friend. On average, PBTSs had one reciprocated best friend nomination (range: 03). Of the PBTSs, 47% did not have any reciprocated best friend nominations. Greater depressive symptoms in PBTSs were associated with fewer peer nominations of friendship (r = .41, p < .02) and a no reciprocal friendships (t = 2.30, p < .03). Fewer social skills were also associated with not having any reciprocated friendships (t = 2.36, p < .03). Conclusions: Depressive symptoms and social skills at baseline were associated with friendship in PBTSs a year later, within the context of a multifaceted model. This information contributes to further our understanding of social competence and could guide psychosocial interventions for these survivors. PD-062 The Impact of School Climate on The Peer Relationships of Pediatric Brain Tumor Survivors M. Hagan 1, K. Balistreri1, E. Meadows2, E. for Biobehavioral Health, Columbus, USA; 2University of Toledo, Department of Psychology, Toledo, USA; 3Georgia State University, Department of Psychology, Atlanta, USA; 4The Ohio State University, Pediatrics, Columbus, USA; 5Hospital for Sick Children, Child Health Evaluative Sciences, Toronto, Canada; 6DanaFarber Cancer Institute at Harvard Medical Center, Divsion of Pediatric Oncology, Boston, USA Background/Objectives: Pediatric brain tumor survivors (PBTS) are at risk for negative peer interactions, less acceptance, and fewer friends relative to healthy peers. Family influences on social competence have been explored, but relevant features of school climate (e.g., structure, safety, peer and teacher support) have not. Our aim was to investigate PBTS, comparison classmate (CC) and teacher perceptions of schools and explore whether school climate moderates the peer relationship problems for PBTS. Design/Methods: PBTS (N=85, 53% male), aged 813 (Mage=10.8, year post treatment (40% radiation, 51% chemotherapy, 78% neurosurgery), were recruited from three sites in the US and Canada. PBTS, classmates (87% participation) and teachers completed the Delaware School Climate Survey and sociometric measures of peer interactions (Revised Class Play), acceptance, and friendship. One CC, matched for gender, age, and race, was identified in each class. Dependent ttests compared school climate ratings for PBTS and CC, and correlations examined agreement of students and teachers. Results: PBTS did not view school climate more negatively than CC (0.08 < p's < 0.83), and they had moderate agreement on studentstudent relations, student engagement, and school safety subscales (r= 0.33 to 0.43, p's < 0.01). Little agreement was found for teacher and student ratings of school climate. Further multivariate analyses will test if the difference between student and teacher perceptions of school climate moderate differences in peer interactions, acceptance, and friendship for PBTS and CC. Conclusions: Findings suggest that despite the negative peer experiences of PBTS, they do not perceive their school climate differently from CC. However, there is substantial disagreement between students and teachers, highlighting the importance of gathering information from students about school climate, rather than just teachers and administrators. Integrated perceptions of classmates may provide the most reliable estimates of school level variables that may mitigate social risk for PBTS. PD-063 Prospective Family Influences on Neurocognitive Functioning in Pediatric Brain Tumor Survivors M. Hocking 1, Y. Li1, L. Quast1, J. USA; 2Nemours Children's Health System, Nemours Center for Healthcare Delivery Science, Wilmington DE, USA Background/Objectives: Pediatric brain tumor survivors (PBTS) are at risk for neurocognitive deficits. A theoretical model of childhood cancer survivorship suggests associations between family functioning and survivor neurocognitive outcomes over time. This prospective study tested the hypothesis that better family functioning at the end of tumordirected treatment would be associated with positive changes in survivor neurocognitive function 9 and 16 months later. Design/Methods: Fifty PBTS (ages 616) completed brief neurocognitive assessments within four months of completing tumordirected therapy (T1) and again approximately nine (T2; n=35) and 16 (T3; n=30) months later. Parents completed measures of family functioning at T1. Neurocognitive domains assessed included working memory, processing speed, and longterm auditory memory. Family functioning factors assessed included general family functioning, condition management difficulty, and perceived caregiver competence. Mixedeffects models evaluated whether T1 family functioning variables predicted slopes of changes in survivor neurocognitive function over time. Results: Models predicting longterm auditory memory were consistent with hypotheses. Better caregiver competence at T1, t (1, 54)=2.52, p < .05, and less condition management difficulty, t (1, 55)=2.54, p < .05, were associated with faster improvements in auditory memory over time. Models predicting working memory were in the opposite direction than hypothesized. Worse caregiver competence at T1, t (1, 48)=2.43, p < .05, and greater condition management difficulty at T1, t (1, 48)=3.32, p < .01, were associated with faster improvements in working memory over time. Models predicting processing speed were not significant. Conclusions: Family functioning variables at the end of tumordirected treatment may play a role in the trajectory of survivor neurocognitive function over time. The nature of the role and which aspects of family functioning should be considered need further study, particularly with longer followup after the conclusion of tumordirected treatment. Family functioning is an important factor to monitor over time. PD-064 Never Truth without Hope, Never Hope without Truth: Parents'views on the Disclosure of Prognosis in Paediatric Oncology 1, Pozna, Department, Bydgoszcz, Poland Background/Objectives: Identification of the needs and preferences for the process of prognostic discussion among parents in paediatric oncology Design/Methods: Parents of children treated in three oncological centers in Poland participated in one of six focus group discussions and completed a survey measuring their preferences for the manner of delivery of prognostic information.To develop survey items, key themes were abstracted from the published literature. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Qualitative data were audiotaped and analyzed. Results: 116 (80%) of 144 parents invited onto the study participated.The majority of parents preferred detailed prognostic information, presented in an open and honest manner. Factors found to influence parents hope were physician willingness to answer questions and provide information offer the most up to date treatment and provide emotional support. Conversely, factors reported as potentially decreasing hope included pessimistic attitude, an impersonal context for the disclosure, the doctor appearing to be nervous or uncomfortable or using euphemisms. Parents preferred positive framing during the discussion about their child's prognosis. 112 (97%) of parents wanted their doctor to provide an opportunity to ask questions, and acknowledge them as an individual when discussing prognosis. Conclusions: The majority of parents preferred an individualized realistic approach from the doctor. Preferences may vary according to demographic, psychological and disease variables. Study findings highlight the importance of training healthcare professionals in the content, timing, and potential biases associated with information delivery. PD-065 A Survey to Assess Impact of an Innovative Educational Interventional Program on Attitudes Towards Education in Children Treated in a Large Tertiary Cancer Center S. Jatia 1, S. Imade1, J. Gupta1, U. Pandit1, Foundation Oncology Division, Mumbai, India; 2Tata Memorial Center, Pediatric Oncology Division, Mumbai, India Background/Objectives: Children undergoing treatment at our center a large tertiary cancer hospital in India, come from all parts of the country with diverse socioeconomic backgrounds, educational status, religiousbeliefs, vernacular languages, and deepset family/community traditions. The diagnosis of cancer and its aftermath makes education their lowest priority. Since May2015, we instituted an innovative educational interventional program run by a professional teachers group, designed for outpatient clinic waiting areas, largely through visual, auditory and skillbased means reducing dependence on language and able to cater to wide agegroups. A short survey was conducted to assess its impact on attitudes to education. Design/Methods: Children attending outpatient clinics at the center for treatment or followup, were issued a standard onepage questionnaire over a twoweek period in Mar2017. Participation was voluntary. Background information, attendance status at the educational program and attitudes to further schooling, future ambition, and time taken/ intent to rejoin school were assessed. Results: Fivehundred forms were distributed in the studyperiod, 414 responded, of which 313 had attended the program, while 101 did not. Both groups were evenlymatched for age (median8 years), sexratio (1.8 vs 1.72), treatment status (72% and 78% ontreatment), prior school attendance (84% and 78%), medium of instruction (English 37% and 35%; Hindi, Marathi, Bengali and others 63% and 65%). More than 80% among those on followup joined back school in both groups. In a question on future career, only 41% of nonattendees responded, as compared to 85% attendees (p<0.05). Career choices were more diverse in attendees than nonattendees (28 and 4 respectively), with Doctor being most popular in both. Attendees had more specific, specialized, nichearea and exotic career preferences than nonattendees. Conclusions: An innovative educational interventional program run in outpatient waiting areas impacted preferences towards future education and career with attendees having more positive, open and diverse attitudes than nonattendees. PD-066 Feasibility of InHospital Ambassador Classmates for Children with Cancer as Facilitators of Social, Physical, and Educational Rehabilitation (Respect) H.B. Larsen at rehabilitating schoolaged children with cancer socially, academically, physically and diminish their treatment induced isolation and marginalization, the nationwide psychosocial intervention study RESPECT (Rehabilitation including social and physical activity and education in children and teenagers with cancer) have included children since 2013. Intervention: 1. A 60minutes educational presentation on cancer in the child\u00b4s school class, 2. Alternating inhospital coadmission (9am3pm) of two ambassador classmates, 3. Inhospital physical activity program. Purpose: To examine the feasibility of the educational and ambassador intervention components of the ongoing RESPECT study. Design/Methods: Methods: Inclusion of the first 30 consecutive children (618 years) newly diagnosed with cancer in the intervention group. Feasibility include: participation rate, acceptability, timeframe, frequency, duration and safety. Results: Results Of 31 children 30 consented to participate (97%). Median time from diagnosis to inclusion was six days. Within a median of 14 days the educational class presentation on cancer was conducted, with >90 % teacher's satisfaction with content, level and duration. A median of seven classmates applied for ambassadorship. Median time for ambassador assignments to all children was nine days. The median oneway ambassador travel distance was 49 km. None of the patients or ambassadors discontinued study participation. None of the ambassadors experienced adverse emotional reactions or needed psychological intervention. The total number of ambassador coadmissions was 422 and the median number of coadmissions per child was 13. Conclusions: Conclusion: It is feasible, acceptable and safe to involve healthy classmates during intensive treatment of children with cancer. The intervention components are well suited for rehabilitation intervention in children with cancer and their school classes. Challenges are practical organization, travel distance, coadmissions, parental language barriers, inhospital cultural acceptability and disease burden. The inclusion of classmates as psychosocial motivational supportive network during inhospital cancer treatment provides a novel approach to cancer rehabilitation of schoolaged children. PD-067 Psychosocial Screening for Siblings of Children with Cancer: Development and Initial Testing of a New Sibling Screening Module K. Long 1, E. Pariseau1, A.C. Muriel2, A. Chu3, A. Kazak4,5, M. Psychological and Brain Sciences, Boston, USA; 2Dana Farber Cancer Institute & Harvard Medical School, Pediatric Psychosocial Oncology, Boston, USA; 3Boston University, School of Public Health, Boston, USA; 4Nemours Children's Health System, Center for Healthcare Delivery Science, Wilmington, USA; 5Thomas Jefferson University, Sidney Kimmel Medical College, Philadelphia, USA Background/Objectives: The absence of a standardized, siblingspecific psychosocial screener limits healthcare providers' ability to identify and preemptively intervene with siblings who may have clinical levels of distress during or after a brother's/sister's cancer treatment. English and Spanish versions of a sibling module for the Psychosocial Assessment Tool (PAT), a wellvalidated screener of family psychosocial risk, were developed. The project also examined associations between sibling risk factors and sibling and family adjustment. Design/Methods: English and Spanishspeaking families of children with cancer (29 parents, 17 siblings) participated in qualitative interviews to inform item content and provide indepth feedback on the wording and format of iterative versions of the new PAT Sibling Module. Purposive sampling ensured variability across sibling age (M(SD)=8.9(4.7) years), sibling gender (55% female), time since cancer diagnosis (M(SD)= 18.8(19.6) months), and parent primary language (34% Spanish/bilingual). Data collection continued until saturation was reached and the new screening modules were finalized. In Phase 2, parents of newlydiagnosed children with cancer completed the PAT Sibling Module and measures of sibling, parent, and family functioning. To date, 38 families have completed Phase 2. Results: Sixteen distinct PAT Sibling Modules were developed based on timing (diagnosis, followup), language (English, Spanish), and sibling age (02, 34, 59, 10+ years). Higher scores on the PAT Sibling Module (i.e., greater sibling risk) are associated with poorer sibling psychosocial functioning as assessed by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire Total Problem Scale (r=0.67, p=0.00), Emotion Symptoms Scale (r=0.40, Prosocial Scale (r= 0.56, p=0.01), and worse family functioning on the Family Assessment Device (r=0.63, p=0.00). Associations with parent mental health as assessed by the Brief Symptom Inventory were not significant. Conclusions: The new PAT Sibling Modules show promise as screeners of psychosocial risk among siblings of children with cancer. PD-068 Is a Brief Parental Intake form Effective in Identifying Behavioral Adjustment Problems in Childhood Cancer Survivors? A. Michaud 1, C. Cadigan1, C. Mason2, C. Recklitis1 Institute, Boston, USA; 2Imperial College London, Neuroepidemiology and Ageing, London, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: Childhood cancer survivors (CCS) are at elevated risk for behavioral adjustment problems. Screening is promoted as a means of identifying these problems, but practical and accurate screening methods for clinical settings are not well established. We developed a fiveitem Brief Parental Intake Form (BPIF) and assessed its accuracy compared to parental report on the Brief Pediatric Symptom Checklist17 (BPSC17). Design/Methods: Parents of 291 CCS (ages 517) completed the BPIF and BPSC17 at a survivorship visit. The BPIF asks parents to report on emotional, attention, behavioral, school and 'other' problems on a 4point likert scale. The BPSC17 includes 3 scales capturing depression/internalizing, attention, and externalizing problems. Based on normative data, BPSC17 scores were categorized into no significant elevation, moderate elevation, and significant elevation. Results: Parents reported 87 (29.9%) survivors had moderate or significant elevation on the BPSC17. Of those, 83 survivors were identified as having at least some behavioral problems on the BPIF. Using any reported problem v. no problem as a cutoff on the BPIF showed high sensitivity (95.4%). For the 204 (70.1%) survivors whose parents did not report behavioral problems on the BPSC17, 93 did screen in on the BPIF, showing low specificity (54.4%). Conclusions: Parental report on the BPIF accurately identified symptomatic cancer survivors with high sensitivity compared to the BPSC17. The fiveitem BPIF could lessen the burden for both patient and staff, while still identifying 95% of survivors with behavioral problems. Because of low specificity, the BPSC17 or another more detailed measure should be used as a second screener for survivors who screened in on the BPIF. Future studies should compare the BPIF with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and other measures, to see how accurately it identifies behavioral problems more broadly. PD-069 Assessment of Information Needs and Intervention Preferences in Parents of Survivors with Neurocognitive Late Effects C. Peterson 1, N. Morris1 1Eastern Michigan University, Psychology, Ypsilanti, USA Background/Objectives: With approximately half of childhood cancer survivors (CCS) at risk for neurocognitive late effects (NCLE)1, parents report high need for information about learning and behavior, but in varying amounts and stages2. Understanding specific survivorship information needs, such as preferences for the amount, timing, type, and delivery of information needed, will inform intervention. This study assessed parent information needs and intervention preferences, associations with psychological functioning, and perceived utility of Internetbased information interventions. Design/Methods: Ninetyfive parents of CCS completed measures of demographic/treatment information, child behavior and neurocognitive functioning, family burden, knowledge of NCLE, current and preferred sources of survivorship information, and interest in using Internetbased resources. Results: Parents reported low information: 30% had never heard of NCLE, and 70.5% wanted \"a lot\" more information about NCLE. Only 26% reported receiving information at diagnosis; 34.7% reported finding information on their own or \"never\" receiving information. Parents wanted information immediately after diagnosis and before treatment consent, and again 12 months before concluding treatment. Parents reported frequent reliance on other sources besides their medical team (e.g., internet, other parents) and need for repeated information at more frequent intervals in survivorship. Topics included: sibling and communicating about late effects with their team. 93.7% of respondents would use an online program if available. Regression analyses indicated that greater survivorship information needs were associated with increased family burden and poorer child cognitive, behavioral, and emotional functioning. Family burden specific to NCLE significantly predicted information needs (B = .10, SE = .03, p = .001), beyond demographic and treatment variables. Conclusions: Families report high needs for information throughout survivorship, strongly predicted by the burden a parent experiences managing late effects. Results indicate targets for interventions for highly burdened parents that would be feasible, acceptable, and disseminable.

St. Olav's University Hospital, Trondheim, Norway; 8Norwegian University of Science and Technology NTNU, Department of Psychology. St. Olav's University Hospital, Trondheim, Norway Background/Objectives: This study investigated the healthrelated quality of life (HRQOL) and psychological distress of adolescent and young adult (AYA) survivors of childhood cancer and the association of these factors with treatment modalities, education and demographic factors 5 years postdiagnosis. Design/Methods: Participants included cancer survivors (n=91) recruited through the Cancer Registry of Norway (CRN) and healthy controls (n=223) recruited from a student population. All participants completed selfreport questionnaires, and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) 4.0 and Hopkins Symptom Checklist10 (HSCL10) were used to measure HRQOL and distress, respectively. Results: Survivors reported the same mean levels of HRQOL as controls, with the exception of worse physical functioning. Compared with controls, survivors overall and female survivors in particular had higher odds of reporting psychological distress symptoms over the cutoff, but survivors did not have higher mean levels of distress. Female survivors reported poorer physical health than female controls. Survivors reporting distress levels above the cutoff had significantly poorer HRQOL regarding physical functioning and worse total PedsQL scores than controls scoring above the cutoff. Age (for HRQOL only), female gender, low educational level and perceived low economic status significantly predicted HRQOL and distress. Conclusions: Survivors reported similar mean levels of HRQOL and distress as controls, except for physical functioning. For cancer survivors, demographic variables predicted HRQOL and distress. Some groups of survivors require closer followup, and more attention should be paid to factors associated with poor HRQOL and psychological distress in survivors, including female gender, lower education level and lower income.

PD-071 Anxiety Symptoms and Neurocognitive Functioning in Children with Leukemia and Brain Tumors: A Comparison of Symptomology across Multiple Informants C. Sharkey 1, A. Gioia2, T. Kennedy2, G. Dome2, Stillwater, 2Children's National Health System, Neurology, Washington DC, USA Background/Objectives: Children diagnosed with cancer may experience both psychological and neurocognitive difficulties, yet few studies have examined the relationship between these outcomes. However, adjustment difficulties, including anxiety, can contribute to poor cognitive performance. Thus, the present retrospective study aimed to compare the relationship between anxiety symptoms and neurocognitive functioning in children with leukemia or brain tumors (BT). Due to the importance of multiple informants, concordance across raters was also assessed. Design/Methods: Ninetyseven children with leukemia (45.4% Female, M age=11.61 years), and 121 children with brain tumor (48.8% Female, M age=11.21 years) completed the Youth SelfReport and an ageappropriate Wechsler scale, as part of a clinical neuropsychological assessment. Parents (N=208) and teachers (N=157) completed Achenbach rating scales. Results: BT survivors had significantly lower processing speed than leukemia survivors (x2(177) =2.78, p<.01). Although no differences existed in overall anxiety across survivorship groups, there were differences in rater agreement between leukemia and BT groups. Specifically, BT survivors' selfreported anxiety correlated with parentreport correlated with parentreport (p<.05). Contrastingly, among leukemia survivors, parent, teacher, and selfreport of anxiety were unrelated (p>.05). Among BT survivors, reports of anxiety were unrelated to cognitive performance (p>.05), whereas among leukemia survivors, parent and selfreport of Anxious/Depressed symptoms were positively associated with working memory and IQ (.01<p<.05), and parentreport of Anxiety Problems was positively related to IQ (p<.01). Teacher and selfreport of Anxiety Problems were positively related to processing speed (p<.01). Conclusions: The relationship between anxiety symptoms and cognitive performance, and the concordance between multiple informants of anxiety symptoms differs between BT and leukemia groups. Selfreport is associated with quantitative cognitive performance within leukemia, although in an unexpected direction, yet is more concordant with otherreports in BT. Thus, multiple informants are essential and further investigation of this positive relationship between anxiety symptoms and neurocognitive functioning is warranted among leukemia survivors. PD-072 A Pilot RCT Targeting Caregivers to Improve the Health Behaviors of Obese Pediatric Cancer Survivors M. and Family Studies, Tampa, USA; 2University of South Florida, psychology, Tampa, USA; 3University of South Florida, School Psychology, Tampa, USA; Children's Hospital, Pediatric Oncology, St Petersburg, USA; of Pittsburgh, Psychiatry Psychology and Pediatrics, Pittsburgh, USA; 6Virginia Commonwealth University, Psychology, Richmond, USA Background/Objectives: Objective: Obesity rates in pediatric cancer survivors (PCS) are alarmingly high (4050%). Healthy lifestyle changes may prevent future health complications and improve quality of life in PCS. Few interventions have addressed the negative impact of cancer therapies on PCS health behaviors. This NIH funded RCT tests the efficacy of a parentfocused intervention (NOURISHT) on improving caregiver and child bmi, dietary intake, and physical activity than caregivers in our control (EUC). Design/Methods: Methods: A total of 67 PCS from two sites were consented and 53 were enrolled (M=9.92yrs of age, 64.4% ALL or lymphoma diagnosis) at least 6 months off cancer treatment (M=1.96yrs off treatment), and BMI of 85th% percentile or greater BMI randomized to either a 6session intervention, NOURISHT, or one Enhanced Usual Care (EUC) session. Assessments were conducted at baseline, post6weeks intervention and 4month followup (FU). Results: Results In comparison to EUC parents, NOURISHT parents showed significant decreases from pre to post to FU on BMI, waisthip ratio and total number of daily calories. NOURISHT parents also showed similar positive changes in their child feeding behaviors and perceptions of child vulnerability. Similar decreases on BMI %ile and waisthip ratio were found for PCS, but only from pre to post testing. NOURISHT PCS also showed significant increases in number of daily steps whereas EUC PCS decreased. Caregivers reported being very positive about NOURISHT sessions. Conclusions: Conclusions Results suggest that an intervention targeting parents can have a longer term effect on caregivers, but only shorterterm impact on the PCS. Implications for intervention strategies are discussed. Whether length of time off treatment plays a moderating factor on treatment effects will be considered. PD-073 Attitudes Towards Clinical Trials among Adolescents and Young Adults (AYA) with A History of Cancer: Psychosocial Maturity, Knowledge and DiseaseRelated Correlates E. Vel\u00e1zquezMartin1, L. Schwartz1,2, L.P. Barakat1,2 1The Children's Division of Oncology, Philadelphia, USA; 2The University of Pennsylvania, Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, USA Background/Objectives: Relative to younger cohorts, the progress in rate of survival has been slower for adolescents and young adults ages 1529 (AYA). Barriers to clinical trial enrollment may include limited knowledge of clinical trials, which may relate to limited engagement in the treatment decisionmaking process, and difficulty of health care providers and caregivers to include them in shared decisionmaking. This study sought to explore psychosocial maturity, knowledge and disease related correlates of attitudes towards clinical trials. Design/Methods: AYA completed measures of demographics, cancer diagnosis/treatment, knowledge of clinical trials, psychosocial maturity (consideration of future consequences), and attitudes (perceived benefits and barriers) towards clinical trial participation. Covariates included age, age at diagnosis, sex, cancer type (liquid, solid or brain) and treatment status (on/off treatment). Preliminary ttests, correlations and ANOVAs were conducted. Multivariable regressions and mediation/moderation analyses were used for hypothesis testing. Results: Ninetyeight AYA (Mean age = 22.86, SD = 4.33; 55% Male, 86% nonHispanic White) had mean knowledge score of 80.77% correct (SD=13.84). Most frequent incorrect items included types of trials and voluntariness. Greater knowledge was significantly associated with more perceived benefits (b=0.69, p<0.001); this relationship was significantly moderated by cancer type. Knowledge mediated the relationship between consideration of future consequences and perceived benefits (Z=2.07, p=0.04). Cancer type was the only identified predictor of perceived barriers; AYA with brain tumors (Mean=46.42, SD=8.91) perceived significantly more barriers compared to those with liquid tumors (Mean=40.31, SD=10.32, p=0.04). Conclusions: AYA have moderate knowledge of cancer clinical trials with critical areas of misunderstanding. Informed consent processes should be tailored towards psychosocial maturity and address perceived benefits and barriers that may differ by diagnosis. Decision support tools may be effective resources to improve knowledge, enhance full understanding of clinical trials and their potential benefits, and increase AYA engagement in their treatment decisions. PD-074 IMPACT of Family Density on IllnessRelated Parental Adjustment and Family Burden in Survivorship P. Weaver 1, C. Peterson1 1Eastern Michigan University, Clinical Psychology, Ypsilanti, USA Background/Objectives: Research has shown marital status and family size to be commonly endorsed psychosocial risk factors for families of children newly diagnosed with cancer.1 However, for families of children with a chronic illness, research suggests that family density is a more objective indicator of the demands on parental resources as compared to singleparent status.2 Late effects in childhood cancer survivors (CCS), particularly neurocognitive late effects (NCLE), may present ongoing demands that burden parents.3 Negative psychosocial outcomes for families of survivors may be exacerbated in high density families. The present study examined associations among illnessrelated parental adjustment and family burden, moderated by family density, in parents of CCS. Design/Methods: Ninetythree parents (96% mothers) of CCS completed measures assessing perceived emotional resources, parent guilt/worry, and family burden of NCLE, in addition to demographic and diseaserelated variables. Density was defined as the household's total childadult ratio, with atrisk identified as >2.4 In the current study 26% of families were dense. Results: Regression analyses revealed that parents reporting more perceived emotional resources reported significantly less guilt/worry (B=0.89, p<.001) and family burden (B=1.68, p=.002). Greater subjective experience of guilt/worry was associated with greater family burden (B=0.62, p=.005). Feelings of guilt/worry were associated with greater family burden for parents in higher density families (B=0.49, p=.037). However, despite family density, parents who perceived themselves as having sufficient emotional resources to manage the demands associated with their child's illness experienced less family burden. Findings were observed above and beyond the effects of socioeconomic status. Conclusions: Results highlight the buffering impact of perceived emotional resources in managing caregiver demands in CCS families, even within relatively higher density families. Interventions should focus on these high density families, as parents maybe at greater risk for experiencing feelings of guilt/worry that result in greater overall family burden. PD-075 Pediatric Cancer Patients in Malawi Present to the Hospital with Poor HealthRelated Quality of Life as Measured by the Promis25 Questionnaire K. Westmoreland 1,2, A. Amuquandoh3, T. van der Gronde3, S. Itimu3, Country Director, Lilongwe, Malawi; 7University of North Carolina, Health Policy and Management, Chapel Hill, USA; 8UNC ProjectMalawi, Cancer Program Director, Lilongwe, Malawi; 9University of Carolina, Oncology and Infectious Disease, Chapel Hill, USA; 10University of Malawi School of Medicine, Oncology and Infectious Malawi Background/Objectives: PatientReported Outcomes Measurement Information System 25item (PROMIS25) pediatric questionnaire was translated into Chichewa and validated for use in Malawi. This is among the first studies from subSaharan Africa (SSA) to report healthrelated quality of life (HRQoL) for pediatric cancer patients. Design/Methods: Thirtytwo pediatric lymphoma patients were interviewed at Kamuzu Central Hospital in Lilongwe, Malawi. The PROMIS25 questionnaire was administered to patients within three days of presentation before chemotherapy initiation. Participants reported on six HRQoL domains (mobility, anxiety, depression, fatigue, peer relationships, and pain interference) by answering four question items per domain using a 5point Likert scale. A singleitem pain intensity question was scored 010. Each domain was transformed to a Tscore with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10 based on the original PROMIS reference sample. Median and interquartile range (IQR) for Tscores was reported for each domain. A ttest was used to compare our cohort to published Tscores of 203 pediatric cancer patients in the United States. Results: Thirtytwo patients completed the baseline questionnaire. The median age was 9 years (IQR 612). Children reported very low levels of mobility (median: 28, IQR: 2337), high anxiety (median: high fatigue (median: 62, IQR: satisfaction with peer relationships (median: 52, IQR: 4455), and high pain interference (median: 63, IQR: 5568). The highest score for pain intensity of 10 was given by 22/32 (68%) of patients. When compared to a United States pediatric cancer population, the Malawi cohort had statistically significant worse HRQoL in mobility, anxiety, depression, fatigue, and pain interference domains (p<0.05). Conclusions: Baseline HRQoL for pediatric lymphoma patients in Malawi is poor for all HRQoL domains except peer relationships. This emphasizes an urgent need for clinical and research programs to specifically address HRQoL among children undergoing cancer treatment in SSA. PD-076 Delirium: A Prospective Study within the Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, and Bone Marrow Transplant Population (PHO) at a Single Institution K. Winsnes 1, E. Shereck1, M. Recht1, C. Loret De L. 1Oregon University, Pediatric Hematology / Oncology, Portland, USA; 2Oregon Health and Science University, Pediatric Critical Care, Portland, USA; 3Oregon Health and Science University, Pediatric Psychiatry, Portland, USA Background/Objectives: Delirium affects 1030% of patients in pediatric intensive care units (PICU) and causes increased length of stay, decreased attention in school, and posttraumatic stress disorder. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM V) defines delirium as a \"disturbance of consciousness [...] with reduced ability to focus, sustain or shift attention\" due to an underlying medical condition. Hypothesizing that delirium is under recognized in the PHO population, we designed a prospective study using a validated screening tool to determine the frequency of delirium in hospitalized PHO patients and to identify associated clinical factors. Design/Methods: The baseline frequency of delirium diagnosis was determined using a data mining program of electronic medical records (EMR). PHO and PICU nurses have been trained to use the Richmond Assessment and Sedation Scale (RASS) and the Cornell Assessment for Pediatric Delirium. All PHO patients on the inpatient unit and in the PICU are screened for delirium once every 12hour shift and the scores are entered into the EMR. Additionally, specific variables are collected on each patient to help identify potential risk factors for delirium. Results: The frequency of delirium diagnosis in 2015 was 4.5%: 17/379 unique patients on the PHO unit and/or PICU. A 3month prestudy feasibility phase identified 5 unique patients among 49 (10%) with a positive delirium screen, one which prompted psychiatric intervention. Two months into the yearlong prospective study, which began Jan 2017, 78 unique patients among 135 consecutive cases have enrolled; 7 pts (9%) had a positive delirium screening. Initial analysis will occur at six months. Conclusions: Delirium exists in the PHO population, however its frequency is yet to be determined. Routine delirium screening should improve our recognition and diagnosis of delirium and, thereby, allow us to promptly intervene or prevent delirium in order to avoid potential long term consequences. PD-077 What Do Adolescents and Young Adults Want from Cancer Resources? B. Zebrack 1, C. Cheung2 1University of Michigan, School of Social Work, Ann Arbor, USA; 2University of California Los Angeles, Department of Social Welfare, Los Angeles, USA Background/Objectives: As clinicians are encouraged to provide personalized and patientcentered care, inclusion of the patient's voice as a component of evidence generation is critical. The primary purpose of this study was to assess adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer patients' preferences for cancer information and support resources. Design/Methods: Utilizing a modified Delphi technique, AYA cancer patients identified barriers to optimal AYA cancer care, cancer resources that address their needs, and specific characteristics of cancer resources they find helpful. The Delphi panel consisted of a convenience sample of 21 patients aged 1839 years, who were diagnosed with cancer between ages 1539 years and were no more than eight years out from cancer treatment at the time of the study. Survey data were collected in three consecutive and iterative rounds over the course of six months in 2015. Results: Findings indicated that AYA patients prefer resources that reduce feelings of loneliness, create a sense of community or belonging, and provide opportunities to meet other AYA patients. Among the top barriers to optimal cancer care, AYAs identified a lack of cancer care providers specializing in AYA care, a lack of connection to an AYA patient community, and their own lack of ability to navigate the health system. Participants also described aspects of cancer information and supportive care resources that they believe address AYAs' concerns. Conclusions: Information derived from this study will help developers of cancer information and support resources better reach their intended audience. From the point of view of AYA cancer patients, optimal cancer care and utilization of information and support resources requires that cancer support programs foster meaningful connections among AYA patients. Results also suggest that patient resources should equip AYAs with practical knowledge and skills necessary to navigate the health system and advocate for themselves. Treatment and Care Nursing PD-078 Memory AIDS: Assistive Tools for Pediatric Oncology Nurses in Patient Care Area from Indus Children Cancer Hospital, Pakistan S. Anwarali 1, R. Punjwani1, B. Ahmed1 1Indus Children Cancer Hospital, Nursing Education Service, Karachi, Pakistan Background/Objectives: Nurses are the pillar of any health care organization. They are the front line in providing care to patients. Many organizations seek to enhance the quality of patient care by improving nursing knowledge and competency. Pediatric oncology nurses working under pressure or novice nurses tend to miss small but valuable pieces of information which eventually can result in sentinel events. Thus, Indus Children Cancer Hospital Nursing Education Service in Karachi, Pakistan we created an essential memory aid- cue/flash cards- to help nurses as a reference guide. Design/Methods: An extensive literature review was conducted using key OR) words, all suggestive of the effectiveness of flashcards. Selective flashcards were made and printed for personal usage to nurses in clinical areas. Project shall be evaluated by qualitative approach by asking nurses how and which flash cards were beneficial. Results: Evidencebased nursing literature suggests that learning tools for nurses and other healthcare professionals are useful, effective and handy for referral to vital information. These memory aids have assisted novice nurses in learning and refreshing basic concepts and retaining knowledge and learnt skills. These aids have assisted nurses to perform better care with decreased number of sentinel events. Nurses benefit from memory aids for chemotherapy and medication calculation, vital signs, height and weight, basal surface area, pain assessment and management. Conclusions: Use of memory aids is an innovative way for ongoing learning in pediatric oncology clinical areas. The effectiveness of the flash cards will aid in referring to quick information required rather than making a mistake. The cards are used as a reference guide and precept pediatric oncology nurses and interns in clinical areas. The memory aids are expected to increase level of competency and confidence among pediatric oncology nurses to provide quality care. PD-079 Pediatric Nurses Knowledge on Chemotherapy at Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital R. Appiah 1 1Staff Nurse at Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital, Ghana Background: Chemotherapy is one of the effective treatments of most oncological conditions with chemo (anticancer drug) This study was undertaken to evaluate the knowledge on staff nurses at pediatric wards at Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital on chemotherapy. Methods: This study was a descriptive study structured questionnaire with both open and close ended questions were used. Systemic random sampling was used in selecting 100 respondents 40% of the respondent have knowledge on chemotherapy and the remaining 60% said they don't have knowledge on chemotherapy. Regarding the side effects, 45% have the knowledge and the remaining 55% said they don't have knowledge on it. For the specific chemo for treating specific types of oncological conditions 30% were able to give correct answer, 70% of the total respondent were not able to give correct answers. Results: At the end of the survey minority of the respondent have adequate knowledge on chemotherapy with a percentage of 40%, 45 % of the total respondents have adequate knowledge on side effect of chemotherapy and minority of the respondent have adequate knowledge on specific chemo for treating specific oncological condition/. Conclution: It is recommended that workshop and indept. service training session on chemotherapy should be organized for nursing staffs of pediatric wards at Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital. PD-080 A Systematic Review of the Gut Microbiome, TreatmentRelated Symptoms and Targeted Interventions in Children with Cancer J. Bai 1, M. Behera2,3, D. Bruner1,3 1Emory University, Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing, Atlanta, USA; 2Emory University, School of Medicine, Atlanta, USA; 3Emory University, Winship Cancer Institute, Atlanta, USA Background/Objectives: With the development of highthroughput DNA sequencing and bioinformatics technologies, a growing body of literature showed that the gut microbiome (GM) plays a critical role in maintaining children's health and in preventing and treating children's disease. Current application of the GM in childhood cancer is still unknown. This systematic review aimed at understanding the GM, its applications in gastrointestinal symptoms (GIS) and psychoneurological symptoms (PNS), and the efficacy of targeted interventions in children treated for cancer. Design/Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and the American Society of Clinical Oncology abstract were searched. Eligible studies included all study types in which the target population were children with cancer, the GM was studied as a primary or secondary outcome, and published in English. The Mixed Methods Assessment Tool was used to assess the methodological quality. Results: Seven studies met our eligibility criteria, including two casecontrol studies, two cohort studies, and three randomized controlled trails. Our findings showed that children with cancer showed a significantly lower diversity in the GM (e.g., Bifidobacteria, Lactobacillus, Clostridium XIVa and IV) than the healthy controls. The total counts of healthy GM (e.g., Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium) decreased significantly pre and postchemotherapy in children with cancer. Dysbiosis in the GM showed potential associations with GIS and PNS. Use of the probiotic (Bifidobacterium or Lactobacilli) and prebiotic supplementations (fructooligosaccharides) significantly improved dysbiosis of the GM, but did not significantly influence the adverse events (e.g., abdominal distention and diarrhea) in children treated for cancer. Conclusions: Children treated for cancer experienced dysbiosis of the GM, which can be improved by the prebiotic and probiotic supplementations. More studies are needed to investigate the relationships between the GM and GIS and PNS, and evaluate the effectiveness of prebiotic and probiotic interventions on dysbiosis of the GM in children with cancer. PD-081 ELearning as a Tool for Continuing Education of Nurses in Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation T. Bauters 1, J. De Munter2, S. Van Lancker1, T. Laureys1, A. 1Ghent Cell Transplantation, Ghent, Belgium; 2Ghent University Hospital, Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Ghent, Belgium Background/Objectives: The complexity of a Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) with the common toxicities and side effects, necessitates specific and continuing education and training for nurses and caregivers involved with HSCT. The aim of this project was to develop a basic educational framework for nurses, medical students and paramedics involved in pediatric and adult HSCT recipients. Design/Methods: An educational course in a format that is easily accessible online has been created. Results: The theoretical part consists of different topics: aim of HSCT, indications, donor/stem cell sources, different types of HSCT, ... each highlighting pediatric and adult issues. This is followed by a selfevaluation test, which can be used for accreditation purposes. Upon completion, users will be able to understand the process of HSCT, have knowledge of different conditioning regimens and will be able to identify the common side effects or toxicities related to HSCT. In addition, they will have insight in supportive care concepts and preventive or treatment strategies, making sure that the course meets local needs. Conclusions: The elearning tool allows nurses and caregivers involved in HSCT a more flexible learning, such as the option to choose the time and place to study, and provides electronic links to more detailed learning materials. Nurses who have completed the course will have a basic level of understanding of the principles of treatment and supportive care in HSCT patients. In the future, supplementary elessons and an advanced level elearning tool will be developed. PD-082 Risk Factors for NonAdherence to Treatment of Family Caregivers of Children with Cancer M. Cardenas 1 1Instituto Nacional De Cancerologia, Cundinamarca, Bogota, Colombia Background/Objectives: BACKGROUND: Two important factors (complete withdrawal and toxic deaths) associated with suboptimal service by health care providers, have been identified to explain the failure of treatments and differences in mortality among children with cancer in developed countries and the treaties in countries with economic limitations, one of them is the complete withdrawal of treatment. OBJECTIVES: Determine the risk factors for nonadherence to treatment of family caregivers of children with cancer at the National Cancer Institute. Design/Methods: Descriptive and transversal study, with quantitative approach, which participants are family caregivers of children with cancer. Implementation of two instruments, Survey characterization care dyad family caregiver - a person with a chronic disease of the National University of Colombia\u00b4s group of Chronic Care and the Instrument that evaluates the Factors that Influence the Adherence to the Pharmacological and NonPharmacological Treatments in Patients, designed and validated by Nursing. Results: The risk factors for nonadherence are identified such as, social and economic factors, related to the provider, the health system and equipment, related of therapy and / or treatment, related to the patient and related to the disease. Conclusions: The study pretends to intervene in a timely manner on the needs of families of children with cancer and in this way create lines of action in nursing to prevent nonadherence to treatments. PD-083 Changes of Nutritional Status and Associated Factors Among Chinese Pediatric Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Patients B. Zhang 1, N. Shen2, M. He1 1Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Nursing Department, Shanghai, China Background/Objectives: Growing evidences suggested that hematological and oncological disease, chemoradiotherapy during conditioning of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo HSCT) and related complications could induce metabolic change in nutrition, which not only declined patients' physical function but also predisposed them to nutritionrelated chronic illness. However, few studies have examined the changes of nutrition status and associated factors among Chinese pediatric allo HSCT patients. Design/Methods: This study was designed as a longitudinal study to determine the changes of nutritional status in 89 Chinese pediatric patients during pretransplant and posttransplant periods (pretransplant day, day+18, day+30, day+60, and day+100). Data were collected using a questionnaire survey including demographic information, anthropometric measurements and body composition. A repeated measure ANOVA was used to analyze the change of nutritional status, and mixed linear model was used to evaluate the associations of potential related factors. Results: During the first 100 days after HSCT, the anthropometric measurements BMIz (Body Mass Index z), TSF (triceps skin fold thickness) decreased significantly for the first 30 days (p<0.05)and then gradually increased (p<0.01). WC(waist circumference) demonstrated a gradually upward trend from pretransplant day to day +100 (p<0.01). The %BF(percent of body fat) increased significantly during the first 60 days after HSCT (p<0.01), with summit in the day +60. The change of TSF was associated with time, diagnosis, source of stem cell, HLA matching, and BMIz before transplantation. The change of WC was associated with time, gender, source of stem cell, HLA matching, and BMIz before transplantation. The change of %BF was associated with time, gender, HLA matching, and BMIz before transplantation. Conclusions: Nutritional status of Chinese pediatric allo HSCT patients changed significantly, and was associated with time, gender, diagnosis, source of stem cell, HLA matching, and BMIz before transplantation. The transplantation period witnessed an accumulation of body fat, and central obesity, especially in girls. PD-084 Predictors of the Posttraumatic Growth in Parents of Children with Leukemia S. Hong 1, H.R. Park2, S.H. Choi3 1Kangwon National University College of Health Science, Department of Nursing, Samcheoksi, Republic of Korea; 2The Catholic University of Korea, College of Nursing, Seoul, Republic of Korea; 3Seoul St. Mary's Hospital The Catholic University of Korea, BMT Center, Seoul, Republic of Korea Background/Objectives: Even though parenting a child with leukemia is a tremendous challenge that places struggle on caregivers, parents of children with leukemia experience positive outcomes. The purpose of this study was to identify predictors of posttraumatic growth in parents of children with leukemia. Design/Methods: Participants were 137 parents (117 mothers and 20 fathers) of children with leukemia recruited at C university hospital in Korea from May to August in 2016. Participants completed selfreport measures of posttraumatic growth, core belief, deliberate rumination, resilience, distress disclosure, social support, meaning in life and satisfaction with life. Results: All the variables except distress disclosure were positively correlated with posttraumatic growth. Resilience, core belief and social support were significant predictors related to posttraumatic growth in parents of children with leukemia and explained for 54% of the variance in posttraumatic growth. Conclusions: The results show that there are several factors affecting posttraumatic growth in parents of children with leukemia. Therefore, nursing intervention programs including strengthening resilience, revising core belief as well as utilizing social support system should be provide for this population in order to promote positive psychological change beyond parental traumatic events related to children with leukemia. PD-085 Development of a Virtual Reality Distraction Intervention for Youths with Cancer Undergoing Subcutaneous Port Accesses: A Usability Testing Study L. Jibb 1, J. Stinson2, A. Oussama3, K. Hum2, N. Juma6, P. Hroch7 1The University of Ottawa, School of Nursing, Ottawa, Canada; 2The Hospital for Sick Children, Child Health Evaluative Sciences, Toronto, Canada; 3The Hospital for Sick Children, Oncology/ Haematology, Toronto, Canada; 4The Hospital for Sick Children, Child Life, Toronto, Canada; 5University of Toronto / Hospital for Sick Children, Lawrence S. Bloomberg Faculty of Nursing University of Toronto / Child Health Evaluative Sciences, Toronto, Canada; 6The Hospital for Sick Children, Nursing, Toronto, Canada; 7McMaster University, Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine, Hamilton, Canada Background/Objectives: Subcutaneous port (SCP) accesses with needles are amongst the most painful and distressing treatmentrelated experiences for youths with cancer. In response, we developed a virtual reality (VR) intervention with hardware (i.e., headmounted display, handheld controller) and software (underwater program where head movements allow exploration) to distract youths during SCP accesses. This study aimed to refine this intervention such that it was acceptable to youths, did not cause adverse events, and safely allowed communication between youths and healthcare providers during VR immersion. Design/Methods: Two iterative cycles of usability testing were used. Eleven youths (11\u00b12.95 years; 27% female) with a variety of cancer diagnoses took part. Testing sessions were audiorecorded and 1 observer took field notes. Youths used the intervention during SCP accesses while \"thinking aloud\" about their impressions. Youths answered openended questions addressing the intervention and adverse events. The observer discussed the session and developed consensus on themes related to the study aims, referring to audiorecordings as necessary. Results: Youths liked both the VR hardware and software and reported it was easy to use. No adverse events occurred. Cycle 1 revealed that full engagement with the VR environment (i.e., head movements) was limited by requirements to remain still during the procedure. Cycle 2 revealed needs for: (1) more distracting intervention components (e.g., games and music) and (2) optional notifications related to the status of the procedure. Software changes to rectify these issues were made. Conclusions: Next steps will include feasibility testing before examining the intervention's effect on pain and distress during SCP access in a randomized controlled trial. We expect that an acceptable and safe VR intervention will decrease pain and distress and improve the quality of care delivered to young cancer patients. We would like to thank the patients who participated in the study. Funding was provided by the SickKids Garron Family Cancer Centre. PD-086 Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer Survivors - Information and Support Regarding Sexual Concerns M. Olsson 1, M. Jarfelt1 1Institute of Clinical Sciences University of Gothenburg, Pediatrics, G\u00f6teborg, Sweden Background/Objectives: In qualitative research, adolescent and young adult cancer patients express concerns on the lack of information on sexuality during treatment. The purpose of this study was to explore to what extent adolescent and young adult cancer survivors found information and support concerning sex. Design/Methods: A study specific questionnaire has been developed. The method used for question development includes expert validity from professionals and facetoface validity from former cancer patients. The questionnaire contains several areas in an adolescent and young adult's life affected by cancer and this study focused on information and support regarding sexual issues. The webbased questionnaire was sent to all adolescent and young adult cancer survivors treated during 2010 and 2011 in the North, Southeast and West Sweden. Results: Adolescent and young adult cancer survivors reported that health care professionals did not approach them on sexual issues during cancer treatment in 65% of the cases. Among adolescent and young adult cancer survivors 50 %, expressed not having any questions on sex during treatment. Of the adolescent and young adult cancer survivors who wanted information, 30 % were not satisfied with the information. They majority wanted information on sexual issues in person, from a physician or nurse and from written information, fewer wanted internet information and support. Almost half of the cancer survivors reported not having sex during treatment due to risk of infection. Conclusions: The result of this populationbased study encourage health care professionals caring for adolescent and young adult cancer patients to raise the question of sexual activity during treatment. To give an adolescent and young adult cancer patient general basic information on sexual issues along with individual recommendations may avoid misunderstandings regarding sexual activity during cancer treatment. PD-087 Initiating a Quality Improvement Project on SelfCare and Building Nurses' Resiliency on a Haematology/Oncology Unit C. Wilson 1, A. Li1, C. Emmanuele1, T. Hiller2, B. O'Neil1, A. for Sick Children, Toronto, 2The Hospital for Sick Children, Oncology/Haematology, Torono, Canada Background/Objectives: A group of nurses within a paediatric Haematology/Oncology unit has witnessed a steady increase in, what they believe, burnout and emotional exhaustion from staff. This phenomenon has been evidenced through verbal expressions of concern among peers, as well as an increased staff turnover. Oncology nurses support the physical and emotional journeys of their patients while laughing, crying and celebrating with them (Rishel, 2015) The ongoing stress of burnout is associated with nurse job dissatisfaction. (Potter et al., 2013). By being able to recognize signs and symptoms of burnout and compassion fatigue, as well as providing proper support to staff to incorporate wellness behaviours in their own life will help to increase job satisfaction and resiliency. Design/Methods: A Current State/Needs Assessment was done where nurses anonymously submitted \"stressors\" experienced on the identified unit. The next steps in this project are Focus Groups where five Focus Groups will be held with 68 Registered Nurses from the Haematology/Oncology Inpatient Unit per session. A separate Focus Group will be held with RNs who have recently left the unit. Discussions will be recorded/transcribed and analyzed. A survey will be completed which will be developed based on findings from Focus Groups. The survey will provide richer data on stressors and potential interventions that would be helpful in selfcare and building resiliency. Based on the findings of the survey, current research, and benchmarking with similar institutions, a unitbased program on selfcare and building resiliency will be developed and implemented and evaluated. Results: The Needs Assessment identified the stressors as: Lack of Breaks, The Number of New Initiatives and changes in Chemotherapy Protocols, Communication with the Interprofessional Team, Emotional Stress and Moral Distress leading to Burnout and The Increasing Workload Expectations. Conclusions: The conclusions that have been discovered this far are that there are stressors and that program development is needed. Treatment and Care Biology and Pathology PD-088 Cancer Predisposition in Childhood Cancer The Duesseldorf Experience in Comprehensive Clinical Evaluation and Trio Whole Exome Sequencing of Families T. Brozou 1, M. Kuhlen1, Fremerey1, Clinical Human Genetics, Dusseldorf, Germany; of Medical Informatics, Muenster, Germany Background/Objectives: A considerable percentage of childhood cancers are due to cancer predisposition syndromes (CPS). The ratio of CPSs caused by inherited versus de novo germline mutations is unknown and, thus, recurrence risk in siblings. In addition, the attitude of affected parents towards genetic testing of themselves is unclear. Design/Methods: We initiated an ongoing prospective study performing wholeexome sequencing (WES) of parentoffspring trios to identify CPS and inheritance patterns in newly diagnosed cancer children Results: Between 01/2015 and 12/2016, 81 (85.3%) of 95 families participated, 14 (14.7%) refused to participate. Of 81 children, 5 (6.2%) presented with congenital malignancies, 4 (4.9%) with tumors with a high likelihood of an underlying CPS. Of 68 family pedigrees, in 3 (4.4%) malignancies were revealed in family members <18 years, relatives with cancer <45 years in 6 (8.8%), any cancer history in 26 (38.2%), and >1 relative with cancer in 14 (20.6%). In 10 (14.7%) families, one first or seconddegree relative developed breast cancer, in 4 (5.9%) sarcoma and in 3 (4.4%) each lymphatic malignancies and colon cancer. To date, 57 trios were analyzed (depth 250700x, median coverage >95%). A bioinformatic pipeline was established, the actual gene list comprises about 2,000 genes and is ongoing updated. Based on data of the St. Judes study group (Zhang et al., NEJM 2015) variants are classified in three pathogenic categories. So far, 2 children with LFS and 1 child each with Dicer1 syndrome, CMMRD and APC associated polyposis were identified. Experimental analyses of various variants of unknown significance are in progress. Conclusions: Testing of an underlying CPS is of extraordinary interest to affected families. The vast majority opts for their right to know with particularly interest to recurrence risk in other offspring. Thus, trio sequencing should become common practice. PD-089 Identifying Children at Increased Risk for a Cancer Predisposition Syndrome: The McGill Interactive Pediatric Oncogenetic Guidelines Villani1, Malkin1, Sick Children, Pediatric Oncology, Toronto, Canada; 2Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Pediatric Oncology, Ottawa, Canada; 3McGill University, Human Genetics, Montreal, Canada; 4McGill University Health Center, Medical and Human Genetics, Montreal, Canada Background/Objectives: An estimated 1029% of children with cancer have an underlying cancer predisposition syndrome (CPS); many are unrecognized. Identifying cancer susceptibility and appropriately referring to a genetics team is vital to optimize patient care by incorporating potential preventative measures, adapting therapies, improving surveillance and counselling around family risk. Many challenges limit the likelihood of a physician identifying CPSs and technological advances in cancer genetics/genomics are rapidly outpacing the knowledge of most clinicians. To address these issues, we are developing the MIPOGG, an electronic and educational application for smart devices that include tumorspecific decisional algorithms designed to help identify those children with cancer at an increased risk of an underlying CPS. Design/Methods: For each pediatric cancer included in the International Classification of Childhood Cancers and the WHO classification of CNS tumors (2016 revision), an extensive literature review was undertaken to highlight clinical and/or molecular characteristics that increase the likelihood of a genetic predisposition. These characteristics were used to design simple algorithms following a binary tree structure with \"yes / no\" answers. Each algorithm ultimately advises one of two possible outcomes: 'Referral Suggested' or 'No Referral Necessary', linked with an educational module. All algorithms were critically reviewed by expert panels and validated through a multiinstitutional retrospective chart review to ensure sensitivity and positive predictive value. Results: Seventyfive tumorspecific algorithms will have been finalized and we will present examples including Osteosarcoma, Rhabdomyosarcoma and Wilms tumor, highlighting the performance of these algorithms in validation studies. We also outline the rationale for tumors requiring direct referral to a genetics service. Conclusions: The MIPOGG offers a clinically targeted approach, designed to easily identify patients at risk for a CPS, without the need for extensive or sophisticated investigations. As a clinical tool, it has potential to optimize management of children with cancer, across health care systems globally. Epidemiology Pathway of Care PD-090 Complementary and Alternative Medical Therapies in Pediatric Oncology Patients: A Single Center Experience in a LowMiddle Income Country A. Farrag 1, F. Ali2 1South Egypt Cancer Institute Assiut University, of Pediatric Oncology, Assiut, Egypt; 2Faculty of medicine Assiut University, Department of Pediatrics, Assiut, Egypt Background/Objectives: Many cultures have reported the usage of complementary and alternative medical therapies (CAMT) by cancer patients. Some patients waste time and money seeking advice for potentially harmful alternative medicine. Design/Methods: This study included pediatric oncology patients under all phases of therapy in South Egypt Cancer Institute. Personal interview with care givers (under consent) was done, focusing on their educational level, monthly income and residence. In addition to type, reason, experience and when they started CAMT, if used. Results: This study included 86 patients (54 males and 32 females), mean age was 7.7 (0.6619) years. Diagnoses included leukemia (44%) and other tumors (56%). Most patients were living in rural areas (83%), 29% of mothers were well educated. CAMT were reported by 52 patients (60.5%), causing delay in presentation (12 weeks) in 6 patients (11.5%). Its purpose was complimentary in 37 cases (71%) and alternative to medical therapy in 15 cases (29%). CAMT types were herbal (63%), nutritional (33%), magical (29%), religious (19%), or massage (15%). Multiple CAMT were used in 25 patients. Advisers to use CAMT were mostly the family (62%), other therapists (21%), or other patients (15%). Reasons to use CAMT were either to treat complications (62%), cancer (21%), initial undiagnosed disease (10%), or pain (21%), or to increase immunity after chemotherapy (15%), or relaxation (10%). Most patients reported that CAMT was effective (65%) and is the same as or better than conventional medical therapy (38%), they started its use mostly in early phases of diagnosis and treatment (73%). Most patients denied that any physician asked them about using CAMT (98%). CAMT usage was more in relatively richer families (n=31, p=0.023). There was no detected relationship between the use of CAMT and patient's sex, diagnosis, residence, or maternal educational level. Conclusions: Full medical history including CAMT is essential in all pediatric oncology patients. PD-091 Baseline Characteristics and Outcomes of Children with Cancer in the EnglishSpeaking Caribbean: A MultiNational Retrospective Cohort T. Gibson1, S. Beeput2, Gaspard3, C. George4, S. Weitzman10, V. Blanchette10, S. Gupta 10 1The University of the West Indies, Pathology, Kingston, Jamaica; 4Eric Williams Medical Complex, Oncology, Port of Spain, Trinidad & Tobago; 5Princess Margaret Hospital, Oncology, Nassau, Bahamas; 6Milton Cato Oncology, Kingstown, 7Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Bridgetown, Barbados; West Indies, Oncology, Kingston, Jamaica; 9The Hospital for Sick Children, Infectious Diseases, Toronto, Canada; 10The Hospital for Sick Children, Haematology/Oncology, Toronto, Canada Background/Objectives: Children with cancer in the Englishspeaking Caribbean (ESC) face unique challenges, including distribution across small populations at vast distances. ESC childhood cancer outcomes are unknown. Design/Methods: Through the SickKidsCaribbean Initiative (SCI), we established a multinational childhood cancer outcomes database across seven centres in six countries (Bahamas, Barbados, Jamaica, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, and Trinidad and Tobago). Trained data managers at each site actively entered patient demographics, disease, treatment, and outcome data. Data collection commenced in 2013, with retrospective collection to 2011 and subsequent prospective collection; data for 20112015 were analysed. Results: 367 children were diagnosed between 20112015; median age was 5.7 years (interquartile range 2.910.6 years). 124 (33.8%) patients were diagnosed with leukemia, 30 (8.2%) with lymphoma, and 149 (40.6%) with a solid tumour. A relative paucity of children with brain tumours was seen (N=48, 13.1%). Twoyear event free survival (EFS) for the entire cohort was 48.5%+/3.2%, while twoyear overall survival (OS) was 55.1%+/3.1%. Children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and Wilms tumour experienced better twoyear EFS (62.1%+/6.4% and 66.7%+/10.1%), while dismal outcomes were seen in children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML; 22.7+/9.6%), rhabdomyosarcoma (21.0%+/17.0%) and medulloblastoma (21.4%+/17.8%). Of 108 deaths with known cause, 58 (53.7%) were attributed to disease and 50 (46.3%) to treatment complications. Death within 60 days of diagnosis was relatively common in acute leukemia [13/98 (13.3%) ALL, 8/26 (30.8%) AML]. Despite this, traditional prognosticators adversely impacted outcome in ALL, including higher age, higher white blood cell count, and Tcell lineage. Conclusions: ESC childhood cancer outcomes are superior to those in many other low and middleincome settings but are still significantly inferior to highincome country outcomes. Based on these data, SCI interventions improving supportive care, diagnostics, and modifying leukemia treatment protocols are underway. Continued data collection will allow evaluation of these interventions and ensure maximal outcome improvements. PD-092 Childhood Cancer: Survival in Argentina. Report from the National Pediatric Cancer Registry, ROHA NET, 20002010 F. Moreno 1, C. Abriata3, ROHA Network1 Health, Ciudad Autonoma de Buenos Aire, Argentina Background/Objectives: Information on the epidemiology of childhood cancer is mandatory for the planning of healthcare policies. The Argentine National Pediatric Cancer Registry (ROHA) is a hospitalbased registry with national coverage and has been active since 2000. The aim of the current study was to analyze the 5year overall survival (OS) of children diagnosed with cancer in Argentina during 20002010 by major pediatric cancer subtypes. Design/Methods: Newly diagnosed pediatric cancer cases are registered in the ROHA (estimated coverage is 93% of the country\u00b4s cases). Fiveyear OS was estimated using KaplanMeier methods. Results: Between 2000 and 2010, a total of 14,239 new cancer diagnoses in children aged <15 years were reported to the registry. Fiveyear OS for all cancers was 57.4% (95%CI: 56.558.3). Specific 5year OS (95%CI: 38.246.1). Conclusions: The 5year OS for children diagnosed with cancer in Argentina was 57%. Even though this percentage is lower than what is reported in highincome countries the distribution of pediatric cancers by subtype were similar. Improving these results remains a challenge for our healthcare system. PD-093 Adolescent and Young Adult (AYA) Cancer Care in Canada: Highlights from A Report on System Performance Metrics P. Rogers 1, C. Rae2, K. Marr1, S. Gupta3, D. Szwajcer4, of Ontario, Oncology, Toronto, Canada; 7BC Cancer Agency, Cancer Control 12University of Alberta, Business, Edmonton, Canada; 13University of Alberta, Pediatrics, Edmonton, Canada Background/Objectives: Health care needs for AYAs with cancer are different from those in older and younger patients. Reporting of indicators is essential to evaluate projects and system changes being undertaken to improve care for this population. The goal of this project was to report on indicators to assess the current state of AYA cancer care in Canada. Design/Methods: Measures of health system performance were selected from consensusbased indicators. Data were obtained from administrative databases and national surveys. Areas of focus included: epidemiology, active care, palliation, psychosocial issues, survivorship and research. Results: Epidemiology: Over the last 20 years there has been an 18.2% relative increase in new cancer cases in 1529 year olds. Fiveyear relative survival was 86.3%, an absolute increase of 6.2% from the early 1990s. Active care: Among 20-29 year olds, 26.6% began treatment 57 days after diagnosis for breast cancer; approximately 20% of other age groups waited a similar period. 54% of AYAs with breast and colon cancer were treated at teaching hospitals as compared to 47.8% of older adults. Palliation: Most AYA cancer deaths in 2012 occurred in hospital (73%). Psychosocial issues: Emotional support was rated negatively by both AYA males (24.1%) and females (26.2%). Survivorship: Cancer survivors and the general population shared similar achievement rates of postsecondary education; cancer survivors reported higher unemployment. Research: Average annual investment in AYAspecific cancer research between 2005 and 2013 was $1.8 million, 0.4% of total cancer research investments in Canada. As of June 2016, 128 of therapeutic cancer clinical trials (32.9%) were for a cancer prevalent among AYAs. Conclusions: Opportunities for improving care for AYAs with cancer were identified, as was a gap in research investment. Challenges to reporting on AYA indicators were identified e.g. lack of agespecific data; inability to analyze by type of cancer and age. The report is available through systemperformance.ca. PD-094 Hispanic Ethnicity is Associated with MethotrexateRelated Neurotoxicity in Children Receiving Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment O. Taylor 1, A. Brown1, J. Brackett1, I. Moore2, C. M. of Medicine, Pediatrics HematologyOncology Section, Houston, USA; 2University of Arizona, School of Nursing, Tucson, USA; 3University of Minnesota, School of Nursing, Minneapolis, USA; 4Duke University, School of Nursing, Durham, USA Background/Objectives: Methotrexate is a critically important chemotherapeutic in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) therapy. However, MTXinduced neurotoxicity (NT) can lead to treatment modifications, which may jeopardize longterm survival in affected patients. The objective of this study is to evaluate demographic and clinical factors associated with incidence of acute MTX NT among pediatric patients with ALL. Design/Methods: Pediatric ALL patients (n=216) undergoing therapy at three major childhood cancer treatment centers in the United States (Texas Children's Cancer Center; University of Arizona; Children's Minnesota) between 2012 and 2017 were enrolled on a prospective study of treatmentrelated toxicity. MTX NT was defined as any neurologic event (e.g., aphasia, seizure) following intrathecal (IT) and/or intravenous (IV) MTX that resulted in modifications in IT and/or IV MTX therapy. Logistic regression was used to generate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the impact of demographic and treatment features on MTX NT. Results: Thirtyfour patients (16%) experienced acute MTX NT. Of the patients who experienced NT, 77% (n=26) were Hispanic compared to 41% (n=75) of those without MTX NT (n=182). Median age at diagnosis was significantly higher (p<0.001) in MTX NT group: 12.4 years vs. 6.3 years, respectively. Hispanics were 4 times (OR=4.60, 95% CI: 1.7611.98, p=0.002) more likely to experience MTX NT than nonHispanics after adjusting for sex, age at diagnosis, and ALL risk stratification. Independent of Hispanic ethnicity, only ALL risk stratification remained a statistically significant predictor of MTX NT. Conclusions: In this large multiethnic cohort, we found that Hispanic ethnicity was strongly associated with increased risk of MTX NT. This adds to the growing body of evidence indicating that Hispanic patients with ALL encounter significant disparities in treatment outcomes. Understanding the mechanisms and predictors of these disparities is critical to improving the outcomes and survival for these patients. Late Effects PD-095 LongTerm Cardioprotective Efficacy of Dexrazoxane and Liposomal Doxorubicin Evaluated a Murine Model of Doxorubicin Treatment T. Andrews1, G. Aune 1 1Greehey Children's Cancer Research Institute/University of Texas Health Science, Pediatrics Division of HematologyOncology, San Antonio, USA Background/Objectives: Exposure to anthracyclines such as doxorubicin (DOX) during childhood cancer treatment is unequivocally linked to the development of cardiovascular disease. Clinical strategies to mitigate longterm cardiac morbidity in childhood cancer survivors include pretreatment with the iron chelator dexrazoxane (DEX) and the use of liposomal doxorubicin (LDOX). Both strategies decrease acute cardiac toxicity. However, due to the long latent period between exposure and development of cardiac disease, the longterm cardiac outcome of survivors treated using these strategies is mostly unknown. Thus, their use has not yet been widely adopted in clinical practice. Here we report the evaluation of DEX and LDOX in a clinically relevant murine model of early anthracycline exposure followed by the monitoring of cardiac function and survival throughout lifespan into aged adult mice. Design/Methods: Beginning at 2 weeks of age, C57BL6/J mice (n = 6 per group, equal numbers of males and females) were treated with weekly intraperitoneal injections as follows: saline control, 5 mg/kg DEX:5 mg/kg DOX, and 5 mg/kg LDOX. Following completion of therapy, mice were monitored under normal laboratory conditions. Physical parameters including body weight, survival, and cardiac function using standard echocardiography were evaluated every three months up to 22 months of age (aged adult mouse). Results: Compared to controls, mice treated with DOX exhibited significantly reduced body weight (26% decrease), survival (50% decrease), and cardiac function (12% decrease in ejection fraction E.F.) In contrast, mice treated with DEX + DOX or LDOX exhibited normal body weight (no decrease), enhanced survival (100%), and normal cardiac function (normal E.F.) compared to DOXtreated animals. Conclusions: These studies performed in mice indicate that both dexrazoxane and LDOX significantly mitigate cardiac damage induced by early anthracycline exposure, throughout the lifespan and into old age. Clinical practice should incorporate widespread use of these cardioprotective strategies. PD-096 Neurocognitive Change Following Treatment for Pediatric Brain Tumors with Proton Beam Radiotherapy Versus Surgery Only L. Kahalley 1, C. 1Baylor of USA; 2Mayo Clinic, Radiation Oncology, Rochester, USA; 3Baylor College of Medicine, Neurosurgery, Houston, USA; 4The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Radiation Oncology, Houston, USA; 5Baylor College of Medicine, Dan L. Duncan Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, Houston, USA Background/Objectives: Cranial radiotherapy is associated with neurocognitive toxicity. Proton beam radiotherapy (PBRT) reduces the volume of normal tissue receiving radiation dose, which may lead to better neurocognitive outcomes. We examined change in neurocognitive scores over time in pediatric brain tumor patients treated with craniospinal PBRT (PCSI), focal PBRT (PFocal), and Surgery Only (SO). Design/Methods: Patients received annual neurocognitive evaluations for up to 5 years. We examined Full Scale IQ (FSIQ), Working Memory Index (WMI), and Processing Speed Index (PSI) scores. Separate general linear mixed models examined change in scores over time by treatment group. Results: Scores were available for 69 patients (16 PCSI, 21 PFocal, 32 SO). Groups did not differ on demographic or clinical variables (47.8% male, 37.7% infratentorial tumor, mean ageattreatment=9.8 dose was PCSI and 50.4 Gy for PFocal. FSIQ, WMI, and PSI scores remained stable over time in all treatment groups (allp>0.05). Means for all three groups were within normal limits across scores and available time points. Even though FSIQ did not decline significantly in any group, the FSIQ slope of the PCSI group differed significantly from the slopes of the PFocal and SO groups (both p=0.03). Conclusions: Within early survivorship, PBRT was not associated with significant cognitive decline. Outcomes were similar whether patients received PBRT (CSI or focal) or no radiotherapy. Not only was global IQ within normal limits for age, but processing speed and working memory (domains known to be particularly radiosensitive) were also consistent with ageexpectations across groups. CSI emerged as a cognitive risk factor, consistent with photon outcomes research. While findings are hopeful, replication with a larger sample and later outcomes is needed and underway. PD-097 Risk Factors for Preterm Delivery Among Early Onset Cancer Survivors - A RegisterBased Study J. Melin1, S. Hein\u00e4vaara1, N. Malila1, A. Tiitinen2, M. Gissler3, L. MadanatHarjuoja 1 1Finnish Cancer Registry, Institute for Statistical and Epidemiological Cancer Research, Helsinki, Finland; 2University of Helsinki Helsinki University Hospital, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Helsinki, Finland; 3National Institute for Health and Welfare, National Institute for Health and Welfare, Helsinki, Finland Background/Objectives: Previous studies have shown an elevated risk for preterm delivery among female cancer survivors. Our aim was to assess pregnancy related conditions possibly underlying the elevated risk for preterm labor in cancer survivors. Design/Methods: Nationwide cancer and birth registries were merged to identify 1,831 first deliveries of cancer survivors (diagnosed below 40 years of age) and 5,281 first deliveries of matched female controls between January 1991 and December 2013. Multiple unconditional logistic regression models were used to estimate the risk for pregnancy related conditions adjusting for maternal age, year of delivery, gestational age and smoking. Results: We found a significantly elevated risk for hospitalization due to threatened preterm labor (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.031.95), fear of childbirth (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.303.05) and mental disorders and diseases of the nervous system (OR 3.99, 95% CI 2.137.48) among survivors compared to controls. An increased risk for overall hospitalization (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.281.68) and hospital stays exceeding 7 days (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.041.46) was also found. The risk for premature rupture of the membrane, vaginal bleeding, preeclampsia or gestational diabetes was not increased. The highest risk for hospitalization due to threatened preterm labor was seen among survivors delivering 05 years after cancer treatment and survivors diagnosed as young adults (age 2539 years). Conclusions: Cancer survivors have an increased risk for preterm delivery possibly explained by spontaneous preterm labor due to premature contractions and cervical shortening. Health professionals treating these women should be aware of these risks. In general, however, our results are reassuring when it comes to pregnancies among cancer survivors. PD-098 An Exploratory Analysis of Physical Activity on Modifiable AgingRelated Risk Factors Among Survivors of Childhood Cancer N. Sloof1, E. Hendershot2, M. Griffin3, University, Health Aging & Society, Hamilton, Canada; 4McMaster University, Pediatrics, Hamilton, Canada Background/Objectives: By age 45, more than 80% of survivors of cancer in childhood (SCC) have serious chronic health conditions. The literature remains unclear whether lifestyle factors, including physical activity (PA), are related to longterm health outcomes. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between PA and established late effects of treatment in adult survivors of childhood cancer. Design/Methods: A retrospective chart review including all adult SCC currently enrolled in the McMaster Aftercare program was performed. Information on diagnosis, treatment, PA and other lifestyle behaviours, as well as physiologic measures was abstracted. Predictors of established late effects of cancer therapy were examined using logistic regression on multivariable models built with known risk factors determined a priori, and significant predictors from univariate analyses. Results: Of the 262 patients included, only 42% reported behaviour that met PA recommendations, and 27% indicated no PA participation. In multivariable analysis, significant independent associations were shown between normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and adequate PA (P=0.03), as well as female sex (P=0.04), while accounting for doxorubicin (P=0.21), chest radiation (P=0.08), as well as other factors. Low bone mineral density (BMD) was associated with no PA (P=0.03) and ideal body mass index (BMI) (P=0.02). Body fat percentage was associated with cranial radiation (P<0.01) and female sex (P<0.01). High BMI was associated with no PA (P=0.01) and normal BMD (P<0.01). BMI was the only modifiable risk factor associated with any lipid levels in univariate analysis. Conclusions: Despite ongoing healthy active living counselling, only 42% of SCC in our clinic meet PA guidelines. We identified novel independent associations between PA and LVEF, BMD, and BMI in SCC, shown to be more strongly associated with these markers of health than many established predictive treatment and lifestylerelated factors. PA is an important predictor of healthy aging among SCC. PD-099 Neurological Outcomes in Pediatric Low Grade Glioma by Tumor Site and Timing of Diagnosis Z. Sadighi 1, E. Curtis1, J. Zabrowski2, C. Billups3, R. Khan1, Qaddoumi4 Children's Research Hospital, Oncology, Memphis, USA Background/Objectives: Characterization of neurological outcomes by site of tumor and duration of presenting symptoms in patients with pediatric low grade glioma (LGG) has not been assessed until now. Design/Methods: An institutional review boardapproved retrospective study was conducted for patients diagnosed with LGG at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital between 1995 and 2005. Neurological impairments (severity defined by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03) were compared at first and last visit by tumor location and prediagnosis symptom interval (PSI) ( 3months or < 3 months) using KruskalWallis test, Wilcoxon rank sum test, and Fisher's exact test. Results: 246 patients with LGG (106 spinal cord, posterior fossa (PF), and brainstem; 88 optic pathway and midline; and 52 cerebral hemisphere) were included; median age of diagnosis 7.1 (range, 0.1 - 20.7) years, median PSI 2.1 (<1-131.1) months, and median time to last followup 11.6 (0.121.4) years. Cerebral hemisphere had fewest median neurological impairments (2) compared to other locations (4) at baseline (p<0.001); and at last followup (3) compared to other locations (5) (p=0.004). In all patients, PSI 3 months had higher incidence of ataxia and dysmetria (41.6%) (p=0.003). PSI 3 months had overall worse motor weakness in cerebral hemisphere; dysmetria in optic pathway and midline; and dysmetria and ear and vestibular disturbances in spinal cord, PF, and brainstem (p0.05). PSI < 3 months) in spinal cord, PF, and brainstem had worsening vagal nerve deficit (p=0.026). Conclusions: Neurological outcomes in pediatric LGG vary by location and delayed diagnosis minimally affects neurological outcomes. IPSO Poster Discussion PD-100 Bronchial Blockers in Pediatric Thoracic Surgical Moscow, Institute Oncological Oncology department, Moscow, Russia Background/Objectives: In pediatric oncology lungs are the most frequent target of metastasis, so diagnostic and therapeutic surgeries are required. To guarantee optimal conditions for surgery, collapse of operated lung is required, thus one lung ventilation (OLV) should be performed. Novel devices for OLV, such as Cohen, EZBlocker and Arndt bronchial to other complications. Design/Methods: During September'14 March'17, 57 surgeries in patients 1017 years old were performed. OLV was maintained using BB. BB was introduced through the lumen of video endotracheal tube and was placed into bronchus under video control. Installation of Arndt BB was conducted under endoscopic control. In 24 cases (43%) right main bronchus, in 33 cases (57%) left main bronchus were blocked. Time of BB installation, lung collapse score after installation of thoracoscopic ports, hemodynamic profile during surgery, frequency of postoperative complications such as sore throat and aphonia were evaluated. Results: Mean time of intubation and BB installation was 187 +/ 42 seconds. In all cases it was possible to achieve satisfactory lung collapse, but in 16 cases aspiration of air through the channel of BB had to be performed. Collapsing the right lung presents some difficulties due to the anatomical features as higher embranchement of right upper lobe bronchus. In this case use of EZBlocker BB is preferable as it is designed to be securely fixed over carina, making it less likely to displace during surgery. In surgeries on the left lung Cohen BB is more preferable. Conclusions: The use of BB requires expensive hightech equipment for video or endoscopic control, and well trained staff with skills of BB installation and maintaining OLV. BB is a promising technique to achieve the effective collapse of the lung with minimal traumatisation, fewer complications postoperatively and rapid rehabilitation of patients after surgery. PD-101 Curcumin in Rhabdomyosarcoma: Influences on Photodynamic and Cytotoxic Effects in Vitro C. Sorg 1, E. Schmid1, J. Fuchs1, V. Ellerkamp1 1University Pediatric Urology, T\u00fcbingen, Germany Background/Objectives: Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common soft tissue tumor in children. The outcome for children with advanced tumor disease is still poor. Curcumin, a naturally occuring phenol, is investigated in complementary oncology research for its ZF) and cell were treated with curcumin 0,51g/ml; light with 488nm for 5sec.). The human skeletal muscle cell line SKMC served as control. Cell viability was assessed with MTT assays. The apoptosis rate was evaluated via FACS analysis. Migration was investigated with a wound healing assay. Clonogenic survival of RMS cells was detected by Colony forming assay. Results: Combination of curcumin and vincristine led to dosedepending effects on all cell lines: that appears in a decrease in cell proliferation and migration potential as well as an increase in apoptosis rate. The combination therapy with photodynamic therapy resulted in a highly significant decrease of cell viability in RMS cell lines even with very low concentrations of curcumin (1g/ml). The results also show that curcumin inhibits the cloning efficiency of RMS cells. Conclusions: In summary, this study provides first evidence that curcumin, especially in combination with standard chemotherapy or photodynamic therapy is a promising agent in the treatment of RMS. Further in vivo studies are pending. PD-102 The Risk of Adrenal Insufficiency in Neuroblastoma Surgery C.H. Chui 1 1Surgery Centre for Children Pte Ltd, Surgical Oncology, Singapore, Singapore Background/Objectives: More than 40% of neuroblastoma arise from the adrenal gland. Adrenalectomy has been the treatment of choice. However, the contralateral adrenal gland is often also at risk leading to the development of postoperative adrenal insufficiency (AI). We reviewed the risk of AI in our patients who underwent neuroblastoma surgery. Design/Methods: Retrospective analysis of 165 patients with neuroblastoma in the \"suprarenal region\", defined as retroperitoneal zone superior to the renal veins and arteries. AI was defined as chronic or transient. Patients were categorized based on locoregional disease distribution: (A) right adrenal disease only, (B) left adrenal disease only, (C) right adrenal and left periadrenal disease, (D) left adrenal and right periadrenal disease, (E) bilateral adrenal disease, and (F) nonadrenal paravertebral disease. Demographic data, surgical records and postoperative charts were reviewed. Results: 18(10.9%) out of 165 patient developed AI, of which 3 were chronic and 15 were transient. None of unilateral adrenaldiseased patients in Groups A(n=21) and B(n=28) developed AI. Half(50%) of 8 bilateral adrenaldiseased patients in Group E developed AI. 2(7.4%) of 27 patients in Group F developed AI. When unilateral adrenal disease was coupled with contralateral periadrenal disease, 9(33.3%) of 27 patients in Group C compared to 3(5.6%) of 54 patients in Group D developed AI (p=0.0009) suggesting that the left adrenal gland was more vulnerable to surgical damage. The right adrenal gland was more likely to be preserved due to the shorter course of right adrenal vein. Conclusions: Preserving adrenal function should be considered in neuroblastoma surgery. Due caution should be rendered to left adrenal gland after right adrenalectomy because of its vulnerable vasculature. Early hydrocortisone replacement should be instituted when AI is suspected. PD-103 Radiotherapy Omitted in the Treatment of Positive Surgical Margins after NephronSparing Surgery for Wilms Tumor D. Cozzi 1, S. frediani1, I. Falconi1, A. Boscarelli1, F. Cozzi1 1Sapienza University of Rome, Pediatric Surgery Unit, Rome, Italy Background/Objectives: Current treatment of microscopic residual disease with negative lymph nodes after nephronsparing surgery (NSS) for Wilms tumor includes radiotherapy and multidrugs chemotherapy. The aim of present study is to test the hypothesis that some children with positive margins after NSS may be successfully treated without radiotherapy. Design/Methods: Between 1992 and 2016, 50 children with renal tumor underwent surgery at our institution. Eight patients with unilateral Wilms tumor and 1 with unilateral renal oncocytoma underwent partial nephrectomy. In addition, 6 children with unilateral Wilms tumor and 1 with bilateral Wilms tumor underwent one or multiple enucleation. Two children after partial nephrectomy and 2 after enucleation presented positive surgical margins without lymph nodes involvement and were treated with chemotherapy without radiotherapy. Results: The child with bilateral Wilms tumor underwent secondlook operation consisting in new enucleations followed by postoperative chemotherapy without radiotherapy. This patient is alive and well at the age of 7 years. The other 3 children with positive margins treated without radiotherapy are alive and well at the age of 24,23, and 6 years. All patients had an eGFR within the range of twokidney renal function, no hypertension and albuminuria. Conclusions: Some children with positive surgical margins after NSS for Wilms tumor may be successfully treated without radiotherapy. Larger numbers of patients are needed to determine whether this approach is generally applicable. PD-104 Lack of Renal Artery Inspection is Associated with Low Resectability at the Renal Hilus in Relapsed HighRisk Neuroblastoma 1, T. Simon2, Hospital Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Background/Objectives: The renal hilus is the main lymphatic drainage route of the adrenal medulla. Inspection and preparation of the renal artery during debulking of tumor tissue at the renal hilus constitutes a surgical challenge in highrisk neuroblastoma. However, the association of renal artery exposure with resectability of high risk neuroblastoma during first line resecting abdominal surgery (S1) at the renal hilus is not clearly defined. Design/Methods: Fourty patients with relapse or progression of highrisk neuroblastoma (RHRNB) after first line surgery enrolled in the German neuroblastoma trials between 20002010 were evaluated. We analyzed the frequency of renal artery exposure and the resectability at the renal hilus by means of surgical reports for S1. Results: The tumor involved the renal vessels in 28/40 (70%) of patients on the right (R) and left (L) side. Inspection of the artery during operation was documented on the right side in 9/28 (32%), and on the left side in 6/28 (21%) patients. Exposure of the renal artery was associated with a higher resection rate at the renal hilus as compared to cases analysis of RHRNB revealed a high frequency of tumors at the renal hilus but a low rate of renal artery inspection. Renal artery inspection was associated with a higher resection rate of tumors at the renal hilus. The results of our study emphasize the importance of renal artery inspection as instrument of surgical quality during first resection of abdominal high risk neuroblastoma at the renal hilus. Vice versa inspection of the renal arteries might also be an indication of an operation technique more likely to achieve complete tumor resection. PD-105 The Role of Radiology Versus Clinical Follow Up for Identification of Solid Tumour Relapse M. Collin 1, Children's Cancer Research Unit, Sydney, Australia Background/Objectives: The clinical and radiological follow up of paediatric solid tumour patients aims to include early identification of relapse. Standardised three monthly (or more frequent) imaging is often employed, however surveillance imaging has not been well studied. The risks of the high cumulative doses of radiation in these protocols include the potential for secondary malignancies. Our study aims to identify the role imaging plays in establishing relapse in the solid tumour population. Design/Methods: This study involves a retrospective audit of patients who were managed at our hospital in a sixteenyear period (20002015) who presented with the oncology and radiology databases, as well as medical records. Results: We identified 528 patients from the oncology databases, of which 131 failed to meet inclusion criteria of achieving radiological remission or had incomplete records throughout the follow up period and were excluded. This left 397 included patients of which 72 patients had relapse. In those cases with relapse 35 were identified clinically, PET, 1 with combined CT/MRI) and 19 cases with other imaging forms (5 with PET alone, 3 with bone scan, 3 with MIBG alone, 2 with CXR, 3 with MRI alone and 3 with ultrasound). There were 4 cases of secondary malignancies identified in the follow up period. The total number of CT scans performed in the follow up period was 1,953, resulting in a mean number of CT studies per patient of 4.9 and equating to one episode of CT identified relapse per 108.5 CT scans. Conclusions: We conclude that while radiological investigations play a role alongside clinical history and examination in establishing relapse, further studies are required to minimise the radiation exposure in these protocols, while maximising the clinical benefit. PD-106 The Violations of The Surgical Guidelines for Wilms Tumour J. HOSPITALS NHS TRUST, Paediatric Surgery, Leeds, United Kingdom; 8University of Munich, Department of Pediatric Surgery, Munich, Germany; 9Princess Maxima, Paediatric Surgery, Utrecht, The Netherlands; 10NKI, NKI, Amsterdam, The Netherlands 11Saarland University, Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Homburg, Germany Background/Objectives: Surgery plays important role in the treatment of nephroblastoma. The major multicentre studies precisely recommend the guidelines for the surgical treatment. Aim of the study was to evaluate the rates and types of potentially most important violations and iatrogenic failures of the SIOP2001 surgical guidelines. Design/Methods: The retrospective review of 2429 records of patients aged > 6 months with unilateral nephroblastoma registered in the SIOP2001. The candidate violations/iatrogenic failures were (1) preoperative open biopsy, (2) intraoperative tumour rupture and (3) sampling less than 6 regional lymph nodes. Factors 1 and 2 result in staging patient 3, longer chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Factor 3 (not representative sampling) may lead to incorrect lower staging and, in consequence, insufficient aggressiveness and duration of the postoperative treatment. Results: The preoperative open biopsies were performed in 7% of all patients and were the main reason for staging III in 24% of stage III patients. The intra operative tumour ruptures were reported in 1.45% of patients. Not adequate sampling (less than 6 lymph nodes) of the regional lymph nodes was reported in 88.2 % of patients. In 13.8% lymph nodes were not sampled at all. This factor was the only reason for staging 3 in 15% of cases, however the underestimation of the rate of lymph nodes involvement seems probable. Conclusions: Surgical guidelines are correctly followed in majority of patients, main problem considers incorrect sampling of the lymph nodes what results in possible downstaging of patients, less aggressive postoperative treatment and higher risk of relapse. The iatrogenic upstaging the patients due to pretreatment open biopsy and the intraoperative tumour rupture were less frequent, however majority of such events were possible to avoid. PD-107 FollowUp of Benign Ovarian Tumours: Should We Change UK Practice? S. Arul 1, Jester1 1Birmignham Children's Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Dept. of Surgery, Birmingham, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: Established UK practice, following complete resection of unilateral benign ovarian tumour, was that the risk of developing a metachronous tumour in the contralateral ovary was very low and therefore, did not require follow up. However this was challenged by a 2014 paper which showed a 23% rate of metachronous tumours in the contralateral ovary.1 We wished to establish exactly what our follow up arrangements were and whether there had been any cases of metachronous tumours in our group of patients which could help to shape future UK guidelines. Design/Methods: A retrospective study of girls with ovarian teratomas presenting to us between 2006 and 2016 were identified from the histology database. Clinical data on age of diagnosis, biochemical tumour markers, histology, followup appointments and radiology were collected from hospital records and analysed. Results: 41 girls underwent surgery for an ovarian teratoma between 2006 and 2016 (median age 11.9 years (range 4.5 16.1 yr)). Patients all presented with abdominal pain or asymptomatic lower abdominal swelling. Four had raised tumour markers. Histology revealed 34 mature teratomas, 4 immature teratomas and two were unclassified. Eleven patients had evidence of torsion. Radiological follow up with ultrasound occurred in 19 patients (median 6 months, range 1 month to 5 years). In this time there was not a single case of radiological recurrence. In addition there were no cases in the remaining 22 patients that presented with clinical signs of a ovarian tumour. Conclusions: In our series there was not a single case of a metachronous ovarian tumour to suggest a need for a change in our practice. However, a prospective study of UK patients would be required to definitively establish the rate of recurrence. 1Metachronous benign ovarian tumors are not uncommon in children Taskinen a, et al, 2014, Journal Paediatric Surgery:49;43545 PD-108 Surgical Challenges and Lessons Learnt in Paediatric Cervicofacial Teratomas K. Khanna D. Bagga3, M. Bajpai4 1All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Pediatric Surgery, New Delhi, India; 2Lady Hardinge Medical College & Associated Kalawati Saran Paediatric Surgery, New Delhi, India; 3Safdarjung Hospital, Paediatric Surgery, Delhi, India; 4All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Paediatric Surgery, New Delhi, India Background/Objectives: The incidence of mature congenital teratomas at all sites is 1 in 4000 live births. Of these, <2% are cervicofacial. We highlight the challenges involved in the perioperative and intraoperative management of large cervicofacial teratomas in infants. Design/Methods: Four infants operated for large cervicofacial teratomas between June 2015 till February 2017 were included. Results: Four infants, age ranging from 12 days to 88 days, presented with huge cervicofacial teratomas. The average tumor size ranged from 7\u00d78\u00d74cm to 22\u00d718\u00d712cm. Two neonates presented with epignathus teratomas with cleft palate and intranasal extension but no intra cranial extension on CT scan. The other two presented with giant cervicofacial teratomas with compression and flattening of underlying skull bone but no intracranial extension. Preoperative FP levels were normal for age in all. Two required 15 days of nasogastric (NG) feeds preoperatively. Intubation was a challenge to the and was aided by fiberoptic bronchoscopy and nasotracheal intubation in 2 cases. Average blood loss was 53.5ml and the mean operating time was 92 \u00b1 11minutes. All underwent complete excision and histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of mature teratoma in all. Conclusions: Large congenital cervicofacial teratomas in infants are usually benign but they may pose a surgical emergency if airway is compromised. Detailed imaging is required to delineate the extent of lesion and plan surgery. Good preoperative nutritional status guides the timing of surgery. Nasotracheal intubation/ flexometallic endotracheal tubes may be required. Large tumor size, distortion of the normal anatomy and increased vascularity pose a surgical risk. Harmonic scalpel aids excision. Early institution of postoperative NG feeds and physiotherapy helped in speedy recovery, return of function and normalization of appearance. PD-109 Ablation Techniques as Adjuvant Therapy for Pediatric Malignancies J. Daley 1, R. Bhuta2, D. Tessier3, A. Chawla2, B. DeNardo2 1Rhode Island Hospital, Department of Pediatrics, Providence, USA; 2Rhode Island Hospital, Division of Pediatric HematologyOncology, Providence, USA; 3Rhode Island Hospital, Department of Radiology, Providence, USA Background/Objectives: Imageguided ablation techniques, including thermal and chemical ablation, are commonly used therapeutic options for the treatment of malignant lesions in adults. Ablation may be used with curative intent incorporated into a multimodal treatment regimen or as palliative treatment for painful lesions. Although well established in adult malignancies, there is little data regarding the use of such techniques in pediatric oncology patients. This study retrospectively analyzes the use of imageguided ablation as adjuvant therapy for a pediatric oncology population at our institution. Design/Methods: A retrospective chart review identified 11 pediatric patients with 21 malignant lesions treated with 36 ablations. Clinical information and treatment details regarding each ablation procedure were collected with institutional review board approval. Results: The 11 patients treated with ablation at our institution were 222 years of age. Five of the patients were diagnosed with osteosarcoma; the 6 additional patients each had a solid tumor of varying histology. The majority of patients had diffusely metastatic or relapsed disease. Of 17 ablation sessions, 13 were performed for palliative purposes, while 4 were performed with curative intent. Microwave, radiofrequency and cryoablation were used to ablate lesions ranging in size from 17 cm. Common sites of ablation included the lung, liver, and soft tissues. All 36 ablations were reported with technical success with limited complications including 1 pneumothorax. All symptomatic patients achieved pain relief. Local progression occurred in 10% of previously treated lesions and 10 of 11 patients have died of disease. Conclusions: Ablation can be performed safely and effectively in children with limited toxicity. Ablation may provide effective local disease control in addition to palliation for appropriately selected pediatric patients and tumor sites. Differential considerations must be acknowledged between adults and children. Ablation represents a minimally invasive treatment approach that should be considered in the treatment course of children with metastatic solid tumors. PD-110 Posterior Retroperitoneoscopic Surgery, Singapore, Singapore; 2KK Women's and Children's Hospital, Department of Diagnostic & Interventional Imaging, Singapore, Singapore; 3KK Women's and Children's Hospital, Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Singapore, Singapore; 4KK Women's and Children's Hospital, Operating Theatre, Singapore, Singapore Background/Objectives: Posterior retroperitoneoscoic adrenalectomy has been reported as an option for adrenal tumor resection, but is not commonly performed in children due to the extreme semikneeling position advocated to flatten the lumbar lordosis in order to achieve adequate retroperitoneal space. As children have smaller lordosis angles, flattening of the lordosis and creation of optimal retroperitoneal space may be achieved with less hip flexion. We used pediatric lumbar lordosis measurements to develop a modified prone jackknife position, and report our experiences with this setup for posterior retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy for adrenal sagittal computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of pediatric patients with adrenal tumors and compared to normal references. The data was used to develop our modified prone jackknife position. Selected patients with adrenal tumors underwent posterior retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy in this position. Patient demographics, diagnoses, operative time, complications, postop analgesia requirements, and length of hospitalization were analyzed. Results: CT and MRI studies were analyzed for 20 patients with adrenal tumors diagnosed in our institution from 20122017; median lordosis angle was 25.85\u00b0(range: 24.32\u00b037.41\u00b0). Four patients underwent retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy between June operating time was 150.5 minutes [range: 111-181 minutes]. No conversions to open surgery were required. One patient had intraoperative bleeding from the adrenal vein. Only 1 patient required postoperative opioids for analgesia. Median length of hospitalization after surgery was 2 days (range: 23 days). Conclusions: Pediatric patients can achieve flattening of lumbar lordosis with less extreme positioning. Posterior retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy in a modified prone jackknife position is a feasible operation for pediatric patients with small adrenal tumors, with advantages of short operative time, minimal requirements for opioid analgesia and short lengths of hospitalization. PD-111 Incidence, Treatment, and Outcomes of NonWilms Renal Tumors in Children: A Single Institution Experience S. Qureshi 1, S. Kembhavi2, M. Ramadwar3, G. Prasad4, 2Tata Memorial Hospital, Radiology, Mumbai, India; 3Tata Hospital, India; 4Tata Memorial Hospital, Medical Oncology, Mumbai, India; 5Tata Radiation Oncology, Mumbai, India Background/Objectives: Although Wilms tumour is the most common paediatric renal tumour, the nonWilms renal tumour encountered occasionally may pose a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. The aim of this study is to determine the incidence and analyze the treatment and overall outcome of nonWilms tumours in children. Design/Methods: Materials and methods: Of the 264 patients with primary renal tumours treated between January 2004 to December 2016, 229 (87%) with Wilms and 35(13%) patients with nonWilms tumour were identified from the prospectively maintained database. Patients presenting with recurrent disease were excluded from treatment and outcome analysis. Results: The nonWilms tumour included renal upfront (n= 22) or after preoperative chemotherapy (n= 8). Adjuvant therapy was offered based on the histology to 16 patients. Disease relapse was seen in nine patients, of whom eight have died of disease, including all the three patients with malignant rhabdoid tumour. The median survival range from seven months to 11 years and the projected 5 years overall and eventfree survival for all patients is 65.2% and 63% respectively. Conclusions: NonWilms tumour constitutes less than 15% of all renal tumours. The treatment depends on the specific histology and the survival range from a few months to several years. Accurate diagnosis is essential to select and decide the intensity of the treatment. PD-112 Multidisciplinary Approach to Malignant Solid Tumors in Neonates and Infants Younger Than 1 Year T. Sharoev 1, N. Ivanova1, J. Nesterova1, O. Polushkina1, A. Kotlovsky3, A. Prityko4 1St Luka's Clinical Research Centre for Children Moscow Russia, Oncology, Moscow, Russia; 2St Luka's Clinical Research Centre for Children Moscow Russia, Neonatology, Moscow, Russia; 3St Luka's Clinical Research Centre for Children Moscow Russia, Pediatric Surgery, Moscow, Russia; 4St Luka's Clinical Research Centre for Children Moscow Russia, Administration, Moscow, Russia Background/Objectives: Despite advances in pediatric oncology, the management of neonates and infants younger than 1 year with malignant solid tumors poses a challenge. Aiming to achieve the optimal outcome for these patients we apply the multidisciplinary approach to the comprehensive care. The objective of this review is to demonstrate the usefulness of the multidisciplinary team for this particular group of patients. Design/Methods: From 2011 to 2017, all neonates and infants aged under 1 year, with malignant solid tumors, managed under the care of the multidisciplinary team in our center were included in the review. The patient data was prospectively collected and then analyzed. Results: In total there were 108 patients aged between 3 days and 1 year (mean 6.8 months). Diagnoses were as follows: neurogenic n=2 (1.8%). In four cases tumors were detected intranatally on the fetal ultrasound scan. In all other cases, the time for making the accurate diagnoses took from 3 to 5 days following the patient presentation. According to internationally accepted guidelines and protocols all patients underwent combined modality therapy including surgical resection of the tumor and metastases. The treatment was completed in 71 patients (65.7%). The overall survival rate was 77% at follow up ranging from 1 to 60 months. 34 patients (31.4%) continue receiving chemotherapy. Conclusions: In our experience the implementation of multidisciplinary team care for neonates and infants younger than 1 year with malignant solid tumors is a very practical approach to making a timely diagnosis and initiating promptly the appropriate treatment thus allowing achievement of the high survival rate. Further study at longer follow up is warranted to evaluate the overall effectiveness of this approach. PD-113 Disease Patterns of Malignant Tumors in Adolescents S. Bhatnagar 1 1B.J.Wadia Hospital for Children Bombay Hospital, Pediatric Surgery, Mumbai, India Background/Objectives: According to Indian demographic profile, pediatric and adolescent population represents 45.7% of the entire population. While most of pediatric malignancies are much researched, little is known about the malignant tumors in adolescents. This population poised between children and adults, has been called the \"lost tribe.\" An attempt is made here to study the demographics, disease patterns and overall outcomes vis\u00e0vis pediatric malignant solid tumors. Design/Methods: Patients aged 1519 years with the diagnosis of malignant tumors, registered with two tertiary care hospitals in Mumbai, India from January 2012 to December 2016 were included. Basic demographic information, clinical, diagnostic details, histology grouping, treatment, outcome and survival were retrospectively studied. Results: Of 36 patients, 20F, 16M, various types of tumors were encountered. In young Carcinosarcoma of abdomen (n=1). Pretherapy staging of the tumors revealed that 22/36 (61%) of the tumors were found to be stage 4, the metastatic nodules being present in the lungs (n=10), abdomen (n= 8), bone/bone marrow (n= 8). Upfront chemotherapy was given to all patients except 4/36. R0 resection of the primary could be achieved in 13/36 patients. Radiotherapy was utilized as adjuvant therapy in 19/36, including primary and metastatic sites. Metastatectomy was performed in 12/22 patients postchemotherapy. Overall survival was 86%, even though all of them were not tumor free. Conclusions: High incidence of advanced malignancies is seen in adolescent age in both boys and girls. The tumors which are encountered in this age group differ in type, biologic behaviour as well as response to therapy. An attempt at early detection and treatment is of vital importance to prevent the presentation at advanced age. Haematology Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia P-001 Prevalence of Tuberculosis Infection in Children with Acute Leukemia A. Ahad 1, R. Seth1, S. Kabra1, S. Vishnu1 1All India Institute of Medical Sciences New Delhi, Pediatrics, New Delhi, India Background/Objectives: Children with acute leukemia are at an increased risk of infections. There are opposing views regarding tuberculosis as an etiology in these patients. The aim of our study was to determine the prevalence of tuberculosis infection in children with acute leukemia, to determine the Mantoux conversion rate during chemotherapy and to determine the disease rate and treatment outcome of tuberculosis. Design/Methods: It was a prospective cohort study at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. A Mantoux test (5.0 tuberculin units) was given prior to chemotherapy to determine the prevalence of tuberculosis infection. Children were monitored for development of tuberculosis disease over one year by doing a repeat Mantoux test at 6 and 12 months of follow up while on chemotherapy or when they developed symptoms of tuberculosis. Risk factors such as BCG vaccination, family history, age, socioeconomic status and malnutrition were assessed. Results: One hundred twentyfive children (93 acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 32 acute myeloid leukemia) aged one to fourteen years (average 6.3 years) were studied. Four percent had tuberculosis infection at diagnosis before chemotherapy. Among the Mantoux negative children, 3.3% became Mantoux positive during chemotherapy. Isoniazid was given for 6 months to all the infected children and none developed tuberculosis during follow up. Mantoux positivity was more in children older than 5 years of age; however, none of the other risk factors had a statistically significant association with tuberculosis infection. Conclusions: Mantoux positivity increases with increasing age and a low prevalence of tuberculosis infection was attributed to a younger population in the study. None of the children who received isoniazid developed disease, emphasizing its efficacy for chemoprophylaxis. The antitubercular effect of chemotherapy like 6mercaptopurine and antimicrobials like quinolones used in febrile neutropenia may play a role. P-002 DNA Index and Triple Trisomy at Diagnosis, and Pattern of Relapse in Children with Acute LYMMPHOBLASTIC Leukemia (A.L.L) - Reporting Results from a Single Institution S. alsweedan 1, R. Jaffri1, A. Alseraihy1, A. alahmari1, I. Ghemlaz1, K. Siddiqui1 1King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Center, pediatric hematology/oncology, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia Background/Objectives: Relapse rate of 1020% in children with A.L.L., is a major hindrance in achieving excellent overall survival rates.To assess the role of Triple trisomy and DNA Index at diagnosis in timing and pattern of site of relapse. Design/Methods: Retrospective review of 455 pediatric (14 years at diagnosis) A.L.L patients' medical charts, diagnosed and treated at our institute from 2005 to 2014. Results: 108 (28.7%) from 376 patients with available DNA Index data were hyperdiploid (HDALL, DNA Index>1.16) while remaining 268 (71.3%) were nonHDALL. 12(22.6%) patients in HDALL group relapsed at a median of 2.3 years (1.1 month - 8.3 years) from first complete remission (CR1). 9 (75%) were testis. Relapses in HDALL group isolated hematopoietic site nonHDALL group (PValue: trisomy (+4,+10, +17) did not exhibit significant role in providing protection from relapse. Relapses in HDALL group were occurring early (median: 2.4 years) compared to nonHDALL group, but the trend was not statistically significant (PValue: 0.572). Fiveyear overall survival for HDALL group (0.952\u00b10.024) was statistically significantly better in nonHDALL 0.116). Triple trisomy with HDALL (PValue<0.001). Conclusions: Significantly different pattern of relapse sites exist between the HDALL and NonHDALL groups but not the timings of relapse in our cohort of pediatric patients. P-003 Allergic Reaction to Asparaginase in Pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (A.L.L.) - Does It Have Any Prognostic Value? S. alsweedan 1, J. RAFAT1, ibrahim1, A. hawazen1, K. Siddiqui1 1King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Center, pediatric hematology/oncology, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia Background/Objectives: We conducted this retrospective study to assess the incidence of allergic reactions to Asparaginase in pediatric A.L.L. patients and to determine if it is of any prognostic significance. Design/Methods: Medical charts of pediatric noninfantile patients diagnosed with A.L.L. registered at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, from 2005 to 2014 were reviewed in retrospective fashion and the outcome data were analyzed in the backdrop of incidence of allergic reaction to Asparaginase. Results: Five hundred and four (504) patients were enrolled in this study. Median age at diagnosis was 4.8 years (MinMax: 1.014.8), with 41.3%(208) girls. Clinical allergic reactions to Asparaginase identified by continual measurement of activity levels, were observed in 95(18.8%) patients. 69.5%(66) of these occurred during consolidation phase. 15.8%(15) were categorized as severe and 42.2%(40) as moderate and mild, each. It was significantly more common in High Risk group than Standard Risk (21.9% vs. 10.2%, PValue: 0.004), relapse was 14.1%(71). Incidence of first relapse was higher in those who did not experience any allergic reaction (14.4%,59 vs. 12.6%,12) but, this protective effect did not achieve statistical significance (PValue: 0.745). Among High Risk patients (374), mortality rate was significantly lower in patients with recorded allergic reaction to Asparaginase (4.9%,4 of 82) than others (15.1%,44 of 292) with Pvalue of 0.014. However, no significance difference was observed in probability of five year Event Free Survival (EFS) between the former and the later (0.854\u00b10.039 vs. 0.797\u00b10.021, PValue: 0.085) for the whole cohort. Conclusions: Early switch to erwinia type after reaction to asperginase improve survival and decrease relapse in patients with ALL P-004 MicroRNA Expression Profiles in Brazilian Childhood TCell Acute (TALL) is a hematologic malignancy that accounts for 15% of childhood ALL, and can affect distinct maturation stages of T cell. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs with an essential role in gene expression regulation and normal hematopoiesis. In this study, we aimed to investigate differential miRNA expression between bone marrow (BM) mononuclear cells from patients with childhood TALL and blood CD8+ T cell from healthy adult and neonatal individuals (control group - CG). Design/Methods: Patients with TALL (7 males, 1 female; median age= 11,5 years) were referred to Instituto de Medicina Integral Professor Fernando Figueira in Recife, Northeast Brazil, where BM was collected. CG data (adult, n=3; neonatal, n=3) were retrieved from (GSM1627014, GSM1627015, GSM1627016, GSM1627017, GSM1627018 and GSM1627019). Total RNA was extracted with TRizol and used for library construction (Illumina Small RNA Kit). MiRNAs were sequenced in HiSeq plataform (Illumina) and data analyzed control, Cutadapt - removing adapters, miRDeep2 - miRNA identification, and edgeR - differential expression (DE)) using miRBase v21 data and hg38 human reference genome. A False Discovery Rate (FDR) 0.05 was considered in DE analysis, and miRNA target prediction was performed by miRWalk 2.0. DAVID v6.8 tools were applied to functional annotation (FA) of miRNA targets. Results: Fortynine miRNAs DE were identified between the two groups, with 33 up and 16 downregulated in TALL. Fourteen thousand, three hundred and eightyone gene targets were predicted, and FA revealed 120 enriched Kegg Pathways (corrected P 0.05), including Metabolic pathways, Pathways in cancer, PI3KAkt signaling pathway, Endocytosis, MAPK signaling pathway and others related to immune system, cancer and cell function. Conclusions: MiRNAs play a role in biological pathways related to cancer development and immune system regulation.

P-005 Demographics and Disease Response Evaluation in Pediatric High Risk Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) Patients at a Tertiary Care Centre S. Anwar 1, M. leukemia (ALL) is commonest malignancy among children.Different Protocols are being used in different part of world to treat ALL. Objective: The main objective of the study is to discuss presentation and outcome of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Design / Methods: STUDY DESIGN: We present a retrospective study, looking at demographics and outcome of children with ALL presented to the hematology and oncology department of the children's hospital Lahore between January 2009 and December 2009. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Children with Bone Marrow biopsy proven ALL were included and data regarding age, gender, risk categorization and outcome were recorded and analyzed. Children were stratified as high risk who were <2 and >9 years of age, BFMrisk factor 1.2 or above, CNS disease and mediastinal mass on presentation. Lahore Group Protocol for acute lymphoblastic Leukemia LALL01(BFM and UKALLXI based ) was used for treatment. Results: A total of 198 patients were included. Seventy percent were males. Majority 141(66.6%) were between 28.9 years of age while 44(22.2%) patients were of 9 years and above. One hundred and sixteen (60%) had high risk disease and only 55(27%) with standard risk. Initial WBC was >100,000/mm3 in 35 (17.6%), 50,000100,000/mm3 in 14 (7%) and 47 (23.7%) had 10,00050,000/mm3. BFM risk factor was 1.2 and above in 66 (33.3%), 14(7%) patients had CNS disease and 5% mediastinal mass on presentation. Seventy eight (40%) patients had completed treatment, 44(22.2%) left against medical advice and 38(19.1%) died. Twenty nine (14.6%) had relapse and among them 76% relapsed while on treatment. Conclusions: High risk disease is the most common presentation of ALL in children at our centre with initial High WBC count, massive organomegaly and male predominance. Abandonment is another major factor affecting the overall survival rate. However overall survival is almost 50% in our treated patients. P-006 Severe Vincristine Toxicity in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia R. Bhuta B. DeNardo1, P. Cole2, K. Island Hematology/Oncology, Providence, USA; 2Montefiore Medical Center, Pediatric Hematolgoy/Oncology, New York City, USA Background/Objectives: An integral part of standard treatment for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) includes the use of vincristine. While significant side effects from vincristine are rare, severe neurotoxicity can occur and result in omission of this chemotherapeutic agent from treatment. This study specifically looked at patients with ALL who had vincristine removed from their therapy plan to assess severity of side effects and disease response. Design/Methods: A retrospective chart review identified 4 patients from 2 institutions with ALL and severe polyneuropathy requiring discontinuation of vincristine. Demographic information and details about individual treatment course in relation to vincristine administration were collected with institutional review board approval. Results: The four children were 3 to 12 years old and were diagnosed with Bcell ALL. They received treatment on or as per Dana Farber Cancer Institute Protocols 05001 or 11001. The first patient developed severe visual loss secondary to optic nerve atrophy, vocal cord dysfunction, and inability to ambulate due to severe peripheral neuropathy prompting discontinuation of vincristine after 5 doses. The second patient developed severe constipation and inability to ambulate secondary to peripheral neuropathy, with discontinuation of vincristine after 6 doses; genetic testing revealed Charcot Marie Tooth type 2D. The 3rd and 4th patients developed inability to ambulate due to significant motor neuropathy, and vincristine was discontinued after 11 doses and 21 doses, respectively. All four children had improvement in their symptoms after discontinuation of vincristine and are currently 236 months off therapy and remain in remission. Conclusions: Severe vincristine toxicity can result in vision loss (optic nerve atrophy), vocal cord dysfunction, constipation, and inability to ambulate (peripheral and motor neuropathy) requiring removal of this agent from standard treatment plans. Discontinuation of vincristine within the first year of treatment in our subset of patients resulted in improvement of symptoms and continued ALL remission. P-007 Expression of CD10 on Residual Cells in Children with BCell Precursor Acute Leukemia K. BukowskaStrakova 1, K. PawiskaWsikowska2, M. Marta3, K. Anna1, B. Walentyna2, S. Maciej1 1Jagiellonian University Medical College PolishAmerican Institute of Pediatric, Department of Clinical Immunology, Krakow, Poland; 2Jagiellonian University Medical College PolishAmerican Institute of Department of Oncology and Hematology, Krakow, Poland; 3University Children's Hospital of Cracow, Clinical Immunology, Krakow, Poland Background/Objectives: The most common childhood malignancy is acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), particularly Bcell precursor ALL (BCPALL). Leukemic cells remaining in the bone marrow are the major cause of relapse, therefore state of minimal residual disease monitoring (MRD) during the induction therapy is consider a strong predicting factor of treatment outcome. Multicolor flow cytometry (MFC) is commonly used technique for monitoring MRD. Design/Methods: MRD was assessed by MFC in patients with BCPALL diagnosed between 20072016 (200 patients). Children were treated according to ALL ICBFM2002 (between 20072012) or according to ALL ICBFM2009 (between 20132016) in Oncology and Hematology Department, Children's University Hospital in Krakow. The level of residual leukemic cells and the quality of antigen expression (mean fluorescence intensity MFI) was assessed on leukemic cell on diagnosis day, 15th and 33th day of induction chemotherapy. To achieve expected sensitivity of the method (104), at least 300.000 of nucleated cells were collected. The sample quality was assessed based on percentage of erythroblasts (<2% poor quality, >2% good quality). Results: The correlation between surface antigen expression and response to prednisone therapy was found. The CD10 MFI was downregulated in patients with good prednisone, yet in patients with poor prednisone, CD10 MFI on leukemic blasts was not altered, suggesting insensitivity to chemotherapy. The most frequent antigenic shifts were seen in CD10, CD34 CD19, CD45, CD38, CD66c were more stable. The percentage of leukemic cells in BCPALL at 15th and 33th day of therapy were negatively correlated with early clinical outcome. Conclusions: Our study shows that not only the quantitative MRD results are important, but also qualitative changes of immunophenotype of residual leukemic cells might give additional clinical information, especially, in poor quality samples, with admixture of peripheral blood. P-008 TransfusionRelated Iron Overload (TRIO) in Children with Leukemia/Lymphoma C. Cacciotti 1, U. Athale1, S. Millson1 1McMaster Children's Hospital, Department of Pediatrics, Hamilton, Canada Background/Objectives: Children with cancer commonly receive red blood cell (RBC) transfusions. Transfusionrelated iron overload (TRIO) is a common complication and a significant iron burden is documented after only 10 RBC transfusions. Despite heavy transfusions, few studies have evaluated TRIO in children with cancer and no guidelines for screening exist. Design/Methods: A retrospective chart review, observational study was performed to evaluate the screening practices for TRIO in children (<18 years) with leukemia/lymphoma. In addition to demographic data, ferritin values, and number of RBC transfusions were extracted. Results: The study cohort included 155 eligible patients, 91 (59%) had standard risk (SR) ALL, 52 (33%) high risk (HR) ALL, and 12 (8%) AML. The mean age at diagnosis was 6 years (range 5 months 18 years). Overall 34% of patients received > 10RBC transfusions; SRALL median 6 (range 092), HRALL median 12 (range 463) and AML median 23 (range 856) transfusions. Patients with HRALL and AML were more likely to receive >10 transfusions (58% and 92% respectively) in comparison to those with SRALL (14%). Ferritin levels were measured in 105 patients (68%); and were elevated (>1,000mcg/L) in 22 (14%). Evaluation of iron overload with Ferriscan was performed in 4 patients (2%). Conclusions: The iron burden was not routinely evaluated, despite high number RBC transfusions. Screening for TRIO should be incorporated into routine practice in children with leukemia/lymphoma. P-009 Enhancer Role of rMnSOD in Apoptosis Triggering by Daunorubicin of Pediatric BAll Cells F. Casale 1, V. D'Angelo1, A. Pica2, A. SUN, and General and Specialistic Surgery, Naples, Italy; 2Federico II University Naples, Department of Naples, Italy; Institute \"Fondazione Pascale\", Exp. Oncology, Naples, Italy Background/Objectives: Leukemic cells produce higher amounts of ROS than healthy cells and express low levels of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Recently, it was demonstrated that rMnSOD, a recombinant new isoform of MnSOD, recently isolated from human liposarcoma cell line, is able to trigger apoptosis of human TALL cells (99%) without toxic effects on healthy cells. The present study was aimed to verify if rMnSOD is able to induce apoptosis and to stop in G0/G1 stage of the cell cycle in pediatric patients with Bcell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and if it displays synergic action with daunorubicin. Design/Methods: Cells were collected from three patients diagnosed for Bcell ALL at the Pediatric Oncology of University \"Luigi Vanvitelli\". Cell viability, apoptosis and cell cycle of lymphoblasts and SUPB15 cell line (ATCC) were analyzed through \" Muse Kit\" after rMnSOD treatment. ROS analysis was detected with NAC. Apoptotic fragmentations of SUPB15 were demonstrated by confocal imaging. Results: We observed that low concentrations of rMnSOD are able to trigger apoptosis of SUPB15 cell line and BALL cells from pediatric patients. In detail, we observed an apoptosis rate from 30% to 46% in BALL pediatric patient cells and of 45% in SUPB15 cell line. Instead, cell cycle analysis showed a cell fraction decrease in G0/G1 phase. Moreover, the synergic activity of rMnSOD and Daunorubicin induces apoptosis in 92% of cells, by comparing the treatment with the single substances, rMnSOD (64,7%) and Daunorubicin in cells and evident apoptotic alterations, such as nuclear fragmentations and apoptoticbodies. Conclusions: In conclusion, rMnSOD exerts toxic activity only against cancer cells, by enhancing drug effect, thus allowing to utilize lower concentration of standard chemotherapy to increase the apoptosis level. P-010 MIR125 as Biomarkers in Chemo Resistant Leukemic F. 1, M. Ramaglia1, A. Iannotta1, D'Angelo1 1Universit\u00e0 della Campania \"L.Vanvitelli\" SUN, Department of Women Children and General and Specialized Surgery, Naples, Italy; 2Universit\u00e0 della Campania \"L.Vanvitelli\" SUN, Department of Pathology, Naples, Italy Background/Objectives: The microRNAs (MiRNA) are involved in the differentiation process of various hematopoietic lineages. Their dysregulation has now clearly been linked to cancer and particularly to leukemia and to drug resistant process MiRNA miR125b is the ortholog of lin4 in Caenorhaditis elegans. As lin4 is implicated in several developmental processes and miR125b negatively regulates many proteins in the p53 pathway, the deregulation of miR125b expression would impair human and mouse hematopoiesis. Recently, miR125b and its homolog miR125a are analyzed and resulted highly expressed in hematopoietic stem cells. In these studies, miR125b was found to regulate stemcell pool size and to confer a competitive advantage to engrafting hematopoietic cells. MiRNA 125b can function dually as both an oncogene and tumorsuppressor gene depending on the cancer type and cellular context. Aim of our study was to analyze the expression and correlation with biologic profile of these MiRna in patients with ALL Bcell or Tcell. Design/Methods: We examined expression levels of miR125b in 57 children (37 of ALL Bcell and 20 of ALL Tcell) diagnosed and treated to the Pediatric Oncology of the University \"Luigi Vanvitelli\", and in two cell lines, SUPB15 and Jurkat. Mononuclear cells were isolated from bone marrow samples whereas the biologic fluids (serum and spit) were collected from ALL children. We tested the expression levels of miR125b by quantitative RTPCR at diagnosis and after complete remission (to 33\u00b0 and 78\u00b0 day). Results: Preliminary data showed that miR125b expression in ALL Bcell samples were upregulated (27/37, 73%), whereas the expression in samples, 90%). Interestingly, the 29% (8/27) of overexpressed BALL samples resulted high risk. Conclusions: These data support the hypothesis that aberrant expression of miR125b might contribute to leukemogenesis and the overexpression is important in the biologic profile of high risk leukemic patients. P-011 Adverse Events in Children with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia Treated from 19942011. SingleCentre Retrospective Study in Poland Szapiska1, K. Adamczewska2, Molenda2, P. MarciniakStpak1, J. Wachowiak1, K. 1 Hematology and Transplantology, Poland; Transplantology Students Paediatric Society, Poznan, Poland Background/Objectives: The aim of this study was a retrospective analysis of adverse events in children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) treated between 19942011 at Department of Pediatric Haematology and Transplantology in Poznan, Poland. Design/Methods: Between 19942001, 103 children with ALL (48 [46.6%] girls, 55 [53.4%] boys) aged 117 (med 5 yrs) were stratified into SRG:69 [67%], HRG:34 [33%] and treated with the ALL BFM90 and the New York (NY) protocols, respectively. According to ALL IC BFM 2002 criteria 196 pts (90 [46%] girls, 106 [54%] boys) aged 118 (med 5.04 (27%), IRG74 Results: and NY protocol, CR1 was achieved in SR: 94.2% and HR: 87.9% pts. Treatment failures were due to: therapy complications 2/102(2%) in HR only. Relapses treated with IC BFM 2002 CR1 was achieved by 190 (97%) pts. Among adverse events 29 (14.8%) relapses were observed (1.179 months (SR). There were 27 (13.8%) deaths due to: early because of sepsis (1; were most frequent in children regardless of the protocol. Patients treated with ALL IC BFM 2002 suffered from isolated CNS and mixed relapses more often, than those with ALL BFM90. There were no deaths due to treatment complications in SR group. P-012 Results of Treatment with Nelarabine in Relapsed TCell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (TALL) in Children Report of Polish Paediatric Leukemia/Lymphoma Study Group (PPLLSG) P. MarciniakStepak1, K. Szczepanski5, J. Poland; and Oncology, Katowice, Poland Background/Objectives: Although good prognosis in children with ALL, there is still 20% risk of relapse. Current protocols for relapse treatment are not highly effective in breaking resistance of TALL, therefore there is a need for an alternative therapies. Nelarabine (AraG) may cause significant benefit in patients with TALL leading to longterm second remission (CR2). The aim was a retrospective analysis of results achieved in relapsed TALL patients treated with AraG prepared by PPLLSG. Design/Methods: Between 20092015 in 5 Polish centers of pediatric oncology in 8 patients (8 boys) with TALL, diagnosed at age 1.713.4 years (median 3.8 years), relapse was treated according to ALLREZ 2002 (1 patient) or IntReAll2010HR (7 patients). Due to resistance and no CR2, protocol with AraG was introduced. Results: Relapse was seen 6.745.6 months (median 15.85 mths) after diagnosis (during first line [6 pts] or after completing treatment [2 pts; 2.7 and 36.9 mths]). There were 4 isolated bone marrow (BM) and 4 mixed relapses (1 BMlymph nodes, 1 BMmediastinum, 1 BMcentral nervous system, 1 BMtestis). Due to failure of previous treatment (5 pts: no CR2 after second line treatment; 2 pts: relapse after alloHSCT; 1 pt: multiple relapses) AraG was introduced as a single drug (1 pt) or NECTAR (AraG/VPCy)(7 pts). In 4 pts: 1, 2 pts: 2 and 2 pts: 3 cycles with AraG were given. No significant adverse effects and toxicities were observed. Among 8 pts CR2 was achieved in 6 pts (75%); in 5 pts alloHSCT was performed, 1 had another relapse. In 2 pts (25%) there was a progression of ALL. Currently 3/8 pts (37.5%) in CR2 are alive, while 5/8 pts died (62.5%) due to: progression (2), infection (2), toxicity after alloHSCT (1). Conclusions: AraG is an effective alternative drug in patients with relapsed TALL not combined with significant toxicities. P-013 A CostEffective, High Sensitivity 10Color Single Based BCell Acute (BCPALL) (MRD) D. 2Tata Memorial Hospital, Pediatric Oncology, Mumbai, India Background/Objectives: Minimal residual disease (MRD) is widely used for monitoring treatmenteffectiveness, riskstratification and even for treatment modification. Hence, methodology for MRD assessment needs to be accurate, fast, sensitive and affordable. Previous studies have shown that flowcytometry based MRD (FCMRD) cannot reach beyond \"1 in 104\" sensitivity. We are presenting a study of high sensitivity, cost effective 10color BCPALLFCMRD assay. Design/Methods: We studied 234 cases of pediatric years) BCPALL registered under ICICLEtreatment protocol (modified BFMprotocol). MRD monitored in 284 bonemarrow (PC) tube FCMRD assay. MRD was defined as cluster 20 events with minimum two immunophenotypic abnormalities. Results: We studied 234 pediatric (<15 year) BCPALL cases for high sensitivity FCMRD monitoring. High number of events were acquired for MRDassay (medianevents, 4561000; range, Of 284 PCMRD were 40 (14%) and SFU were 10 (6.1%). Of 284 samples, MRD was positive in 121(42.6%) (median MRD level, 0.028%; range, 0.0002% to 48.3%). We 24%, with MRDlevels 0.01% and >1.5 million acquiredevents, the results were compared between timegated initial 500000events, and 1000000 events versus all events acquired. Of them, eighteen samples turned MRDnegative in initial 500000events and eleven in initial 1000000events (since MRDevents were <20) highlighting the importance of acquisition of >1.5 million cells to increase the sensitivity of FCMRD assay. Conclusions: We established a costeffective 10color single tube FCMRD assay with high sensitivity of 1 in 105 and applicability in >97% MRD samples. Our study showed that acquisition of events 1 million cells can reduce the sensitivity of FCMRD assay significantly. P-014 Treating Adolescents with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in a ResourcePoor Setting: A Challenging Proposition N. Dhingra 1, 1All Institute of Medical Sciences, Hematology, New Delhi, India Background/Objectives: Adolescents with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are distinct from their pediatric counterparts in terms of disease biology and outcomes. The high success rates of pediatric ALL have thus far eluded this cohort of patients. We describe our experience of managing adolescent patients with ALL in a developing nation. Design/Methods: Medical records of adolescents (age 11 18 years) with ALL treated as per a uniform augmented BFM protocol between 2011 and 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. Results: Seventyfour patients met the inclusion criteria of which 64 were evaluable. The median age was 15 years, malefemale ratio was 9.6:1. Fortyfour patients (68.75%) had BALL and 20 (31.25%) had T ALL. The median presenting WBC count was 41630/mm3 (range 600800000/mm3). 20 patients (31.25%) had a presenting WBC count of >1, 00,000/mm3. Adverse cytogenetics were seen in 5 patients while 3 had favourable cytogenetics, the remainder being normal. Of 61 patients whose baseline CNS status was available, 55 were CNS 1, 3 were CNS 2, 2 were CNS 3 and 4 had a traumatic tap without blasts. Early treatment response, assessed by day 7 bone marrow, was performed in 55 patients of which 30 (54.5%) were M1, 7 (12.7%) were M2 and 18 (32.7 %) were M3. Nine patients died during induction and 2 had refractory disease. Therapy omissions due to infectious or drugrelated complications were observed in 34.38%. Remission rates were 82.8% at end of induction. Relapses were documented in 17 (26.56%) patients (8 CNS, 8 medullary, 1 combined). Kaplanmeier estimates for 2 year eventfree survival were 44.74 % (CI 29.6 to 60.05 %). Conclusions: Adolescents in this study had poor outcomes. An Increased prevalence of highrisk features such as male preponderance, Tcell phenotype, elevated presenting WBC count and poor therapy responses on day 7 were identified. P-015 Target for Minimal Residual Disease Detection in Pediatric Patients with PHIALL: IG/TCR Rearrangements is useful quantitativePCR MRD detection. In PhiALL cases, qRTPCR quantification ofBCRABL1 transcript can be used as additional target. Aims: 1To compare MRD results detected by both methodologies. 2To evaluate the predictive value of both targets as prognostic factors. Design/Methods: A total of 212 followup samples from 16 PhiALL patients were analyzed. MRD for Ig/TCR was performed following standardized EuroMRD recommendations. BCRABL1 minor/major transcripts quantification was performed as described in EAC program. Results: BCRABL1 was quantified in 201 and Ig/TCR in 164 samples. Onehundredfiftysix samples were available for analysis by both techniques, correlation coefficient: 0.5725(p<0.00001). Concordant results by both methods were observed in 15(9.6%) positive and 51(32.7%) negative samples. However, 90(57.7%) samples showed MRD positivity only by BCRABL1, with a median of 0.036; [r:0.00177.9]%. Of them, 40(44.4%) were 0.1%. No cases were positive only by Ig/TCR. From the 15 samples positive by both methods, 2 samples showed >1 logdifference between BCRABL1 and Ig/TCR values, median logdifference: 0.21 [r:0.591.49]. Outcome: Fourteen patients achieved complete remission (CR). Two patients died in CR, 3 relapsed and 11 remain in CR (median followup:32 months). MRD0.1% was observed in 2/3 relapsed patients by both targets. In the group of 11 CCR patients, MRD0.1% was found in 4 patients by Ig/TCR (4 day33; 0 week12) and 9 by BCRABL1 (any time point). MRDIg/TCR<0.1% at week12 correlated with better outcome (p<0.00001). Conclusions: No correlation was observed between both MRD methods, with almost 60% of samples being positive by BCRABL1 while negative by Ig/TCR. Regarding the prognostic value of MRD targets, Ig/TCR<0.1% at week12 showed a significant correlation with outcome, while both measurements of Ig/TCR on day33 and BCRABL1 at any followup time were not significantly associated with outcome. P-016 Reducing Hospital Length of Stay for Patients Newly Diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia A. DiNofia 1, J. Wilkes2, T. Flaherty3, S.P. Hunger1, A. Reilly1 1Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Department of Pediatrics Division of Oncology, Philadelphia, USA; 2Seattle Children's Hospital, Department of Pediatrics Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Seattle, USA; 3Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Office of Clinical Quality Improvement, Philadelphia, USA Background/Objectives: Most patients with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) were discharged after day 8 of chemotherapy and many stayed 23 weeks into their first month of therapy, called Induction. The goal of this quality improvement project was to reduce the length of stay (LOS) for patients newly diagnosed with ALL to less than 5 days after the start of chemotherapy. Design/Methods: Clinicians, nurses, and administrators were educated on the data regarding the safety of earlier discharge from the hospital and the plan for implementation of an earlier discharge goal at CHOP. Family education, planned procedures, and chemotherapy side effect surveillance and management that usually take place in the inpatient setting were transitioned to the outpatient clinic. LOS following administration of first chemotherapy was measured. In addition, the average number of emergency department (ED) visits, inpatient and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, telephone calls from parents, and sick visits into oncology clinic within the Induction course were collected to ensure these metrics did not rise following implementation of this new practice. Results: The mean LOS following administration of the first dose of chemotherapy was reduced by 78.5% from 20 days in the months prior to the intervention was implemented to 4.3 days 11 months after the intervention was introduced. There was no change in average number of ED visits, inpatient and ICU admissions, telephone calls from parents, or sick visits into oncology clinic during Induction following patients' initial discharge. Conclusions: It is feasible and safe to discharge newly diagnosed patients with ALL from the hospital within 5 days of initiation of treatment. P-017 CostAnalysis of Treatment of Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Based on UKALL Protocol M. Ehsani 1, H. Hayati2, E. S. Nikfar2, M. Tashvighi3, A. 1Tehran Sciences, Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Tehran, Iran; 2Tehran University of Medical Administrationic and Oncology, Tehran, Iran; 3MAHAK Charity Hospital, Pediatric Oncology, Tehran, Iran Background/Objectives: Health systems have adopted financing to enhance access to care for patients with cancer. the cost of ALL treatment is a blurred image for hospitals and third party payers. The cost of each component of the care should be analyzed to differentiate justifiable cost and to act on waste full practices. This study on the direct and indirect costs of ALL based on the United Kingdom protocol (UKALL), in pediatrics ALL management in Iran. Design/Methods: A retrospective study design was used to study children with ALL managed with UKALL protocol in specialized pediatric hospitals from 20102015. The data was collected from patients' medical records. MsoNormal style='tabstops:252.75pt;border:none; Health systems have adopted financing to enhance access to care for patients with cancer. the cost of ALL treatment is a blurred image for hospitals and third party payers. The cost of each component of the care should be analyzed to differentiate justifiable cost and to act on waste full practices. Aims: a study on the direct and indirect costs of ALL based on the United Kingdom protocol (UKALL), in pediatrics ALL management in Iran. Results: The total direct medical cost per patient was 8282 US dollars. Most of costs were from inpatient beds (3338\u00b11110 USD) and drug expenditures (2157\u00b11035 USD). The direct nonmedical cost incurred by study participants was 1286.4 USD, The total indirect cost of due to productivity loss was 769.9. Conclusions: Treatment of pediatrics ALL is less costly in Iran comparing other countries. So, physicians and policy makers and health care system administrators should devise an appropriate strategy to reduce the direct medical costs which have more economic burden special for hospitalization days and chemotherapy costs based on the findings. P-018 CostEffectiveness of PediatricInspired vs HyperCVAD Protocols for FirstLine Treatment of Adolescent and Young Adult (AYA) Patients with PhiladelphiaNegative Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) E. Hooper1, X. Xingdi Hu P. Lin3 1Shire, Medical Director Oncology, Cambridge, 2Shire, GHEORE, 3Shire, Global HEOR Lead Oncology, Cambridge, USA Background/Objectives: Various protocols exist for firstline treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in adolescents and young adults (AYA; aged 1639 years). Evidence suggests pediatricinspired protocols for ALL that include asparaginase as part of a multitherapy chemotherapy regimen are associated with better outcomes than conventional adult regimens, such as HyperCVAD (hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, of pediatricinspired protocols versus HyperCVAD in AYA patients is limited. The objective of this study was to estimate the costeffectiveness of a pediatricinspired protocol (CALG10403) versus HyperCVAD for firstline treatment of AYA patients with Philadelphianegative (Ph) ALL from a US payer perspective. Design/Methods: A 6state Markov model was developed to estimate overall survival, treatmentrelated costs, and qualityadjusted life years (QALYs) over a lifetime horizon. The modeled health states were: no first complete remission, first complete remission, first relapse, second complete remission, second relapse, and death. Model inputs for survival, adverse events, health utility, and costs were obtained from published sources. Costeffectiveness was measured by the incremental costeffectiveness ratio (ICER; incremental costs/QALY gained). Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate uncertainty around model input values. Results: The basecase analysis suggested that the pediatricinspired protocol resulted in increased QALYs and reduced costs (QALYs gained, 2.05; cost savings, $41,685) compared with the HyperCVAD protocol. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the probability of receiving stem cell transplantation at second complete remission was the key driver of costeffectiveness. At a willingnesstopay threshold of $50,000/QALY, the probability of the pediatricinspired protocol being costeffective relative to HyperCVAD was 92%. is costeffective compared to HyperCVAD for firstline treatment of AYA patients with Ph ALL. Cost should not be a barrier to the use of a pediatricinspired protocol in AYA patients. Reference: 1. Ram R., et al. Am J Hematol 2012. P-019 Systematic Literature Review and MetaAnalysis of Event Free Survival and Overall Survival Rates for Pegaspargase in Pediatric Patients with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia E. Hopper 1, A. Wijatyk2, D. Bollag3 1Shire, Medical Director Oncology, Cambridge, USA; Clinical Development Lead at Shire, Cambridge, USA; 3Shire, Global Franchise PEGylated Lasparaginase (pegaspargase, PEGASP) is a foundational component of combination therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that, when compared to native asparaginase (nativeASP), offers sustained asparaginase activity with less frequent dosing and reduced immunogenicity. The objective of this assessment was to compare the clinical benefit of PEGASP vs nativeASP in newly diagnosed pediatric ALL patients with regard to event free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS). Design/Methods: A systematic literature review was undertaken to identify all available evidence for newly diagnosed patients treated in pediatric ALL protocols using PEGASP or native ASP. Randomized and observational studies were included. Outcomes were EFS and OS. Safety/immunogenicity was also examined. Asparaginasespecific pooled estimates were calculated by patient risk level. Results: A total of 39 studies met criteria for abstraction; 13 used PEGASP and 27 used native ASP. For standardrisk patients treated with native ASP, 5year EFS was 82% (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 7588) vs 80% (95% CI 7387) for native ASP and PEGASP, respectively. Safety was consistent with the product class for both asparaginases. Conclusions: The results of this assessment support a favorable efficacy profile for PEGASP vs. native ASP in treatment of newly diagnosed pediatric patients with ALL, with the benefits of less frequent administration. Safety was consistent with the known class profile. P-020 MIR3117 and MIR3689D2 in MAPK Signaling Pathway: Implication in Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Susceptibility A. Gutierrezcamino1, I. Martinguerrero1, N. Garcia De Andoin2, A. Navajas3, A. M. Garciaariza 6, Astigarraga6, Garciaorad1 1University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU, Genetics Anthropology Recently, Genome wide associations studies (GWAS) have found genetic variants associated with pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) risk. These studies were mainly focused in coding regions. Nowadays, it is known that more than 40% of significant variants associated with cancer risk are situated in noncoding regions, where noncoding RNAs are located. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are noncoding RNA molecules dysregulated in ALL, suggesting a role in ALL risk. Despite miRNA SNPs interfere with miRNA levels or function, only 3 studies in ALL susceptibility were done, showing significant results. Therefore, variants in miRNAs could contribute to childhood BALL predisposition. Nowadays, a large number of new miRNAS were annotated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine if any of SNPs in these new miRNAs are involved in BALL susceptibility. Design/Methods: Blood samples of 217 pediatric patients with Bcell ALL in complete remission and 330 healthy controls of Spanish origin were analyzed. We selected all the SNPs described in premiRNAs with a MAF>1% (213 SNPs miRNAs). VeraCode GoldenGate platform was used. MirWalk, RNAFold web server and Consensus Path Databases were used to performed bioinformatic analysis. Results: The SNPs rs12402181 in mir3117 and rs62571442 in mir3689d2 were associated with BALL risk possibly through its effect on MAPK signaling pathway. Conclusions: Therefore, in this study we found rs12402181 in mir3117 and rs62571442 in mir3689 associated with BALL risk. These SNPs could be novel markers for BALL susceptibility. This project was supported by UPV/EHU (UFI 11/35) and Basque Government (IT98916). P-021 Experience with Clofarabine use in Refractory/Relapsed Acute Leukemia Pediatric Patients at the Instituto Nacional De Enfermedades Neoplasicas (INEN), LIMA PERU J.L. Garcia 1 Enfermedades Neopl\u00e1sicas, Pediatric Oncology, Lima, Peru Background/Objectives: To know the usefulness of Clofarabine regimens in refractory/relapsed Leukemia patients at our setting and find the best scenario for it's use. Design/Methods: Retrospective review of medical charts of pediatric patients below 15 years old with refractory/relapsed acute leukemia between 2009 and 2017, clinical data, laboratory results and bone marrow results with Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) by flow cytometry study were recorded. Results: Thirty three courses of Clofarabine regimens were administrated in 27 patients with refractory/relapsed acute leukemia, 24 had Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), Clofarabine, Cyclofosfamide and Etoposide (CCE) combination was used in 22 patients, only one patient was in first relapse, he achieved complete remission (CR) with negative MRD, 6 patients were in second relapse, 2 of the evaluable patients had CR, one with negative MRD, in the other the test was not done. Four patients were in third relapse, none had CR. One patient was in fourth relapse, he had CR with positive MRD. Seven patients had refractory disease, only one had CR but with positive MRD. Of the 19 relapsed patients, CR was achieved in 29.4% of them, only one with negative MRD. CCE regimen was used in 8 patients with MRD positive disease, negative MRD was achieved in 75% of them, all of these patients went to bone marrow transplant (BMT) therapy. Severe hematologic toxicity was seen in 87.8% of the courses given, followed by febrile neutropenia in 72.7% and hepatic toxicity in 51.5%, there were 3 patients dead during chemotherapy. Conclusions: CCE regimen was very useful in MRD positive disease, achieving a good rate of negativization of disease, giving the option for BMT therapy. P-022 Efficacy and Toxicity of Inotuzumab in a Patient with Relapsed/ Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Background/Objectives: The outcome of relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in childhood is still poor; current chemotherapies' regimen are associated with significant toxicities and scanty responses. Recently, physicians' attention has been directed toward alternative drugs with different mechanism of action compared to standard chemotherapy. Inotuzumab ozogamicin is an antiCD22 monoclonal antibody conjugated to the toxin, calecheamicin. The complex InotuzumabCD22 receptor is rapidly internalized with intracellular calicheamicin release. Calicheamicin binds to the DNA, inducing doublestrand cleavage and apoptosis. Herein we describe the case of a young girl with hypodiploid ALL relapsed for the second time after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Since the patient had an early relapse ( 5 months after BMT) and was resistant to previous chemotherapy, we opted for immunotherapy with Inotuzumab as bridge to a second allogenic BMT. Design/Methods: The drug was administered in monotherapy at the dosage of 1.8 mg/mq/course, given weekly for 3 times, every 29 days. The patient obtained hematological remission after the first course and minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity after the second; a third course was administered before haploidentical transplant. Results: Treatment with inotuzumab was well tolerated; the patient showed grade IV hematological toxicities after the first course and grade III hepatotoxicities in the subsequent cycles. During transplant VOD prophylaxis with defibrotide was administered. During transplant no toxicity was reported; the engraftment occurred at day +13 and MRD negativity was documented at day +35. Unfortunately, 5 months after the second transplant, the patient relapsed again. Conclusions: The good toxicity profile and the efficacy on MRD suggests a larger using of inotuzumab, possibly in combinations with chemotherapy or other biological drugs before BMT; this association could allow longlasting diseasefree survival in patients with relapsed/refractory ALL. Further study are needed to evaluate the optimal use of Inotuzumab to improve cure rates in these patients. P-023 Parvovirus B19 Induced Cytopenias in Children on Maintenance Phase of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) Chemotherapy Lead to Prolonged Chemotherapy Interruptions B. Gupta 1, A. kumar1, N. verma1, G. pant1, A. sharma1 1King Georges Medical University, Pediatrics, Lucknow, India Background/Objectives: Chemotherapy interruptions during maintenance phase of ALL may lead to relapses and hence are avoidable.In the present study role of parvovirus B19 infection in causing these chemotherapy interruptions was evaluated. Design/Methods: A cohort of 90 children with ALL during the maintenance phase chemotherapy of ALL were evaluated for 840 cycles (3 months each,2520 months).IgM,IgG,PCR were done for Parvovirus B19 infection during episodes of cytopenias requiring chemotherapy interruption. Results: Of total 90 patients( 42 new entrants during study period,48 already in various phases),30(33.3%) patients were found to be parvovirus B19 Positive by PCR at various phases of maintenance chemotherapy which was tested on grounds on clinical suspicion. Out of 30 parvovirus B19 positive patients 24 (80%) required multiple blood tranfusions whereas amongst the 60 Parvovirus B19 negative patients only 23(38%) required multiple tranfusions(p<.0.00). During maintenance phase chemotherapy,18 patients had more than 2 episodes of neutropenia and 11 out of 18(61%) patients were parvovirus B19. One twenty two cycles of maintenance phase were observed to be delayed by more than 7 days and parvovirus B19 was found positive in 85 out of 122(69.6%) cycles(p<0.000). Conclusions: Parvovirus B19 infection emerges to be an important cause of cytopenias leading to chemotherapy interruptions in maintenance phase of ALL Chemotherapy. So Screening of ALL patients by PCR in cases of unexplained cytopenias is recommended. P-024 Impact of Invasive Fungal Infections in Children and Adolescents with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in a Resource Poor Setting N. Gupta 1, N. Dhingra1, P. Mishra1, T. 1All Institute of Medical Sciences, Hematology, New Delhi, India Background/Objectives: Infectious morbidity and mortality is a major concern in patients with hematological malignancies. Invasive fungal infections (IFI) during induction chemotherapy in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) can adversely impact outcomes. Experience with fungal infections in children and adolescents during ALL induction from a tertiary care centre in north India is discussed here. Design/Methods: Records of 120 patients (age < 18 years), who underwent ALL induction at our institution between 1/1/2011 and 31/12/2016, were retrospectively reviewed. All patients were on primary prophylaxis with fluconazole. Incidence and characteristics of IFI were identified. We assessed therapy delays and interruptions in this group and the impact of IFI on outcomes. Results: Thirtyone patients (25.8%) out of 120 had evidence of IFI at baseline or during induction chemotherapy. As per standard definitions, 16 (51.6%), 12 (38.7%) and 3 (9.6%) patients had possible, probable and proven fungal infections respectively. Positive galactomannan antigen was documented in 12 (38.7%). Aspergillus species was isolated in all 3 proven cases. The most common site of infection was lungs (83.8%), followed by sinorhinal (6.4%), 2 patients (6.4%) had multiorgan involvement while 1(3.2%) had cutaneous aspergillosis. Therapy omissions and interruptions during induction occurred in 16 cases (51.6%). Induction mortality attributable to progressive fungal infections was 16.1% (5 cases). Median duration of follow up of 26 patients who achieved remission was 9 months (range 154 months). Six patients (23%) out of these had early relapses, of which 5 died. Conclusions: A high incidence of fungal infections, particularly invasive aspergillosis, was observed. Invasive fungal infections during induction lead to morbidity and mortality in patients with ALL and contribute to therapy interruptions, which would influence long term outcomes. P-025 Subclavian Vein Access to Long Term Catheter Placed in the ARM: A New Surgical Strategy in Pediatric Oncology Surgery, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Background/Objectives: To evaluate the follow up and complications of long term catheters implanted in pediatric oncology patients with a subclavian vein puncture and an arm port/tunneled catheter insertion technique Design/Methods: Since 1994, about 140 long term central venous catheters/ year were inserted in the pediatric oncology patients, and the arm was the first choice as site of insertion. Dissection of basilica, brachial and axillar veins were the venous access. Since 2014, puncture of subclavian vein has been used as the first option to venous access in some cases, utilizing the reservoir/tunneled catheter positioned in the arm. A retrospective review of the longterm catheters implanted in pediatric oncology patients from 2014 to 2017, in children ranging from 2 months to 16 years old (median 5 years old) Complications as infections, thrombosis, and rupture were compared in all techniques. Results: 447 long term catheters were inserted, 267 totally implanted and 174 tunneled catheters (in 6 cases weren\u00b4t identified), 294 dissection of arm veins, 115 Subclavian punctions, 6 Jugular punctions (in 26 cases weren't identified). Causes of catheter removal were: infection, thrombosis, obstruction, rupture, exteriorization and others. Infection rates were 15% in port catheters: 12,7% dissection technique 1,1% puncture. Trombosis rates were 1 in port catheters (100% dissection technique) and 2 in tunneled catheters (100% dissection technique). Conclusions: The use of the arm to place the reservoir/tunneled catheter was widely used since 1994, providing a safe, comfortable and a good quality of life during oncologic treatment in children. The use of subclavian vein puncture as venous access to arm reservoir/tunneled catheter insertion has shown a good choice without major complications with literature comparing results. P-026 Single Dose of Folinic Acid Rescue after HighDose Methotrexate is not Associated with Neurotoxicity in Children with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia A. HarilaSaari 1, University Hospital and University of Oulu, PEDEGO Research Unit and Department of paediatrics and adolescents, Oulu, Finland Background/Objectives: Folinic acid (FA) is needed after administration of highdose methotrexate (HDMTX) in order to rescue normal cells from toxicity. Low FA doses have been associated with increased toxicity, including neurotoxicity, whereas high doses may be related to decreased antileukemic effect. NOPHOALL2000 protocol used in Finland included 15 mg/m\u00b2 FA given every 6 hours from 42 hours after HDMTX (5 g/m\u00b2) and continued until serum MTX concentration was < 0.20 mol/L. Extended alkalinization and prehydration (> 12 hours) was used. Only one or two doses were given in patients with rapid clearance of MTX. We studied here the association between low doses of FA after HDMTX and severe clinical toxicity, especially neurotoxicy. Design/Methods: Patient files of 44 children (27 males; mean age at diagnosis 5.7 years) with standard or intermediate risk acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) treated with NOPHOALL2000 protocol in two Finnish centers were reviewed. Data on HDMTX clearance, FA dosing and clinical toxicity with special focus on neurotoxicity were collected and analysed. Results: Patients had received a total of 351 HDMTX courses. After 181 courses (51.6%, CI 46.2-56.9) only one or two doses of FA were administered. Single dose was given after 55 courses (15.7%, CI 12.0-19.9). None of the patients had clinical neurotoxicity. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was performed at the end of treatment in 22 patients and no leukoencephalopathy was detected. Small (3 mm) bilateral high signal intensity lesions in the frontal area were detected in one patient. Low FA doses were not associated with other severe clinical toxicity, steady state MTX concentration, age or gender of the patients. Conclusions: Single dose of FA after HDMTX seems to be sufficient to prevent neurotoxicity in children with ALL who have received extended alkalinization and prehydration and have rapid clearance of MTX. P-027 XRCC1 Gene Polymorphism and the Risk of Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia: A Case Control Study T. Hassan 1, N. Khalifa1, A. Baraka2, M. Abdel Pathology, Zagazig, Egypt Background/Objectives: DNA repair systems have a crucial role in maintaining genome integrity and stability. Defects in repair pathways may promote development of cancer, including leukemia. Currently, research activities have focused on polymorphisms in DNA repair genes as an important component of susceptibility to cancer. Among them, XRCC1 (Xray repair crosscomplementing groups 1) gene polymorphisms were reported to induce defective functional capacity of the DNA Polymerase , PARP, and ligase III enzyme, resulting in defective DNA repair. We aimed to assess whether XRCC1 gene polymorphisms contribute to development of childhood ALL or not, and to evaluate their prognostic significance as regards to induction of remission and relationship to wellknown pretreatment risk factors. Design/Methods: A case control study was carried out at clinical pathology and pediatric oncology departments, Zagazig University, Egypt, during period from March 2016 to February 2017. Ninety subjects were included ;45 children with denovo ALL and 45 age and sex matched healthy children as a control group.Patients were subjected to complete history taking, thorough clinical examination and routine laboratory investigations according to our local standards. Genotyping of XRCC1 gene polymorphisms was performed for all study participants using polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCRRFLP). Results: There was no significant difference between patients and controls as regards to different XRCC1 genotypes. Apart from the significant association between Arg 399 Gln and Gln 399 Gln genotypes and common ALL immunophenotype, there was no significant difference among XRCC1 genotypes in relation to any of the demographic,clinical and laboratory data of patients as well as remission rates. Conclusions: There is no relation between XRCC1 gene polymorphism and risk of developing ALL in children. Apart from the significant association between certain XRCC1 genotypes and common ALL immunophenotype, XRCC1 gene polymorphism has no prognostic significance in childhood ALL. Larger studies are still needed to support our findings. P-028 Differences Between Urban and Rural Areas of CastillaLeon in the Incidence and Survival of Childhood Leukemias (SPAIN) R. Garrote Molpeceres1, R. Herraiz Spain Background/Objectives: To analyze the differences between urban and rural children population in incidence and survival of children under 15 years old diagnosed with leukemia in the region of CastillaLe\u00f3n (Spain) during the period 20032014. Design/Methods: Leukemia cases were extracted from the registry of childhood tumors of population base of CastillaLe\u00f3n, with an annual mean of childhood population of 296,776 children under 15 years old. Cases were classified by age and sex. Leukemia incidence was adjusted by age to world population (ASRw, 95%CI) and their differences through standardized rate. For threeyear survival analysis, we included cases with followup until 31/12/2013. Survival rates were calculated by KaplanMeier analysis and their comparisons with logrank test. Rural population was considered to be one with 20,000 habitants. Results: From 155 leukemias diagnosed, we could identify the rural/urban population in 145(93.55%), 79(54.48%) rural and 66(45.52%) urban. Leukemia incidence was significantly greater in rural areas [ASRw: 51.08(40.3164.02) vs 33.65(25.9343.07)], p=0.018. Incidence analysis by age showed greater significantly rural leukemia incidence in 04 years old children [ASRw: 59.23(39.9684.56) vs 36.18(22.9354.28)], p<0.0001. Global survival was of 83%(76.188), with a mean followup of 7.25 years (Quartiles: 3.779.5). Urban leukemia survival was significantly less than rural [76%(64.584.2) vs 91%(82.995.4)], p=0.005. There were no survival differences by sex in 04 years old children between rural and urban populations. In the 59 years old group, female survival was greater in rural areas (p=0,006) and in the 1014 years old group, survival was greater in males from rural areas (p=0.018). Conclusions: We found higher incidence of childhood leukemia in rural areas due to an increase of incidence in 04 years old children. Survival was greater in rural areas in children older than 5 years at diagnosis. These differences in incidence and survival could help to investigate epigenetic or environmental factors of childhood leukemia. P-029 IDH1 and KRAS Mutations are Involved in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in Maffucci Syndrome S. Hirabayashi 1, M. Seki2, Hasegawa1, J. Takita2, A. Manabe1 1St. Luke's International Hospital, Department of Pediatrics, Tokyo, Japan; 2University of Tokyo, Department of Pediatrics, Tokyo, Japan; 3National Center for Child Health and Development, Children's Cancer Center, Tokyo, Japan; 4Hospital of University of the Ryukyu, Center of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Okinawa, Japan; 5St. Luke's International University, Institute for Medical Innovation, Tokyo, Japan; 6Graduate School of Medicine Kyoto University, Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Kyoto, Japan; 7Institute of Medical Science University of Tokyo, Laboratory of DNA Information Analysis Human Genome Center, Tokyo, Japan; 8National Center for Child Health and Development, Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Research, Tokyo, Japan Background/Objectives: Somatic mosaic mutations of the genes encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1, IDH2) cause Maffucci syndrome, rare nonhereditary disorders in which patients develop multiple enchondromas combined with hemangiomas. Although malignant transformation of enchondromas to chondrosarcomas and secondary neoplasms, such as brain tumors or acute myeloid leukemia, are serious complications, reports of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) as a secondary neoplasm are limited. Design/Methods: In this study, we present a 15yearold girl with Maffucci syndrome who developed Bcell precursor (BCP)ALL as a secondary neoplasm. IDH1 and IDH2 mutations in leukemic cells at relapse and hemanigoma were screened by Sanger sequencing. Additionally, whole exome sequencing and SNP array were done in leukemic cells at relapse. Results: The girl was diagnosed Maffucci syndrome because of shortness of right arm and hemangioma at infant. At the age of 12 years, she had fever, anemia and severe pain on her systemic body. Bone marrow examination revealed necrotic bone marrow and chondromatosis. She had severe anemia 6 months later, and was diagnosed with Bprecursor ALL. She received chemotherapy, however, she relapsed at the age of 15 years 4 months after cessation of maintenance therapy. Mutational analysis of IDH1 revealed p.R132C in leukemic cells A somatic mutation in IDH1 c.394C>T (encoding p.R132C) was detected in her hemangioma and leukemic cells, and the KRAS mutation c.38G>A (encoding p.G13D) and deletion ofIKZF1 were detected in her leukemic cells. Conclusions: Patients with Maffucci syndrome might be at risk of BCPALL associated with secondary genetic events that affect lymphocyte differentiation. Our observations suggest that secondary mutations may account for the development of ALL in patients with Maffucci syndrome. Prospective registration of any patient suspected of genetic predisposition is mandatory to identify the mechanism of leukemogenesis and variation of penetrance of ALL. P-030 Isolation of Pathogenic Bacteria and Their Antibiotic Sensitivity Profiles in Hospitalized Febrile Neutropenic Children with Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the commonest malignancies in childhood. Common obstacle in the treatment of ALL is febrile neutropenia and its complications. To identify bacteria causing infection, their isolation rate and antibacterial sensitivity pattern in hospitalized febrile neutropenic children with ALL in different cycle of chemotherapy. Design/Methods: This cross sectional study conducted in 2014 2015 in the department of paediatric haematology/ oncology, BSMMU, Dhaka BANGLADESH. Sixty febrile neutropenic episodes from 52 diagnosed cases of ALL aged 0 to18 years were included. Complete blood count, blood culture, urine microscopy and culture, serum alanine aminotransferase, serum every patient. Xray chest, stool microscopy and culture, pus, wound, throat and aural swab for culture & sensitivity were done in selective patient. Results: Bacterial infection was confirmed by culture in 15 (25%) episodes from 60 febrile neutropenic episodes. Fifteen (25%) organisms were isolated from the study subjects from sample of blood (60%), pus (13.3%), aural swab (13.3%), wound swab (6.7%) and throat swab (6.7%) respectively. All isolates were gram negative. The organism isolated were Klebsiella spp 5 (33.31%), E. coli 4 (26.7%),Acinetobacter 2 (13.3%) and only one (6.7%) species. isolates of the Klebsiella spp., E.coli and Acinetobacter spp. were resistant of Klebsiella were the gentamicin, ciprofloxacin and sensitive to imipenem, piperacillintazobactam. P-031 Bone Disease in Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia K. Katsibardi 1, K. Roka1, G. Avgerinou1, Orthopaedic Unit, Athens, Greece Background/Objectives: Bone abnormalities, such as low bone mineral density, osteoporosis and nontraumatic bone fractures, frequently occur in children under chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Their pathogenesis seems to be multifactorial, due to chemotherapeutic agents and the leukemic process. Design/Methods: Children diagnosed with ALL were evaluated in regards to the occurrence of bone abnormalities within a 4year period (January 2013 December 2016). Severe bone abnormalities were defined as: significant bone pain associated with activity restrictions, and significant loss of bone mineral resulting in objective osteoporosis or/and nontraumatic bone fractures. Results: During this period, 70 children were diagnosed with ALL (N=35, 50% girls), of median age 4.42 years (range: 1.02 16.91 years). Among them twelve (17%) experienced bone abnormalities. Bone pain with activity restriction and gait disturbances was observed in eight patients, half at diagnosis and during maintenance. Four patients experienced bone fractures (two at diagnosis, one during reinduction and one during maintenance). Osteoporosis was documented in two patients, at maintenance. Four patients (3 girls / 1 boy, of six, ten, thirteen and fifteen years old) developed aseptic necrosis of femoral head with severe limping. Most patients were treated conservatively. Arthroplasty was performed in 1/4 patients after maintenance completion. Four children received Zoledronic acid, with median number of 6 doses, for 13.2 months (median duration). Symptoms improved slowly and had resolved by the end of treatment. Bone mineral density measured at the dual energy xray absorptiometry (DEXA) return to ageappropriate levels by a median period of seven months. Conclusions: We documented a high incidence of bone disease in children with ALL. Bisphosphonate therapy with Zoledronic acid seems to decrease skeletal pain and increase bone density. Early recognition of patients at risk and timely application of adequate preventive and therapeutic measures are essential to prevent this debilitating complication in ALL patients. P-032 Prevalence and Clinical Correlation of TPMT, ITPA and NUDT15 Gene Polymorphisms in Children with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia in North India S. Khera 1, A. nucleotide for metabolizing enzymes; with thiopurine Smethyltransferase (TPMT) analysis being recommended prior to maintenance therapy in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). However, inosine motif 15 appear more important in the Asian population. Design/Methods: In this prospective Mendelian randomisation study consecutive patients with ALL ( Jan 2016 to Jun 2016), entering maintenance phase were evaluated for TPMT, ITPA and NUDT15 by PCR were monitored for 9 months.The two groups with and without SNP's mutation (Mut+ and Mut) were compared. Results: Sixty three patients of ALL [5.3 years (4.61 6.06)] underwent molecular analysis. Fifty eight were followed for 9 months. Eighteen (28.6%) patients had SNP mutations. All mutations except 1 ITPA were heterozygous. Mean cumulative dose of 6MP was lower 10927 mg/m2 in Mut+ compared to 12533 mg/m2 in (P=0.009). Neutropenic events were greater in Mut+ (P=0.03), Weeks of full dose of 6 MP were lower in Mut + (21 versus 30; P=0.0009). Risk of Neutropenia>2 weeks was pronounced (OR=4.41; 95%CI 1.2116; P=0.024) and the weeks off chemotherapy were greater in Mut + group (5 versus 2.8; P=0.019). The ITPA and NUDT SNP subgroups had similar cumulative 6MP doses and chemotherapy interruptions. There was no difference in average cumulative dose of Methotrexate in 2 groups. Malnourishment did not correlate with doses. No significant hepatotoxicity was noted. Conclusions: Polymorphisms in 6MP metabolizing enzymes are notably related to ethnic ancestry. TPMT (3.1%) SNP's do not appear to have a significant role in our population. ITPA (17.5%) and NUDT (9.5%) polymorphisms appear to be the important SNP's in the north Indian population for optimizing chemotherapy doses. P-033 Dual Inhibition of BetaCatenin and RAS by Targeting AXINRGS Domain (KYA1797K*) in Acute Center Yonsei University Health System, Department of Pediatrics, SEOUL, Republic of Korea Background/Objectives: Signaling pathways in acute leukemia are aberrantly activated to cause leukemogenesis and relapse after treatment. Upregulation of WNT/betacatenin pathway is common and hyperactive RAS is strongly associated with treatment resistance in leukemia. Small molecule therapy opened a new window for cancer treatment but targeting one subject may have limitations. KYA1797K binds directly to RGS domain of axin and enhances the betacatenin destruction complex which activates GSK3beta and results in degradation of betacatenin and RAS. In the current study, the effects of KYA1797K on acute leukemia were studied in leukemic cell monoculture and in coculturing (0.210 microM) of KYA1797K and with Erlotinib (1 microM) for comparison. Cell proliferation assay on KYA1797K was done and Immunoblotting for betacatenin, GSK3beta, PanRAS was checked and compared between monoculture and coculture with hBMSC. Downstream targets of WNT pathway (cMyc, CD44, Met, TCF1/TCF7) were studied by in monoculture. Results: Suppression of leukemic cells by KYA1797K was evident starting from the concentration of 5 microM. Betacatenin was downregulated in all cell lines by KYA1797K. PanRAS was downregulated in MOLT4 and THP1. All the downstream targets evaluated were downregulated by KYA1797K in MOLT4 monoculture which was evident at the concentration of 5microM. Coculture of MOLT4 with hBMSC showed similar pattern with monoculture for betacatenin and PanRAS. PanRAS of hBMSC was not affected. Conclusions: This preclinical study suggest that KYA1797K may be an option for patients with acute leukemia especially who experience relapse. KYA1797K effectively destabilized betacatenin and RAS in acute leukemia. Difference in effective concentration may mean the need of further study in each leukemia cell line. The effect of KYA1797K on leukemiaMSC crosstalk needs further research. * KYA1797K (Nat Chem Biol 2016, 12:593) kindly provided by KangYell Choi. P-034 In Vivo Effect of InterferonGamma Primed Mesenchymal Stem Cells on the Growth of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Seoul, Republic of Korea; 2Pusan National University College of Medicine, Pediatrics, Busan, Republic of Korea Background/Objectives: Although many studies have been tried to clarify cellular interactions between human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and cancer cells in vitro models, the role of MSCs in the growth of tumor cells in vivo is still not fully understood. In this study, we examined the effect of naive MSCs or interferon (IFN)primed MSCs on the growth of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells in an in vivo model. Design/Methods: We established four distinct stable cell lines expressing firefly luciferase (fLuci) gene by infection of lentivirus in SupT1 and CCRFHSB2 ALL cells. We measured luciferase activity using an IVIS optical imaging technique to determine the effects of MSCs on leukemic mass formation. Results: 105 ALL/fLuci cells together with 106 MSCs were inoculated into NOD/SCID mice by intraperitoneal (IP) injection.Much higher luciferase activity was observed when ALL/fLuci cells were coinjected with MSCs as compared to that when ALL/fLuci cells were inoculated alone. In addition, we coinoculated 105 ALL/fLuci cells with different numbers of MSCs (1:1, 1:5 or 1:10 ratio) into mice. Although the bioluminescent intensity gradually increased in all groups, the mice that were coinjected with 106 MSCs showed higher bioluminescent intensity than those coinjected with lower number of MSC, indicating the possibility that MSCs play an important role in stimulating a leukemic proliferation. To determine the effects of IFN priming on the growth of leukemic cells by MSCs, cells together with IFNprimed MSCs were inoculated into NOD/SCID mice via IP injection. Lower luciferase activity was observed when ALL/fLuci cells were coinjected with IFNprimed MSCs as compared to that when ALL/fLuci cells were coinoculated with naive MSCs. Conclusions: Our results suggest that IFN priming may activate MSC's potential anticancer effects. Further studies are needed to elucidate the precise roles of IFNprimed MSCs on the microenvironment of leukemia cells. P-035 Demographics and Outcome of Philadelphia Chromosome Positive ALL in Pediatric Population in a Resource Constraint Setting - A Single Centre Experience A. Kumar 1, G. Pant1, N. Verma1, B. Gupta1, A. George Medical University, Pediatric Oncology, Lucknow, India Background/Objectives: Children with Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) are considered to have a poor prognosis with high risk features. This study was conducted to evaluate the frequency, demographics and outcome of induction chemotherapy in such patients in a resource constraint setting. Design/Methods: Among children with ALL registered from January 2014 to June 2016, in whom flowcytometry and translocations could be done, the demographic data of Ph+ patients were compared with Ph patients. The outcome of Ph+ patients was compared with Ph B and T cell ALL on similar high risk treatment protocols). Ph+ patients additionally received imatinib mesylate as soon as diagnosis was confirmed. Statistical analysis was done by Fischer exact test and outcome by Kaplan Meyer curves for survival analysis. Results: Of 207 patients with ALL, 15(7.28%) were Ph+. No difference was demonstrated between age and sex in Ph+ and Ph ALL (median age 6 years in both and males 73.3% and 74% respectively). Median TLC at presentation was significantly higher in Ph+ as compared to Phnegative patients (2,16,000/mm3 vs 21,000/ mm3 respectively, p<0.0001). A proportion of Ph+ patients 4/15 (26.6%) had CNS leukemia as compared (0.76%) Phnegative patients (p = <0.0004). Though induction deaths were higher 6/15 (40%) in Ph+ patients as compared with Ph high risk patients 10/63(15.8%) this did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.069, OR=3.533 (1.028 to 73.3% Ph+ as compared to 100% of Ph high risk patients. Conclusions: Children with Ph+ ALL (7.28%), had significantly higher TLC and CNS disease at presentation as compared to Ph ALL patients. Induction deaths and failure to reach remission after induction was higher in Ph+ ALL as compared to Ph high risk ALL, despite similar treatment protocol and addition of Imatinib mesylate. P-036 CD44 Expression in T Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia and ITS Association with RAS and NOTCH1 Pathways L.V.C. Marques 1, E. P. Noronha1, F. murine Tcell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (TALL) models, CD44 expression was associated with organ infiltration and influencing survival. CD44 was also identified as a direct NOTCH1 transcriptional target, as well as a target of the RAS pathway, which promotes its alternative splicing, throughout a positive feedback loop. We have investigated whether the cellular expression of CD44 in different maturational subtypes of pediatric TALL could predict RAS and NOTCH1 mutations. Design/Methods: We tested a series of 140 patients with childhood leukemia, being 110 TALL and 30 Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with less than 18 years of age; evaluated for the immunophenotypic profile by multiparameter flow cytometry and used Sanger sequencing to detect mutation in codons 12 and 13 of N/KRAS, 9 and 10 of FBXW7 and 26, 27 and 34 of NOTCH1. CD44 expression was evaluated by median fluorescence intensity (MFI) in leukemic blast cells of patients and 75th percentile MFI value was used as a cutoff between high or low CD44 expression TALL. Results: There was no association between high expression of CD44 and organomegaly in TALL; and between the expression of CD44 among TALL subtypes. AML cases have a higher expression of CD44 (MFI:18890[101944720]) than TALL (MFI:1211[688325]) (p<0.0001). There was no significant difference in CD44 expression between NOTCH1/FBXW7 mut cases (MFI:2689[19419150]) and NOTCH1/FBXW7 Wild Type (WT) cases (MFI:1179[685544]) in TALL, whereas in AML, N/KRAS mut had a lower WT cases (MFI:21720[101944720]) (p=0.032). cellular status was not relevant for TALL tumoral profile and its expression was not associated with TALL subtype. CD44 is under expressed in TALL when compared with AML. N/KRAS and NOTCH1/FBXW7 mutations do not seem be associated with different expression of CD44 in pediatric TALL and AML. P-037 Dyslipidemia and Glucose Metabolism at Time of Diagnosis in Children with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia P. Mogensen 1 1University hospital of Copenhagen, Dept. of Metabolism and Diabetes & Dept. Pediatric Oncology Research, Copehagen \u00d8, Denmark Background / Objectives: Background: Survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have a threefold risk of developing type 2 diabetes, probably caused by intensive chemotherapy including corticosteroids. However, it is unknown if the ALL per se contributes to early dysmetabolic manifestations. This study undertook to determine the glycemic and lipid profiles at time of ALL diagnosis before the onset of ALL therapy. Design / Methods: Material and methods: All patients (Median age 4 years (range 117 years) 70 males) were diagnosed with ALL at University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Denmark since 2008. 122 fasting blood samples were collected at time of diagnosis before onset of therapy. Lipid analyses were performed retrospectively on blood samples collected since 2008. HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose and fasting plasma insulin were measured prospectively in a subgroup (N=24). Insulin resistance was calculated by the HOMAIR based on fasting glucose and insulin. Results: Preliminary Results: Preliminary data at baseline showed median (25th75th quartiles) values of BMI mmol/L (0.66.7) and a triglyceride/HDLratio at 6.8. Median fasting glucose and insulin were 4.9pmol/L (4.45.3) and 24 mmol/L (946) and HbA1c Insulin resistance was 0.84 (0.201.55). Conclusions: ALL seems to influence metabolic parameters including the lipid profile before start of antileukaemic therapy. Currently, correlation analysis is ongoing in order to understand the mechanisms behind these findings. P-038 Survival Analysis of Pediatric Patients with Acute Leukemia and Down Syndrome at the Instituto Nacional De Enfermedades Neoplasicas Lima, Peru Background/Objectives: Children with Down syndrome (DS) have an increased risk of developing acute leukemia than children without this syndrome. Usually, this type of patients develop more chemotherapyrelated toxicity, severe infectious and toxic deaths. The aim of the study is to examine the overall survival (OS) and the diseasefree survival (DFS) at 5 years of children with DS and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Design/Methods: From January 2000 to December 2016, 45 infants and children younger than 14 years with DS who was diagnosed and treated as ALL at the Instituto Nacional de enfermedades Neopl\u00e1sicas (INEN) were retrospectively reviewed. Medical charts were evaluated for socio demographical, clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes. All descriptive data, OS and DFS was analyzed using Stata 14.0 statistical software. We estimated survival rates with the KaplanMeier method and analyzed the results with logrank test and Cox proportional hazard model. Results: With a median follow up time of 50.4 months (range, 1192), 5year OS and DFS were 38.4% (Standard error, SE 9.4%) and 27.2 (SE 7.8%), respectively. In univariate analysis, younger age (<3 years) and risk group were significantly associated with lower OS and DFS rates. The multivariate analysis showed that younger age was an independent predicting factor for both OS (HR=12.0, p=0.003) and DFS (HR=7.8, p=0.004). Highrisk group in terms of DFS (HR=2.5, p=0.007) Conclusions: In this study, younger age and highrisk ALL children with DS had poor treatment outcomes. Efforts are needed to improve survival in these patients. P-039 Epidemiology of Cancers in Infancy S. Mudaliar 1, A. Swami1, B. Agarwal1 1B J Wadia Hospital, Pediatric HematoOncology, Mumbai, India Background/Objectives: Incidence and histological distribution of malignancies in Infants are much different than older children. This study was done to establish the incidence and types of malignancies in infants referred in tertiary care centre and to report changes observed over the last three decades. Design/Methods: Data retrieved from referral records maintained in Oncology Department (for 19852015) was analysed and compared to assess incidences and types of malignancies presenting in infants. Results: During the period, a total of 2,307 children were referred. Of them 285 (12%) were infants including 28 (1.2%) Neonates. The sample had 175 male and 110 female (1.5:1). Neuroblastoma, Sacrococcygeal Teratoma, Hepatoblastoma, Wilm tumor and leukaemia were 5 major referrals. In span of 10 years, the representation was - 1. Percentage of Infant: 61/553 (11%) in first, 108/806 (13.3%) in second and 116 /955 (12.1%) in commonest referrals in the three decades. 3. Ratio of solid to leukaemias was 3:1, 2.6:1 and 1.2:1 respectively in the three decades. Other referred were hemangioendothelioma, fibrosarcoma, hamartoma, infantile malignancies in infants like CML and pancreatoblastoma, 1 case each were diagnosed during 19962005; adrenocortical cancer and ovarian granulose cell tumor during 20062015. Conclusions: Over the three decades, there has been progressive increase in the number of cases referred for malignancies in children. The proportion of infants to childhood and adolescents malignancies remained same in last 3 decades. Embryonal tumors like neuroblastoma, nephroblastoma, retinoblastoma, hepatoblastoma were more prevalent in infancy. Their early onset and predominantly embryonal nature suggest prenatal origin and possibilities of genetic factors. In last two decades, incidence of leukaemias showed increase in infancy as compared to solid tumours (may be due to increased awareness/early referral). P-040 ClinicoEpidemiological Profile and Outcome Predicted by Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) in Children with Mixed Phenotype Acute Leukemia (MPAL) H.H. 1, Memorial Centre, Pediatric Oncology, Mumbai, India; 2Tata Memorial Centre, Pathology, Mumbai, India Background/Objectives: Mixed Phenotype Acute Leukemia (MPAL) accounts for 3-5% of acute leukemia of all age groups and has poor prognosis with currently available treatment modalities. Our study evaluated the clinicoepidemiological profile and outcome of this rare subset of Pediatric leukemia. Design/Methods: Records of the children with acute leukemia from Jan2010 to Dec2016 were reviewed by 2008 WHO criteria for MPAL. Patients were treated uniformly by modified MCP841 protocol, which included highdose cytarabine 24gm/m2 in below 3years age, 16gm/m2 and cranial radiation for 3 or moreyears age. Data collected was subjected to descriptive analysis tools. Results: Among 3,830 children with acute leukemia, 26(0.68%) had MPAL. Median age at diagnosis was 9 years (range:214) with M:F ratio 2.3:1. Median WBC was 13.4\u00d7109/L in 22 cases (median 433U/L, range:1734880), while 23% had bulky disease. B/Myeloid was the and 1BCR/ABL, 1MLL rearrangement, 1Monosomy 7 and 1hypodiploidy). Nineteen patients were evaluated for outcome, as 5 were treated elsewhere, 1 refused treatment and 1 opted for oral palliative chemotherapy. Seventeen underwent postinduction bone marrow of which 14(82%) achieved morphological remission. Fourteen patients had postinduction MRD status available, 5 were negative, and of the remaining, another 5 became negative postconsolidation. Remarkably, 80% of 10 MRDnegative cases were in sustained remission at last followup. None underwent bone marrow transplant. Projected threeyear overall survival was 45% and progression free survival was 40% with median followup of 22 months (range:449). Conclusions: MPAL represented less than 1% of childhood acute leukemia with B/Myeloid being the commonest. Outcome remains poor without transplant for relapse/refractory disease. ALLtype chemotherapy incorporating highdose cytarabine block was effective in achieving MRDnegativity defined response rate of 71% in evaluated patients, which correlated with better outcome. P-041 A Rare Demon: Dengue Fever in Febrile Neutropenia of Pediatric Malignancy M. 1, P. Ankit1, Purva1, C. Shraddha1, Wadia India Background/Objectives: Febrile neutropenia (FN) is a pediatric oncological emergency where most common organisms are bacteria and fungus, very rarely a virus. In tropical country like India particularly in rainy season lethal dengue virus can be a common organism complicating FN. As management of Dengue Fever (DF) with FN is different from conventional management, early diagnosis is warranted. Clinical profile and outcome of patients with FN with DF in pediatric malignancies at a tertiary care center is analyzed. Design/Methods: All cases of FN in children with leukemia admitted in a tertiary care center between August 2016 till December 2016 were analyzed. Diagnosis DF or Severe DF with FN was based on WHO guidelines. Clinical profile and outcome of patients analyzed. Results: Of 80 patients with FN in unit, 23 had DF or Severe DF. Fever was present in all with febrile seizure in one patient. Typical rash was present in 21%, with third space fluid accumulation in 8% of patients. Average duration of hospital stay was 3.5 days more as compared to other FN patients. Two patients required PICU stay for ionotrope support. All recovered with no mortality. Thrombocytopenia was present in 14 patients with a mean platelet count of 56,000. Abnormal liver function was seen 21%. Dengue NS1 Ag was positive in all with a mean duration of diagnosis of 2.6 days. Dengue IgM ELISA was positive in 30% of patients. Conclusions: Early diagnosis of DF in FN is important as treatment focuses more on fluid resuscitation and monitoring rather than on antibiotics. It reduces the mean duration of hospital stay. Hence, high index of suspicion of DF is required in FN patients to avoid life threatening complications. Strategies by WHO for prevention of mosquito bite needs to be implemented to reduce morbidity associated with DF in children with FN in endemic areas P-042 Detection of Minimal Residual Disease in Children with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treated According to the ALL ICBFM2002 and ALL ICBFM 2009 Protocols K. PawiskaWsikowska 1, K. BukowskaStrakova2, M. Surman2, W. Balwierz1 1Institute of Pediatrics Jagiellonian University College, Department of Oncology and Hematology, KRAKOW, Poland; 2Institute of Pediatrics Jagiellonian University Medical College, Department of Clinical Immunology and Transplantology, KRAKOW, Poland Background/Objectives: Monitoring of minimal residual disease (MRD) during the induction treatment is currently recognized the most important prognostic factor in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Achievement of MRD below 0.1% on day 15 of induction assessed by multicolor flow cytometry (MFC) is an powerful predictor of survival in ALL patients. Assessment of MRD in other time points can be also crucial, however identification of low amounts residual cells is usually disturbed by excessive regeneration of bone marrow, or by its hypoplasia. The main goal of the study was to verify usefulness of monoclonal antibodies' panel applied in ALL ICBFM studies, by 4 and 6 and 10color flow cytometry to define aberrant phenotypic profiles in ALL blasts. Design/Methods: In this prospective study, we used 4color flow cytometry since 2007 to 2009 and 6 -color since 2010 to 2015, and 10color flow cytometry since 2016 to detect MRD. Two hundred forty one children with ALL (200 common/preBALL, 9 proBALL, 32 TALL; 140 boys, 101 girls) treated according to ALL ICBFM protocols 2002 and 2009: 137 and 104 patients, respectively, were enrolled in this study. Analysis of MRD was performed at day 0 and day 15 and 33 induction of chemotherapy, before consolidation (day 78), as well at the end of therapy. Sensitivity of detection at all time points was at least 1/10 000 cells. Results: In patients with common/preBALL (CD20/CD10/CD34/CD19) and (CD58/CD34/CD45/CD10/CD19/CD20) were most suitable for assessment of leukemic blasts, suggesting that these are the most efficient for MRD detection. Two weeks after ending maintenance chemotherapy is the optimal time for reliable assessment of MRD. Conclusions: Our results shows that even limited panel of antibodies used in the study allows defining leukemic phenotypes and monitoring levels of MRD at set time points despite of changes in expression of antigens during the treatment. P-043 Role of Endocannabinoid/Endovanilloid System in TCELL LLA F. Punzo 1, C. Tortora2, E. Pota1, I. V. Vanvitelli\", Italy; 2Universit\u00e0 degli Studi della Pharmacology, Napoli, Italy Background/Objectives: The Endocannabinoid/Endovanilloid (EC/EV) system has been proposed as possible target to treat several malignancies, including lymphoblastic diseases. The EC/EV system is composed of two GProtein Coupled Receptors (CB1 and CB2), the Transient Potential Vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channel, their endogenous and exogenous ligands and enzymes. CB1 is expressed mainly in central nervous system while CB2 predominantly on immune and peripheral cells. We investigated the role of the EC/EV system in TCell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (TCell ALL). Design/Methods: We cultured primary lymphoblasts from 7 children with TCell ALL and Jurkatt cell line, and treated them with a selective CB2 agonist (JWH133) and a TRPV1 agonist (RTX). We (100nM, 1uM, 5uM) and RTX (2,5uM and 5uM), and 24 hours, performing a citofluorimetric Annexin V Assay and we evaluated the expression level of 2 target genes (Caspase 3 and p53) by RealTime PCR and Western Blotting. Results: We observed a doseresponse effect after JWH133 treatment, while stimulating the Vanilloid receptors caused a nondose dependent increase in apoptosis. The effect is more striking at 6 hours after treatment and it decreases with time. Moreover Caspase3 and p53 mRNA and protein levels where increased 12 hours after exposure to JWH133 at the concentration of 100nM, both in primary lymphoblast cell cultures as in Jurkatt cell line. Conclusions: In conclusion we observed a proapoptotic effect induced by EC/EV compounds, by upregulating 2 target genes (Caspase3 and p53) both in primary lymphoblasts obtained from patients with TCell ALL and in Jurkatt cell line. Our results show that both CB2 stimulation and TRPV1 activation, can increase the Apoptosis in vitro, indicating that a new therapeutic approach to Tcell ALL might be possible by modulating the Endocannabinoid/Endovanilloid system. P-044 Monosomy/Total Loss of Chromosome 7 in Pediatric Acute Leukemia: Report from a Single Institution in Argentina C.D. Quispe 1, E. Baialardo2, M. Guitter1, J. Rossi3, Alfaro1, P. Zubizzareta1, M. 1Hospital acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplasia. However, they are not usually detected in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Monosomy/total losschrosome7 has been associated with adverse outcome in AML and its prognostic significance in ALL is not clearly defined. 1To analyze clinical/biological characteristics and outcome of patients with monosomy/losschromosome7. 2To compare prognostic value in to 447 AML and 1531 ALL were admitted. Monosomy/losschromosome7 was detected in 21 (4.5%) AML and 26 (1.7%) ALL patients. We evaluated clinical/biological features and outcome. The pEFS was estimated by KaplanMeier and compared with logranktest. Results: No differences were observed in age and WBC count when comparing AML vs. ALL. Monosomy/losschromosome7 as unique abnormality was detected in 11 AML and 3 ALL cases. We divided ALL with losschromosome7 in 2 groups: <45 (n=15) or >45 chromosomes remission (CR) was achieved in 14/21 (66%) AML cases, 3 died early and 4 presented null response. Of the 14 who achieved CR, 8 relapsed, 3 died in CR and 3 remain in CR. Regarding ALL, 23 (88%) achieved CR, 2 died early and 1 patient presented null response. Of the 23 patients who achieved CR, 3 relapsed, 2 died in CR and 18 remain in CR. The pEFS for AML with monosomy/losschromosome7 was 12(10)% vs. 50(3)% for cases with losschromosome7, pEFS(SE) was 61(11)% 70(1)% for ALL without this abnormality (p=0.3925). The pEFS(SE) for ALL patients with monosomy7 alone was 33(27)%. If we compare cases <45 chromosomes vs. >45 was 38(15)% and 100% (p=0.0067). Conclusions: Monosomy/losschromosome7 conferred significant inferior outcome to AML patients. In ALL, monosomy7 did not influence survival probabilities. However, ALL patients with monosomy7 and nonhypodiploid achieved a significant better survival rates than hypodiploid plus losschromosome7 cases. P-045 Cytomegalovirus Retinitis in Children with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia During Maintenance Phase Chemotherapy A.A. Rahman 1, 3Bangabandhu dermatology, Dhaka, Bangladesh Background/Objectives: Viral infections are an under recognized problem in children on standard chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised individuals. But data regarding the incidence and manifestations of CMV disease in pediatric ALL patients are scanty. Cytomegalovirus retinitis (CMVR) is rarely reported in children with ALL who did not receive hematopoietic stem cell transplantations (HSCT) and quite rare during maintenance phase therapy. Herein, we report cases of bilateral cytomegalovirus retinitis in children with ALL during maintenance phase therapy; highlighting the importance of eye examination and care in patients diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Design/Methods: During the period from January to December' 2016, we found three cases of CMV retinitis in children with ALL at our department who were referred to ophthalmologist for reduced vision. CMVR was diagnosed by the presence of characteristic lesion on fundoscopy in immunocompromised state as confirmed by ophthalmologist and positive CMV DNA in blood sample. Results: We identified total three male children of CMVR during one year period with age range 3.8 to 6 yr. The underlying causes of immunocompromise were chemotherapy for leukemia ; identified as having CMVR during maintenance phase therapy. All the three children were neutropenic for a period of days to months before ; were getting treatment for febrile neutropenia. Cytomegalovirus retinitis was bilateral in all three children. Discontinuation of immunosuppressive medications and administration of anticytomegalovirus drugs led to regression of active retinitis . later 2/3 children died within 1 to 5 months of being diagnosed with cytomegalovirus retinitis. The remaining one child is alive, with improvement of vision. Conclusions: The present cases suggests that pediatric patients with ALL in the maintenance phase may be immunosuppressed and immediate ophthalmologic examination and CMV testing is warranted in cases with disturbances of visual acuity. P-046 Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia; Are We Missing Early Diagnosis In Children? J. Ranasinghe 1, W. Rathnayaka2, Paediatrics, Lanka; 2National Cancer Institute, Pediatric Clinical Oncology, Maharagama, Sri Lanka Background/Objectives: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood malignancy accounting for onefourths of all childhood cancers and threefourths of all newly diagnosed patients with acute leukemia. The incidence varied from 03 to 04 / 100,000 children with a male predominance. The objective was to evaluate the presenting features and time duration to diagnose ALL in children presenting to National Cancer Institute (NCI), Sri Lanka. Design/Methods: This retrospective cross sectional study was carried out at Paediatric unitA of NCI. All patients were less than 15 years and confirmed with ALL. Data was collected using an interviewer administered questionnaire and from health records. Results: A total of 85 children included with 58 (68.2%) were males. Age ranged from 08 months to 11 years. Majority (n=66,77.6%) were \"B\"immunophenotype. CD 10 surface antigen was detected in 31 (36%) and in 33 (38.8%) none were detected. Others were CD 05(n=01), 13(n=03), 19(n=01), 20(n=02) & 117(n=01). Only 39 patients (47.6%) were diagnosed within first 14 days. Three patients took 4 months. The longest time taken was 15 months who have had steroid treatments frequently. The most common symptom was \"intermittent fever\" complained by 52 patients (67%). Other common symptoms were neck lump (n=14,16%), joint pain (n=11,13%), myalgia (n=7,8%), loss of appetite (n=05,05.8%), (n=05,05.8%), respiratory infection (n=04,04.7%), rash (n=04,04.7%), acute gastroenteritis, abdominal mass, ecchymosis, limping, investigated for anaemia, headache, generalized lymphadenopathy and chest pain etc. Only 13 patients had white cell count <04.0x103/ml3 and 43%(n=36) had leucocytosis. Only thrombocytosis and 72%(n=54) had haemoglobin <10g/dl. However these findings were not statistically significant. Conclusions: Only 39(47.6%) patients were diagnosed within the first 14 days. The most common symptom was \"intermittent fever\" and this was the complaint in 52 (67%) patients. P-047 Effects of Ubiquitin Ligase HUWE1 on Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, Brazil Background/Objectives: Acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood malignancy. Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) is present in 5% of childhood cases. Ph positive leukemias express the tyrosine kinase BCRABL, that is responsible for constitutive activation of RAS pathway and mediates leukemic cells proliferation. Even with high cure rates, a lot of patients develop resistance to treatment and relapse. Previously published data suggests association between hyperactivation of RAS pathway and favorable treatment outcome, pointing to a new research approach. HUWE1 participates in negative feedback mechanism controlling Shoc2 activity in activation of ERK1/2. Thus, it can be assumed that loss of HUWE1 would lead to increased activation of ERK1/2 and, therefore, hyperactivation of RAS pathway. Objectives: To evaluate the impact of HUWE1 knockdown in leukemic cell lines. Design/Methods: ALL, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines were transduced with miRE lentiviral particles for gene knockdown. Flow cytometry, apoptosis assay were cells showed Nalm6, THP1, but not HL60. Nalm6 with significant upregulation (P<0.05), however, pERK1/2 increase was not seen. K562 showed no changes in apoptosis or p21 expression despite the increase in pERK1/2. Regarding AML cells, THP1 showed increase in pERK1/2 and p21 expression (P<0.05). Besides having no disadvantage in growth, HL60 showed downregulation of p21 when pERK1/2 was increased, suggesting that hyperactivation of RAS pathway might have protective effect on them. This opposite behavior between THP1 and HL60 reveals an interesting path involving HUWE1 because these cell lines have opposite metabolic patterns: THP1 on oxidative phosphorylation while cells. Conclusions: These results suggest that HUWE1 might play a role in metabolic imbalances in leukemic cells. Further studies are necessary to investigate this correlation. Financial Support: FAPESP (Process 2015/121465) P-048 Detection of IKZF1 Deletions by a Very Simplified and LowCost Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RTPCR) Technique and ITS Impact on Childhood All Paulo, Pediatrics, Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, Brazil Background/Objectives: IKZF1 gene deletion has been associated with worse prognosis in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Its detection has been made by laborious and expensive techniques, making it difficult to perform at most treatment centers, especially in developing countries. This study analyzed the presence of deletions of the IKZF1 gene in children with ALL by a very simplified and lowcost RTPCR technique and evaluated its association with prognosis Design/Methods: It were analyzed 48 consecutive BM samples obtained from children with ALL (41 preB and 7 TALL) treated according to the Brazilian Treatment Protocol, with a median followup of 120 months. The same cDNA used to the routine translocation studies were amplified by RTPCR using only a pair of primers that flanks the exons 1 to 8 of the IKZF1 gene. The product obtained was electrophoresed in 2% agarose gel. Association between IKZF1 deletion and eventfree survival (EFS) was assessed by Kaplan Meier curves and multivariate analysis by Cox Regression Model Results: Deletion in theIKZF1 gene was observed in 6/41 (14.6%) samples of Bderived ALL and in none of the TALL. Ten years EFS was 70.1 \u00b1 7.3% versus 16.7 \u00b1 15.2 (P = 0.017), for the groups with and without IKZF1 deletion respectively, with a relative risk of unfavorable event of 3.27 (95% CI: 1.159.32) for the presence of the deletion. Multivariate analysis showed that IKZF1 deletion was an independent prognostic factor (P = 0.028) when analyzed in association with age and number of WBC at diagnosis Conclusions: The present study suggests that the use of a simplified and low cost IKZF1 deletion analysis technique is capable of detecting patients at higher risk of relapse and may be useful in the stratification of patients with B lineage ALL in future treatment protocols. Larger multicentric studies are necessary to confirm these Results: P-049 Angiogenesis in Children with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Based Serum VEGF Concentration Assay G. SobolMilejska 1, A. MiziaMalarz1, K. Musio1 1Medical University of Silesia Upper Silesia Centre for Child's Health, Department of OncologyHematology and Chemotherapy, Katowice, Poland Background/Objectives: Angiogenesis is a process essential for growth and development of all human tissues. VEGF has a key role in angiogenesis stimulation.The purpose of the study was to assess angiogenesis in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) based on serum VEGF level determined at diagnosis and at remission (day 33 ), with further subject subdivision into different risk groups Design/Methods: Forty children, aged 312 y, with newly diagnosed ALL, treated according to the ALLIC 2002 protocol were enrolled in the study. They were classified to 3 groups: SRG18pts, IRG VEGF serum concentration was determined at diagnosis and on day 33. of treatment. Results: At baseline, serum levels of VEGF were determined in the entire study group and healthy controls. The median of VEGF serum level of 185.2 pg/mL (22.3684.4) in study patients was comparable to the one of controls (144.6 pg/mL; 32.7237.9). was comparable to the one of controls (144.6 pg/mL; 32.7237.9). The median values of serum VEGF at diagnosis were comparable between the SRG and the control groups, and significantly higher in IRG and HRG as compared to the control group. At remission the median of serum VEGF level was significantly higher in all study groups, as compared to the controls. The median of serum VEGF levels in group SRG was significantly higher at remission. The median values of serum VEGF on day 33 were higher in groups IRG and HRG without statistical signification. Conclusions: The significant higher level of serum VEGF in children with ALL in comparison with healthy control, both at the diagnosis and in the remission, could suggest the intensification of angiogenesis in the bone marrow, at diagnosis. There is a tendency for higher serum VEGF level in the groups with less satisfying prognosis,which suggests the needs of further studies. P-050 Thrombosis in Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia D. Sosothikul 1, K. Chiengthong1, P. Techavichit1, P. Seksarn1 1Chulalongkorn University King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Department of Pediatrics, bangkok, Thailand Background/Objectives: Thromboembolism is a serious complication associated with morbidity in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The risk of thrombotic complication in childhood ALL ranges widely from 137% worldwide.To study prevalence and risk factor of thrombosis in childhood ALL. Design/Methods: A retrospective descriptive study in patients with thrombosis in children diagnosed as ALL at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital,Thailand from 2005 to 2016. Results: The prevalence of thrombosis in 220 cases of childhood ALL was 5.5 %. Twelve patients were diagnosed with thromboembolism (4 males and 8 females). Age ranged from 4 to 14 years (median 9.7 years). Most thromboembolism events occurred during the induction phase of chemotherapy (83%). Patients with high risk and very high risk ALL were likely to develop thromboembolism event (67%). Clinical manifestation of thrombosis events was cerebral thrombosis (67%) followed by deep vein thrombosis (33%). The risk factors of thrombotic event were the administration of asparaginase (58%) followed by the indwelling of central line (33%). Older children more than age 10 years were at higher risk for developing cerebral thrombosis. Management of thrombotic events was lowmolecularweight heparin at 1 mg/kg/dose twice a day for 13 months then switched to warfarin until the risk factors were resolved. Doppler ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging were the methods used in thrombosis detection and follow up for resolving. Median time for resolving cerebral thrombosis and deep vein thrombosis was 5.6 and 3.2 months, respectively. Transfusion of fresh frozen plasma before starting asparaginase treatment is currently recommended for preventing recurrent thrombotic events. Conclusions: The prevalence of thrombosis in childhood ALL is quite high especially in older children and does interfere with the treatment plan. Thrombosis among childhood ALL is often observed in patients receiving asparaginase and central line insertion. Preventive strategies in this group of patients should be considered. P-051 Circulating Endothelial Cells and Metabolic Status in Childhood Cancer Survivors E. Athanasopoulos1, G. Martimianaki1, Kampouraki1, Hospital of Pediatric Heraklion Crete, Greece Background/Objectives: Circulating Endothelial Progenitor Cells (CEPCs) play a significant role in the maintenance of vascular integrity, balancing the anticoagulation mechanisms and regulating the leukocyte trafficking. Additionally, it is wellestablished, that patients who underwent chemotherapy have increased incidence of hypertension and obesity. Nevertheless, numerous studies have shown a negative correlation between CEPCs and obesity, underlining poor vascular repair. Objective:The study of CEPCs in childhood survivors of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) and solid tumors (ST) and the investigation of their levels in correlation with patients Body Mass Index (BMI) and blood pressure (BP). Design/Methods: Four colour flow cytometry was performed to determine the subpopulations CD34+CD45negdimCD133+, CD34+CD45negdimVEGFR2+ and CD34+CD45negdimCD133+VEGFR2+ of CEPCs in the peripheral blood from children with ALL(n=104), ST(n=97) and children without malignancies as control group(n=125).The BMI and BP of the patients were calculated and the percentiles were established specific by the age and gender. Results: Patients characteristics.

This article is being made freely available through PubMed Central as part of the COVID-19 public health emergency response. It can be used for unrestricted research re-use and analysis in any form or by any means with acknowledgement of the original source, for the duration of the public health emergency. The levels of CEPCs in ALL did not show any significant difference between the time post treatment. In solid tumors the levels of CEPCs during the 1st year posttreatment are significantly higher than those in the following years. The correlation between BMI and CEPCs in ALL and ST group, showed statistically significant difference between overweight/Obese survivors. The study of BP status in ALL and ST have no significant difference. Conclusions: The levels of CEPCs are increased during the 1st year after treatment of solid tumors, finding that needs further investigation in relation with metabolic factors in childhood cancer survivors. P-052 Presence of Minimal Residual Disease Detected by Flow Cytometry is a Predictor of Early Relapse in Patients with T Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia P. Subramanian 1, P. Tembhare1, G. Chaterjee1, Laboratory, India; 2Tata Memorial Centre, Medical Oncology, Mumbai, India Background/Objectives: We investigated the value of assessment of postinduction minimal residual disease (MRD) in bone marrow by flow cytometry (FC) in childhood T cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (TALL).There are a few studies on the relevance of Minimal residual disease (MRD) evaluation in (TALL). AIEOPBFM group showed that late (Day78) MRD response determines overall riskofrelapse and eventfreesurvival (EFS) using RQPCR. A larger study by COG (Brent Wood et al. ASH, 2014) showed that postinduction (Day29) FCMRD was more relevant in prediction of EFS. Design/Methods: We studied postinduction (Day35) MRD (PIMRD) in bone marrow samples from 100 children under the age of 16 years with TALL treated using modified MCP841 protocol between 2014 & 2016. In TALL with earlyT cellprecursor (ETPALL) immunophenotype, patients received Dexamethasone using 10color FCMRD assay on Navios cytometer and with Kaluza software v1.3 (Beckman Coulter). Results: Median age of patients was 11.5 years (range 2-15 y; M:F-4.6). Initial immunophenotype was positive in median level of 0.23% (range, 0.002%6%). PIMRD positivity was significantly high nonETPALL (93% vs 53%; p=0.01). Median followup of all patients was 13.2 months (338 months). Patients were categorised MRD negative (MRDN) if PIMRD was negative and MRD positive (MRDP) if PIMRD was positive with any level. Thus, 42% were categorized as MRDN & 58% as MRDP. Twenty patients relapsed & of them six died (2 were ETPALL & 18 nonETPALL; 3 MRDN & 17 MRDP) within 26 months. Median EFS of MRDP patients was significantly inferior as compared to MRDN (26 months vs. did not reach; & 70.67% p=0.0017). Conclusions: We conclude FCMRD positivity is predictor of early relapse in childhood TALL. P-053 Monocytic Lineage Switch in BCellPrecursor Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in Children - Temporary Escape or Mechanism of Chemotherapy Resistance? M. Twardoch1, A. Sonsala1, L. Sedek2, J. Kowalczyk15, T. Szczepaski 1 1Medical University of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Zabrze, Poland; 2Medical University Microbiology and Immunology, Zabrze, Poland; 3Medical University of Warsaw, Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Warsaw, Poland; 4Medical University Lodz, and Diabetology, Lodz, Poland; 5Medical University Wroclaw, Pediatric and Oncology, Wroclaw, Poland; 6University of Oncology, Lublin, Poland Background/Objectives: In a small proportion of childhood Bcellprecursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCPALL), the leukemic blasts switch their immunophenotype towards monocytic lineage (swBCPALL). The aim of the study was to determine the frequency and immunophenotypic features of patients with swBCPALL in Poland. Design/Methods: The study group comprised 940 pediatric patients with BCPALL, aged 018 years (median 4.6 years) treated according to the ALLICBFM 2009 protocol in 14 Polish hematooncology centers between 2012 and 2017. Bone marrow or peripheral blood samples were stained at diagnosis and during follow up with 7 and 8color monoclonal antibody panels. Data were analyzed using Infinicyt software (Cytognos SL, Spain) and FACSDiva (BD Bioscience, USA). Results: The monocytic lineage switch induction treatment was observed in 29/940 (3.1%) BCPALL patients and was usually associated with high expression of CD34 (27/29 cases), weak or partial expression of CD10 (24/29 cases) and expression of CD2 (11/13 cases) at diagnosis. In all patients with detectable aberrant monocytoid cells during follow up, weak expression of CD19 and CD34 was found. The expression of CD10 and CD22 in most patients with swBCPALL was decreased in comparison to diagnosis. Furthermore, at least partial expression of CD2, CD14, CD13 and CD33 was detected on residual blasts in most patients with swBCPALL. In addition, in all swBCPALL patients expression of CD2 observed at diagnosis was maintained during treatment. Finally, the MRD levels at day 15 were significantly higher in swBCPALL patients compared with the remaining BCPALL patients with positive rare subset of BCPALL cases detected mainly during induction treatment. Significantly higher MRD levels at day 15 suggest slower response to induction treatment in swBCPALL patients. Further investigation and follow up is needed to determine, if the monocytic lineage switch has significant clinical value. P-054 Minimal Residual Disease and ETV6RUNX1 Predicts Improved Outcomes of Hypodiploid Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL): A Single Centre Experience of 254 Children S. Tandon 1, G. Narula1, M. Prasad1, B. Arora1, Centre, cytogenetics, Mumbai, India Background/Objectives: Hypodiploidy constitutes 5 % of ALL with poorer prognosis on currently available therapy. Our study evaluated clinicoepidemiological profile, outcomes, cytogenetic, MRD correlation of this subset of paediatric ALL. Design/Methods: Data of all children with ALL having hypodiploidy on conventional cytogenetics from Jan2008Nov2016 was retrospectively analyzed from electronic medical records and patient charts. Children were treated on different institutional protocols before and after Feb2013. Principal differences were use of highdose cytarabine and cranial radiation in the earlier era, and routine use of MRD and highdose methotrexate in the latter. Results: B ALL was diagnosed in 3208 children during the study period; 254(8%) had hypodiploidy. Median age was 6 years (115), M: F 2.5:1. leukocyte counts were 15.6x109/L(0.3400) NCISR and HR were 116(45.6%) and138(54.3%) respectively. High and low hypodiploidy were seen and 31(12%) achieved remission, 51(23%) did not, 4(7.8%) failed induction. Of 95 children with postinduction MRD, 19(20%) were positive, 15(79%) of which became negative post consolidation. At a median followup of 32 months (184), projected 7year OS and EFS were 65.5% and 50% respectively. CNS status, NCI risk, prednisolone response were not significant. High and low hypodiploidy had better outcomes than near haploidy (p<0.01). ETV6RUNX1 correlated with improved OS and EFS (p<0.01). Postinduction MRDnegativity translated to significantly improved OS and EFS (p<0.01). Veryearly isolated medullary relapse was the commonest failure. Conclusions: remains a highrisk subset of childhood BALL. Postinduction MRDnegativity and ETV6RUNX1 had better survival within this subset, while near haploidy portends poor outcome. P-055 Immunoglobulin Levels in Children on Treatment for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia C. Bajwa1, A. Trehan 1, A. Rawat1, D. Bansal1 1Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education & Research, Pediatrics, Chandigarh, India Background/Objectives: Chemotherapy results in depression of humoral immunity. This predisposes patients to severe infections which may be recurrent and occasionally, life threatening. This study evaluated immunoglobulin levels in children with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). Design/Methods: Observational prospective study performed from June 2015 - October 2016. Children with relapsed disease and a known underlying immunodeficient state were excluded. Immunoglobulin levels (IgG, IgM & IgA) were analyzed at the following time points in each patient: (i) At diagnosis, (ii) end of induction and consolidation therapy, (iii) end of the delayed intensification phase of chemotherapy Results: Thirty five children, mean age: 5.17\u00b1 3.2 years ; 31: B precursor cell ALL ; 4:T cell ALL were evaluated. The immunoglobulin levels at diagnosis were normal for age with IgG being on the upper side of normal. IgM and IgG levels decreased after induction and consolidation therapy. IgM declined to the lower limit of normal for age with 14(40%) children having low IgM levels. IgG did not fall below normal for age. Levels did not fall further after intensification therapy. At no time did IgA levels alter. Forty percent children had 1 episode of FN, 17% had 2 episodes of FN and 7 (20%) had > 3 episodes of FN, whilst 23 children did not have FN. Children with greater episodes of FN did not have lower levels of immunoglobulins. Conclusions: Chemotherapy results in an altered immune profile. IgG and IgM levels both decrease after initiation of chemotherapy with nearly 40% children having low IgM levels at the end of intensive therapy. A larger patient cohort would help delineate severity of fall between the ALL risk groups. Patients need repeat evaluation of their immunoglobulin profile after therapy to look for recovery of immune function. Replacement therapy may deserve recommendation in patients with recurrent episodes of infections. P-056 Childhood Leukemia in an ETV6Related Thrombocytopenia Family S. Unal 1, F. Gumruk1, M. Cetin1, A. Shimamura2 1Hacettepe University School, Division of Pediatric Hematology, ANKARA, Turkey; 2DanaFarber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Bone Marrow Failure and MDS Program, Boston, Turkey Background/Objectives: ETV6related thrombocytopenia is an autosomal dominant thrombocytopenia that has been recently identified in a few families and has been reported to have leukemia predisposition. Normal size, autosomal dominantly inherited thrombocytopenia has been reported in patients with RUNX1, ANKRD26 and ETV6. Design/Methods: A currently 11 yearold boy was referred to our center with a diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at 5 years of age. Results: Previous history revealed a followup period with a diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in the preceeding 2 years. During the past medical history prior to ALL diagnosis, median platelet count was 35x109/L and did not receive any specific treatment for ITP. Family history revealed thrombocytopenia (plt 59 x109/L, MPV 8.1 fl) in father but the etiology was not identified. The hemogram at admission for ALL revealed Hgb 8.6 fl. The bone marrow aspiration revealed diffuse leukemic infiltration with L1 type blasts and immunephenotype was CALLA positive preB cell ALL. Cytogenetics revealed 46, XY karyotype. CNS cytology was negative and St Jude Total XV protocol for ALL was initiated. After cessation of treatment protocol, he still could not achieve a normal paltelet count (plt 47 x109/L). DEB test for Fanconi anemia was negative. Molecular workup revealed ETV6:1358M mutation in both the patient and the father. Conclusions: ETV6related thrombocytopenia should be considered in families with dominant inheritance pattern and patients should be followed for leukemia development. P-057 Evaluation of PCRBased MRD Testing in Children with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treated According to All IC BFM 2009 Protocol: Slovak Experience A. Vask\u00e1 1, Pediatrics, Bratislava, Slovak Republic; 2Comenius University - Medical School and University of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Bratislava, Slovak University of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Prague, Czech Republic; 7Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, CLIP, Prague, Czech Republic Background/Objectives: In the treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) the detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) is a significant determinant of patient outcome. The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of routine PCRbased MRD testing on stratification criteria of the ALLIC BFM 2009 protocol Design/Methods: From 2013 to 2016, 89 patients (agerange 118 years) were enrolled into ALL IC BFM 2009 protocol. The patients were stratified into a standard (SRG), intermediate (IRG) and highrisk group (HRG) according of hypodiploidy, ETV6RUNX1, BCRABL1 andMLLAF4 and the prednisone response. Bone marrow response to induction therapy was assessed primarily by morphology and secondly by flow cytometry on days 15 and 33. PCRbased MRD testing was performed on days 33 and 78 (week 12), before protocol M or first highrisk block, respectively. To the routine PCRbased MRD and survival evaluation 68 patients were included; finally, in 61 patients PCRbased MRD testing was determined. Results: Based on MRD stratification criteria, 13 patients were stratified into the HRG (19.1%), 45 patients to IRG (66.2%) and (14.7%). Threeyear threeyear eventfree 92.5% (N=68; 2 deaths) and 84.6% (N=68; 7 events), respectively. In the study group with determined PCRbased MRD testing on day 33 (N=61), MRD positivity was statistically significantly associated with T precursor type (P=0.002), bone marrow response on day 15 (P=0.048) and with event accuracy (P=0.042). MRD negativity was significantly associated with TEL/AML1 fusion gene (P=0.011). There was no significant association of PCRbased MRD testing on day 78 with any analyzed factor Conclusions: Results showed the prognostic value of PCRbased MRD detection for prediction of events in the study group and also confirmed previous findings treatment impact on the prognosis for children with ALL during induction.

PonceCruz1, (p11; q22) translocation is a rare chromosomal that occurs mainly in Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Myelodysplastic Syndromes and blast crisis of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia. Recently, the karyotype along with this gene has been found in Ewing Sarcoma. It has been observed that in this type of alterations the TLS / FUSERG gene is present. This karyotype represent an unfavorable prognostic sign because of the high resistance to chemotherapy and the high percentage of relapses. Design/Methods: We present the first case of a pediatric patient with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) at relapse with a secondary chromosomal t(16; 21) (p11; q22). Results: A 15 yearold female with ALL L2 type (FAB). Bone marrow showed 96% lymphoblasts. Leukemic CD79a + and CD13 +. Cytogenetic study was performed without showing any alterations. Treatment was given with St. Jude XIII, with favorable evolution until week 76. At that moment, the patient presented pancytopenia hemoglobin 7.6 g per dL, 48,000 platelets per mm3, and leucocyte count of 800 per mm3. Bone marrow showed 97% of lymphoblasts. The immunophenotype Cytogenetics reported t(16; 21) (p11; q22). It was decided to start treatment with NOPHO 93 and ATEDOX with complete remission within the first cycle of chemotherapy. She was presented to the Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) program. Conclusions: Only 4 cases have been reported in pediatric patients with t(16; 21) (p11; q22) and this is the first case report with this abnormality as a secondary finding. This represents a therapeutic challenge and we propose to treat this kind of patient as an Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia and salvage therapy with HSCT. P-059 Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome Treatment Based on Symptoms and Imaging Findings in Pediatric Patients with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia M. Velazquezavina 1, J. Pe\u00f1alozaGonz\u00e1lez1 1Hospital Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is an uncommon side effect of some chemotherapeutic agents, particularly methotrexate. The clinical presentation depends on the area of brain hypoperfusion. To date there is no standardized treatment, but a myriad of drugs and procedures have been proposed. The purpose of this study is to report our experience in the treatment of this syndrome in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Design/Methods: We performed a retrospective record review and included patients with LLA with neurologic focal symptoms two weeks after methotrexate treatment regardless route of administration. The study period was from October 2004 to December 2014. The demographic and clinical characteristics are described as means or proportions according to variable type. Results: We reviewed 176 charts of eligible patients, of which eight (4.5%, 4 female, 4 male) presented PRES. The average age was 11.2 years. Seven patients had highrisk ALL (87.5%) and 1 (12.5%) standard risk ALL. The onset of symptoms started at an average of 7.3 days after intravenous (n=6; 75%), or intrathecal (n=2; 25%) methotrexate. None of the cases had simultaneous routes of administration. Patients with localized ischemia (n=3) were treated citicoline (1020 mg/kg/d) for 57 days, with seizures (n=2) were treated with valproate for 6 months (15 mg/kg/d); and with areas of brain edema were treated with dexametasone (0.5 mg/kg/d) for 5 days. All patients with brain ischemia without seizures (n=3) were treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Five patients had multiple simultaneous therapy according to clinical and imaging characteristics. Symptoms recovery was present at 10 days postreatment average. None of the patients had permanent neurological sequelae. Conclusions: According to our findings, complete recovery of PRES can be achieved if therapy is started early based on symptoms and MRI findings. If no contraindication is present, multiple simultaneous therapy can be safely prescribed. P-060 Outcome of All Induction Chemotherapy in Children Belonging to the Economically Weaker Sections of a LowMiddle Income Country N. Verma 1, A. Kumar2, V. George Medical George's Medical University, Pediatrics, Lucknow, India Background/Objectives: Most of the children suffering from Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) from the Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) are unable to reach apex cancer institutes or corporate hospitals for their treatment. They are either treated in government medical centers or die in absence of optimal treatment. There is a dearth of information on the outcome of induction chemotherapy in this group of children Design/Methods: Data of all children with ALL belonging to EWS (Annual income less than USD $1490) treated in a Government Hospital in North India from Jan 2016 to July 2016 was retrospectively reviewed. Children were administered a risk stratified induction chemotherapy (3 drug induction for standard risk and 4 drug induction for high risk ALL). Treatment was provided free of cost by support from government and NGOs. Results: Out of the total 69 newly diagnosed ALL registered in Pediatric Oncology clinic at KGMU, from 1st Jan 2016 to 31st July 2016, 57 (83%) belonged to EWS (44 boys, 13 girls). Eleven children (19%) abandoned treatment during induction. Of the 46 children who took treatment as per protocol (43 Bcell, 3 Tcell ALL), 18 had standardrisk disease, while 28 had highrisk disease. At presentation 54% children were undernourished (33% severe undernutrition), 28% chemotherapy were encountered in 59% (27/46) children, leading treatment interruptions (of > 2 days) in 46% (21/46) and death in 30% (14/46) children. Causes of death included infections (10), Tumor Lysis syndrome (3), and bleeding (1). 70% (32/46) children completed there induction chemotherapy and all of them were in morphological remission. Conclusions: Outcome of ALL induction in children from EWS is poor. A significant proportion of these children are undernourished. Despite the provision of free treatment, abandonment rates are high. The risk of complications and death is also higher in these children. P-061 Prevalence and Predictors of Invasive Fungal Infections in Children with Persistent Febrile Neutropenia Treated for Acute Leukemia A Prospective Study J. Yadav 1, A. Singh1, R. Seth1, I. Xess2, M. Jana3, S. Kabra1 1ALl India Institute of Medical Sciences, Pediatrics, Delhi, India; 2ALl India Institute of Medical Sciences, Microbiology, Delhi, India; 3ALl India Institute of Medical Sciences, Radiology, Delhi, India Background/Objectives: Febrile neutropenia is the most frequent life threatening complication of chemotherapy among children with cancer. Fungal infections are emerging concern due to improved survival secondary to better supportive care and aggressive chemotherapy. The study was planned to ascertain prevalence and predictors of invasive fungal infection following revised EORTC criteria. Objectives: To ascertain the prevalence of invasive fungal infections (IFI) during febrile neutropenic episodes in children with acute leukemia, and determine the predictors for IFI; and to identify the etiological fungal species causing IFI. Design/Methods: In this observational study children between 112 years of age on chemotherapy for acute leukemia with febrile neutropenia were enrolled. Diagnosis of IFI was based on EORTC criteria and was classified as proven, probable and possible IFI. Prevalence was reported in mean \u00b1 95% CI form and etiological species were presented in form of frequency distribution. Results: 319 episodes involving 187 children of febrile neutropenia were screened and 74 were enrolled. Seventeen episodes fulfilled EORTC criteria for IFI giving a prevalence of 22.97% (13.99 34.21). Documented cases were further classified into proven3(17.6%), probable 11(64.8%) and possible3(17.6%). On multivariate analysis, abnormal CXR and clinical sinusitis were found to be important predictors of IFI. Most common fungus isolated was Aspergillus sp. followed by Candida sp. Aspergillus and candida species were most commonly isolated from sputum and blood respectively. Most common isolate in oral scrapping was Candida followed by Aspergillus. All the episodes in which we isolated Aspergillus were positive for galactomannan antigen test. Out of 74 cases, six (8.1%) were blood culture positive sepsis. Conclusions: Prevalence of invasive fungal infection in the study was 23%. Abnormal chest x ray and clinical sinusitis were found to be important predictors of IFI. P-062 Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Outcome and Survival in Turkey: Marmara Experience B. Yilmaz 1, N. E. Senay1, B. Berk1 1Marmara Pendik Training and Research Hospital, Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Istanbul, Turkey Background/Objectives: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common form of cancer in children accounting for approximately 25% of all pediatric cancers. The 5year survival is approximately 85% in developed countries. We examined the our ALL patients 5year survival rates and causes of mortality. Design/Methods: A total of 120 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (one18 years) diagnosed between 2011 to 2016 were included in the study. The patients with secondary malignancy, age <1year and children with relapsed disease were excluded. All patients were stratified and treated according to StJude Total XV Study Protocol. Results: The mean duration of followup was 29 months found. The fiveyear overall survival was 77% found. Seventeen patients were lost to follow up. Unfortunately, the most common cause of death was infectionrelated complications (82%.[14/17 patients]). We did not see any difference in the risk of mortality among risk groups (Log Rank p=0.14). But standard risk better survival than other two risk groups. The children with PreB cell leukemia had better survival compared to other types of cell leukemia although it was statically significant (Log Rank, p<0.0001) (preB 81% vs Tcell:62% vs Burkitt leukemia 50%) Conclusions: The infectious complications are still a major cause of a death in developing countries (etc. Turkey) during the treatment of children with ALL. Our patients died mainly of infectious diseases and sepsis leading to present difference in the success of leukemia treatment with developed countries. P-063 Prognostic Value of Neuropilin1 /CD304 in Children with BLineage Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia M. Zakaria 1, M. Hesham1, D. El nemer2, M. Hashem2, (NRP1) novel receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) which expressed in endothelial and tumor cells and promotes proliferation and chemotaxis of leukemic cells in response to VEGF. Inhibition of NRP1 functions may provide a new therapeutic strategy for treatment of ALL. We aimed To study NRP1/CD304 expression profile of normal B lineage and leukemic lymphoblasts, its prognostic value and its role in Minimal Residual Disease detection. Design/Methods: A prospective casecontrol study was conducted on forty newly diagnosed patients with acute Blymphoblastic leukemia (22males and 18 females) with a mean age of 6.68\u00b14.70 years and forty age and sex matched subjects as a control group. Expression of NRP1 (CD304) by flow cytometry was done at diagnosis and at the end of induction therapy. Results: Forty five % of the cases were positive for CD304 expression and 55% were negative. There were no statistically significant differences between cases with positive and-ve expression of CD304 regarding clinical presentation, morphology, immunophenotyping and CNS infiltration. But there were statistical significance differences between them as regards to relapse (77.7% relapsed cases were CD304 positive) and prognosis (55% of cases with positive CD304 expression died). There were positive significant correlation with CD 304% and age, bone marrow blast cells and LDH level and -ve significant correlation with WBCs count and Hb level. There was no significant difference between CD304 positive and negative cases regarding overall Survival rate, while Diseasefree survival at 12 months was 75.4% in CD304 positive cases and 33.3% in negative cases with a high significant difference. Conclusions: Neuropilin1(CD304) with a high expression on bone marrow blasts can be considered as a marker for bad prognosis in children with Blineage ALL and could be used during followup and disease monitoring.

P-064 Preliminary Data of Multicenter Project Concerning Asparaginase Activity - Focus on Silent Inactivation B. ZalewskaSzewczyk 1, K. Wyka1, J. Walenciak1, A. Dusza2, J. UrbanskaRakus7, W. 1Medical of Pediatrics Oncology Hematology and Diabetology, Lodz, Poland; 2Medical University of of Pediatrics Hematology and Oncology, Warsaw, Poland; 3Medical University of Silesia in Zabrze, Katowice, Poland; 5Mediacal of and Hematology, 6Medical University Lublin, Poland; 7Center of pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Chorzow, Background/Objectives: Asparaginase is a crucial agent of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However its use is limited due to hypersensivity, moreover the generated antiasparaginase antibodies can lead to the inactivation of the drug without symptoms of allergy. This implies the risk of ineffective treatment. The aim of the study is to evaluate the incidence of silent inactivation and allergy to asparaginase in children with newly diagnosed ALL. Design/Methods: In June 2016, we started systematic monitoring of asparaginase activity in patients treated in 7 Polish pediatric centers. The current report summarizes 10 months of study duration. At present, 113 children, treated according to ALLIC 2009 protocol were enrolled in the study. In case of overt allergy/insufficient drug activity, asparaginase preparation was changedfro native E.coli pegylated E. coli asparaginase, and subsequently Erwinase. Asparaginase activity for native preparations used 2 or 3 times weekly was determined using ELISA method before each subsequent dose, and for pegylated asparaginase on 8th and 15th day after administration. Results: In total 776 asparaginase measurements were performed. Among 113 children the preparation was changed in 23 patients to pegylated asparaginase and in 8 patients subsequently to Erwinase. In 9 children treated with native E. coli asparaginase and in 6 children treated with pegylated asparaginase silent inactivation was found. On the basis of previous analyzes, indicating the importance of asparaginase for the outcome of ALL, it can be stated that implementation of systematic monitoring of asparaginase activity improved the effectiveness of treatment in 15 (13%) studied children. Conclusions: Preliminary data analysis indicate that 13% of children exhibit insufficient asparaginase activity during treatment according to the ALL IC 2009 protocol, despite the lack of clinically apparent allergy. Because of the clinical relevance of the study, and the importance to the effectiveness of therapy, it is advisable to continue the study. Haematology Myeloid Leukemias, Myelodysplastic and Myeloproliferative Syndromes Slovak Children with AML During Period 20002014 M. Achbergerova 1, Puskacova1, E. A. Oncology, Slovak Slovak Republic Background/Objectives: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is relatively rare in children. In the Slovak Republic, approximately 28 new cases of childhood AML are diagnosed per year. We sought to describe the incidence of cytogenetic aberrations associated with AML and to evaluate the eventfree and overall survival among children and adolescents with AML in our population. Design/Methods: In total, 122 children and adolescents age 018 years were diagnosed with AML between 2000 and 2014. These children were treated according to AML BFM strategy at one of three Slovak centres of pediatric hematology and oncology. Bone marrow samples were analyzed at a central laboratory using conventional cytogenetics, fluorescence insitu hybridization (FISH) and molecular genetic methods. A retrospective analysis was based on our laboratory and clinical data from Slovak clinical cancer registry of children and adolescents. Results: Incidence of selected cytogenetic aberrations was as nine cases AML (7.38%) were children with Down syndrome. Fiveyear eventfree survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) rates in this cohort were 49,0% (N=122; 57 deaths) and 53.2%(N=122; 62 events), respectively. Sixtysix patients were stratified into the high risk group with OS and EFS 52.95% (32 deaths) and 46.87% (36 events), respectively; in standard risk group rates 63.2% for OS (N=36; 13 deaths) and 60.58% for EFS (N=36; 14 events) were achieved. Patients with positive t(15,17) abbrevation achieved better and the same rates for OS and EFS (73.7%) in contrast to patients without this genetic change (54.9% and 50.8%). Conclusions: Based on these results, we have planned a new strategy with the aim of improving outcomes for these children by centralizing treatment at a single center, optimizing the timing of stem cell transplant, and implementing additional genetic testing at the AML BFM central laboratory in Germany.

Kandeel2, Cancer Institute, pediatric oncology, Cairo, Egypt; 2National Cancer Institute, clinical pathology, Cairo, Egypt Background/Objectives: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains a challenging disease in developing countries. To identify Overall Survival (OS), Disease Free Survival (DFS) and their correlation with different risk factors, as well as demonstration of the common causes of mortality. Design/Methods: A retrospective descriptive study included 103 newly diagnosed AML patients age less than 18 years receiving treatment at national cancer institute, Cairo University, Egypt in the period from January 2008 till December 2010.Risk factors including age, gender, initial WBC, cytogenetics, CNS status and antifungal prophylaxis were collected. Results: The 2 years DFS was 27.1%, with a median survival of 10 months, and 2 years OS was 30.4% with a median survival of 16 months and 95% confidence interval (5.414.8), (11.2420.76) respectively. Early deaths were seen in 15 patients (14.6%) mainly due to infections. Late deaths were seen in 48 patients mainly due to progressive disease and infections. Infection related mortality (IRM) represented 42.9% from all mortality causes, (26.2%) of the patients. About 74 patients showed picture of possible fungal pneumonia (39 patients during induction chemotherapy, 17 post first consolidation and 18 post second consolidation). Regarding antifungal prophylaxis, primary prophylaxis fluconazole was given in 21 patients (20.4%). Regarding secondary prophylaxis, 45 patients received itraconazole, 24 patients received voriconazole. Analysis of the data revealed statistically significant correlation between DFS and response to induction chemotherapy (p value<0.001), presence of chloroma (p value 0.040) and voriconazole prophylaxis (P value<0.001). Correlation with OS was statistically significant with response to induction chemotherapy (P value0.002), association with favorable cytogenetic (t (8, 21) and inv 16) (p value 0.039), with chloroma (p value 0.023) and voriconazole prophylaxis (p value 0.001). Conclusions: Infection related mortality is an important cause of poor survival outcome in our study population. These results warrant the use of antimold primary prophylaxis for all pediatric patients with AML. P-067 Polish Experience of the Treatment of Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia in Children from 2005 to 2016 M. Czogala 1, K. PawinskaWasikowska1, T. Ksiazek2, A. Rodziewicz3, W.

The aim of the study was analysis of the treatment outcome of APL in children in Poland from 2005 to 2016. Design/Methods: All 36 patients with genetically confirmed APL treated in Poland in analyzed period were eligible for the study, 33 of them were treated with AMLBFM2004 Interim (20052015 - period I) and 3 with AMLBFM 2012 (20152016 - period II). Median observation time was 42 months and 8 months respectively in periods I and II. All patients in the period I received standard chemotherapy with alltrans retinoic acid (ATRA), in the period II two patients were treated with induction chemotherapy, ATRA and arsenic trioxide (ATO), one patients with ATRAATO without chemotherapy. We analyzed survival rates and the treatment failures. Results: Probability of 5years overall survival (OS), event free survival (EFS) and relapse free survival (RFS) were 0.822\u00b10.067; 0.828\u00b1 0.064 and 0.960\u00b10.036 respectively for all analyzed patients. Four (11%) early deaths (510 days from diagnosis) caused by severe coagulation disorders were observed. White blood cell count at diagnosis was significantly higher in children who died early compared to the other patients (median [range]: 91.6\u00d7103/l [40196\u00d7103/l] vs 5.6 \u00d7103/l [0.45140 \u00d7103/l], p=0.012). One patient (2.4%) died of severe infection in course of disease progression 1.9 month after diagnosis. Relapse occurred in one patient (2.4%), 13.5 months after first remission, the patient died because of disease progression. All events occurred in the patients from the period I, there were no deaths after the year 2012. Conclusions: Treatment outcome in analyzed group is similar to the results reported by other study groups. The main cause of deaths were coagulation disorders at the beginning of disease. Early, accurate diagnosis followed by the specific treatment enables to reduce number of early deaths. P-068 Clinical Characteristics and Outcome of Children with Acute Myeloid Leukemia Below One Year of AGE: A Single Centre Experience from a Developing Country S. Eissa 1, S. Semary1, M. Hammad1, Genetics Egypt; HospitalEgypt, Clinical Pharmacy, Cairo, Egypt; 6Children's Cancer HospitalEgypt, Clinical Research Department, Cairo, Egypt Background/Objectives: Myeloid leukemia occurring in children below one year of age has distinctive clinical and biological features than that occurring in older children. Hyperleukocytosis, extramedullary disease and CNS involvement as well as Mixed Lineage Leukemia gene rearrangements (MLLr) at diagnosis are common. Design/Methods: Retrospective analysis of the clinical and biological features of infants with AML treated at our cancer center during the period from July 2007 till December 2015. Results: A total of 60 patients were diagnosed. Patients with Down syndrome were excluded. Thirty two males (53%) and 28 females (46.7%), male to female ratio (1:1.2). Mean age at diagnosis was 5.4, range (1 - 11.9) months, initial Total Leukocytic Count (TLC) ranged between(1370) \u00d7109/L, mean 71 \u00d7109/L. Extramedullary disease was present in 18 (30%) of patients. Nine patients (15%) had CNS disease at presentation. Monocytic differentiation was present in 28 (46.7%) and amegakaryoblastic leukemia M7 in 18(30%) of patients. MLL gene rearrangements were present in 17 (28.3%) patients, with t (9, 11) being the most frequent; found in 7(11.7%) patients. Other cytogenetic abnormalities as t(1, 22) and inv (16) were diagnosed less frequently in 6(10%) and 3 (5%) of patients respectively. All patients with t(1,22) had M7 and all those with inv (16) had M4Eo morphology. Multiple trisomies were identified in 7 (11.7 %) patients. Most patients experienced significant chemotherapy toxicity and 36 (60%) required ICU admission. Of the whole cohort, 25 (41.7%) patients achieved complete remission after induction, of them 21 patients (84%) are still alive in first complete remission (CR). Conclusions: Dealing with infants with myeloid leukemia is a real challenge especially in countries with limited resources. Improving supportive care, refinement of the risk stratification to identify those who require more intensive chemotherapy including transplantation is required to improve outcome. Best survival was for those who entered into CR after induction (84%). P-069 Mutation of Genes Affecting the RAS Pathway Associated with PTPN11 in Pediatric Acute Myeloid Leukemia F. Gomes Andrade 1, F. Vicente dos C\u00e2ncer, Research Center, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Background/Objectives: Deregulation of the RAS signaling cascade is often caused by somatic mutations in genes encoding proteins which influence the activity of this pathway and include NRAS, KRAS, FLT3, PTPN11, and cKIT. Our aim was to describe a comprehensive mutational screen of key exons of these genes in a cohort of 439 unselected pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (pAML) cases at diagnosis and to evaluate their prognostic value in the probability of overall survival (pOS). Design/Methods: Hotspot regions of NRAS, KRAS, FLT3, PTPN11, and cKIT were directly sequenced for the screen of mutations. Survival analysis was performed in a subset of patients treated following BFMAML2004 guidelines, out of clinical trials. Results: RAS pathway mutations were found in 35.1% of the study cohort, mainly represented by among KMT2A rearranged cases (12.7%) and rarely observed concomitant in more than one gene (8.8%). Two boys (7 and 13 year old) presented mutation in PTPN11 and NRAS or KRAS, respectively. Both died less than 1 month after diagnosis. The cumulative 5year pOS for pAML was 36.0\u00b13.8% (excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia). Patients with skin color considered White presented better outcome than NonWhites (pOS 43.4\u00b15.9% and 29.5\u00b14.9%, respectively), as well as patients aged >12 years old (pOS 37.2\u00b15.1%) and those with CBFbMYH11 (pOS 73.7\u00b111.3%). PTPN11 mutations in exon 3 were found in overall analysis to be associated with adverse prognosis, and identified by multivariate analysis as independent prognostic factor (hazard ratio of 3.6; 95% confidence interval of 1.77.7). Conclusions: Although there is a need of further action to improve the overall survival rates of pAML patients, these aberrations are likely to guide the stratification and may direct the development of novel therapeutic targeted therapies. P-070 Outcome of Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia in Indian Children in a Newly Established Pediatric Cancer Center K. Viswanathan 1, S. Jayabose1, A. Annamalai1, N. Iyer1, V. Bharathi1, K. Rathnam1 1Meenakshi Hospital & Research Centre, Pediatric HematologyOncology, Madurai, India Background/Objectives: There is paucity of data on the outcome of childhood AML in India. The objective of this study is to analyze the outcome of childhood AML in our pediatric cancer center established in 2010; and compare the outcomes with two different treatments. Design/Methods: We reviewed the data on 78 children consecutively diagnosed from 2010 to 2016, including 5 MDSAML and 5 APL, one DSAML and one acute Male: age: 9 years; (range, 0.5 to 21years). First 40 patients seen in 2010 to 2013 (Group I) were treated on a modified MRC10 regimen. The next 38 patients (Group II) received a less intensive regimen (induction with cytarabine plus daunorubicin; and reduced doses of mitoxantrone in consolidation); but nine received allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT), 7 in first remission and two in second remission-6 from matched siblings; 3 haploidentical parents. Results: One patient moved to another center; none abandoned treatment. Sixtythree of 77 (81.8%) achieved complete remission (CR). Overall, 40 patients (51.9%) are alive, including all 9 who received SCT; and 8 of 12 patients with chloroma. Median followup is 24 months (range, 3 80). Estimated 3yr overall survival (OS): 42.3%. All 12 refractory patients, and 15 of 17 relapsed patients, and 4 of 5 MDSAML patients died of disease. Deaths during induction and in remission were higher, 7.5% and 21.8% respectively in Group I; vs 2.7% and 9.7% in Group II, but not statistically significant. Estimated 3year OS was higher for group II (51% vs 38%), but not statistically significant (p= 0.15). Conclusions: MRC10 based regimen results in excessive treatmentrelated mortality in Indian children with AML. But use of less intensive induction and consolidation, with allogeneic stem cell transplant for intermediate and highrisk patients is likely to improve their survival. P-071 Clinical Features of Myeloid Sarcoma in Indian Children with Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia S. Jayabose 1, N. Iyer1, K. Viswanathan1, A. Annamalai1 1Meenakshi Mission Pediatric HematologyOncology, Madurai, India Background/Objectives: Myeloid sarcoma (MS) is defined as extramedullary lesions in acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) The reported incidence and prognostic significance MS has been variable; and there are no data on MS in Indian children. The objective of our study is to review the clinical features of children with MS in a single institution seen over a period of 7 years. Design/Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the data on all cases of AML, including 3 isolated MS seen from 2010 to 2016: clinical and molecular features, details of treatment and their outcome. Results: Among 83 consecutively diagnosed cases of AML, 12 patients had MS: three had isolated MS without AML; excluding those three, 9 of 80 (11%) had AML with MS (AMLMS); Median age: 8 years (range, 120). Male: female, 9:3. Three had disseminated MS, involving two or more sites-including asymptomatic pelvic and intracranial lesions. None had leukemic cells in spinal fluid. Seven of 9 patients with AMLMS had t(8;21). Cytogenetics was not done in the three cases of isolated MS. Ten patients received treatment as per a modified MRC10 protocol; one had less intensive treatment\u2014induction with cytarabine pus daunorubicin, and consolidation with highdose cytarabine; one infant was treated according to COG 2971. Eleven patients had 3 to 4 doses intrathecal cytarabine. Five had local radiation: 4 in first remission; one in second remission. Two had allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT); one in second remission. Eight patients are alive, including all 3 with isolated MS and the two who had SCT. Median followup of surviving patients: 48 months (range, 970). Conclusions: MS occurs in approximately 11% of Indian children with AML. It is frequently associated with t(8;21); and may be associated with occult and asymptomatic disseminated lesions. Prognostic significance of AMLMS is unclear; but isolated MS may have a better prognosis than AMLMS. P-072 Analysis of Prognostic Factors in Children with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (M4/M5) C. kai 1 1Shanghai Children'S Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University, Hematology and Oncology, Shanghai, China Background/Objectives: To investigate the clinical efficacy and prognostic factors of M4/M5 subtypes in children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Design/Methods: A retrospective analysis of the clinical data of M4/M5 subtypes in our hospital from January 2009 to December 2014 was carried out. The longterm efficacy, prognosis and relapse factors were analyzed. Results: (1) The clinical data of 46 cases were collected, among which 38 cases were treated with more than 2 courses, including male 22 cases, female 16 cases, M4 19 cases and M5 19 cases. The median age was 5 years.5year overall survival rate (OS) and 5year eventfree survival rate (EFS) were 57.7\u00b19.3% and 52.4 45.4 \u00b111.9%.(2) Compared the risk (3) Single factor analysis showed extramedullary infiltration, d8 assessment and treatment were prognostic factors 95%CI 1.72622.176, P=0.005) were the independent risk factors of affecting survival. Conclusions: (1) Strengthening treatment and adequate courses are the keys to improve the overall curative effect in children with M4/M5 subtypes.(2) Extramedullary infiltration was the risk factor for survival and recurrence in M4/M5 subtypes. (3) We advise the children who have the initial symptoms and molecular biology with poor prognostic factors to choose hematopoietic stem cell transplantation as early as possible. P-073 Control of Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukaemia with A Dose Reduced Induction Treatment in Malawi A. Mpasa 1, S. Wachepa1, to treat, in low income countries (LICs) like Malawi. Limited supportive care resources preclude the use of effective treatment protocols, as used in high income countries. In Malawi, AML is treated supportively, without chemotherapy. However, inadequate blood product support and community palliative services results in poor symptom control, particularly of bleeding. In order to alleviate symptoms through disease control, we used a modified chemotherapy protocol for childhood AML. We hereby share our experience of using this protocol at Kamuzu Central Hospital. Design/Methods: Between February and December 2016, children with AML, without FABM3 subtype, were treated with a modified induction protocol. This comprised of Doxorubicin 20mg/m2 for 4 days and Cytarabine 100mg/m2 twice a day for 10 days. Ciprofloxacin, Itraconazole and Cotrimoxazole were used as infection prophylaxis. The diagnosis of AML was established by assessment of bone marrow morphology. Data was collected on the demographics, baseline clinical and hematological features, toxicity, remission status and survival at the end of induction. Results: Nine (64%) children, were treated on this induction protocol. Median age was 9 years (range 612) and 4 (44%) were male. Baseline median hematological parameters were White cell count: 66 \u00d7 (77.7%) suffered from febrile neutropenia. Two patients (22.2%) suffered from mucositis. Median time to count recovery was 23.5 days (range 2044). Median duration of admission was 25 days (range 2048). Of evaluable patients, post induction overall survival and complete remission rate were 8/9(88.8%) and 8/8 (100%) respectively. Median Lansky score at admission and discharge were 80 (range 10100) and 100 (range 50100), respectively. Conclusions: This modified chemotherapy regimen holds promise as a deliverable, safe and effective regimen for control of AML in LICs. P-074 Characteristics and Outcome of Children with Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Down Syndrome Ineligible for Clinical Studies K. Nakashima 1,2, D. Hasegawa2,3, T. Miyamura2,4, S. Adachi2,9, T. Taga2,10 1Kyushu University School of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Fukuoka, Japan; 2Japan Children's Cancer Group, AML committee, Tokyo, Japan; International Hospital, Department of Pediatrics, Tokyo, Japan; 4Osaka University School of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Osaka, Japan; 5Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Nagoya, Japan; 6Mie University School of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Mie, Japan; 7Hirosaki University Graduate School of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Hirosaki, Japan; 8National Center for Child Health and Development, Division of Leukemia and Lymphoma Children's Cancer Center, Tokyo, Japan; 9Kyoto University, Department of Human Health Sciences, Kyoto, Japan; 10Shiga University of Medical Science, Department of Pediatrics, Shiga, Japan Background/Objectives: High survival rates of 8090% are reported on recent clinical trials for children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and Down syndrome (DS: AMLDS) with reduceddose chemotherapies. However, there are certain number of children with AMLDS complicated with congenital heart disease (CHD), gastrointestinal anomaly, severe infection, and/or other complications, thus are ineligible for clinical trials. Design/Methods: Because data on outcomes of such children are scarce, we retrospectively analyzed clinical characteristics and outcomes of children with AMLDS who were excluded from the Japanese clinical studies conducted between January 2000 and December 2015: AML99DS, CCLSG9805DS, JPLSG AMLD05 and AMLD11. Results: Thirteen children (6 boys and 7 girls) were identified and were ineligible for the following reasons; CHD (N=8), pulmonary fibrosis (N=1), (N=1), complicated with hemophagocytosis (N=1), and age excess of 21 years at diagnosis (N=1). Median age at diagnosis was 14 months (range, 5 months to 21.4 years). GATA1 mutation was detected in three out of four screened cases. Among all, twelve cases were treated with curative intent. Four cases received lowdose cytarabinebased chemotherapy (1030 mg/m2/day): three with severe CHD failed to achieve remission and died of disease; one with pulmonary fibrosis successfully achieved remission but eventually died of infectious complications. Eight cases underwent dosemodified standard chemotherapy for AMLDS: six are alive in remission, whereas two had relapsed (one died of disease and another are alive with disease). The patient with hypoxic encephalopathy received best supportive care and died of disease. Finally, six remains in continuous remission, one is alive with disease, and six died (five of leukemia and one of infection). Conclusions: Optimal dose intensity of curative chemotherapy for children with AMLDS harboring severe comorbidities should be explored. P-075 Epigenetic Therapy for Treatment Pediatric Acute Myeloid Leukemia V. Nemirovchenko 1, A. Popa1, G. Mentkevich1 1Federal State Budgetary Institution \u00abN.N.Blokhin Russian Cancer Research Center\u00bb under the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, Children Hematology, Moskow, Russia Background/Objectives: The majority of children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) respond to initial chemotherapy and achieve a complete remission, yet only a minority experience longterm survival because a large proportion of patients eventually relapse with therapyresistant disease. The combination deacetylase inhibitor, alltrans retinoic acid) with chemotherapy improve the results of treatment children with AML. Design/Methods: We report outcomes for 138 children who underwent chemotherapy for de novo AML between 2002 and 2016. Median age was 5.5\u00b11.1 years. Forty (29.0%) children were included into AML2002 protocol, 70 (48.9%) - AML2007 protocol, 31 (22.5%) - AML2007 protocol. There were Standard, Intermediate and High risk groups. The vast majority was High risk 47.8%. he patients got (Induction therapy, Intensification, Consolidation, Maintenance therapy) after AML2002 protocol. Valproic acid (VPA) and alltransretinoic acid (ATRA) were added to the chemo after AML2007 protocol. The patients included into AML2012 protocol received chemotherapy with epigenetic drugs (VPA, ATRA, Decitabine). Results: The number of the good responses on the 15th day of the therapy was the same: AML2002 - 77.5%; AML-2007 - 80.6%; AML2012 We achieved complete remission in 32 (80.0%) of the patients after Induction AML2002 protocol, 62 (92.5%) - after AML2007and 30 (100%) - after AML2012 (p=0.015). Probability of 5year disease free survival was 46.5\u00b18.3% (median follow up 79.6\u00b112.9 month) for protocol AML2002, 53.5\u00b16.6% (median follow up 72.8\u00b17.1 month) - AML2007 and 67.2\u00b111.1% (median follow up 41,1\u00b14,6 month) - AML2012 (=0,035). Overall survival was 47.9\u00b18.2% (median follow up 85.7\u00b112.7 month) for protocol AML2002, 53.5\u00b16.6% (median follow up 71.9\u00b16,8 month) - AML2007 and (median follow up 40.5\u00b13.9 month) - AML2012 (=0.1). Conclusions: The use of these drugs can be therapeutic used as part of a combination with other therapeutic modalities. P-076 Impacts of HUWE1 Knockdown in Human Hematopoietic Stem Cells with A Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, Brazil Background/Objectives: Acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood malignancy. Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) is present in 5% of childhood cases. Ph positive leukemias express the tyrosine kinase BCRABL, that is responsible for constitutive activation of RAS pathway and mediates leukemic cells proliferation. Even with high cure rates, a lot of patients develop resistance to treatment and relapse. Previously published data suggests association between hyperactivation of RAS pathway and favorable treatment outcome, pointing to a new research approach. HUWE1 participates in negative feedback mechanism controlling Shoc2 activity in activation of ERK1/2. Thus, it can be assumed that loss of HUWE1 would lead to increased activation of ERK1/2 and, therefore, hyperactivation of RAS pathway. Objectives: To evaluate the impacts of HUWE1 knockdown in human hematopoietic stem cells with KRAS mutation. Design/Methods: CD34+ cord blood cells were transduced with miRE lentiviral particles for gene knockdown. Flow cytometry, differentiation markers and CFC assays were performed. Results: Cocultures transduced with both KRAS and shHUWE1 showed reduction in growth when compared to the ones transduced with shSCR. When compared to nontransduced cells, all 3 groups presented higher cumulative growth. The cobblestone area formation follows the same pattern shown by cumulative growth. In sorted cocultures, after 3 weeks in culture, nontransduced cells differentiated mainly in granulocytic cells while HUWE1 knockdown shifted differentiation towards the myelomonocytic cells. In CFC assays, neither colony formation units (CFUGM) nor burstformation units (BFUE) were strongly affected by knockdown of HUWE1. KRAS mutant cells were severely impacted in BFUE formation. Cells showing knockdown of HUWE1 as well as the KRAS mutation were severely impacted in both types of colony formation units. Conclusions: These results suggest that HUWE1 has an impact in human hematopoietic stem cell differentiation, besides acting together with KRAS mutation in events such as proliferation and colony formation capacity. Financial Support: FAPESP (Process F. 1Hacettepe University, Department of Pediatrics Division of Pediatric Hematology, ANKARA, Turkey Background/Objectives: Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a rare malignancy of childhood which is composed of 3% of all pediatric leukemias. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) revolutionazed CML treatment and made it possible to avoid allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) for most of the patients. Here, we aimed to investigate the TKI responses of patients diagnosed CML in our department. Design/Methods: Patients diagnosed with CML, did not underwent SCT and is still on followup since 2012 in Hacettepe University Department of Pediatric Hematology were included. Four patients who underwent SCT between this period were excluded. The clinical features and TKI responses of these patients were evaluated. Results: There were nine patients. Age at diagnoses were median 13 years (1016 years). Two girls and 7 boys. Treatment was started with imatinib for all of the cases. Two patients responded imatinib and major molecular response (MMR) was achieved in 4 and 9 months respectively. Two patients were diagnosed within the three months and MR have not been checked yet. The other 4 patients did not responded imatinib therapy in 18 months, since they do not have an eligible donor we replaced imatinib with dasatinib therapy. One patient achieved MMR with imatinib in 3 months but he developed leukopenia so imatinib replaced with dasatinib for this case. Patients achieved MMR with dasatinib except one. In this case dasatinib replaced with nilotinib and MMR achieved within 3 months of nilotinib treatment. One patient needed to interrupt dasatinib therapy because of gastrointestinal bleeding, after 1 week of interruption dasatinib started again no bleeding observed and he is still on molecular remission. Conclusions: TKIs are effective in the CML treatment and MMR could be achieved with the change between these drugs when an adverse events occur or an eligible donor could not be found and SCT is not an option. P-078 Clinical Study of Children with Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia Treated with Arsenic Trioxide: A Multicenter Study H. J. Zhu1, 1Shanghai Hospital, Hematology/Oncology, Shanghai, China Background/Objectives: Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is rare in children. Due to the lack of longterm followup, results of ATO and the concern about longterm ATO related toxicity, the main protocol for children with newly diagnosed APL is still a combination of ATRA and chemotherapy. Few studies have demonstrated the efficacy of ATO in the treatment of children with APL. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed 25 children with newly diagnosed APL treated with ATO in mulicenter. Design/Methods: To evaluate the efficacy of Children with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) treated with arsenic trioxide (ATO), we retrospectively reviewed 25 newly diagnosed APL patients treated mainly with alltransretinoic acid (ATRA) and ATO from 2 hospitals. According to different risk stratification by NCCN, 25 patients were separated into 2 groups, low risk group and high risk group. Results: Overall, 24 of 25 patients achieved hematological complete remission (HCR). In one case, the patient failed to enter HCR, because of early death. The median duration required to achieve HCR was 34 days (range, 2663 days). The median date to achieve molecular complete remission was 56 days (range, 30207 days). The 5year EFS and OS of 25 patients were (88.0\u00b16.5)% and (96.0\u00b13.9)%, respectively. The 5year EFS of low risk group and high risk group patients were (92.9\u00b16.9)% and (81.8\u00b111.6)% (P=0.44). ATO related side effects were mild, including abnormal liver tests and electrocardiogram, but were invertible after supportive therapy. At the end of each chemotherapy course, the urine arsenic concentration remained low and no chronic arsenic toxicity or second malignancies were found during the followup period. Conclusions: The ATRA plus ATO regimen is a promising and better treatment for childhood APL with positive PMLRARa fusion gene. It was necessary to make risk stratification in APL patients. Haematology Lymphomas P-079 Superior Outcome and Lower Cumulative Chemotherapy Doses in Adolescents and Young Adults (AYA) with NonAdvanced Diffuse Large BCell Lymphoma (DLBCL) Treated with Pediatric Chemotherapy Regimen Z. Afify 1 1Primary Children Hospital, Oncology, Salt Lake City, Usa Background/Objectives: Systematic data on the optimal treatment for AYA with DLBCL are lacking. Many are treated by RCHOP with favorable outcome. However pediatric based chemotherapy regimens have yielded equal or superior results. We present a series of AYA with DLBCL referred by medical oncologists to our children hospital in consideration for treatment on pediatric protocol. Design/Methods: Retrospective review of patients diagnosed with DLBCL between ages 16 and 24 years from 1/2002 to 3/2017. PMBCL was excluded. Clinical characteristics, staging, treatment details and outcome data were collected. These were compared with published data in young adults above 18 years of age treated by RCHOP. Results: Six AYA with DLBCL were identified. Five were male. Age at diagnosis ranged from 1620 years. Four were above 18 years old. Sites of presentation were bone n=4, rectum=1, abdomen n=1. None had bone marrow or CNS involvement. Stage was IIII Murphy/St Jude. This corresponds to Ann Arbor staging IIV. All six patients are alive and lymphoma free at last follow up (26 years, median 5 years). None received radiation therapy. All patients were treated per FAB/LMB regimen: Group A COPADM1&2, CYM1&2) n=5. Cumulative chemotherapy doses in 5 patients who received group B therapy were Cyclophosphamide 3.3 g/m2, Doxorubicin 120 were 7 intrathecal chemotherapy administrations (methotrexate, Cytarabine, hydrocortisone). Compared to this regimen, 6 courses of RCHOP consist of 1.22.5 fold cumulative doses of cyclophosphamide (4.5 grams/m2), Hydroxydaunorubicin (300 Vincristine (12 mg). Conclusions: In AYA with nonadvanced DLBCL, pediatric chemotherapy regimen provides an alternative to RCHOP, eliminates the use of radiation therapy and provides lower cumulative Anthracyline and alkylating doses. Pediatric regimen may reduce risk of long term cardiac and second cancer effects. P-080 Childhood Hodgkin Lymphoma: Single Center Experience E. Ataseven 1, Sivi1, and Oncology, Izmir, Turkey; 2Ege University Faculty of Medicine, of Radiation Oncology, zmir, Turkey Background/Objectives: Childhood Hodgkin lymphoma(HL) is a type of cancer of the lymphoid system.According to the Turkish Pediatric Oncology Group(TPOG) statistics lymphomas are the most common solid tumors of childhood(26,8%) and 9.9% of them are Hodgkin lymphomas.With current chemotherapy and radiotherapy regimens,most of the children with HL survive. In this study,our aim is to evaluate the clinical characteristics and treatment outcome of HL cases treated in our institution. Design/Methods: We evaluated the recordings of the patients with HL treated between 19872016 retrospectively.Demographic and clinical features,treatment results,overall survival(OS) and event free survival(EFS) rates were evaluated. Results: 104 patients were eligible out of 133 patients(F/M= 27 /77).The mean age was 9.5\u00b13.7 years.Most common complaint was lump in the neck(n=82).B symptoms were present in 42.3%(n:44).Most common B symptom was found to be fever.Histopathologic diagnosis revealed 65.3% mixed cellularity,19.2% nodular sclerosis.Stage Stage4 4 patients,most common metastatic site was lung(n:12).Fiftyeight patients were treated according to the GPOH 90/95 protocol,remaining patients were treated with other regimens(ABVD(n:10),MOPP/ABVD(n:25),MOPP(n:8),COPP(n:3)).Radiotherapy was performed to the primary tumor site in 91 cases.Relapse occurred in 16 patients,most of them were treated with MOPLACE(n:7) chemotherapy.Remission was achieved in 3 patients,10 patients died because of disease progression,3 patients refused treatment.Median followuptime was 10 respectively.Between GPOH 90/95 and ABVD,MOPP/ABVD treatment groups no was found in survival(p=0,882) and relapse rates(p=0,047). Conclusions: When our results were compared with the literature,it was seen that the most common type is mixed cellularity in accordance with the previous reports.In1970's 5years OS was 81%,in 2002 5years OS increased to 90%.Our survival rates were lower than original protocols.It was thought that it might be due to the fact that most patients in the study belonged to the era before 90's lowering the overall OS and EFS. P-081 Presentation of Burkutt's Lymphoma in a Tertiary Hospital in Ghana M. Barnabas 1, V. Paintsi2 1komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital, Cild Health Directorate, Anokye Teaching Hospital, Child Directorate, Kumasi, Ghana Background / Objectives Burkett's lymphoma (BL) is the most frequent subtype of NonHodgkin's lymphoma seen in childhood in subSahara Africa. BL is highly aggressive with a doubling time of approximately 24 hours. It responds favorably if diagnosed accurately and treated early. Prompt recognition and initiation of therapy are essential for improved survival. This study seeks to review the clinical presentation and imaging findings of patents' with Burkett's lymphoma in the pediatric population Design/Methods: This was a hospitalbased retrospective study which reviewed all the clinical and histopathological records of patients with Burkett's Lymphoma at the paediatric cancer unit Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital from January 2016 to December, 2016. Results: There were 35 children diagnosed, with male to female ratio of 3:2. The median age was 8years (Range; 2years15years).The maximum duration of symptoms was 4 weeks. The commonest symptom was swelling with the majority sites involved being abdomen 42.9%, jaw 25.7%, combined jaw and abdomen (14.2%) and other body sites (17%). Other presenting symptoms include fever (25.7%), 3(8.57%), breathing 1(2.85%). Stage III was the commonest stage seen at presentation in 13(37.14%) of the patients and those with stage IV were 5(14.3%), been the rarest. Stage I was 10(28.3%), whilst stage II was seen in 7(28%). Intent of treatment was 71.4% of patients for palliation and 28.6% of the patient's curative intent. Conclusions: Although Burkett's lymphoma is relatively cheap and easy to treat as compared to the other cancers, most of the patients presented with advanced disease impacting on the survival. Increased education on early warning signs for parents and healthcare personnel needs to be undertaken to reduce advanced disease at presentation. P-082 Clinical Characteristics and Outcome of PediatricType Follicular Lymphoma: Report from a Pediatric Cancer Center in a Developing Country S. Eissa 1, S. Semary1, A. Salama2, Pediatric HematIology/Oncology, Cairo, Egypt; Pathology Department, Cairo, Egypt Background/Objectives: Follicular lymphoma (FL) is rare to occur in children. Its pediatric variant (pFL) had been recently included in the updated WHO classification of lymphoid malignancies (2016). Patients usually present with a low stage disease, that is t(14,18) and BCL2 negative. Design/Methods: Retrospective analysis of the cases diagnosed with FL presented to our cancer center during the period between July 2007 to December 2016. Results: Over a period of 9 years, 3 patients were diagnosed with FL at our cancer center. All patients were males, presented with stage II disease, morphologically grade 3a. The first case: 7 years old male who presented with cervical lymphadenopathy and B symptoms. Tumor was CD20, BCL6 and prednisone) and is under follow up from July 2011 till now. The second case: An 8 years old male who had atypical lymphoid hyperplasia diagnosed 1 year prior to the diagnosis of FL in April 2014. Tumor was positive to CD20 and BCL6 and negative BCL2 with low expression of Ki67. He received RCHOP chemotherapy and involved field radiotherapy (IFRT) in addition and placed under follow up since April 2015. The third case: An 12 years old male presented with bilateral cervical and parotid lymph node enlargement. Biopsy showed positive reaction to CD20 in the neoplastic BCL2 diffusely highlighted the neoplastic cells. BCL6 and CD10 were positive. Ki67 labeling index was high (60%). He received RCHOP chemotherapy and is currently under follow up since June 2014. Conclusions: Patients with pFL presented to our center had localized disease, responded well to chemotherapy and had durable complete remission. Trial of less intensive chemotherapy, omission of radiotherapy and inclusion of new agents as Bendamustine with Rituximab based therapy should be attempted to minimize the late effects. P-083 Hodgkin Lyphoma in Children: A Single Center Experience in Turkey N. Eker 1, G. Tokuc1, B. Ylmaz1, E. Senay1, Istanbul, Turkey Background/Objectives: Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) is one of the most frequent cancers in adolescent and young adults and is curable in more than 90% of cases. The aim of this study was to assess the demographic, clinic data, prognostic factors and treatment/followup results of children who were diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma and followed in our center of Pediatric Oncology, Marmara University Medical Faculty, Istanbul, Turkey, for 20 years. Design/Methods: Children with HL who were diagnosed and treated at our center between 1996 and 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. Results: A total of 87 children with a mean age of 9,5\u00b13,9 years were treated for HL. Fiftyeight patients (67%) were males and 29 (33%) were females. Among them, 52% presented with advancedstage (stages III and IV) disease, 39 % had B symptoms, and 50,6% had mixed cellularity type of HL. Multiagent chemotherapy was the mainstay of treatment. All patients were treated with risked adapted received involved field radiotherapy. During th follow up ten patients had relapsed. The 5year overall survival rate was 87%, respectively. Stage, treatment risk groups, presence of B symptoms and histopathologic subtype had no significant effect on overall survival in univariate analysis while relapsed disease was the only significant factor on overall survival. Conclusions: Hodgkin lymphoma can be cured with chemotherapy combined with low dose IFRT however relapsed disease is still the significant factor on overall survival. P-084 Venous Thromboembolism in Childhood Cancer: Hodgkin Lymphoma is N. ElHaj 1, Friderici2, J. Luty3, M. Richardson3, S. Grewal3 1Baystate Medical Center, Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, Springfield, USA; 2Baystate Medical Center, Biostatics and Epidemiology, Springfield, USA; 3Baystate Medical Center D'Amour Center for Cancer Care, Springfield, USA Background/Objectives: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is understudied in pediatric cancer patients. This study evaluates risk of VTE in children with cancer and identifies highrisk diagnostic groups. Design/Methods: This single center retrospective cohort study included patients under 21 years old diagnosed with cancer between 1/01/20076/30/2016 and followed from date of diagnosis to date of VTE, age 21, or end of study, whichever occurred first. The institution's Tumor Registry captured a primary diagnosis of cancer and a secondary diagnosis of VTE was extracted using ICD codes. Patients were excluded if they were under the care of adult providers or subspecialists, had insufficient documentation, or were inaccurately identified. For patients diagnosed with HL, demographic, treatment and diseaserelated variables were obtained by manual chart review. Results: The study included 181 patients split into 3 groups: HL (n=18), (6%). 5.1 cancers 17.2 (95% CI 3.3, 88.7). Patients with HL only developed VTE in major upper body veins. Median time from HL diagnosis to VTE was 52 days (29 to 245 days), and all VTE incidents occurred prior to radiation. Within our cohort of patients with HL and VTE, 60% received chemotherapy per GPOHHD95 regimen. Both patients with refractory HL who proceeded with autologous bone marrow transplant had prior VTE during first line therapy for HL. All patients with HL and VTE had a negative family history, and thrombophilia workup performed in 3/5 patients was unremarkable. Conclusions: In our cohort, HL represented a highrisk group for VTE. If a larger cohort confirms these results, these children may be candidates for prophylactic anticoagulation during initial treatment. P-085 Clinical Characteristics and Outcome of Children and Adolescents with Anaplastic LargeCell Lymphoma in China: A Retrospective Study from the Chinese Children's Cancer Group Y.J. Gao 1, M. Xie2, H. Oncology, Shanghai, China; 2Xiangya Hospital Central South University, Department of Pediatric Hematology & Oncology, Changsha, China; 3Children's Hospital of Shanghai, Department of Hematology & Oncology, Shanghai, China; 4West China Second University Hospital of Sichuan University, Department of Pediatric Hematology & Oncology, Chengdu, China; 5Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute & Hospital, Department of Pediatric Oncology, Tianjin, China; 6Tongji Hospital Tongji Medical College Huazhong University of Science & Technology, Department of Pediatric Hematology & Oncology, Wuhan, China; 7Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Department of Hematology & Oncology, Soochow, China; 8Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Department of Pediatric Hematology & Oncology, Jinan, China; 9Xinhua Hospital, Department of Pediatric Hematology & Oncology, Shanghai, China; 10Wuhan Union Hospital, Department of Pediatric Hematology & Oncology, Wuhan, China Background/Objectives: To provide a description review and improve our understanding of the clinical characteristics and outcome of pediatric anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) in China. And the results can serve as baseline data to guide our future therapeutic protocol development. Design/Methods: We retrospectively evaluated clinical characteristics and outcomes of 80 children (16 years) with newly histopathologicallyconfirmed ALCL (52 boys, 28 girls) treated by ten large single institutions in China between January 2009 and June 2014. Results: Two patients (3%) had Stage I disease, 9 (11%) had Stage II, 64 (80 %) had Stage III, and 5 (6%) had Stage IV. Phenotyping demonstrated a predominance of in 72.5% of (58/80). Sixtyfive patients (81%) were treated with the CCCGBNHL2010 regimen (a Chinese nationalwide protocol for pediatric ALCL) and 15 cases (19%) treated with other regimens. At a median followup of 25.2 months (range, 7.174.8 months), the 3year of eventfree survival (EFS) was 65%\u00b16% in all patients. The 3year EFS was 57%\u00b17% and 78%\u00b111% for patients with or without B symptoms, respectively(P=0.01). Twentyfour patients experienced disease progression or relapse. The median time from initial diagnosis to tumor failure was 7.0 months (ranged, 1.5 42.6 months). At the last evaluation, there were 5 patients still alive after disease progression and relapse. Conclusions: The presenting features and outcome of children and adolescents with ALCL in this study were similar to those reported by other countries. Establishment of therapeutic strategies to improve survival for patients with disease progression or relapse should be the priority in our future clinical study. P-086 B Cell NonHodgkins Lymphoma (BNHL) and Residual Disease on Scan at Disease Assessment in Children Under 12 K. Green 1, D. Cheng2 1Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, Oncology, London, United Kingdom; 2Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, Haematology, London, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: Children with BNHL have good outcomes with intensive upfront chemotherapy. Disease relapse or progression is associated with very poor outcome. Early disease assessment and escalation of chemotherapy is necessary when there is no clear radiological earlytreatment response. The value of posttreatment imaging surveillance and biopsy of residual imaging abnormalities in detecting and preventing disease relapse/progression is unclear. We evaluated whether our patients with BNHL with residual radiological abnormalities received followup imaging and biopsies, and how these investigations affected clinical outcomes. Design/Methods: Retrospective data of all children diagnosed with BNHL between 20122017 at a UK tertiary paediatric oncology centre was collected. Patient age at diagnosis, gender, histology, MYC status, and bone marrow or CNS involvement were recorded. Chemotherapy regimes were recorded, including escalation from Group B to C. Followup imaging and clinic letters were analysed, with residual disease categorised according to formal radiology reports. Results: 27 children aged 1 to 11 years were diagnosed with BNHL; 23 males (85%) and 4 females (15%). 7 children had bone marrow positivity (26%), and 4 children CNS positivity (15%). 17 children (63%) were MYC positive. 20 children (74%) received group B treatment, and 7 (26%) group C treatment. 5 children (18%) demonstrated poor response to COP chemotherapy and were escalated to group C. At end of treatment, 5 children (19%) had \"no residual disease\", and 15 children (55%) \"almost certainly had no residual disease\". 6 children (22%) had abnormal findings; 4 underwent biopsy to exclude active disease. None of the children undergoing follow up imaging demonstrated disease relapse. One child died during treatment without achieving remission. Conclusions: None of our patients with residual imaging abnormalities at treatment completion had disease relapse or progression, questioning the clinical need for long term imaging, particularly if involving radiation. Biopsy provided reassurance without altering patient management. P-087 Risk Factors for Relapse in Children with Hodgkin Lymphoma Treated with Chemotherapy Alone Protocols V. Gupta 1, R. Sonowal1, T.B. Singh2, S.K. Gupta3 1Institute Varanasi, India; 2Institute of Medical Sciences Banaras Hindu University, Statistics, Varanasi, India; 3Institute of Medical Sciences Banaras Hindu University, Surgery, Varanasi, India Background/Objectives: Hodgkin lymphoma displays characteristic epidemiological, clinical and pathological features in different geographical areas. Objective was to analyze demographic profile, disease characteristics, event free survival (EFS), overall survival (OS) and risk factors for relapse in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) treated with chemotherapy only protocols. Design/Methods: Retrospective observational study was carried out in a university teaching hospital. Children below the age of 15 years diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma between Jan 2005 to Dec 2014 were included in the study. Results: 90 patients with mean age of 8.13 \u00b1 2.65 years (median age 8 years; range 4.515 years) were diagnosed and treated for HL during study period. Male to female ratio was 7.2:1. 12.2% and 87.8% patients had early and advanced stage disease respectively. B symptoms were present in 87.8% patients. Mean duration of symptoms was 9.66 \u00b1 6.30 months (median 8 months; range 236 months). Mixed cellularity was commonest histologic type. Overall survival (OS) and event free survival (EFS) was 88.8% and 84.5% respectively. OS in early stage and advanced stage disease was 90.0% and 89.0% respectively. In patients with or without bulky disease it was 53.3% and 92.2%. The EFS in early stage and advanced stage disease was 90.0% and 83.8% respectively. It was 59.3% for patients with bulky disease and 86.5% for those without bulky disease. Older age (10 years), bulky disease, low hemoglobin (7.0 g/dl), high leucocyte count (12000/mm3) at the time of diagnosis and protocol used (COPP) were risk factors for relapse. Conclusions: Our patient population had younger age, advanced disease, more B symptoms and bulky disease. Still, we achieved good OS and EFS with chemotherapy alone protocols. Patients with bulky disease had poor overall and event free survival. If radiotherapy is included in the protocol for bulky disease, the survival rates can be improved further. P-088 Treatment of Paediatric Hodgkins Lymphoma An Experience from a Paediatric Tertiary Centre Y. Gupta 1, D. Hobin1 1Birmingham Children's Hospital, Pediatric Oncology, Birmingham, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: We present a retrospective analysis of 39 pediatric patients with HL who received treatment at our center over a period of 4 years from 2013 to 2016 and aim to study the response to chemotherapy in pediatric patients with HL. Design/Methods: Patients diagnosed with HL were divided into 3 treatment groups depending on the stage of disease (1). The patients in group 1 received 2 cycles of vincristine, etoposide, prednisolone, doxorubicin (OEPA), group 2 received 2 cycles 2 cycles of either cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisolone, dacarbazine (COPDAC) and group 3 received 2 cycles of OEPA and 4 cycles of COPDAC. Patients with inadequate response received radiotherapy. Early PET response to treatment was analyzed. Results: Of the 39 patients, 21 were in group 1, 4 in group 2 and 14 in group 3. Of the 21 (53.8%) patients in group1, Complete metabolic response (CMR) was seen in 16 (76.1%) and partial response in 2 (9%) patients PET was not done in 3(%). 3 (14.2%) patients had a relapse. There were no deaths. Event free survival (EFS) and Overall survival (OS) for group 1 patients was 85.7% and 100% Of the 4(10.2%) patients in group 2, CMR was seen in 4 (100%) patients. 1(25%) patients had a relapse. EFS and OS for group 2 patients was 75% and 100%. Of 14(35.9%) patients in group 3, CMR was seen in 13(92.8%) patients and partial response in 1 (7.1%) patients. 1 (7.1%) patients had a relapse. EFS and OS for group 3 patients was 92.8% and 100% respectively. Conclusions: EFS for all patients treated for HL is 84.5% and overall survival is 100%. This study emphasizes the excellent outcome for pediatric HL to treatment. However, a study with a larger cohort of patients who are followed up for a longer time is required. P-089 Retrospective Analysis of Outcomes to Different Chemotherapy Regimens in Pediatric Hodgkins Lymphoma Y. gupta 1, D. Children's Hospital, paediatric oncology, Birmingham, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: Retrospective analysis of 81 pediatric patients with Hodgkins Lymphoma who received treatment over a period of 10 years from 2006 to 2016 and study the response to different chemotherapy regimens and hence identify the regimens with best outcomes. Design/Methods: Patients with HL were divided into 3 treatment groups depending on the stage. The patients in group 1 received 2 cycles of vincristine, etoposide, prednisolone, (CVP), group 2 received 2 group 3 received 2 cycles of OEPA and 4 cycles of COPDAC or COPP. Results: Of the 25 patients in group1, 21 patients treated with 2 cycles of OEPA 3 relapsed (EFS and OS, 85.7% and 100%) and 4 with 3 cycles of CVP, 2 relapsed (EFS and OS, 50% and 100%). Of the 11 patients in group 2, 4 treated with 2 cycles each of OEPA and COPDAC, 1 relapsed (EFS and OS, 75% and 100%), 4 treated with 2 cycles of OEPA and 2 cycles of COPP (100 % EFS and OS), 3 treated with 2 cycles each of OEPA and CHOP, 1 relapsed and 1 died (EFS and OS 6.6%). Of 45 patients in group 3, 14 treated with 2 cycles of OEPA and 4 cycles of COPDAC, 1 relapsed (EFS and OS, 92.8% and 100%), 31 treated with 2 cycles of OEPA and 4 cycles of COPP, 6 relapsed, 4 died (EFS and OS, 80.6% and 87%). Conclusions: For group 1 patients treatment with OEPA x2 chemotherapy, group 2 patients OEPA X 2, COPP X2, and for group 3 patients OEPA X 2, COPDAC X 4 have shown to have a better outcome. P-090 Evaluation of Musculoskeletal Complaints and Skeletal Involvements in Children with Newly Diagnosed Lymphoma and Solid Tumors D. Ince 1, M. Erdem1, F. Yenigurbuz1, D. Kizmazoglu1, Olgun1 Izmir, Turkey; 2Dokuz Eylul of Medicine, Dept. of Radiodiagnostics, Izmir, Turkey Background/Objectives: To evaluate patients who had musculoskeletal complaints at admission and/or skeletal involvement at diagnosis in our center. Design/Methods: Medical records of whole patients with diagnosis of lymphoma and solid tumors were analyzed retrospectively. Patients who admitted with musculoskeletal complaints and who had skeletal involvement at diagnosis were selected for analysis. Patient characteristics, complaints, skeletal involvement sites, misdiagnoses, differantial diagnosis diffuculities were analyzed. Results: There was 1061 patients with diagnosis of lymphoma and solid tumor in our clinic between 19882016. One hundred ninetyfour of them admitted with musculoskeletal system complaints and/or skeletal involvement at diagnosis. The median age at diagnosis for these 194 patients was 9yrs(4mos17.8yrs), M/F:1.3. The median duration of complaints was 2mos (1day2yrs). Before definitive diagnosis was done, patients had been admitted mean 2 times (16) to doctors. Oncologic diagnosis were as with atypical clinical features should be reevaluated because of possible underlying malignancy. Suspicion of malignancy must be ruled out by simple investigations. Medical history, through physical examination, laboratory, radiological evaluations are important for diagnosis. P-091 Hodgkin's Lymphoma in Paediatric Population: Analysis of Short Term Outcomes with ABVD and Non ABVD Based Treatment Protocols N. Jadhav 1, B. Dubashi1, S. Kayal1, P. Singh1, M. Paramanandhan1, E. Jafa1 1Jawaharlal Institute of Post graduate Medical Education and Research, Medical Oncology, PONDICHERRY, India Background/Objectives: Hodgkin's Lymphoma is one of the success stories in modern oncology. Cure rates as high as 90% are possible with the current modalities of treatment. ABVD has established itself as standard of care in adults. Contrary, there is no standard of care for paediatric Hodgkin's. Also there is no randomized trial comparing ABVD verses non ABVD regimens. Design/Methods: Consecutive patients diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma, treated at Regional Cancer Center JIPMER were analyzed retrospectively. Data was retrieved from the records section and patients were analyzed for clinical profile and outcomes with ABVD and non ABVD based treatment protocols. Results: A total of 47 patients were registered from October 2009 till January 2017. Median age of presentation was 12 years with male to female ratio of 3.27. Most common presenting complain was neck mass, seen in 63.82% of patients. Median symptom duration was 12 months prior to first contact with an Oncologist. B symptoms were seen in 44.68% of patients and bulky disease in 42.55%. Extranodal involvement was seen in 12.76% of patients. 53.19% patients presented in early stage with 60% being early stage unfavorable. Most common histology was classical Hodgkin's mixed cellularity ABVD and 23.4% with nonABVD protocols. 42.55% patients received RT, 45% each for bulky disease and as a part of combined modality treatment. Toxicity was seen in 42.55% of patients with febrile neutropenia in 21.27% and bleomycin lung in 11.76%. Overall till date 76.56% of patients on regular follow up are in CR Conclusions: Outcomes for pediatric Hodgkin's are promising despite late presentation to an Oncologist in our setup. Response rates with ABVD and non ABVD regimens are comparable but associated with different toxicities. P-092 Burkitt Lymhoma in a Boy with Cryptogeneic Cirrhosis: What is the Best Way to Treat? Z. Karakas 1, D. Tugcu1, A. Karagenc1, Atay3, S. S. Istanbul Medical Faculty, Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Istanbul, Turkey; 2Istanbul University Istanbul Medical Faculty, Pediatric Gastroenterology, Istanbul, Turkey; 3Istanbul University Istanbul Medical Faculty, Pediatric Intensive Care, Istanbul, Turkey; 4Istanbul University Istanbul Medical Faculty, Pediatric Infection, Istanbul, Turkey Background/Objectives: To describe an uncommon occurence of Burkitt lymphoma in a boy with cryptogeneic cirrhosis and discuss the treatment of lymphoma in the presence of liver failure. Design/Methods: A fifteenyearoldboy was first referred for a cervical mass.Medical history revealed that he has been under regular followup with the diagnosis of idiopathic cirrhosis for about 9 years.The pathologic diagnosis was Burkitt lymphoma(BL).He was evaluated as stage II and BFM NHL 2012 study protocol was began. Results: Hepatic failure developed after full dose prophase and two days 50% reduced AA block, and chemotherapy could not be continued. On 14 th day,he was transferred to Pediatric Intensive Care Unt due to hepatic and respiratory failure,massive ascites with diagnoses of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome,and sepsis.Klebsiella Pneumoniae was detected in hemoculture. After an effective treatment, he was retransferred to our clinic on 28 th day of therapy.Considering life threatening complications even after reduced dose chemotherapy,he was discussed at local tumor council and decided to continue with single six rituximab therapy.Complete remission was achieved just after the first course of rituximab. After the first cure,liver functions impaired and next rituximab could be given one month later.He is still in remission for BL with stable signs of chronic liver failure.He is a candidate for liver transplantation. He had alive donor for liver transplantation. The liver transplant council decided to follow up until the end of chemotherapy because the patient was stable. Conclusions: Burkitt lymphoma is very chemosensitive tumor with successful results with chemotherapy. But as in our case,in the presence of comcomitant liver failure, treatment of this wellknown tumor could be very difficult. Targeted therapies might be an effective alternative instead of conventional treatment protocols in such extraordinary presentations. P-093 Evaluation of Metabolic Tumor Volum and Total Lesion Glicolysis in Pediatric Hodgkn Lymphomas at Diagnosis and After Courses E. Carraro1, M.P. Unit, Padua, Italy; 3University Hospital of Padua, Nuclear Medicine Department, Padua, Italy Background/Objectives: Recent studies demonstrated how qualitative and semiquantitative measures, obtained with ad interim evaluation with positron emission tomography (PET), could predict the clinical response in patients with Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL). The aim of our study was to evaluate some semiquantitative PET measures to predict the response in pediatric patients with HL. Design/Methods: We measured the Standard Uptake Value (SUV)max, SUVpeak, Metabolic Tumor Volume (MTV) and Total Lesion Glicolysis (TLG) in the PET imagings obtained at staging and after 4 chemotherapy courses COPP/ABV or ABVD. Patients were treated according to the AIOEPLH2004 protocol. Patients were defined good responders (GR) if they were in complete remission (CR) at the end of followup, otherwise they were defined as noresponders (NR). Statistical analysis was performed with the MannWhitney test. Results: Ninetyfour PET datasets of 47 children were analyzed. Mean followup was 44 months. At the end of the followup 41 patients were in CR and only 6 were NR. All relapsed patients, or refractory to the first line therapy, suffered of Nodular Sclerosis HL stage III or IV. The PET imagings done at diagnosis showed a higher burden of disease in NR patients compared to GR patients: MTV (223 vs. 127, p =0.03) and TLG (891 vs. 614, p=0.04). Also SUVmax and SUVpeak were higher but without statistical significance. After 4 chemotherapy courses only TLG remain higher in PR group (9.3 vs. 5.1, p=0.04) while MTV was slightly higher in GR group (1.7 vs. 1.6, p=0.04). Conclusions: The MTV and TLG are two semiquantitative parameters that could predict the clinical response in patients with HL. A larger cohort study is needed to confirm these preliminaries data. P-094 Factors Associated with Time to Diagnosis of Childhood and Adolescent NonHodgkin Lymphoma in Peru M. Oscanoa 1 1hospital Nacional Edgardo Rebagliati, Oncology, Lima, Peru Background/Objectives: Time to diagnosis (TD) or \"lag time\" is the time between a patient's first symptom recognition to a diagnosis of cancer. Delayed TD allows tumor progression and poor outcome in NonHodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) in some studies, although it remains controversial. Objectives The aim of this study was to define clinical and sociodemographic factors associated to TD, which includes \"Parents delay\" (PD) and \"Medical delay\" (MD) in children and adolescents diagnosed with NHL in Lima, Peru. Design/Methods: A total of 46 patients younger than 18 years of age diagnosed with NHL between January 2012 and October 2016 were retrospectively evaluated. Clinical and demographic variables such as type of diagnosis, clinical stage, sex, age and parental characteristics were analyzed to evaluate their effects on TD, PD and MD. Results: Fortysix patients were included in the study. The median age was 10 years (range 317) and 68.5% were male. Histological subtypes were mature hydroavacciniformelike lymphoma in 5.7%. Stage III and IV tumors were seen in 77.2% of cases. The TD ranged between 2 weeks and 17.5 months (median, 8 weeks), with a median of PD and MD of 2 and 6 weeks, respectively. Among histological subtype, we could not found significant differences in TD. Age, parental age or level of education, metastatic disease, clinical stage and sex did not affect significantly TD. Conclusions: In our country, median TD was comparable to described in developing countries, where index of suspicion of childhood cancer remains low. It is necessary to establish strategies for optimizing early diagnosis based on associated factors. P-095 Epigenetic Silencing of the Tumor Suppressor Genes SPI1, PRDX2, and Ankara, Turkey; Yildirim Beyazit Research Hospital, Medical Genetics, Turkey; 3Gazi University Medical Faculty, Pediatrics, Ankara, Turkey; 4Gazi University Medical Faculty, Pathology, Ankara, Turkey; 5Gazi University Medical Faculty, Public Health, Ankara, Turkey Background/Objectives: The aim of the study was to investigate the expression and methylation status of seven distinctive genes with tumor suppressing properties in childhood and adolescent lymphomas. Design/Methods: A total of 96 patients with n=41), NonHodgkin Lymphoma (NHL, n=15), and proliferation (n=40, as controls) who were followedup between the years 20002015 at the Department of Pediatric Oncology are included in the research. The expression status of CDKN2A, SPI1, PRDX2, DLEC1, FOXO1, KLF4 and DAPK1 genes were with QPCR method after the RNA isolation from paraffin blocks of tumor tissue and cDNA conversion. DNA isolation was performed from samples with low gene expression followed by methylation PCR study specific to promotor regions of these genes in order to investigate the methylation patterns. Results: We found that SPI1, PRDX2, KLF4, DLEC1 andDAPK1 genes are significantly less expressed in the patients than the control group (p=0.0001). However, expression of CDKNA2 and FOXO1 genes in the patient and control groups were not statistically different. The methylation ratios of all genes excluding the CDKN2A and FOXO1 were significantly higher in the HL and NHL groups than the controls (p=0.0001). Conclusions: We showed that SPI1, PRDX2, genes are epigenetically silenced via hypermethylation in the tumor tissue samples of children with HL and NHL. Due to our finding that CDKN2A gene was not expressed in both of the patient and control groups, we concluded that it is not specific to malignancy. As FOXO1 gene was similarly expressed in both of the patient and control groups, its relation with malignancy could neither be found. Future studies may show if these genes will be candidates for biomarkers or therapeutic targets in childhood and adolescent lymphomas. *This study has been supported by a research grant of Turkish Pediatric Oncology Group (TPOG) P-096 Expert Consensus for Waldeyer's Ring Involvement in Pediatric Hodgkin Lymphoma J. Seelisch 1, J. Flerlage2, K. Kelly3, Children's Research Hospital, Cancer Institute, Hematology/Oncology, Buffalo, USA; 4University Hospital of Leipzig, Nuclear Medicine, 5MartinLutherUniversity Center, Hematology/Oncology, involvement in pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is a rare phenomenon of unclear definition. International pediatric HL specialists formed the WR working group of CAYAHL (Childhood, Adolescent, Young Adult HL). Existing literature was reviewed, cases were collected and consensus recommendations for WR involvement were established. Design/Methods: A systematic review was conducted for literature involving WR and HL. Results: 1499 titles/abstracts were reviewed, 75 papers at full text, and 24 included (8 pediatric). Nineteen further pediatric cases were collected from the group. Conclusions: Historically involvement of WR was determined by examination, ideally by ENT with biopsy confirmation. There are currently no standard clinical criteria to define involvement, rendering clinical evaluation highly subjective. Diagnostic, contrastenhanced CT and FDGPET are the standard of care for newly diagnosed HL. Review of both modalities is required to determine disease presence in WR given that normal/reactive lymphoid tissue may be avid on PET alone. Abnormality or asymmetry of both anatomy and metabolic activity should be assessed. Where PET avidity of WR structures approaches that of the primary mass, involvement should be considered. MRI is excellent for assessing head and neck tissues and should be considered for further delineation of PETCT findings. Indeterminate PET findings on initial staging that cannot be confirmed with CT/MRI should be reviewed with early response assessment. If metabolic activity normalizes at early response assessment, involvement is likely and should be considered in ongoing treatment. Tonsils can demonstrate physiologically increased metabolic activity making response assessment with FDGPET challenging. Thus, standard Deauville criteria cannot be applied. We suggest that the disappearance of asymmetric uptake and a symmetric uptake in palatine tonsils that does not markedly exceed (20%) the uptake of the adenoid region be considered adequate response. In clinical trials, final involvement should be determined by central review and a prospective database of WR involvement maintained. P-097 Clinical Characteristics and Treatment Outcome of Pediatric NonHodgkin Lymphoma in East Asia J.J. Seo 1 1Asan Medical Center, Pediatrics, Seoul, Republic of Korea Background/Objectives: Pediatric nonHodgkin lymphoma (pNHL) comprises a heterogeneous group of lymphoid neoplasms, and is known to have different aspects from adult disease and geographical differences in incidence. We performed this study to delineate the characteristics and outcomes of pNHL in East Asia. Design / Methods: Medical records of 749 patients with pNHL treated in 4 participating institutions of Beijing, Shanghai, Nagoya, Seoul, and in TPOG centers of Taiwan from January 2008 to December 2013 were reviewed retrospectively. Demographic and clinical features, survival outcomes and putative prognostic factors were analyzed. Results: Median age at diagnosis was 8 years. The most common pathologic subtype was cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (13%). Most patients (81%) had advanced disease at diagnosis. Bone marrow (BM) and CNS involvement were more frequently observed in BL and LL. The 5year overall survival and eventfree survival (EFS) rates were 89% and 84%, respectively at a median 50.5 months of follow up. 5year EFS rates were excellent in BL, LL and DLBCL (88, 88, 89%, respectively), and lower in ALCL and (P<0.001). CNS involvement, high LDH (>250 IU/mL) and advanced disease at diagnosis were associated with significantly poorer outcomes (P<0.05). Ninety one patients (12%) experienced relapse at median 8 months after diagnosis. Patients with ALCL and PTCL relapsed more frequently than other subtypes (P<0.001). Patients relapsed within 12 months from diagnosis, and relapsed BL and LL showed significantly poorer outcomes. Conclusions: The clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of pNHL in East Asian countries were similar to those observed in Western countries, but some peculiar clinical aspects were observed as well. This international study is expected to provide a platform for future collaborative study on NHL in East Asia. P-098 ZUCHS3, An Antibody Targeting B Lymphocytes, Is a Potential Therapeutic Agent for BLineage Malignancies H. Shen 1, S. Li1, Q. Shu1 1Children's Hospital Zhejiang University School of Medicine, HematologyOncology, Hangzhou, China Background/Objectives: Monoclonal antibody (mAb)based targeted therapy is one of the most promising strategies to cure cancers. ZUCHS3mAb was a novel antibody generated using hybridoma technique with human B lymphoma Raji cells immunogens in our laboratory, which presented potential to be a therapeutic agent for hematologic malignancies. Design/Methods: We investigated the reactivity profile of ZUCHS3mAb and identified the targeting antigen by flow cytometry. The internalization of ZUCHS3mAb was studied by the method applying papain digestion and flow cytometry. The capacity of ZUCHS3mAb specifically binding to S3Ag and activating complement was determined by complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). Results: The results showed that the antibody ZUCHS3mAb (murine IgG1) was a new clone of antiCD79a. It reacted with extracellular portion of CD79a protein. ZUCHS3 antigen was strictly expressed on Blineage lymphoma cells such as Burkitt's lymphoma, DLBCL and CLL cells from patients. ZUCHS3mAb was quickly internalized into the target cells once binding to the antigen. When the antibody was incubated with targeting cell Raji at 37\u00b0C, the degrees of internalization at into plasmid pcDNA3.1, and the recombinant plasmids encoding ZUCHS3mAb were transfected into CHO cells. The Western blotting analysis showed the culture supernatants bound to the extracts from Raji cells. The activities of CDC on Raji cells were in a dose dependent manner and the inhibition rates of Raji cells were 15.3%, 40.9%, respectively. Conclusions: ZUCHS3mAb is a novel antibody targeting extracellular portion of CD79a, which has the potential to be therapeutic agent in Children with Intestinal Transplants (ITX) K. Stanley 1, K. Soltys2, G. Bond2, G. Mazariegos2, S. Ranganathan3, R. Sindhi2 1Children's of Department of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Pittsburgh, USA; 2Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC, Department of Transplant Surgery, Pittsburgh, USA; 3Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC, Department of Pathology, Pittsburgh, USA Background/Objectives: Lymphocyte depleting induction immunosuppression decreases rejection severity and reduces maintenance immunosuppression requirements after ITx alone or with liver (LITx) in children. Whether PTLD rates vary with induction agent is unknown. Design/Methods: Retrospective chart review of subjects who received ITx from January 2000 through present at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC. Results: Of 193 ITx, 25 underwent alemtuzumab underwent rabbit antithymocyte globulin (rATG) induction. Alemtuzumabinduced subjects were older, compared with rATGinduced subjects with median age of 5 years (range <124) vs 3 years (range <122) (p=0.5, NS), experienced lower incidence of early (60day) acute cellular rejection (13/25 or 52% vs 96/147 or 65.3%, p=0.262, NS, 28% 20/147 exact). The alemtuzumab and rATG groups were similar with regards to liver containing grafts (4/25 or 16% vs 22/145 or 15%), year 16/20 57.1% intestine allograft (4/7 or 57.1% vs 11/20 or 55%). All subjects were treated with immunosuppression reduction. Within the alemtuzumab group, treatment also included rituximab in 4 and chemotherapy (with combination of cyclophosphamide and steroids) in 2 children, and enterectomy in 4 (3 from rejection/graft failure, 1 from PTLD). PTLD resolved in all of these subjects. One child died of infection. Within the rATG group, treatment included rituximab in 11 and chemotherapy in 6 children, and enterectomy in 7 (5 from rejection/graft failure, 2 from PTLD). Six children died: 3 due to PTLD, 2 of infection and 1 of renal failure. Conclusions: rATG induction is associated with a trend toward lower PTLD incidence compared with alemtuzumab. P-100 Minimal Disseminated Disease Evaluation TCell Centre for Treatment Research and Education in Cancer ACTREC Tata Memorial Centre TMC, Hematopathology Laboratory, Mumbai, India; 2Tata Memorial Hospital Background/Objectives: Tlymphoblastic lymphoma (TLBL) with (MDD) is defined as TLBL with <25% morphologically identifiable blasts in peripheral blood (PB) and/or bone marrow (BM) along with presence of BM involvement detected by flowcytometric immunophenotyping (FCMIPT). Published literature of this rare subgroup is sparse. This study aims at identifying MDD in TLBL using 10colour FCMIPT and study their clinical features. Design/Methods: A retrospective analysis of 40 children of TLBL (diagnosed on mediastinal and/or lymph node biopsy) with predominantly lymphomatous presentation and <25% blasts in PB/BM was done. Clinical and laboratory and FCMIPT data were studied. FCMIPT was performed on a 10color flowcytometer. Results: Mean age was 10.2 years (range:218 years). M:F ratio was 2.1:1. Mean hemoglobin, WBC platelet count were 12.7g/dl, 11.7x10^9/L and 411x10^9/L (142875) respectively. CSF examination was negative in all cases indicating rarity of CNS involvement in this subgroup. MDD was seen in 14 cases (35%) and ranged from 0.007% to 18.5% (mean:1.4%; median:1.2%). Mean (range) morphologically identifiable bone marrow blast/hematogones count in the group without MDD was 2.7% (14%) and in the group with Seven(50%) cases of TLBL with MDD showed <5% in BM indicating sensitivity and necessity of FCMIPT. PETCT was insensitive to identify MDD. Conclusions: MDD is in onethird(35%) of TLBL with <25% blasts in PB/BM. This underlines the importance of performing FCMIPT in cases with <25% blasts and even in cases of <5% blasts on morphology. Identification of minimal disseminated disease in TLBL is important as (1) limited published data are available, (2) these studies show inferior event free survival in TLBL with MDD as compared to patients without MDD and (3) there is a need for postinduction BM examination for residual disease detection in MDD positive cases and intensification of therapy if positive. P-101 Improved Outcome of Newly Diagnosed Childhood Mature BCell Lymphoma/Leukemia with High Tumor Burden Treated with Rituximab Combining BFM95Based Protocol: A Report from Shanghai, China Y. Fu 1, H. Wang1, X. zhai1, X. Qian1 1Children's Hospital of Fudan University, Hematology and oncology, Shanghai, China Background/Objectives: Rituximab has become a standard medicine in the treatment of adult patients with DLBCL. Currently, there was a limited number of clinical trials in children showing that rituximab can be combined with BFM and other protocols safely with good efficacy. The absence of similar study in China for childhood patients with newly diagnosed BNHL/BALL encouraged us to study the efficacy of rituximab in the Chinese population. Design/Methods: In this study, we explored the efficiency of rituximab in childhood BNHL. We found that 46 newly diagnosed mature BNHL which were stage III and stage IV/BAL children were treated with BFM95based protocol combined with rituximab. Compared with historical data of BFM90based protocol. Results: Our study recuited 35 males and 11 females with an average age of 6.9 years who were treated with R+BMF95 chemotherapy. Among the historical control of 23 patients treated with BFM90 chemotherapy, 5 were female. Compared with patients treated with BFM90 protocol, the 5year EFS of patients under R+BMF95 was higher (83.7\u00b15.7% vs 69.6%\u00b19.6% in R+BMF95 and BFM90 respectively) (P=0.11). Among subgroups of our patients, the 5year EFS of patients with stage III was 87.3\u00b16.1% vs 77.8\u00b19.8% (P=0.30), stage IV/BAL was 72.7%\u00b113.4% between patients treated with R++BMF95 and BFM90 respectively, these difference were not statistically significant neither. Among patients whose LDH level were <500 U/L at diagnosis, R+BFM95 protocol reached 100% survival during our followup, nevertheless the 5year EFS of patients in this group was not statistically different from that of patients treated with BFM90 (92.3\u00b17.4%, P=0.2994). Among patients had LDH >500 U/L the 5year EFS in R+BFM95 group was 77.2\u00b17.7% and significantly higher than that of BFM90 group (40.0\u00b115.5%, P=0.005). Conclusions: We found that rituximab has improved the eventfree survival (EFS) of childhood BNHL/BAL with LDH > Involvement and Central Nervous System (CNS) Disease: A Single Institution Case Series L. Amos 1, N. Wood1, M. Hetherington1, A. Hays1 1Children's Mercy Hospital, represents of childhood lymphomas. Leukemic and CNS involvement in ALCL is extremely rare. In addition, ALCL has rarely been reported in association with HLH. HLH is a lifethreatening disorder of immune dysregulation involving macrophage and Tcell activation with cytokine release causing multiorgan dysfunction. The objective of this case series is to report the disease course of two patients with fulminant HLH secondary to ALCL with leukemic and CNS involvement. Design/Methods: Here we present two patients that were admitted to our pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with multiorgan system failure requiring intubation and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) due to metabolic acidosis. Both met diagnostic and laboratory criteria for HLH. Both had bone marrow and peripheral blood evaluations with FISH analysis showing an ALK gene rearrangement, consistent with ALCL in leukemia phase. Patient 1 was a 2 year old male. He had a brain MRI done that showed numerous enhancing lesions consistent with metastasis. Patient 2 was a 16 year old female. Her CSF analysis showed evidence of disease with ALK positive cells. In addition, she was found to have non enhancing lesions in the deep white matter of her brain on MRI. Results: Both patients were treated with HLH directed therapy, followed by ALCL directed therapy. Both received additional treatment to the CNS with intrathecal chemotherapy. Patient 2 also received craniospinal irradiation (CSI). Both patients are off therapy and have no evidence of disease. Conclusions: This case series highlights two patients with the rare presentation of HLH associated ALCL with leukemic and CNS involvement. The diagnosis of HLH should be considered in ALCL patients presenting in the leukemic phase. This also suggests that the leukemic phase may lead to elevated cytokines that cause HLH. P-103 High Survival Rates in Hodgkin's Lymphoma in a Developing Country: No Mortality in Protocol Patients without A CO MORBID Problem N. Yazici 1, F. Sarialioglu1, Of Of Radiology, Of Pediatric Surgery, Adana, 6Baskent University, Department Of Nuclear Medicine, Adana, Turkey Background/Objectives: Different centers use different protocols according to their physical conditions in Turkey for Hodgkin's lymphoma. Usually choice of protocol depends on success and superiority of survival in original regimen. However local factors are different and it is impossible to take same results. In this study, treatment results of German Pediatric OncologyHematology Hodgkin's Disease 95 (GPOHHD95) regimen are presented. Design/Methods: In our department, PET/BT is routinely used in staging of every patient before and at the end of chemotherapy. GPOHHD regimen is used in its original version and radiotherapy had been used in involved fields (https://doi.org/10.1200/JCO.2012.45.3266). Patients were hospitalized for minimum 7 days at diagnosis for adaptation to treatment. The rest of treatment was continued in outpatient basis. Results: Between January 2006 -December 2015 there were 42 patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma. Thirty three of them were untreated. Mean age was 11,4 years (2,816,6 years); there were 23 males. Seventeen of them were mixed cellular type, There were 15 cases of risk group (RG)1; 10 of them were RG2, and 8 of them were RG3. Median follow up was 55.6 months. A patient with RG1 and stage 2A Hodgkin disease at diagnosis had a relapse at 50th month of follow up. He is still under follow up in second remission for a year. A patient with ataxia telengiectasia which had been exitus with pulmonary complications was excluded. There was no mortality in our series of protocol patients. Eventfree and overall survival for 5 years were % 95,5 and %100 respectively. Conclusions: The results of the GPOHHD95 protocol in our center were as successful as the original protocol despite local factors. We think that treatment related toxicity should be reduced with some modifications in our patients such as omitting radiotherapy in complete metabolic response with PET/CT after chemotherapy without procarbazine in male patients. P-104 Role of Surgery in Management of Paediatric Abdominal Lymphoma O. Zakaria 1 1King Faisal University, College Of Medicine, Al Ahsa, Saudi Arabia Background/Objectives: BACKGROUND: The abdomen is one of the most frequent sites for lymphoma in children. The role of surgery has been limited to intraabdominal resectable tumours or as a diagnostic procedure in case of disseminated disease. Laparotomy without total excision of the tumour does not improve survival; moreover, it may cause complications and delays initiation of chemotherapy. AIM OF THE WORK: This study was undertaken to assess the role of surgery in the management of children and adolescents presenting with intraabdominal lymphoma in order to create certain criteria to select the proper surgical modality for managing those patients. Design/Methods: PATIENTS AND METHODS: This caseseries, retrospective study was done on 83 patients of abdominal lymphoma over a period of seven years from 2000 to 2015. Patients' files were reviewed regarding the full clinical examinations, laboratory and radiological investigations as well as surgical and diagnostic procedures. Collected data were tabulated and statistically analyzed using SPSS program package. Results: Twenty seven patients (32.5%) presented with huge pelviabdominal mass and 27 (32.5%) had generalized lymphadenopathy beside their abdominal affection. The remaining 29 (35%) patients presented with symptoms of an acute abdomen. A total of 38 laparotomies were done. 27 patients underwent emergency laparotomy for acute abdomen and 10 patients had elective abdominal exploration. Lymph node biopsies were taken in 18 patients and laparoscopy procedures were performed in 8 patients as a diagnostic tool. Out of the total 83, the remaining 20 patients underwent true cut needle biopsy for diagnosis of their disease. Conclusions: Surgery still has a role in treatment of lymphoma whether non Hodgkin or Hodgkin's. However, in disseminated metastatic disease, aggressive debulking of the tumour should be avoided as chemotherapy is to be instituted primarily. Surgical resection does not cause significant change in morbidity or mortality. P-105 Abnormalities of the Thyroid in Survivors of Childhood Hodgkin's Disease D. Zvyagintseva 1, S. Kuleva2, Novikov3 1NN Petrov Research Research of Oncology Institute, Department of chemotherapy and combined treatment of malignant tumors in children, Saint Petersburg, Russia; 2N.N. Petrov Research Institute of Oncology, Department of chemotherapy and combined treatment of malignant tumors in children, Saint Petersburg, Russia; 3N.N. Petrov Research Institute of Oncology, Department of chemotherapy and combined treatment of malignant tumors in children, St. Petersburg, Russia Background/Objectives: Overall 5year survival rate for childhood Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) is now around 9095%, therefore late sequelae of treatment, especially endocrine diseases, have become more important. Aims: to investigate the late side effects of childhood Hodgkin's lymphoma therapy on the thyroid gland among childhood cancer survivors. Design/Methods: This report analyzed the function of the thyroid gland in 78 patients successfully treated in childhood with HD, according to two different protocols of therapy. The patients were divided into three groups depending on the treatment: group 1 riskadapted therapy according DALHD protocol (n=42), group 2 riskadapted therapy SPbHL protocol (n=86), and BEACOPP + radiotherapy (RT) (n=15). The treatment methods correlated with the appearance of thyroid dysfunction. Results: After median followup of 7.5 years, thyroid dysfunction was detected in 20 of 78 patients (25.6%). The thyroid abnormalities were: hypothyroidism (n= 16, [1] ervical irradiation and 39 Gy doses of radiation were found to constitute risk factors for thyroid abnormalities. Conclusions: This study confirms the high incidence of thyroid abnormalities in patients treated for Hodgkin's lymphoma with combination therapy of chemotherapy with head/neck/thorax radiotherapy and strengthens the importance of a longterm followup. P-106 Treatment Outcomes of Adolescents with 1, S. Kulyova2, S. Research Research of Oncology Institute 2 SaintPetersburg State Pediatric Medical University, Department of chemotherapy and combined treatment of malignant tumors in children, Saint Petersburg, Russia; 2NN Petrov Research Research of Oncology Institute, Department of chemotherapy and combined treatment of malignant tumors in children, St. Petersburg, Russia Background/Objectives: Survival rates after a diagnosis of Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) have improved substantially over the past 40 years. But adolescents who are between 10 and 17 years old seem to experience poorer survivals. Objective: To provide a descriptive review and improve our understanding of the treatment outcome of Hodgkin's lymphoma. Design/Methods: A retrospective review of 106 patients aged 1017 years old with HL treated at our institution from 19962014 was performed. Survival analysis was performed using the KaplanMeier method. Results: Median age was 13.8 years, 44% were boys, and 56% were girls. Fortythree patients (41%) had III stage, 63 patients (59%) had advanced disease (IIIIV stage). About half of patients (46 or 43%) had a Bstage disease. The majority patients (84 or 79%) had nodular sclerosis, 4 patients (4%) the lymphocyte predominance 12 (12%) mixed cellularity, in 6 cases (6%) morphological type was not diagnosed. Patients were treated with riskadapted therapy (chemotherapy and radiation) according to DALD (40 or 39%) or SPbHL (56 or 54%) protocols. Seven (7%) patients were treated with BEACOPP. The radiation dose ranged from 20 to 35 Gy. The 5years overall survival was 89,5\u00b13,4%, diseasefree survival was was 85,7\u00b14%, 81\u00b15% 76,9\u00b14,6%, respectively. Conclusions: The presenting features of adolescents with HL and efficiency in this study were better than at young adult (overall survival was 83%) but it is worse than at children (overall survival was 95%). Adolescent's Hodgkin's lymphoma is very curable diseases but require a personalized management in oncohematological units. P-107 Prognostic Factors of Young Adults Hodgkin's 2, Petrov Research Research of Oncology Institute 2 SaintPetersburg State Pediatric Medical University, Department of chemotherapy and combined treatment of malignant tumors in children, Saint Petersburg, Russia; 2NN Petrov Research Research of Oncology Institute 2 SaintPetersburg State Pediatric Medical University, Department of chemotherapy and combined treatment of malignant tumors in children, ST. PETERSBURG, Russia; 3NN Petrov Research Research of Oncology Institute, Department of chemotherapy and combined treatment of malignant tumors in children, St. Petersburg, Russia Background/Objectives: Hodgkin's lymphoma is approximately 12% of all malignant tumors in patients aged 1929. The riskadapted treatment program in this group is not used. The aim of the study was to identify prognostic unfavorable factors in young adults with HL. Design/Methods: The study included data of 87 patients aged 19 to 29 years (the average age was 24 \u00b1 4 years). Thirtyfour (39.1%) was men, 53 was women (60.9%), sex ratio 1: 1.6. Fortyseven patients (54%) had III stage, 40 patients (46%) had advanced disease (IIIIV stage). More than half of patients (47 or 54%) had a Bstage disease. The majority patients (76 or 87.4%) had nodular sclerosis, 2 patients (2.3%) the lymphocyte predominance 5 (5.7%) mixed cellularity, in 4 cases (4.6%) morphological type was not diagnosed. All patients received from 2 to 11 cycles of primary chemotherapy (median of 4 cycles) with ABVD (48 patients, or 55.2%), BEACOPP (36 or 41,4%), MOPP (2 or 2.3%), and COPP (one patient) following radiation in 57 patients (65.5%). The radiation dose ranged from 20 to 51 Gy. Results: Correlation matrix included 35 factors. Significant impact on overall and eventfree survival was had stage IV disease (p = 0.035813), extranodal lesion (p = 0.002746), the involvement of the pericardium (p = 0.039394), the value of ESR 35 mm / h (p = 0.012357), white blood cell count more 11,5x109 / l (p = 0.026490), the level of lymphocytes less than 9% (p = 0.001053), fibrinogen value of more than 7.5 g / l (p = 0.048856), the effectiveness of therapy (p = 0.000789) and the volume of tumor more than 210 cm3 / m2 (p = 0.017734). Conclusions: Using the identified unfavorable prognostic factors, it is possible to stratified patients on risk groups and to determine the treatment program. P-108 Thyroid Abnormalities in Survival of Childhood Hodgkin's Lymphoma D. Zvyagintseva 1, Semiglazova1 1N.N. Petrov Research Institute of Oncology, Department of chemotherapy and combined treatment of malignant tumors in children, Saint Petersburg, Russia Background/Objectives: Longterm side effects of treatment modalities for childhood Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) are focused in modern researches. Thyroid dysfunction has been reported especially following head and neck irradiation. Aims: to determine the critical cutoff point of radiation dose on neck and thyroid gland in children and adolescents with Hodgkin's lymphoma for predictive dosimetric variables with the Youden method. Design/Methods: One hundred and fortythree patients with proved HL (aged 2 17 years) were included in the study. The patients were divided into three groups depending on the treatment: group 1 riskadapted therapy according DALHD protocol (n=42), group 2 riskadapted therapy SPbHL protocol (n=86), and BEACOPP + radiotherapy (RT) (n=15). Eligibility criteria for inclusion in the current analysis were: diagnosis of the cancer at age 18 years, treatment with chemotherapy and RT (neck/thorax) and a time interval of 6 months after completion of the therapy. Thyroid function tests, thyroid gland ultrasound examinations were evaluated in this groups. Results: The mean followup period was 7,5 years (range: 022). One hundred twentysix patients (88.1%) of 143 received a total dose of 1546 Gy head/neck/thorax RT. A cutoff point at 39 Gy of radiation dose on neck and thyroid gland in children and adolescents with Hodgkin's lymphoma for predictive dosimetric variables was found. The ROC curve area was 0.717 \u00b1 0.108 (CI 0.5900.822), p = 0.0445. The maximum index was 0.3929. Conclusions: Total dose of 39 Gy on neck and thyroid gland was the critical cutoff values for the development of thyroid dysfunction. P-109 Linear Regression Model \"Bulky Disease\" of Hodgkin Lymphoma in Adolescents D. 1, S. Karitsky1 1NN Petrov Research Institute of Oncology SaintPetersburg State Pediatric Medical University St. Petersburg Russia, Department of children`s chemoterapy and combined modality therapy, Saint Petersburg, Russia Background/Objectives: The predictive value of Hodgkin's lymphoma tumor burden has been discussed for about 20 years. However, the evidence based on modern research, has become possible to use only in recent years. The purpose of the study was assessment of influence of relative tumor burden on longterm outcomes. Design/Methods: The study included data on 106 patients aged from 10 to 18 years old (middle age of 14 years) with biopsyproved Hodgkin lymphoma. Boys were 44%, girls were 56%. Thirtyeight patients (35.8%) had II stage and thirtynine (36.8%) had III stage of the disease. B symptoms occurred in 46 patients (43.4%). In 66 patients (62.3%) were identified the bstage disease. All patients were treated according to pediatric protocols: 40 (38.8%) patients according to DALHD, and 56 (54.3%) according to SPBLH program. Seven teenagers (6.8%) were treated according to BEACORP scheme. Chemotherapy regimen was followed by extend or involvedfield or subtotal radiation with doses from 20 to 51 Gy in 68 patients (66%). Results: Overall survival at 5 years was 91% (range 8993%), diseasefree survival was 88% (8591%). The optimum cutoff level according ROC method for relative tumor burden has been established at 122.7 cm3/m2. The ROC curve area was 0.717, p = 0.00010. The maximum Youden index was 0.4113. Overall survival in the cohort of patients with this volume and above was 69.6%, with a tumor volume of less than 122.7 cm3/m2, overall survival was 97.2% (p = 0.00002). Conclusions: The relative tumor burden is the parameter which is significantly changing survival rates in adolescents with Hodgkin lymphoma. The determinate can be intercorrelated and included from the final multifactor analysis.

Esiashvili1 1Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Department of Radiation Oncology, Atlanta, USA; 2Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Department of Biostatistics & Bioinformatics, Atlanta, USA Background/Objectives: To evaluate factors associated with acute kidney injury (AKI) in pediatric patients after total body irradiation (TBI) based myeloablative conditioning for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Design/Methods: The records were reviewed for 129 consecutive pediatric patients (range, 121 years) who underwent TBIbased myeloablative conditioning for hematologic malignancies at a single institution between January 2003 and May 2014. TBI total dose ranged from 10.514Gy and TBI doserate ranged from 5.5720.85cGy/min. AKI was defined as a doubling of the baseline creatinine in the first 100 days after TBI. Univariate and multivariable analyses were performed to determine associations between variables. Results: AKI developed in 96 patients (74.4%). TBI total dose (P=0.095), dose rate (P=0.680), and dose per fraction (P=0.373) were not significant predictors for AKI. For chemotherapy, 99.2% of patients received a regimen containing Cytoxan. AKI was not increased with the additions of AraC (P=0.156), VP16 (P=0.428), acute GVHD (P=0.874) were associated with increased AKI. AKI was not increased in patients with a low preTBI glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (P=0.561). The majority of patients with AKI had normalization of their creatinine after HSCT (67.9%), however, persistent renal dysfunction after TBI was associated with a higher incidence of transplant related mortality (TRM) (P<0.001) and worse overall survival (OS) (P<0.001), both of which remained significant on multivariable analysis (P<0.001). Conclusions: A high incidence of AKI was noted in this series. Despite this, no significant factors were identified as agents that increase the incidence of AKI in this series and other variables must be identified as potential causes of AKI. AKI did not appear to result in longterm renal damage in the majority of patients; however, persistent renal dysfunction was associated with worse OS and TRM. Additional attention must be paid to factors that facilitate normalization of kidney function after AKI. P-111 Basiliximab is well Tolerated and Effective in the Treatment of SteroidRefractory Acute Gut GraftVersusHost Disease After Pediatric Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation F. Ansari 1 1FMRI Gurgaon, pediatric and India Background/Objectives: BackgroundAntiCD(25) monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) have been evaluated for the treatment of steroidrefractory acute graftnegativersushost disease (GVHD) in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) mainly in adults after matched donors for years, but there is paucity of data in pediatric patients. Aims and Objective To evaluate the efficacy of the chimeric Mab, basiliximab in pediatric patients with steroidrefractory acute gut after matched and haploidentical HSCT. Design/Methods: Material and MethodsBasiliximab was evaluated in 11 patients with steroidrefractory acute gut GVHD after matched and haploidentical SCT. Patients were transplanted from a matched sibling (n = 3) or haploidentical (n =8) donor because of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 4), acute myeloid leukemia (n = 2), fanconi anemia (n = 2), thalassemia (n = 2) and immunodeficiency (n = 1). Basiliximab was given at a dose of 2 x 10 mg (<40kg) and 2 x 20 mg(>40kg) on 2 consecutive days after steroidrefractory acute gut GVHD had developed. Basiliximab was repeated on day 8 in cases of persistent GVHD. A median of four basiliximab infusions (range 212) were given to these patients. Results: ResultsNone had infusionassociated or cytokinerelated sideeffects after basiliximab. patients (72.7 %) responded to basiliximab, 5/11 (45.4%) had a complete response (CR) of acute gut GVHD and 3/11 (27.2%) had a partial response (PR). Three of 11 patients (27%) did not respond. Conclusions: ConclusionThese data suggested that basiliximab was effective to treat steroidrefractory acute gut GVHD after pediatric matched/haploidentical SCT P-112 Bone Marrow Transplantation in Pediatric Population; 15 Year Experience from Single Centre S.H. Ansari 1 1National Institute of Blood Diseases and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Haematology Bone Marrow Transplantation, karachi, Pakistan Background/Objectives: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) as a rescue procedure in patients with malignant & non malignant disorders treated with cytotoxic regimens in patients with aberrant, or defective hematopoietic cells, including marrow failure and autoimmune disorders. In both situations, however, HSCT also has therapeutic effects to eradicate the patients disease. The objective of the study was to assess the outcome of bone marrow transplantation in pediatric population with malignant and non malignant hematological disorders. Design/Methods: A total of 205 pediatric patients underwent transplantation between January 2000 and December 2014 at National Institute of Blood Diseases and Bone Marrow Transplantation for various hematological disorders, both malignant and nonmalignant. Both Haematopoietic Stem cells as well as peripheral blood transplantation methods were employed. For allogenic transplantaion, HLAmatched siblings were the donors. Two years posttransplant survival was calculated using KaplanMeier survival function. Results: The mean followup period was 301 \u00b1 265 days. Acute episodes of graft versus host disease(GvHD) were observed in 11% and chronic GvHD in 7% of the patients. Overall survival among patients undergoing stem cell transplantation during past five years was 70%. Six months Disease free survival was 42% in aplastic anemia (AA), 69.1% in Beta malignancies and 45.4% in Fanconis anemia. Conclusions: In this study the overall survival among patients undergoing stem cell transplantation during past five years was 70% with the less incidence of acute and chronic GvHD reported from other parts of the world. P-113 Outcome of Children with Cancer and/or Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in the Intensive Care Unit: Experience at a Large European Pediatric Cancer Center C. Barking 1, K. Masjosthusmann2, G. Rellensmann2, K. Ehlert1, S. Z\u00f6llner1, Controlling, Muenster, Germany Background/Objectives: Pediatric cancer treatment and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) carry considerable risks of morbidity. We analyzed intensive care unit (ICU) admissions in children and adolescents treated for cancer or undergoing HSCT who developed lifethreatening complications. Design/Methods: Patients 21 years with hematological or oncological disorders or status post allogeneic HSCT receiving care at the Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology admitted to the ICU between 2003 and 2013 for lifethreatening conditions were identified through a search of the University Hospital\u00b4s Medical Controlling database. Demographics, disease related parameters, medical course during the ICU stay, short and longterm outcome were analyzed. Causes of death and parameters with potential impact on outcome were analyzed by uni and multivariate analysis. Results: During the study period, 140 patients had 188 admissions to the ICU for a lifethreatening medical condition. The majority of patients (60.6%) had a hematological malignancy, and 38.3% were post allogeneic HSCT; the median age was 10.4 years (range, 0.0- 20.5). Main reasons for ICU admission were respiratory insufficiency 45.2%), cardiovascular insufficiency (52; 27.7%) Mortality in the ICU was 19.1% (36) and related to organ failure and acute complications (28; 77.8%) or irreversible progress of the underlying malignancy (8; 22.2%). Mortality rates at 30, 100 and 365 days post discharge from the ICU were 24.5%, 30.9%, and 39.9%, respectively. Parameters significantly associated with death in the ICU included status post allogeneic HSCT, prior ICU admission(s), the number of days in the ICU, the presence of infections, occurrence and number of organ failures and the number of supported organ systems. Conclusions: The outcome of pediatric cancer/HSCT patients admitted for acute, lifethreatening conditions was not as dismal as reported for some centers in the literature. Most patients benefitted from ICU care and survival was predominantly compromised by the evolution of complications. P-114 Various Ebstein Barr Virus Manifestation in Children after Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation from Unrelated Donors W. Czogala 1, J. Gozdzik1,2, M. Wozniak1, A. A. Hospital of Krakow, Transplantation Department, Krakow, Poland; 2Jagiellonian University Medical College, Department of Immunology Chair of Clinical Immunology and Transplantation, Krakow, Poland Background/Objectives: Epstein - Barr Virus (EBV) infections remain to be a considerable reason of severe complications in patients after allogeneic stem cell transplantation from unrelated donors (MUD HST). Clinical status of these complications vary from negligible viraemia to life - threatening PTLD. Design/Methods: There have been 85 MUDHST performed on our Transplantation Ward from 2007 to 2015 in children aged from 1 to 20 years. Clinical infection status was examined every 7 days by realtime PCR in blood serum. Other body fluids or/and tissues were examined in case the clinical disease status was unclear. Results: Escalating EBV replication was confirmed in 28 (33%) patients. EBV infection after MUD - HST developed as: primary infection (3 patients), EBV reactivation (17), probable EBV disease (5), confirmed EBV disease (1) and posttransplant lympheproliferative disease (PTLD) (2). Reduction of immunosuppressive drugs was implemented as a first choice procedure in case of non - symptom EBV infection after MUD - HST. When subsequent replications or clinical development occured, rituximab (1 to 8 doses) was implemented. In 27 cases such treatment was successful. In 2 cases (one with confirmed disease and one with PTLD) there was a low DNA virus detection in blood, yet it coexisted with a massive EBV replication in tonsil tissue. In one case of PTLD with lymphatic tissue of the throat involvement we observed treatment resistance and chemotherapy was added to treatment. In this case there was a non significant and variable viraemia detection, while tonsils remained infected. The boy died regardless to treatment. Conclusions: Systematic virus replication development monitoring is an effective PTLD prophylaxis. Low viraemia detection does not exlude tissue involvement and in presence of suspected symptoms diagnostics should be enlarged. P-115 Unmanipulated Stem Cell Transplantation with POS Transplantation Cyclophosphamide. An Excellent Alternative in Latinoamerican Population M. Perez Garcia 1, A. OLAYA VARGAS1, G. LOPEZ HERNANDEZ1, N. Ramirez de 3700C, bone marrow transplantation, Mexico City, Mexico Background/Objectives: As the chance of finding a HLA genotypically identical sibling donor is 25%. Unrelated donnor is not available at our country yet. Cord blood stem cell source is limited by dose. The use of high dose pos transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCY) introduced by the Baltimore group approximately 10 years ago has been rapidly adopted worldwide. Manipulated haploidentical stem cell transplantation (ex vivo) have demonstrated good results. Several studies achieved 2 year overall survival from 4070% and 4 year OS 3646%, and GVHD incidence from 47%.80% Objective: To determinate feasibility and overall survival with pos transplantation cyclophosphamide. Design/Methods: Prospective, longitudinal study was performed All patients with ALL in CR2 lacked 1) Matched Sibling Donor 2) Umbilical cord blood units with nucleated cells 4\u00d710 7 /kg recipient body weight and 4/6 HLA matched antigen with molecular typing. The order preference of donor selection was a) mother b) father c) brother or sister. Patients with any severe condition were not elegible. This study was aproved by Investigation Comitee and written informed consent was obtained from parental guardians of all patients and donors Results: Forty patients were elegible: Age 0.617.9 years. 68% male and 22% female. CD34 dose were 212 \u00d710e6/kg. Median of day for neutrophil graft was 15.7 (1035 days). Primary failure was 10%. Three years Overall survival was 65%, Acute Graft versus host disease was 35% and chronic graft versus host disease 20% Incidence of viral infection was 15%: adenovirus, cytomegalovirus and BK virus were common and Immune reconstituci\u00f3n shows a delay of CD4+ and CD8+ delay, until 1 year postransplantation Conclusions: PTCy is an option at our country to face lack of unrelated donor and umbilical cord blood with good dose. It\u00b4s a factible procedure. More studies should be achieved in order to demonstrate the better source P-116 Haploidentical Transplantation with T Cell Depletion for Systemic Relapses of Aggressive Pediatric Solid Tumors E. Ramos Elbal 1, M. Plaza Fornieres2, J.P. Mu\u00f1oz El Spain Background/Objectives: The prognosis after systemic relapse (SR) of aggressive pediatric solid tumors is poor. After haploidentical stem cell transplantation (HaploSCT), with ex vivo T depletion, alloreactive NK cells may exert an antitumor effect. We analyzed the procedure and results of HaploSCT in six patients (6 to 15 years old) with SR of Ewing sarcoma (ES, 3), neuroblastoma (2) and osteosarcoma (1). Design/Methods: Three patients (2 ES, 1 osteosarcoma) were in second complete remission (2CR) after resection of lung metastases and second line chemotherapy and 3 had active disease. Donor selection (parents) was based on KIR and KIRligand genotyping (donor and recipient) and KIR expression (donor) by flow cytometry. Ex vivo manipulation of the graft consisted of double CD3+/CD19+ (2) or CD3+/CD19+ (4) depletion. The conditioning consisted of fludarabine, busulfan and thiotepa (5) or radioactive ATG graftnegativersushost disease was done with mycophenolate (1) or cyclosporine and methotrexate (5). Results: infused. Graft failure occurred in two patients (CD3+/CD19+ depletion), and both were rescued with matched HLA sibling allograft. No patient died from complications of HaploSCT, one developed acute grade III/IV, steroidresistant GVHD responding to photopheresis. Four patients suffered tumor progression and died 3 to 12 months after HaploSCT. Two patients with ES in 2CR at transplantation are alive and disease free 51 and 60 months after HaploSCT, respectively. Conclusions: HaploSCT was a safe option for these heavily pretreated patients with no treatmentrelated mortality in our series. Graft rejection was associated with CD3+ depletion but not with CD3+ depletion. Only patients transplanted in 2CR have a real chance for longterm diseasefree survival. P-117 High Dose Chemotherapy (HDCT) and Autologous Stem Cell Transplant (ASCT) in Childhood Cancer Experience from the Royal Marsden Hospital N. Roy Moulik 1, J. Vaidya1 Paediatric Oncology, London, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: High dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT)form an integral part of treatment protocols for some of the childhood cancers and is being increasingly used for relapsed and refractory solid tumours as well as brain tumours and lymphomas in children.The clinical course and complications of autologous transplant for childhood cancers between 2010 and 2017 is described. Design/Methods: In this retrospective study all children undergoing high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant between January 2010 and March 2017 were included. Relevant data were retrieved from patient records and analysed using conventional statistics. Results: Eightytwo children (M:F 8:9) with a mean age of 5.2\u00b14.4 years underwent ASCT for various cancers, most commonly neuroblastoma (47%).Neutrophil and platelet engraftment after ASCT were seen after 13.6\u00b12.9 and 27.3\u00b115.6 days respectively. Platelet recovery was longer in patients with neuroblastoma receiving BuMel conditioning compared to other diagnosis (p<0.001).Common complications included mucositis (100%) and febrile neutropenia (90%). Culture positive sepsis was seen in 17(20.7%) cases whereas 42 (51%) patients needed parenteral nutrition for mucositis. Hepatic and renal dysfunction were observed in 33 (43.4%) and 4 (4.7%) of cases respectively. Hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) was seen in 14(17%)patients; of which 13 had Busulfan based conditioning. Median duration of parenteral nutrition and antibioticswere 8(035) and 9(028) days respectively.Twelve(14%) patients needed escalation of care to HDU/PICU for sepsis (8) or SOS (4). Mean duration of hospitalisation was 30.5\u00b18.7 days and was significantly different among various conditioning regimens (p<0.001).There was no transplant related mortality within Day+100 following ASCT. Conclusions: Complications of ASCT in childhood cancer occurring during the period of cytopenia between conditioning and engraftment are frequently related to the underlying diagnosis and conditioning regimen. Despite commonly occurring complications the immediate outcome for ASCT is excellent with optimum supportive care. P-118 PsychoAffective Implications in Pediatric Hematopoietic StemCell Transplantation. A QualitativeQuantitative Study F. Sinatora 1, A. N. Di Florio1, Porreca1, Health, Padova, Italy; 2University of Padua, Department of Developmental Psychology and Socialisation, Padova, Italy Background/Objectives: Only few studies have focused on the analysis of quantitative and qualitative data in patients undergoing HSCT during childhood (Bingen et al., 2012). The aim of the study was to investigate the perception of illness experience in patients, survivors and their families, and to correlate quantitative and qualitative data. Design/Methods: Three different populations answered an openended single question about disease experience by writing a brief composition. Group_A, tested before transplantation and after a year, included patients, parents and siblings. Group_B was composed of pediatric HSCT survivors, parents and siblings, and Group_B_over included adult survivors, at least 5 years after pediatric transplantation. The Child Behavior Checklist 618 (Achenbach and Rescorla, 2001) and the 36Item Short Form Health Survey (Ware et al, 2000) were also administered. The TLAB (Ver. 8.1.4, Lancia, 2012) was used for qualitative analyses. Results: Semantic differences in Group A indicate that the disruption of familiar unity and the way the disease is faced have a major impact on the mental health of family members. Despite 5 years from HSCT, in the second group, the theme of familiar disruption, as well as the inability to refer directly to the disease and to the fear of death are associated with clinical scores in the scales considered. The third group shows significant differences with respect to gender and the type of transplant. Conclusions: Results seems to suggest that clinicians should take into account the impact that the disease and HSCT could have on mental health, during all the phases of care. Moreover, the care approach should focus attention on how the disease affects the whole family and relationships between its members. P-119 Pediatric Haploidentical Transplant: An Indian Experience N. Singh 1 1FMRI Gurgaon, Pediatric Hematoncology and Stem cell transplant, Gurgaon, India Background/Objectives: BackgroundOut of an estimated 20,000 patients requiring an Allogeneic HSCT in India, only 500 odd patients receive one. Keeping in cognizance the resource constraints, the major reason for the discordance lies in the lack of alternate donors. Whilst unrelated donor marrow and cord suffice for the ethnic majorities in Europe and the USA, such registries provide for less than 10% of HSCT recipients due to both cost and an available match. Aims and ObjectiveTo initiate a Pediatric Haploidentical Family Donor HSCT program in our Institute. Design / Methods: Material and MethodsWe chose a Posttransplant Cyclophosphamide (PTCY) based approach in all except one in which TCR alpha beta CD 19 depletion was used with PBSC as the graft source. We have carried out 22 transplants in 20 patients over the last 3 years (AML7; ALL6; PTCY on days 3 and 4 followed by cyclosporine/tacrolimus and MMF except one. The conditioning regimen comprised of Fludarabine/Busulphan/Melphalan(AML),Fludarabine/Thiotepa/Melphalan(ALL),Fludarabine/Cyclo/TBI(FA), Fludarabine /Busulphan/ATG(Thalassemia). Results: Results16/20 patients surviving beyond 21 days had successful engraftment with full donor Chimerism, 2 patients undergoing a second Haploidentical HCT engrafted as well. Acute GVHD grade 24 developed in 7/20 patients. Day 100 NRM was 6/20 (30%) and the overall survival at 1 year was 70%. The major cause of NRM was infection with Gram Negative Bacilli accounting for 70% of the deaths. Chronic GVHD occurred in 14% of the evaluable patients. With stringent monitoring for CMV and preemptive therapy, none succumbed to CMV disease Conclusions: ConclusionHaploidentical HCT based on PTCY and PBSC graft is feasible and probably the most viable form of alternate donor HCT in resource constrained settings. P-120 Allogenic Hematopoeitic Stem Cell Transplant for High Risk Acute Pediatric Leukemia: Single Center Experience from India V. khandelwal 1, D. choudhary1, S. sharma1, D. Haematology, Delhi, India Background/Objectives: To the outcome of allogenic hematopoeitic stem cell transplant(HSCT) for High Risk Acute Pediatric Leukemia. Design/Methods: 42 transplants were done for 41 patients over period of 4 years; Median age 16 years (range 321). The diagnosis was: acute lymphoblastic leukemia in 26(63%) patients, acute myeloid leukemia14(34%), and acute Promyelocytic Leukemia in one. 33% were in first remission (CR1), 40% in second (CR2), and 27 %in disease (CR3). Transplant type: GVHD Tacrolimus/MMF in 9, and Tacrolimus/MMF in 2 patients. Results: Out of 42 transplants, 5 received bone marrow, 37 received G CSF mobilized peripheral blood stem cells. A median 7 million of CD34+ cells/kg was infused. A total of 39 transplants (93%) engrafted. Median time for Neutrophil and platelet engraftment was 11 days and 17 days respectively. Seven patient developed hemorrhagic cystitis.Acute GVHD (GR II - IV) was seen in 12(29%) and chronic GVHD in 3 patients. CMV reactivation was seen in 5 patients. Chimerism at day + 100 was available in 25(60%) cases; all of them had full donor hematopoiesis. Primary rejection was seen in 2 and secondary rejection in 1 patient. Fourteen patients(34%) died, the causes were; relapse (n: 7), Infection (n: 4), GVHD (n: 3).Median follow up period was 260 days with overall survival (OS) for the whole group 66%. Discriminated OS according to remission status was 71% in risk leukemia shows encouraging results.PTCy based haploidentical HSCT is also one option in developing countries and is cost effective. P-121 Outcomes of Refractory and Relapsed Hodgkin's Lymphoma with Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation: A Single Institution Experience R. Wali Patrus1, Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) is the most common cancer in children, adolescents and young adults with a peak incidence between the ages of 20 and 34. The overall survival (OS) rate of newly diagnosed HL is approximately 80-90%. However, a subset of these patients with HL has refractory disease to first line therapies or experience disease relapse. For these patients, conventional salvage therapies and autologous stem cell transplant is often considered the standard of care. Our analysis reports outcomes in these patients. Design/Methods: A retrospective analysis was done on patients with Hodgkin's Lymphoma who had refractory or relapsed disease at Shaukat Khanum Hospital from September 2009 till December 2013 after IRB approval. Patients who had high dose chemotherapy followed by stem cell rescue were selected for this analysis. Results: A total of 567 patients were registered at the Hospital. Sixty (10.6%) of the patient had either Primary Progressive/Refractory disease or Relapse after finishing with first line chemotherapy. High dose chemotherapy followed by stem cell was given on 25 patients (42%). Thirteen patients had PD (40%), 5 had early relapse (22%) and 7 had late relapse (38%). A number of salvage regimens were used which included EPIC, DHAC and Gemcitibine/Vinorelbine. Reevaluation was done before taking patients to high dose and showed CR in 17 (68%), PR in 6 (24%) and PD in 2 (8%) patients. Twenty one patients (84%) are in remission after transplant with 2 (8%) dead due to septicemia and 2(2%) patients progressed after treatment. Overall survival is 95% at 4 years with event free survival of 80% at 4 years. Conclusions: Our retrospective analysis shows good outcomes in patients who had progressive refractory and relapse disease. Survival is superior in chemo sensitive disease. Solid Non Brain Tumours Neuroblastoma P-122 Prognostic Significance of MGMT Expression in Peripheral Tumors D. Abdallah 1, S. Fadel2, N. Mashalli3 1Alexandria faculty of medicine Egypt, pathology department, Alexandria, Egypt; 2Alexandria faculty of medicine, oncology, Alexandria, Egypt; 3Alexandria faculty of medicine, Pathology, Alexandria, Egypt Background/Objectives: Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid malignancy in childhood. Disease with favourable biologic features is curable with surgery alone, high risk disease is essentially incurable and new treatment strategies are needed for these patients. Temozolamide has shown clinical activity against neuroblastoma. MGMT overexpression was a resistant factor to this drug. Design/Methods: MGMT expression was assessed immunohistochemically on formalin fixed paraffin embedded blocks from 32 neuroblastoma cases. It was then correlated with clinicopathologic parameters as: age, site, histopathology and stage as well as prognostic factors as: fate, treatment protocol, overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) Results: 32 neuroblastic tumors were studied, ages ranged from 2ms to 10 years, 17 were females and 15 were males, 27 cases were abdominal and 5 cases were thoracic. No significant correlation was found between MGMT expression and patient`s age, tumor site, histologic type, grade of differentiation and stage. No significant correlation was noted between MGMT expression and followup data: including fate, DFS and OS as well as treatment protocol Conclusions: MGMT expression is not a prognostic factor in neuroblastoma. This result must be validated on a larger number of cases. P-123 The Relation of Microenvironment Associated Gene Expression with Risk Classification in Neuroblastoma S. Aktas 1, P. Ercetin1, Izmir, Turkey Background/Objectives: Tumor microenvironment is a significant and current topic for invasion, spreading, metastasis and survival of cancer cells. Neuroblastoma is usually poor in terms of stroma and inflammatory elements. It shows a wide spectrum of clinical behaviors from very aggressive forms to spontaneous regression so tumor microenvironment should be considered and evaluated. The aim of the study was to compare microenvironment associated gene expressions of low, intermediate and high risk neuroblastoma with normal control cells with realtime PCR from RNA and cDNA samples of fresh tumor tissues. Fold change analysis were evaluated in compare with control group. Results: 28 cases were included with 39 months mean age (1168 months) and 19 were female, 9 were male. There were 9 high, 5 intermediate and 11 low risk cases. Three cases were mature ganglioneuroma. When gene expression profile of high risk cases were compared with control TNFSF10, BCL2L1, FGF1, FGF23 and FGF14 were decreased. BCL2L1, FGF1 and CD47 expressions were increased in intermediate risk cases. BCL2L1 expression which was increased in all cases, was found to be more in ganglioneuroma cases. High expression of EGFR stood out in low risk cases. PPP3Ca expression was decreased in all cases. CD47 gene which has a role in immune escape, did not show difference in ganglioneuroma while significantly increased in low risk cases. TGFBR1, PLR, FGF14 did not show expression difference in neuroblastoma. Conclusions: When ganglioneuroma, low, intermadiate and high risk neuroblastoma were considered as a spectrum TNSF10 and FGF showed a gradient increase which suggested as candidate risk defining malignancy marker. The increased expression of CD47 was also suggested a remarkable immune escape role for neuroblastoma. P-124 The Effects of Rosiglitazone on Minimal Residual Disease Model of Neuroblastoma Z. Altun 1, M. Ayla1, The major problem in advanced neuroblastoma is presence of minimal residual disease (MRD).We investigated the of peroxisome proliferatoractivating receptor (PPR) agonist, antidiabetic rosiglitazone (RGZ), which regulating cell proliferation and differentiation, on neuronal stem cell differentiation by using MRD model. Design/Methods: PPRgamma expressed and not expressed, SHSY5Y and KELLY neuroblastoma cells were used for MRD model with using increasing LD90 doses of recurrent cisplatin (CDDP) for 1.5 year. CDDP(10400 uM), RGZ(0,1100uM) and CPRGZ combinations were applied and viability of cells was determined with using WST1, apoptosis with AnnexinV/PI and differentiation with and RGZ100, 33.2% and % 83.4 with CDDPRGZ. S100 expression was similar in both MRD model and normal cells. In CDDP treated KELLY cells, differentiation was slightly increased. In CDDPRGZ combination, differentiation was not different from CDDP. RGZ treatment to MRD model of SHSY5Y cells caused less differentiation. Differentiation of survivaed cells was similar both CDDP treated and control cells. The CPRGZ application revealed that the remaining cells were less differentiated than CP alone. In particular, expression of Oct3 and Sox2 in SHSY5Y cells caused reduction in CPRGZ administration in MRD model. Conclusions: CDDP and RGZ and combinations in neuroblastoma MRDdeveloping KELLY cells cell death at similar levels, whereas in PPR expressed SHSY5Y cells, RGZ killed more cells than CDDP and in combination. CPRGZ was effective in decreasing Nestin and Sox2 expressions of neuronal stem cell differentiation markers in SHSY5Y MRD model. Examination of the effects of PPRgammaagonist antidiabetic agents, such as rosiglitazone, in the in vivo models of metastatic neuroblastoma may provide a new perspective on neuroblastoma therapy.

Khattab3, H. Halalsheh1, E. Bouffet4 2KHCCJordan, Pediatric Oncology Department, Amman, Jordan; 3King Hussein Cancer Center, Stem Cell transplantation Pediatric Department KHCC JordanE, Amman, Jordan; 4The Hospital for Sick Children Canada, Neurooncology Division, Toronto, Canada Background/Objectives: HeadStart protocols (HS), a highdose chemotherapy strategy for infants with malignant CNS tumors, reported variable success and toxicity profiles. Their benefitrisk ratio is rarely reported from lowmiddle income countries (LMIC). We aimed to evaluate our HS experience at KHCC/ Jordan. Design/Methods: We retrospectively reviewed charts of children diagnosed with CNS tumors and treated with HS (20062015). Data collected included patients' demographics, chemotherapy complications and cost. Results: Eighteen patients, median age 27 months at diagnosis (1062months), were identified (twelve HSI, six HSII). Twelve (66%) had nonmetastatic disease and four (22%) had GTR. Pathology was ATRT (9), PNET (6) and Medulloblastoma (4). Three patients didn't complete induction cycles (2 ATRT progressed, I PNET failed collection). Fifteen patients (83%) completed induction chemotherapy; eleven (61%) went into CR/PR, two stabilized, two progressed. Seven patients didn't receive SCT (tumor progression(2), financial causes(2), failed stem cell family decline(1) and (1)unknown. Six patients (40%) received radiotherapy; two (residual ATRT) following SCT, two (ATRT) with financial limitations, two (1 ATRT, 1 Medulloblastoma) upon tumor progression. Seventyone chemotherapy cycles were administered (median interval 23 days). Complications during induction and consolidation phases were febrile Three patients (20%) developed hearing deficit and one tubulopathy. At last follow up, 5 patients are alive: three patients with Medulloblastoma (9, 18, 71months); one received CSI 18/54Gy and chemotherapy at relapse. Two patients (29%) with ATRT are alive (8, 27months); both received focal radiation on residual tumor. No chemotherapyrelated deaths occurred. The median hospitalization was 78 days (7194days).The median cost of treatment was 91,000$. Conclusions: Toxicity of HS was manageable for LMIC, but the financial cost was high for a limited survival. Better selection criteria (e.g. high risk medulloblastoma, HSI, and financial support) may outbalance survival over cost. P-126 Minimally Invasive Surgery in Children Intraabdominal Neuroblastoma E. Andreev 1, T. Shamanskaya2 1Dmitry Center of Pediatric Hematology pediatric surgery and oncology, Moscow, National Center of Oncology and Immunology, pediatric oncology, Moscow, Russia Background/Objectives: One of the promising areas in pediatric oncology is MIS in children with thoracoabdominal neuroblastoma.We investigated and comparing the result of laparoscopy and laparotomy treatment. Design/Methods: Radical surgical treatment was performed in 224 patients(01.2012 10.2016).Laparoscopy was performed in 39(17.4%).Patients were treated according to NB2004 protocol.Imagedefined risk factors(IDRF) and size of the tumor were used to select patients.To compare the effects of laparotomy with those of laparoscopy in patients with neuroblastomas without IDRFs, the following items were retrospectively compared: largest tumor dimension, volume of blood loss, time required to initiate postoperative feeding, locoregional recurrence rate, survival, etc. Results: 31 patients without IDRFs(20 at lowmedium risk and 11 at high risk) underwent laparotomy, and 39 patients without IDRFs(31 lowmedium risk and 8 at high risk) underwent laparoscopy.Median age was 14 months(1 - 69) after laparotomy and 11 months(3 - 62) after laparoscopy (p=0.68).Median duration of surgery was 120(70200) and 135(50 300) min(p=0.15).Median postoperative time required for resuming meal consumption was significantly longer in the laparotomy group(2 days; 1-4) than that in the laparoscopy group(0 loss was significantly higher in ml;0-200) than in the laparoscopy group(0 ml;0100;p = draenage removal was ml;08) the laparoscopy group(2 was than in the laparoscopy group(2 days;15;p=0,000002).Median therapy was higher days;311) than the laparoscopy group(5 days;110;p=0,000002).Median 36 months.We have not differences in intraoperative and postoperative complications, local reccurence and mortality in postoperative period. Conclusions: MIS in children with intraabdominal neuroblastoma is an effective technique which enables to carry out radical surgery in the absence of contraindications and IDRF and provides minimally invasiveness and good Oncology/Pathology, Stockholm, Sweden Background/Objectives: Neuroblastoma (NB), which arises from the developing sympathetic nervous system, is one of the most aggressive solid tumors of early childhood. Amplification of the MYCN oncogene is found in around 30% of NB patients and is associated with rapid tumor progression and poor prognosis. Our recent findings show that targeting of MYCN with small molecules including JQ1 and 10058F4 results in metabolic changes including mitochondrial dysfunction leading to accumulation of lipid droplets in NB cells (Zirath et al, PNAS 100, 1025810263, 2013). Design/Methods: To investigate downstream effects of MYCN targeting we have performed quantitative proteomics of MYCNamplified NB cells where MYCN has been downregulated using short hairpin RNA against MYCN. We identified over 7,000 proteins of which around 2250 have been used for identification of novel pathways involved in neuroblastoma pathogenesis. We have also performed metabolic flux analysis. Results: We found that primary metabolic processes including protein, lipid and nucleic acid metabolic processes were the most significantly affected activities upon MYCN downregulation. For analysis of the impact of MYCN expression on glycolysis and mitochondrial capacity we performed metabolic flux measurements using a Seahorse XF analyser. Our data show that MYCNamplified NB cells have a high metabolic potential and that they primarily use oxidative phosphorylation for their energy consumption. We also found that MYCN not only positively regulates the respiratory capacity but also significantly enhances glycolysis. Importantly, we demonstrate that MYCN positively regulates the ability of NB cells to oxidize exogenous fatty acids. Conclusions: Taken together, our findings show that MYCN expression enhances the bioenergetic capabilities and that NB cells can shift their metabolic processes depending on the available nutrition. Our data highlights the importance of metabolic pathways for tumor aggressiveness, which may be the basis for future cancer therapies for patients with NB. P-128 The Chemotherapy Response of Very Early Stage in Neuroblastoma Patients with NMYC Amplification C. huang 1, X. ma1, yue1, zhang1, Hospital, Oncology Center Capital Medical University, Bei Jing, China Background/Objectives: To summarize the clinical features of neuroblastoma with Nmyc amplification. Analyse the biofeatures and evaluate the effect of chemotherapy in early stage Design/Methods: The research analyzed the medical records of 38 patients with Nmyc amplification of NB from Feb 2012 to Dec 2016 in Beijing children's hospital. The regimen were according to the protocol of our hospital, which based on the N7 protocol. The data were reviewed for the medical history. Analysised the viration of biomarker and the primary site, to object the shortterm effect of chemotherapy. Results: 38 cases admitted in the research, The primary site of tumor is retroperitoneal, adrenal area. 27 cases are positive in bone marrow cytomorpholigic examination. The proportion of tumor range 1050% is 3 cases, above 50% is 14 cases. Of all the cases, 37 reported that they had the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level higher than the normal. Only 1 case under 500U/L. 29 cases above 1000U/L. The diameter of tumor lager than 10cm are 32 cases. 33 cases measure the volume. 12 cases are <100cm3, 11 cases range 100cm3 500cm3,10 cases larger than 500cm3. All the 38 cases have finished 2 courses chemotherapy. 35 cases reduce to under 1000U/L. Among the 38 cases, 36 cases' bone marrow examination reverse to negative. According to the imageological examination, the overall response rate after 2 courses chemotherapy is 84.8%. 1 case achieve VGPR, 21 cases achieve PR, 7 cases achieve MR, 2 cases are NR, while 2 cases show PD. Conclusions: NB with Nmyc gene amplification are sensitive to chemotherapy. Chemotherapy can minish the burden of tumor in early stage. But because of the huge burden and the huge size of tumor, it is not the ripe opportunity to receive the surgery or the autologous stem cell transplantation. The patient should go on receiving chemotherapy for remission of disease. P-129 Characteristics of Mediastinal Neuroblastoma Detected by Chance in Children Older Than 18 Months in Japan Y. Cho 1,2, A. Iguchi1, J. Ohshima1, M. Sugiyama1, Y. 1Hokkaido University Hospital, Pediatrics, Sapporo, Japan; 2Hokkaido Cancer Center, Pediatrics, Sapporo, Japan Background/Objectives: Neuroblastoma is an aggressive malignant and heterogeneous tumor in children. Cases under 18 months old, or cases with primary tumor arising from mediastinum tend to have a better prognosis. We sometimes detect by chance cases with mediastinal neuroblastoma when doing an imaging examination for mild respiratory illness in older children. Clarifying their characteristics is important for appropriate treatment. Design/Methods: We analyzed patients with neuroblastoma diagnosed at Hokkaido University Hospital and Hokkaido Cancer Center from 1989 to 2016 retrospectively. Cases under 18 months old, and cases detected by mass screening or with apparent tumorrelated symptoms were excluded. Analytical factors included primary site, detection, stage, pathology, molecular biology, treatment and outcome. Results: Out of 221 patients with neuroblastoma, 11 cases were with mediastinal neuroblastoma detected by chance over 18 months old. Nine cases were detected by Xrays for examining pneumonia/ bronchitis, 1 by abdomen CT scan, 1 by health checkup. Serum NSE levels were from 12.4 to 26.4 (cut off; 12 ng/mL), VMA in urine from 4.3 to 37.1 (cut off; 13mcrg/mgCr), and HVA from 0.7 to 56 (cut off; Eight cases were totally resected with videoassisted thoracoscopic surgery/ open thoracic surgery. Two were limited to partial resection even in open thoracic surgery. One had only biopsy for diagnosis. Eight cases were in INSS stage 1, one case in stage 2, and 2 cases in stage 3. Six cases were ganglioneuroblastoma and 5 were ganglioneuroma. MYCN gene was not amplified in any case. Chemotherapy was performed for 2 cases before 2000. Cases after 2000 had no chemotherapy even with partial resection. All were alive for more than 3 years after diagnosis. Conclusions: Almost every case with mediastinal neuroblastoma detected by chance over 18 months old showed characteristics of low risk group. Good prognosis can be expected without drastic treatment. P-130 Minimal Residual Disease in Bone Marrow of Patients with High Risk Neuroblastoma in 31 Patients from a Single Institution in Argentina M. CIMOLAI 1, A. MEDINA1, R. MITCHELL2, P. Aires, Argentina Background/Objectives: The neuroblastoma (NB) is dependent on several well stablished prognostic factors. Bone marrow (BM) evaluation by conventional cytology, at diagnosis and during treatment, has limited sensitivity and it is not suitable for minimal residual disease (MRD) detection. PHOX2B measurment by quantitativeRTPCR has been described as a sensitive and specific marker for MRD analysis. Our aim was to perform molecular MRD evaluation at different time points in order to evaluate the prognostic value of PHOX2B in our population of highrisk patients. Design/Methods: Quantitative RTPCR for PHOX2B was performed in 271 BM samples from 31 patients with highriskNB treated at the Garrahan Pediatric Hospital with first or second line treatment protocols. A median of 8 samples per patient were evaluated [range: 219]. Median followup time was 13 [range: 344] months. The prognostic impact of MRD at diagnosis (n=22), after cycle 3 (n=22), after cycle 5 (n=20), or at any followup time (n=28) was evaluated using and Logranktests. Results: PHOX2B was detected in 21/22 evaluable samples at diagnosis, and in 9/22 after cycle 3, and no correlation was found between outcome and MRD status at both time points. However, molecular BM remission (PHOX2B not detectable) was associated with a better outcome for MRD negativity after cycle 5 (10/20; Fisherp=0.0364; 2ypEFS: the number of patients included in the study, negative MRD in BM samples after cycle 5, or at every followup time during treatment, seems to identify a group of patients with highriskNB with a significant better outcome. No association was found between PHOX2B at diagnosis or after cycle 3 of treatment. These preliminary results suggest that PHOX2Bcould be a useful MRD marker in our population of patients with highrisk NB. P-131 MLN8237 Induces Cellular Senescence by A. Liu 1, Liu4, Sun5, Q. Hu5 1Tongji Hospital Tongji Medical College Huazhong University of Science & Technology, Pediatrics, Wuhan, China; 2Tongji Hospital Tongji Medical College Hua Zhong University of Science and T, Pediatrics, Wuhan, China; 3Tongji HospitalTongji Medical College Huazhong University of Science & Technology, Experimental Medicine Center, Wuhan, China; 4UT Southwestern Medical Center, Radiation Oncology, Dallas, USA; 5Tongji HospitalTongji Medical College Huazhong University of Science & Technology, Pediatrics, Wuhan, China Background/Objectives: Neuroblastoma is one of the most common malignancy pediatric solid tumors and the prognosis of highrisk neuroblastoma is still poor. MYCN amplification is a risk factor and the stability of NMYC is closely linked to Aurora A. In this study, we investigated the effect and molecular mechanism of senescence induced by MLN8237 (Alisertib), a small molecule that selective inhibit Aurora A, in high risk neuroblastoma. Design/Methods: Senescence was detected by SAgal staining. The related proteins expressions were analyzed by Western blot. In vivo experiments were carried out in tumor xenograft model mice. Results: MLN8237 could induce neuroblastoma cells senescence by NMYC downregulation via inhibiting the phosphorylation of Aurora A. It could also inhibit tumor growth and prolong the survival time of xenograft tumor mice. However, some senescent cells tended to recover from cell cycle arrest during the MLN8237 treatment in vitro. We found MLN8237 activated the interleukin6 and signal transducer and activator of transcription factor3 (IL6/STAT3) pathway, which could promote the tumor progression and recurrence. When IL6/STAT3 of senescence neuroblastoma cells were inhibited by LLL12, a small molecule STAT3 inhibitor, senescence reversion could be Conclusions: by downregulation of NMYC and then activates the IL6/STAT3 pathway of senescent cells. These results provide a new relapse mechanism of neuroblastoma and exploring novel therapeutic targets on cellular senescence and IL6/STAT3 signaling. P-132 The Value of Detection of Circulating Tumor Cell in Neuroblastoma Patients on the Prognosis and Treatment Evaluation K. Dong 1, X. liu1, R. Dong1 1Children's Hospital of Fudan University, surgery, Shanghai, China Background/Objectives: Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) has been shown to be associated with prognosis and therapeutic efficacy in many tumors. We detection the peripheral blood circulating tumor cells in neuroblastoma and discuse its value on the prognosis and treatment evaluation. Design/Methods: There were 28 newly diagnosed cases of neuroblastoma. The circulating tumor cells were collected by the negative enrichment method combined with iFISH. The relationship between the number of circulating tumor cells and the clinical factors were analyzed. In addition, the peripheral blood CTC of other types solid tumors was examined to assess the difference with neuroblastoma. Results: In children with distant metastases, the number of CTCs is higher than those in other types of tumors. The number of CTCs in the high, middle and low risk groups of children were statistically different (Mean rank diff = 8.583). The number of CTC in children with Nmyc positive was lower than that in Nmycnegative children (p = 0.6133). 24hour urine VMA has no relationship with CTC numbers, but serum NSE has positive correlation with CTC numbers, Spearman test, r = 0.463 95% CI (0.09713, 0.7186), p = 0.0131. There was significant difference between the distant metastasis group and nonmetastasis group (p <0.0001). For those whose CTC number >10, the number is significantly went down in 80% of the patients after the chemotherapy. After 16 months of followup, The ROC curve shows AUCROC is 0.81, 95% CI (0.57, 1.04) and the cutoff was 6. The survival time for those CTCs number>5 at the time of dignose was shorter. Conclusions: The number of peripheral blood CTC in children with neuroblastoma is higher than in other solid tumors. CTC number is associated with COG classification, distant metastasis, and serum NSE levels. The survival time of those children with peripheral blood CTC number> 5 is shorter than those MicroRNA 128A Downregulation and Outcome A. Druy 1, G. Tsaur2, E. Y. Olshanskaya1, L. Saveliev5, L. 1National Scientific and Practical Center of Pediatric Hematology Oncology and I, Laboratory of Cytogenetics and Molecular Genetics, Moscow, Russia; 2Research Institute of Medical Cell Technologies, Laboratory of Cellular Therapeutics of Oncohematological Disorders, Yekaterinburg, Russia; 3PETtechnology 5Ural State Medical University, Chair of Laboratory Medicine, Yekaterinburg, Russia Background/Objectives: Clinical heterogeneity is a hallmark of neuroblastoma (NB). TERT hyperexpression was identified as adverse prognostic marker, while significance of microRNA expression profile in NB is undiscovered. Aim. Investigation of prognostic significance of miR128A and TERT expression in primary NB. Design / Methods: RNA samples from 103 freshfrozen NB tissues were subjected to qRTPCR for miR128A and TERT expression evaluation. Copy number variations were determined by MLPA and FISH. Correspondence of miR128A and TERT expression levels to eventfree survival (EFS) was proved by ROCanalysis and established threshold levels (TL) were utilized for group separation in subsequent survival analysis. Median of followup time achieved 5.8 years. Results: Abundant TERT expression and lack of miR128A expression resulted in superior frequency of adverse events (p=0.027, TL=4,7E3 and p=0.004, TL=4.6E2 respectively). EFS in group of patients with TERT expression above 4,7E3 (group TERT) was 0.66SE0.07, in patients with miR128A expression below 4.6E2 (group miR128A) was 0.64SE0.15, patients harboring both TERT overexpression and lack of miR128A expression (group miR128/TERT) had dismal outcome: EFS 0.29SE0.11, comparing to patients without these abnormalities (group neither): EFS 0.92SE0.06, p<0.001. Analogously cumulative incidence of progression was 0.32SE0.07, miR128A amplified were accumulated in the groups TERT and miR128/TERT (p=0.061), while gain of chromosome 17, 9p and 14q deletions prevailed in the group neither (p=0.014, 0.043 and 0.017 accordingly). MNA and 14q deletion had significance in the correspondent groups (p<0.001, p=0.022). The classifier was proposed for distinguishing patients with unequal outcome: MNA EFS=0.25SE0.11, MYCN single copy miR128A (0.60SE0.15) and TERT (0.74SE0.08). Group neither was basing on presence (0.71SE0.17) or absence (EFS=1.00) of 14q deletion, p<0.001. Conclusions: Levels of miR128A and TERT expression together with cytogenetic data allow discriminating patients into groups with significantly different outcome. P-134 Magnetic Resonance Guided High Intensity Focused Ultrasound Treatment Effects in a Mouse Model of Neuroblastoma A. Fahy 1, S. Papp2, K. Piorkowska3, General and Thoracic Surgery, Toronto, Canada; 2University of Toronto, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, Toronto, Canada; 3Hospital for Sick Children, Center for Image Guided Innovation and Therapeutic Interventions, Toronto, Canada; 4Thunder Bay Regional Research Institute, ImageGuided Interventions, Thunder Bay, Canada; 5Hospital for Sick Children, Department of Hematology/Oncology, Toronto, Canada; 6Hospital for Sick Children, Department of Pathology, Toronto, Canada Background/Objectives: Magnetic Resonance guided High intensity focused ultrasound (MRgHIFU) is a noninvasive technology that uses an extracorporeal focused ultrasound transducer to converge high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) energy onto a specific tissue target via MR guidance. This focused ultrasound energy can induce localized thermal necrosis of benign or malignant tissue while simultaneous MR thermometry can monitor the temperatures of surrounding structures to avoid unintended thermal injuries. We aimed to evaluate the effects of MRgHIFU in a mouse model of neuroblastoma (NBL). (n=18) were inoculated with a CHLA15 NBL cell line in the left hind limb and tumor growth monitored until size reached 5mm in largest dimension. Tumors (n=10) were treated with MRgHIFU at 42.5 acoustic Watts for 20 seconds. Control tumors (n=8) were imaged but not treated. Immediately posttreatment, mice were euthanized and the tumors immersion fixed in 10% neutral buffered paraffin embedded, and with elastin trichrome for gross and histological evaluation. Results: Tumors reached 5.1 +/ 1.7 mm in size (treated = 5.8 +/ 1.9 mm, untreated 4.2 +/ 0.6 mm). HIFU treatment increased the temperature in the tumors to a range between 55\u00b0C and 80\u00b0C. Histological changes in the treated tumors included confluent necrosis, diffuse single cell necrosis, and large areas of intratumoral hemorrhage. Untreated tumors had sporadic single cell necrosis and small areas of intratumoral hemorrhage but no areas of confluent necrosis. Conclusions: MRgHIFU can be used to cause localized thermal necrosis of tumors in a mouse model of NBL. Further work is underway to investigate the effect of MRgHIFU on tumor growth and mouse survival. MRgHIFU may offer a potential additional local therapy to patients with recurrent or refractory high risk NBL. P-135 Does Salvage Chemotherapy Regimen Intensity Embark on Clearance of Bone Marrow Neuroblastoma? A. elhemaly 1, M. fawzy1, A. Hamoda1, E. moussa2, H. reda3, S. elmenawi4 1national cancer institute and children cancer hospital of egypt, pediatric oncology, Cairo, Egypt; 2children cancer hospital of egypt and elmonofia university, pediatric oncology, Cairo, Egypt; 3national cancer institute and children cancer hospital of egypt, clinical pathology, Cairo, Egypt; 4children cancer hospital of egypt, clinical research, Cairo, Egypt Background/Objectives: neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumor in children. It accounts for 15% of the deaths from cancer in the pediatric age group. Approximately half of the newly diagnosed children are at \"high risk\" of treatment failure. This study aim was to evaluate the impact of salvage chemotherapy ICE (Ifosfamide, Carboplatin, and Etoposide) versus TC (Topotecan/Cyclophosphamide) when administered to neuroblastoma high risk patients having residual bone marrow disease after primary tumor control on first line treatment regimen. Design/Methods: the present retrospective study included 2 matched groups of eligible stage 4 neuroblastoma patients with persistent bone marrow disease. Each group consisted of 36 patients. Group (1) patients received ICE whereas less intensive TC was administered to Group (2). Data analysis included epidemiological variables, pathology subtype, NMYC gene status, primary tumor response and their correlation with bone marrow disease clearance on each regimen. Results: higher tendency of complete bone marrow clearance was reported in patients received ICE compared to TC; 33.3% versus 22.2%, respectively. However, the difference was not statistically significant (p= 0.293). Conclusions: TC regimen appears to be noninferior to ICE as salvage treatment in attempt to clear bone marrow neuroblastoma residual, with the privilege of being less toxic and can be given on outpatient basis. Yet, further randomized trials of larger study sample size and with survival impact analysis are warranted. P-136 Quality Indicators in Neuroblastoma (NBL) Treatment P. Hoogerbrugge1, S. Dijkstra 2, Tytgat1, 1Princess M\u00e1xima Center Oncology, The Netherlands Background/Objectives: To improve neuroblastoma (NBL) treatment within a center, and compare NBL treatment between centers, quality indicators may be helpful as surrogate markers of effective treatment. In our study, we report data of 4 quality indicators (diagnostic workup, thyroid protection at MIBGscanning, treatmentdelay and use of tumor board meetings) that may correlate with treatment effectivity and toxicity. Design/Methods: A crosssectional, retrospective analysis was performed of Dutch patients treated for NBL in the national centralized facilities of the Princess M\u00e1xima Center. Medical records were reviewed to extract information on demographics, treatment and quality of care indicators. The variables recorded included 1: timeinterval from presentation to complete diagnosis,2: use of thyroid prophylaxis before MIBG imaging, 3: chemotherapy intervals and 4: use of tumorboard meetings. Analysis of surgical procedures is topic of another study, and not included in this analysis. Results: Data of 47 patients treated between 2014 and 2017 were available for analysis. Patients were classified INSS stage I in 2% of cases, stage II in 11%, stage III in 19%, stage IV in 65% and stage IVS in 2%. Sixtysix percent of patients with NBL were stratified for DCOGNBL highrisk treatment. The median time between presentation and complete diagnostic workup (urinary catecholamines, pathology, MIBGscan) was 8 days (range 242 days). Prescription of thyroidprophylactic treatment prior to MIBGscans was recorded in 190 of 200 MIBGscans (95%). In only 2 patients, the interval between diagnosis and the end of the 6th chemotherapycourse was more than 120% of the originally planned, protocolbased interval. Finally, we found that 75% (123 of 164) of the protocolbased evaluations were discussed in tumorboard meetings. Conclusions: Identification and analysis of qualityindicators in neuroblastoma treatment is feasible, and may provide tools to improve treatment over time and compare treatment quality between various centers. P-137 Individualized Risk Assessment in Neuroblastoma: Does The Tumoral Metabolic Activity in I123MIBGSPECT Predict the J. I. Schatka1 1Charit\u00e9 University Medicine, Department of Nuclear Medicine, Berlin, Germany; 2Charit\u00e9 University Medicine, Pediatric Oncology, Cancer Dresden, Germany; 4University Medicine Greifswald, Institute for Diagnostic Radiology and Neuroradiology, Greifswald, Germany; 5University Medicine Greifswald, Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Greifswald, Germany Background/Objectives: Riskadapted treatment in children with neuroblastoma (NB) occurs according to clinical and genetic factors. This study evaluated the significance of metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and its asphericity (ASP) in pretherapeutic I123MIBGSPECT (IMS) for individualized imagebased prediction of outcome. Design/Methods: Retrospective analysis in 23 children (f:11; m:12; median age, 1.8 [0.36.8] years) with primary diagnosis of NB consecutively examined by pretherapeutic IMS. Primary tumor's MTV and ASP were defined using semiautomatic thresholds. Cox regression, ROC analysis (cutoff determination) and KaplanMeier (KM) analyses with logrank test for eventfree survival (EFS) were performed for ASP, MTV, laboratory parameters (such as urinary homovanillic acidtocreatinine ratio [HVA/C]), clinical (age, stage) and genetic factors. Predictive accuracy of the optimal multifactorial model was determined by Harrell's C and LR 2. Results: Median followup was months (p=0.038; HR, 1.012) and MYCN (p=0.047; HR, 4.67) were the only significant predictors of EFS in univariate Cox; only ASP also in multivariate analysis (p=0.026; HR, 1.042). Mean EFS for high (>32.0%) vs. low ASP was 21 vs. 88 months (p=0.013), and for high (>46.7 ml) vs. low MTV 22 vs. 87 months (p=0.023). A combined risk model of either high ASP and high HVA/C or high MTV and high HVA/C best predicted EFS. Conclusions: In this explorative study, pretherapeutic imagederived and laboratory markers tumoral metabolic activity in neuroblastoma (ASP, MTV, urinary HVAtocreatinine ratio) allowed to identify children with high and low risk for progression/relapse treated according to current therapy protocols.

Design/Methods: Prospective singlearm studies (JNI10) were conducted. Patients with INSS stage 3 without MYCN amplification, including children of >12 months of age with favorable histology and 1218 months of age with unfavorable histology, were treated with lowdose induction regimen B (vincristine/cyclophosphamide/pirarubicin) or C (vincristine/cyclophosphamide/carboplatin). If no IDRFs were present, the patient underwent surgery. The resectability of the tumors was judged based on the IDRF every 3 courses. When the response rate was insufficient, the treatment was changed to up to 9 courses of regimen D (vincristine/cyclophosphamide/pirarubicin/cisplatin).Patients with stage 4 without MYCN amplification, including children <12 months and 1218 months of age with favorable histology and a DNA index of >1, were treated with 5 to 6 courses of regimen D. When possible, surgical resection was performed based on the IDRF after 3 courses. Target sample size was 73. Results: At the planned interim analysis, 38 eligible patients were enrolled in this trial (stage 3, n=9; stage 4, n=29). The median age was 8 months (range, 0-45 months). The 3year progressionfree survival rates of the whole study population, the stage 3 patients and the stage 4 patients were of the whole study population showed ileus, while 20% showed pleural effusion and ascites as early complications after surgery; however there were no longterm complications of surgery. The trial was decided to continue. Conclusions: Our treatment strategy did not increase the incidence of longterm complications. This trial was decided to continue. P-139 GSTP1 Gene Expression and A313G Polymorphism Can Affect Neuroblastoma M. Inomistova O. Skachkova1, G. Klymniuk2, S. Pavlyk2 Cancer Institute, Laboratory of Experimental Oncology, Kiev, Ukraine; 2National Cancer Institute, Department of Pediatric Oncology, Kiev, Ukraine Background/Objectives: Neuroblastoma malignant paediatric tumour of sympathetic nervous system and is often accompanied with MYCN amplification (MNA). Study of glutathioneStransferase P1 (GSTP1) which affects the chemotherapy efficiency can help to understand the mechanism of neuroblastoma progression. Design/Methods: Case group comprised of 144 children with neuroblastoma and control group of 158 healthy donors. A313G GSTP1 polymorphism was detected with allelespecific PCR in DNA from peripheral blood of patients and healthy donors. GSTP1 expression level (EL) was analysed with qRTPCR in tumour samples using TaqMan primers (P=0.46). G313G genotype was observed in patients with advanced stages (8.8% III and 12.2% IV stages) and earlier occurrence age of neuroblastoma (median 18 months, A313A - 28 months, A313G - 34 months). Most patients with MNA had A313A (63.1%) while highest GSTP1 EL was observed in tumours with unfavourable clinical features (early occurrence age; advanced stages; recurrent and metastatic foci). Lower EL was observed in MNA tumour samples and in patients with A313A genotype. Analysing 3year overall survival (OS) we established that patients with G313G genotype had significantly lower according to GSTP1 EL 0.64) and analysed OS according to GSTP1 polymorphism and EL. OS was significantly higher in patients with A313G and low GSTP1 EL comparing to other groups (P<0.05). Conclusions: GSTP1 G313G genotype was associated with unfavourable neuroblastoma, while patients with A313G and low GSTP1 EL had higher OS. Analysis of GSTP1 polymorphism and expression along with other biomarkers is an important step to improve neuroblastoma risk of Strasbourg, EA3430, Strasbourg, France Background/Objectives: Neuroblastoma is the second most frequent pediatric solid tumor. In high risk neuroblastoma, Nmyc amplified and/or metastatic patients' overall survival is only 40% and there is no hope of cure in case of relapse. Intratumor hypoxia appears to be correlated with an aggressive phenotype and resistance to chemotherapy as recently described in neuroblastoma, but no specific study described precisely the Pi3K/AKT/mTor/HIF1a pathway involvement. The pathway activation seems to be linked to poor prognostic tumors. Recently, ATRX mutations has also been described in association with highrisk neuroblastoma and possibly linked to their hypoxia. Design/Methods: A retrospective study was designed to characterize to target by immunohistochemistry (IHC) Pi3K, AKT, mTor and ATRX in neuroblastomas in 26 patients of Strasbourg's center, who have signed with their parents an informed consent. Results: Six biomarkers were analyzed by IHC: HIF1a, HIF2a, pAKT, negative for HIF1a. HIF2a was overexpressed in 16 patients out of the 26, which among those 10 patients were high risk patients. Among the 4 pAKT positive patients, 3 out of 4 were also HIF2a positive and 2 out of 4 had a pERK, pS6RP and HIF2a coexpression. Positivity for pERK (9 patients) and pS6RP (9 patients) were mainly localized in vessels and only 5 patients had concomitant pERK and pS6RP positive stainings. Loss of ATRX was observed in 8 patients without any correlation with the other markers. Conclusions: This preliminary study shows the implication of hypoxia signaling pathway, and mainly HIF2a in neuroblastomas. P-141 Treatment Of IntermediateRisk Neuroblastoma: Experience of Russian Federal Center D. Kachanov 1, T. Shamanskaya1, E. Andreev2, D. Shevtsov1, Oncology Immunology, Hematology Oncology Immunology, Nuclear Medicine, Moscow, Russia Background/Objectives: The aim of the study was to analyze the clinical characteristics and results of therapy of patients with intermediaterisk neuroblastoma treated in Russian federal center. Design/Methods: 270 patients with neuroblastoma were treated for the period 01.201206.2015 (42 months). The diagnosis has been established on the basis of the international criteria. FISH was done to assess the status of 1p and 11q. Patients were stratified and treated according to the German NB2004 protocol. 19 (7.1%) patients were stratified to the intermediaterisk group. Therapy consists of 6 cycles of multiagent chemotherapy, surgery, radiation therapy to the MIBGavid residual primary tumor after induction chemotherapy, 4 cycles of maintenance therapy and 9 cycles of 13cisretinoic acid. Results: Male:female ratio was 0.58:1. The median age was 10.4 months (range 1.691.5). The most common site of primary tumor was retroperitoneum 12 (63.2%). Stage distribution: stage 4 12 (63.2%) cases, stage 3 6 (31.5%), stage 2 1 (5.3%). 3 (15.8%) had segmental chromosomal aberrations. 17 (89.4%) patients received per protocol therapy, 2 were treated with protocol modification because of treatmentrelated complications. Surgery was done in 18 patients, macroscopic residual tumor was observed in 16 (88.8%). Radiation therapy was done in 3 (15.7%). After induction therapy 12 (63.2 %) patients achieved complete and very good partial response. There was no difference in response rate between stage 4 and stage 2/3 ( = 0.65). Median followup was 37.0 months (range - 20.4-57.3). Progression/relapse was observed in 4 (21.0 %) cases. 4year OS was 100%. 4year EFS of the whole cohort was 78.9 \u00b1 9.3 %. EFS in patients treated without protocol violations was 93.7 \u00b1 6.0 %. Conclusions: Intensification of therapy in patients with intermediaterisk neuroblastoma, compared with patients in the observation group, allows achieving satisfactory results given that therapy was provided without violations. P-142 CNS Relapses of HighRisk Neuroblastoma: Analysis of Risk Factors and Clinical Outcomes T. Shamanskaya 1, D. Kachanov1, S. Ozerov2, G. Tereschenko3, Oncology Immunology, Nuclear Russia; 5Federal Hematology Oncology Immunology, patients with highrisk neuroblastoma are an extremely unfavorable clinical event. The aim of the study was to analyze the frequency of occurrence and the factors predisposing to the development of the CNS involvement in patients with highrisk neuroblastoma at the time of the first relapse. Design/Methods: Patients with highrisk neuroblastoma who received treatment for the period 01.2012 12.2015 were included in the analyses. Patients were stratified to risk groups and treated according to German NB2004 protocol. Highdose preparative regimens included melphalan/etoposide/carboplatin (MEC) (till June 2013) and treosulfan/melphalan (TreoMel) (since July 2013). Results: 111 patients were analyzed. 58/111 (52.3%) had progression/relapse, CNS involvement was observed in Isolated CNS involvement was noted in 7/10 (70%). Median age at the time of the neuroblastoma diagnosis in patients with CNS involvement was 27.3 months (range 1,843,5). Male: female ratio was 1.5:1. The primary tumor located in the abdomen in 9/10 cases, unknown primary in 1/10. All 10 patients had stage 4 disease. MYCN amplification was detected in 8/10 (80%). Median time from diagnosis till progression/relapse was 15.2 months (range 5.920.0). Comparison between two groups of relapsed patients (CNS involvement/ lack of CNS involvement) by sex, age, site of the primary tumor, MYCN gene status, skull metastases, bone marrow involvement at the onset of the disease, the number of metastatic compartments, response to induction therapy before autoHSCT, type of preparative regimen (CEM vs Treo/Mel) showed no statistically significant difference. 2year overall survival after the development of CNSrelapse in the study group was 13.1 \u00b1 12.1%. Conclusions: CNS involvement at the time of relapse is a frequent event in highrisk neuroblastoma. The introduction of CNS MRI into the standard workup at the time of relapse/progression will allow timely detection of metastases to optimize the therapeutic strategy. P-143 Complete Clinical Response in HighRisk Neuroblastoma After ALKInhibitor MonoTherapy Specifically Targeting the Novel Activating I1171T ALK Mutation P. Kogner 1, D. Treis1, J. Siaw2, Fransson3, Medical Biochemistry and Cell Institutet, Pediatric Surgery, Stockholm, Sweden Background/Objectives: Personalized medicine and implementation of successful targeted therapies requires understanding of complex molecular mechanisms. Activating ALKaberrations are important genetic factors in neuroblastoma development and aggressiveness, and have been suggested for novel targeted therapies. Embryonal childhood tumors with underlying Fanconi anemia are not available for conventional chemotherapy and have a very poor outcome. Design/Methods: A 15 monthold patient with 11qdeleted HRneuroblastoma with bonemarrow, bone and on SIOPEN COJECinduction with severe longlasting multiorgan toxicity already after second chemotherapycourse found to be due to underlying Fanconi anemia confirmed with chromosomebreakage analysis and germline FANCAmutations novel somatic neuroblastoma ALK(c.3215T>C; I1171T) mutation. In search for therapeutic opportunities the biological nature of this ALKmutation was characterized preclinically. Results: We show here that this novel ALK tyrosine kinase domain mutation of I1171 to threonine generates a potent gainoffunction mutant, as observed in cell culture model systems. ALKI1171Texpressing PC12 cells showed ligandindependent ALK activation, neurite outgrowth and downstream signaling activation. Further, ALKI1171T mediated foci formation in NIH3T3 transformation analysis. Finally, ceritinib/LDK378 14fold crizotinib. When lifethreatening platinuminduced toxicity with complications had been handled/subsided targeted treatment with ceritinib/LDK378 (450mg/m2540mg/m2) was started as compassionate use. Elevated urinary catecholaminemarkers were normalized after the first 4weektreatment cycle. Hemoglobin normalized and platelets improved to stable levels (>100). Metastatic disease gradually resolved and MRI showed 1/3reduction of the primary tumor that was then radically removed after 6 months' treatment. Complete radiological workup (MRI/CTscan/mIBG), urinary catecholamines and bonemarrow investigations confirmed complete response after 21 months of ALKinhibitor treatment without significant sideeffects (only mild GIsymptoms were noted). Conclusions: Here we show that the ALK(I1171T)mutation is activating and promotes neuroblastoma aggressiveness. Monotherapy with ALKinhibitor ceritinib induced complete response in a child with metastatic highrisk neuroblastoma unable to receive conventional treatment. P-144 Identify Novel Neuroblastoma Vandepoele2, A. DiezFraile1, Van De Wilde1, T. Lammens1, G. Laureys 1 1Ghent University Hospital, Department of Pediatric HematologyOncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Ghent, Belgium; 2Ghent University Hospital, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Ghent, Belgium; 3Ghent university Hospital, Center for Medical Genetics Ghent CMGG, Ghent, Belgium Background/Objectives: Genetic susceptibility to cancer has been the subject of considerable interest in unraveling the etiology and natural history of cancer and plays an essential role in understanding the molecular biology of cancer. Familial clustering of childhood cancers is among the strongest suggestive situation of a genetic susceptibility. Design/Methods: Exome sequencing was used to identify novel cancer predisposition genes in a family with a boy affected by neuroblastoma and his second cousin by a ganglioneuroma. Interestingly, we previously identified a de novo constitutional translocation t(1;17)(p36.2;q11.2) in the boy, which was absent in the affected second cousin (Laureys et al., 1995; Laureys et al, 1990). Results: Predisposing variants were put forward as candidates through selection of nonsynonymous, rare/novel variants, shared by the affected second cousins and mothers (being first cousins) and not found in the spousal controls. Amongst others, we identified a deleterious mutation in CLEC12B (c.790A>G; p.E264K) located at the Cterminal end of the lectin Ctype domain in a highly conserved region and potentially interferes with ligand interaction or homodimerization. Interestingly, Hoffmanns and colleagues, have shown that CLEC12B (12p13.2) binds PTPN11 and PTPN6. Interfering with this interaction protects against natural killer cellmediated cytotoxicity, indicating that mutations within CLEC12B may affect immune surveillance. Both PTNP11 and PTNP6 are wellknown cancer predisposition genes (Hoffmann et al., 2007; Seishima et al., 2007; Jongmans et al., 2011). In silico analysis revealed that somatic mutation frequencies for CLEC12B vary from 2.2% in medulloblastoma to 0.4% in head and neck carcinoma. Conclusions: This and ongoing work highlights the value of using index families with multiple children affected by cancer, as a valuable source to identify novel cancer predisposition genes. *TL and GL are shared senior authors P-145 External Beam Radiotherapy is not Associated with the Incidence, Severity or Duration of Sinusoidal Obstruction Syndrome J. Lucas Jr. 1, S. Braunstein2, V. Tolbert3, A. Sunkara4, G. Kang4, K. L. Children's Research Hospital, Radiation Oncology, Memphis, USA; 2University of California San Francisco, Radiation Oncology, San Francisco, USA; 3University of California San Francisco, Pediatrics, San Francisco, USA; 4St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Biostatistics, Oncology, Memphis, USA; 6St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, Memphis, USA Background/Objectives: Sinusoidal Obstruction Syndrome (SOS) is a morbid complication of High Risk Neuroblastoma (HRNB) therapy. We evaluated associations between external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), I131MIBG, chemotherapy, and clinical factors on SOS incidence, duration and severity in HRNB patients. Design/Methods: 98 newly diagnosed HRNB patients treated from 1997 to 2016 at multiple institutions with induction and consolidation chemotherapy, autologous stem cell transplant, radiotherapy and maintenance therapy[FS1] were retrospectively reviewed. We examined patient, laboratory, and treatment characteristics up to 100 days posttransplant. SOS prophylaxis, treatment, and complications (intubation, multiorgan failure, etc.) were documented. Generalized linear regression was used to assess the associations of covariates with the incidence, duration and severity of SOS. Results: Sixteen patients were diagnosed with SOS (median time from transplant to SOS, 22 days [range, 9130]). The median duration of SOS was 13 days (range, 363). All but 2 cases of SOS preceded EBRT. The median time to EBRT from transplant in patients with and without SOS was 8.6 and 5.3 weeks respectively (p<0.001). Earlier time to EBRT, prescription dose (Gy), and liver dose (Dmean, D25, D50, D75) did not impact the incidence, duration, recurrence or severity of SOS. Induction (ANBL0532 vs. other, p=0.005), and (MEC vs. =3.0, P<.001)] chemotherapy impacted the duration of SOS. SOSassociated death occurred in one patient who received I131MIBG during consolidation. SOS incidence and complications were not different across I131MIBG (N=8) and nonI131MIBG (N=90) treated patients (p=0.6). However, 2/2 I131MIBG treated patients who developed SOS required ICU support, compared to 4/14 (29%) nonMIBG treated patients (p=0.12). Conclusions: In this moderntreatment cohort, EBRT dose, volume and timing after transplant did not impact the incidence, severity, recurrence or duration of SOS. Induction and transplant conditioning impacted the duration and severity of SOS. P-146 Studies of the Mechanism in EpithelialMesenchymal Transition Induced by TGF1 in Neuroblastoma Cells J. Shao1, Hospital, Children's Hospital, Surgery, China Background/Objectives: Neuroblastoma is the second most common extracranial malignant solid tumor that occurs in childhood. Metastasis is one of the major causes of death in neuroblastoma patients. The epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT) is an important mechanism for both the initiation of tumor invasion and subsequent metastasis. This study investigated the mechanism in EMT induced by transforming growth factor (TGF)1 in SKNSH human neuroblastoma cells. Design/Methods: The present study focused on the regulatory effects of TGF1 on the EMT in human neuroblastoma SKNSH cells and the correlation with transcription factor Gli using quantitative RTPCR, western blot analysis, immunocytochemistry, cell transfection, etc. Results: We identified that the mRNA and protein expression levels of Ecadherin were significantly decreased while SMA were significantly increased after SKNSH cells were treated with different concentration of TGF1. A scratch test and transwell migration assay revealed that cell migration was increased significantly with increasingly higher concentrations of TGF1. Which means TGF1 can induce the EMT in SKNSH cells to increase SKNSH cell migration. Interference the expression of Smad2/3 did not affect the expression of the key molecules in the EMT. Further investigation found the expression of transcription factor Gli increased significantly in EMT induced by TGF1 in SKNSH cells. Interfering with the expression of Gli1/Gli2 can inhibit the EMT induced by TGF1 in SKNSH cells. GANT61, which target to inhibitors transcription factor Gli1 and Gli2, can reduce the proliferation of cells, promote cell apoptosis. Conclusions: The authors conclude that TGF1 can induce the EMT in SKNSH cells to increase SKNSH cell migration. EMT induced by TGF1 in SKNSH cells may does not depend on the Smad signaling pathway. Transcription factor Gli participates in the EMT induced by TGF1 through Smad independent signaling pathways. P-147 Synergistic Effect of Curcumin and Nanoceria in the Treatment of Childhood Neuroblastoma J. Mazar 1, A. Rosado1, T. Hospital, Biomedical Research, Orlando, USA; 2University of Central Florida, Materials Science and Engineering Advanced Materials Processing Center, Orlando, USA; 3University of Central Florida, Nanoscience Technology Center, Orlando, USA Background/Objectives: MYCNamplification is associated with poor prognosis in human neuroblastoma, reflective of a low overall survival rate in children with this gene amplification. As a result, we are investigating novel molecular formulations of nanoceria and dextrannanoceria with curcumin, each demonstrated to have anticancer properties, synthesized and applied as a treatment for neuroblastoma. Anticancer activities of these formulations were explored in neuroblastoma cells that were both MYCNamplified and MYCNnonamplified. Design/Methods: To test these formulations, we utilized the MYCNamplified neuroblastoma cell lines IMR32 and SMSKAN, as well as the nonamplified cell lines SKNAS and LAN6. The effects induced in neuroblastoma cells by these nanoformulations with curcumin were examined by MTS, Caspase 3/7, ROS, and TUNEL assays, as well as by qRTPCR and Western blot analysis for changes in gene expression. HUVEC cells served as control cells to evidence the cytoprotective effects of ceria nanoparticles. Results: Ceria nanoparticles, coated with dextran and loaded with curcumin, were found to induce substantial cell death in neuroblastoma cells while producing no or minor toxicity towards healthy cells. Death of neuroblastoma cells was confirmed to be due to apoptosis induced via BCL2/BAX ratio disruption and reactive oxygen species accumulation. Additionally, expression of HIF1 was analyzed and shown to be upregulated in samples treated with ceria due to ceria's oxygen buffering capacity. Conclusions: Treatment of neuroblastoma cells, both MYCNamplified and MYCNnonamplified, with ceria nanoparticles successfully induced cell death. The additional coating of the nanoceria with dextran appeared to further enhance this phenotype. An analysis of the cause of cell death suggested that apoptosis was induced due to the stabilization of HIF1, indicating induction of hypoxic conditions and significant accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Overall, ceria treatments showed a more pronounced effect in MYCNamplified cells, which are traditionally more resistant to drug therapies. P-148 Stage IV Neuroblastoma Treatment, Eleven Years Experience Hospital De Ninos Ricardo Gutierrez Buenos Aires Argentina A. Capital Federal, Argentina; 2Hospital de Ni\u00f1os Ricardo Gutierrez, Pathology, Capital Federal, Argentina Background/Objectives: To describe clinic, biologic and histological features and overall survival(OS) of patients(p) with stage IV (SIV) NBL treated Unit, Buenos Aires Argentina. Design/Methods: A retrospective and descriptive analysis of medical records from p with SIV NBL admitted between April 1st 2004 to December 31st 2015. Variables evaluated were sex, age, primary site, tumor size, histology, Nmyc status, urinary catecholamines status, treatment, and overall survival. After diagnosis p received chemotherapy induction with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, cisplatin, VP16. Local resection was performed follow by high doses chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation; primary tumorbed radiotherapy and retinoic acid as maintenance. KaplanMeier method analysis was used to determine overall survival(OS) Results: Sixtysix p were diagnosed with NBL, 29(44%) were stage IV NBL. Average age at presentation was 14.4 month, ratio men:women 3:1. Primary site was adrenal tumor size was poorly differentiated NBL (24%), Nmyc status by fish was performed in twenty tumor samples, amplified in 50%. Thirteen (44,8%) p completed treatment, 6/12p (46.1%) are alive. Sixteen p did not complete treatment and die due tumoral progression during induction (55.1%) or to infectious complications (31.2%), which most take place before 2008. Relapsed get 51%, from which bone marrow represented 20%. Conclusions: Results obtained indicate that 50% of studied patients with stage IV NBT presented Nmyc amplification. Global OS is 17.3% For patients who reach complete treatment OS is 46.1%, comparable with results of international cooperative groups. In addition, an improvement in survival is observed associated with an amelioration in healthcare in the last years. P-149 Exploring the Genomic Profiles of Neuroblastomas by Comparative Analysis of Exome Sequencing Versus aCGH L.O. Baumbusch1 1Oslo University Hospital Rikshospitalet, Department of Pediatric Research Division of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, Oslo, Norway; 2Oslo University Hospital Radiumhospitalet, Department of Pathology, Oslo, Norway; 3University of Oslo, Medical Faculty Institute of Clinical Medicine, Oslo, Norway Background/Objectives: Next generation sequencing will contribute to personalized pediatric oncology in the near future, in particular for biologically and clinically heterogeneous diseases requiring multimodal therapeutic approaches like neuroblastoma (NB) one of the major challenges in pediatric oncology. In NB specific copy number variations and rearrangements of single genes have been reported including amplification of MYCN (20%) and mutations of the ALK gene. We hypothesize that comparative genomic analysis of mutations and copy number variations will provide novel information about genes and signalling pathways relevant for the heterogeneity and relapse in highrisk NB. Design/Methods: Samples of tumor and normal DNA from highrisk NB patients (n=20) are available from an existing diagnostic biobank. Clinical and pathological information like age and histopathology are known from routine diagnostics. Additionally, FISH analyses have determined MYCN amplification status and possible chromosomal losses of 1p and 11q, and gain of 17q. Samples of the primary tumors were analyzed by whole exome sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq2500 platform with a mean coverage of 300. Additionally, the same DNA samples were investigated by array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) applying the Affymetrix SNP platform (CytoScan HD Results: Preliminary results reveal a high concordance between aCGH profiles and copy number information provided by sequencing. Detailed studies were performed to investigate specific genomic biomarkers. Further, we studied cancer mutation hotspots or predicted driver mutations and mutational signatures in these samples. Conclusions: Our project represents the first exome sequencing approach on NB in Norway. We have compared array and sequencing data to the expression of relevant genes and will enlarge our cohort with samples during different time points of treatment. We expect that these data will reveal novel insights into the genomics of NB and finally pave the way towards geneticclinical cancer platforms for actionable gene targets. P-150 Cytotoxic Activity of Difluoromethylornithine Compared with Fenretinide in Neuroblastoma Cell Lines M. Makena 1, H. Cho1, Nguyen1, C.P. Reynolds1 1Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Cancer Center, Lubbock, USA Background/Objectives: Maintenance therapy with 13cisretinoic acid and immunotherapy (given after completion of intensive cytotoxic therapy) improves outcome for highrisk neuroblastoma patients. The synthetic retinoid fenretinide (4HPR) achieved multiple complete responses in relapse/refractory neuroblastoma in earlyphase clinical trials, has low systemic toxicity, and has been considered for maintenance therapy clinical trials. Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO, an irreversible inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase with minimal single agent clinical response data) is being used for maintenance therapy of neuroblastoma. We evaluated the cytotoxic activity of DFMO and fenretinide in neuroblastoma cell lines. Design/Methods: We tested sixteen neuroblastoma cell lines in bone marrow hypoxia (5% O2) TUNEL flow cytometry. Results: At clinically achievable levels (100 M), DFMO significantly decreased (P < 0.05) polyamine putrescine (measured by HPLCmass spectrometry) and achieved modest cytotoxicity (< 1 log (90% cytotoxicity). Prolonged exposures (7 days) or culture in 2% and 20% O2 did not enhance DFMO cytotoxicity. At clinically achievable levels (30 M) fenretinide induced multilog cell kills (> 3 logs (99.9% cytotoxicity) in all neuroblastoma cell lines tested. Even at lower concentrations (10 M) fenretinide induced > 1 log cytotoxicity in fourteen cell lines tested. DFMO did not show a significant increase (P > 0.05) in apoptosis (TUNEL assay). Apoptosis by fenretinide was significantly higher 0.001) compared to DFMO or controls. Conclusions: DFMO as a single agent has minimal cytotoxic activity for neuroblastoma. P-151 Evolving Biopsy Techniques for Neuroblastoma in Children E. Rosenfeld 1, G. Campagna1, Y. Yu1, S. Vasudevan1, J. Nuchtern1, E. Kim1, S. Commander1, B. NaikMathuria1 1Baylor College of Medicine, Surgery, Houston, USA Background/Objectives: In order to obtain adequate tissue for diagnosis and tissue banking of neuroblastoma, surgical wedge biopsy is commonly performed. In the past decade, our experience with percutaneous needle core biopsy has evolved. The purpose of this study was to compare the adequacy and safety of biopsy techniques. Design/Methods: Following IRBapproval, we retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent biopsy for intermediate or highrisk neuroblastoma at our institution between 20112016 (recent cohort). Procedure details and outcomes were collected. Statistical analysis was performed using Wilcoxon rank tests with a pvalue<0.05 considered significant. Data from the recent cohort was compared to previously published data from 20022010 (historic cohort). Results: Since 2011, percutaneous ultrasoundguided needle core biopsy has been more commonly utilized (47% [16/34] recent cohort vs 34% [11/32] historic). The majority (94%) of percutaneous biopsies were performed by a surgeon with intravenous access port placement under the same anesthetic. The number of needle core samples obtained increased from median 7 (historic cohort) to 25 (recent cohort). Of the surgical cases, 61% were laparoscopic (previously all were open), and one patient had laparoscopicassisted percutaneous needle core biopsy. Biopsy adequacy in the recent cohort was similar in percutaneous and surgical specimens (94% percutaneous vs 89% surgical; p=1), with improved adequacy of specimens compared to historic cohort (71% percutaneous vs 100% surgical). Transfusion requirements (13% other complications (0% vs 17% surgical, p=) were higher following surgical biopsy. Operative time, hospital length of stay, and time to chemotherapy initiation were similar. Larger tumors were more likely to have a percutaneous biopsy (82\u00b137 cm percutaneous vs 47\u00b129 cores are obtained, surgeonperformed percutaneous needle core biopsy is adequate for complete tissue diagnosis of neuroblastoma and can be safely performed. This can be considered as an alternative to surgical wedge biopsy. P-152 Is Reck Gene Polymorphism is Linked with Predisposition and Prognosis of Wilms' Tumor? A Case Control Study M.R. Safarinejad 1 1Clinical center for urological disease diagnosis and private clinic specialized in urological and andrological genetics Tehran Iran, Urology, Terhran, Iran Background/Objectives: The reversioninducingcysteinerich protein with Kazal motifs (RECK) gene is a new transformation suppressor gene that was linked to some malignancies. We examined the association between RECK gene polymorphisms and the clinicopathologic characteristics of Wilms' Two single (rs10972727 and rs11788747) were analyzed using PCRRFLP protocol. The study subjects included 87 patients with Wilms' tumor and 174 healthy subjects as controls (1:2 ratio). We gathered patients with Wilms' tumor within last 2 decade. Results: For rs10972727 polymorphism, the genotype frequency distributions were in HardyWeinberg equilibrium in patients (2 = 3.2, P = 0.062, P = 0.72) and controls (2 = 2.2, P = 1.77, P = 0.84). A significant alteration in both genotype distribution and allele frequency between Wilms' tumor patients and healthy controls were detected for rs10972727 SNP. There was a statistically significant association between the presence of C allele and the Wilms' tumor (OR = 5.02, 95% CI: 2.87 -8.31; P = 0.001). According to the logistic regression analysis, Wilms' tumor patients with RECK TC and CC genotype have a 3.82fold, and 3.73fold for Wilms' tumor (OR = 3.82, 95% CI: 2.42-7.71; P = 0.006, and OR = 2.83 -7.63; P = 0.002, respectively. rs11788747 polymorphism: Both the patients and control subjects were in HardyWeinberg equilibrium for the rs11788747 SNP polymorphism (2 = 2.2, P = 0.056, P = 0.73; 2 = 2.2 = 0.054, P = 0.61). In single locus analysis, genotype distribution and allele frequency did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference between the cases and controls. We did not find a significant association between the rs11788747 polymorphism genotypes and the Wilms' tumor. Conclusions: We found statistically significant differences in genotype distribution and allelic frequencies in RECK gene between Wilms' tumor patients and controls for the rs10972727 SNP. P-153 Primary Yolk SAC Tumor of the Prostate in Children M.R. Safarinejad 1 1Clinical center for urological disease diagnosis and private clinic specialized in urological and andrological genetics Tehran Iran, Urology, Terhran, Iran Background/Objectives: yolk sac (endodermal sinus) tumors (ESTs) are rare malignancies that most commonly driven from the testes or ovaries. To our best knowledge, only six cases of prostatic ESTs have been reported until now in the literature. Design/Methods: In the last 2 decade, we have had six cases of prostatic ESTs. In this manuscript we report our experiences with this rare neoplasms and a brief literature review has also be done. All of the cases have underwent six courses of cisplatinbased combination chemotherapy followed by same session retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, cystoprostatectomy and ileal conduit urinary diversion. Results: None of the cases had a history of previous testis cancer and all of them were primary. At the presentation 4 (66.6%) of patients had metastatic disease, most commonly to the liver. When patient had on localized tumor in the lung or liver, they were also removed surgically. The median free of tumor survival was 36\u00b14.6 months. Two patients died rapidly within 6month of diagnosis. Both of them had metastatic diseases during presentations. Conclusions: Despite significant advances in imaging and treatment modalities during the last two decade, yolk sac tumor of the prostate remained a significant challenge for physicians dealing with these children. P-154 Hemorrhagic Brain Metastases in Neuroblastoma S. of the cases, neuroblastoma (NB) presents with metastases mostly at skeletal and bone marrow level. Involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) is rare and usually associated with metastases of theca, skull base and orbit. The occurrence of CNS parenchymal localizations is an exceptional event with dismal prognostic outcome. Design/Methods: We have recently observed two cases of stage 4 MYCNamplified NBs who have developed parenchymal CNS metastases during the clinical course. Results: Both were treated according to HRNBL01 protocol. Symptoms at relapse were severe headache and vomiting for both patients. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Computed Tomography (CT) performed at time of relapse suggested the hemorrhagic nature of the lesions, that were localized in the temporal and cerebellar lobes, respectively. CNS relapses were documented at stop therapy in the former patient, three months later in the latter. The hemorrhagic characteristics of the lesions made difficult to immediate recognize their tumoral nature, as several causes (i.e., vascular malformation, posttraumatic lesion, iatrogenic damage) may have the identical imaging features. 18FDOPAPET/CT was performed in both patients showing intense peripheral uptake of the tracer at the level of the hemorrhagic lesions. In the former patient surgery was avoided in favor of chemotherapeutic approach consisting of multiple subsequent regimens that did not prohibit slow disease progression with death ensuing nine months later. In the latter the relapse was confirmed histologically following incomplete neurosurgical removal of the mass. She is alive on Temozolomide treatment two months after surgery. Conclusions: The detection of CNS parenchymal metastases in NB patients, both at diagnosis and during the clinical course, is rare. MRI is the method of choice for studying brain lesions. In case of hemorrhagic lesions, 18FDOPAPET/CT appears a more sensitive tool as it may help to clarify earlier their tumoral nature. P-155 Synchronous Neoplasias in Patients Diagnosed with Peripheral Neuroblastic Tumors S. Sorrentino 1, C. Manzitti1, Pediatric Oncohematology Padova, Background/Objectives: Patients diagnosed with a Peripheral Neuroblastic Tumor (PNT) may occasionally develop a secondary tumor. Instead, the detection of a synchronous malignancy in these patients is much rarer and mainly occurs in subjects harboring a cancer predisposition condition, such as BeckwithWiedemann (SBW) or LiFraumeni syndromes. the period 19762016, a total of 3942 NPTs cases have been enrolled in the Italian Neuroblastoma Registry. Of them, 35 developed a secondary tumor and other 6 had a synchronous tumor. Results: Histology of PNT in the latter 6 cases was neuroblastoma in 3, intermixed ganglioneuroblastoma in 2 and ganglioneuroma in one. Synchronous tumors include acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in 3, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), pilocytic astrocytoma and pancreatoblastoma (PB) in one case each. SBW was present in the patient diagnosed with PB. All patients had localized PNT disease. Five underwent tumor resection as only therapy, while in the sixth one tumor regressed spontaneously. The 4 children diagnostic with leukemia were treated according to specific protocols, while radical tumor surgery was performed in patients with PB and astrocytoma. All these 6 patients are presently in complete remission with a median followup of 38 months (range, 2114). Conclusions: The observation of these 6 cases illustrates a clinical condition of rare occurrence but worth of being better understood. More information may derived through retrospective and/or studies on larger patient populations, as SIOPEN might offer. P-156 Immunotherapy in the Treatment of Pediatric Patients with High Risk Neuroblastoma \"An Education Program for Patients and Their Parents\" A. van Rooijen 1, The Netherlands Background/Objectives: Since August 2016, the PMC has started with the antiGD2 therapy for patients with high risk neuroblastoma significant side effects such as pain, hypotension, fever, hypersensitivity reactions and capillary leak syndrome. Pediatric oncology nurses make a significant contribution in the treatment, including education of families and patients receiving this therapy. Design/Methods: This study investigates which aspects are important for education about immunotherapy and whether this education is appropriate for children between the age of 1 and 8 years old. Based on analysis of studies regarding education of young children, existing educational materials of the DCOG are evaluated and several points of improvement are proposed. Results: Additionally, a brochure has been developed which includes aspects of treatment, logistics and side effects and the issuance of an extensive and informative film for young children undergoing the immunotherapy is scheduled for October 2017. Conclusions: Clear communication with patients about the expected toxicities, as well as proactive and comprehensive supportive care, are integral components to ensure successful completion of antibody infusions[2]. Wellinformed parents and children experience less stress, which enhances the collaboration between parents, their children and the medical team. For this reason, proper education of patients and their families in this intense antiGD2 therapy is crucial. [1] Alice, L., Yu, M., Andrew, L., Gilman, M., & al, e. (2010, September 30).

Most neuroblastomas excrete catecholamine metabolites, however, their correlation with prognosis has hardly been investigated. Therefore, we performed an indepth analysis of a panel of elevated urinary catecholamine metabolites and their correlation with prognosis. Design/Methods: Retrospective study of a panel of 8 urinary catecholamine metabolites in test (n = 96) and validation (n = 205) cohorts of patients with neuroblastoma (all stages) at diagnosis. Results: Multivariate Cox regression model analyses revealed that 3methoxytyramine (3MT) was an independent risk factor for Eventfree survival (EFS) and Overall survival (OS). EFS and OS of stage 4 patients with nonelevated 3MT were significantly better compared to stage 4 patients 3MT < 0.001]. Also in other clinical subgroups, elevated 3MT was associated with poor survival outcome. In multivariateanalyses for high risk patients (stage 4 and older than 1 year or any patients with MYCN amplification), only age and 3MT were independent risk factors for EFS and OS, and thus independent of the given therapy. Among high risk patients, those with elevated 3MT and age 18 months had an extremely poor prognosis compared to patients with nonelevated 3MT and age < 18 [5years EFS of 15.2%\u00b14% and 62.2%\u00b118%, respectively, p = 0.005; 5years OS of and 87.5%\u00b112%, respectively, p = 0.002]. Conclusions: elevated 3MTlevels at diagnosis are associated with high risk disease and poor prognosis. For high risk patients, age and elevated 3MT at diagnosis are the most significant risk factor for EFS and OS. 3MT was also able to identify subgroups of high risk patients with favorable and extremely poor prognosis.

P-158 Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition in Patients with Neuroblastoma - The Mechanism Underlying Catecholamine Negative Neuroblastoma? I. Verly A. van van Versteeg2,4, van Nes4, Pediatric Amsterdam, 2Princess for Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Utrecht, The Netherlands; 3Academic Medical Center, Laboratory Genetic Metabolic Diseases, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; 4Academic Medical Center, Oncogenomics, Amsterdam, The Netherlands Background/Objectives: Catecholamine measurements in urine of patients with neuroblastoma is standard practice. When a panel of 8 markers is used, 5% of the patients have no elevated catecholamines at diagnosis (catecholamine negative), and 20% of the patients is negative at time of relapse. Recently, two cell types in neuroblastoma were identified, adrenergic (ADRN)type cells expressing markers of adrenergiclineage differentiation, and mesenchymal (MES)type cells lacking these markers (van Groningen et al., submitted). This phenotypical duality might regulate catecholamine excretion and explain the switch of catecholamine positive to catecholamine negative patients. In this study, we investigated in vitro catecholamine excretion in relation to MES and ADRN cell types. Design/Methods: We studied catecholamine excretion in neuroblastoma cell lines (6 MES and 23 ADRN), including two pairs of ADRNMES cell lines (SY5YSHEP2 and 691B691T). Additionally, SKNBE cells, in which mesenchymal transition can be induced were also used. Subsequently, the presence of the catecholamine lines was determined by qRTPCR and Westernblot. Results: Among the 23 ADRN cell lines, 10 cell lines (44%) excreted catecholamines. MES cell lines did not excrete catecholamines. the ADRNMES pairs, the ADRN cell lines excreted catecholamines, while their MES cell lines partner did not. Catecholamine excretion was also detected in SKNBE cells with ADRN phenotype, however, it stopped once transition to mesenchymal phenotype was induced. Enzyme profiling revealed that all the excreting cell lines expressed the TH protein, which was absent in all the nonexcreting cell lines. Conclusions: Catecholamine excretion was absent in MEStype neuroblastoma cells and seems to be an exclusive feature of the ADRNcells with TH expression.

Wang2 1Children's Hospital Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Department of Ultrasound, Hangzhou, China; 2Children's Hospital Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Department of Surgical Oncology, Hangzhou, China Background/Objectives: To investigate the efficacy of ultrasonography in our center from November 2004 to February 2017 were included in this study, including 16 boys and 12 girls. All cases were unilateral. Ultrasonographic image data were analyzed retrospectively. Results: All cases were detected by ultrasound firstly, aged from 34w gestational age to 28 days postpartum, 13(46.43%) cases detected during prenatal routine examination. Major ultrasonographic characteristics: border clear, size of mass from 2.7cm * 1.7cm * 1.7cm to 12.0cm * 11.0cm * 7.5cm, 24 cases were parenchymal masses (19 cases with calcification, 5 cases without calcification), 2 cases were cystic masses, 2 cases were cystic solid masses. NB was considered as the first diagnosis in 27 cases (96.4%). Only 1 case of cystic adrenal neuroblastoma was misdiagnosed as mesenteric cyst. Conclusions: Ultrasound can be used as a preferred imaging method for fetal and neonatal adrenal neuroblastoma, which contributes to early diagnosis and management. P-160 Paraneoplastic Syndromes - A Retrospective Clinical Analysis of 8 Cases in Children S. Wang 1, Z. Lu1, C. Li1, C. Yang1, L. Lv1, Z. Zhao1 1Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Department of Pediatric Surgical Oncology, Chongqing, China Background/Objectives: Paraneoplastic Syndromes (PSs) are the kinds of rare syndromes, the clinical characteristics have rarely been discussed in children. We analyzed data on the clinical manifestations, diagnoses, treatments, and prognosis in children with PSs to investigate how diagnosis and treatment could be improved. Design/Methods: Eight patients with PSs were enrolled from July 2011 to February 2017. A range of examinations were used to evaluate the patients. Pathological examinations were performed on all of the patients. In addition to either complete tumor resection or puncture biopsy, chemotherapy, corticosteroid therapy and other supportive treatments were also applied in the different patients. Results: Three patients suffered from paraneoplastic neurologic syndromes (PNSs), 3 presented with Ectopic Cushing's syndrome, 1 patient with respiratory failure and 1 had vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)induced intractable diarrhea. Two patients were confirmed as ganglioneuroblastoma (GNB), 4 had neuroblastoma (NB) and 2 had ganglioneuroma(GN). In 6 patients the tumors were completely resected, 2 had puncture biopsy of the tumors. Six patients received chemotherapy, 4 received futher supportive treatments, and 4 received futher corticosteroid therapy. Except for 2 patients who discontinued therapy, the 3 patients who suffered from PNSs achieved complete remission, and the remaining 4 patients who completed followup were classified as having \"very good partial remission\". Conclusions: When children present with PNSs as (OMS) and Cerebellar Ataxia, Ectopic syndrome, dyspnea and unexplained intractable diarrhea, hypokalemia and dysplasia, clinicians should consider the possibility of neuroblastoma. P-161 A DoubleConditioning Regimen with Thiotepa J. Hara4, K. Matsumoto3 1Keio University School of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Tokyo, Japan; 2National Cancer Center Research Institute, Department of Clinical Genomics, Tokyo, Japan; 3National Center for Child Health and Development, Children's Cancer Center, Tokyo, Japan; 4Osaka City General Hospital, Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Osaka, Japan Background/Objectives: Appropriate combinations of induction chemotherapy and highdose chemotherapy (HDC) regimens for patients with highrisk neuroblastoma remain unestablished. Previously, we reported the feasibility and efficacy of a doubleconditioning regimen using two cycles of thiotepa (total 800 mg/m2) and melphalan (total 280 mg/m2) with a single grafting for neuroblastoma. In the present study, we analyzed the outcomes of the doubleconditioning regimen in patients with highrisk neuroblastoma in two Japanese institutions. Design/Methods: The medical records of consecutive 34 patients with highrisk neuroblastoma who received the doubleconditioning regimen followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell rescue between 2002 and 2012 were reviewed. Results: The median patient age at diagnosis was 35 months. MYCNamplified tumors were observed in 19 patients. Thirtytwo patients had stage 4 tumors. All patients underwent surgical resection of the primary lesion and radiotherapy against the residual lesion. The regimen of induction chemotherapy and timing of surgery varied depending on the institution. The median followup period was 8.6 years (range, 4.8-14.1). Nine patients subsequently received planned tandem HDC with cord blood transplantation. Fifteen patients, including 2 of the 9 patients treated with tandem HDC, have survived without recurrence. The eventfree survival (EFS) rate and the overall survival (OS) rate at 5 years from diagnosis was 47.1% \u00b1 8.6% and 52.9% \u00b1 8.6%, respectively. Three patients died from regimenrelated toxicity. None of the patients developed secondary malignancies. Notably, both the EFS and OS rates at 5 years in patients with MYCNamplified tumors were 68.4% \u00b1 10.7%, which were significantly superior to those with MYCNnonamplified tumors (P < 0.01 and P = 0.014). In a multivariate analysis, increased probability of EFS was demonstrated in patients with MYCNamplification and good remission status during HDC. Conclusions: The doubleconditioning regimen comprising thiotepa and melphalan is an effective regimen patients MYCN C. yang 1, W. shan2 1Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Department of Pediatric surgical oncology, Chongqing, China; 2hildren's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Department of Pediatric surgical oncology, chongqing, China Background/Objectives: The transcriptional essential for Hippo pathwaydriven tumorigenesis in various cancers. However, the expression and function of YAP in neuroblastoma remains elusive. Here, we show that YAP was highly expressed in Neuroblastoma (NB) and expression levels correlated with advanced tumor staging. Design/Methods: We examined the expression of YAP in clinical tumor specimens and adjacent tissues, and analyzed the relationship between them and tumor staging. The cell viability assay, colony formation assay and Invasion assay were perfomed after siRNA interfering. The expression of YAP and possibly related downstream proteins was detected by westerblot. Human SHSY5Y and SHSY5YR xenografts were established, low concentration of cisplatin, high concentration of cisplatin, low concentration of cisplatin + peptid 17 was treated for each group. Tumor volume was calculated. After mice were sacrificed, the tumor were peeled off and weighted, YAP expression and apoptosis was performed. Results: Knockdown of YAP significantly impaired neuroblastoma proliferation, tumorigenesis, and invasion in vitro. Injection of the YAP inhibitor, Peptide 17, dramatically prevented neuroblastoma subcutaneous tumor growth by efficiently downregulating YAP expression in tumors. Additionally, less proliferative and more apoptotic cells were found in the Peptide 17 treatment group. Furthermore, YAP inhibition significantly inhibited cisplatinresistant neuroblastoma proliferation, tumorigenesis, and invasion in vitro. The combination of Peptide 17 with lowdose cisplatin efficiently impaired cisplatinresistant NB subcutaneous tumor growth, being as effective as highdose cisplatin. Notably, the combination therapy caused lesser liver toxicity in mice compared to the highdose cisplatin treatment group. Conclusions: Collectively, this work identifies YAP as a novel regulator of neuroblastoma proliferation, tumorigenesis, and invasion and indicates that YAP is a potential therapeutic target for cisplatinresistant neuroblastoma. P-163 An Evaluation of The Risk Factors in the Surgical Treatment of IntermediateRisk Neuroblastoma A. Yoneda 1, K. Santo1, Nakaoka1, T. Nakamura2, J. 1Osaka City General Hospital, Pediatric Surgery, Osaka, Japan; 2Osaka General Medical Center, Pediatric Surgery, Osaka, Japan; 3Osaka City General Hospital, Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Osaka, Japan Background/Objectives: With improvement in the treatment results for intermediaterisk neuroblastoma, minimizing treatment complications should be the top priority. We retrospectively evaluated the risk factors in the surgical treatment of intermediaterisk neuroblastoma in order to minimize surgical complications. Design/Methods: Of 148 neuroblastoma patients treated at our institute between 1995 and 2016, 15 classified as intermediaterisk according to the COG risk classification were selected. We divided these patients into two groups according to the presence (group A, n=6) or absence (group B, n=9) of surgical complications. Results: The median age at diagnosis was 7 months (range: 5 days3 years). There were 13 INSS stage 3 patients, 2 stage 4 and 1 stage 4S. Eight had retroperitoneal, five adrenal, two mediastinal and one cervical neuroblastomas. Four tumors showed intraspinal extension. The surgical complications were two nephrectomies, one renal atrophy, one bowel obstruction, one ejaculation disorder, one Horner syndrome and one resection of the internal jugular vein. All tumors were resected at least 95% in group A, including 5 complete resections, whereas there were 2 complete resections, three 90% and 50%90% resections each and 1 patient without surgery in group B. Five of the six patients in group A and five of the nine patients in group B had tumors with imagedefined risk factors (IDRFs). Only one tumor in group B changed from 'IDRFs present' to 'not present' after preoperative chemotherapy. All patients were alive without disease after a median followup 143 months (range: 13242 months). Conclusions: More than 95% resection and the presence of preoperative IDRFs seems to be surgical risk factors in intermediaterisk neuroblastoma. As all patients are alive without disease, conservative surgery to avoid complications may be acceptable, even if residual tumor remains after surgery. P-164 The Role of UBE4B in Neuroblastoma Differentiation P. Zage 1, J. Lesperance1, S. Hakim1 1University of California San Diego Moores Cancer Center, Pediatrics, San Diego, USA; 2Baylor College of Medicine, Pediatric Surgery, Houston, USA; 3University of AlabamaBirmingham, Pathology, Birmingham, USA; 4University of Texas Health Science Center Houston, Neurobiology & Anatomy, Houston, USA; 5Baylor College of Medicine, Pathology, Houston, USA Background/Objectives: UBE4B is an E3/E4 ubiquitin ligase involved in growth factor receptor (GFR) trafficking whose gene is found in the chromosome 1p36 region commonly deleted in highrisk neuroblastoma tumors. We have previously observed associations of UBE4B gene and protein expression with neuroblastoma patient outcomes and neuroblastoma tumor histology. However, the functional roles of UBE4B in neuroblastoma tumor differentiation are not known. Design/Methods: We screened cell lines and neuroblastoma tumor samples for UBE4B protein expression using Western blot and quantitative immunohistochemistry and analyzed the association of UBE4B gene expression with expression of known markers of neuroblastoma tumor differentiation using publicly available databases. We measured UBE4B expression by Western blot in cell lines before and after induction of differentiation with retinoic acid treatment and determined the effects of UBE4B overexpression and depletion on retinoic acidinduced differentiation using continuous livecell imaging of neurite morphology, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot for markers of differentiation. Effects on signaling through the Ras/MAPK pathway were measured using Western blots. Results: UBE4B expression was associated with differentiation in patient tumor samples, and UBE4B gene and protein expression were associated with expression levels of known markers of neuroblastoma differentiation. Retinoic acid treatment resulted in increased UBE4B expression in retinoic acidsensitive, but not resistant, neuroblastoma cells, and UBE4B depletion was associated with increased phosphorylation of ERK, increased proliferation, and inhibition of retinoic acidinduced neuroblastoma differentiation. Conclusion: We have demonstrated associations between UBE4B expression and tumor cell differentiation in gene expression databases and in neuroblastoma tumor samples, and our data suggests that UBE4B expression is required for retinoic acidinduced differentiation, potentially through effects on ERK activation. These associations between UBE4B and neuroblastoma differentiation combined with the established role of UBE4B in GFR trafficking suggest that UBE4Bmediated receptor trafficking may contribute to the responses of neuroblastoma tumors to therapy and to the outcomes of patients with neuroblastoma. P-165 Treatment of HighRisk Neuroblastoma Over One Year of Age with Intensive and a Novel Delayed Intensification Chemotherapy Y.T. Zhang1, J. Chang 1, X.D. Zhong1 1First Hospital of Jilin University, Department of pediatric oncology, Changchun, China Background/Objectives: Current \"standard\" therapy for patients with highrisk neuroblastoma consists of intensive induction chemotherapy and surgery, myeloablative consolidation chemotherapy, autologous stem cell transplantation, local irradiation and immunotherapy. However, autologous stemcell transplantation is expensive. Until recently, antiGD2 antibody was not easily accessible in China. What should we do to improve the survival rate of patients with highrisk neuroblastoma in developing countries? On the basis of these considerations, we designed this study to test the feasibility of adding a novel delayed intensification chemotherapy to a doseintensive induction regimen. Design/Methods: Patients enrolled in this study received chemotherapy in accordance with the design of the NB97 trial. At the end of the therapy, patients received three cycles of delayed intensification chemotherapy. The delayed intensification chemotherapy consists of two A1 and one A2 cycle. The A1 cycle consists of 1.5 mg/m2 of vincristine on day 1, 1.2 g/m2 of cyclophosphamide on day 2, 100 mg/m2 of cisplatin on day 3, and 160 mg/m2 of etoposide on day 4. The A2 cycle is similar to the A1 cycle, however the only difference is that on day 4, 30 mg/m2 of doxorubicin is substituted for etoposide. Results: Between 2008 to 2011, a total of 51 patients were enrolled, 15 patients were excluded from the study. Of the remaining thirtysix patients, twentyeight patients had completed consolidation chemotherapy. They were finally enrolled. Fifteen patients were long term eventfree survivors. Five patients were alive with tumor whilst eight patients died. The 3year EFS and OS were 53.6% respectively. Conclusions: A high rate of survival among patients with highrisk neuroblastoma was achieved with delayed intensification chemotherapy without the occurrence of a second malignancy. This study warrants further investigation into the longterm outcomes and EFS in patients with highrisk neuroblastoma. P-166 PLK4 Promotes Neuroblastoma Invasion and Metastasis Through PI3K/AKT Signaling Pathway Q. Zhao 1 1Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Department of Pediatric Cancer, Tianjin, China Background/Objectives: Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common malignant tumor in infancy and the most common extracranial solid tumor in childhood. With the improvement of diagnosis and treatment, the survival rate of patients with lowrisk and intermediaterisk NB can reach up to 90%. But for highrisk NBs, the longterm survival rate is still less than 40%. The pathogenesis of NB is still not explicit, therefore it is of great significance to explore the mechanism of NB tumorigenesis and discovery new therapeutic targets for NB. PLK4, one of the Pololike kinase family members, is an important regulator of centriole replication. The abnormal expression of PLK4 was found in several cancers and a recent study has unraveled a novel function of PLK4 as a mediator of invasion and metastasis in Hela cell lines. However, the function of PLK4 in NB development and progression remains to be elucidated. Design/Methods: We evaluated the expression level of PLK4 in NB tissues and detected the function of PLK4 in NB through a series of experiments in vitro and in vivo. Results: The expression level of PLK4 in NB tissues was remarkably upregulated and high expression of PLK4 was negatively correlated with the survival rate of NBs, which suggesting that PLK4 was a potential tumor promoting factor of NB. Functional studies indicated downregulation of PLK4 suppressed cell proliferation and invasion in SKNSH and SKNBE(2) cells. And downregulated PLK4 in NB cell lines inhibited epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT) through the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Animal experiments demonstrated that PLK4 downregulation in SKNBE(2) cells dramatically suppressed tumorigenesis and metastasis. PLK4 promotes cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis in NB cells and it induces epithelialmesenchymal transition by activation of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. PLK4 may be a promising therapeutic target for NB. Solid Non Brain Tumours Renal Tumours P-167 Outcome of Wilms Tumor Treated According to the SIOP PODC Approach: Early Experience in a Tertiary Referral Hospital in the Philippines J.P. Caneba 1, A. Alcasabas1 1University the Philippines Philippine General Hospital, Pediatrics, Manila, Philippines; 2University of the Philippines Philippine General Hospital, Surgery, Manila, Philippines; 3University of the Philippines Philippine General Hospital, Pathology, Manila, Philippines; 4University of the Philippines Philippine General Hospital, Radiology, Manila, Philippines Background/Objectives: At Philippine General Hospital, the country's national referral center, Wilms tumor (WT) survival was low at 26% largely due to treatment delays and abandonment from inoperable tumors and infections. In March 2014, the pediatric surgery, pediatric oncology, pathology, and radiology group adopted the SIOPPODC WT treatment approach and guidelines. Design/Methods: Review of medical records of newlydiagnosed patients from March 2014 to August 2016 with study endpoint at December 2016. Results: There were 22 patients with mean age of 2.5 years (0.3311). M:F ratio of 1:2.3. Eighteen patients (82%) had localized disease and 4 (18%) were metastatic. All were given neoadjuvant chemo for mean of 6 weeks, (411) and 9 weeks (811), respectively. Only 20 patients had nephrectomy due to abandonment (1) and progressive disease (1). 19 patients (95%) had lymph node sampling and 2 (9%) had tumor spillage. Surgical staging High: 5. Favorable histology, and 3 were misdiagnoses: neuroblastoma (1), Angiomyolipoma (1) and renal dysplasia (1). Thirteen WT patients received SIOP riskstratified adjuvant treatment, 4 were off protocol due to poor response (N=3) and progressive disease (N=1), and 1 abandoned treatment. Six patients underwent radiation. At study endpoint, for WT patients: 9 (47%) abandoned therapy; 1 (5%) relapsed (local); and 1 died due to gastroenteritis 12 months off treatment. The 2 year EFS is 57%, and 2 year OS and abandonment sensitive OS are 89% and 63%, respectively. Conclusions: The adoption of the SIOPPODC WT multidisciplinary protocol and guidelines has markedly improved survival in our setting and addressed diagnostic and treatment delays. However, efforts are still needed to curb abandonment, and improve protocol adherence and misdiagnosis. P-168 Outcome of Wilms' Tumor in Children: A 10 Year Experience From King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research CenterRiyadh A. Ali1, M. Ayas1, T. AlHussain2, S. Mohammad2, I. Alfawaz 1 1King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre, Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; 2King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre, Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; 3King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre, Pediatric Surgery, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; 4King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre, Nursing, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; 5King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research CentreJeddah, Oncology, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia Background/Objectives: Wilms' tumor (WT) is the most common renal malignancy in children. Outcome data for WT in our region is limited. A retrospective study to evaluate clinical outcomes of pediatric patients (pts) with WT at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, Riyadh (KFSH&RCRiyadh) was conducted. Design/Methods: Data of WT pts (ages 0 to 14 years) diagnosed and treated at KFSH&RCRiyadh from 20012011 was reviewed. Only histopathology confirmed cases were included. Results: Out of 137 cases identified, 7 cases were excluded due to insufficient data. Median age at diagnosis was 3.4 years (0.313). with 73(56%) females and 57(44%) males. Unilateral disease was observed in 119(91.5%)pts and bilateral in 11(9.5%). Presenting features pain,41.5%; IV,29(22%). Relapse was seen in 34(26%); of which 23(68%) were Stage III and IV. Fiveyear OS for all was 90.5% P value of <0.05 for EFS in pts based on staging. Our results corroborate previously presented data from the Saudi Arabian Pediatric Hematology/Oncology Society(SAPHOS) where a national 5year OS and EFS of 86% and 74% respectively (n=67) was reported. Favorable histology was seen in 119(91.5%) while 7(5%) had anaplasia. P value for both OS and EFS was <0.05 for pts comparing favorable histology with anaplasia. For pts <5years, OS and EFS were 93% and 71.6%, and 82% and 65.6%, for >5years of age, respectively. Conclusions: Despite variability in healthcare services and referral patterns, and given that over half of the pts being referred to our center have advanced disease, not amenable to upfront resection, our outcomes for WT are comparable tothe national data as well as to international reports. Further review including specifications of relapsed patients and molecular studies are warranted and underway. P-169 Bilateral Wilms Tumors: Treatment Results from a Single Center with Turkish Pediatric Oncology Group Wilms Tumor Study B. Aydin 1, C. Akyuz1, Yalcin1, Kurucu1, Cancer Institute, Pediatric Oncology, ANKARA, Turkey; 2Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Pediatric Surgery, ANKARA, Turkey Background/Objectives: The outcome of patients with BWT has improved due to both preoperative chemotherapy and operative techniques in preservation of renal parenchyma. In this study the results of TPOG Wilms tumor regimen for BWT and outcome of patients from a single center were retrospectively reviewed. Design/Methods: From 1990 to 2016, 33 patients with synchronous BWT were treated with preoperative chemotherapy with vincristine and actinomycine. Chemotherapy was continued until safe nephron sparing surgery (NSS) could be performed as long as radiological tumor response continued or chemotherapy was intensified with adding doxorubicin (D) alternating with VA every 6 weeks. Results: The median followup of nonfailure patients was 68 months (7297 months). The median duration of preoperative chemotherapy was 85 days ranged between 14 days and 216 days. Preoperative chemotherapy was modified in 7 patients (21%) with VAD regimen. 6 patients received VAD regimen due to metastases, thrombi in vena cava and possible spontaneous tumor rupture at diagnosis. 24 patients had radical nephrectomy for greater tumor and NSS for the contralateral kidney. Eight patients (24%) had bilateral NSS. EFS and OS rates for VA and VAD was not statistically different. Postoperative tumor stages for stage I, II and III were 55%, 15% and 17%. The 5year OS rates were 100%, 90% and 70% for stages I, II and III (p=0.06). Unfavorable histology and nephroblastomatosis were reported in 18% and 27% of patients. 5year OS and EFS rates were 50% and 25% in patients with anaplasia, while same rates were 96% and 96% in patients with FH tumors (p=0.03 and p<0.001). 10year OS and EFS rates for all patients were 84% and 80%. Only one patient died after bilateral nephrectomy. Conclusions: Our results are comparable with literature. VA is effective for BWT as initial preoperative treatment. VAD combination might help better local control for selected advanced staged tumors. P-170 Review of Phase I and II Trials for Wilms Tumour - Can We Optimise the Search for Novel Brok 1, J.I. Geller2, F. Spreafico3 1University College Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, Cancer section, London, United Kingdom; 2Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center University of Cincinnati Cincinnati Ohio, Division of Pediatric Oncology, Cincinatti, USA; 3Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Hematology and Pediatric OncoHematology, Milano, Italy Background/Objectives: Survival rates for patients with Wilms' tumour (WT) approximate 90% with refined use of currently available interventions. However, a subgroup of patients with initial highrisk histopathology or relapsing disease have a poor prognosis and it is a challenge to identify and prioritise the development of new innovative approaches for these subgroups. Design/Methods: We conducted a systematic literature search for published phase I and II clinical trials that registered patients with WTs, and characterised the earlyphase trial activity, quantified response rates and highlighted avenues for further development. Results: We identified 63 trials (48 phase I, three phase I/II, and 12 phase II trials) enrolling 214 patients with WTs, alongside other malignancies. The number of annually recruited WTs did not change significantly and was less than 20% of the potential candidates. The vast majority of the trials were conducted in North America and 56 different interventions were investigated, including conventional chemotherapy and biologicallytargeted therapies. Overall, 33 WTs revealed some degree of tumour control. Of these, five patients demonstrated complete remission (2%), 15 patients partial response (7%) and 13 patients stable disease (6%). None of the included novel biologicallytargeted therapies emerged as promising interventions and only conventional chemotherapy was able to induce a complete and partial response. Conclusions: We conclude that early phase trial recruitment of WTs is below expected and the clinical outcome of the included patients is dismal. Improvement of the availability and recruitment to earlyphase trials for WTs, especially in Europe, is needed. P-171 Single Center Study: Retrospective Study of 12 Cases of Malignant Rhabdoid Tumour of the Kidney (MRTK) in Children H.Y. Cheng 1 1Beijing Children's hospital, surgical oncology, Beijing, China Background/Objectives: To investigate the clinical characteristics and prognostic factors of malignant rhabdoid tumour of the kidney (MRTK) in children. Design/Methods: Twelve patients with MRTK were diagnosed and treated in Our hospital from January 2007 to December 2015. Variables examined were tumor stage, sex, age at diagnosis, surgical radicality, radiotherapy and chemotherapeutic regimens. Results: The median age of all cases was 15.5 months (4 to 42 months) at the time of diagnosis, 75% of patients were male. The most common presenting complaint was intraabdominal mass or pain(75%),gross hematuria (33.3%), tumor rupture(25%).8(75%)had positive lymph nodes or distant parenchymal metastases. The median followup was 22.2 months (rang 1455 months),9 died and 3 survived.The 1and 3year survival rates were 50% and 25%.the whole patients underwent surgery and chemotheropy,3 patients treated combining with radiation therapy, no significant improvement in efficacy. There were no differences in survival between males and females, or younger and older children. 3 cases survived include one of stage,2 cases of stage .One of stage III patient only underwent one cycle chemotherapy after surgery, she survived diseasefree for 43 months. Conclusions: In infants and children has a dismal prognosis, Surgical radicality seems to be of prognostic value in MRTK. Molecular diagnostics and research is warranted to refine diagnostics and classifying prognostic relevant MRTK subtypes. P-172 Malignant Paediatric Abdominal Tumors; Experience the Hospital, Lahore M. Faizan 1, Saleem2, S. Anwar1, N. Talat2, P. Najamuddin3 Lahore, Pakistan; 2The Children's Surgery, Lahore, Pakistan; 3The Children's Hospital Health, Paediatric Radiology, Lahore, Pakistan Background/Objectives: To determine the demographics, Presentation, need of any Surgical intervention and Etiology in Paediatric patients with histologically proven Malignant abdominal masses in children. Design/Methods: A retrospective observational Study carried out in the Hematology and Oncology Department at The Children's Hospital and Institute of Child Health, Lahore,Pakistan. All children with Histologically proven malignant abdominal masses from January 1st 2016 till December 31st 2016 were included. Data regarding age, gender, any surgical intervention required and final diagnosis were analyzed. Neonates, Patients with relapse and in whom diagnosis was not confirmed histologically were excluded form the study. Consecutive sampling technique was used and data analyzed using SPSS 21. Results: Total 191 children diagnosed with malignant abdominal tumor were eligible for study. Majority were male 120(63%), 14years of age 101(53%), and 59yrs of age 58(30%). Commonest presentation was abdominal distension and palpable abdominal mass 186 (97%), In majority mothers 175(91%) only noted abdominal distension while mass was clinically palpable as noted by the oncologist. Abdominal pain was present in 43(22.5%) and fever 23(12%). Diagnosis was made on trucut biopsy in 177(93%) while primary surgical intervention required in 13(7%). Etiology of malignant abdominal masses was Wilms tumor 66(34.6%), each while papillary renal cell carcinoma, undifferentiated synovial sarcoma liver was diagnosed in one patient each. Conclusions: Wilms tumor followed by Non Hodgkin Lymphoma is the most common solid Abdominal Malignancy in paediatric age group. Presentation is mostly in advanced stage with a palpable abdominal mass. Need of surgery was avoided by trucut biopsy at presentation for diagnosis. There is a need to train pediatricians and family physicians along with mothers early recognition of abdominal distension and mass for early diagnosis and better prognosis. P-173 Treatment of ExtraCranial Malignant Rhabdoid Tumor: Results from the Oncology 1, Gainsville, USA; 3Ann Hospital of Chicago, Radiation Oncology, Chicago, USA; 4MD Anderson Center, Radiology, Lincoln, USA; 6Ann and Lurie Children's of Chicago, Pathology, Chicago, USA; 7C S Mott Children's Hospital, Surgery, Ann Arbor, USA; 8DanaFarber/Harvard Cancer Center, Pediatric, Boston, USA; 9Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Pediatric, Bethesda, USA; 10MD Anderson Cancer Center, Radiation Oncology, Houston, USA; of Philadelphia, Radiation 12Seattle Children's Hospital, Surgery, Seattle, USA; Bioethics, Halifax, Canada; 18Children's National Medical Center, Pediatrics, Washington DC, USA Background/Objectives: In National Wilms Tumor Studies 15, 4year overall survival (OS) for patients with advanced malignant rhabdoid tumor (MRT) was 23%. AREN0321 evaluated a more intensive containing with cyclophosphamide, carboplatin, etoposide radiotherapy, with the goal to improve eventfree survival (EFS) and OS. Design/Methods: Patients with stages IIV extracranial MRT were eligible. The study was designed to detect an OS of 42%, using the historical OS of 25% as a fixed standard for comparison. Patients with stage IV measurable disease had the option to receive vincristine in combination with irinotecan (VI) in an upfront window. Results: 39 patients with MRT were enrolled (30 with renal,9 with extrarenal primary tumors). Median age was 11.7 months (range, 1.1109.6 months). Stage distribution was I (2), II (5), III (23), and IV (9). No tumor response was seen in the 3 patients who received VI window therapy. Among those with relapse/progression, median time to progression was 5.6 months. The 4year EFS and OS estimates for the entire cohort were both 35.9% (95% CI: 18.1%53.7%). EFS estimates according to stage were 100% each for stage I and II, 26.1% (95% for stage III and 11.1% IV. EFS estimates CI: 22%64.6%) for renal tumors and tumors. Impact of age, radiotherapy, germline INI1 status and toxicity will be evaluated. Conclusions: Regimen UH1 did not improve survival for the collective group of patients with MRT, though it may have improved outcomes for patients with lowstage disease.. There was no salvage for patients with relapse or progression. For advancedstage MRT, novel therapeutic strategies such as integration of targeted biologics in combination with chemotherapy are needed. P-174 Clear Cell SARCOMA of the Kidney (CCSK) in Pediatric Patients: A 28 Years Study from One Institution in Brazil F.N. Gutierrez1, F. Rebelo 1, R. Carvalho1, Ferman2, M. Grabois2 1Instituto de C\u00e2ncer, Pediatric Surgery, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; 2Instituto Nacional de C\u00e2ncer, Pediatric Oncology, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Background/Objectives: To retrospectively analyze pediatric patients with clear cell sarcoma of the kidney admitted to our institution from February 1987 to December 2015. Design/Methods: Case report forms of pediatric patients (age range: 10 months6 years) were retrospectively analyzed. Collected data included demographics, clinical presentation, surgical and oncology management and Follow up. Patients data were updated on March 2017. Results: Among 51 patients diagnosed with non Wilms renal tumors, 24 patients (11 boys, 13 girls) had histopathological diagnosis of CCSK. The median age at diagnosis was 29 months (range: 9 months to 6 years). Presenting symptoms included abdominal mass first noticed by the family in 70,8% of cases, 3 patients had hematuria, 1 patient had abdominal pain. The median time from initial symptoms to suspected diagnosis was 60 days (range: 1 day to 270 days). The mean tumor volume was evaluated prechemotherapy in 8/24 patients and was 644 cm3 (range: 213 to 918 cm3). No patient presented metastasis at diagnosis. Twenty four patients had radical nefrectomy either upfront (14 cases) or after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (10 cases). In 21/24 patients there was free surgical margins and in 3 cases without report. Lymphadenectomy was performed in 15 cases, of which 6 were positive. Surgical stage was: I (n=7), II (n=7) and III (n=10).Overall survival in 7 years was 73.7%. Survival by stage was: 83.3% for stage I, 62.5% for stage II was and 71% stage III. Eight patients had disease relapse: bone (n=4), brain (n=1), lung (n=1), local (n=1), bone and lung (n=1) and 5 of 8 patients died of disease. Conclusions: With multidisciplinary care, treatment result was good. There was no significant difference in survival in relation to initial stage. P-175 Surgical Management and Outcomes of Renal Tumors Among Children with IVC/Intracardiac Extension H. Halepota 1, M. Arshad1, S. khan1 1Aga Khan university, Paediatric Surgery, Karachi, Pakistan Background/Objectives: Determine outcomes of renal tumor with inferior vena cava(IVC)and intracardiac(IC)extension in our institute. These subset of patients, presents a technical challenge to surgeon especially with constrained resources. Design/Methods: Retrospective cross sectional study.All patients from 116 years of age from January 1998 till June 2016 included Results: During the study period 60 patients with renal tumors were managed. 18 (30%)patients presented with IVC and /or IC extension majority involving right kidney (13/18), most common age at presentation ranged between 15 years. Out of 18 children 55%were male and 45% were female. The level of Tumor extension into IVC was below the diaphragm in 10 (55.5%), above the diaphragm in 8 (44.44%) out of which 5 extending into IC (27.8%).Wilms tumor (83%) was the most common tumor type followed by renal cell carcinoma. Most patients 9(60%) with Wilm's tumor had IVC extension below diaphragm. 7 out of these 9 patients had no recurrence after 5 years of follow up. One had lung metastasis due to tumor spillage and one patient with stage 5 disease expired. Most (5/9) of the patients had received preoperative chemotherapy, 3 underwent direct thrombectomy. 5 patients had intraatrial extension; all received preoperative chemotherapy 2 showed no recurrence after 5 years. 2 patients had Renal cell carcinoma and 1 had Rhabdoid tumor. Conclusions: In our study 30% incidence of IVC and or IC Tumor extension is much higher than the reported series.This high incidence can be explained that many of these patients were referred from other institutions.2 patients in our study had surgical complications: In our study no patient required cardiopulmonary bypass as preoperative chemotherapy reduced the thrombus to IVC., most patients received preoperative chemotherapy as well as preoperative radiotherapy in case of metastatic disease. 61% of these patients are disease free on five years of follow up. P-176 Clinical Outcomes of Children with Wilms Tumor Treated on a Modified SIOP WT 2001 PROTOCOL and Comparison with A Historic Cohort Treated with Upfront Surgery R. John 1, J. Kurian2, L.G. Mathew1, College, Pediatric Surgery, Vellore, India Background/Objectives: To analyze the clinical profile of children with Wilms tumor treated by the modified SIOP protocol and compare with historical patients treated on the NWTS protocol Design/Methods: Clinical, radiological and biopsy data of 59 children diagnosed to have Wilms tumor from 2004 to 2014 and treated using the SIOP WT 2001 protocol, with a minor modification of preoperative posterior flank core biopsy, were collected from their medical records. The outcome of this cohort was compared with 62 children treated from 1985 - 1995 on the NWTS protocol from two centres, including our centre and reported by Sen et al. Results: The median age at diagnosis was 36 months. M: F was1:0.7. 31% had metastatic disease, reduced from 523ml to 315ml following neoadjuvant chemotherapy. 55 children underwent surgery and 52 completed treatment. 2 children had tumour spill and one had recurrence at biopsy site. After a mean follow up of 42 months, 43 are in CR1 and 4 in CR2. The OS was 80% and EFS was 73%. Comparing this data with the historical cohort: OS 80 vs 55%, stage I 100 vs 81%, II90 vs 75%, III 80 vs 42% IV 53 vs 14%, V 67 vs 50%. OS for localized disease 97 vs 80% and metastatic disease 50 vs 18%. Conclusions: There is significant improvement in OS of all stages of Wilms tumour treated on SIOPWT2001 protocol compared to historic cohort treated with upfront surgery followed by chemotherapy. In centres where patients present with large tumours, use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery is preferable. The outcome of the cohort treated on SIOPWT2001 protocol for localised disease is comparable with data from developed countries, however it is less for metastatic disease. P-177 Bilateral Wilms Tumor, Demographic Characteristics, Treatment and Outcome: A Multicenter Study R. Kebudi 1, D. Tugcu2, Darendeliler9 Oncology Institute, Pediatric HematologyOncology, Istanbul, Turkey; 2Istanbul University Istanbul Medical Faculty, Pediatric HematologyOncology, Istanbul, Turkey; 3Kanuni Sultan Suleyman Education and Research Hospital, Pediatric HematologyOncology, Istanbul, Turkey; 4Istanbul Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty, Pediatric HematologyOncology, Turkey; Education Research Hospital, Pediatric Oncology, Istanbul, Turkey; 6Marmara University Pendik Education and Research Hospital, HematologyOncology, 7Istanbul University Oncology Institute, Radiation Oncology, Istanbul, Turkey; 10Istanbul University Istanbul Medical Faculty, Pediatric Surgery, Istanbul, Turkey; 11Istanbul University Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty, Pediatric Surgery, Istanbul, University Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty, Radiology, Istanbul, Turkey; 13Istanbul University Istanbul Medical Faculty, Pathology, Istanbul, Turkey Background/Objectives: Bilateral Wilms tumor (BWT) comprise 5% of all Wilms tumor in children. The outcomes of children with BWT are reported to be inferior than for children with unilateral tumors at diagnosis. Design/Methods: In this multicentric study, patients with BWT treated in seven centers in Istanbul were retrospectively evaluated for demographic characteristics, treatment and outcome. Results: Thirty one patients (19 female, 12 male) with a median age of 22.5 months (463) treated between 19902017 were evaluated. Nine patients had various congenital conditions. Eight patients (26%) had metastasis (lung, liver) at diagnosis. Eighteen patients had a biopsy (58%), 8 patients unilateral nephrectomy (26%) at diagnosis. Five (16%) patients were diagnosed as BWT only radiologically. Anaplasia was found in 4 patients. All received chemotherapy (vincristine, actinomycine D\u00b1adriamycine (VAD) initially). Radiologic response to VAD given the same day was better. Twenty five patients underwent surgery (8 unilateral nephrectomy; 8 unilateral nephrectomy+partial contralateral nephrectomy; 4 unilateral nephrectomy+contralateral tumor 2 nephrectomy; 1 unilateral partial nephrectomy+ contralateral tumor excision; 1 bilateral tumor excision; 1 unilateral tumor excision). Fifteen patients (48%) received radiotherapy. Three patients (9.6%) who never had surgery are alive with no disease (1436 months from diagnosis). Two patients (6.5%) developed chronic renal failure. Four patients died due to progressive disease. Overall survival was 79% and event free survival 73%, at a median follow up of 57 months (3322). Survival was significantly lower in metastatic patients (95 vs 48%) (p=0.04) and in those with anaplasia in histopathology (95 vs 0%) (p=0.001). Conclusions: Treatment of BWT is a challenge and the goal is to have a good survival and to spare normal renal parenchyma from unnecessary surgical resection, when possible. In this series, the survival in nonmetastatic patients with favorable histology is quite high with most of the surviving patients having adequate renal function. P-178 Outcomes of Nephroblastoma (Wilms Tumor) Treatment in Western Ukraine, A 10 Year Report from a Retrospective Cohort Analysis R. Kizyma 1, Z. Kizyma1, I. Lukavetskyi1, B. Romanyshyn1, Ukrainian Specialized Children's Medical Centre, Intensive Care Department, Lviv, Ukraine Background/Objectives: The objectives of the analyses study were to review the clinical presentation and management of children with Wilms tumor and the factors influencing the outcome in Lviv region. Despite the good overall prognosis in patients with nephroblastoma, most children in the developing country present with advanced stage of disease at diagnosis. Design/Methods: A retrospective chart review of 46 children with renal tumours mostly from western part of Ukraine treated and observed at surgery department of our institution from 2005 to 2015 was performed. Diagnosis was confirmed by conventional CT, MRI and sonography, that were performed according to the site of involvement. The treatment protocol was based on SIOP recommendations. Results: More than a half of patients presented with large primary tumour or metastatic spread of disease: 17 cases (37%) were diagnosed as stage III, 10 cases (21.7%) as stage IV. Stage I was diagnosed in 5 patients (10.9%) and stage II in 10 children (21.7%). Four cases with bilateral disease (stage V) were observed with dominant tumour referring to stage III. The neoadjuvant vincristindactinomycin chemotherapy regimen was used as standart with no upfront surgeries (nephrectomy or biopsy) performed in majority of cases. Unfavourable histological type (including clear cell sarcoma) was revealed in 17.4%. Adjuvant high risk chemotherapy and use of radiotherapy was considered in 43.5% of children mostly due to massive tumour spread at diagnosis. The 3year overall survival (OS) and event free survival (EFS) rates were 87% and 83%, respectively. Primary tumour stage was the most statistically significant factor that influenced the overall survival. Conclusions: The approach of neoadjuvant chemotherapy of nephroblastoma is more feasible compared to upfront surgery in the realms of developing country, considering statistically larger amount of advanced stage tumours at presentation. P-179 Wilms Tumor: A Retrospective Study of a Single Institute T. Mehmood 1 1Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Radiation Oncology, Lahore, Pakistan Background/Objectives: To compare our results to SIOP 9 study. Design/Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 45 children with Wilms Tumor (WT) treated at Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre Lahore, Pakistan from January 2001 to December 2010. Kaplan Meier method with LogRank testing was employed for survival analysis. Results: The mean age was 3.5 years old, with a sex ratio 0.48. Eighty percent of the children presented a painless abdominal tumor as a first sign. The tumor was mainly unilateral (93%), right for 56% of them. Ultrasounds, computed tomography showed a heterogeneous tumor in 52%, with a medium size of 16.5 cm, developed in 48% in the lower pole of the kidney. Venous thrombosis was diagnosed in 6.5% of the patients. 23% of the patients had metastatic disease at presentation. Most of the patients received preoperative chemotherapy (98.3%) followed by nephrectomy. Postoperative stage I, II, III were respectively 39%, 41%, 20% and according to SIOP 9 risk classification, there were 28%, 62%, 10% of low, intermediate and high histological risk. Postoperative chemotherapy was received in 84% while adjuvant radiotherapy was given to 16% of the patients. The fiveyear overall survival was 68%, 80% in localized stages and 46% in metastatic stages. Thirtyfour percent relapsed in an average of 9 months. No late treatment related side effects were seen. Conclusions: This study shows less overall survival then the SIOP 9, due to a bigger rate of metastatic forms and late diagnosis. P-180 Renal Tumors in Children: A 25Year Single Center Experience M. Moschovi 1, A. A. Athanasiadou1, I. Nikas2, K. Stefanaki3, G. Chrousos1 1University of Athens Medical School, 1st Pediatric Dept Hematology/Oncology Unit, Athens, Greece; 2University of Athens Medical School, Imaging Department \"AGIA SOPHIA\" Children's Hospital, Athens, Greece; 3University of Athens Medical Department \"AGIA SOPHIA\" Children's Hospital, Athens, Greece Background/Objectives: Nephroblastoma, or Wilms' tumor, is the most common renal malignancy in childhood. The median age at diagnosis is approximately 3.5 years. The occurrence in infancy and adolescence is quite rare. Other less frequent tumors include mesoblastic nephroma, clear cell sarcoma, rhabdoid tumor and adenocarcinoma. Design/Methods: We reviewed all children with renal tumors treated in our center in the last 25 years and evaluated demographic features, histopathologic results and outcome. Results: Out of a total of 91 cases with renal tumor, there were 85 cases of nephroblastoma (34M, 51F), three cases of mesoblastic nephroma, one of clear cell sarcoma, one of rhabdoid tumor, and one of anaplastic sarcoma. Specifically regarding nephroblastoma, the age at diagnosis ranged from 4mo14yrs (mean: 4.2yrs): 2 children (2,5%) were <6mo, were 6mo-3yrs, 41 children (48%) were 310yrs and 7 children (8,5%) were >10yrs old. In three cases, nephroblastoma developed in the context of a genetic syndrome, specifically two cases of DenysDrash syndrome and one of WAGR syndrome. 35 patients resided in large urban centers and 48 resided in the province. Relapse was observed in two cases, 12 (M) and 17 (F) years after the initial diagnosis, respectively, with the relapse in the second case occurring two years after pregnancy. Now, both cases are in second remission. One case with DenysDrash syndrome remains in remission ten years after diagnosis. Three cases died: two with nephroblastomaone from the disease and the other with DenysDrash syndrome from renal failure and one with rhabdoid tumor. Conclusions: Nephroblastoma is nowadays a curable disease. We observed a higher mean age at diagnosis than those recorded in international data. This may denote a delay in diagnosis and thus a need for a higher level of awareness. Since relapse can occur decades after the initial diagnosis, a longterm followup is required. P-181 Single and Tandem HighDose Chemotherapy Followed by Autologous Stem Cell Rescue in Wilms Tumors: A SingleInstitution Report on Feasibility and Toxicity Profile M. Delafoy 1, C. Pasqualini1, C. Dufour1, Therapy Unit, Villejuif, France Background/Objectives: Very few data have been reported yet on highdose chemotherapy (HDC) with autologous stem cell rescue (ASCR) in Wilms tumors (WT). We aim to define the feasibility and the safety profile of HDC with ASCR in a pediatric cohort of WT. Design/Methods: We analysed data from patients with WT treated with HDC and ASCR from 2000 to 2016 in the Children and Adolescent Oncology Unit at Gustave Roussy. Toxicity is reported according to CTCAE v4.0. Results: Ten patients received HDC Carboplatine (MEC), HDC followed n=4; Thiotepa 900 mg/m\u00b2, at ASCR was 5.6 years (2.621.2). HDC was performed at relapse for 9 patients and as firstline in 1 patient with stage 4 highrisk WT. Most observed toxicity was digestive with grade 3 mucositis and diarrhoea in 6 and 3 patients, respectively. One grade 3 renal toxicity was displayed after MEC. No neurological toxicity was observed nor sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. The median duration of neutrophil recovery and hospitalisation was 10 (213) and 24 days (2136), respectively. No toxicityrelated death was observed. Toxicity profile was similar in single and tandem HDC. Whenever needed, the treatment could be completed by lung and/or liver radiotherapy, with no significant delay. At the last followup, 4 patients were alive in complete remission (CR1 n=1; CR2 n=3), while 6 patients died of progressive disease. Conclusions: Single and tandem HDC seems to be feasible and with an acceptable toxicity profile in WT. Prospective national and international studies are needed to define the best condition regimens and to evaluate the role of HDC in this setting. P-182 Consolidation Therapy with Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant in Patients with Relapsed Wilms Tumour. Experience of A Single Mexican Pediatric Hospital A. Castellanos1, H. Pena 1 1Instituto Nacional de Pediatr\u00eda, Oncology, Mexico City, Mexico Background/Objectives: To determine the experience of a therapeutic arm with autologous hematopoietic stem cell rescue in wilms tumour's patients at National Institute of Pediatrics (INP) in Mexico City Design/Methods: We performed a retrospective study with the analysis of 10 years of experience at INP of patients with Wilms Tumour. We only analized patients with relapse Results: A total of 9 relapses (8%) were diagnosed, including 5 patients (55%) with wilms tumour relapse who received treatment with intense chemotherapy, radiation therapy and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The mean age at diagnosis was 38 months with a mean relapse time from diagnosis of 18 months. Favorable histology was reported in 2 patients, and all the cases were metastatic at diagnosis, all cases with lung metastasis and one patient also liver. All patients received intense chemotherapy with ifosfamide 1.8grm2scdose / 5 days, etoposide 100mgm2scdose / 5 days and carboplatin 450mgm2scdose / 1 day (ICE) as well as abdominal/pulmonary radiation therapy for the treatment of relapse.The 5year overall survival is 57% (95% CI 2.469.00). The cause of death was progression of disease in both cases. No transplantrelated mortality was reported Conclusions: Treatment of relapse in wilms tumor with combination therapy (radiation, chemotherapy and stem cell transplant) is effective. Morbimortality related to intensive treatment was no reported in our cases P-183 Association Between Long Interspersed Nuclear Element1 Methylation Levels and Relapse in Blastemal Component of Wilms Pereira MontalvaodeAzevedo1, Faria2, P. Nicolau Neto3, B. de Camargo1, S. 1Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Pediatric Hematology Oncology Programa, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; 2Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Patholgy Division, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; 3Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Carcinogenesis molecular Program, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; 4Brazilian Biosciences National Laboratory LNBio, Brazilian Center for Research in Energy and Materials CNPEM, Campinas, Brazil Background/Objectives: Risk stratification of Wilms tumors (WTs) is largely based on tumor stage and histology, with the blastemal component predominance in chemotherapy pretreated WT classifying patiets as high risk. WTs present an hypomethylation profile compared to matched normal kidney. We aimed to explore the relation between global DNA methylation, represented by LINE1 (17% of the human genome) in WT blastemal component and prognostic factors Design/Methods: Samples from 47 FFPE sporadic unilateral WTs from patients treated according to the SIOP WT 2001 protocol at INCA (Brazil) were reviewed by pathologist who defined areas of blastema and normal renal cortex tissues. Prognostic factors (age, gender and risk classificaion) and relapse were explored regarding LINE1 methylation as defined by pyrosequencing. Average methylation of 5 CpG sites located in LINE1 were used for analyzes. Results: Comparing WT blastemal (median of 65%, 47.473.2%) to normal kidney (median of 71.8%, 51.577.5%) samples revealed that LINE1 is hypomethylated in WT (p<0.0001). Age, gender, stage and risk classification showed no relation with methylation levels within WT samples. Nevertheless, tumors from patients who relapsed (60.5%, 47.471.30%) presented lower methylation levens than those patients without relapse (66.5%, 52.873.30%, p=0.0005). A ROC curve analysis using a cutoff value of 62.71% for LINE1 methylation levels showed that the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.80, with a sensitivity of 76.5% and a specificity of 83.3% (p=0.0005). Conclusions: We suggest that LINE1 methylation levels evaluated in the blastemal component of WT can be used as a marker for patients, with WT that presented relapse reporting hypomethylation compared to patients without relapse P-184 Challenges and Implications of Histopathology Diagnosis of 'NonWilm's' Tumours of Kidney in Children M. Ramadwar 1, A. Sali1, B. Rekhi1, S. Vora3, Hospital, 2TATA Memorial Hospital, Paediatric Surgery, Mumbai, India; 3TATA Memorial Medical Oncology, 4TATA radiation oncology, Radiolgy, Mumbai, India Background/Objectives: 'NonWilm's' tumour category constitutes several rare benign and highly aggressive tumours of kidney in children. We aim to review histopathology of 'nonWilm's' tumours with emphasis on diagnostic challenges and clinical relevance of the precise diagnosis. Design/Methods: We reviewed histopathology and immunohistochemistry (IHC) of 55 patients diagnosed with 'nonWilm's' renal tumours from period 2011 2016. Clinical details were noted from electronic medical records. Results: Various nonWilm's renal tumours in our series of 55 patients were rhabdoid tumour (20), clear of INI1 on IHC. Remaining 8 tumours posed diagnostic problems. Distinction between clear cell sarcoma and Wlim's tumour could not be resolved (2). Undifferentiated round cell tumours posed a problem of differentiation between Wilm's synovial sarcoma respectively (5), Teratoid Wilm's and teratoma could not be distinguished. 11 of 20 patients with rhabdoid tumour underwent resection postchemotherapy. 3 patients presented with extensive brain and lung metastasis. Rest were inoperable tumours. 7 of 11 patients with clear cell sarcoma could undergo resection. Relapses were in the form of bone and brain metastasis. Conclusions: Rhabdoid tumour and clear were tumours. Tumours with undifferentiated round cell morphology posed diagnostic problem. Clear cell sarcoma also posed a diagnostic problem due to its nondiscrete morphology and lack of specific immunoprofile. Diagnosis of rhabdoid tumours was facilitated by its distinctive morphology and loss of INI1 expression on IHC. Thus our study emphasises the need of precise diagnosis on biopsy due to its impact on treatment decisions of wide variety of different tumour entities. P-185 Tumor Inferior VENA CAVA oncology, Moscow, Russia Background/Objectives: Nephroblastoma is one of the most common solid tumors in childhood (about 7%). The incidence of tumor thrombosis in nephroblastoma according to various large studies is 3 to 6%. In the literature there are rare individual descriptions of cases of thrombosis of children with nephroblastoma with the spread of thrombus to the atrium. Design/Methods: In our clinic from 1990 to 2016 were treated 24 children with nephroblastoma, with IVC thrombosis. Age of children ranged from 1 year to 15 years. In 2 of these, the thrombus reached the right atrium. Treatment included preoperative chemotherapy, surgery (nephrectomy, thrombectomy) and postoperative radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Results: Survival in stage III nephroblastoma does not differ from survival in nephroblastoma with tumor IVC thrombosis. With preoperative chemotherapy, complete regression of the tumor thrombus can be achieved in 57.9% of cases, partial regression in 21.1%. Preoperative chemotherapy reduces intraoperative blood loss and the frequency of surgical complications. Under the condition of radical operation, the localization of lesions of different sections of the IVC does not affect survival. Currently, 22 children were alive without evidence of recurrence and disease progression. Conclusions: Complex therapy allows to achieve a good overall survival of children with nephroblastoma with IVC thrombosis. P-186 The Outcome of Ruptured Wilms Tumor: Single Institution Experience T. sarrawi 1, T. ISMAEEL1, R. DEEBAJAH1, K. ghandoUr1, F. AJLOUNI1, I. SULTAN1 1King Hussein Cancer Center, Pediatric, Amman, Jordan Background/Objectives: Patients with Wilms tumor (WT) can present with ruptured tumors with no specific symptoms. Radiologic diagnosis, pathological confirmation and optimal management are necessary to improve the outcome of these patients. Design/Methods: We conducted a retrospective chartreview of all pediatric patients who were diagnosed with WT between 20032016. Ruptured Wilms Tumor was diagnosed based on radiological and/or pathological findings Results: Twenty seven patients (Males, 52%) were analysed. Median age at diagnosis was 4.5 years (range, 1.615.8). Pathological local stages, irrespective of rupture, were as (n=3, 11%), II (n=7, 26%), III (n=17, 63%). The median duration of symptoms before presentation was 2 weeks (range, 017). Twenty three (85%) patients had favorable histology. Distant metastasis was found in 8(29.6%) patients at presentation. Upfront nephrectomy was done for 9(33.3%) of patients. Ruptured WT was identified radiologically in 21(78%) patients and intraoperatively in 6 patients (22%). Rupture was pathologically confirmed in 13 patients (48%). Twenty five (93%) patients received postoperative radiotherapy, whether flank or whole abdomen. Relapse developed in 8(30%) patients, and 6 of them died. One of the relapsed patients was not upstaged and 2 of them did not receive radiotherapy. The 3year OS and EFS were 69\u00b111% and 66\u00b19.9%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed relatively worse EFS for patients with age less than 4 years (p=0.059). In further analysis, no difference in outcome was observed according to duration of symptoms, use of radiotherapy or upfront nephrectomy. Conclusions: Similar to previous reports, we showed that majority of patients with rupture can be cured with a 3drug regimen and abdominal radiation. Clinicoradiologicalpathological correlation is important to diagnose these patients. The current staging system is not optimal to capture these patients and needs to be revised. P-187 Presentation and Outcomes of Wilms Tumour in a Paediatric Unit in Ghana L.G. Tagoe 1, E. Nyarko1 Teaching Hospital, Child Accra, Ghana Background/Objectives: Wilms tumour is the fourth commonest childhood malignancy in Ghana. The survival of Wilms tumour in subSaharan Africa is reported to be below 50%. The objective of this study is to describe the presentation of Wilms tumour, extent of spread at presentation and patient outcomes. Design/Methods: In this retrospective study, clinical notes, including results of investigations of children diagnosed with Wilms tumour at the Paediatric Oncology Unit of the Korlebu Teaching Hospital, Accra, from January 2011 to December 2015 were reviewed. Data was then analysed for time lag between symptom onset, presentation and start of treatment, evidence of metastases, histopathological features and patient outcomes. Results: Fiftyone case notes (54%) were retrieved out of the ninetyfour cases seen over the period. Majority of the patients (37%) were between three to five years old with a male: female ratio 1:1.7. Five (10%) had bilateral disease. The commonest presenting complaint was a painless abdominal mass (47%). Most patients delayed in seeking medical help with 53% presenting after a month. In majority (98%) of the patients, maximum tumour diameter was >8cm by imaging. 11 cases (22%) had metastases at presentation, to the lungs and/or liver. 96% of patients received treatment, which in all cases, except two, involved neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to nephrectomy. 35% of cases were found to be Stage III at surgery. 57% were classified as intermediate risk at histopathology and 20% high risk. 33% received adjuvant radiotherapy. 9 patients (18%) abandoned treatment, whilst 55% completed treatment and are currently alive. 8 patients (16%) relapsed after treatment completion. 7 patients (14%) died either before, during treatment or after relapse. Conclusions: Although most children with Wilms tumour in our setting present with advanced stage disease (stages III to V), with the appropriate treatment including radiotherapy, the outcomes are encouraging. P-188 Intussusception After Renal Tumor Surgery in Children: Two Cases and an Overview of Literature S. van Peer 1, C. van de Ven1, S. Terwisscha van Scheltinga1, J. Hol1, M. van Grotel1, van HeuvelEibrink1 1Princess M\u00e1xima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands Background/Objectives: To further optimize survival rates as well as quality of cure for pediatric kidney tumors, attention for treatment related morbidity and mortality has become increasingly important. Intussusception is a rare but important complication after tumornephrectomy in children, causing morbidity, mortality and prolonged hospitalization. In this study, we describe two recent cases in our institute and provide a comprehensive review of the literature. Design/Methods: For our narrative review, we searched for all reported cases of post tumornephrectomy intussusception published until November 2016, using Pubmed and Embase libraries. Results: A total of 52 pediatric renal tumor cases who developed intussusception after tumornephrectomy were identified. Median age was 23 months (range 584). Median time of onset was postoperative day 6 (range 337). Of 41 patients described in detail, 37 suffered from a ileoileal intussusception, 4/41 were ileocolic. Most frequent presenting symptom was bilious vomiting. Preceding treatment approach could was documented in 45 cases; i.e. preoperative chemotherapy was administered to 10/45 patients. In 29 of 30 well documented cases successful manually reduction through relaparotomy was described and only 1 patient needed resection. All patients survived without recurrence of intussusception. Conclusions: In pediatric renal tumor patients small bowel obstruction seems to reflect most postnephrectomy intussusception cases in contrast to the ileocolic idiopathic intussusceptions that are observed in healthy children. Symptoms of intussusception mimic chemotherapy related toxicity and general postsurgical symptoms, thereby initiating a significant delay in diagnosis. Awareness of intussusception after renal tumor surgery is warranted. P-189 Evaluation of Preoperative Tace in Children with Advanced Wilm's Tumor C. Lai 1, J. Wang2, Q. Shu2, M. Li2 1Children's Hospital Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Department of Radiology, Hangzhou, China; 2Children's Hospital Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Department of Surgical Oncology, Hangzhou, China Background/Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of preoperative TACE in children with advanced Wilm's tumor. Design/Methods: In the late 62 cases of advanced Wilms tumor, inclusion criteria: tumor diameter> 10cm or medial border over midline; imaging studies suggest tumor invasion of adjacent organs, have abdominal aortic lymph node metastasis or ascites; inferior vena cava tumor thrombosis; the lung, liver, bone and other metastases; bilateral Wilms tumor. Study groups: Preoperative arterial chemoembolization group (31 cases), Preoperative intravenous chemotherapy group (20 cases), Early surgery group (11 cases). Results: Preoperative TACE group average reduction of 32.4% of tumor, preoperative chemotherapy tumor shrinkage of 20.3%, the tumor volume reduction rate between the two groups was statistically significant.Three groups of patients with complete resection rate was 87.1%, 70.0% and 18.2%, preoperative TACE group with preoperative the difference was statistically significant. Conclusions: Preoperative TACE has higher tumor shrinkage rate, shorter peroperatin treatment time, less systemic toxicity, higher rate of complete tumor resection. TACE is safe and effective in advanced Wilm's tumor. P-190 Evaluation of Preoperative Transarterial Chemoembolization in Wilms' Z. D. H. Jin1, X. Guo1, X. Fang1, J. Wang2 1Jinhua central hospital, Department of pediatric surgery, Jinhua, China; 2Children's Hospital Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Department of Surgical Oncology, Hangzhou, China Background/Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) combining with surgery in the treatment of Wilms' tumor in children. Design/Methods: Twentyfour cases of wilms' tumor were admitted to the department of pediatric surgery in Jinhua municipal central hospital between January 2010 and December 2016. Three cases of bilateral tumor and 1 case of solitary tumor were excluded, 20 cases of unilateral wilms' tumor were randomly allocated to preoperative TACE group ( preoperative TACE + surgery, n = 10) and control group (preoperative chemotherapy + surgery, n = 10). The shrinkage volume of tumor between pre and postchemotherapy, blood loss during surgery, intraoperative tumor spillage, operative time and postoperative complications were analyzed. Results: Comparing with control group, the shrinkage volume of tumor is higher in the preoperative TACE group (476.9\u00b1156.75cm3 vs. 577.5\u00b1138.35cm3, P<0.05), blood was less (97.5\u00b121.63ml vs. 119\u00b126.23ml, P<0.05), myelosuppression rate was lower (0 vs. 5, P<0.05). The number of Less intraoperative tumor spillage in TACE group, but there was statistical diffence between two groups. The mean followup time was 34.15 months, no tumor recurrence or distant metastasis was observed. Conclusions: Preoperative TACE combining with surgery is a safe and effective modality in the treatment of wilms' tumor in children. P-191 Clinical Characteristics of Renal Cell Carcinoma Associated with XP11.2 Translocation/TFE Gene Fusion in Children: An Experience of A Single Institution W. Yao 1, K. Li1, K. Dong1, X. Xiao1, S. Zheng1 1Children's Hospital of Fudan University, Pediatric Surgery, Shanghai, China Background/Objectives: To investigate the clinical features, prognosis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) associated with Xp11.2 translocation/TFE gene fusion in children. Design/Methods: A retrospective review of 10 cases between Jan 2010 and Dec 2016 were evaluated and the clinical data were collected and analyzed. Results: Xp 11.2 translocation RCCs were identified in 7 males and 3 females with a mean age of 5.2 years (range: 1.212.9 years). The clinical symptom included painless hematuria in 3 cases, abdominal pain with microscopic hematuria in 3 cases and as an incidental finding in 4 patients. According to the TNM staging system, there were 3 patients in stage I, 2 patients in stage II, 4 patients in stage III and 1 patients in stage IV with lumber metastasis. The tumor side is between 5.11 745.05 cm3 (mean 197.17cm3). Radical nephrectomy and lymphadenectomy were performed in 8 patients and lymphatic invasion was confirmed in 4 cases, while tumor biopsy was performed in 2 patients. Only one patient received postoperative chemotherapy, while 7 patients just observed after surgery and of the 2 patients with biopsy, one received radiotherapy and the other one gave up treatment. All patients were followed up for an average of 24.2 months (range: 2 74 months), and 7 were still alive and 3 had died after surgery. Conclusions: Xp 11.2 translocation RCC is rare subtype of renal tumor in children associated with poor prognosis and lymphatic metastasis. Radical nephrectomy and lymphadenectomy is the main treatment for these patients. Solid Non Brain Tumours Bone Tumours P-192 In Vivo Prevention Local Effect of Cadmium of Local Recurrence in Xenograft Model of Osteosarcoma D. Demirkiran1, S. Aktas 1, Orthopedics, Izmir, Turkey Background/Objectives: Osteosarcoma usually occurs in childhood and young adulthood and is very aggressive. These tumors were achieved great success in limb salvage surgery. However, residual tumor may remain at the microscopic level increases the likelihood of recurrence. Apart from surgery, the residual tumor is observed despite the highdose methotrexate, cisplatin chemotherapy regimens, therefore, new approaches are needed for the treatment of osteosarcoma. In this study, the cadmium in cement was placed locally after surgical resection to evaluate its preventive efficacy on residual tumor and recurrence in in vivo animal model. Design/Methods: K7M2 tumorigenic osteosarcoma cell line was cultivated in vitro. Then, the xenograft tumor model was formed by giving the tumor cells subcucateously to athymic nude mice. After the tumor growth, control tumor, near total resected tumor group, near total resected group with serum in cement and near total resected group with cadmium in cement group was conducted randomly with 7 animals in each group. Animals were observed for 15 days for recurrences in tumor site. After the sacrification, the presence of residue was checked histopathologically in each group. Results: Tumor was formed within one month after subcutanous injection. REcurrent tumor was formed in all animals in near total resected group, near total resected group with serum in cement. No or small tumor formation was observed in cadmium group. No systemic toxic effect was observed. Conclusions: Our data suggest that local application of cadmium in cement might help local therapy of osteosarcoma after surgery. Postoperative local treatment with agents within orthopedic biyomechanic substances might be an option of additive treatment to overcome the recurrences in osteosarcoma. Our next step is to test chemotherapoetic agents (methotrexate, cispatin) in cemnent in of an Unresectable Sacral Giant Cell Tumour of Bone with Denosumab after a PregnancyInduced Hiatus S. Wilson1, S. Pratap2, E. Blanco 1, 1Oxford Haematology/Oncology, Oxford, Kingdom; 2Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford Sarcoma Service, Oxford, United Kingdom; 3University of Oxford, Oxford Sarcoma Service, Oxford, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: Giant cell tumours of bone (GCTB) are benign, locally aggressive tumours predominantly treated surgically. More recently, neoadjuvant treatment with the RANKL monoclonal antibody Denosumab has enabled surgery in unresectable cases to be considered. Denosumab disturbs the RANKRANKL interaction, inhibiting osteoclasticinduced bone overexpressed on stromal cells driving bony destruction associated with the tumour. Oxford Sarcoma Service selectively utilises Denosumab to optimise operability and reduce surgical - associated morbidity. Design/Methods: We present the case of a patient undergoing Denosumab treatment for an unresectable sacral GCTB who became pregnant on treatment. Results: The patient presented with cauda equina syndrome. Biopsy of extensive S2S5 vertebral lesion sacral GCTB. Resection would require sacrifice of S23 nerve roots and the loss of bowel and bladder function. Denosumab was commenced with an excellent metabolic, radiological and neurological response after 1 cycle. PET/CT demonstrated a reduction in SUVmax from 16.3 to 4.4, with resolution of the presacral soft tissue mass and sacral ossification. Complete metabolic response was seen after 6 cycles of Denosumab. After 17 cycles, treatment was stopped because of pregnancy. During this time the patient's symptoms were stable despite the tumour increasing by greater than 15mm in the sagittal axis. A normal baby was born by elective Cesarean section, without skeletal or metabolic abnormalities. Denosumab was recommenced with a rapid radiological response after 1 cycle, peaking at cycle 13 when dose frequency was reduced to 6weekly. Alterations in bone mineralisation density has necessitated planning definitive local therapy with proton beam therapy. Conclusions: Denosumab provides excellent tumour control for unresectable GCTB. We report objective evidence that retreatment is effective after an hiatus and the risk of resistance is low. Consideration of longterm toxicity and definitive management remain important considerations. P-194 A DNA MethylationBased Classifier for Accurate Molecular Diagnosis of Bone Sarcomas P. Wu1, B. Cooper1, F. Bu2, Oncology, New York, 2NYU Medical Center, Pathology, New York, USA; 3Memorial Kettering Cancer Center, Pathology, New York, USA; 4NYU Langone Medical Center, Pediatrics, New York, USA; 5Montefiore Medical Center, Pediatrics, New York, USA; 6Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Pediatrics, New York, USA Background/Objectives: Pediatric bone sarcomas present a unique diagnostic challenge because of the considerable morphologic overlap between different entities. The choice of optimal treatment, however, is dependent upon accurate diagnosis. Genomewide DNA methylation profiling has emerged as a powerful new diagnostic tool in brain tumors, with diagnostic accuracy exceeding standard histopathology. We developed and validated a methylation based classifier to differentiate between osteosarcoma (OS), sarcoma (SS). Design/Methods: DNA methylation status of 482,421 CpG sites in 15 OS, 10 ES, and 11 SS samples were measured using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 array. From this training set of 36 sarcoma samples we developed a random forest classifier from the 400 most differentially methylated CpG sites (FDR q value < 0.001). This classifier was then validated in 10 SS samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), 86 OS samples from TARGETOS, and 15 ES samples from a recently published series (HuertasMartinez et al., Cancer Lett. 2016). Results: DNA methylation profiling revealed three distinct molecular clusters, each enriched with a single sarcoma subtype. Within the validation cohorts, all samples from TCGA were accurately classified as synovial sarcoma (10/10, sensitivity and specificity 100%). All but one sample from TARGETOS were classified as OS (85/86, sensitivity 98%, specificity 100%) and all but one sample from the ES series was classified as ES (14/15, sensitivity 93%, specificity 100%). The single mismatch, an osteosarcoma sample which was classified as a ES, was later determined to be a misdiagnosed ES based on RNAseq data demonstrating high EWRS1 and ETV1 expression. An additional clinical sample that was misdiagnosed as a SS based on initial histolopathology, was accurately recognized as OS by the methylation classifier. Conclusions: OS, ES and SS have distinct epigenetic profiles. Our validated methylationbased classifier provides increased diagnostic accuracy, including in cases where standard histopathology is inconclusive. P-195 Extrapulmonary Metastasis is an Important Prognostic Factor in Patients with Osteosarcoma Accompanied by Pulmonary Metastasis N. Kitagawa 1, M. Shinkai1, Mochizuki1, Y. Department of Surgery, Yokohama, Japan; 2Kanagawa Children's Medical Center, Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Yokohama, 3Kanagawa Children's Medical Center, Department regenerative medicine, Yokohama, Japan; of Radiology, Yokohama, Japan; 5Kanagawa Children's Medical Center, Department of Pathology, Yokohama, Japan Background/Objectives: Distant metastasis is one of the most important prognostic factors in osteosarcoma. Metastases usually occur in the lung. We have performed aggressive pulmonary metastasecomy, but prognosis of these patients are still unsatisfactory. The aim of this study is to find prognostic factors in patients with osteosarcoma accompanied by pulmonary metastasis. Design/Methods: Retrospective chart reviews of 50 patients with osteosarcoma were performed. All patients underwent neoadjuvant, adjuvant chemotherapy and surgery for the primary lesion. Each metastatic lung lesion was removed mainly by wedge resection through an open thoracotomy, sometimes lobectomy if tumor was too large. Results: Twentyeight patients had lung metastases. Thirteen out of these 28 patients had extrapulmonary metastasis(EPM). Metastatic sites were bones, soft tissue, the diaphragm and brain. The 5year survival rate was 96% in patients without metastasis, compared to 50% with pulmonary metastasis. In 28 patients with pulmonary metastasis, the 5year survival rate of patients without EPM was 76%, 15% in patients with EPM. In patients without EPM, 90% of 5year survival rate was achieved by surgical metastasectomy compared to 60% without metastasectomy. In patients with EPM, the 5years survival rate achieved by surgical metastasectomy was 25% compared to 0% without. Conclusions: Our results suggested that pulmonary metastasis was the most important prognostic factor in patients with osteosarcoma, and EPM was also a contributing factor. In patients without EPM, pulmonary metastasectomy is recommended. However, in patients with EPM, the prognosis was still poor even when metastasectomy was performed. Some form of new strategy is needed. P-196 Mechanical Damage of Knee Endoprosthesis in Children with Malignant Bone Tumors V. Kobys 1, V. Konovalenko2 1Kiev City Oncology Center, Pediatric Ukraine; Experimental Oncology, Department of Osteology, Kiev, Ukraine Background/Objectives: Due to the growth of the child and the increase of body mass, the mechanical load on the endoprothesis significantly increases, and extension of the prosthesis increases the arm of force on the endoprosthesis stem. Over time this leads to fracture of the femoral endoprosthesis stem and the need for reoperation to replace the endoprosthesis. Design/Methods: During the period from 2000 to 2016, we operated 50 patients with malignant femur bone tumors aged 7 to 18 years, the average age was 11.5 years. 16 (31%) of them had a fracture of the femoral bone endoprosthesis stem in the period from 3 to 10 years after the arthroplasty. The material was titanium endoprosthesis or kobalchromiummolybdenum alloy. Rod diameter femoral stem was 10 to 12 mm. Results: All patients with a fracture of the femoral endoprosthesis stem had reimplantation of the stem, mostly with a stem of a larger diameter. There was no deterioration of limb function. In cement endoprosthesis the stems were removed without cutting the bone containing the fragments of the stem. In the cementfree prosthesis, longitudinal osteotomy was performed to extract fragments of the endoprothesis stem. Conclusions: When implanting knee endoprotheses in children, preference should be given to cement endoprosthesis because of the high risk of fracture endoprosthesis legs. They are much less traumatically removed when replacing endoprosthesis stems. Later, when the patient stops growing, cementfree endoprosthesis can be implanted. P-197 Serum Adhesion Molecules Levels in Bone and Soft Tissue Sarcoma and Prognostic Significance N. Kurucu M. Yldrm3, . Ankara, Turkey; 2A.Y Ankara Oncology Ankara, Turkey; 3A.Y Ankara Oncology Research and Traning Hospital, Department of Pediatric Oncology, Ankara, Turkey Background/Objectives: Adhesion molecules are involved in carcinogenesis and metastases. The aim of this study is to analysis the serum levels of some adhesion molecules and their relationship with clinical, laboratory and prognostic factors. Design/Methods: Fortyfour patients diagnosed with bone and soft tissue sarcomas and 31 healthy controls were included in the study. Serum CD44, ICAM1, VCAM1, selectin and cadherin levels were analyzed with ELISA method at diagnosis, after induction and at the end of treatment. The mean AM levels of patients at different time were compared with each other and those of control groups. The relationship between serum AM levels and presence of metastases, percentage of necrosis and course of disease were evaluated. Results: There were 19 males, 21 females with a median age of 13 (121) years. The diagnoses were osteosarcoma in 21, Ewing sarcoma in 15, rhabdomyosarcoma in six, synovial sarcoma in two. Tumor location was long bones in 70% of patients. Twenty patients (45.5%) had metastatic disease at diagnosis. The mean CD44, selectin and cadherin levels of patients at diagnosis were significantly (p<0.001) higher than those of control group. Patients' CD44 and selectin levels were higher compared to controls in each diagnostic group. In osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma, significant decrease inCD44 and cadherin levels were observed at the end of treatment as compared to levels at diagnosis. The CD44 levels of patients with pulmonary metastasis had higher levels of CD44 than nonmetastatic patients (p:0.020). VCAM1 levels were significantly higher in relapsed disease (p:0.017). There was no relationship between adhesion molecules levels and mean percentage of necrosis. Conclusions: CD44, selectin levels were observed in bone and soft tissue sarcoma and they may be used as markers for diagnosis and followup. Our findings suggest that elevated levels of CD44 and VCAM1 were associated with metastatic and relapsed disease, respectively. P-198 An Economical Analysis for the Care of Pediatric Osteosarcoma Patients T. Kutluk 1, C. Aky\u00fcz1, A. Varan1, B. Yal\u00e7n1, N. Kurucu1, B. Aydn1 1Hacettepe University Cancer Institute & Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatric Oncology, Ankara, Turkey Background/Objectives: Survival rates in childhood cancer improved significantly during the last several decades. For further improvement at global level, economical analysis are critically important. The cost of diagnosis, treatment and followup of patients with osteosarcoma was investigated on this study. Design/Methods: Thirtytwo pediatric osteosarcoma cases sequentially diagnosed in 20092014 were included. The direct costs of ambulatory and inpatient care starting from diagnosis to December 2016 for each patient were analyzed in detail including examination, imaging, laboratory, operation, pathology, medicines, medical supplies, hospital accommodation and other service costs both for inpatient and outpatient care. Results: Thirtytwo patients (with a mean, median, minimum, maximum age, M/F ratio was 13.01, 13.58, 6.17, 17.83 years, M/F=17/15 respectively) were included. 22 patients had local and 10 had metastatic diseases at diagnosis. Threeyear overall survival (OS) was 58% for 32 patients. Threeyear OS was 75% for 22 patients with local disease and 20% for 10 patients with metastatic diseases. Median followup time was 40 months. Total costs for 32 patients 1.257.549,74 USD including 1.176.401,53 USD for inpatient costs (%93.5) and 81.148,21 USD for outpatient costs (% 6.5) with an average cost of 39.298,43 USD per patient. The distribution of costs (as USD) to different groups were; operation 68.766,64 (%5.47), (%4.53). Conclusions: To better understand the cost of care in pediatric cancers for investment purposes, detailed economical analysis are needed. As an example, the cost of care for pediatric osteosarcoma patients were calculated in this study. The average cost per patient found in this study seems reasonable for a middleincome country. These kinds of analysis will help to plan the childhood cancer care for countries, which are planning to invest on the childhood cancer control. P-199 Mechanisms of Drug Resistance to LikeEURAMOS1 Chemotherapy in Childhood Osteosarcoma: Preliminary Results A. Levashov1, E. and Oncology Institution, Moscow, Russia; 2Experimental Diagnostic and Treatment of Tumor Institution FSBI \u00abN.N. Blokhin Russian Cancer Research Center\u00bb, Experimental Diagnostic and Treatment of Tumor Institution, Moscow, Russia Background/Objectives: The aim of this study was to estimate ERCC1, TOP2a, RFC1 and MGMT proteins expression in 27 biopsy specimens and 38 tumor tissue samples with poor response (grade I and II of tumor cells necrosis rate) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy after surgery of the primary site. Design/Methods: Proteins expression was assessed by specimen was defined as weak (+), moderate (++), strong (+++) colouring of the tumor nuclei and cytoplasm (for ERCC1 and MGMT) with number of positive (for ERCC1), 25% (for MGMT). TOP2a and RFC1 positive specimen was defined as moderate (++), strong (+++) colouring of the tumor nuclei and cytoplasm (for TOP2a), membrane (for RFC1) with number of positive tumor cells above 25%. All 38 patients were treated according to likeEURAMOS1 chemotherapy. Primary metastatic osteosarcoma was diagnosed in 15 out of 38 patients and localized disease in 23. Results: TOP2a positive samples were revealed in 70.4% of biopsy specimens, in 26% of postoperative specimens (6.7% for group with metastases, 39.1% group in and 28.9%, ERCC1 positive / TOP2a negative / RFC1 variant in 0% and 26.9%, TOP2a negative / RFC1 negative variant in 10% and 65.4% (p < 0.05). Conclusions: These data suggest that basic mechanisms of drug resistance were presented by decreased TOP2a and RFC1 expression and constant MGMT expression, increased number of ERCC1 positive / TOP2a negative variant, ERCC1 positive / TOP2a negative / RFC1 negative variant and TOP2a negative / RFC1 negative variant in postoperative specimens. P-200 Challenges in the Nursing Care for Children with Cancer: Report of Experience from Nigeria N. Mary 1 1National Hospital Abuja, nursing serivces, Abuja, Nigeria Background/Objectives: Cancer is one the major causes of death in children and adolescents, accounting for about 4% of deaths in children below 5years in Nigeria. The nursing care of these patients often does not receive adequate attention. This report highlights challenges in nursing care of these children in a low resource setting and is aimed at raising awareness to influence advocacy and action. Design/Methods: A retrospective review of 38 children treated for cancers in an inpatient children's ward over a oneyear period (November 2015 - November 2016). In the same period, a total of 992 children were admitted into the same ward. The nursing care of the patients has been reviewed Results: Children with cancers accounted for 3.8% of admissions on the ward. In addition to the nursing workload of these patients, several important challenges and limitations were encountered requiring attention and efforts of the nursing staff, including; financial burden on parents and their inability to cope with costs, psychological issues involving parents and patients (aggression, anxiety, depression, withdrawal) and difficulties with communicating disease course, treatment and complications of treatment. These challenges significantly increased the nursing burden of the patients, which were often not part of patient treatment plan. Conclusions: It's important to include these identified challenges in the counseling and treatment plan of children with cancers, particularly in low resource settings where the burden of nursing care is enormous. Development and implementation of a careful multidisciplinary care plan should help in addressing these challenges P-201 Retinoblastoma, Osteosarcoma and Unusual Sites of Tumor Recurrence: A Case Report K. O'Halloran 1, M.R. Wollman2 1Childrens Hospital of UPMC, Pediatrics Pittsburgh, Hospital of UPMC, Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Pittsburgh, USA Background/Objectives: Osteosarcoma following retinoblastoma is known to occur, however, patterns of osteosarcoma recurrence in this subset of patients are not well described. We report the case of a patient with a history of bilateral germline retinoblastoma and osteosarcoma with unusual sites of soft tissue osteosarcoma recurrence. Design/Methods: Case Report. Results: At 6 months of age the patient was diagnosed with bilateral germline retinoblastoma despite no family history. He underwent chemotherapy with vincristine, carboplatin and etoposide. Given disease progression, however, he underwent enucleation of the right eye. He remained in remission for 12 years at which time he developed knee pain found to be an osteosarcoma tumor. No metastatic disease was noted on chest CT. He underwent 29 weeks of doxorubicin, cisplatin and methotrexate as per AOST0331. Less than 1 year later pulmonary metastases were found and following metastasectomy he was started on dinutuximab (phase II trial). Two weeks following initiation of dinutuximab he presented with an antebcubital fossa mass found on biopsy to represent soft tissue recurrence of osteosarcoma. PET scan subsequently revealed T12 vertebral, left popliteal soft tissue and right lower lobe lung lesion. Genetic testing was positive for TP53 mutation and CSF1R. He was subsequently started on ifosfamide. Due to mixed response and poor prognosis, however, he is now undergoing palliative radiation therapy and oral sorafenib. Conclusions: This case suggests survivors of germline retinoblastoma who develop a second primary malignancy and subsequent relapse may have more unusual sites and patterns of recurrence. This case furthermore illustrates that underlying genetic mutations such as Rb gene mutations may impact response to therapies including chemotherapy. P-202 Dose Intensity of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in the Treatment of Paediatric Patients with Osteosarcoma at Hospital Infantil De Mexico M.A. Background/Objectives: Osteosarcoma is the most common bone malignancy, which is more frequent in children and adolescents. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy for osteosarcoma offers a series of advantages, such as treatment of microscopic metastases or shrinking the primary tumor with possibility of limbsparing surgery. Preoperative treatment allows in vivo evaluation of the treatment and postoperative treatment adjustment according to histological response. Design/Methods: We conducted a retrospective study based in medical records of all patients with osteosarcoma who had received neoadjuvant treatment at Hospital Infantil de M\u00e9xico Federico G\u00f3mez (HIMFG) between 20092014. The aim of this study was to evaluate the dose intensity (DI), which is calculated as dose per unit of time. For the purpose of this analysis, \"time\" was set as \"days\", starting at \"Day 1\" of chemotherapy according to 2 different treatments. The MAP treatment consisted of preoperative administration of two 5week cycles of cisplatin (120 mg/m2), doxorubicin (75mg/m2) and methotrexate(2x 12g/m2). The second consisted of four cycles of cisplatin(120mg/m2), and doxorubicin(75mg/m2) administrated every three weeks. The neoadjuvant DI was calculated for each drug administrated. Results: Thirtyfour medical records were collected during this period of time. However, eleven of them were eliminated since chemotherapy information was incomplete or treatmentrelated death prior to day and followup ended before day 7084. The information from the remaining 23 medical records was analyzed. The study population were 12 females and 22 males. Regarding the age at diagnosis, the median was 11.5 years(417y). Metastases at diagnosis was observed in 15 patients(44.1%). The average time between diagnosis and surgery was 14.08\u00b1 1.2 weeks for MAP protocol and 23.21\u00b1 1.96 weeks for Cisplatin/Doxorubicin. The relative DI was 0.65 for doxorubicin, 0.68 for Cisplatin and 0.75 for Methotrexate. Conclusions: DI is inadequate in many cases because of toxicity and the lack of sufficient beds in hospital, which results in delay on surgery. P-203 Clinical Outcome of Osteosarcoma in Children: Experience from a Developing Country A.S.B. Syed Khan1 Center, Pediatric Oncology, Lahore, Pakistan Background/Objectives: Osteosarcoma is the most common bone tumor in children. There is limited information about outcome for pediatric osteosarcoma in Pakistan. We conducted this study to determine the outcome of children with osteosarcoma who were diagnosed and treated in our institution over 10 years. Design/Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients with osteosarcoma who received treatment at our institution between January 2005 and December 2014. KaplanMeier analysis was used for survival analysis using SPSS version 19. Results: Osteosarcoma was diagnosed in 225 patients out of which 77 patients (34.2%) abandoned treatment within first 3 months of diagnosis. The final study population was 147. All patients received treatment with Cisplatin, Doxorubicin and Methotrexate as per Euromos 1 protocol. Mean age at diagnosis was 13.6 years (SD +/ 3.2). Male to female ratio was 1.7:1. 120 patients (81.6%) had nonmetastatic disease. 131 (89%) had lower extremity, 14 (9.5%) upper extremity and 2 (1.4%) had axial involvement. There were 28 (19%) mortalities (16 from disease progression, 8 from infectious complications and 4 from cardiac complications). 29 patients (19.7%) had disease progression during treatment while 24(16.3%) relapsed after end of treatment. The overall survival (OS) and event free survival (EFS) for entire population at eight years was 70% and 40% respectively with median followup of 43 months. For metastatic and nonmetastatic cases the OS and EFS were 57% and 72% and 19% and 52% respectively. None of the patients with axial tumor survived. For upper extremity and lower extremity tumors OS and EFS were 92% and 68% and 59% and 41 % respectively. There was no difference in survival based on gender. Conclusions: Survival for osteosarcoma is about 70% but EFS is lower than expected. Measures to improve care for infections and cardiac complications can improve these outcomes. Efforts to reduce abandonment are also needed. P-204 Treatment Abandonment in Patients with Osteosarcoma: Experience from a Developing Country H. Saeed1, S.A.S. Memorial Cancer Hospital & Research Center, Pediatric Oncology, Lahore, Pakistan Background/Objectives: Treatment abandonment is a common cause of cancer related mortality in developing countries especially in conditions that require mutilating surgery. We conducted this study to determine the patterns of treatment abandonment in patients of Osteosarcoma treated at our institution over 10 years. Design/Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients diagnosed with Osteosarcoma at our institution between January 2005 and December 2014. We compared characteristic of patients that continued treatment and that abandoned. SPSS version 19 was used for analysis. Results: Osteosarcoma was diagnosed in 225 patients out of which 77 patients (34.2%) abandoned treatment. Thus, about 8 patients a year did not complete treatment. About half of these (38 patients) abandoned prior to start of chemotherapy while the remaining 39 left following neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The mean age of treated group was 13.6 (SD+/3.2) and abandonment group was 14.4(SD+/2.6). Of the total 134 male patients 40 (30%) abandoned while 37 of 90 females (41%) abandoned. The likelihood ratio for abandonment for females was 3 (p= 0.056). None of the patients from Afghanistan abandoned, while 25% from Sindh and Baluchistan, 32.7% from KPK and 37.4 from Punjab abandoned treatment. 34% of patients with nonmetastatic and 37% with metastatic disease abandoned. Followup information was only available for 8 (10%) patients. 3 patients died of disease progression and 5 patients came back with progressive disease and were lost to followup again. Conclusions: There is high rate of treatment abandonment in Osteosarcoma patients at our institution. Half of the cases occur at time of surgery so better counseling and preparation of patients for amputation may reduce abandonment rates. Females also show a higher trend for abandonment. Disease prognosis and geographic distance from institution don't affect abandonment. There is need for better followup of patients who abandoned to know their outcomes. P-205 Epiphysis Growth after EpiphysealPreservation Surgery for Childhood Osteosarcoma Around the Knee Joint A. Takeuchi 1, N. Yamamoto1, K. Hayashi1, T. Higuchi1, Y. Araki1, H. Tsuchiya1 1Kanazawa University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Orthopaedic Surgery, Kanazawa, Japan Background/Objectives: Osteosarcoma usually occurs in metaphyseal locations and must be excised with the adjacent joint and replaced by an endoprosthesis. Recently, advanced imaging, accurate tumor excision and rigid fixation using a locking plate have been used in epiphysispreserved tumor excision for selected patients. To reconstruct the defect after epiphysispreserved tumor excision, various methods, including allograft, distraction osteogenesis, tumordevitalised autograft, vascularised have been applied. Tumordevitalised autograft treated with liquid nitrogen procedure was introduced in 1999 and its usefulness has since been reported. The advantages of frozen autografts include simplicity and the possibility of preserving proteins, including bone morphogenetic protein (BMP). We investigated postoperative epiphysis growth following epiphysealpreservation surgery for childhood osteosarcoma around the knee joint. Design/Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 13 patients with osteosarcoma who underwent epiphysispreserved tumor excision (transmetaphyseal, transphyseal and transepiphyseal excision) and reconstructed by using tumordevitalized autograft treated with liquid nitrogen. The mean patient age was 11 (range, 6 to 15) years. The mean followup periods were 59 (range, 30 to 93) months. Nine tumors were in the distal femur, and four were in the proximal tibia. Epiphysis transverse growth rate, epiphysiswidth discrepancy (EWD) and collapse of epiphysis were evaluated by using pre and postoperative whole standing leg radiographs. Functional outcome, complications and oncological status were also investigated. Results: The mean epiphysis growth rate was 9.7% (range, 0.5 to 28.0 %), mean EWD was 0.1mm (range, -1.7 to 3.2 mm), mean LLD was-29mm (range, -1 to -48 mm) and two patients underwent limb lengthening. There was no apparent collapse of the residual epiphysis. The mean MSTS score was 27.7 (range, 18 to 30). Conclusions: Epiphysis transverse growth continued after epiphysealpreservation surgery in childhood osteosarcoma. Epiphysealpreservation surgery in children should be considered. P-206 Prognostic Impact of Diagnostic and Treatment Delay in Children with Osteosarcoma L. Vasquez 1, A. Zapata2, S. Chavez2, Diseases INEN, Pediatric Oncology, Lima, Peru Background/Objectives: The aim of this study is to evaluate the relationship between latency to diagnosis (LD) and medical/nonmedical treatment delay (TD) and survival outcomes in children with osteosarcoma. Design/Methods: A retrospective analysis of all consecutively treated patients at the two major tertiary centers in childhood cancer of Peru (between January 2008 and December 2015) with diagnosis of osteosarcoma was performed. LD was measured as the time between start of symptoms and definitive diagnosis. TD was defined as any delay in weeks of the frontline treatment protocol. All causes of TD were evaluated as medical (neutropenia or severe infection) and extramedical (lack of available beds, surgical prosthesis or social problems). Overall survival (OS) and eventfree survival (EFS) were estimated and compared according to LD, TD and known prognostic factors. Results: A total of 113 patients were included in the study. Median LD was 17 weeks (range, 353.3). No association between clinical stage, tumor size and LD were detected. Children of parents without a formal job had significantly longer LD (p=0.018). Delayed LD was not associated to worse outcome. Multivariate analysis confirmed that OS and EFS were significantly worse for a TD longer than 4 weeks with a hazard ratio of 2.70 (95%CI, 1.116.76, p=0.003) and 1.13 (95%CI, 1.001.26, p=0.016) respectively. Only 15% of patients completed the treatment protocol in the initially established time. Most TD (85%) was caused by extramedical reasons, with no differences in survival rates between both groups (p=0.081). Conclusions: Longer LD in children with osteosarcoma did not seem to influence OS and EFS. A delay from any cause in the oncological treatment is independently associated with poor prognosis. Based on these results, further efforts are needed to decrease treatment delay in our country. Solid Non Brain Tumours Soft Tissue Sarcomas P-207 Treatment Outcome in Patients with Orbital Rhabdomyosarcoma Clinical Experience from a Regional Cancer Centre in North India A. Biswas 1, N. Adhikari1, S. Bakhshi2, S. Sen3, S. Kashyap3, R. Meel4, B. Mohanti1 1All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Radiation Oncology, New Delhi, India; 2All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Medical Oncology, New Delhi, India; 3All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Ocular Pathology, New Delhi, India; 4All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Ophthalmology, New Delhi, India Background/Objectives: Orbital Rhabdomyosarcoma(RMS) is a favourable prognostic tumour, where cure rates of more than 90% can be achieved with combination chemotherapy and local radiotherapy in trial setting. We intend to report the treatment outcome of patients with orbital RMS treated at our institute. Design/Methods: The treatment plan for patients diagnosed with orbital RMS was induction chemotherapy (VAC regimenVincristine,Actinomycin D, Cyclophosphamide) for 3 courses followed by orbital radiotherapy (45Gray/25fractions/5weeks) followed by further chemotherapy (VAC regimen) up to a total of 12 courses. Clinical data was collected by retrospective chart review from 201017. Overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) were analyzed by KaplanMeier method. Results: Twenty five patients met the study criterion (male: female=13:12). Median age at presentation was 13 years. The common symptoms (median duration 4 months) were proptosis, visual disturbance, ocular pain, eyelid swelling and ptosis in 80%,64%,28%,28% and 20% patients respectively. Orbital biopsy revealed embryonal and alveolar RMS in 21(84%) and 4(16%) patients respectively. After staging workup, 5(20%),17(68%) and 3(12%) patients had IRS clinical group II, III and IV disease respectively. Systemic chemotherapy(VAC) was administered in all patients (median6 courses). Orbital radiotherapy was given in 19(76%) patients(median dose 45 Gray;18curative;1palliative). After a mean followup of 18.11 months, 10(40%) patients had disease progression(local8,regional1,distant1). Two patients could be successfully salvaged with chemotherapy(ICE regimenIfosfamide,Carboplatin,Etoposide) and orbital exenteration. At last followup, 8(32%) patients had died 4 due to progressive disease and 4 due to chemotherapy related toxicity. Median PFS was 20.03 months and median OS was not reached. The actuarial rate of PFS and OS were respectively 46.9% and 64.6%(at 2 years) and 46.9% and 53.8%(at 3 years). Conclusions: Combination chemotherapy (VAC) and orbital radiotherapy (45Gy) led to modest clinical outcome in patients with orbital RMS at our centre possibly due to high incidence of alveolar RMS(16%), metastatic disease(12%), poor treatment compliance(20%) in Infants Under 6 Months: A Clinical, Histological and Molecular Analysis of the French Cohorts SIOP MMT 8995, RMS 2005 and National Cancer Registry T. Butler 1, D. Ranch\u00e8reVince2, G. Pierron3, D. Orbach4, L. Galmiche5, Background/Objectives: Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common soft tissue tumor in childhood with 2 major subtypes: alveolar and embryonal tumors. RMS in infants, 410% of RMS, is a particular entity with specific clinical presentation and outcome. Recently, molecular rearrangement involving NCOA2 or VGGL2 genes have been described in congenital spindle cell RMS (S/ScRMS). Design/Methods: Our retrospective study reviewed all clinical, histological and molecular data from infants aged less than 6 months at diagnosis and treated in France for a RMS (registered in MMT89, MMT95, RMS2005 or recorded in the French National Cancer Registry). A histological centralized review and molecular analysis were performed on tumoral tissue of each patient. Results: 45 infants were included with a median age of 2.4 months at diagnosis. 6(13%) were metastatic and 7 patients (16%) had congenital malformations. Considering only survivors, the median followup was 6.2 years. OS and EFS rates for all patients were 59.8% (95%CI, 4777) and 47% (95%CI, 14 relapsed (31%), mostly locoregional, and 9 (20%) progressed early. a PAXFOXO1 translocation was identified in 2 patients. 2 VGLL2related RMS were recorded, both localized and with a common spindle cell histologic appearance. The two are alive in first CR. Molecular analysis for the 25 remaining patients are ongoing (CGH array, FISH, RTPCR and if all negatives RNAseq). 29(81%) infants did not present any grade III or IV toxicities. 31 infants received ifosfamide, among (24 with aged less than 6 months). One tubular toxicity and 3 neurologic toxicities were recorded for infants treated with ifosfamide. Conclusions: Our results suggest that a subtype of neonatal RMS does exist, with specific a clinical, histological (S/ScRMS) and/or molecular presentation (VGLL2, NCOA2 fusions). P-209 Role of PETCT in Evaluation of Therapy Response for Pediatric Rhabdomyosarcoma E. Elnadi 1, M. Mohamed S Zaghlol1,2, G. Taha3, H. Hafez4, S. Abdel Hamid5, Khalaf9, E.

Role of PETCT in staging pediatric RMS has not been clearly established, this study aimed to investigate the role PET in evaluation of response to treatment and its correlation with survival in pediatric patients with RMS. Design/Methods: A retrospective study included children with intermediate risk RMS presented to CCHE period from Jan, 2010 to June, 2016. They were stratified and treated based on COG protocol study ARST0531. The patients did initial PET scan and then at w 4 and at w 15. Results: We reported 138 patients who had initial PET, 18 excluded with negative PET and 120 patients were analyzed. Age ranged from 0.02 years to 14 years old with median 4.095. Eighty seven cases had embryonal pathology and 33 were of alveolar type. Fifty one patients did PET CT on week 4, 36 patients were negative and 15 patients were positive. Sixty six patients did PET CT at W 15, 58 patients were negative PET and 8 patients were still positive. OS% for negative patients at W4 was 86.6% \u00b1 0.143 at 5 years in IN PET positive and was 66.7% at W15 (P for Value: 0.452). Conclusions: Patients with negative PET at W4 had better outcome. Results was insignificant due to small number of pet negative patients. PET scan can be a tool to predict outcome in RMS P-210 Outcome of Vaginal Tumors in Pediatric Age Group; Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt (CCHE) 57357 Experience M.

Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), germ cell tumors and adenocarcinoma are the most common malignancies of the vagina. To analyze the outcome of children with vaginal tumors who were treated at a single institution. Design/Methods: A Retrospective chart review of all pediatric patients with vaginal tumors treated at CCHE57357 from June 2007 till June 2016. Results: Nineteen patients (median age, 2.7 years; range, 0.72 12.15 years) were studied. Three different histological subtypes were identified; RMS in 11 patients, germ cell tumor in 7 cases, and clear cell adenocarcinoma in one patient. Vaginal Bleeding was the most common clinical presentation, reported in (65%) of the patients. Surgery was done for 6 patients (33%) (4 with uterine salvage and 2 underwent hysterectomy).Thirteen patients (72.2%) remain diseasefree with median followup of 36 months. Only one patient with RMS died out of disease progression. The 3 year OS and EFS for patients with RMS were 88.9% and 80% respectively, while for those with germ cell tumors the OS was 100% and EFS was 66.7%. Conclusions: Vaginal tumors are rare in the pediatric population and generally have a good prognosis. Treatment with chemotherapy only or with either conservative surgery or brachytherapy may achieve an excellent outcome in germ cell tumors and rhabdomyosarcoma. P-211 Radiotherapy in the Local Management of Aggressive Fibromatosis: Efficacy is Inversely Proportional to Age J. Bates1, C. Morris1, N. Iovino1, D. 2 College of Medicine, Radiation Oncology, Gainesville, USA; 2University of Florida College of Medicine, Radiation Oncology, Jacksonville, USA; 3University of Florida College of Medicine, Orthopaedics and Rehabilition, Gainesville, USA Background/Objectives: Aggressive fibromatosis, also called desmoid tumor, is a locally aggressive nonmalignant disease affecting patients across all ages. Although radiotherapy has an established role in disease management, crossstudy comparison suggests effectiveness is inversely proportional to patient age. Our goal was to comprehensively describe local control across all ages using a large singleinstitution cohort. Design/Methods: We retrospectively analyzed all patients treated with radiotherapy for desmoid tumor at a single institution from 1975-2015. Demographic, tumorrelated, and treatmentrelated information was abstracted from patient charts. KaplanMeier analysis, logistic regression, and Cox proportional hazards models were used to analyze the effect of various factors on local control following radiotherapy. Results: A total of 101 patients were identified with a median followup of 14.3 years (range, 0.3-41.5). At 5 and 10 years, the overall survival rates were 98% and 94% and overall local control rates were 82% and 78%. Most patients were female (66%) and white (66%); 15% were <20 years old at diagnosis, 47% were 20 to <40, and 39% were 40 years or older. The cohorts were split evenly between patients with initial versus recurrent disease at the time of radiotherapy. On univariate analysis, the only factors predicting for increased risk of local recurrence was young age at diagnosis (<20, 72% local control; p = 0.008). Logistic regression confirmed a relationship between increasing age and increasing probability of local control (p = 0.004). Conclusions: Younger patients with aggressive fibromatosis exhibit more frequent local failures than older patients, suggesting that tumor biology and radioresponsiveness may differ with age. Younger patients may benefit from alternate approaches to local therapy or radiationdose escalation. C. 1,2,3, A. Lef\u00e8vreUtile4, Malan5, S.

Chromosome 7 germline terminal macrodeletions have been implicated in human congenital malformations and developmental delays. We herein decipher a novel phenotype a heterozygous macrodeletion of 7q34q36.3 in a 16yearold girl originally from West Indies. Design/Methods: Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) array in the patient was significant for 7q34q36.3 macrodeletion of 16 megabase pairs (Mbp). To investigate the of inheritance, Affymetrix GenomeWide Human SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) Array 6.0 was performed in the patient and her mother (father not available), and data were analyzed using PennCNV Software. Human herpesvirus8 (HHV8) genotype was performed by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and comparative sequence analysis was utilized to demonstrate the origin of HHV8 viral strain. Results: We herein describe a novel heterozygous macrodeletion The HHV8 viral strain belongs to the SubSaharan African B subtype, and clustered with strains previously characterized from Cameroon and Uganda. Similar to previously reported cases of germline chromosome 7q terminal deletions, our patient has dental malposition, and developmental (growth and intellectual) delay. Novel phenotypic features include Kaposi sarcoma, HHV8driven Kaposi sarcoma, in a child otherwise normally resistant to other infectious agents and without any other tumoral lesion, points to a very selective immunodeficiency. While defects in organogenesis have been described with chromosome 7 terminal macrodeletions, this is the first report of immunodeficiency and cancer predisposition syndrome (KOMS Syndrome) associated with this chromosomal region. P-213 Local Control for Non Metastatic GenitoUrinary Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). A Single Centre Experience J. Lopes 1, K. Parashar1, L. McCarthy1, A. Hospital, Oncology, Birmingham, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: Recent studies show 5year survival of localized genitourinary RMS patients of 77%. Though recent publications have advocated more conservative surgery, in our surgical centre emphasis is placed on achieving complete local control of disease with surgery if at all possible. Our principle behind considering radical surgery was the belief of the importance of clear margins and avoidance of radiotherapy. Design/Methods: We reviewed the notes of all patients identified by the pathology database with RMS treated at our center over the last 15 years. Results: From 2001 to 2016 we treated 12 patients for localized genitourinary RMS. 7:5 M:F, median age 1.7y (2mo with in uterus(1), vagina(2), bladder/ prostate(9). All patients had preoperative chemotherapy. Surgery decisions were based on preoperative imaging, examination under anaesthesia, laparoscopy and cystoscopy. One team of two surgeons performed: radical hysterectomy (2), vaginectomy (1), pelvic exenteration (1), partial cystectomy (2), total cystectomy (1), cystoprostatectomy (4). 3/6 patients have had urinary undiversion. Two patients did not have surgery 1 with an unresectable tumour; 1 with near total resolution of his bladder neck tumour. Four patients had radiotherapy 1 with an unresectable tumour and 3 with positive resection margins. Mean follow up is 6 years (9mo - 13.3 years) with 100% survival. Two patients suffered local recurrence. A patient post partial vaginectomy, later required pelvic exenteration and postoperative radiotherapy, and is now 10 years recurrence free. A patient post partial cystectomy, had chemotherapy post relapse, and is now 4.5 years recurrence free. Conclusions: In our series survival was 100%. The 2 local recurrences had conservative surgery initially. Radical surgery was performed in 8/10 patients. Although there is a trend for conservative surgery we believe this should be judged against the high survival rates that come with good surgical local control. We reserve radiotherapy for those with incomplete resections. P-214 Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma of Paediatric Meel1, S. Kashyap2, S. Sen2, M. Bajaj1 1All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Dr Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences, New Delhi, India; 2All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Dept of Ocular Pathology Dr Rajendra Prasad Centre for 1% of all sarcomas. It occurs most commonly in the lower extremities and rarely in orbit. It is commonly misdiagnosed due to its rarity and nonspecific clinical findings Design/Methods: Retrospective review of medical records, histopathology and imaging findings of all cases of ASPS of paediatric orbit that were treated at our centre between Jan 2001 and Dec 2016 (16 years). Results: Four cases of ASPS of orbit presenting in childhood were analysed. The median age of presentation was 8.5 months (range 3.5 12 years). There were 2 male and 2 female patients. All 4 patients presented with proptosis of left eye. The median duration of symptoms was 8 months (range 3 months - 1 year). The initial clinical and imaging diagnosis was low flow vascular malformation (capillary haemangioma) in 3 cases and pseudotumor in 1 case. Imaging revealed a well defined lesion in all 4 cases. There was no bone erosion or extraorbital extension in any case. The lesion involved lateral orbit in 2, superior orbit in 1 and inferior orbit in 1 case. Ultrasound revealed a homogeneous lesion with regular internal architecture. One case underwent exenteration, while 3 underwent orbitotomy for tumor excision. Conclusions: Orbital ASPS is a rare malignancy of childhood, and may masquerade other benign tumors of orbit. P-215 Treatment Outcome of FourDrug Versus ThreeDrug Regimen for Osteosarcoma: A Single Institute Experience Ju1, P. ByungKiu1, P. Seog Yun2, K. Guy3, Jong Hyung4, K. Mimi1, P. Hyeon Jin 1 1National Cancer Center, Pediatric Oncology Center, Goyangsi, Republic of Korea; 2National Cancer Center, Department of Pathology, Goyangsi, Republic of Korea; 3National Cancer Center, Republic of Korea; 4Hallym University Chuncheon Sacred Heart Hospital, Department of Pediatrics, Chuncheon, Republic of Korea Background/Objectives: In osteosarcoma treatment, extent of tumor necrosis at the time of surgery following preoperative chemotherapy is known to be strongly associated with survival rate. We conducted a retrospective study to see if difference in tumor necrosis and treatment outcome comes from addition of ifosfamide to conventional threedrug regimen. Design/Methods: Patients who had been treated at the National Cancer Center from 2002 to 2015 were evaluated. As a fourdrug regimen, 2 courses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy included 9g/m\u00b2. Adjuvant chemotherapy was tailored according to tumor necrosis: good responders received 2 courses of doxorubicin 90 9g/m\u00b2, methotrexate 12 g/m\u00b2, and cisplatin additional of ifosfamide 9g/m\u00b2, methotrexate 12 g/m\u00b2, or AOST 0331 regimen was performed. Results: Total 26 patients were included in the study. Median age at the time of diagnosis was 15.9 (10.336.7) years. Twelve (46.2%) patients were treated with three drugs from 2002 to 2012. Remaining 14 (53.8%) patients were treated with 4 drugs from 2009 to 2015. Fourdrug regimen yielded higher proportion of good responder when compared to threedrugregimen (71.4% vs. 41.7%) (OR 3.5, P=0.233). 5 year survival rate of the former group was 76.2%, and that of latter group was 50% (P=0.64). Eventfree survival of the former group was 64.3%, and that of latter group was 33.3% (P=0.348). Conclusions: There was no difference between four and threedrug regimens with regard to necrosis rate, overall survival, and eventfree survival. However, small sample size could have precluded statistical difference, considering the apparent difference in treatment results between two groups. Further study in a larger scale is warranted to reach a solid conclusion. P-216 Prognostic Value of Molecular Alterations in Infantile Spindle Cell Rhabdomyosarcoma E. Pozzo 1, M. DebiecRychter2, Leuven, Belgium; 3KU Leuven is (ERMS), alveolar (ARMS), or spindle cell (SRMS). SRMS is an uncommon subtype of RMS with agedependent genetic characteristics. Recent molecular analyses have described NCOA2 and/or VGLL2 rearrangements in the majority of infantile SRMS and their overall good prognosis. Here, we sought to identify the presence of these molecular aberrations in infantile SRMS patients and investigate their correlation with observed clinical outcome. Design/Methods: The samples from children diagnosed with RMS between 1990 and 2016 at our hospital (n=84) were analyzed with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), arrayCGH and assessed for clinicopathological characteristics and survival. Patients who were diagnosed with RMS before 12 months of age were considered for this study. Results: Nine patients were diagnosed with infantile RMS, and three of them were histologically identified as infantile SRMS. Sites of primary disease of infantile SRMS patients included paravertebral, gluteal and periscapular muscles, with FISH analysis revealing absence of NCOA2 and/or VGGL2 rearrangements. Patients were allocated to RMS 2005 subgroup D treatment; following chemotherapeutic course, 2/3 patients underwent surgical removal with 0/3 patients requiring radiotherapy and one patient receiving 4 months of maintenance therapy (cyclophosphamide and vinorelbine) to avoid mutilating effects of radiotherapy. Two patients out of three had treatmentrelated toxicities including nephrotoxicity and temporary neurotoxicity. Compared to infantile ERMS and ARMS patients (66.7% survival, 54.3 months median followup), all patients with SRMS at followup were alive and well, with one longterm followup of 55 months. To date, no patients developed local recurrence nor distant metastases. Conclusions: Although patients with infantile SRMS were negative for NCOA2 or VGGL2 rearrangements, the good prognosis and eventfree survival were not affected. Further studies are needed to identify novel molecular aberrations in infantile SRMS that could correlate with prognosis and eventfree survival. P-217 Promising use of Rapamycin in an INFANT with Rare Smooth Muscle Cell Tumor of Nose and Upper LIP M. Ramzan 1, S. Katewa1 1Manipal Hospital, Pediatric Hematology Jaipur, India Background/Objectives: Smooth muscle tumor (SMT) are rare in children and very difficult to treat. mTOR inhibitors like rapamycin (sirolimus) are a type of targeted therapy that stops the protein that helps cells divide and survive. mTOR inhibitors are being studied to treat perivascular epithelioid cell tumors (PEComas) and epithelioid hemangioendothelioma. Use of rapamycin has not been mentioned in literature for treatment of SMT. Design/Methods: We report a 5 month old infant first product of nonconsanguineous marriage who had swelling over tip of nose and face since birth. Results: CT scan showed lobulated soft tissue mass of 22x39mm. PET CT revealed localized FDG avid lobulated, heterogeneous, enhancing mass of 34x37x41.6mm involving right side of nose, upper lip and adjoining cheek in the pre maxillary region with calcification. Histopathology showed of spindle cell with fusiform nuclei and indistinct eosinophilic cytoplasm arranged in fascicles, was of sarcoma, likely to be embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. However, immunohistochemistry was strongly positive for SMA and negative for desmin, myogenin, caldesmon, S100, CD34 with Ki 67 of 5% (low to intermediate grade smooth muscle tumor). He was started on vincristine, actinomycin and cyclophosphamide (VAC) chemotherapy. At 6 weeks, mass reduced in size clinically so another 6 weeks of VAC given. After 12 weeks of chemo CT scan still showed mass of 31x21x26 mm. He was then started on only rapamycin 0.5 mg daily. After 8 weeks his facial swelling has significantly reduced clinically. CT showed residual mass of 21\u00d712\u00d721mm. Currently this infant is on rapamycin and doing well. Conclusions: Rapamycin treatment was promising in this case of SMT. Further role of this drug has to be investigated in large clinical trial in SMT. P-218 Does Extent of Surgery Affect Fibrosarcoma Outcomes? 1, J. Sola1, O. Picado1, E. Perez1 1University of Miami Miller School of Medicine/Jackson Memorial Hospital, Pediatric Surgery, miami, USA Background/Objectives: To determine whether surgery type has any prognostic indications for survival in fibrosarcomas. Design/Methods: We reviewed patients <20 years of age diagnosed with fibrosarcomas from 19732013, who had any type of surgery, in the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database. KaplanMeier analyses demonstrated diseasespecific survival (DSS) for clinical and pathologic variables. Significant covariate predictors of DSS as determined by univariate analysis were analyzed using Cox regression. Results: We identified 1,163 pediatric patients. The mean age at diagnosis was 12 \u00b1 6 years. There was no gender predilection, with a malefemale ratio of 1:1. Most (54%) were White and 18% were Black. The majority (59%) were classified as localized tumors, 28% had regional involvement, and 3% had distant metastases. The majority of patients required surgery (93%), and only 8% required radiation. Overall DSS was 91% at 5 years, 90% at 10 years, and 89% at 15 years. Of the 639 patients who had surgery, site of tumor, grade, SEER stage, and radiation were all significant using univariate KaplanMeier survival analyses. Multivariate Cox regression showed that tumor stage was an independent determinant of survival, however surgical procedure type (local versus aggressive resections) showed no significance. Conclusions: Fibrosarcomas are rare in pediatric populations. Although stage is an independent determinant of survival, surgical procedure type (local versus more aggressive resections) did not show significance in a multivariate model. Aggressive surgical resection of fibrosarcomas is not associated with increased survival. P-219 Lymph Node Ratios Predict DiseaseSpecific Mortality in Pediatric Rhabdomyosarcoma K. Rao 1, J. Sola1, H. Neville1, A. Hogan1, E. Perez1 1University of Miami Miller School of Medicine/Jackson Memorial Hospital, Pediatric Surgery, miami, USA Background/Objectives: Lymph node involvement is associated with increased local recurrence rates and decreased survival rates in pediatric rhabdomyosarcoma. We sought to determine whether lymph node ratio (LNR) predicts diseasespecific mortality (DSM). Design/Methods: We identified patients <20 years of age diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma from 19882013 in the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database. We calculated LNR's by taking the number of nodes positive/ total number of nodes examined. We used KaplanMeier estimates to plot DSM for clinical and pathologic variables and Cox regression to evaluate LNR in models. Results: Our study presented 188 cases with both lymph node data and greater than three nodes examined. Median age at diagnosis was 9.5 years (215), 64% were male and 74% were White. The stage at presentation was 36% localized, 42% regional, and 16% distantly metastasized. Fortyeight percent of patients received radiation therapy after surgery. The median number of nodes examined was 7 (414) and mean LNR was 0.13 \u00b1 0.26. The mean survival was 89 \u00b1 76 months. Overall 5year DSM was 13% for 5 years, and 18%, for 10, 15, and 20 years. The largest threshold for LNR associated with DSM was 0.75. Fiveyear survival was 82% for LNR < 0.75 versus 15% for LNR 0.75 (p<0.003). Lymph node status, stage and LNR were significant determinants of DSM on univariate analysis. Using Cox regression with all significant covariates, LNR and stage remained independent determinants of DSM. Conclusions: Pediatric rhabdomyosarcomas are rare. LNR is an independent determinant of DSM. Using 0.75 as a threshold may offer further value in DSM prognostication. P-220 Clinicopathologic Spectrum of a Series of Rhabdomyosarcomas Diagnosed at a Tertiary Cancer Referral Centre, Mumbai, India B. Rekhi 1, C. Gupta1, S. Qureshi2, G. Bajpai3, N. 1tata memorial hospital, Surgical Pathology, India; 2tata memorial hospital, Surgical Oncology, mumbai, India; 3tata memorial Medical Oncology, mumbai, India; Radiation Oncology, mumbai, India Background/Objectives: Spindle cell/sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a relatively newly recognized subtype of RMS. Immunohistochemically; high myogenin expression is associated with alveolar RMS (ARMS) and an aggressive clinical course. Design/Methods: This study was aimed at evaluating clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical features of 300 cases of RMS. Immunohistochemical expression of myogenin and MyoD1 was graded, based on percentage of tumor cells displaying positive intranuclear immunostaining, such as grade 1(125%); grade 2(2650%); grade 3(5176%) and grade 4(76100%). Followup details were available in 272(90.7%) patients. Various clinicopathologic parameters were correlated with 3year diseasefree and overall survival. Results: Most cases, including various subtypes, except pleomorphic RMS, occurred in the first two decades (228 cases)(76%), in males and in the head and neck region (126)(42%), followed by extremities (59)(19.7%). The most common subtype was ARMS (140 cases)(46.7%), followed by embryonal RMS and MyoD1 in 192/266(72.2%) tumors. High myogenin expression (more than, equal to 51% positive tumor cells) was significantly associated with cases of ARMS (95/121,78.5%), as compared to other subtypes(48/117, 41%).(p<0.001). High MyoD1 expression was seen in more cases of pure sclerosing, combined with spindle cell/ sclerosing RMSs(10/10, 100%), as compared to the other subtypes(91/141, 67.4%)(p=0.032) There was no significant difference between high myogenin expression and diseasefree survival and/ or 3 year overall survival. Children, especially in first decade; patients with tumor sizes less than 5cm; without metastasis and at an early tumor stage, showed significantly better survival outcomes. Conclusions: There was significant association between high myogenin expression and cases of ARMSs and high MyoD1 expression and cases of spindle cell/sclerosing RMS. Children in first decade, with smaller sized tumors, presenting at early stage had relatively better outcomes. High myogenin expression was not found to be related with aggressive clinical outcomes. P-221 RadachlorinBased Photodynamic Therapy of Soft Tissue Sarcoma in Children N. Rostovtsev 1, S. Kovalenko1 1Regional Children Hospital, Surgery department, Chelyabinsk, Russia Background/Objectives: The aim of our research was to assess the effectiveness and the period of intraoperative phototoxicity of radachlorin mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT). To treat malignant tumors characterized by far and near infrared absorption band (650800 nm) in children we used the secondgeneration photosensitizer radachlorin (654662 nm absorption band). This agent is nontoxic, shows a high photodynamic activity, and has a good contrast ratio (to 10:1) and a fine clearance. Design/Methods: During a tenyear period (20072017), seventeen patients with primary soft tissue sarcoma (10 cases of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, 3 cases of mixed rhabdomyosarcoma, and 4 cases of alveolar fibrosarcoma) were treated. PDT was predominantly inpatient (intraoperative). In one case of alveolar fibrosarcoma, PDT was performed on an outpatient basis. All children were admitted to hospital with an advanced stage of disease (tumors ranged from 10 to 20 cm in diameter and were mainly T34, sometimes T2). Results: Treatment based on chlorin photosensitizer mediated PDT did not cause systemic or local events and was well tolerated by all patients including children with a concomitant disease. Due to fast accumulation of radachlorin in tumor, it was possible to use laser in 14 hours after intravenous administration of the agent. Therapeutic effect was observed in all patients including complete tumor resorption in 19 cases (58.8%) and partial resorption in 7 cases (41.2%). Conclusions: Chlorin photosensitizers have a high photodynamic activity and fine therapeutic effects; they are quickly excreted from the body and, due to a fast clearance, do not induce the prolonged light sensitivity. This erases the problem of the longterm cutaneous phototoxicity. Thanks to a fast accumulation in tumor with a high contrast gradient between tumor and normal tissues, chlorin photosensitizers make it possible to reduce the number of PDT sessions and to achieve positive therapeutic outcomes. P-222 Prognostic Impact of Circulating Endothelial Cells and Endothelial Progenitor Cells on Treatment Response and Survival of Pediatric Patients with Solid Tumors H. Sayed 1, A. Zahran2 1South Egypt Cancer Institute, Pediatric Oncology, Assiut, Egypt; Cancer Institute, Clinical Pathology, Assiut, Egypt Background/Objectives: Neoangiogenesis plays an important role in growth and spread of pediatric solid tumors. The levels of circulating endothelial cells (CECs) and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) have been documented as indicators of the vascular function in cancer. Here, we evaluated the role of these cells in pediatric solid tumors and their prognostic impact. Design/Methods: A prospective study included 70 patients with different pediatric solid tumors treated with different types of chemotherapy in addition to 20 age and sex matched healthy children as controls. Blood samples collected at diagnosis then at day 7 and day 21 after chemotherapy. Samples assessed for CECs and EPCs using the flowcytometry. Results: The mean levels of CECs and EPCs of patients at diagnosis were significantly higher than controls (85.29\u00b124.78 and 26.1\u00b19.11 versus 20.08\u00b16.65; and EPCs; 2.78\u00b11.48 respectively; p < 0.001 for both). The highest levels of CECs was observed in patients with rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). An overall increase was reported in CECs and after the first cycle of chemotherapy, that was significantly correlated to treatment response and overall survival. Conclusions: As the highest levels of CECs was observed in our patients who respond to therapy, the magnitude of increase of CECs at day 7 after chemotherapy might be used as very early predictor of response to therapy and outcome but further study on larger population is necessary to confirm that. P-223 Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma in Children and Adolescents: Treatment Results of the Five Cooperative Weichteilsarkom Studiengruppe Trials (CWS) M. SparberSauer 1, G. Oncology, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland; 10University of Frankfurt, Hospital for Children and Adolescents, Frankfurt, Germany; 11University Children\u00b4s Hospital, Department of Pediatric Surgery and Children\u00b4s t(X;17)(p11;q25) leading to ASPSLTFE3. Design/Methods: The clinical data of 61 children and adolescents with ASPS, treated according to recommendations for \"adult type\" NRSTS in five prospective trials of the Cooperative Weichteilsarkom Studiengruppe (CWS) (19872015), were analyzed. Results: Median age was 14 years [range: 3-20]. The tumour was mainly located in the extremities (75%). 46 patients had localized (LD) and 15 metastatic disease (MD). 34/46 patients with LD R2 n=3), 7 of the LD patients received RT additionally. All 37 patients are alive, 30/37 patients in complete remission (CR). CHT after primary resection (n=17) or biopsy (n=7) was given in 12/46 patients with LD and 12/15 MD. In 7 patients response was assessable: 2 partial, 4 stable disease and 1 progression. In 12/24 patients a secondary resection was performed, in 3 RT was added: 8/12 patients were in CR in comparison to 4/12 patients without secondary resection. After a median followup of 6 years (range: 0.2- 16.5), 45/46 patients with localized and 8/15 patients with MD were alive: 36/45 and 2/8 in complete remission, the others mostly in stable disease. 10 yr overall survival (OS) and event free survival (EFS) were 88% and 65% respectively. Age<10 years, IRS IIII, size or R1 (primary or delayed) resection correlated with favorable prognosis concerning EFS and OS. Conclusions: Prognosis of patients with ASPS when treated in prospective trials is comparable to prognosis of patients with rhabdomyosarcoma. Primary or delayed complete tumour resection correlates with long term survival. P-224 Family History of MPNST Among Individuals with NF1 IS Associated with Increased Incidence and Earlier Development of MPNST M. Spira 1, F. Malbari 2, P. Knight3, J. Gill4, I. Abbott5, 1Albert College of Medicine, Bronx, USA; Hospital at Montefiore, Department of Neurology, Bronx, USA; 3Children's Tumor Foundation, Research & Medical Programs, New York, USA; 4Children's Hospital at Montefiore, Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology and Marrow and Blood Cell Transplantation, Bronx, USA; 5Children's Hospital at Montefiore, Department of Neurosurgery, Bronx, USA Background/Objectives: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a relatively common autosomal dominant tumor predisposition syndrome. Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are the leading cause of death in young adults with NF1. The reported incidence of MPNST among individuals with NF1 varies, and there is little information regarding the risk factors for developing MPNST in this patient population. Design/Methods: Individuals with NF1 registered with the Children's Tumor Foundation's Neurofibromatosis Registry were emailed an anonymous 15minute survey regarding personal and family history of NF1 and MPNST, ages of onset, and symptomatology. Participation was voluntary and information was selfreported and not verified by individual health records. Results: The survey was sent to 4801 registrants and had 878 responses (18.3% response rate). Among all respondents having at least one blood relative diagnosed with MPNST, 19.4% developed MPNST themselves. This was significantly higher than the incidence of MPNST among respondents who reported a negative family history of MPNST (7.5%, p=0.021). The presence of a positive family history for MPNST was found to be a risk factor for development of MPNST (OR2.975; 95% CI 1.2327.187). In addition, NF1 patients with MPNST and a positive family history of MPNST were significantly more likely to have developed the disease prior to age 10 than those with a negative family history of MPNST (42.9% vs 7.0%, p=0.029), These patients were also more likely to develop MPNST before age 20, however the difference was not significant (71.4% vs 32.6%, p=0.089). Conclusions: These results suggest that a positive family history of MPNST represents a risk factor for the development of MPNST. This data supports consideration for implementing enhanced screening for this atrisk population. Furthermore, since the results also suggest an earlier onset of disease in individuals with a positive family history of MPNST, screening should be carefully considered particularly for patients less than 10 years. P-225 Prognostic Factors and Survival in Children with Rhabdomyosarcoma: Experience at the Instituto Nacional De Enfermedades Neoplasicas and Hospital Rebagliati C. Ugaz Lima, Lima, Peru Background/Objectives: Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is still one of the neoplasms with poor prognosis in our country despite the improvement in the worldwide cure rate. The aim of this study is to determine survival and associated prognostic factors of this entity. Design/Methods: Retrospective cohort study. All infants and children younger than 14 years with RMS treated at the Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplasicas (INEN) and Hospital Rebagliati between May 1990 and December 2016 were reviewed. Results: A total of 252 children were identified, 124 patients (49.2%) were male and 128 (50.8%) female. The median age was 5 years (range, 1 month 14 years). The most frequent histological type was embryonal (76.9%) and 41.5% of patients had metastatic disease at onset. With a median followup of 26 months, the 5year overall survival (OS) rate for localized and metastatic RMS was 69.3% (standard error, SE 5.32%) and 21.8% (SE 6.29 %) respectively. Fiveyear eventfree survival (EFS) for localized and metastatic RMS was 48.0% (SE 5.45%) and 12.3% (SE 4.32%), respectively. Eleven patients had no survival data. In the multivariate analysis, the presence of metastases (P=0.001), histological type (P=0.014), surgical margins (P=0.001), clinicalsurgical group (P=0.001) and stage (P=0.001) significantly affected OS. There was a significant improvement in 5year OS according to decades (30.5% in 1990 1999, 40.0% in 2000 2009 and 54.5% in 2010 2016, P=0.001). Age, gender, provenance, tumor size and histological subtype did not affect significantly OS. Conclusions: Survival rates in patients with RMS are lower than those reported in developed countries, although there is evidence of improvement in recent years. It is necessary to optimize the multidisciplinary management of this disease. P-226 PencilBeam Scanned Protons for the Treatment of Ewing's Sarcoma Patients: Results from the Paul Scherrer Institute D.C. Weber 1, F. Murray1, D. Antunes Correia1, for Proton Therapy, Villigen, Switzerland Background/Objectives: Few data exist regarding the clinical outcome of patients with Ewing's sarcoma (EWS) treated with pencilbeam scanning proton therapy (PT). We report the local/distant control rates, survivorship and late toxicity of children, adolescents and young adults (AYA) treated at the Paul Scherrer Institute. Design/Methods: Thirtyeight patients (median age, 9.9 years) were identified. A total of 24 male and 14 female patients received a median dose of 54.9 GyRBE (range, 45.069.6). Size of the tumor ranged from 1.7 to 24 cm (median, 6.7). Most common primary site was axial/pelvic (n=27; 71%). Four patients (11%) presented with metastasis at diagnosis. Twenty (53%) patients had chemoPT only. Median follow up was 49.6 months (range, 9.2131.7). Results: The 5year actuarial rate of local control (LC), metastasisfree survival (MFS) and overall survival (OS) were 81.5%, 76.4% and 83.0%, respectively. All local recurrences occurred in field and in patients with nonextremity primaries. Six patients died, all of tumor progression. Age < 10 years was a favorable factor for LC (p=0.05) and OS (p=0.05) of borderline significance but was significant for MFS (p=0.003). Tumor volume < 200 ml were favorable prognostic factors for DFS (p=0.03) and OS (p=0.07). Acute toxicity was limited to grade 12 skin erythema or mucositis. Only 2 (6.9%) grade 3 late toxicities were observed. The 5year actuarial rate of grade 3 toxicityfree survival was 90.9%. Conclusions: These preliminary data suggests that the outcomes of children and AYA with EWS were good and PT was well tolerated with very few late adverse events. The local and distant tumor control for older patients with large prePT tumor volumes remains problematic in these challenging patients. P-227 Clinical Characteristics and Prognosis of Pediatric Rhabdomyosarcoma in SCMC H. yali 1, G. yijin1 1Shanghai Children's Medical Center SCMC Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, Shanghai, China Background/Objectives: The objective of this study was to determine treatment outcomes in pediatric patients with rhabdomyosarcoma treated at the Shanghai Children's Medical Center (SCMC). Design/Methods: A retrospective chart review of 108 pediatric patients (< 19 y old) with Rhabdomyosarcoma(RMS) diagnosed between 2005 and 2014 was performed. According to the pathological subtype, TNM stage and postoperative pathologic staging, the patients divided into four groups: lowrisk group, intermediaterisk group, highrisk group and distant metastatic group. The KaplanMeier survival analysis and Cox regression multivariate analysis were used to assess prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) and eventfree survival (EFS). Results: The median age at diagnosis was 65.5 months. The median followup for living patients was 44.3 months and the median followup for all patients was 36.9 months. The most common primary sites arose in the others (includes abdomen, trunk, retroperitoneum, etc.) (32.4%). The 5year OS and EFS for all patients were 86.1% and 72.2% and for metastatic disease were 58.8% and 29.4%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, metastatic disease at presentation, 1y or10y, tumor size 5cm were associated with worse EFS (P < 0.05). Metastatic disease at presentation was associated with worse OS (P < 0.05). The estimated 5years EFS rate for four groups (lowrisk group, intermediaterisk group, highrisk group and distant metastatic group) 71.4%, 85.1%, 75.7%, and 29.4%, respectively (P < 0.001). The estimated 5years OS rate for four groups was 85.7%, 95.7%, 86.5% and 58.8%, respectively (P < 0.001). Conclusions: RMS patients with distinct groups have different outcomes in the SCMC, which is quite similarly to the worldwide data. However, this study need for longterm followup of RMS survivors for analysis of prognosis factors. Solid Non Brain Tumours Retinoblastoma P-228 ClinicoDemographic Profile of Retinoblastoma Patients Seen in Tertiary Referral Centers in MANILA, Philippines (20142016) A.P. Alcasabas 1, B. Gepte2, P. Fajardo1, J. Lecciones2 1University Philippine General Hospital, Paediatrics, Manila, Philippines; 2Philippine Children's Medical Center, Pediatrics, Manila, Philippines; 3University of Philippines Philippine General Hospital, Opthalmology, Manila, Philippines; 4St. Luke's Medical Center, Pediatrics, Quezon City, Philippines Background/Objectives: Retinoblastoma has a high incidence in the Philippines (16.5 per million children 04 years). In Luzon, the country's largest island, 90 cases are expected annually. Two government pediatric cancer units in Manila started a retinoblastoma program in October 2013 involving adoption of a uniform stagebased protocol, patient navigation, data management and communitybased health worker education on early warning signs. We report the clinicodemographic profiles of children diagnosed from January 1, 2014 - December 31, 2016. Design/Methods: Prospective data collection of all consecutive patients and review Results: A total of 119 cases were seen. Eightytwo had unilateral retinoblastoma, 35 bilateral, and 2 trilateral. Mean age (months) at diagnosis: unilateral 29 (3108); bilateral: 19 (251); and trilateral 13 (1214). M:F ratio 1.4:1. Average lag time from initial symptoms to diagnosis was 12 months (1 46). Reasons for delay include financial constraints (N=67, 56%), ignorance of disease (N=27; 23%), (N=4; 3%). Only 16 % (N=19) of patients came from Metro Manila, with most 40% (N=47) from Southern Luzon (16,700 km2 area). Chief Majority had extraocular disease (50%) with International Retinoblastoma Staging System Stage 0: N=1; Stage 1: N=45; Stage II: 4: N=24; and unknown: N=13. Conclusions: To address delayed diagnosis and low detection rates, a nationwide educational campaign should tackle both the early warning signs of retinoblastoma and the availability of government financial aid, including the national health insurance coverage for enucleation, chemotherapy and radiation. A patient referral system from communities and local hospitals to retinoblastoma treatment centers should be established. P-229 Impact of Simple Lifestyle Intervention Yoga/Meditation on Improvement in the Quality of Life and Semen Quality in Fathers of Children Affected with Retinoblastoma S. Bisht 1 1All India Institute of Medical Sciences, ANATOMY, New Delhi, India Background/Objectives: Retinoblastoma (RB) is the most common childhood intraocular malignancy and its incidences has increased by 30% in the past 5 years which is believed to be due to the effect of environmental factors causing oxidative stress (OS). Sperm DNA integrity is essential for fertilization, proper embryonic development and birth of healthy offspring. Sperm is highly vulnerable to oxidative damage to both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA due to minimal cytosolic antioxidants and deficient DNA damage repair mechanism. Yoga/meditation are being increasingly used as adjunct to modern medicine in treatment of several clinical conditions. In the present study, we analyzed the effects of yoga/meditation on seminal OS and sperm DNA integrity in fathers of children affected with RB. Design/Methods: A total of 50 men were recruited for the study. Semen samples were collected at base line (day 0), 1 month, 3 months and after 6 months of yoga/meditation intervention. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), DNA fragmentation index (DFI) and 8hydroxy2'deoxyguanosine (8OHdG) levels were estimated at day 0, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months. Results: There was reduction in mean DFI levels at 1 month (p=0.63), 3 months (p=0.046) and 6 months (p=0.032), seminal mean ROS levels at 1 month (p=0.74), 3 months (p=0.039) and 6 months (p=0.006), 8OHdG levels at 1 month (p=0.68), 3 months (p=0.043) and 6 months (p=0.022) with respect to the base line levels (day 0) of yoga/meditation intervention. Conclusions: Yoga/meditation may significantly lower OS and oxidative DNA damage, and levels of mutagenic base 8OHdG in the sperm DNA. Thus yoga/meditation are simple lifestyle interventions which are therapeutic for maintaining/restoring sperm DNA integrity and hence, can reduce the prevalence of childhood cancers where poor sperm DNA integrity could be one of the reason. P-230 \"Where does this Come From?\" Understanding How Survivors and Parents of Children with Retinoblastoma Conceptualize Genetics H. Dimaras 1, A. Gedleh1, A. Lee1, L. Njambi3 1Hospital Sick Children, Ophthalmology 2Kikuyu Eye Unit, Ophthalmology, Kenya; 3The University Ophthalmology, Nairobi, Kenya Background/Objectives: Genetic testing and counselling have become integral parts in the management of heritable cancers, like the childhood eye cancer retinoblastoma. This study aimed to determine the attitudes, knowledge and experiences concerning retinoblastoma genetics among survivors and parents of children with retinoblastoma in Canada and Kenya. Design/Methods: Data was collected through focus groups and a brief demographic questionnaire. Study settings were in Canada (The Hospital for Sick Children) and Kenya (Kenyatta National Hospital and Kikuyu Eye Unit). Thematic analysis was used to identify key themes from discussions in each setting. Results: Three focus groups were conducted in Toronto (n = 15) and five in Kenya (n = 31). Themes that were common to both Canadian and Kenyan populations included: (a) there is significant confusion about the genetics and heritability of retinoblastoma; (b) there is a need for improved communication from healthcare teams about genetics; and (c) there is a need for improved access to psychosocial support to help with coping. Unique themes included: (a) genetic diagnosis can cause significant interruption to family relationships (Kenya); and (b) genetic testing and counselling are valued by families (Canada). Conclusions: Even in Canada, where genetic testing and counselling are well established, retinoblastoma survivors and parents were found to have significant gaps in their knowledge of genetics. Similarly in Kenya, participants were confused about the genetics and heritability of retinoblastoma. Improving communication from healthcare teams, and providing psychosocial support, could help enhance information uptake and understanding by families in both Canada and Kenya. The patient perspective from each population also revealed contextspecific issues that are useful for the refinement of cancer genetic services in each setting. P-231 Enhancing Communication about Retinoblastoma Clinical Encounters Using a Novel Global Data Repository B. Gallie 1, K. Houghham1, T. Truong2, L. Gavrylyuk2, C. Zhang3 1The Hospital for Sick Children, Ophthalmology and Vision Science, Toronto, Canada; 2Techna Institute University Health Network, Health Informatics Research, Toronto, Canada; 3Beijing Children's Hospital, Ophthalmology, Beijing, China Background/Objectives: Communication plays a critical role in effective retinoblastoma care. Yet communication of details from clinical encounters to all members of a patient's circle of care (individuals that provide or support retinoblastoma patient care including parents / legal guardians) remains complex and onerous. Despite best intentions, poor communication (i) wastes time and money, (ii) results in misunderstandings about the retinoblastoma treatments and prognosis, and (iii) contributes to family stress in the face of devastating diagnoses and difficult choices. Design/Methods: We set out to develop an innovative IT solution to enhance retinoblastoma circle of care communication. The prototype pointofcare retinoblastoma data repository, developed by 2005, has been tested extensively by care providers and iteratively refined for more than a decade at SickKids. We showed in 2009, 2015 that the cornerstone of this database, a languageindependent timeline, enhances understanding by parents of children with retinoblastoma concerning purposes and quality of care. Results: The Internet version of the repository, now called Diseasespecific electronic Patient Illustrated Clinical Timeline for R etino B lastoma (DePICTRB), is ready for global deployment. With consent, at diagnosis a new retinoblastoma patient is given a DePICTRB account by their treatment centre. Identifiable diseasespecific summary data about each clinical encounter is entered at the point of care, into the patient's DePICTRB account on a secure Telus server. Included in DePICTRB are drawings mapping the tumours and treatments in each eye, selected images key to understanding and cancer prognostic staging based on algorithms. \"Write access\" is securely assigned to clinical members of the circle of care; parents and others have \"read access\", supporting effective dialogue with caregivers. Conclusions: Anecdotal feedback suggests that DePICTRB enhances communication. By modulating communication within retinoblastoma circles of care, DePICTRBhas potential to reduce waste, improve understanding of the retinoblastoma treatment course and empower parents/legal guardians to be informed decision makers. P-232 The Canadian Retinoblastoma Research Registry K. Hougham 1, H. Dimaras1, C. Moses1 1The Hospital for Sick Children, Ophthalmology and Vision Sciences, Toronto, Canada Background/Objectives: Retinoblastoma is an aggressive childhood eye cancer. Retinoblastoma patients (individuals affected by retinoblastoma, including parents/legal guardians) indicate they are deeply incentivized to keep abreast of research and help cocreate it. Design/Methods: We initiated the Canadian Retinoblastoma Patient Engagement Strategy, in response to the keen interest of the patient community to be involved in research. As part of this strategy, we created the Canadian Retinoblastoma Research eRegistry. The purpose of the eRegistry is to engage Canadian retinoblastoma patients with the research community. Registrants are invited to give permission to (Part A - Passive Participation) receive general information about retinoblastoma (e.g., lay summaries); and (Part B - Active Participation) be contacted about specific research studies for which they (or their children) might be a suitable subject or team member (e.g., research assistant). Results: Since it launched (November, 2016), 35 people have agreed to participate in the Canadian Retinoblastoma Research Registry. All registrants enrolled in Parts A and B of the registry. Thirtyseven percent (n = 13) of the registrants are retinoblastoma survivors and 74% (n=26) of the registrants are the parent/legal guardian of someone diagnosed with retinoblastoma. All of the registrants are 30 years of age and older. Fortyfive percent (n =16) of the registrants are from large urban centers. As part of enrollment, registrants are invited to share research topics of interest. A quarter (n = 9) of the registrants provided suggested research topic(s), including second cancers, genetics and psychological side effects. Conclusions: These initial data indicate: (i) registrants are keen to receive both general information as well as invitations for specific research studies; (ii) targeted recruitment efforts may be required to reach younger people affected by retinoblastoma and retinoblastoma survivors; and (iii) although interested in retinoblastoma research, some retinoblastoma patients do not have specific research priorities. P-233 Development of Beagle Retinoblastoma Model: Mimicking Tumor Microenvironment Medicine, Department of Ophthalmology, Seoul, Republic of Korea; 2Seoul National University Hospital, Fight against AngiogenesisRelated Blindness FARB Laboratory Clinical Research Institute, Seoul, Republic of Korea Background/Objectives: This study aims to develop a novel orthotopic transplantation model of retinoblastoma model in beagles which mimics vitreous seeds. In patients with retinoblastoma, there is no definite method to investigate the characteristics of vitreous seeds because biopsy is absolutely prohibited. Design/Methods: SNUOTRb1 and Y79 cells (2 x 107 cells) from 2 different retinoblastoma cell lines were intravitreally injected into the eyes of beagles. At 6 weeks after the injection, the enucleated eyes were processed for further analyses. Retinoblastoma cells isolated from the vitreous cavity were evaluated for proliferation and characteristics as retinoblastoma cells. Furthermore, RNA sequencing was performed to investigate the overall patterns of gene expression in retinoblastoma cells isolated from the vitreous cavity. Results: At 6 weeks after the injection of retinoblastoma cells, the clumps of retinoblastoma cells were observed in the vitreous cavity of beagles. The isolated cells from the clumps demonstrated similar shapes to their parental cells and the viability was over 98%. Further analyses also showed that isolated cells possessed their characteristics as retinoblastoma cells. In addition, differentially expressed genes which could be valuable therapeutic targets were identified by comparison of gene expression between retinoblastoma cells isolated from the vitreous cavity and their parental cells. Conclusions: This beagle retinoblastoma model mimics vitreous seeds in patients with retinoblastoma. Because there is no method to identify the characteristics of vitreous seeds, this model will be valuable to investigate them. P-234 Mitochondrial Complex V (ATP 6 and ATP 8) in Retinoblastoma Tumor and ITS Association with Clinicopathological Parameters S. Kashyap 1, L. Singh1, M. S. Sen1, B. Chawla3, R. Meel3 1All Institute of Medical Sciences, Ocular Pathology, Delhi, India; 2AII India Institute of Medical Sciences, Ocular pathology, New delhi, India; 3All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Ophthalmology, Delhi, India Background/Objectives: Mitochondrial defects play an important role in the development and progression of cancer. Genetic defects of OXPHOS have been recognized as an important cause of human disease. The objective of this study is to elucidate the role of ATP 6 and ATP 8 proteins and its prognostic significance in retinoblastoma (Rb). Design/Methods: Immunohistochemistry was performed with primary antibodies against ATP 6 and ATP 8 on 45 formalinfixed retinoblastoma tissues and their expression were confirmed by western blotting on fresh tissues. Expression were then correlated with clinical, histopathological parameters and tumor staging. Results: ATP6 and ATP8 proteins were expressed in 35% and 45% cases of primary retinoblastoma cases by immunohistochemistry. Histopathological high risk factors including massive choroidal invasion, scleral invasion and optic nerve cut end were identified in 42.2% cases. Expression of ATP 6 and ATP 8 were statistically significant with various histopathological high risk factors and tumor invasion (>1 HRFs)(p<0.05). Conclusions: This is the first study predicting a relevant role of ATP 6 and ATP 8 protein and might be used as a therapeutic marker in retinoblastoma. This may be used as an attractive future anticancer target in primary retinoblastoma tumors. P-235 Changing Strategies in the Approach to Treatment of Bilateral Retinoblastoma, Demographics, Genetics, Outcome: 26Years Experience R. Kebudi 1, S. Tuncer2, S. Oncology Institute, Pediatric HematologyOncology, Istanbul, Turkey; 2Istanbul University Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, Department Ophthalmology Ocular Oncology Service, ISTANBUL, HematologyOncology, Istanbul, Turkey; 4Istanbul University Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, Department of Radiology, ISTANBUL, Turkey; 5Istanbul University Oncology Institute, Cancer Genetics, Istanbul, 6Istanbul University Oncology Institute, Radiation Oncology, Istanbul, Turkey Background/Objectives: Treatment decision in bilateral retinoblastomas (BRB) depends on tumor burden, potential for vision, status of the contralateral eye. Ocular salvage and late effects are important issues. This study evaluates demographic features, genetics, treatment modalities, late effects in BRB. Design/Methods: Patients with BRB treated in the Istanbul University, Oncology Institute and Opthalmology Department between 19902016 were retrospectively assessed. All patients were multidisciplinarily evaluated intraarterial, intravitreal CT was used. Genetic testing was done by Sanger DNA sequencing and MLPA analysis. Results: 114 BRB (56 male, 58 female) (228 eyes) with a median age of 9 months (0,542) were evaluated. Three had extraocular disease, two trilateral RB. Seventeen had a family history of retinoblastoma. The kind of mutations most observed were nonsense, frameshift, splice site. According to ICRB classification, 67 eyes were in group E, 43 group D, 27 group C, 45 group B, and 19 group A. Enucleation was done in 68 eyes, mostly group E. Radiotherapy was used for 30 eyes, most before 2000. Bonesoft tissue deformities, cataracts were observed in irradiated patients. Five developed a second cancer (4 sarcomas, 1 meningioma) at a median of 11 years, four in irradiated sites. The 5 yr survival was 93.5%. Conclusions: Chemoreduction (systemic, intraarterial) and local ophtalmic therapies enable preservation of vision in most group A, B, C tumors and some D tumors. Most group E tumors require enucleation. Radiotherapy can be avoided in most cases. Intraarterial chemotherapy is promising in maintaining ocular salvage. Patients should be followed up for late effects, genetic counseling should be done. The genetic work was supported by Scientific Research Projects Coordination Unit, Istanbul University, Project numbers BYP20546/2016 and 23070\". P-236 Intraarterial Chemotherapy (IAC) for Patients with Retinoblastoma (RB) Treated in One Center B. DembowskaBaginska 1, O. RutynowskaPronicka1, A. KolodziejczykGietka1, K. Cieslik2, Health Institute, Radiology, Warsaw, Poland Background/Objectives: Intraarterial chemotherapy for retinoblastoma is accepted as an effective treatment method. Since 2015 this method has been introduced in our center. Aim: to present tumor control and complications following IAC for Retinoblastoma. Design/Methods: Material and methods: 37 patients with intraocular RB (unilateral 29, bilateral8) were treated with IAC, 4 as primary treatment and 33 after systemic chemotherapy. In general all patients with bilateral disease and group E unilateral disease received systemic chemotherapy prior IAC. Patients who did not achieve complete tumor control after both treatments underwent laser therapy and intravitrous melphalan injections when needed. A total of 43 eyes were treated. IAC consisted of melphalan as a single agent or with topotecan or carboplatin. Doses of drugs were determined by the patients' age and angioanatomy. Success of treatment was defined as tumor inactivation and ocular survival. Results: Results; catherization was successful in 90% of procedures. There were 122 injections of chemotherapy (melphalan alone 17, with topotecan 13, with topotecan and carboplatin 89, topotecan and carboplatin 3). Each eye received a median of 3 intaarterial chemotherapy courses. Eye preservation was feasible in 41 out of 43 eyes. There were no hematological toxicities. One cerebro vascular event and 3 episodes of optic neuritis were observed. One patient with tumor progression on systemic chemotherapy and IAC developed distant metastases. Conclusions: Conclusions IAC allowed eye globe preservation in our RB patients' series. P-237 Retinoblastoma: A Curable Childhood Malignancy Experience in a Tertiary Care Hospital of Bangladesh B. Mamtaz 1, J. Islam2, F. Begum1, S. karim3 1National hospital, Paediatric Oncology, Dhaka, Bangladesh; 2National institute of cancer Dhaka, Bangladesh; 3Bangabandhu Sheikh Dhaka, Bangladesh Background/Objectives: Retinoblastoma (RB) is the most common intraocular malignancy of childhood. It accounts for 3% of all childhood malignancies and 11% of malignancies develop in the first year of life. RB is curable if diagnosed early and treated appropriately. But in Bangladesh many children with RB die due to delayed diagnosis and treatment. National Institute of Cancer Research and Hospital (NICRH) is the only tertiary care specialized cancer hospital in government sector in Bangladesh. Most of the children with RB are referred here for management from all parts of the country.The aims of the study were to see the prevalence of RB among the children attended the out patient department of Paediatric Oncology of NICRH and also the proportion of patients those were able to take treatment. Design/Methods: It was an observational study conducted from January 2008 to December 2016 in Paediatric Oncology Department of NICRH, Mohakhali, Dhaka, Bangladesh. Children with RB, age less than18 yrs of both sexes were included in the study. Data were collected from patients' registry. Results: Total patients attended the outpatient department of Pediatric Oncology during the study period were 2,687 and among them 537 (20%) were cases of RB. Male were 66%, female were 34% and most common age group was 1.5 to 3.0 years. Unilateral cases were 422(79%) and Bilateral were 115(21%). Only 236 (43% ) patient of RB took treatment. Most (95%) of attended children with RB were in advanced stage. Conclusions: Awareness about the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of RB is very important. This awareness can save valuable lives as well as vision of many children. P-238 Sunlight Exposure Prior to Diagnosis of Sporadic Retinoblastoma, Risk and Extent of Intraocular Disease M. OrjuelaGrimm 1, M. Ram\u00edrezOrtiz2, A. MedinaSanson3, PonceCasta\u00f1eda7 1Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, Epidemiology & Pediatric Oncology, New York, USA; Biostatistics, 5Hospital de Mexico, Pathology, Mexico CityDF, Mexico; 6Columbia University Mailman School of Public Background/Objectives: Retinoblastoma is one of few pediatric malignancies whose incidence varies geographically. Prior ecologic studies suggested that UV exposure through sunlight might contribute to increased incidence, though individual level exposure was never examined. Previously sunlight in infancy was recommended to prevent Vitamin D (VitD) deficiency. Rodent models of retinoblastoma suggest VitD inhibits angiogenesis. Design/Methods: In EpiRbMx, mothers of children with retinoblastoma are interviewed at diagnosis and report their child's daily & weekly sunlight exposure during 3 age periods (06 months, 6.112 months, 12.123 months). We examined whether duration of sunlight exposure varied between 216 unilateral and 101 bilateral retinoblastoma cases,and 152 similarly aged healthy controls. In 158 unilateral ('unilaterals') and 75 bilateral ('bilaterals') cases we examined whether extent of disease varied with reported duration of sun exposure ('sun'). Results: Sun increased with age in cases and controls. Within each age group, cases had less sun than controls. Greater maternal education was associated with less sun, particularly after age 6 months (p<0.05). Controlling for maternal education, cases had less sun than controls. Compared with controls, Unilaterals had less sun at each age (p<.05), while Bilaterals had less sun after age 12 months (p<.0001), and at earlier ages (p=0.08). Controlling for maternal education, unilaterals had more sun than bilaterals, especially at age >12 months (p<0.01). In unilaterals, maternal education was inversely associated with International Intraocular Retinoblastoma Classification (IIRC), and St. Jude stage, and Sun. Sun was positively associated with IIRC in unilaterals >12 months (p=0.03), though less so after adjusting for maternal education (p=0.06); there was no association with St Jude stage. In bilaterals, sun was unrelated to extent of intra or extraocular disease. Conclusions: In central Mexico, sun exposure is inversely associated with incidence of retinoblastoma. In unilateral retinoblastoma, sun exposure in the 2nd year of life appears positively associated with extent of intraocular disease. P-239 ClinicalEpidemiological Characteristics of Bilateral Retinoblastoma in Children at the Edgardo Rebagliati Martins Hospital (HNERM) and Oncosalud Clinic in 19992016 C. alvarez G. hospital, lima, Peru Background/Objectives: Bilateral Retinoblastoma: current multimodal treatment reduces the tumor to the maximum and prevents blindness. Design/Methods: Descriptive, retrospective study of children with bilateral retinoblastoma Rebagliati HospitalOncosalud Clinic. Results: Twentyfive cases in a population of 3263 oncological children of Rebagliti Hospital and 30,000 early detection cancer children program in Oncosalud Clinic. Mean age was 16.8 months ( newborn - fortyeigth months ), Male / Female sex ratio 1.08, boys thirteen and twelve girls. Preschool 52%, infants 44% and schoolers 4%. One case with family history of bilateral Retinoblastoma and RB1 gene (+). Clinical: leukocoria metastasis: bone marrow; brain and a sphenoid case and cervical nodes. International stage of the right eye: A (4%), D (44%), E (52%) and and (12%), IV (8%), V (76%). Enucleation at debut was in 3 cases (12.5%), and 24 cases (96%) received systemic chemotherapy. From 2003 onwards, focal therapy was added, preserving unilateral vision in 11 (44%) of 25 cases, of whom 10 (90.9%) received chemotherapy more focal therapy (four cryotherapy (16%), three received laser (12%);one received brachytherapy one intraarterial chemotherapy melphalan); one thermotherapy alone (9.09%). At the time of this report, twenty one cases in remission (84%) and four deaths (16%) due to denial of bilateral enucleation by persistent postsystemic chemotherapy. Overall survival of 104.29 months and disease free survival of 119.25 months. Conclusions: Bilateral Retinoblastoma was more prevalent in preschoolers and males, leukocoria was the most frequent sign. The introduction of focal treatment from 2003 together with surgery and systemic chemotherapy has helped to preserve vision in the less compromised eye, avoiding blindness. P-240 Efficacy of Intrathecal Topotecan in Patients with Advanced Retinoblastoma. Preliminary Report C. Leal1, A. Perez1, H. Pena 1 1Instituto Nacional de Pediatr\u00eda, Oncology, Mexico City, Mexico Background/Objectives: Retinoblastoma (Rb) is the most commun intraocular neoplasia, with high mortality in advanced disease. Topotecan is a topoisomerase I with antitumor activity against a variety of adult and childhood solid tumors. The CSF penetration of the active lactone form of topotecan and no significant neurologic toxicity was observed. To determine the efficacy of intrathecal topotecan in patients with advanced Rb. Design/Methods: Patients newly diagnosed for orbitary and CNS metastatic Rb were enrolled in this study. Treatment was based on ifosfamide 1.8grm2scdose/5 days, etoposide 100mgm2scdose/5 days and carboplatin (AUC 6 1) each 21 days concomitant with intrathecal topotecan (0.4mg/dose) administered twice weekly during the 6 cycles of intense chemotherapy. Results: We enrolled 6 patients with unilateral extraocular Rb with mean age of 32 months, with a metastasic CNS disease by cerebral magnetic resonance (MR) in 3 of them and nonmetastatic patient with advanced orbital disease. 2 patients were found to have positive CFS for neoplasic cells, achieving CSF response (negativization on patology study) after one and two cycles with intrathecal topotecan and chemotherapy. All were submitted to enucleation after 2 cycles of treatment. 2 patients (33%) presented progression to CNS confirmed by MRI, both died with tumor activity. Four of them are free of disease mesured clinically and by imagen and CSF. No one presented any sign of neurological toxicity. One patient presented hematological and infectious grade IV toxicity. Conclusions: Remission of the disease was achieved in four patients, without severe or irreversible adverse events. Complete response, measured by imaging and CSF negativization, were confirmed after two cycles of treatment. Topotecan must be evaluated in a large study to prove the efficacy. P-241 Associations of RB1 Genetic Variants with Clinical Traits in Retinoblastoma Patients from a Brazilian Service (INCA Rio de Janeiro) B. Pinto Nasr 1, M.C. Silva de Miranda Gomes1, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; 2Universidade do Grande Gafr\u00e9eGuinle HUGG, Estimate frequency of variants in RB1 gene and test associations with different clinical traits in patients with Retinoblastoma (RB). Design/Methods: Retrospective chart review of 206 patients was performed. We reviewed three continuous traits - age of diagnosis (DX), age of first symptom (1S), lagtime between 1S and DX (LAG) - and the categorical traits: laterality, survival, family history, intra/extraocular tumors, treatment, secondary tumors. We performed complete Sanger sequencing and Multiplex Ligationdependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) of RB1 gene from blood samples of 127 patients. RB1 molecular diagnosis was defined as Positive or Inconclusive. To test effects of RB1 molecular diagnosis, laterality and survival on square root (SQRT) of each continuous trait we used threeway ANOVA. Chisquare tests were used to test associations between pairs of categorical traits Results: ANOVA of SQRT age data showed patients with bilateral RB have significant earlier diagnosis (DX = 11.5m \u00b1 0.3) and first symptom (1S = 4.7m \u00b1 0.3) than unilateral (DX = 26.4m \u00b1 0.2; 1S = 15.7m \u00b1 0.4); P < 0.01. Patients with pathogenic variants presented earlier DX average (11.0m \u00b1 0.3) than inconclusive ones (23.2m \u00b1 0.3); P < 0.05. Significant effect of survival was found for LAG time (P < 0.01), which deceased patients had greater LAG average (10.3m \u00b1 0.4) than living/nondetermined (4.7m \u00b1 0.1). Chisquare tests were nonsignificant for all pairs of categorical traits (alpha = 0.01), except for: RB1 molecular diagnosis (M) \u00d7 laterality; M \u00d7 of RB; survival \u00d7 intra/extraocular tumors. Pathogenic variants were associated with higher frequency of bilateral (31) than unilateral (18). Most frequent types of pathogenic RB1 variants were nonsense (20) and splicing (9). All patients with splicing variants had bilateral tumors. Conclusions: Frequencies of RB1 variants were similar to literature. A possible trend which patients with splicing variants develop bilateral RB was detected. P-242 Retinoblastoma Screening Practices Among Physicians in Botswana H. Reed 1, P. Mehta1, J. Slone1 1Baylor College of Medicine, Pediatrics, Houston, USA Background/Objectives: Retinoblastoma is a rare but highly treatable childhood malignancy with cure rates >90% in highincome countries. Since 2007, the sole childhood cancer treatment center in Botswana, located at Princess Marina Hospital (PMH) in Gaborone, has been operated by Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Centers. PMH records indicate that 16 patients were diagnosed with retinoblastoma with only 10 (62.5%) surviving despite the availability of many appropriate treatment options. The study assessed retinoblastoma screening practices among physicians in Botswana in order to identify opportunities for improving early detection. Design/Methods: A questionnaire assessing demographics, retinoblastoma screening knowledge, and barriers to performing the red reflex exam was distributed to physicians practicing in Botswana using REDCap online datacapture software. Results: Thirtysix of 266 physicians submitted responses. Pediatricians were more likely than nonpediatricians to correctly identify the red reflex exam technique (odds ratio (OR)=6.0, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.034.8, p=0.029) and to report being very confident in performing the red reflex exam (OR=11.3, CI=1.968.1, p=0.003). Only 6 respondents reported performing the red reflex exam all/most of the time in children <6 years. More than half of respondents reported having access to a working ophthalmoscope only some of the time or never. Physicians working in the private/mission sector were more likely than Ministry of Health (MOH) physicians to have reliable access to a working ophthalmoscope (OR=6.6, CI=1.139.3, p=0.026). The most frequently selfreported barriers to performing the red reflex exam included time constraints, no access to an ophthalmoscope, and no training/lack of confidence in performing the red reflex exam. Conclusions: Although the disparity in survival is likely multifactorial, improved screening may lead to better outcomes by increasing early detection. Multiple opportunities for intervention to improve retinoblastoma screening in Botswana were identified, including physician education, particularly among nonpediatricians with pediatric patients, and access to ophthalmoscopes among MOH physicians. P-243 First Prospective National Registry for Pediatric Eye Cancer in Germany and Austria M. Reschke 1, M. Borowski2, S. Johannes3, P. P. 1University Hematology Oncology, Essen, Germany; 2University of and Clinical Research, Muenster, Germany; 3Charit\u00e9University Hospital Berlin, Department Pediatric Hematology and Berlin, Germany; 4University Essen, Department of Radiotherapy, Essen, Germany; 6University Hospital Essen, Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology and Neuroradiology, Essen, Germany; 7University Hospital Essen, Department of Ophthalmology, Essen, Germany; 8University Hospital Essen, Institute of Human Genetics, Essen, Germany Background/Objectives: Retinoblastoma is the most frequent malignant, intraocular tumor in childhood. Five year overall survival rate is high in developed countries; however, secondary primary malignancies and compromised vision still complicate followup. Clinical trials and multicenter prospective data are rare. Design/Methods: RBregistry is a prospective multicenter observational clinical study for patients with newly diagnosed pediatric eye cancer in Germany and Austria. It collects data about the results of genetic analysis, stage of disease at first diagnosis (TNM, IRSS and ICRB staging systems), choice of therapy and outcome. Reference evaluations for neuroradiology, genetics, cytology, radiotherapy, and histopathology were established to improve the comparability of the investigations performed at different participating centers. Results: The recruitment rate exceeded the expected registration. In 3 years, 154 patients with 146 retinoblastoma (91 unilateral, 52 bilateral), three uveal melanomas, two medulloepithelioma of the ciliary body, two retinal astrocytoma, and one heritable retinoblastoma predisposition with nonpenetrance for retinoblastoma were included. In total, 193 eyes were affected by retinoblastoma. Most frequent ICRB group was E (n=66, 34.2%), and most frequent IRSS were 44.1%) and I primarily enucleated (n=59, 90.8%), whereas all 16 ICRB A eyes were treated focally. Overall eye survival remained at 48.2% after 16 months and was associated with ICRB grouping (p<0.001, logrank test); 100 of 193 eyes were enucleated. Conclusions: RB registry is a wellestablished clinical registry appropriate to improve patient counseling and to provide a basis for the development of interventional clinical trials. In the longterm, the data will help to improve therapy protocols and thus conserve vision, reduce late term side effects, and increase quality of life. P-244 Histopathologic Risk Characteristics of Retinoblastoma After Secondary Enucleation in Patients Undergoing OrganSaving Treatment T. Ushakova1, Y. Serov 1, O. Gorovtsova1, oncology and heamatology N.N. Blokhin Russian Cancer R, HEAD AND NECK TUMORS, Moscow, Russia; 2SRI of clinical and experimental radiology of N. N. Blokhin Cancer Research Center, laboratory of interventional radiology, Moscow, oncology of N. N. Blokhin Cancer Research Center, pathology, Moscow, Russia Background/Objectives: The development of metastasis in retinoblastoma (RB) depends on histopathologic risk characteristics such as tumor invasion of the optic nerve with retrolaminar proliferation, massive invasion of choroid, sclera and structures of anterior chamber. To demonstrate histopatholgic features of retinoblastoma eyes enucleated after organsaving treatment, including intraarterial melphalan with special focus the type of tumor recurrence if present. Design/Methods: From 01.2011 to 10.2016, 16 eyes (16 patients) were enucleated after prior combined organsaving treatment, including selective intraarterial chemotherapy at our institute. Results: 10 of 16 eyes had insufficiency or minimum tumor invasion choroid and/or prelaminar invasion of the optic nerve and/or massive vitreous tumor spread. The adjuvant therapy was not administrated for patients of this group. 4 of 16 eyes had massive tumor invasion choroid and/or including anterior segment and/or a beginning optic nerve of the eye. The second line of chemotherapy was administrated for patients of this group. 2 of 16 eyes had a type IV regression. These eyes were enucleated in connection with the development of secondary complications as glaucoma, hemophthalmus and subatrophy of eye. So far none of our patients developed metastatic disease. Conclusions: The most common reason for secondary enucleation of the eye was intraocular tumor progression, including anterior segment of the eye. Recurrent tumors in 4 cases with massive tumor invasion choroid and/or including anterior segment and/or a beginning optic nerve of the eye had the potential risk to develop metastatic disease. P-245 Long Term Follow Up of Retinoblastoma Survivors: Experience from India R. Seth 1, A. Singh1, V. Guru1, B. Chawla2, S. Pathy3, S. Sapra1 1ALl India Institute of Medical Sciences, Pediatrics, Delhi, India; 2ALl India Institute of Medical Sciences, Ophthalmology, Delhi, India; 3ALl India Institute of Medical Sciences, Radiation Oncology, Delhi, India Background/Objectives: Retinoblastoma (Rb) is the most common primary intraocular tumor of infancy and childhood. Survivors' ocular and visual problems and increased risk for subsequent malignancy are well documented but data on long term health status of Rb survivors are limited: this being particularly true for India Design/Methods: Children who had completed treatment for retinoblastoma at least 2 years ago before and were under follow up at the after cancer treatment clinic were evaluated. Results: In our series of 213 patients, the median age was 29 months, there was a male preponderance, and majority had unilateral disease. Enucleation was done in almost three fourth and 3% underwent bilateral enucleation. Majority of the patients received chemotherapy, and few received radiation.. Growth was affected in about one third and majority were those who had received radiation. Diminished vision was noticed in about onesixth. Orbital hypoplasia and contracted socket was seen in 14.1% cases. 2.7% were hearing impaired. About onesixth had a global intelligence delay. Second neoplasms were seen in 0.01%. No other abnormalities seen. Conclusions: Common late effects in our Rb survivors include diminished vision in the salvage eye,Intellectual disability and contracted socket; there is a need for timely institution of prosthesis to avoid late effects like hypoplasia, contracted sockets and better cosmesis and enhanced self esteem. Second neoplasm is a concern. Lifelong follow up and counseling of a healthy lifestyle is needed for Rb survivors. P-246 Expression Pattern of Immune Checkpoints PD1 and PDL1 in Retinoblastoma and ITS Prognostic Significance L. Singh 1, S. Kashyap2, 1Jamia Millia Biosciences, Delhi, India; 2All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Ocular Pathology, New Delhi, India; 3Jamia Millia Islamia, Biosciences, New Delhi, India Background/Objectives: Retinoblastoma (RB), malignant tumor of the sensory retina, is the most common eye cancer of childhood due to the defect of RB gene. The immune system plays an important role in controlling and eradicating cancer. Recent studies suggest that programmed death1/programmed death ligand (PD1/PDL1) pathway in Tcell activation plays a major role in tumor escape mechanism from host immunity. Therefore, we investigated the expression of PD1 and PDL1 in human retinoblastoma cancer to define their clinical significance in patient's prognosis after surgery. Design/Methods: PD1 and PDL1 protein expression was evaluated in 60 prospective cases of primary enucleated retinoblastoma specimens by immunohistochemistry and validated by western blotting. PD1 and PDL1 mRNA expression was investigated by quantitative real time PCR (qPCR). Expression of PD1 and PDL1 were then correlated with clinical, histopathological parameters and patient survival. Results: Immunohistochemistry showed cytoplasmic PD1 expression in (9/60) 15 % cases, whereas PDL1 showed nuclear expression in (31/60) 51.6% cases. Western blotting confirmed the immunoreactivity results on representative cases. The protein and the mRNA levels of determination by IHC and real time qPCR were closely correlated. Expression of PDL1 showed significant correlation with poor tumour differentiation and tumor invasion (p<0.05). There was a significant difference in the overall survival of patients with PDL1 expression. Conclusions: These data suggest that PDL1 expression may be a new biomarker for patients with retinoblastoma in tumor originating from sensory retinal cells. This study provides first data for the role of immune checkpoints in retinoblastoma patients. Further studies are necessary to confirm this observation and to evaluate the predictive value of PD1 and PDL1 in retinoblastoma in the context of PD1 inhibition. P-247 Correlation of p65/RelA Expression with Tumour Invasion in Primary Retinoblastoma M.K. Singh 1, S. Kashyap1, S. Sen1, N. Pushker2 1All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Ocular Pathology, Delhi, India; 2All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Ophthalmology, Delhi, India Background/Objectives: Retinoblastoma (Rb) is a malignant tumor of developing retina of children which occur before the age of five years. Nuclear factor kappa B (NFB) has been shown to play a role in cell proliferation, apoptosis, cytokine production, and oncogenesis. The nuclear factorB (NFB) transcription factors family is thought to play an important role in the development of certain cancers. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the localisation and expression of p65/RelA protein in retinoblastoma. Design/Methods: Prospective analysis of 55 primary retinoblastoma cases over a period of one year. Expression of RelA was analyzed by Immunohistochemistry (IHC) in formalin fixed retinoblastoma specimens. Their mRNA expressions were analyzed on 25 fresh primary enucleated retinoblastoma tissues by real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Results were then correlated with clinical and pathological parameters. Results: Expression of p65/RelA proteins was found to be 30% in retinoblastoma cases but not in normal retina. This protein was more frequently detected in poorlydifferentiated and invasive tumours than in welldifferentiated and noninvasive tumours. Increased expression of p65/RelA was statistically significant with choroidal invasion and invasive tumors (>1 HRFs). mRNA expressions of p65/RelA was found to be upregulated in 35% of cases. mRNA expressions were correlated well with immunostaining. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that expression of p65/RelA protein represent a reliable prognostic marker of retinoblastoma and might be related to retinoblastoma tumorigenesis and progression through a noncanonical pathway. Targeting NFB combined with other therapies may represent a novel approach to retinoblastoma. P-248 IntraArterial Melphalan and Topotecan Therapy for I. Akgoz3, C. Akyuz1 1Hacettepe University Oncology, Dept. of Pediatric Oncology, ANKARA, Turkey; 2Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Dept. of Ocular Oncology, Ankara, Turkey; 3Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Dept. of Radiology, Ankara, Turkey Background/Objectives: Retinoblastoma is the most common intraocular malignancy in children. Here we present our results of intraarterial chemotherapy (IAC) with melphalan and topotecan (IACMT) in the treatment of newly diagnosed or relapsedrefractory retinoblastoma patients. Design/Methods: In this study we retrospectively analysed the clinical features and outcomes of the 37 patients and 41 eyes treated with IACMT between October 2015 and February 2017. Tumor control and globe salvage with IACMT were analyzed. Complete blood counts were examined 7 and 15 days after the IACT for systemic toxicity. Results: The median age at diagnosis was 13 months (range 1101 months). There were 18 girls and 19 boys. Intraarterial chemotherapy with melphalan and topotecan was the primary treatment in 21 eyes and secondary in 20 eyes. The eyes who received IACMT as a firstline therapy were classified according to the International Classification of Retinoblastoma (ICRB) as group A (n = 2), B (n = 1), C (n =3), D (n = 14), or E (n = 2). After IAC with a mean followup of 6 months (range 216 months), complete regression was achieved for tumor in 22 eyes (53%). Four of 41 eyes were enucleated (10%), 1 from 21 firstline treated group and 3 from 20 secondline treated group. Globe salvage was achieved in 95% of primarytreated cases and in 85% of secondarytreated cases.The 1year enucleationfree survival rate was 70%. further treatment requirements after IACT were as follows: enucleation in 4 eyes, and local therapy in 11 eyes. No severe systemic side effect observed. Conclusions: Our preliminary results supported that globe salvage and avoidance of toxicity related with systemic chemotherapy may be achieved by IACMT. Given its safety and high efficacy, it is expected that IACMT will replace conventional strategies. P-249 Identification of RB1 Germline Mutations and the Inheritance Pattern of Retinoblastoma in Jordan Y. Yousef 1, M. Mehyar1, I. Nawaiseh1, I. Sultan2, R. Deebajah2, A. Tbakhi3 1King Cancer Center, Department of Surgery Ophthalmology, Amman, Jordan; 2King Hussein Cancer Center, Pediatric Oncology, Amman, Jordan; 3King Hussein Cancer Center, Cell Therapy and Applied Genomics, Amman, Jordan Background/Objectives: Retinoblastoma (RB) is a childhood cancer developing in the retina due to mutations in the RB1 gene. Herein we are trying to identify the oncogenic mutations in the RB1 gene and the inheritance pattern of RB in the Jordanian RB patients. Design/Methods: The peripheral blood of 50 Retinoblastoma patients was collected, and genomic DNA was extracted. DNA sequencing was conducted by Next Generation Sequencing analysis, multiplex PCR (QMPCR), and Allelespecific PCR. Results: In this cohort, 50 affected patients were studied. Twenty (40%) patients had unilateral RB, and 30(60%) had bilateral RB. Overall, 36(72%) patients had germline disease, 17(47%) of them had the same mutation detected in one of the parents (inherited disease). In the bilateral group, all (100%) patients had germline disease, and 13(43%) had inherited mutation, and in the unilateral group, 6(30%) had germline disease and 4(20%) had inherited mutation. Of interest, in the inherited cases, paternal mutation was seen in 88% of the affected patients. Only one (2%) of the patients had mosaic mutation detected, and in one(2%) of the inherited cases the mother had mosaic mutation. Over the 17 inherited cases, 16(94%) of them had unaffected carrier parent. Conclusions: Even all bilateral RB patients in our cohort had germline disease, 30% of unilateral disease were germline, and 47% of patients with germline disease had inherited disease from affected(6%) or unaffected carrier(94%). Therefore molecular screening is very important for the genetic counseling regarding the risk for inherited Retinoblastoma in both unilateral and bilateral cases. Solid Non Brain Tumours Liver Tumours P-250 Genomic Studies in Hepatoblastoma: and of Sao Paulo, Genetic, Sao Paulo, Brazil; 3A.C.CAMARGO CANCER CENTER, Pediatric Oncology, Sao Paulo, Brazil; 4A.C.CAMARGO CANCER CENTER, Pathology Department, Sao Paulo, Brazil; 5GRAACC, Pediatric Oncology, Sao Paulo, Brazil; 6A.C.CAMARGO CANCER Sao Paulo, Brazil Background/Objectives: Hepatoblastoma is the most common primary liver tumor in children, accounting for over 1% of pediatric cancers. Although molecular data on HB tumorigenesis is still scarce because of its rarity, recently new insights have been gained into their molecular biology. The main objective of this study was to investigate the mutational burden of HBs. Design/Methods: A wholeexome sequencing was performed in a discovery cohort of 6 HBs and their matched nontumoral liver tissues (244K Agilent SureSelect Enrichment). Bioinformatic analysis of exome data identified somatic variants in 69 genes which were chosen for validation using a target sequencing panel (SureSelectXT Target Enrichment System for Illumina PairedEnd Sequencing Library). The gene panel was composed of the detected 69 genes and other 48 genes related with HB or cancer, and it was used to investigated additional 13 HB samples as a validation group. To complement the screening of somatic mutations, we performed an arrayCGH analysis (Agilent 180K) in twelve HB samples to screen for copy number alterations. Results: A total of 71 somatic mutations were validated in 53 genes considering the entire HB group. The somatic analysis reveals pathogenic mutations in the CTNNB1 gene and a recurrent missense mutation in the CX3CL1 gene; the role of these mutations was explored by IHQ studies of their proteins as well as by gene expression analysis by RTPCR. ArrayCGH analysis showed mainly wholechromosome and chromosomearm aneuploidies, and a few focal aberrations could be also mapped. Conclusions: Our data highlighted a relatively stable tumoral genome in this type of pediatric liver tumor, which present a low mutational burden regarding potentially pathogenic mutations and a Potential Target for Liver Cancer A. D'Souza 1, L. Valanejad Keifer2, K. Timchenko2 1Cincinnati Children's Hospital and Blood Disease Institute, 45229, USA; 2Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Pediatric Surgery, Cincinnati, 3Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Gastroenterology, Cincinnati, USA Background/Objectives: One of the critical steps in development of hepatoblastoma (HBL) is the loss of control of proliferation of hepatocytes. Our examination of a large bank of HBL samples found that an oncogene Gankyrin is elevated in all examined HBL patients with high rate of proliferation. The goal of this project was to examine the role of Gankyrin in activation of liver proliferation. Design/Methods: To test the role of Gankyrin in liver proliferation, we generated liverspecific Gankyrin knockout mice (Gank LKO) and examined liver proliferation using two models: proliferation after surgery and after liver injury. Liver proliferation was monitored using a combination of approaches including measuring DNA replication, mitosis and expression of cell cycle genes and oncogenes. Immunostaining, QRTPCR and Western blotting assays were used. Results: Gank LKO mice had normal livers by gross examination and serum hepatic function testing. However, RNASeq analyses showed that Gank LKO mice have reduced expression of genes that are involved in liver regeneration and liver cancer. Consistent with these findings, we found that liver proliferation after partial hepatectomy (PH) is dramatically inhibited in Gank LKO mice. Looking for underlying mechanisms, we found that tumor suppressor proteins (TSPs) are reduced by Gankyrin in control mice after PH, but are elevated in Gank LKO mice. These elevated TSPs in Gank LKO mice inhibit liver proliferation. Similar inhibition of liver proliferation was observed in Gank LKO mice after liver injury mediated by carbon tetrachloride. Conclusions: Gankyrin is a powerful oncogene in HBL. Our study demonstrates that deletion of Gankyrin is sufficient to inhibit liver proliferation in animal models, which is an important mechanism behind carcinogenesis. These results strongly suggest that inhibitors of Gankyrin should be investigated as potential targeted therapy for HBL. P-252 Liver Transplantation for Hepatoblastoma B. DembowskaBagiska 1, Ismail2, Warsaw, Poland; 2The Children's Memorial Health Institute, Pediatric Surgery and Organ Transplantation, Warsaw, Poland; 3The Children's Memorial Health Institute, Patology, Warsaw, Poland Background/Objectives: Liver transplantation (LTX) has its established role in the treatment of children with hepatoblastoma. Aim; presentation of treatment results and complications of LTX for hepatoblastoma. Design/Methods: Between 2002 and 2017, 22 children underwent liver transplantation for unresectable hepatoblastoma. Age at transplantation ranged from 8/12 to 13 and 8/12 (median 2 and 2/12 years). There were 10 patients with POSTEXT III, 9 with POSTEXT IV. Six patients were stage IV disease, bilateral lung metastases. All patients received preoperative chemotherapy according to SIOPEL recommendations. All six patients had no evidence of metastatic disease before LTX. Twenty children received grafts from related donors, 2 cadaveric grafts. All patients received chemotherapy after transplantation (median 2 courses - cisplatin, vincristine, 5 FU). Results: 18 out of 22 patients are alive with a median followup of 3 years. Patients survival is 100%, 81,6 %, 61,2 % at 1, 5 and 10 years. Four patients died; one 10 years from LTX of bone marrow aplasia of unknown etiology, 3 patients from relapses refractory to chemotherapy 4, 7, 11 months from LTX. Relapses occurred in the lungs of 3 patients, in 1 of them bone metastases were also observed. Posttransplantation chemotherapy was well tolerated. One patient underwent 2 retransplantations 2 years then 1 month from primary and second LTX. Conclusions: Our data confirm that LTX is a treatment option for children with unresectable Hepatoblastoma. P-253 Characteristics and Outcome of Hepatoblastoma: Experience at the Instituto Nacional De Enfermedades Neoplasicas (INEN) Peru R. Diaz1, E. Ruiz2, Maradiegue1, Lima, Peru; 2Instituto Peru; 3Instituto of solid pediatric malignancies at the INEN. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical features and outcome of these patients between 1999 and 2014. Design/Methods: This is a retrospective and descriptive study. Between January 1999 and December 2014, 145 patients under 15 years of age were diagnosed having HB, 14 patients were excluded. Survival analysis was performed using KaplanMeier method. Results: The median age was 3.3 years (range 0.08 to 14 years), M/F ratio 2/1. Fifty patients (38.1%) had complete remission, 22 had progressive disease (16.7%). 49 patients recurred (37.4%) and 37 died (28.2%) Staging according to PRETEXT was: I 10.6% (14), II 38.9 %( 51), III 35.8 %(47), IV 10.6 %( 14). Nineteen patients (14.5%) had pulmonary metastases at diagnosis. The 5 year overall survival (OS) was 65.8% and Event Free Survival (EFS) 61%. OS in the nonmetastatic group was 71.9% and 42.8% in the metastatic group. The OS for Pretext I 90.9%, II 66.9%, III 57.6%, IV 38.1% OS according to initial treatment SIOPEL 79%, carboplatin/doxorubicin 64.1%, VCR/5FU/cisplatin 35% and 67.1% for those with initial surgery. The EFS for these patients was 60%, 56%, 25% and 62% respectively Conclusions: HB is not a rare tumor at our Institution and a multidisciplinary team approach is crucial for the improvement on survivorship. The lung metastases conditions a worse prognosis and there has been improved survival since 2008 with SIOPEL treatment. P-254 Epigenetic Mechanisms in Liver Tumors: Gene Expression Analysis of the Epigenetic Machinery in 1 1Institute of Biosciences University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Genetics and Evolutionary Biology, S\u00e2o Paulo, Brazil; 2AC Camargo Cancer Center, International Research Center, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil; 3AC Camargo Cancer Center, Department of Pathology, S\u00e3o Paulo, 4AC Camargo Cancer 5Pediatric Oncology Institute GRAACC Federal Paulo, Department of Pediatrics, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil; 6National Center for Research in Energy and Materials, CNPEM, Campinas, Brazil Background/Objectives: Liver tumors in children account for 14% of all pediatric solid tumors. While hepatocellular carcinoma is predominant in adults, the most common liver cancer in children is hepatoblastoma. Mechanisms underlying hepatoblastoma development are still poorly explored, and prognosis in advanced tumor stages remains poor. It is suggested that this embryonal tumor is associated with a blockage in hepatocyte differentiation. These tumors carry a low mutational burden, and the impairment of epigenetic mechanisms, which are the core of embryogenesis and development, stands out as an alternative route for tumorigenesis. The main objective of this study was to explore the role of genes associated with methylation and hydroxymethylation in hepatoblastomas. Design/Methods: The cohort of tumors consisted of 29 hepatoblastomas and a control group of 8 nontumoral liver tissues.The expression of genes 5hmC quantification assay (Quest 5hmC DNA ELISA Kit) was applied to assess the level of 5hmC in tumors compared to controls. Results: TET1 and TET2 genes were found to be upregulated in tumors. A significant increase in the 5hmC levels was also evident in hepatoblastoma samples when compared to nontumoral tissues. These data suggested that hepatoblastomas could present a pluripotency pattern of gene expression; to address this issue, the expression levels of three genes associated with pluripotency (POU5F1, SOX2 andNANOG) were evaluated, and no alteration was detected. Conclusions: The upregulation of DNA methylation genes, such as TETs, and an increased level of 5hmC, support the hypothesis that hepatoblastomas exhibit an epigenetic signature of immature cells, suggesting a blockage during hepatic cells differentiation in their genesis. However, the absence of pluripotency markers showed commitment with the differentiation process. Our hypothesis is that hepatoblastomas are in a transitional stage of hepatic differentiation, probably hepatoblasts. Funding: FAPESP; CAPES P-255 Development of Hepatoblastoma During Growth Hormone Therapy T. Oue 1, T. Sasaki1, M. Zenitani1, N. Tanaka1 1Hyogo College Of Medicine, Pediatric Surgery, Nishinomiyashi Hyogo, Japan Background/Objectives: Growth hormone (GH) is reported to affect tumor growth and increases the risk of neoplasia such as leukemia. However, the association between GH and hepatoblastoma (HB) has been rarely reported. Here we present two cases of HB that developed during GH therapy. Design/Methods: Patient medical records were collected and retrospectively reviewed. Results: Patient 1 was a 2yearold boy and patient 2 was a 13yearold boy. Both were administered with GH therapy for growth retardation due to poor GH secretion, as shown by tolerance tests. Abdominal distention of the right upper quadrant was observed 2 month and 2 years after GH therapy initiation in patients 1 and 2, respectively. Imaging studies including abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed a huge tumor in the left hepatic lobe, and serum alphafetoprotein was markedly elevated in both cases. GH therapy was discontinued and tumor biopsy was immediately performed to confirm the diagnosis of HB. The tumor was completely resected after several courses of chemotherapy using cisplatin and doxorubicin, according to the protocol of the Japan Pediatric Liver Tumor Study Group. After additional chemotherapy, the patients are alive without disease for 4 years and 1 year, respectively. GH secretions normalized and catchup growth was observed in both cases after the treatment of HB. Conclusions: In patient 1, as HB was noticed soon after the initiation of GH therapy, GH may have accelerated the growth of an already present HB. In patient 2, HB developed during the 2 years of GH therapy; therefore, GH may have initiated HB tumorigenesis. In both cases, GH therapy was immediately discontinued because GH likely accelerated tumor growth. Normalized GH secretion after tumor resection may indicate that HB tumors secrete a type of GH antagonist. P-256 What is the Role of Aneuploidy in Embryonal Cytogenomic Analysis of A. Krepischi1 1Institute of Biosciences University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Genetics and Evolutionary Biology, S\u00e2o Paulo, Brazil; 2AC Camargo Cancer C\u00e2ncer Infantil Department Paulo University Medical School, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil Background/Objectives: Cytogenetic alterations leading to changes in chromosome copy number (aneuploidy) are hallmarks of cancer cells. Hepatoblastoma (HB) is an uncommon embryonal liver tumor accounting for approximately 80% of childhood hepatic cancer and is mostly diagnosed in children under the age of 18 months. Currently, there are no validated prognostic or therapeutic biomarkers for HB patients. Most HBs are sporadic cases, although its incidence is elevated in certain genetic syndromes, including Beckwith-Wiedemann and familial adenomatous polyposis. To explore the cytogenomic profile of HBs, we investigated a cohort of 10 hepatoblastomas by microarrays aiming to identify relevant chromosome regions and genes. Design/Methods: An arrayCGH 180K platform was performed, and we have characterized the copy number profile of two different commercial HB cell lines as well as two hepatocellular carcinoma lineages. Results: The arrayCGH analysis revealed quite stable genomes in this kind of embryonal tumor. Four HBs presented with no detectable chromosomal imbalances, whereas four of them exhibited mainly wholechromosome and arm aneuploidies, with a prevalence of gains affecting 1q and the entire chromosomes 2 and 8. Few focal alterations could be delimitated, including a 2q24.3 amplification in two tumors sharing a minimum common region of 5,3 Mb that harbors 20 genes; a complex rearrangement of noncontiguous deletions at 3p26.1p25.2; and a large 55 Mb segment deleted at 4q314q25. Two HBs presented a higher load of chromosomal rearrangements compared to the HB group. Conclusions: The characterization of the liver tumor cell lines highlighted the quiet chromosomal landscape of the embryonal liver tumors compared to their adult counterpart, hepatocellular carcinomas, which carry several cytogenetic changes in a complex genome. Our data suggested that aneuploidy possibly plays a limited role in HB tumorigenesis, rather linked to the process of acquisition of entire chromosomes than to the amplification of oncogenes and tumor suppressors losses.

Sol\u00f3rzano2, J. Shalkow 3, R. Rodr\u00edguez4, A. Le\u00f3n5, Cruz1, Institute of Surgical 2National Institute of Pediatrics, Radiology, Mexico, Mexico; 3Ministry Of Health, Childhood Cancer, Mexico, Mexico; 4National Institute of Pediatrics, Pathology, Mexico, Mexico; 5Ministry Oncology, Mexico, Mexico Background/Objectives: Infantile hepatic hemangioendothelioma (IHEE) is the most common benign liver tumor in infancy. Presenting symptoms may include abdominal distention, hepatomegaly, associated cutaneous hemangiomas, congestive heart failure (CHF), anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Recently, propranolol has proven a good therapeutic alternative. Design/Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 10 cases of IHEE treated with propranolol at the Surgical Oncology Department of the National Institute of Pediatrics in Mexico between 2007 and 2016. Demographic, clinical data and outcomes were collected. Results: There were 7 girls and 3 boys. All were diagnosed after birth, except one by prenatal ultrasound. All presented with a palpable abdominal mass, 7 had CHF, 6 had associated cutaneous hemangiomas and bilobar liver involvement. One developed thrombocytopenia. No case presented hypothyroidism. Diagnosis was confirmed by Doppler US and angioCTscan. All were treated firstline with propranolol at 2.5 mg/Kg/day after cardiac evaluation, with no adverse reactions to treatment. Response was seen at 3 months. After radiographic response, propranolol was gradually waned. Nine patients are alive without recurrence between 3 and 8 years followup. Eight showed complete response, one did not respond and required hepatic embolization. One patient died due to severe coagulopathy (KasabachMerrit syndrome). Conclusions: Propranolol offers an excellent therapeutic alternative to IHEE, probably due to its antiangiogenic properties (vasoconstriction, decreased expression of VEGF, and apoptosis of capillary endothelial cells), with 90% survival and no recurrence in this series. 80% of our patients had complete clinical and radiographic response without adverse reactions to treatment. P-258 Aggressive Hepatoblastoma is Associated with C/EBPA Mediated DeDifferentiation of Hepatocytes into Cells Expressing Stem Cell Markers N. Timchenko 1, A. Cast1, L. Valanejad1, Zhu3, S. Shin1 1Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Division of Pediatric General and Thoracic Surgery, Cincinnati, USA; 2Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Division of Pathology, Cincinnati, USA; 3St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Memphis, USA Background/Objectives: Aggressive form of Hepatoblastoma, HBL, is associated with a poor prognosis. Tumor suppressor proteins (TSPs) are usually eliminated in HBL. While examining a large cohort of HBL patients, we have identified a group of aggressive HBL samples which express high levels of TSPs. One of these TSPs, C/EBP, is dephosphorylated at Ser190. The goal of this work was to determine the role of posttranslationally modified C/EBP in aggressive liver cancer and determine molecular mechanisms by which dephC/EBP causes development of liver cancer. Design/Methods: To test the role of Ser190deph C/EBP in liver cancer, we generated a mouse model, C/EBPS193A, and investigated development of spontaneous liver cancer. These mice were also treated with Diethylnitrosamine (DEN); and liver cancer was examined by stateoftheart approaches. Liver cancer was also investigated in additional models of aggressive liver cancer such as Pten/p53 DKO mice. Results: We found that dephosphorylation of C/EBP converts this protein from a TSP into an oncogene. Using C/EBPS193A mice and liver samples from patients (HBL and HCC), we found that mouse and human C/EBP, dephosphorylated at Ser193/Ser190 correspondingly, causes dedifferentiation of hepatocytes into cells which express markers of stem cells (tumor initiating hepatocytes, TIH). The S193dephC/EBPdependent pathway of transformation of hepatocytes into TIH includes increased hepatocyte proliferation, multinucleation with intranuclear inclusions expressing DLK1 and containing glycogen. The molecular mechanisms of this transformation are associated with epigenetic alteration and formation of high MW multiprotein complexes. Conclusions: In patients with aggressive HBL, dephosphorylation of C/EBP at Ser 190 converts this tumor suppressor into protein with oncogenic activities. The tumor promotion activity of oncogenic form of C/EBP includes the transformation of hepatocytes into tumor initiating cells that express markers of stem cells. These findings provide molecular basis for development of a therapy to treat aggressive liver cancer. P-259 Role of Hepatic Artery Blockage in the Treatment of High Risk Infantile Hepatic Hemangioma J. Wang 1, Q. Shu1, M. J. Cai1, J. Mao1, X. Chen1 1Children's Hospital Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Department of Surgical Oncology, Hangzhou, China Background/Objectives: Infantile Hepatic hemangioma (IHH) is the most common tumor of the liver during infancy. Children with diffuse lesions are more likely to have a greater risk of death, especially in cases with severe congestive heart failure (CHF) and abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS). Aggressive treatment is crucial to improve mortality. In this study, the efficacy of hepatic artery blockage in the treatment of high risk IHH was evaluated. Design/Methods: Nineteen patients with diffuse IHH aged from 12d to 37d admitted to our center between Jan. 2014 and Sep. 2016 were included in this study. Clinical data were retrospectively analyzed. Glucocorticoid (methylprednisolone, 4mg/kg/day) plus propranolol the firstline treatment. Symptoms including CHF or ACS could not relieve or even deteriorated 48 hours after drug administration in 8 patients (high risk group). Hepatic artery blockage was suggested in high risk group. Five cases underwent surgery (4 cases by hepatic artery ligation and one case blocked by microcoil embolization). Other 3 cases refused hepatic artery blockage method kept glucocorticoid plus propranolol treatment. Results: In cases underwent hepatic artery blockage, CHF and ACS relieved promptly after surgery in 4 cases (including 3 cases of hepatic artery ligation and 1 case of hepatic artery embolization), 1 case had deteriorated heart failure and died eventually. Other 3 cases in high risk group refused hepatic artery blockage all died from deteriorated CHF and ACS. Conclusions: Severe congestive heart failure and abdominal compartment syndrome are high risk factors in children with diffuse infantile hepatic hemangioma. Blockage blood flow of hepatic artery is a simple method to relieve CHF and ACS. Hepatic artery blockage combined with drug therapy may improve mortality of high risk IHH. P-260 Report of Childhood Hepatoblastoma: 74 Cases from a Single Center T. Wang 1, C. Pan1, J. Tang1, Q. Ye1, M. medical center, Hematology/Oncology, Shanghai, China Background/Objectives: To investigate the efficacy of the protocol for pediatric hepatoblastoma and the prognostic factors. Design/Methods: All consecutive cases were divided into either low risk group or high risk group according to grouping criteria. Complete remission was defined as both negative for imaging and fetoprotein. Retrospective analysis was performed for clinical features, short and longterm outcomes and prognostic factors. Results: 74 cases including 45 males and 29 females were enrolled. The median age at diagnosis was 1.7 years old. According to PRETEXT staging, 18 cases were in stage III and 56 in stage IIIIV. 19 of 74 cases existed distant metastasis at first presentation including 13 with lungs and/or pleura metastasis. The median cycles of chemotherapy were 5 in low risk group and 8 in high risk group. AFP was back to normal after median 5 cycles of chemotherapy in total plus surgery and 2 cycles post total tumor resection. Untill August 30, 2016, the median followup time was 24.17 months. 59 cases achieved complete remission. 1 case did not reach remission, 3 progressed, another 5 relapsed, and total 6 cases already died. The estimated five years EFS were 72.4% and OS were 90%. The five years EFS and OS in low risk group were both 100%, and those in high risk group were 68% and 87.6%, respectively. The five years OS rates were 75.3% and 94.9% respectively for with and without distant metastasis (P=0.016). After 3 cycles of chemotherapy post tumor resection, AFP returned to normal in 43 and still high in 26 cases, with five years OS rates were 100% and 80.9%, respectively (P = 0.011). Conclusions: The result of this protocol is reasonable when comparing with worldwide researchs. Besides staging, metastasis, pathological subtypes, postoperative AFP after 3 cycles of chemotherapy back to normal or not is also a prognostic factor. Solid Non Brain Tumours Germ Cell Tumours P-261 Experience of Low and Intermediate Risk Malignant ExtraCranial Pediatric Germ Cell Tumors at CCHE S. Ahmed1,2, O. 1,2, unit, Cairo, Egypt; 757357hospital, Clinical research, Cairo, Egypt Background/Objectives: Survival rates for children with malignant extra cranial germ cell tumors (MGCTs) have increased significantly. Excellent outcomes are not distributed uniformly across the heterogeneous distribution of stage, histologic features, and primary tumor site. Sustained favorable outcome with therapy reduction in low and intermediate risk encourages lesser toxic therapy to decrease long term side effects. Design/Methods: Out of 122 eligible patients with MGCTs, a retrospective analysis was done for 47 cases, stratified and treated at CCHE according to AGCT0132 protocol adopted for low and intermediate risk MGCTs, from July 2007 till end of December 2015. All cases were followed up until June 2016. Results: For low and intermediate risk MGCTs, mean age was 4.3 years. Low risk (LR) patients were 23 (19 testicular and 4 ovarian). Yolk sac tumor predominates in male cases while main histological types in female cases were Mixed GCT, followed by Dysgerminoma. Intermediate risk (IR) were 24 cases with male to female ratio 1.7:1, with two extragonadal cases (2 males with sacrococcygeal tumors) and 22 gonadal cases (13 males and 9 females). Yolk sac tumor predominates in male cases while main histological types in female cases were Yolk sac tumors, Mixed GCT, and Dysgerminoma. Five years OS were 100% and 95.7% for LR and IR respectively, while five years EFS were 88 % and 91.3 % for LR and IR respectively. Conclusions: Reduction of therapy did not compromise the favorable outcome in the low and intermediate risk groups with excellent salvage potential. Long term survival raises concerns about late side effects encouraging more therapy reduction. P-262 Outcome of the Sacrococcygeal Teratoma: A Single Institutional Study T.T. Nguyen 1 1Dr Nguyen Thanh Truc, Children Hospital N 2, HoChiMinh city, Vietnam Background/Objectives: To report our initial experience with Sacrococcygeal Tumors (SCT) treated at our hospital over a 5 year period with reference to clinical presentations, surgical attentions and short outcomes like: urinary and defecation functions, and tumor recurrence. Background: statement of the problem e.g. incidence, difficulty with diagnosis, poor antenatal diagnosis, late referral or difficulties with referral. The rarity of SCT indicates the need for concentration in a specialist center and the need for long term follow up. Design/Methods: All infants with Sacrococcygeal tumors who had surgery in our hospital from 1/2010 till 12/2015 were selected. Details of gender, prenatal investigation, presentation,preoperative investigations, initial surgical outcome and short term follow up were noted. Only patients with a follow up greater than one year were included. Results: Of 44 cases of Sacrococcygeal tumors 16 (36%) were male and 28 (64%) were female. Chief complaint was Sacrococcygeal mass. A prenatal diagnosis was established in 23 (53), among these 21 cases had cesarean. The remaining 21 cases without prenatal diagnosis were delivered normally. Most, 42 cases, were delivered at term. Preoperative investigation included Ultrasound (22) CT scan (20) and MRI in 12. AFP and BHCG were done in 79.5%( and 77.3 %. The mean age at diagnosis was 1.2 day and surgery was complete resection with coccycgectomy (35) or without coccycgectomy(9). Mean length of stay was 18 days. Complications included: wound infection (6 cases), wound dehiscence (3 cases), rectal perforation in need of temporary stoma (2cases). In the short term (15 year) constipation was noted in 5 patients, 1 local benign and 2 malignant recurrences with an average time to recurrence of 12 moths (benign and malignancy is defined as AFP high associated recurrent institut tumor ) Conclusions: Sacrococcygeal tumor surgery in infants is a relatively safe procedure not without potential complications. P-263 Sacrococcygeal Teratoma: Analysis of Surgical Outcome N. Peters Chandigarh Surgery, Chandigarh, India Background/Objectives: We reviewed our experience with presentation and treatment of sacrococcygeal teratoma (SCT). Design/Methods: From July 2000 - May 2016, charts of 14 patients of SCT were retrospectively reviewed. Results: There were 11 females and 3 males. Age at time of surgery ranged from 1 day to 8 years (median 58 days). Seven patients underwent surgery within 1st week of life and 4 were antenatally diagnosed. 6 patients underwent surgery between 1.5 to 8 years, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (3) and non resolving perianal abscess (1) being the reason for delayed surgery. Ten patients were of Altman type I, 3 were type II and 1 patient was of type III. Eight patients underwent CT scan and 4 had preop ultrasound. Two patients had giant SCT (>10cm). Serum AFP levels ranged from 4.36 - 48400 ng/ml. Levels were raised for all cases of malignancy and 6 of the 8 others. Levels fell to normal within 1 year for all patients. One patient with normal AFP and mature histology developed recurrence after 1 year. Two patients, 1 each with giant benign and malignant tumor developed neurogenic bowel and bladder. Ten patients had mature histology, 1 had immature and remaining 3 had malignant histology. There was no postoperative mortality. One patient (mature histology and type III morphology) died at 5 months post operative due to unrelated causes. The median follow up was 3 years (range 117 years), most recent being a telephonic follow up. All survivors are disease free and had a good quality of life. Conclusions: Surgical excision of SCT is associated with good outcome. Serum AFP levels may take up to 1 year to normalize. Recurrence can occur even with mature histology; hence long term follow up is required. Neurogenic bladder and bowel incontinence may be associated with large benign and malignant tumors. P-264 Profile of Paediatric Orbital and Periorbital Tumors A Report from a Tertiary Eye Care Centre in India N. Pushker 1, R. Meel1, A. shashni1, M.S. Institute of Medical New Delhi, ophthalmology, Ansari Nagar New Delhi, India; 2All India Institute of Medical Sciences New Delhi, ocular pathology, Ansari Nagar New Delhi, India Background/Objectives: To assess the frequency of occurrence of orbital and periorbital tumors in paediatric age group operated at our centre. Design/Methods: This was a retrospective study in which all the patients of age less than 16 years who were operated for orbital and periorbital tumor at our centre from 2015 to 2016 were included. Results: A total of 109 patients were included in this study. The mean age of presentation was 7.82 \u00b1 5.03 years. Among these 57 % were male and 43 % were female. 44 cases (40.4%) were dermoid. were operated for orbital and periorbital tumor at our centre, dermoid was found to be the most common tumor requiring surgical intervention. P-265 Dermoids in Paediatric Orbit A Retrospective Case Series R. Meel 1, A. Shashni1, N. Pushker1, M.S. Institute of Medical New Delhi, ophthalmology, Ansari Nagar New Delhi, India; 2All India Institute of Medical Sciences New Delhi, ocular pathology, Ansari Nagar New Delhi, India Background/Objectives: To study the clinical and radiological features of ocular and orbital dermoid in paediatric age group Design/Methods: A retrospective case series analysing the clinical and radiological features of ocular and orbital dermoid in patients less than 16 years of age who were operated at our centre were included in this study Results: Total 33 patient were included in this study. The mean age of the patient was 6.71 \u00b1 5.53 years. Of all the patients 70 % were male and 30% were female. 51.5% (17/33) cases had limbal dermoid, 24.2% at frontonasal suture line), 15% (5/33) cases had (located at (8/33) cases were associated with Goldenhar syndrome. Majority of the cases showed cystic lesion with fat density on imaging (Ultrasound biomicroscopy and Computed tomography). None of the patients had an intracranial extension Conclusions: Dermoid is the most common benign tumor of paediatric eye and orbit and may present as ocular surface mass or periocular tumor. Most cases can be successfully managed with surgical excision. P-266 Pediatric Testicular Tumors in Poland. A Report from the Polish Pediatric Solid Tumors Group (20082016) J. Stefanowicz 1, M.

Design/Methods: A statistical analysis was performed on the clinical data and the results of treatment of patients with testicular tumors reported to the database of extracranial germ cell tumors of the Polish Pediatric Solid Tumours Group in the years 20082016. Results: The study included 138 patients aged 0 to 18 years old who were treated according to TGM 95 protocol. The mean age of respondents was 13.8 years, the median 16.3. For the whole group, 5YOS was 95.6\u00b12.2%, 5YEFS 88.1\u00b13.3%. Children over 10 yr formed the majority (84%), while 16% were patients 10 yr. The results of treatment were comparable in both age groups (5year OS in the group of children 10 yr. 100% vs. children >10 yr. 95.9\u00b12.4%, p=0.419, 5year of these were secretory tumors (84%). It was found that the results of treatment did not differ in the groups of nonsecretory and secretory AFP concentration was 2670.7 \u00b14966, a median 792, range 11.0 - 30 000, IU/ml. The other prognostic factors were analysed: histological structure tumor 5%, other 17%; the stage of disease: 5YOS for stages I, II, III 100%, for stage IV - 84.7\u00b17.2%, p=0.0173, and the risk group: in the high risk group 5YOS was 90\u00b14.8%, in the standard risk group 100%, p=0.0234. Conclusions: The results of treatment of patients in the developmental age with testicular tumors in Poland are very good. The most significant prognostic factors are the stage and the risk group. Solid Non Brain Tumours Rare Tumours P-267 Multiple Mutations in Genes Associated with Colon Carcinoma: Analysis of Whole Exome Sequencing and Array Comparative Genome Hybridization (ACGH) Data S. Unit, Firenze, Italy Background/Objectives: Colon carcinoma is a rare disease in the pediatric population. A 15yearold male, without a strong family history of cancer, presented with metastatic colonadenocarcinoma, medium grade of differentiation, methylation of MGMT gene, ALK, TRKA, BRAF genes' rearrangements. He died in 16 months after five treatment lines. Whole exome sequencing was employed to identify singlenucleotide variants, small insertion/deletions, number abnormalities in the patient's and parent's germline. Design/Methods: DNA was extracted from the patient's and parent's blood. DNA libraries were constructed and sequenced exon 1 of BCL2A1 gene a variant inherited from both parents (c.245G> A); in exon 33 of POLE gene a variant (c4187A> G) inherited from his father and in exon 19 a variant (c.2083T > A) inherited from the mother; in exon 22 of the ATM gene a variant (c3161C> G) inherited from both parents. Using array CGH analysis we found: an interstitial deletion of 4q32.3 MARCH1 gene, inherited from the mother and an interstitial deletion of 7q11.22 AUTS2 gene inherited from his father. Conclusions: The mutation identified in homozygosity of BCL2A1 gene, involved in embryogenesis and tumorigenesis processes, is shown in Human Gene Mutation Database as associated with an increased risk of colorectal carcinoma. The variants of the POLE and ATM genes, expressed in heterozygous, present an uncertain pathogenic role; they are not reported in the literature but in ClinVar (archive which shows the correlations between clinically significant variations and phenotypes) are related with increased susceptibility to colon cancer. The POLE gene variants identified in our patient, may correlate with an early onset and a more aggressive course, instead it is hard to speculate on the role of the deletions found in MARCH1 and AUTS2 genes in absence of protein expression studies. P-268 LongTerm Survivorship for Children and Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is among the most common childhood cancers in subSaharan Africa and continues to occur at high numbers despite the increased availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Although onetwo year survival estimates for pediatric KS have been reported throughout the region, longerterm outcomes have not been described. Design/Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the pediatric KS database of HIVinfected children and adolescents diagnosed with KS at a pediatric HIV referral center in Lilongwe, Malawi. Longterm survivorship was determined in patients diagnosed between 20062013 that were still alive at last followup. All but two survivors were treated with chemotherapy plus ART according to Malawian national guidelines; the two exceptions received ART alone. Typically, patients received 8 cycles of bleomycin and vincristine over 6 months. Evaluating characteristics of survivors only, demographics, duration of survival, time off of chemotherapy, and need for 2nd line chemotherapy or ART were described. Results: There were 50 (31%) longterm survivors among 161 HIVrelated cases of pediatric KS. The median age at time of KS diagnosis among survivors was 8 years (interquartile range [IQR] 4.613); there were 22 females (44%). Median overall survival was 4.8 years (IQR 3.66.8), with the longest survivor alive 10.5 years from date of KS diagnosis. Fourteen (28%) patients experienced relapse requiring additional doses of chemotherapy and remained alive at time of data collection. The median time off of chemotherapy was 3.5 years (IQR 2.15.3) with the longest duration reaching 10 years. In total, 28 (56%) patients were still on 1st line ART, with 22 (44%) receiving 2nd line ART. Conclusions: Longterm survival is possible for HIVinfected children and adolescents with KS in Malawi despite myriad limitations. The majority of patients were able to achieve longterm disease control with upfront chemotherapy and lifelong ART, with over half of children still on 1st line ART regimens. P-269 Potential for Improved Survival Outcomes after Treatment with Intensified Chemotherapy and Antiretroviral Therapy in Children with Pulmonary Kaposi Sarcoma Presenting with Severe Pleural Effusions J. P. 2Texas Children's Hospital, Pediatrics, Houston, USA Background/Objectives: In the initial eight years of the pediatric Kaposi sarcoma (KS) program in Lilongwe, Malawi, there has never been a survivor of pulmonary KS (n>10) after upfront treatment with bleomycin and vincristine. With all but two patients dying within 6 months, and the longest duration of survival being 9 months, a programmatic shift was implemented to initiate patients with pulmonary KS on a chemotherapy regimen intensified by adding doxorubicin. We report a case series of pulmonary KS patients with improved survival. Design/Methods: We evaluated a series of HIVinfected children presenting with pulmonary KS manifested by large serosanguineous pleural effusions in addition to characteristic hyperpigmented KS skin lesions or woody edema. Patients were treated with an intensified chemotherapy regimen of doxorubicin, bleomycin, and vincristine (8 cycles total, given every 3 weeks) plus proteaseinhibitor based antiretroviral therapy. Clinical characteristics and treatment response were described. Results: There were three patients (one female) with pulmonary KS that achieved disease control and prolonged survival. Patient ages at presentation were 7, 8, and 14 years. All presented with large serosanguineous pleural effusions and severe respiratory distress requiring supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula (for duration ranging 25 weeks) and multiple thoracentesis procedures (range 215 taps), but ultimately achieved resolution of hypoxia and effusions. One patient had concurrent skin and lymph node KS lesions and the other two both had characteristic woody edema. All had pleural fluid cytology evaluation performed; as anticipated, none yielded malignant KS cells. All three children are alive in partial remission with stable disease achieving overall survival duration of 7, 10, and 22 months, off of chemotherapy for respective durations of 1, 4, and 16 months. Conclusions: Improved survival may be achievable for pediatric pulmonary KS patients receiving intensified chemotherapy and antiretroviral therapy. Longer followup is required to determine definitive longterm outcomes. P-270 Secondary Malignancies After Chilhood Cancers: A Single Center Experience F. Akici 1, G. Aydogan1, Z. Salcioglu1, G. Oncology, Istanbul, Turkey; 2Acibadem University Atakent Hospital, Department of Pediatric Bone Marrow Transplantation, Istanbul, Turkey; 3Istanbul University School of Medicine, Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Istanbul, Turkey; 4Kanuni Sultan Suleyman Training and Research Hospital , Pediatric Surgery, Istanbul, Turkey; 5Istanbul University School of Medicine, Radiation Oncology, Istanbul, Turkey Background/Objectives: The occurrence of second malignancies (SM) is an important late event following the treatment of childhood cancers. It is 3 folds greater thn the normal population, the incidence is about 3% in the first 20 years after pirmary diagnosis. Design/Methods: The incidence of SMs is studied in a population of 1678 patients with minumum 3 years follow up after cessation of chemoradiotherapy or radiotherapy for childhood cancers between June 1990 and January 2017. The study included the patients treated in inpatient and outpatient clinics of Kanuni Sultan S\u00fcleyman Research and Training Hospital. Results: SMs were found in 6 (0,5%) patients. The mean time for the occurence of SM was 8 years (314 years). Case 1: A girl 9 years old with diagnosis of Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin Lymphoma stage 3 treated with both radiotherapy and chemotherapy developed thyroid papillary carcinoma 7 years 3months after primary diagnosis. Case 2: A boy 8 years old diagnosed as non Hodgkin Lymhoma developed hepatocellular carcinoma 10 years after treatment. Case 3: B cell nonHodgkin lymphoma patient 3 years old was diagnosed as epidermoid carcinoma of external ear 12 years after. Case 4: 8 years old male patient developed adrenal cortex carcinoma 7 years after treated successfully for Burkitt Lymphoma. Case 5: A female patient was diagnosed as breast carcinoma after 14 years of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treatment. Case 6: Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma of parotid gland was seen 3 years after completition of ALL chemotherapy at age of 8. Conclusions: All of the SM s were solid neoplasms. One patient has thyroid carcinoma which could depend on thyroid irradiation, the alkalyting agents could be the cause of the other neoplasms. Continued followup is mandatory after treatment for childhood cancers. Since the prognosis of most SM is unfavorable, early recognition and prevention are important. P-271 Clinical Characterization of Malignant Rhabdoid Tumors - The Sick Kids Experience A. Fonseca 1, A. Gupta1, R. Grant1, A. Huang1 1The Haematology Oncology, Toronto, Canada Background/Objectives: Rhabdoid Tumors (RTs) are rare cancers defined by biallelic loss of function alterations of SMARCB1, which encodes a critical component of the SWI/SNF chromatinremodeling complex. They can arise in the brain where they are called Atypical Teratoid/Rhabdoid Tumors (ATRTs) and in various extracranial locations where they are called Malignant Rhabdoid Tumors (MRTs). Both ATRTs and MRTs are frequently lethal diseases for which best therapeutic approaches remains to be determined. Herein, we describe the Sick Kids experience. Design/Methods: Patients diagnosed with MRT at the hospital for Sick Children between 19962016 were identified and charts reviewed. Demographic data, treatment details and survival information was collected. Results: We identified twentyfive patients diagnosed with MRTs between 1996 and 2016. Median age at diagnosis was 3.2 years (1 month 16.6 years), 64%(n=14) were female and 36%(n=8) were male. Thirtytwo percent tumors neck (n=1). Most of the patients, 56% presented with advanced disease (stage III and IV), 8% (n=2) of the patients presented with multifocal disease and correspond to patients diagnosed with rhabdoid tumor predisposition syndrome. The median time to progression was 6 months (ranging from 1 month to 25 months). Most of the patients (n=20) were treated with multimodal therapy including chemotherapy in 18 patients, radiation therapy in 11 patients and surgery in 14 patients. Only 20% of patients are alive and free of disease, 64% of patients succumbed to the disease. Conclusions: MRTs continues to be a disease with poor outcomes. Young patients and patients presenting with metastatic disease have a dismal prognosis. Insights in the biology of this entity are urgently needed to guide therapeutic approaches and the development of clinical trials. P-272 Paratestitular Rhabdomyosarcoma in Children: Surgical Analysis Faria4 1Instituto de C\u00e2ncer, Pediatric Surgery, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; 2Instituto Nacional de C\u00e2ncer, Pediatric Research Nurse, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; 3Instituto Nacional de C\u00e2ncer, Pediatric Oncology, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; 4Instituto Nacional de C\u00e2ncer, Pathology, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Background/Objectives: In children, about 7% of all cases of genitourinary rhabdomyosarcoma are paratesticular in origin. Prognosis for paratesticular rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is favorable; approximately 60% to 80% of patients have localized disease at diagnosis. The purpose of this study was to report a retrospective review of paratesticular RMS in children treated at the Pediatric Oncology Department at one institution in Brazil. The prognostic, surgical and histopathologic aspects were analyzed. Design/Methods: From 1987 to 2017, a total of twenty five patients with ages ranging from 10 months to 16 years old with pathologically confirmed diagnosis of paratesticular RMS treated at our institution. Results: The median age at presentation was 12 years (range 10 months - 16 years). Sixteen patients were 10 years old (76%). Eighteen patients had initial surgery at nononcologic hospital and seven needed a second surgery. One third of patients who underwent initial surgery outside our institution required second surgery (three hemiscrotectomy and four lymphadenectomy). Partial cystectomy was performed in one patient due to vesical metastasis. The histopathological classification of RMS was: embryonal in 19, alveolar in four and not classified RMS in two. The patients were treated following the International Rhabdomyosarcoma Study Group from 1987 to 2008 (88%) and European Pediatric Soft Sarcoma Group protocol since 2009 (12%). All patients received chemotherapy and only seven received radiotherapy. The 5year overall survival (OS) was 76%, with follow up from 6 months to 20 years (median 4 years). The mortality among patients 10 years of age was 37,5%, while all patients < 10 years are alive. Conclusions: The 5year OS was worse in patients 10 years old, confirming current data. The patients who underwent initial surgery at nononcologic hospital needed second surgery more frequently, including hemiscrotectomy. Continued effort is required to educate providers on appropriate workup of scrotal masses to avoid scrotal violation. P-273 Our Experience with Primary Total Thyroidectomy and Lymph Node Biopsy in Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma Z. Jenovari 1, P. Hauser2, Garami2, Varga2, T. Budi2, T. 1Semmelweis University, 2nd. Department of Pediatrics, Budapest, Hungary; 2Semmelweis University, 2nd Department of Pediatrics, Budapest, Hungary Background/Objectives: There are concerns about the optimal primer surgery in case of papillary thyroid carcinoma. From 2006 we moved on the total thyroidectomy and regional lymph node biopsy as the first attempted procedures in all cases, to provide opportunity for postoperative iodine isotope therapy. There are few evidences about the results of this procedure. Design/Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the data of the children underwent primary total thyroidectomy in our unit from 20062016. Results: 29 patients were found, the mean age 15.3 year (720), M/F ratio 8/21. All had papillary thyroid carcinoma proven by FNAB and histology postoperatively. US and MRI were done for all. There was not pulmonary metastasis detected. 12 patients had regional lymph node enlargement on radiology. 13 patients underwent lymph node biopsy of the intraoperatively suspected nodules, central neck lymph node dissection done in 5 cases. Lateral neck dissection never attempted as primer procedure. The recurrent laryngeal nerve and the parathyroid glands (at least 1) were identified and preserved. None of the patients had recurrent nerve lesion, or permanent hypocalcemia, or residual thyroid tissue. 13 out of 29 patients received postoperative iodine isotope therapy. Only 5 out of the 13 had pathologic lymph node enlargement postoperatively (>1cm, positive scan or MRI). 4 out of this 5 patients had isotope treatment twice, one patient 3 times. Finally 4 out of 5 underwent extended regional lymph node dissection. The average follow up was 59 months (6131 months). Conclusions: The primary total thyroidectomy in papillary thyroid carcinoma is effective and safe procedure, the complications, (recurrent nerve injury or hypocalcemia) can be minimised by experienced surgeon. The postoperative iodine isotope therapy seems less effective for pathologic enlarged lymph nodes, in this cases the primer regional lymph node dissection of the affected region should be prior to the isotope therapy. P-274 Immunotherapy of Metastatic Pediatric Melanoma with Checkpoint E. 1, M. Kyncl2, R. M. Kalinova3, L. Krskova3, O. Belohlavek4, D. Sumerauer1 12nd Faculty of Medicine Charles University and University Hospital Motol, Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Prague 5, Czech Republic; 22nd Faculty of Medicine Charles University and University Hospital Motol, radiology, Prague 5, Czech Republic; 32nd Faculty of Medicine Charles University and University Hospital Motol, Pathology and Molecular Medicine, Prague 5, Czech Republic; 4Na Homolce Hospital, PET Centre, Prague 5, Czech Republic Background/Objectives: Metastatic melanoma in children is rare, fatal disease. The introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitor antibodies has dramatically improved the clinical outcomes for adult patients with advanced melanoma. Data on checkpoint inhibitors treatment in children with melanoma is limited. Design/Methods: We present two cases of primary metastatic melanoma in uncommon locations in children treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Both patients were diagnosed and treated at our centre within the last 2 years. Results: The first patient was a 16yearold girl with metastatic melanoma of unknown primary site (MUP) with multifocal visceral infiltrates. The second patient was boy primary leptomeningeal melanoma in neurocutaneous melanosis. In both BRAF mutations were absent. Due to the significant melanoma dissemination urgent control of the disease was required. Both patients started with chemotherapy CVD (cisplatin, vinblastine, dacarbazine). The girl with MUP reached partial response (PR) after 2 cycles of CVD and continued with ipilimumab monotherapy (3 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 4 doses) with prolonged stable disease (SD). Five weeks after the last ipilimumab administration disease progression (DP) was documented. After further 4 CVD cycles second PR was observed. One month after the last CVD course pembrolizumab monotherapy (2 mg/kg) started. The girl expired from rapidly progressive disease within 37 days of the initial dose of pembrolizumab. The boy with CNS melanoma had only SD after 3 courses of CVD. That's why we decided to continue with palliative craniospinal irradiation (36 Gy). Monotherapy with pembrolizumab (2 mg/kg every 3 weeks) was started during radiotherapy. No objective response was observed after radiotherapy and during immunotherapy. He died 23 days after the 3rd dose of pembrolizumab from CNS melanoma progression. Conclusions: Immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors in our patients was well tolerated, but did not change their disease course. P-275 Inflammatory Myofibroblastic Tumor in Children: Morphological and Molecular Characterization A. Suleymanova1, E. Imyanitov2, V. T. Shamanskaya 1, Kachanov1, Surgery, Moscow, Russia Background/Objectives: Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) is a rare type of childhood malignancies with intermediate biological behavior. The aim of the study was to analyze clinical, morphological and molecular features of IMT in a cohort of patients treated in Russian federal center. Design/Methods: Nine patients with IMT during the period from 01.2012 to 12.2016 were included in the analyses. The diagnosis was established by histological examination. ALK immunostaining was done with two different antibodies: ALK (ultra) and ALK (D5F3). Rearrangement of the ALK gene was detected by FISH. ALK, ROS1, PDGFRB fusion genes were analyzed by PCR. Results: Median age at diagnosis was 61.9 months (range 5.9 102.5 months). In most cases the tumor was located in the abdominal cavity 4/9 (44.4%). The histological type of the tumor was represented by a compact/spindle cell variant in 5/9 of protein was observed in 6/9 (66.6%) cases, in 5/6 cases expression was detected by two antibodies. In 1 case, the expression of ALK antibody (D5F3) was positive, while the reaction with ALK antibody (ultra) was negative. In ALKpositive tumors the following translocations were detected: 1/4 TFGex4/ROS1ex35 was detected. In 4/9 (44.4%) tumors translocations were not detected, of which 2/4 (50%) were cases with positive expression of ALK protein. All patients are alive. The median follow up was 24.3 months (range 15.234.6 months). Conclusions: This work allowed to conduct an indepth study of the clinical, morphological and moleculargenetic characteristics of IMT in a cohort of children in Russia. It was shown that in some cases expression of ALK protein does not correlate with the presence of gene rearrangements. P-276 Childhood Lung Adenocarcinoma Treated with Crizotinib C. Radiology, Pediatric Pathology, Ankara, Turkey; 5Hacettepe Univercity Medical Faculty, Pathology, Ankara, Turkey Background/Objectives: Although lung cancer is the most common invasive type of cancer worldwide, it is a rare in children. Goal directed treatment besides chemotherapy has become popular in the last decade. Crizotinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor and has been shown to affect survival in NSCLC patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) or cros oncogene (ROS1) Here an adolescent case of adenocarcinoma with crizotinib treatment was reported. Results: The patient had complaints of night fever, lymph node enlargement and weight loss for six months of duration. Chemotherapy was started after epithelial neoplasm thymoma type B3 was diagnosed from supraclavicular lymph node metastasis and biopsy from lung nodules. The patient was referred to our hospital due to no response to the treatment. Histopathologic evaluation of the lymph node biopsy in our hospital revealed lung adenocarcinoma metastasis. A mass of 4x5 cm in the right lung middle lobe, bilateral parenchymal, subpleural nodular lesions, focal areas of consolidation and signs of lymphangitis carcinomatosis was detected. Two courses of docetaxel and gemcitabine was administered initially and crizotinib of 250 mg/dose bid started since immunohistochemistry for ROS1 was positive. First assessment after the treatment showed excellent clinical and radiologic response. Although primary mass lesion regressed after 7 \u00bd month of crizotinib treatment, 36 Gy of cranial radiotherapy was administered due to brain metastasis. Subsequently, cisplatin and pemetrexed treatments were started. Conclusions: Lung cancer is a rare tumor of childhood and constitutes 0.2% of all childhood cancers. This illustrative case reminds adenocarcinoma when there is lack of clinical and pathological correlation and emphasizes the assessment for monoclonal antibody therapy by checking the presence of oncogenes as ROS1 and ALK. Although treatment is challenging in patients presented with advanced stage disease, currently survival rates were significantly improved with such goal directed therapies. P-277 Pediatric Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma: A Single Institute Experience from Developing Country P. Khullar 1, A. Thakwani1, K. Chufal1, K. Medi1 1Batra Hospital And Medical Research Centre, Radiation Oncology, New Delhi, India Background/Objectives: Pediatric nasopharyngeal carcinomas (NPCs) accounts < 1% of all pediatric tumors. There is limited data on clinical features, treatment results, prognostic factors, outcome and late toxicities of pediatric NPC from India Design/Methods: This analysis was carried out in consecutive 47 patients of pediatric NPCs, who were registered at our center in between 1st May 2006 to 30th April 2016 ( 10 years). Patients' records were retrospective reviewed and data obtained from case records files. Patients were treated with Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CTRT) with cisplatin and followed or concurrent CTRT with cisplatin. Results: The median age was 15 years (range 1018 years) and male:female ratio was 1.5:1. The median duration of symptoms was 6 months (range 0.52 years). AJCC stage distribution was stage II 15%, stage III 40%, and stage IV 45%. Distant metastasis at presentation was seen in 5 patients. Complete response was seen in 65% and overall response was observed in 90% of cases. With a median followup time of 36 months, the 3year overall survival (OS) rate, localregional control (LRC) rate and distant metastasisfree survival (DMFS) rate were 42%, 56% and 38% respectively. In multivariate analysis, T4 (p = 0.01) and stage IV (p = 0.001) were the independent adverse prognostic factors for OS. Significant reduction in trismus and xerostomia were observed in patients treated by intense modulated radiotherapy ( IMRT). Conclusions: Most of patients with pediatric NPC present with advanced stage disease at our center. No difference in response rate and outcomes were seen with the two schedules of CTRT ( Neoadjuvant vs concurrent). Local control could be achieved in majority of patients; however, distant metastasis was the most common reason for relapse. Reducing late toxicities with IMRT might be the future direction for the management of pediatric NPC P-278 Solid Pseudopapillary Tumor of the Pancreas in a Patient with a Diagnosis of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex S.S. Kilic 1, M. Alkan1, O. Ozden1 1Cukurova University Faculty Of Medicine, Pediatric Surgery, Adana, Turkey Background/Objectives: Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is a genetic disease that effects to cell development. Epilepsy, mental retardation, development of hamartomas in the different part of body could sign of the TSC. Renal, brain basis tumors and neuroendocrine tumor of the pancreas could develope in TSC patients. Solid Pseudopapillary Tumor of The Pancrease (SPTP) is the low grade malign tumor of the adolescent age. Design/Methods: Cukurova University Medical Faculty Hospital record of a patient who was operated for pancreatic mass investigated. Results: In 2012, Abdominal Magnetic Resonance investigation has made to a 15 years old male TSC patient and a nodulary lesion, measuring 2,5 cm, has found in the tail of pancreas. Nodulary lesion was supposed as hamartoma of pancreas that developed secondary to TSC. Patient was followed up. In 2016, a hypoechoic and sharp edges lesion, measuring 4 cm, was found with Ultrasound (US) investigation in the tail of pancreas. Lesion has solid feature was found by Computed Tomography. Cause of increase in lesion measurements, operation decision was maked. A solid lesion, measuring 5x5x4 cm, in the tail of pancreas has found during operation. Tail of pancreas was detached from side. Splenic artery and vein was tried to detach from lesion, but it was not able. Than, Distal pancreatectomy including lesion was made by using surgical stapler with containing splenic artery and vein. Spleen appeared normal and preserved. Pathology report of lesion was SPTP with tumor free surgical board. One month later an US was made and blood flow of spleen was found normal. There was not residual tumor tissue. Patient is following with no treatment by pediatric oncology. Conclusions: Pathologies of pancreas could develop in TSC patients but SPTP is seen rarely. Lesions in the TSC patients which followed as hamartoma in pancreas should remember that it could be SPTP. P-279 Head and Neck Hemangiomas of Childhood: A Single Center Experience D. Kizmazoglu 1, D. Ince1, N. Agrali2, E. Eylul University Faculty of Medicine, Dept. of Otorhinolaryngology, ZMR, Turkey Background/Objectives: Aim of this study is to analize clinical characteristics and treatment responses of our patients with head/neck hemangiomas. Design/Methods: Medical records of 121 patients with head/neck hemangiomas between 2006 to 2016 were evaluated retrospectively. Results: The median age of diagnosis was 12mos (10days16yrs), F/M:2.0. The localization of lesions were only at head and neck in 85(70.2%) patients, remaining patients have also hemangiomas on other parts of body.Localization of hemangiomas medical treatment.Treatment indications were local complications (haemorrhage, ulceration,infection) (6.7%), life threating organ dysfunction (73.0%) and cosmetic (20.3%). The median followup period was 8 mos (0 mos7yrs). Remaining 55 patients required medical treatment (propranolol in 45, corticosteroids in two cases, both of them in 8 cases). Chemotherapeutics (vincristine, vinblastine and cyclophosphamide) were used in one case. Majority of our cases received propranolol, and there was no observed propranolol related side effects. The median duration of propranolol treatment was 10 mos (10 days - 35 mos).Twentyone patients have still receiving propranolol.Treatment cessation was done in 32 cases.Complete regression was achieved in 13 patients,and partial regression was achieved in 19 cases with propranolol. The patients who had subglottic hemangioma were the most problematic cases because of respiratory and feeding difficulties.Two of them required tracheostomy.Complete regression occured in all subglottic hemangiomas with medical treatment.Ocular complications (ambylopia, strabismus etc) occured in 15 patients with periorbital hemangioma despite medical treatment. Conclusions: Although childhood hemangiomas can regress spontaneously, head/neck hemangiomas are usually required medical treatment because the risk of ocular, feeding and respiratory complications. Novadays propranolol is a well tolerated, effective and safe drug option for treatment of childhood hemangiomas. P-280 Primary Peripheral Neuroectodermal Tumor of Orbit Case Series of a Rare Childhood Malignancy R. Meel 1, S. Kashyap2, N. Pushker1, S. Sen2, M. Bajaj1, S. Bakhshi3 1All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Dr Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences, New Delhi, India; 2All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Dept of Ocular Pathology Dr Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences, New Delhi, India; 3All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Dept of Medical Oncology Dr BRA IRCH, New Delhi, India Background/Objectives: Peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor (pPNET) belongs to the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors. Primary PNET constitutes 4% of all childhood soft tissue tumors. Primary PNET of orbit is rare with only a handful of cases reported in literature. Design/Methods: Retrospective review of clinical records, imaging and histopathology of all primary orbital pPNET presenting in childhood that were treated at our center between Jan 2004 Dec 2016 (13 years). Results: Clinical, imaging and histopathology details of nine pediatric patients with primary orbital pPNET were analyzed. The median age of presentation was 6 years (age range 1.5 months - 13 years). One case presented with congenital PNET of Orbit. 5/9(55.5%) were male and 4/9(44.4%) were female children. Duration of symptoms ranged from 5 days - 8 months (median1.75 months). The most common presenting complaint was proptosis followed by eyelid swelling. Imaging showed variable enhancing mass lesions with heterogeneous attenuation in all, with calcific densities in 2 cases. Calcified tumor matrix was seen as radiating spicules in one case. Bone erosion and extraorbital extension was seen in 8/9 (88.8%) cases. Metastasis to foot was present in one case at presentation. Diagnosis was made on histopathological examination of incision/ excision biopsy specimen in 7 cases, while 2 cases were diagnosed on fine needle aspiration biopsy. All cases showed positivity for MIC2 and S100 protein on immunohistochemistry, and were negative for PAS. Conclusions: Primary PNET is a rare malignancy to occur in pediatric orbit. Majority of the patients in our series presented with large tumors that had extraorbital extension of disease at the time of presentation. P-281 Lipoblastoma and Lipoblastomatosis. 5 Years\u00b4 Experience in a Pediatric Institution M.E. Nana 1, M. Garcia Lombardi1, E. De Lipoblastoma and lipoblastomatosis are rare benign mesenchymal tumors. They occur in infancy and early childhood, generally in boys. The aim of this study is to report clinical characteristics, diagnostic strategy, type of treatment and outcome of pediatric patients (p) with lipoblastoma/lipoblastomatosis (LL). We will compare our results with other published reports. Design/Methods: Retrospective and descriptive study. We reviewed the clinical reports of p with LL admitted at the Oncology Unit of Hospital de Ni\u00f1os Ricardo Gutierrez between January 2012 and January 2017. Results: Six p with LL were admitted in 5 years. They represent 0.8% of all the p treated in this Unit. Boys 4/Girls2. Age range: 5 24 months. Clinical presentation: fast growing and painless mass in all nuclear resonance 1p. Maximum tumor diameter range: 2 to 9 cm. In 4/6p a fine needle aspiration (FNA) was performed with p and 1p without margins). Median followup time: 20 months (R: 4 61 months). None p relapsed and all remained alive. Conclusions: LL represented a small percentage of all the diagnosis in our Unit, All p were younger than 3 years and most of them boys. We used ultrasound and FNA for inicial diagnosis approach and biopsy for confirmation. Surgery was the treatment strategy. No p relapsed. However, the followup time was short. Our results were similar to the published reports. Although LL are rare tumors, they should be considered in infants and children with painless fast growing softtissue tumors. P-282 Congenital Metastatic Department, Barretos, Brazil; 2Botucatu Medical School, Surgery and Orthopedics Department Botucatu, Brazil Background/Objectives: Ewing's Sarcoma/Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumors (EWS/PNET) are extremely rare in newborns. Less than 20 newborns (28 days) with congenital EWS/PNET of soft tissue have been reported in the English literature. The prognosis generally is poor, and most of the babies not survive more than 24 months of life. Design/Methods: To describe a 14dayold newborn diagnosed with metastatic retroperitoneal EWS/PNET with \"blueberrymuffin\"cutaneous lesions. Results: A 14dayold newborn female was admitted due to multiple and progressive skin nodules, associated with hemothorax and signs of central nervous system involvement. She was a fullterm cesarean neonate without a family history of genetic diseases. A physical examination revealed multiple erythemaviolaceous nodules, with firm constancy characterized as \"blueberry muffin\" lesions, were found bilateral ocular proptosis and a posterior thoracicabdominal mass, hard, with poorly defined limits. Computed tomography (CT) detected a massive solid retroperitoneal mass, measuring 6.2 cm x 5 cm, hypodense, with calcifications, involving the Aorta at an angle higher than 180 degrees, invading the superior mediastinum and left pleural cavity, widening the posterior intercostal spaces to the left, encompassing the costal arches, extending to the posterior wall invading left paravertebral musculature reaching the skin; also hypodense solid nodules with contrast enhancement distributed in the liver, spleen, adrenal, and pancreas areas, compatible with hematogenous and lymphatic metastases. Since the mass was unresectable, she was submitted to biopsy of skin lesions and initiated empirical chemotherapy protocol for Neuroblastoma. A pathologic examination found histological evidence of malignant, small round tumor cells. The tumor cells were immunohistochemically positive for CD99 and CD56, compatible with Ewing's Sarcoma / Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumor. Given the aggressiveness of the disease, two days after the diagnosis the newborn died. Conclusions: Our report illustrates the extreme difficulties in managing a newborn with a congenital metastatic EWS/PNET. Since these tumors are highly aggressive, prognosis is terrible, and treatment challenging. P-283 Germline DICER1 Mutations in Twelve Chinese Patients with Pleuropulmonary Blastoma X. Peng 1, S. Cai2, X. Ma3 1Capital Medical University, School of Public Health, Beijing, China; 2Beijing Children's Hospital Capital Medical University, Center for Clinical Epidemiology and Evidencebased Medicine, Beijing, China; 3Beijing Children's Hospital Capital Medical University, Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing, China Background/Objectives: A growing number of studies committed themselves to explore the role of DICER1 mutation in development of PPB. However, the majority of reported cases were Caucasian. Therefore, 12 consecutive cases of sporadic PPB from Beijing Children's Hospital were tested in order to describe the DICER1 mutation status and clinical characteristics of Chinese patients with PPB, which will add more evidence for further understanding of pathogenesis of PPB. Design/Methods: Medical history and family history of 12 children with PPB were collected. Blood samples from children with PPB and their first degree relative were tested for DICER1 mutations by NextGen sequencing. Whole genome sequencing of peripheral blood of the proband, the proband's parents and twin sister, and FFPE of the proband tumor tissue was performed. All participants' parents signed a consent form to genetic testing and medical history collection. Results: Twelve patients with pleuropulmonary blastoma (6 patients suffering from type II pleuropulmonary blastoma and 6 patients suffering from type III pleuropulmonary blastoma, respectively) were evaluated for germline DICER1 mutations. Seven patients were identified deleterious DICER1 mutation, among which 6 mutations lead to premature protein truncation as a result of frameshift mutation or nonsense mutations. Another one case carried a germlineDICER1 mutation which was suspected to deleteriously affect splice site. Case 02 have a total of 135,109 somatic mutations, consisting of a nonsense mutation located within TDG and missense mutations of DICER1. Two DICER1 mutation positive cases were found to have lung cysts preceding the diagnosis of PPB. Furthermore, only one child was found a remarkable family history of thyroid diseases. Conclusions: Germline mutation frequency of Chinese patients with PPB is similar with published studies. Routine germlineDICER1 test might be benefit to improve the accuracy and awareness of differential diagnosis type I PPB from other diseases, especially lung cysts. P-284 Granulosa Cell Tumors: A Study of Nine Rare Cases Over a Period of Fifteen Years in a Single Institute Y. Saadeldin Sadek 1 1Faculty of MedicineUniversity of Alexandria, Pediatric Surgery, Alexandria, Egypt Background/Objectives: Ovarian tumors in children are rare, comprising 1% of all childhood tumors.Juvenile granulosa cell tumors are rare subtypes the sex cordstromal cell tumors. The study aimed at reporting and studying cases of juvenile granulosa cell tumors over a period of 15 years Design/Methods: All cases of juvenile granulosa cell tumors treated over a period of 15 years in the Main University Hospital were reported.They were studied concerning: the age, the ways of clinical presentation and the tumor markers: Alpha Phetoprotein (AFP) and Human Chorionic Gonadotrophic Hormone (HCG),The imaging done for diagnosis, the treatment procedures and follow up were also reported. Results: Nine cases of granulosa cell tumors were reported: 5 cases were retrospective and 4 cases were prospective. Eight cases with an age range 46 years and only one case was 7 months old. All cases presented with pseudo precocious puberty in the form of: breast hypertrophy with extensive suprapubic hair in 6 cases,suprapubic hair with enlarged clitoris in one case, suprapubic hair with huge intraabdominal swelling in one case and vaginal bleeding in one case. Tumor markers: AFP and HCG were negative in all cases.ultrasonography revealed unilateral solid ovarian tumors in 7 cases,huge ovarian swelling with mixed solid and cystic elements in one case and a small ovarian cyst in one case. Cases were treated as follows: unilateral oophorectomy in 8 cases and partial oophorectomy in one case.The histopathological study revealed benign granulosa cell tumors in all cases.Followup revealed regression of signs of pseudoprecocious puberty over a period ranged from 10 to 120 days. Conclusions: *Juvenile granulosa cell tumors should be considered in prepubertal girls with pseudoprecocious puberty and negative tumor markers (AFP & HCG), and differentiated from functioning germ cell tumors including ovarian carcinoma. *Unilateral oophorectomy is the curative treatment because they are mostly benign. P-285 Uveal Melanoma in Young Patients S. Saakyan 1 1Moscow Research Institute of Eye Disease, Ocular Oncology and Radiology, Moscow, Russia Background/Objectives: Purpose To analyze the clinical profile and survivability of young patients with uveal melanoma. Design/Methods: Retrospective casecontrol series. Out of 1224 patients with uveal melanoma treated in 20052015 there were 21 patients (1,7%) aged 20 and younger (15 male, 6 female). The mean age of those patients was 15,7\u00b10,5 years. In all cases the tumor was unilateral. All patients were examined with standard ophthalmological procedures, and also ultrasound Color Doppler Imaging, OCT and Fluorescein angiography. The tumors were treated ruthenium plaque brachyterapy (11 cases), transpupillary thermotherapy (2cases), proton beam therapy (2 cases) and enucleation (6 cases). Results: All patients were divided into 2 groups: with organ preservation treatment (71%) and without (29%). In the first group the mean tumor height was 4.8\u00b10.4 mm. In the second group 9.9\u00b10.4 mm, enucleation was performed in all cases. Case monitoring in the 1 group demonstrated the 100% 2year survivability and 90.9% 5year survivability vs 100% 1year and 83.3% 2year survivability in the 2 group. Conclusions: There was no increasing the incidence of uveal melanoma at young patients during the last years and the most common there were the medium and large tumor's sizes and they demonstrated good results of the local treatment. P-286 Overexpression of MIR4833P and MIR1493P IS Associated with Pediatrics, Preto, Brazil; 2Boldrini Children Center, Pediatrics, Campinas, Brazil Background/Objectives: Although childhood adrenocortical tumors (ACT) are rare neoplasms, its incidence in Brazil is particularly higher. Currently, there are no reliable biomarkers, which predict diagnosis or prognosis of ACT in children. Aiming to find potential biomarkers of ACT prognosis, we validated the expression of two miRNAs that were found differentially expressed in a microarraybased miRNA profiling conducted with 37 pediatric ACT samples Design/Methods: The validation of miR1493p and miR4833p expressions was evaluated by RTqPCR in 47 ACT pediatric tumors and 8 nonneoplastic adrenal pediatric samples. The comparison between miRNA profiles and clinical/biological features were performed by MannWhitney test and KaplanMeier curves with logrank test for Eventfree survival (EFS) analysis and relative risk (RR) and multivariate analysis by Cox Regression Model Results: The miR4833p was overexpressed in tumor samples (P<0.0001), which also showed significant association with virilizing tumors (P=0.002) and TP53 mutation p.R337H (P=0.042). The miR1493p expression was significantly higher in patients classified as Sandrini's stage IV (P=0.008), relapse/metastasis (P=0.006) and unfavorable event (P=0.021). Patients with expression levels higher than median of miR149 showed a lower 5years overexpression was an independent prognostic factor (P = 0.042) when analyzed in association with tumor size and advanced stage. Moreover, miR483 presented negative correlations with (Rho=0.47; P=0.005), an important of Wnt pathway Conclusions: We observed overexpression of miR4833p in ACT when compared to nonneoplastic samples. The higher expression of miR1493p in tumors seems to be related with poor prognosis of pediatric ACTs. Interestingly, both miRNAs showed significant and opposite correlations with genes of Wnt signaling, ptahway suggesting a possible relationship of these miRNAs with an essential pathway for adrenal development P-287 Aberrant PDGFR Signaling as a Target for Treatment of the Infantile Myofibromatosis with Sunitinib R. Veselska 1,2,3, Czech 2St. Anne's Hospital, International Clinical Research Center, Brno, Czech Republic; 3Masaryk University School of Sciences, Department of Experimental Biology, Brno, Czech Republic; 4Masaryk University School of Medicine, Department of Pediatric Oncology, Brno, Czech Republic; 5Masaryk University, CEITEC MU Center of Molecular Medicine, Brno, Czech Republic Background/Objectives: Infantile myofibromatosis (IM) belongs to the family of soft tissue tumors. Majority of them shows a benign behavior but resistant and malignant forms are also known. Although molecular mechanisms of the IM pathogenesis are not completely explained, some studies suggest the association of mutations in plateletderived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRb) gene and other related genes with this disease. Design/Methods: We analyzed in detail a primary IM cell line as well as fresh frozen tumor tissues from two siblings suffering with IM. Human phosphoprotein arrays were employed for detection of the phosphorylation status of 49 receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and of 24 mitogenactivated protein kinases (MAPKs) and other important downstream signaling proteins. Expression and phosphorylation of selected candidate proteins involved in PDGFR signaling was determined using immunoblotting. The wholeexome sequencing was used to uncover germinal and tumorspecific mutations in the signalingrelated genes. Results: Tumor samples from both siblings showed a relatively highest phosphorylation level of PDGFRb and ERK1/2 implicated overactivation of germline heterozygous c.1681C>A missense mutation of PDGFRB gene. Furthermore, the same germinal mutation in PTPRJ gene, which product specifically binds and dephosphorylates ERK1/2 kinases, were detected in both of siblings. Subsequent in vitro experiments using primary tumorderived cell line were focused on testing of different lowmolecularweight inhibitors to examine the cell viability and the responsiveness of the PDGFRb/MAPK signaling axis. The results showed that sunitinib, i.e. multitargeted RTK inhibitor, was able to inhibit PDGFRb but its effect on downstream MAPKs was a marginal only. Conclusions: According to the in vitro experiments, sunitinib represents a suitable treatment of IM. Uptodate, these results were verified by positive therapeutic response to the administration of sunitinib in both siblings.

Wang2 1Children's Hospital Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Department of Ultrasound, Hangzhou, China; 2Children's Hospital Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Department of Surgical Oncology, Hangzhou, China Background/Objectives: This study investigated the sonographic features of vaginal malignancies in girls and the efficacy of transperineal(TP) in conjunction with transabdominal (TA) ultrasonography in the diagnosis and followup of vaginal malignancies in girls. Design/Methods: Imaging data of 16 cases of vaginal malignancies in our center from January 2000 to December 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. Characteristics of ultrasonography, CT and MR were summarized. All cases confirmed by pathology. Patients aged form 3m7d to 6y. In this group, 10 cases were vaginal endodermal sinus tumors, 4 cases were embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas, one was nephroblastoma and one was metastatic neuroblastoma. All patients underwent transperineal(TP) in conjunction with transabdominal(TA) ultrasonography, some underwent CT and MR. Results: The results of transperineal and transabdominal ultrasonography. In the 16 cases, the pelvic hypoechoic masses could be shown by transabdominal ultrasonography. 4 cases combined intrauterine hematocele. However, it could be clearly display the size, border, blood flow of the vaginal hypoechoic occupancy, and the relationship of the occupancy and vagina by transperineal ultrasonography. There were no obvious necrotic liquefaction and calcification in the mass. During the followup process of 14 cases after chemotherapy, the vaginal tumor could not be clearly shown by transabdominal ultrasonography after the tumor shrinkage, while it still be clearly shown by transperineal ultrasonography. Ten cases underwent CT examination. Lesions appeared as similarcircular soft tissue masses with heterogeneous density, variable necrosis and cystic degeneration on unenhanced CT. Twelve cases underwent MR examination. Masses were uniformly isointense on T1weighted images, heterogeneously hyperintense on T2weighted images. Heterogeneous enhancement especially peripherally was noted on both CT and MRI contrastenhanced images. Conclusions: Vaginal malignancies often have characteristic echo pattens. Transperineal in conjunction with transabdominal ultrasonography are helpful in diagnosing and following up of vaginal malignancies.Therefore,ultrasound may be preferred as the initial investigation for cases of vaginal malignancy as it is a noninvasive,radiationfree,inexpensive technique. Solid Non Brain Tumours Histiocytosis P-289 Reduced Doses of Cladribine Plus or Reactivated Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH) M.F. Gutierrez 1, M. Urbieta1, Ramirez1, S. Acosta1, A. Oller1 1Hospital de Ni\u00f1os Ricardo Gutierrez, Oncology, Capital federal, Argentina Background/Objectives: Treatment with Cladibrine (2CDA) as single drug or with Cytarabine at higt doses (9 mg/m2/d and 1000 mg/m2/d for 5 days) has been effective in children with refractory or reactivated LCH after 2 or 3 previous treatment regimens OBJECTIVES: To describe our experience in reduced doses 2CDA plus Cytarabine scheme in refractory or reactivated patients(p) with LCH, follow up and acute toxicity. Design/Methods: Retrospective analysis of patients records treated between January 2008 and February 2017 with refractory o reactivated LCH after standard therapy. Patients received 2cda (5 mg / M2 daily for 5 days) +/ cytarabine (100 mg / m2 / day for 4 days). Courses were repeated every 34 weeks. Results: Fifty one patients with LCH were admitted during the indicated period, 7p were treated with 2CDA plus AraC, 1p with 2CDA alone. The median age at diagnosis was 24.57 months (range 3 to 180 months). All patients had multisystemic LCH at diagnosis. Four patients had risk organ involvement and 2 had SNC tumorous lesions. Median of previus chemotherapy schemes:2 (13). Seven of 8 patients were evaluables. One patient was excluded because of severe liver toxicity the first day of infusion (grade 3). A total 42 were performed. All patients received 6 courses. There were 7 admissions due to febrile neutropenia and 17 episodes of grade 34 haematological toxicity. Seven of seven patients present no active disease (NAD) after median follow up of 4,16 month (range 1.9 to 86.1 month). Conclusions: In our experience the treatment with reduced doses of cladribine +/ cytarabin for refractory or reactivated LCH patients was usefull to obtain and sustain NAD, with very tolerable toxicity. P-290 Multifocal Histiocytic Sarcoma in A 2 Year Old Child, Successfully Treated with Acute Myeloid Leukaemia Based Chemotherapy M. Madni 1, Background/Objectives: Histiocytic and dendritic cell neoplasms are rare malignant disorders originating from tissue macrophages/ histiocytes. The incidence is estimated as 0.05 per 100,000 per year in Europe. In the past, most of these disorders were misdiagnosed as lymphomas, especially diffuse large B cell lymphoma or anaplastic large cell lymphoma. However, after the WHO 2008 classification the diagnosis has been simplified. Historically, histiocytic sarcoma (HS) is associated with an unfavourable prognosis with no consensus on treatment strategy and most of the literature is available in the form of case reports with variable treatment protocols used with variable success. In most of the cases these tumours respond poorly to the treatment commonly used in Langerhan cell histiocytosis. Design/Methods: Case Report Results: We describe a 2 years old patient with multifocal HS. She presented with multiple soft tissue and bony lesions involving the maxilla and mandible with disease also present in abdomen, tibia and femur. Initial impression on histopathology favoured a myeloid malignancy and she was commenced on treatment according to AML 15 protocol. Ongoing Immunohistochemical investigation concluded the diagnosis of HS on the basis of positivity of CD68, CD163, and Lysozyme. After a good response to initial AML therapy and, in the knowledge that there is no optimum treatment strategy for HS we continued the same chemotherapy regimen. She is currently 23 months off treatment and maintaining clinical and radiological remission. Conclusions: We conclude that HS can be successfully treated with chemotherapy alone commonly used for Acute Myeloid Leukaemia without significant toxicity. P-291 Spectrum of Presentation, Management and Late-Effects of Langerhans Cell Histocytosis Over A 10Year Period, in a UK Tertiary Paediatric Oncology Centre A. Mitchell 1, U. Uparkar1, R. United Kingdom Background/Objectives: Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH) describes a clinical spectrum of disease caused by clonal proliferation of pathological Langerhan's cells infiltrating tissues. We aimed to characterise the disease presentations in the South of England to the Southampton Principal treatment centre (PTC) over the past 10 years due to clinical concern regarding increased incidence and complexity of clinical LCH presenting over recent years. Design/Methods: Retrospective data was collected on demographics, disease sites, treatment modalities at diagnosis/relapses, remission free periods and outcome at latest evaluation at followup. Results: 1041 children were treated for cancer at Southampton PTC over the past 10 years (1/1/200631/12/2016). 46 cases of LCH were identified, median age of 2 yrs 6 months accounting for 4.3% of our patients. Male:female ratio 1.2:1. 62% (28) presented with singlesystem disease and 38% (16) multisystem disease. 4 children were identified as having diabetes insipidus 8.7%. 78% of cases were biopsied. 2 cases of neurodegenerative LCH were identified. Majority (88%, 23/26) of children with single system disease had uncomplicated course, no further disease recurrence at last follow up. Unifocal bone disease was treated by curettage except one who was already resolving at time of review and therefore observed. multisystem (34%, 16 cases) patients had a more complicated course with 64% suffering a relapse (10/16) and 2/16 patients had at least 4 relapses needing salvage therapy. 15% of our overall cases had risk organ + disease. Conclusions: We present our centres experience with LCH over the past 10 years. We witnessed a spike in incidence of LCH in 2016 however further data is required to delineate a clear trend of increasing incidence. Novel strategies to evaluate and monitor BRAF in blood and urine such as those being employed in the latest international LCH IV trial offer the opportunity to better understand the risk factors for disease severity. P-292 Mortality Risk Factors of Children with Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis: A Prospective Study at Children's Hospital 1, HO CHI MINH, Vietnam T. Nguyen 1, A. Phan1, D. Tran1, C. Cao1 1Children's Hospital lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a lifethreatening hyperinflammatory condition. Whether primary or secondary, prompt initiation of HLH therapy is mandatory to prevent irreversible tissue damage. We identify risk factors of mortality of Vietnamese children with HLH who were treated by the HLH2004 protocol. Design/Methods: We conducted a prospective study between Jan 2009 to Dec 2011. The diagnosis of HLH at the Children's Hospital 1 in Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam was compatible with the diagnostic criteria of the HLH2004 proposed by the HLH Study Group of the Histiocyte Society, and patients who fulfilled at least five of the following signs or laboratory findings were enrolled: fever (higher than 38\u00b0C for more than 7 days), splenomegaly or hepatomegaly, cytopenia (affecting 2 of three lineages and hemophagocytosis in bone marrow or lymph nodes. Results: A total of 144 patients, median age 2.5 years (range 0.115 years) with a male:female ratio of 1.6:1 were enrolled into the study. All patients were treated with the HLH2004 protocol and had a median time from diagnosis to treatment of 2 days (range 06days). The overall 5years survival rate was 70.1\u00b15.3% with a median followup of 5.4 years. Of all patients, 64 (44.4%) achieved complete resolution, 16 (11.1%) had active disease, 21 (14.6%) developed reactivation and 43 (29.9%) died. Factors independently associated with mortality included persistent elevated ferritin levels (OR=5.5, 95% CI=4.36.2), central nervous induction therapy (OR=2.8, 95% CI=2.23.4). Conclusions: Early diagnosis and prompt management of HLH in children with a close followup of mortality risks factors can improve patient survival. P-293 Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis: A Single Center Experience of 92 Cases A. Raj 1, A. Batra1, S. Bakhshi1, B. Biswas1 1MRO Ward Institute Rotary Cancer Hospital AIIMS, Medical Onology Department, New Delhi, India Background/Objectives: Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare disease. Limited data has been published from India regarding longterm outcomes. Design/Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients with LCH treated at Institute Rotary Cancer Hospital, New Delhi from August 2002January 2017. Results: Ninetytwo patients were registered during August 2002January 2017. Median age was 3 years, with male: female ratio of 7:3. Median time from symptoms to diagnosis was 6 months. Bony swellings (61.5%), fever (37.3%) and skin rash (27.8%) were most common presenting complaints. Bony lytic lesions, anemia, lung involvement, jaundice, bone marrow involvement were seen in 84%, 52%, 11.2%, 8.9% and 6.7% of patients, respectively. Patients were divided into three risk categories [A - multifocal/unifocal bone only (28.7%) B - Soft tissue involvement with no organ dysfunction (42.5%), C - Organ Dysfunction (28.8%)]. The patients were treated with DALHX83 protocol (prednisolone, vinblastine, etoposide, 6Mercaptopurine). Response assessment was done at 12 week, end of treatment and suspected disease progression. Eightynine of 92 patients received firstline treatment. Complete response (CR) was observed in 15.3%, partial response or stable disease (PR/SD) 72.1%, whereas 12.6% had disease progression at 12 weeks of therapy. Thirtythree patients progressed among whom 29 took secondline treatment. Prednisolone, vinblastine and etoposide or cladribine were used in secondline treatment. The CR to 2nd line therapy was 23%. Progression free survival (PFS) at 60 months was 59.1% [95% CI: 0.460.70] and overall survival (OS) at was 92.8% [95% CI: (p=0.03) were significant predictors of PFS. Conclusions: This is the largest Indian series of LCH with outcome results comparable to western population with a 5year PFS of 59.1% and 10 year OS of V600E Mutation in Pediatric Shuangshot2 Thailand; 2Chulalongkorn University, Pathology, Bangkok, Thailand; 3Hospital for Sick Children and University of Toronto, Laboratory Medicine, Toronto, Canada Background/Objectives: Juvenile xanthogranuloma (JXG) is a rare primarily pediatric nonLangerhans cell histiocytosis (nonLCH). BRAF V600E mutation is observed in approximately 60% of LCH. In addition, the mutation has recently been identified in 54 % of ErdheimChester disease (ECD) but none in other nonLCH lesions. Design/Methods: Retrospectively reviewed. Results: Patient # 1 presented with headache and recurrent vomiting. MRI of the brain revealed multiple intracranial extraaxial masses. A biopsy of the right temporal lesion was originally reported as JXG. The lesion was found to have a BRAF mutation by BRAF immunohistochemistry, with subsequent confirmation by molecular methods. Patient #2 developed intractable seizures at the time of diagnosis. A cerebellar lesion was identified and a biopsy of this was originally diagnosed as RosaiDorfman disease (RDD) on the basis of the immunohistochemical profile, although the lesion did not show all the typical features of RDD. Patient #3 was brought to medical attention due to bilateral proptosis and multiple cranial lesions. A biopsy of the right parietal bone lesion was reported as JXG. Bone marrow study, bone scintigraphy and imaging of the chest and abdomen were performed in all patients and there was no evidence of extracranial disease involvement in any of the patients. Patients #2 and #3 received intuitional chemotherapy regimen for LCH that consisted of vinblastine, prednisolone, cytarabine, 6mercaptopurine and methotrexate for a total of 46 weeks. All three patients underwent radiotherapy to the primary affected site with varying doses of radiation. At the median follow up time of 20 months, all patients are alive with partial to complete disease response. Conclusions: In our report, we detected BRAF V600E mutation in all 3 JXG patients with indolent presentation. Targeted BRAF inhibitor may have a potential role in refractory JXG cases with this mutation. Further study of BRAF status in a lager series of JXG is warranted. Brain Tumours P-295 Medulloblastoma, Treatment Outcome and Prognostic Factors at National Cancer Institute, Egypt \"2008 - 2013\" A. Mustafa 1,2, N. Ali1,2, R. Cancer Institute, Pediatric Oncology, Cairo, Egypt; 2Nci Children Cancer Hospital Egypt, Pediatric Oncology, Cairo, Egypt Background/Objectives: Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant brain tumor of childhood. It occurs at all ages, peaking in incidence between 4 and 7 years. Our aim was to assess the outcome and prognostic factors among MB pediatric patients at the National Cancer Institute, Cairo University. Design/Methods: This is a retrospective study included 53 eligible patients with established diagnosis of medulloblastoma during the period from January 2008 to December 2013. Results: Among the 53 patients, 31 were males (58.5%). Median age at diagnosis was 6 years (range 0.618 years). Vomiting was the most frequent presenting symptom followed by headache detected in 90.6% and 86.8% of patients, respectively. The majority of our patients were high risk 45 patients (84.9%) (15% of them infantile 3 years), while 8 patients (15.1%) were standard risk. Median follow up period was 38.6 months (range 13.3 to 81.9). The 5year overall survival (OS) and progressionfree survival (PFS) rates were 54.6% and 74.8%, respectively. The presence of postoperative residual, spinal seedling, M staging, and completing chemotherapy protocol had a significant difference regarding survival rate (p=0.045, p<0.001, p=0.021 & p<0.001, respectively). There was no significant difference between patients presented at age 3 years versus >3 years old regarding survival rate (5year OS 50.0% versus 55.2%, respectively), also histopathological subtypes had no impact on survival (p=0.099). At the end of this study 29 patients (54.7%) were alive, 22 patients (41.5%) were dead and 2 patients (3.8%) lost follow up. Two out of 53 patients relapsed after treatment. Conclusions: The outcome of patients in this study is favorable and comparable to international trials. Patients with advanced stages and incomplete surgical resection had a poorer outcome. Most of mortalities were caused by infection and sepsis, raising the importance of strict infection control and strong supportive care measures. P-296 Evaluation of Prognostic Factors for Patients E. Bouffet1 highly lethal embryonal brain tumours that occur in children predominantly younger than three years old. Recent studies have led to advancements in treatment stratification based on (epi)genomic and transcriptional profiling, however, prognosis despite aggressive chemotherapy remains poor for most patients. Design/Methods: We performed a systematic metaanalysis of the literature comparing treatment strategies of ATRT patients diagnosed from 19902016. Treatment information including chemotherapy, radiation and surgery, and clinical information such as age and tumour location was curated for 409 patients. We sub classified chemotherapy regimens by chemical class, and also evaluated the effect of specific delivery methods such as intrathecal (IT) and highdose chemotherapy (HDCT). Multivariate COX regression and survival analyses were performed to assess the efficacy of different treatment strategies. Results: Of the patients analyzed, 66% received either focal or whole brain and spine radiation. IT and HDCT was administered to only 35% and 34% of patients respectively. Most reports collected were reported post 2004 (88%). Patients were treated heterogeneously with different protocols that resulted in different clinical outcomes. Multivariate COX regression analyses reveal statistically significant differences in various treatment strategies and chemotherapeutic agents according to certain patient characteristics such as age and tumour location. Conclusions: Our results strongly indicate that patient's clinical demographics significantly influence treatment success, and that some chemical classes of drugs may not benefit all types of ATRT. A personalized approach taking into account patient age, tumour location, and molecular subtype will be required in order to tailor treatment strategies appropriately.

Primarily occur in children under the age of three though they may be seen in older age groups. Design/Methods: Medical charts of pediatric patients diagnosed with ATRT between 19932013 at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, were reviewed and treatment profile and outcome data were analyzed. Results: Forty three cases were evaluated. Median age at diagnosis among males (n=23, 53.5%) was 1.8 years (0.0320.7) compared to 2.1 years (0.1720.1) among females (n=20, 46.5%). All patients biopsy gross total resection (GTR). VPshunt was inserted in 9 patients prior to surgery and in 17 after surgery. All but one tumor were immunonegative for INI 1. Disease was localized in 65.1% (28) and disseminated in 34.9% (15). Rhabdomyosarcoma based chemotherapy was given to 30 (68.9%) patients. Nineteen patients received radical dose of radiation therapy. Eight patients received focal irradiation while 11 had whole craniospinal axis irradiation followed by localized boost to primary lesion. Patients treated with focal radiation only, had no clinical, radiological or cytological evidence of spinal seeding. Total radiation dose for localized field ranged from 5050.4 Gy in 2832 fractions, while the craniospinal axis radiation dose ranged from 30.6 Gy to 36 Gy. At last followup, 22(51.2%) patients were alive; 2(9.1%) in CR, 5(22.7%) with SD and the remaining 15(68.2%) had disease progression (PD). Median followup of 25.1 months, the probability of five year overall survival was 31%, having a median survival time of 19 months (95% CI: 5.632.4). Conclusions: ATRT outcome utilizing agents mimicking effects of INI1/ h SNF5 may hold promise in future studies for this aggressive tumor. P-298 Excellent NeuroCognitive Outcomes in Infant Patients with Medulloblastoma Treated with PostOperative Chemotherapy and Focal Radiation P. Angelini 1, A. Michalski1, Phipps2, D. United Kingdom; 3Great Street Hospital, Neurosciences, London, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: Infant medulloblastoma patients suffer severe cognitive sequelae from conventional treatment, particularly from radiotherapy. We present the results of a protocol comprising doseintense induction chemotherapy, focal radiotherapy and consolidation chemotherapy, and the neurocognitive outcome of survivors. Design/Methods: Twentysix patients were treated between 11/1997 and 04/2011. All patients underwent an attempt at surgical resection, followed by induction chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, carboplatin, vincristine). Radiotherapy was administered based on initial staging and tumour response. Post radiotherapy the patients received 4 cycles of consolidation chemotherapy (lomustine, cisplatin, vincristine). Results: Nineteen patients received radiotherapy, OS was 56.8% \u00b1 10.5%. EFS was 51.1% \u00b110.2%. Twelve patients relapsed, 13 died, 11 are long term survivors and two are lost to followup. Gross tumour resection, desmoplastic variant and radiotherapy (either focal or CSI) correlated with better OS and EFS, while metastases, gender and age at diagnosis had no impact. Twelve of 13 evaluable patients reported one or more long term sequelae of their tumour or treatment. Fourteen patients, including all longterm survivors, had a neuropsychological or developmental assessment 2 to 10 years after the diagnosis. Six had learning difficulties (42%), of whom three (female), had moderate learning difficulties, and three (boys) had severe learning disabilities. 2 children had language difficulties, one with average cognition. Six patients had normal IQ between 89 and 113 and no other problems. Conclusions: Our study confirms that 1: patients with desmoplastic medulloblastoma have a favourable prognosis and 2: delaying radiotherapy and reducing the field of radiation lead to normal neurocognitive outcome in 42%, and mild deficits in 21% of survivors. However, the report of 4 second malignancies (28.6% of nonrelapsed patients) is of concern and brings into question the whole approach with chemoradiotherapy for these tumours. P-299 The Promote Study: Patient Reported Outcome Measures Online to Enhance Communication and Quality of Life after Childhood Brain Tumour - Systematic Review K. Bull 1, C. Kennedy1, S. Hornsey2, J. Shepherd3, K. Welch3, C. Morris4 Sciences, United of 4University of Exeter, Medical School, Exeter, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: Quality of life in children treated for brain tumours is at risk of being significantly impaired into adulthood including cognitive functioning, emotional, behavioural, and social issues. However, typically there is no systematic screening for such problems. Referral to appropriate services is often reactive rather than proactive. We are testing the feasibility of individualised application of patientreported outcome measures (PROMs) to improve communication in outpatient consultations. We need to select appropriate PROMs based on available evidence of measurement properties. Design/Methods: We have conducted a systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO to identify evidence of studies evaluating measurement properties of English language versions of PROMs suitable for use with children who have been treated for brain tumours. Two reviewers have independently screened all titles and abstracts from the search to select those articles that are likely to yield relevant results. Full texts are being extracted from this list and read by 3 reviewers to confirm their relevance and ascertain their contribution to the evidence base. The review team will then consider the evidence and decide on the extent to which each PROM can be considered robust for measuring quality of life in individual children treated for brain tumours. Results: After duplicates had been removed, the systematic search identified 473 possible relevant studies in which PROMs had been psychometrically evaluated for use with children treated for brain tumours. To date 53 (21%) studies from 250 titles and abstracts screened have been included for the next stage in the review process. Conclusions: We will present evidence from this review that informs the selection of PROMs for use with children treated for brain tumours in a subsequent stage of the research for which decisions on the final selection of PROMs will be made in consultation with families and clinicians. P-300 In Human Glioblastoma Cell Lines, Doxycycin Inhibits Tumorigenicity by Tumor Stem Glioblastoma multiforme still is a lethal diagnosis for most patients. Operation and radiotherapy are very effective to reduce the tumor burden, however, a strong adjuvant therapy is lacking. Based on the cancer stem cell hypothesis, we expected an increased tumorigenicity in stemlike glioblastoma cells. Our objective was then to analyse how this might be influenced by different culture conditions in vitro in cell lines established from individual patients, in order to identify therapeutic targets acting on epigenetic regulation. Since continuous exposure to temozolomide is part of standard treatment, its effect on stemness was analysed. Doxycycline is a polycyclic antibiotic, inhibiting protein biosynthesis by binding to the small subunit (30S) of bacterial ribosomes. Since it acts similarly on the 28S subunit of mitochondrial ribosomes, which could be a critical part in the metabolism of stemlike cells it might also inhibit stem cell formation. Design/Methods: Patient derived cells were grown in classical cell culture (with 10% fetal calf serum) and cancer stem cell culture (serum free, supplemented with growth factors), both as adherent or spheroid culture. In these settings, we analysed the effect of continuous treatment with the cytostatic drug temozolomide (50M), without and with doxycycline. Results: As we found, cells cultivated upon stem cell culture conditions displayed an increased tumorigenicity in vitro, as compared to their respective serum culture counterparts. Cells cultivated as spheroids achieved a more stemlike phenotype than adherent cells. Interestingly, similar effects were observed after treatment with temozolomide (50M). Furrther, doxycylin was studied it in our temozolomideinduced tumorigenicity model. In fact, it reversed the effects of temozolomide. Conclusions: In summary, we found that by numerous modifications of growth conditions, the stemlike phenotype and tumorigenicity of glioblastoma cells may be influenced, thus opening new options for a targeted approach in glioblastoma therapy. P-301 Application of VisualMotor Exerciser in Children and Teenagers After Antitumor Therapy of Central Nervous System Cancer V. Anisimov1, A. Dreneva 1, I. Borodina1, V. Kasatkin1 1Dmitry Research Center of Pediatric Hematology Oncology and Immunology, Clinical Rehabilitation Research Center for patients in remission \"Russkoye pole\", Moscow, Russia Background/Objectives: The progress of treatment in children with brain tumors has led to a significant increase in their survival. However, radiotherapy and chemotherapy produce dramatic impact on survivors' health state. Hence, the question of effective cognitive and motor rehabilitation of survivors is in a great interest. The aim of our research was to study the applicability of a new method for motor and executive functions development and to evaluate its effectiveness in relation to rehabilitation therapy in patients with brain tumors. Design/Methods: The cohort included 46 children with posterior fossa tumors: 27 males and 19 Depending on treatment protocol, 11 patients received surgery, 3 patients received surgery and radiotherapy, 1 patient received surgery and chemotherapy, and 31 patients received all three types of intervention. Remission period varied from 2 to 113 months (median=21). All patients received occupational therapy consisted of 57 sessions at Dynavision D2 \u00ae. This training device is designed for the enhancement of visualmotor integration and attention skills. Results: Our findings revealed significant improvement of reaction time in all patients (P<0.0126). Females showed better performance (P<0.0001) that can be explained by earlier psychomotor maturation in girls. The group of patients who received only surgical intervention demonstrated better results comparing to others (P<0.0313). Performance scores significantly correlated with ophthalmological diagnoses (P<0.00001). No significant age differences were found. No negative feedback was received from patients during the time they were working with the device. Conclusions: The results suggest that Dynavision D2 \u00ae can be successfully applied to training of reaction time, visualmotor integration and handeye coordination in rehabilitation of pediatric cancer survivors. P-302 Executive Functions State in Childhood Brain Tumor Survivors before and After Working Memory and Attention Training A. Ryabova1, A. Dreneva 1, A. Aizenshtein1, V. Kasatkin1 1Dmitry Research Center of Pediatric Hematology Oncology and Immunology, Clinical Rehabilitation Research Center for patients in remission \"Russkoye pole\", Moscow, Russia Background/Objectives: Childhood brain tumors and their treatments are closely associated with cognitive impairment that occurs in a substantial proportion of patients. The aim of the investigation was to evaluate the impact of rehabilitation therapy, which included executive functions training, on such parameters as working memory, sustained attention and processing speed, in posterior fossa tumor survivors. Design/Methods: Thirtyone children (20 boys, 11 girls, median age=11) were The functions training was performed in all patients during threeweek time period. The state of executive functions before and after the training was evaluated by Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB \u00ae). Results: Most of patients demonstrated significant improvement in spatial working memory capacity (P<0.0087) and delayed pattern recognition (P<0.0325). An increasing tendency was revealed for ability to manipulate visuospatial information (P<0.0743) and for immediate pattern recognition (P<0.0839). Conclusions: The results indicate the effectiveness of executive functions training in childhood brain tumor patients. They also show that CANTAB \u00ae is a sensitive method for neuropsychological assessment in pediatric cancer survivors. P-303 Prognostic Significance of Molecular Grouping in Russian Cohort of Medulloblastoma Patients L. Papusha1, A. Druy 2, L. Yasko3, G.

Design/Methods: In the pilot study aimed to investigate clinical significance of molecular grouping of medulloblastoma in Russian cohort of patients we analyzed profile of 26 genes expression (P. Northcott et al. 2012 with slight modifications) in 33 FFPE tumor samples from patients 015 years of age by Nanostring technology. All patients were treated according to HIT protocol. Median of followup time achieved 23.3 months. Results: 8 patients had metastatic dissemination and 8 had incomplete resection with residual disease larger then 1.5 cm2. Molecular group distribution was as follow: WNT 2, SHH 9, group 3 11, group 4 11 patients. Classical histologic variant of medulloblastoma included all groups with the exception of SHH, anaplastic - only group 3. Correspondence of desmoplastic/nodular histology to SHH group was 7/8 in infants; however in patients >3 years desmoplastic medulloblastoma belonged to group 3 and 4 (2 and 3 patients respectively). All 8 infants with desmoplastic variant were treated only by chemotherapy (HIT SKK) and had excellent outcome, even in cases with metastatic disease. Group 3 patients had poor outcome: eventfree survival (EFS) was 0.42\u00b10.16. 3 out of 11 patients did not respond to the firstline therapy and 3 had a relapse. Group 4 and WNT patients in our series had excellent outcome. In the group 4 all patients with the exception of one were above 3 years of age and received craniospinal irradiation. Differences in EFS between molecular subgroups were significant, pvalue for trend was 0.007. Conclusions: Our study confirmed the prognostic significance of molecular grouping of medulloblastoma. Nanostring is fast and reliable method for this purpose and could be offered for routine clinical practice. P-304 Experience of the Management of Central Nervous System Tumors in Children Younger than 5 YearsOld in the Last 15 Years M. GarciaAriza 1, R. A. A. Garcia Rives2, Valduvieco3, Unit, Cruces Bilbao, Spain Background/Objectives: Treatment of young children with central nervous system (CNS) tumors remains a challenge. The objective of avoiding radiation therapy due to its long term sequelae, and the controversy about the highdose chemotherapy (HDCT) difficult the management of these patients. We present our experience in children with CNS tumors less than five years. Design/Methods: Review of the CNS tumors in children under five years diagnosed from 2001 to 2016. Collected and analyzed data were clinical, histological, treatment and sequelae. Results: Sixtythree infants were identified. Males sites opticpathway gliomas, DIPG and a hypophysis tumor. Chemotherapy was administered in 56%, 23% beyond the first line, and HDCT 6%. 19 (30%), and ependymoma above 3.5 yearsold). Observation without therapy in 7 cases, predominantly lowgrade gliomas. Overall survival 63.5% with median followup of 62 months (range30109). Most frequent sequelae were neurological (70%) and ophthalmological (52%). Three cases presented no sequelae. Conclusions: The management of children less than fiveyears with CNS tumors remains challenge. We should consider carefully age, histology and localization for therapeutic decisions. Chemotherapy was administered in most cases (56%) and may contribute to the delay of RT in some patients. The role of HDCT in young children needs to be analyzed in larger studies. In survivors, the tumor and treatment sequelae were frequent and important. P-305 Congenital Giant Cell Astrocytomas A Comprehensive Clinical, Histopathological and Molecular Evaluation W. Grajkowska 1, K. Kotulska2, M. Roszkowski3, E. Jurkiewicz4, Institute, Neurology Background/Objectives: Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) is a brain tumor associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). It usually grows in a second decade of life, but may develop in the first months of life. The aim of this work was to establish the incidence, clinical, histopathological and molecular features, as well as outcome of congenital SEGA in TSC patients. Design/Methods: Cohort of 510 TSC patients was reviewed to identify cases with growing or hydrocephalus producing SEGAs in the first three months of life. Clinical presentation, size of the tumor, growth rate, histopahological and mutational analysis, treatment applied, as well as outcome were evaluated. Results: Twelve patients (2.4%) presented with SEGA in the first three months of life. All of them had documented SEGA growth and all developed hydrocephalus. In nine patients, mutational analysis was done, and in all of them, TSC2 gene mutations were identified. Mean maximum SEGA diameter at baseline was 50 mm. Seven patients underwent SEGA surgery and surgery related complications were observed in 57.1 % cases. Two patient received everolimus as a primary treatment. Conclusions: Congenital SEGA develops 2.4% of TSC patients. Patients with TSC2 mutations, and especially with TSC2/PKD1 mutations, are more prone to develop SEGA earlier in childhood and should be screened for SEGA from birth. In young infants with SEGA, both surgery and mTOR inhibitor should be considered as a treatment option.

P-306 Demography and Treatment of Craniopharyngioma in a Tertiary Centre in India S. Gupta 1, H. K P1 1All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Radiotherapy, New Delhi, India Background/Objectives: Craniopharyngioma are rare tumors of the sellar region. Data on demographic details, symptomatology, treatment and response is limited from the Indian subcontinent. Design/Methods: Patients included in the retrospective analysis were those who presented to the neurooncology clinic under radiation oncology department after surgery between years 2003 and 2016. The treatment charts were reviewed. This is an update of data from our institution. Results: A total of 54 patients were treated. Age of presentation ranged from 2 to 45 years.The sex distribution was Male:Female of 38:16. The presenting symptom was visual symptoms in 34 patients, hormonal imbalance in 3, neurological deficit in 1 patient, seizures in 1 patient and raised intracranial tension in 15 patients. Lesion size was< 4 cm for 32 patients and > 4 cm for 22 patients. Baseline TSH levels were available for 34 patients (Raised - 1; Decreased - 3). Baseline GH levels were available for 32 patients(Raised - 0; Decreased - 3). Baseline prolactin levels were available for 29 patients (Raised - 3; Decreased - 1). Baseline ACTH levels were available for 32 patients (Raised - 1; Decreased - 6). Radiation was delivered by 3 D CRT in 41 patients. IMRT in 2 patients and SRT in 1 patient. Radiation dose was 50.4 Gray in 28 fractions to 55 Gray over 5.5 to 6 weeks.36 patients had a complete response, 5 patients a partial response. 2 stable disease and 1 progressive disease. 7 patients recurred at local site. 6 patients underwent surgery. 4 of those patients had progressive disease at last follow up. No grade 3 or 4 toxicity was documented. Univariate analysis done on available data did not detect any association of age, sex, hormonal perturbations or lesion size with response to primary therapy or recurrence. Conclusions: Craniopharyngioma have good response to surgery with radiation P-307 SFCE Metro 01 FourDrug Metronomic Regimen has Pharmacy, Marseille, France Background/Objectives: To investigate the antitumour activity of a 4drug metronomic regimen in relapsing/refractory pediatric brain tumours (BT) as defined as progressionfree survival (PFS) after 2 cycles (4 months) of therapy. Design/Methods: Patients of 4 to 25 years of age with progressing BT and adequate organ function. Treatment consisted of an 8week cycle of oral celecoxib BID daily (D1D56), 100/200/400 mg according to BW, vinblastine 3 mg/m2, oral cyclophosphamide 30 mg/m2/d qd for 3 weeks alternating with oral methotrexate 10 mg/m2 twice a week for 3 weeks, with a 2week rest period. Maximum treatment was 2 years. Kepner and Chang twosteps model was used with 10 patients in the first stage. If primary objective was reached in 2 or more patients, 8 additional patients were recruited. This regimen was considered efficacious if PFS after 2 cycles was over 34% (alpha 10%, beta 10%). Results: 29 patients were 2 groups: ependymoma (N=8) and other BT:3 medulloblastoma (MB), 5 high grade glioma (HGG) (2 of which DPIG), 11 low grade glioma (LGG), 2 other. One patient with HGG stabilized for 2 years and one ependymoma stabilized 4 months. None of the other HGG, ependymoma or MB stabilized. Of the patients with LGG, median age was 9,5 years, median duration of illness 6,5 years and 10 patients received vinblastine previously. 1 PR was observed, 8 SD, 1 PD, one non evaluable after 2 cycles. Median number of cycles was 6 (range 1 to 12). Seven patients received at least 1 year of therapy. Treatment was interrupted temporarily in 5 patients for grade 3/4 toxicity. Conclusions: This metronomic regimen is active in patients with other BT, especially LGG, even if patients had received vinblastine previously.

He1 1Guang Zhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Institute of Pediatrics, Guangzhou, China; 2Guangzhou Institute of Pediatrics, Pediatrics Department, Guangzhou, China; 3Higuchi Bioscience Center, Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Kansas, USA Background/Objectives: Despite aggressive therapies, including combinations of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, GBM remains a highly aggressive brain cancer with the worst prognosis of any central nervous system disease; the median postdiagnostic survival period of GBM patient is approximately one year. Temozolomid (TMZ) first line chemotherapy drug for GBM, commonly use in the adjunctive treatment of gliomas and extends median survival from 12.1 months to 14.6 months but eventually chemotherapy becomes impaired by development of chemoresistance. MitophagyThe targeted degradation of unneeded and dysfunctional mitochondria, deregulation have been linked to human cancer. Mitophagy related stress tolerance can enable cell survival by maintaining energy production that can lead to tumor growth and therapeutic resistance. Objectives: To investigate whether TMZ can induce mitophagy in GBM cell lines. Design/Methods: Glioblstoma resistance cell lines T98G, U251 and U138 were treated with TMZ at different time intervals to induce mitophagy. Confocal Microscopy and Flow Cytometery were used to monitor Mitophagy. Results: Membrane potential (m) results depicted that U251 and U138 showed no loss of m at 12h but a significant loss of m were observed at 24h and 36h. T98G cell line showed no loss of m at 24h but showed comparatively higher loss of m at 36h and 48h. ROS assay results depicted that U138 cells showed slightly higher ROS positive cells in treated cells than control and similar results were observed in U251. In T98G a very significant difference were observed at 36h in treated cells than control compare to 24h and 48h. Conclusions: This study presents that TMZ could induce mitochondrial membrane potential decreased and ROS level increase in GBM cell lines so on the basis of our results we speculated that TMZ resistance may correlated to mitophagy. Further study is needed to explore the mitophagy mechanism in GBM TMZ resistance. P-309 Childhood Medulloblastoma: SingleCenter Experience of 16 Years in Peru L. Vasquez1, C. Alvarez2, E. leon 1 1Hospital Lima, Peru Background/Objectives: Medulloblastoma is an embryonal tumor with aggressive behavior and is more commonly seen in children than adults. The aim of this study was to determine epidemiological and treatment patterns and implications for survival in children with medulloblastoma. Design/Methods: A total of 67 patients younger than 18 years diagnosed with medulloblastoma from January 2002 to December 2016 were evaluated in a retrospective cohort in our institution. Prognostic Factors such as age, risk, surgery, metastates, leptomeningeal dissemination, time to delay of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy were analyzed. Results: The median followup time was 18.5 months (range 1146 months). In patients with HighRisk disease, 2 and 5year overall survival (OS) rates were 71.5% and 58.5%, and Disease Free Survival (DFS) were 53.7% and 33.5%, respectively. In patients with standardrisk disease, 2 and 5year OS and DFS rates were 50.5%, 34.4% and 36.3%, 19.9%, respectively. Median duration of symptoms was 31.5 days (range, 0120). Seventyone percent of patients presented in Stage 0 and had a localized tumor. Thirtyeight patients received radiation postsurgery (all of them had more than 3 years) by craniospinal irradiation up to 36 gray followed by boost up to 54 gray. Median time to radiation was 39 days (range, 22120). In multivariate analysis, group risk was an independent prognostic factor for OS along with metastatic disease, risk and positive CSF. A delayed start of radiation therapy (>42 days) was associated to inferior OS (p=0.0186). Conclusions: In children older than 3 years, a delayed radiation start after surgery was significant factor for unfavorable prognosis. Early treatment, in addition to a quickly diagnosis, is the key to management of medulloblastoma, which still needs to be achieved.

Department of Neurosurgery 1, Moscow, Russia Background/Objectives: According to data of some international pediatric protocols there were revealed markers of unfavorable outcome (CMYC/NMYC gene amplification, iso17q (Group3)), but expression of drug resistance proteins in tumor specimens is unknown. The aim of this study was to estimate ERCC1, TOP2a, RFC1, TUBB3 RFC1 and MGMT specimen was defined as weak (+), moderate (++), strong (+++) colouring of the tumor nuclei and cytoplasm (for ERCC1 and MGMT), nuclei (for TUBB3) with number of positive tumor cells above 10% (for ERCC1 and TUBB3), 25% (for MGMT). TOP2a and RFC1 positive specimen was defined as moderate (++), strong (+++) colouring of the tumor nuclei and cytoplasm (for TOP2a), membrane (for RFC1) with number of positive tumor cells above 25%. Results: ERCC1 positive samples were revealed in 18 out of 31 samples (58%; 66.7% for infants, 54.5% for children, p = 0.535), TOP2a in 13 out of 31 (41.9%; 33.3% for infants, 45.5% for children, p = 0.535), RFC1 in 9 out of 33 (27.2%; 0% for infants, 37.5% for children, p = 0.031), TUBB3 in 18 out of 26 (69%) and MGMT in 23 out of 37 (62%, 44.4% for infants, 67.8% for children, p = 0.208). There was also determined significant correlation between TOP2a positive specimen and molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma (33.3% for SHH, 100% for Group 3 and 20% for Group 4, p = 0.025). Conclusions: These data suggest that absence RFC1 expression in infant's medulloblastoma specimen could decrease effectiveness of methotrexate in this group.

Department of Neurosurgery 1, Moscow, Russia Background/Objectives: The aim of this study was to estimate expression of cytokineassociated proteins (VEGF, VEGFR1, specimens. Design/Methods: These proteins expression as: weak (+), moderate (++), strong (+++) colouring of the membrane and cytoplasm of positive tumor cells above 25%. Results: There was no estimated VEGF positive specimens within this group (0 out of 26). VEGFR1, VEGFR2 positive samples were revealed in 10 out of 26 samples (38.4%), PDGFRb in 9 out of 27 (33.3%), GCSFR in 24 out of 37 (64.5%), pSTAT3tyr705 in 9 out of 39 (23%) and CMYC in 2 (both with CMYC amplification) out of 8 (25%, only in Group 3). pSTAT3tyr705 positive specimens were presented in patients with M0 status in 8 out of 26 (30.8%), with M1 in 1 out of 13 (7.7%), predominantly with SHH medulloblastoma in 5 out of 15 (33,3%). GCSFR positive specimens were presented in patients with M0 status in 18 out of 25 (72%), with M1 in 6 out of 12 (50%), predominantly with SHH (10 out of 15 - 66.7%) and Group 4 medulloblastoma (8 out of 11 - 72.7%). There was not determined significant correlation between positive specimens and age groups (infants and children), CMYC/NMYC amplification, iso17q. Conclusions: These data suggest that childhood medulloblastoma is characterized by low activity of autocrine mechanism stimulation VEGF/VEGFR and PDGFRdependent signal pathway, decreased level of transcription factors (excluding variants with CMYC amplification) and high activity of GCSFRdependent signal pathway. P-312 A 40Year MultiInstitutional Review of Intracranial Germ Cell Tumours in Adolescents and Young Adults A. Lo 1,2,3,4, N. Laperriere3,4, D. Hodgson3,4, J. Dang4, P. Bedard10,11, K. 1British Columbia Cancer Agency, Radiation Therapy, Vancouver, Canada; 2University of British Columbia, Surgery, Vancouver, Canada; 3University of Toronto, Radiation Oncology, Toronto, Canada; 4Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Radiation Medicine Program, Toronto, Canada; 5The Hospital for Sick Children, Hematology/Oncology, Toronto, Columbia Hospital, Neurology, Centre, Hematology/Oncology, Toronto, Canada; 11University of Toronto, Medicine, Toronto, Canada Background/Objectives: The study aim was to determine the outcomes and complications of intracranial germ cell tumours (IGCT) in adolescents and young adults (AYA) according to different therapeutic approaches. Design/Methods: Onehundred ten patients with IGCT aged 15-39 were managed at either Princess Margaret Cancer Centre or British Columbia Cancer Agency from 1975-2015. The charts of these patients were retrospectively reviewed. KaplanMeier analyses were performed to calculate outcomes and complication rates at 10 years after treatment. Results: Median duration of followup was 9.3 years. Ninety patients had germinomas, and 20 had nongerminomatous germ cell tumours (NGGCT). Thirteen patients (12%) presented with spinal metastatic disease. Progressionfree survival (PFS) was 82% and overall survival (OS) was 87%. For patients with germinoma, PFS was 91% after craniospinal therapy 100% whole ventricular RT CSRT alone (N=43), and 91%, 5% disorder, 2% second neoplasms, 1% cerebrovascular events, and 1% visual deterioration. Treatmentinduced hearing loss or tinnitus was 10% after RT alone, and 28% after both chemotherapy and RT. Neurocognitive impairment from either disease or treatment was 43% after or Conclusions: We demonstrate excellent overall outcomes in the largest study of IGCT in AYA to our knowledge. High relapse rates were observed after nonCSRT without chemotherapy in germinoma, and after TBRT with chemotherapy in NGGCT.

Mehmood 1 1Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Radiation Oncology, Lahore, Pakistan Background/Objectives: We retrospectively examined the incidence, outcomes by treatment type, especially use of radiotherapy of medulloblastoma patients from 2001 to 2010. Design/Methods: The outcomes according to treatment, 5year groups (20012005, 20062010) M status, gender, age, and use of radiotherapy in first line treatment are presented. Results: 76 patients were treated over 10 years, 40 male and 36 female. 44 patients had M0 disease and 32 had metastatic disease. There were 34 patients under age 5 with a greater proportion having M+ disease: 42% vs. 30% for those older. First line therapy was chemotherapy only in 9.6% of patients, radiotherapy only in 11.4%, with a decrease from 16.4% in the first group (20012005) to 6.8% in the second group (20062010), and combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy in 60.8% of patients. In the 20012005 period, high dose chemotherapy was used alone in 8.7% and with radiotherapy in 23.1%. Survival at 5 years was 80% for patients receiving radiotherapy and 40% for those not receiving radiotherapy (p= 0.0001). Stage M0 vs. M+, and age under 5 years were also significantly related to survival (both p=0.038) in the COX Hazard model. There was no difference in survival by gender or 5year periods. Conclusions: There was no improvement in survival over the study time period, and the use of radiotherapy as first line was the most important prognostic factor. Younger children, under 5 years, presented with a worse stage. There was an independent effect of young age and stage on prognosis, but to a much lower extent than the use of radiotherapy as first line therapy. P-314 Clinical Management of Pediatric Ependymoma in Iran: A Retrospective Single CenterBased Study Faranoush1 1MAHAK Cancer Treatment and Center, Oncology, Tehran, Iran; 2Cancer Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Sciences, Tehran, Iran; 3St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Oncology, Memphis, USA Background/Objectives: The literature on treating pediatric ependymoma in Iran is scarce. Thus, we designed this study to review the clinical care, treatment regimens, and followup of Iranian pediatric patients with ependymoma. Design/Methods: Data were gathered from medical records retrospectively based on definitive inclusion and exclusion criteria. All of the patients were younger than 15 years and had an approved histopathology report confirming the diagnosis of ependymoma. Patients were divided into two subgroups based on their age at diagnosis (i.e., 3 years vs >3 years) and type of initial surgical procedure (i.e., surgery vs. biopsy). Finally, parametric and nonparametric statistical analyses were done SPSS software (ver 22). Results: In total, 73 eligible patients were enrolled in the study; 20 patients were categorized into the younger group and 53 into the older group. The majority (91.8%, n=67) of patients underwent initial grosstotal or partial surgical resection, and six (8.2%) had a biopsy. Thirty patients delayed diagnosis more than 1 month after the onset of clinical signs or symptoms, and 21 patients experienced ependymoma recurrence. The median duration of followup was 49 months. The 3year overall survival and progressionfree survival rate were 61% and 48.5%, respectively. At the time of this review, 27 patients had died of various causes. Conclusions: We conclude that accurate disease staging and histopathology reporting and standardized radiotherapy and chemotherapy regimens need to be implemented in Iran to improve the clinical care and followup of pediatric patients with ependymoma.

P-315 Early Diagnosis of Optic Glioma in Children with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) M. Moschovi M. Nikolaou1, A. Athanasiadou1, I. Nikas2, G. Chrousos3 1University of Athens Medical School, Pediatric Dept Hematology/Oncology Unit, Athens, Greece; 2\"Aghia Sofia\" Children's Hospital, Department of Imaging, Athens, Greece; 3University of Athens Medical School, 1st Pediatric Department, Athens, Greece Background/Objectives: Children with neurofibromatosis type1 (NF1) develop optic pathway gliomas, which result from impaired NF1 protein regulation of Ras activity. The importance of early diagnosis of optic pathway gliomas in children with Nf1, in order to eliminate the impairment of visual activity. Design/Methods: Twenty one children with optic pathway gliomas who were diagnosed and treated in our unit were enrolled in this study. Patients were divided in three groups. Group 1: seven patients without caf\u00e9aulait spots who were diagnosed because of symptoms caused by the tumor. Group II: seven patients with caf\u00e9aulait spots who had a routine followup with brainMRI, from early age. Group III: seven patients with caf\u00e9aulait spots without routine followup who were diagnosed due to visual loss or heavy decrease of visual activity. All patients received chemotherapy according to the NF1 gene status. All patients remain in followup except one, who died from other cause. Results: The age at diagnosis of optic pathway gliomas ranged from 3 months10 years. (Medium: 3 years). Group I: The age ranged from 3 months6 years (Median: 4 years). Total visual loss after biopsy was noted in two cases. Group II: The patients' age ranged from 8 months3 years (median: 2 years). They had progressively decrease visual activity at diagnosis. They received chemotherapy. Significant improvement of the visual activity was noted. Group III: The patients' age ranged from 3 years10 years (Median: 3 years). They received chemotherapy, but there was no improvement of the visual activity. Conclusions: 1) Children with Caf\u00e9 au lait spots need a careful monitoring of the visual activity and imaging for optic glioma. 2) Early diagnosis of tumor and detection of visual impairment may help to improve the visual activity with chemotherapy. 4) Chemotherapy is not effective in delay diagnosis of the optic pathway gliomas. P-316 Oxytocin in ChildhoodOnset Craniopharygioma First Experiences with Oxytocin Administration H.L. M\u00fcller 1, A. Daubenb\u00fcchel1, WarmuthMetz2, J. \u00d6zyurt3 1Klinikum Oldenburg A\u00f6R Medical Campus University Oldenburg, Department of Pediatrics and Pediatric Hematology / Oncology, Oldenburg, 3Carl Ossietzky University Oldenburg, Department of Psychology, Oldenburg, Germany Background/Objectives: Quality of survival after childhood craniopharyngioma (CP) is frequently impaired by hypothalamic involvement (HI) and sequelae such as obesity and neuropsychological deficits. Oxytocin (OXY) is produced in the hypothalamus, secreted by posterior pituitary gland, and plays a major role in regulation of behavior and body composition. Design/Methods: In a crosssectional study, OXY saliva concentrations were analyzed in 34 CP and in 73 healthy controls. OXY was measured in saliva before and after standardized breakfast and associations with gender, body mass index (BMI), HI, diabetes insipidus, and irradiation were analyzed. Furthermore, emotion recognition abilities were analyzed with regard to OXY concentrations in saliva and urine before and after nasal administration of 24 IU OXY in 10 CP with hypothalamic lesions (4 grade I: limited to anterior hypothalamus; 6 grade II: involving mammillary bodies and posterior hypothalamus). Perception and identification of emotional expressions were tested using the Geneva Multimodal Emotion Portrayals (GEMEP) corpus. Mental state was assessed by Multidimensional Mood Questionnaire. Results: CP with preoperative HI showed similar OXY levels compared to CP without HI and controls. However, CP with grade I hypothalamic lesions presented with lower OXY levels (p=0.017) under fasting condition compared to CP with grade II lesions and CP without hypothalamic lesions. CP patients' changes in OXY levels before and after breakfast correlated (p=0.02) with BMI. In a pilot trial, nasal administration of OXY was well tolerated and resulted in increased OXY concentrations in saliva and urine. After OXY administration, CP with grade I hypothalamic lesions showed improvements in emotional identifications compared to CP with grade 2 lesions. Conclusions: CP patients continue to secrete OXY, especially when anterior hypothalamic areas are not involved, but OXY shows less variation due to nutrition. OXY might have positive effects on emotion perception in CP with specific lesions of anterior hypothalamic areas. P-317 The Oncogenic Role of a Novel KLC1ROS1 Fusion Gene Identified in a Pediatric LowGrade Glioma Y. Nakano 1, A. Tomiyama1, H. Sakamoto5, K. Ichimura1 1National Cancer Center Research Institute, Division of Brain Tumor Translational Research, Tokyo, Japan; 2Osaka City General Hospital, Department of Pathology, Osaka, Japan; 3National Cancer Center Research Institute, Division of Genome Biology, Tokyo, Japan; 4National Cancer Center Hospital, Department of Pathology and Clinical Laboratories, Tokyo, Japan; 5Osaka City General Hospital, Department of Pediatric Neurosurgery, Osaka, Japan; 6Osaka City General Hospital, Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Osaka, Japan Background/Objectives: We investigated novel oncogenic fusion genes identified in pediatric gliomas for their potential as novel therapeutic targets. Design/Methods: RNA sequencing was performed on three pediatric low grade gliomas which did not harbor any of the oncogenic driver mutations known in gliomas (BRAF, FGFR1, H3F3A) to discover novel oncogenic gene fusions. The presence of candidate fusion genes in clinical samples was verified by fluorescence insitu hybridization and their expression by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical staining. Several oncogenic signal transduction pathways and oncogenic phenotypes mediated by these candidates were also analyzed by immunoblotting, focus forming assay, and invasion assay using glioma cell lines overexpressing these candidates. Results: We identified a novel KLC1ROS1 fusion gene in a lowgrade glioma from a threeyearsold female patient. Expression of this fusion RNA and protein in the clinical sample was confirmed. An immunoblot analysis of cell lysates of glioma cell lines expressing the KLC1ROS1 fusion gene demonstrated an elevated activation of growth factorrelated signaling such as ERK1/2, Akt, or mTOR. Furthermore, the glioma cell lines transfected with this fusion gene demonstrated enhanced formation of foci by focus forming assay and elevated invasiveness by transwell invasion assay, all of which were blocked by treatment with ROS1 inhibitor, Crizotinib. Conclusions: The novel KLC1ROS1 fusion gene which we identified from a pediatric low grade glioma has an oncogenic activity via ROS1 signaling and could potentially serve as a novel therapeutic target against gliomas which possess this fusion gene. P-318 Molecular Characterization of NF1 Gene in a Small Turkish Population with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 and a Novel Mutation F.G. Pinarli1, F. Pinarli2, Oncology, Ankara, Turkey; 2Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Research Hospital, Medical Genetics, Turkey Background/Objectives: Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by heterozygous mutations in the neurofibromin gene (NF1; 613113) on chromosome 17q11. Here we describe the results of next generation sequencing (NGS) of 18 patients who presented with the clinical features of NF1 at Gazi University Department of Pediatric Oncology. Design/Methods: DNA was isolated from peripheral blood using MagNA Pure LC DNA Isolation Kit. Ion Ampliseq Custom NF Panel has been designed and used for massively parallel sequencing for target regions (all Exons, UTRs, Splicing sites) of NF1 gene with IonS5. Mutation surveying has been done by using Ion Reporter and Alamut Visual software and different mutation databases and tools according to the 2016 ACMG Variant Classification and Interpretation Guideline. Detected mutations which have been linked with Clinical data have been confirmed with DNA Sequencing by Capillary electrophoresis by using 3130 (Applied Biosystems). Results: The study included 10 male and 8 female patients with a median age of 10.5 years. Sixteen patients were diagnosed as NF1 according to clinical criteria. Two patients had only multiple caf\u00e9aulait spots. The family history was present in 7 patients (38.9%). Three patients had optic gliomas (16.7%) and one patient was diagnosed as atypical meningioma after surgical excision. We detected a genetic variant in 12 patients (66.6%) via NGS. The types of these mutations were as follows: likely benign (n=1), variants of uncertain significance (VUS, n=2), likely pathogenic (n=3), VUS + pathogenic (n=1), and pathogenic (n=5). One of pathogenic variants is c.7023delC (p.Leu2342Cysfs*4) heterozygote at 47th exon, which previously described in the NF1 database, ithus ndicating a novel mutation. Conclusions: We describe a novel NF1 gene mutation in a Turkish patient. The lack of mutation detection in 33,3% of our patients indicate that other methods than NGS must be used in NF1 mutation screening. P-319 Pediatric Medulloblastoma Experience in Mexico V. Salcedarivera 1, F. Arreguin2, R. Gonzalez3, R. Bellido4, Oncology, Mexico Background/Objectives: Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor in children. Data from developing countries is limited. We describe our multiinstitutional experience in pediatric medulloblastoma in Mexico. Objectives: To describe the clinical features of Mexican children with medulloblastoma. Draw comparisons of the different chemotherapy regimens used, determine patient overall (OS) and eventfree survival (EFS). Determine clinical risk factors for death or relapse. Design/Methods: We conducted a retrospective multivariate analysis of patients with medulloblastoma from 20 hospitals around Mexico, between 19972017. Statistical methods used were the KaplanMeier curve, the survival logrank test, and Coxregression model. Patients were divided into two groups: 1)children >35 years of age with nonmetastatic tumor <1.5cm2, compromised the standardrisk group; 2)patients without the previously mentioned characteristics were classified as highrisk. Results: A total of 255 patients were included with an average age at diagnosis of 6.8 years (0.117yo), 17.6% <3yo, to ICE (5yEFS 71.1% vs. 64.1%; p=0.002). The average and 52.5Gy (2456Gy) to the posterior ratios calculated at p<0.05 were as follows: highrisk 3.55, residual tumor >1.5cm2 3.53, anaplastic 2.5, presence metastasis 1.76, ICE 5yOS was 61.1% and the 5yEFS 54.2%. Conclusions: The most commonly used chemotherapy regimen was ICE and was related to a significantly lower OS. Patients with residual tumor, anaplastic histology or metastasis were also associated with a lower OS. We need multiinstitutional prospective clinical trials to better define survival, risk factors and outcome in Mexico.

To evaluate treatment results of 48 patients under 5 years (1357m, median 42.5m) with primarily diagnosed medulloblastoma (MB) depending on the current risk factors. Design/Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 48 patients, who are observed in Rogachev's Center from September 2002 till February 2017. Molecular genetic testing was perfomed in all cases (DKFZ, Germany): Gr3 was diagnosed were in 3/2/17/11/1 cases. HIT PD; with/without RT 0.8/0.75 (p=0.84). Conclusions: The worst prognosis in Group 3 patients under 3 years, with R+, M+. For further strategy treatment verification additional studies are needed. P-321 The Changing Paradigm of Pediatric Medulloblastoma in Kerala; Improved Outcomes with New Challenges S. Kotne1, A. Philip1, R. Pillai1, W. Jose1, D. Menon2, K. Pavithran1, H. Sankaran 1 1Amrita Institute Medical Sciences, Department of Medical Oncology, Ernakulam, India; 2Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences, Department of Radiation Oncology, Ernakulam, India Background/Objectives: Treatment outcomes for medulloblastoma with optimal therapy (surgery, radiation and chemotherapy) have led to 5year overall survival (OS) rates in developed countries of 80% and 60% for standard and high risk disease, respectively. In resource limited settings, similar outcomes are possible and new challenges include followup of treatment related side effects. This study assessed the outcomes of medulloblastoma in a tertiary care setting and followup of these patients. Design/Methods: A total of 36 cases of medulloblastoma below 18 years were treated on POG9031 or CCG9921 between January 2005 and January 2015. Patients were classified as standard risk or high risk disease based on modified Chang criteria. The prognostic value of age, sex, risk category, histopathological variants was assessed by univariate analysis using the logrank test. Nonparametric OS curves were computed using the KaplanMeier estimates, and the logrank test was used to compare survival according to histologic subtype. Results: A total of 27 cases were eligible for analysis. The median age of diagnosis was 8 years and median followup was 24 months. The 5year OS and 95% highrisk disease, respectively. 17 (63%) cases had regular followup with a medical provider post completion of therapy, 8 (33%) cases were documented to have mild cognitive decline, though no formal testing had been done.10 cases (40%) were regularly followed for endocrine sequelae, of which 2 cases (7%) had a diagnosed growth hormone deficiency. Conclusions: Based on our institutional data, we found that our medulloblastoma outcomes were similar to what has been reported in developed countries. However new challenges exist in the followup and management of treatment related side effects in these patients. This underlies the current need for multidisciplinary followup and care of this evergrowing population of cancer survivors. P-322 Evaluation of Gaze Stability by Eye Tracking Method in Patients with Medulloblastoma M. Shurupova1, V. Anisimov1, A. Drenyova 1, A. Latanov2, V. Kasatkin1 1Dmitry Rogachev National Research Center, Clinical Rehabilitation Research Center for patients in remission \"Russkoye pole\", Moscow, Russia; 2Lomonosov State University, Faculcity of Biology, Moscow, Russia Background/Objectives: Cerebellum plays a crucial role in motor control and planning. The lesions of the cerebellum lead to oculomotor impairments. Medulloblastoma is a severe disease and is localized mostly in the area of vermis and hemispheres of cerebellum. Presence of a malignant growth and therapy's toxicity lead to stable invalidism. Design/Methods: We assessed the feasibility of a test of gaze stabilization on a target in patients with medulloblastoma. Patients underwent a standard course of rehabilitation in Rehab Centre \"Russian Field\" (Chekhov, Russian Federation). Five patients (three girls and two boys, aged 13.417.9 years) and eight normal subjects (three girls and five boys, aged 10.615.2 years) participated in the study. Eye movements were recorded by Arrington Research 60 Hz eye tracker. In experiments the participants performed the gaze stabilization test (GST) involved the focusing on the four targets (left and right, up and down at \u00b119\u00b0 and \u00b111\u00b0 of eccentricities, respectively). Two GST sessions were carried out during first and second rehabilitation courses separated by 3.29.2 months interval. Results: The gaze dispersion in patients were higher compared with that in normal subjects (p<0.0001). Such instability relates foremost to oculomotor control disorders in patients which manifest in macrosaccadic oscillations, nystagmus, intrusive saccades, and square wave jerks. A decrease of gaze dispersion in four patients (p<0.0001 for each) occurred in the second GST session, presumably caused by reduction of intrusive saccades frequency and context inappropriate saccades both representing higher efficacy of voluntary attention control. Conclusions: Patients with medulloblastoma demonstrated poor gaze stability compared to normal subjects. The positive dynamics of gaze stability in patients has been achieved by rehabilitation courses. Eye movement patterns could be considered as objective indicators of specific oculomotor disorders. Eye tracking method represents additional diagnostic tool in rehabilitation practice. P-323 Focal Radiotherapy and Temozolomide Following Complete Resection are Superior to Intensive Chemotherapy in Children with Embryonal Tumors with Multilayered Rosettes (ETMR) I. 1Medical University of Vienna, Pediatrics, Austria; 2Medical University of Vienna, Neurosurgery, Vienna, Austria; 3Medical University of Vienna, Radiotherapy, Vienna, Austria; 4Medical University of Vienna, Institute of Neurology, Vienna, Austria Background/Objectives: Embryonal tumor with multilayered rosettes (ETMR) is a rare new entity characterized by LIN28A expression and alterations in the C19MC locus at 19q13.42. ETMR occurs in young children and has a dismal prognosis. We report on our single institution experience in seven consecutive patients. Design/Methods: Between 2006 and 2016, seven patients were diagnosed with an ETMR. Diagnosis was established prospectively by characteristic histopathologic features, LIN28 immunostaining and amplification of the locus 19q13.42 in five patients and retrospectively confirmed in 2 additional patients originally diagnosed as CNS PNET (central nervous system primitive neuroectodermal tumor).Tumor location was supratentorial in all patients. Median age at diagnosis was 25 months (range 638). Male to female ratio was 1:6. Results: All patients had a GTR or near total resection and the first five patients were treated according to high risk PNET or ATRT (atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor) protocols including highdose chemotherapy in three patients. All five patients recurred after a median of 6 months (range 211) and all except one patient who died after high dose chemotherapy succumbed to their disease after a median of 13 months (range 728). Following a case report by Mozes et. al., (1) the last two patients were treated with primary focal radiotherapy, intrathecal therapy and concomitant temozolomide followed by 12 courses of temozolomide 150200mg/m2. Both patients are in CR 18 and 12 months after diagnosis. Conclusions: Complete surgical removal followed by early focal radiotherapy and temozolomide seems to be superior to intensive conventional therapy including highdose chemotherapy.

J Neurooncol (2016) 126:99105 P-324 of in the Treatment of Anaplastic Ependymoma E. Slobina 1, F. Antonenko1, 1Russian Scientific Center of RoentgenoRadiology, Radiotherapy of Children Diseases, Moscow, Russia Background/Objectives: Demonstrate the possibility of clinical application of modern methods of radiation therapy of anaplastic ependymoma. Design/Methods: From January 2016 to February 2017, five patients (median age 3 years) for anaplastic ependymoma received complex treatment according to the protocol HIT2014, consisting of courses of weekly vincristinecontaining chemotherapy and external beam irradiation in the volume of craniospinal irradiation (CSR) (dose per fraction 1,6Gr, total dose 24Gr (35.2 Gy), followed by local irradiation of the postoperative bed of the removed tumor, dose per fraction 1.8Gr up to total dose 55Gr was carried out. Preliminary radiotherapy planning was performed using the 3D conformal radiotherapy with optimization (IMRT) for all patients. After analyzing the received dosevolume histograms (DVH), VMAT was used in the CSR in 2 patients, and in 3 patients in the local irradiation. In 4 patients, treatment was performed using 12 coplanar treatment arches, in 1 patient using 2 nonplanar therapeutic arches. Radiotherapy using VMAT technology was performed using the Eclipse planning system on the Truebeam linear accelerator. Results: When comparing the results of the preliminary planning of IMRT and VMAT, the total treatment time was reduced from 1015 minutes with IMRT up to 24 minutes at VMAT. The number of monitoring units (MU) decreased 2.3 times on average with VMAT, while the coverage of the planned treatment volume with 95% treatment isodose did not significantly differ: 97.6% (IMRT) and 94.8% (VMAT) with a significant reduction in the radiation load on the doselimiting organs. The early and late side effects of radiation therapy (RTOG scale) were minimal. Conclusions: The use of VMAT opens new possibilities in the treatment of oncological diseases in children, because due to the above described properties, the risk of developing induced secondary tumors will decrease, and the time of finding the child on the treatment unit will be significantly reduced. P-325 Targeted Therapy in Patients with Progressive Low Grade Gliomas D. Sumerauer 1, S. Cyprova1, M. Motol, Oncology, Prague 5, Czech Republic; 2Faculty Hospital Motol, Department of Imaging Methods, Prague 5, Czech Republic; 3Charles University, Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine, Prague 5, Czech Republic Background/Objectives: Pediatric lowgrade gliomas are the most common brain tumors in children. They are characterized by alterations of the Ras/MAPK pathway. Although frequently cured with complete resection, patients with unresectable lesions experience multiple progressions and are at increased risk for longterm neurological sequelae. Design/Methods: We present our experience with targeted therapy in 4 patients with recurrent low grade glioma, treated at the time of progression with either BRAF inhibitor (dabrafenib) or MEKinhibitor (trametinib) according to the molecular alteration detected in the tumor tissue. Results: Two patients, 8.5 year old boy with recurrent thalamic PXA and 6month old boy with rapidly progressing optic pathway glioma started dabrafenib treatment at a dose 5.25 mg/kg/day upon BRAF V600E activating mutation was detected in the recurrent tumor. Both boys experienced profound radiological response and rapid clinical improvement. No toxicities were seen except selflimiting itchy macular rash in older boy lasting for two weeks only, immediately at the beginning of the treatment. Two other patients (4.5 year old boy with OPG, 17 year old girl with NF1 and posterior fossa/brainstem glioma) with BRAF fusion, were treated with trametinib at a dose 0.025 mg/kg/day. Both patient obtained disease stabilization while on treatment, but the girl repeatedly experienced grade 2 papulopustular rash. Conclusions: Dabrafenib is active and well tolerated among with BRAF V600 mutationpositive pediatric recurrent lowgrade glioma, trametinib at least stabilizes tumors with BRAF fusion, again with minimal toxicity P-326 Clinicopathological Review of Paediatric Meningioma from A Single Centre E.

Current management recommendations include complete resection, careful pathological review and multidisciplinary discussions regarding postoperative treatment. Design/Methods: Retrospective analysis of 37 children with meningioma diagnosed between 1990 to 2016 was conducted. Data on patient demographics, tumour characteristics, treatment and outcomes was obtained from hospital records. Histopathological specimens were reviewed to align the subtype and grade with the WHO 2016 classification. Results: Median age of diagnosis was 10.01 years (range: 1.03 - 16.03). Male: female ratio was 1.4:1. (24.3%), cranial radiotherapy. Histopathology review confirmed the majority of meningiomas to be low grade (WHO Grade I or II). Two had rhabdoid meningioma (WHO Grade III) - one died within 5 months despite complete resection (CR) and radiotherapy, whereas the other patient is still alive 6 years after CR. Three had multiple meningiomas in both intracranial and spinal compartments. About one third of patients had meningiomas at skull base (n=12). Other tumour locations were intraventricular (n=6), convexity (n=6), spinal (n=5), extracranial (two involving optic nerve sheath, one occurring in maxillary sinus antrum) and sylvian fissure (n=2).2 patients had biopsies, 13 had incomplete resection and 22 achieved complete resection (5 achieved with more than 1 operative procedures). 7 patients had adjuvant radiotherapy as part of primary treatment.Median followup was 5.18 0.15 resection and (60%) with incomplete resection and no adjuvant radiotherapy. Conclusions: The strong association with NF2 reinforces recommendations for genetics referral to look for associated syndromes. Age, extent of resection and histological grade are factors for consideration in postoperative treatment. Relapse was higher without complete resection. P-327 Investigation of RBM24 as a Potential Regulator of Cellular Proliferation, Apoptosis and Chemoresistance in Tone 2 1Ribeirao Preto (MB) is the most common malignant brain tumor in children and is classified in subgroup Wnt, Shh, Group 3 and Group 4. Despite the current therapy displayed good outcomes, patients with MB SHH TP53 mutant have poor prognosis due to primary resistance to chemotherapy and progressive metastasis. Our study identified a RNA Binding protein named RBM24 overexpressed in MB SHH TP53 mutant cell lines and in TP53 allele Loss in patients. We performed Knockout in RBM24 gene on mutant TP53 cell lines in prior to investigate its roles in Apoptosis and proliferation. Design/Methods: To assess mRNA levels of RBM24 in MB cell lines and patients with MB. It was performed Real Time PCR using TaqMan probes for RBM24 (Hs00290607_m). The platform Methylation array Illumina 450k was used to asses copy number profile of TP53 in patients with MB. Trough lentiviral transduction and flow sorting of GFPexpressing cells, it was generated UW473 CRISPR RBM24KO (KO) Mutant TP53 MB cell line. It was performed in vitro Proliferation assay using CKK8 cell counting and AnnexinV (FITC) kit assay. All experiments were performed thrice. Oneway ANOVA was performed for Statistical analysis. Results: Our study identified reduction of cellular proliferation and increase of apoptosis levels in KO cell lines. Moreover, when treated with Doxorubicin for 48h, we identified a decrease in proliferation of 95% when compared to untreated control and 45% compared to treated control. For apoptosis, 80% of KO cells went for early apoptosis and 20% for late apoptosis. We also detected an increase in protein levels of P53 phosphorylation, P63alpha, P73 and P21 in KO cell lines. Conclusions: This data suggests a new role of RBM24 as a negative regulator of P53 family members and a potential oncogene suppressor of apoptosis, driver of proliferation and promoter of chemoresistance. Finantial Support by FAPESP Process Num.2013/120063 P-328 Differential Expression of MST2 and MST4 Among the Brazil Background/Objectives: Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common tumor of central nervous system in childhood. The MB molecular classification was based on several studies dividing in four molecular subgroups: WNT, SHH, Group 3 and Group 4, facilitating diagnosis and treatment. In the search for potential targets, we found MST2 and MST4, members of MST kinases family (Mammalian Sterile Twenty Like). Several studies have shown the involvement of MSTs in carcinogenesis of different tumor types, and some studies show the relationship with developmental pathways associated with MB. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the expression of MST kinases in MB samples, and investigated the difference of MST expression among molecular subgroups. Design/Methods: We analyzed the expression of MST2 and MST4 in 48 samples of MB, 4 cell lines of MB and 5 nonneoplastic human cerebellum controls by qRTPCR. For this analysis, it was used Taqman gene probes and the endogenous controls were GUS and HPRT. Comparisons of MST expression in tumor samples versus cerebellum nonneoplastic and molecular subgroups was performed using MannWhitney test. Results: MST2 is upregulated in tumors (p=0,015) and cell lines (p=0,032) when compared to nonneoplastic cerebellum, and the expression of MST4 have no difference comparing tumor and cell lines with controls. Analysis of gene expression among molecular subgroups showed difference of MST2 expression comparing Group Shh/Wnt and Group 3/4, MST2 is upregulated in the Group Shh/Wnt (p=0,033).MST4 expression is also different between the molecular subgroups. Group Wnt has MST4 downregulated compared with others 4 (p=0,006). Conclusions: The MST2 andMST4 expression shows relationship to molecular subgroups of MB and may be related with molecular pathways like Wnt and Shh. Studies and novel assays are being conducted to understand better these findings. P-329 The Germline Variants in DNA Repair Genes and LifeThreatening Toxicity During Chemotherapy in Children with Medulloblastoma J. Trubicka 1, T. emojtel2, J. Institute, Pathology, Warsaw, Poland; 2Charit\u00e9 Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, Institute for Medical Genetics and Human Genetics, Berlin, Germany; 3Charit\u00e9 Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, BerlinBrandenburg Center for Regenerative Therapies, Berlin, Germany; 4Warsaw Medical University, Department of Medical Genetics, Warsaw, Poland; 5The Children's Memorial Health Institute, Department of Medical Genetics, Warsaw, Poland; 6The Children's Memorial Health Institute, Department of Oncology, Warsaw, Poland Background/Objectives: Agents which interfere with DNA repair mechanisms are employed as therapeutic compounds in pediatric oncology. Furthermore, alterations in DNA repair genes in patients may affect repair efficiency and response to therapy. The purpose of this study was to establish relationship between presence of abnormalities in selected DNA repair genes and lifethreatening toxicity during chemotherapy in children with medulloblastoma. Design/Methods: The coding sequences of MSH2 and RAD50 genes were investigated using targeted gene sequencing, and NBN pathogenic variants (p.I171V and p.K219fs*19) by Sanger sequencing in altogether >100 patients. In three patients with presence of rare lifethreatening adverse events (AE) and no detected variants in the analyzed genes, whole exome sequencing was performed. Presence of identified variants was correlated with the occurrence of rare lifethreatening AE, other clinical features and molecular group of tumour. Results: Potentially pathogenic variants in DNA repair genes were identified in eight out of fifteen patients who suffered from lifethreatening toxicity during chemotherapy. The altered genes in addition to two known NBN gene variants. Patients with defects in either of MSH2, RAD50 or NBN genes suffered from rare lifethreatening AE more frequently than in control group (p=0.0005). Conclusions: Our results, based on the largest systematic study of medulloblastoma, provide preliminary evidence for a link between defects in DNA repair genes and treatment related toxicity. We suggest, that for patients with presence of DNA repair genes variants, the special vigilance during and after currently applied therapeutic regiments is required. Also, the potential revision of the mode of treatment should be considered for those patients in the future.

P-330 Primary Intracranial Tumors Diagnosed in the First Year of Life: A Retrospective Study of Belgian Cases Between 2001 and 2014 J. Der\u00eame1, S. Jacobs2, E. Sariban3, S. Schifflers4, Background/Objectives: Brain tumours represent 15% of cancers in children younger than one year. Studies describing brain tumours in this age group are limited and some revealed differences compared to the older paediatric population. We aimed to describe brain tumours in children under one year of age in Belgium and to define how they differ from older children. Design/Methods: Retrospective analysis of records of patients diagnosed with primary intracranial neoplasms in the first year of life in Belgium between 2001 and 2014. Eligible patients were retrieved from hospital databases of Belgian Paediatric Oncology Departments and the Belgian Cancer Registry. Brain metastases, vascular malformations, spinal tumours and hamartomas were excluded. such as clinical presentation, intracranial localisation, histologic subtype, late morbidity and outcome, were recorded. Results: Sixty patients met the inclusion criteria. Median age at diagnosis was 7 months. Fifteen percent of tumors were metastatic at diagnosis. The median followup time was 86.19 months. The median prediagnosis interval was 28 days. The most frequent hypertension were present in 64.3% of cases. The most common signs were vomiting (43.3%) and bulging fontanelles (26.7%). Hydrocephalus was present in 41.7%. Clinical presentation correlated with anatomical localisation. Fiveyear overall survival was 66.6%. Survival varied significantly with histologic type, grade and completeness of surgical resection. However, age, localisation, age at diagnosis, prediagnosis symptom interval and primary dissemination did not correlate with overall survival. Conclusions: Most infants with brain tumours present with signs of intracranial hypertension. Outcome is determined by histology and completeness of resection. Outcomes compare favourably with series from the literature, possibly due to a higher proportion of low grade lesions. This series describes clinical characteristics, treatment and outcome of infant brain tumours in infants before the era of molecular diagnostics and therapeutics. P-331 The Link Between Neurocognitive Functioning and HealthRelated Quality of Life in Pediatric Brain Tumors L. Van den Wyngaert 1, G. Vercruysse1, K. Vandenabeele1, M. HematologyOncology, Leuven, Belgium Background/Objectives: Thanks to medical advances during the last decades, children with a brain tumor reach adulthood more often. Measurements of healthrelated quality of life (HRQOL) and neuropsychological functioning have therefore become increasingly important. Our study aimed to examine the impact of neurocognitive functioning on HRQOL in patients, both immediately after diagnosis and in followup. Design/Methods: Children diagnosed with a brain tumor at the University Hospitals Leuven, were followed with neuropsychological assessments. In total, 49 patients (mean age at diagnosis 8.91 \u00b1 4.18 years) Neuropsychological assessments were acquired within maximum six months after diagnosis, as well as after two years. Assessments included objective measurements of cognition (intelligence, memory, visualmotor functioning, attention and executive functioning) and subjective measurements of HRQOL (PedsQLTM Brain Tumor Module). Paired Ttests and pearson correlations were used to assess relationships between the neurocognitive variables and HRQOL in this population. Results: Based on paired Ttests, attention (t(48)=3.39, p=0.001) and executive functioning (t(48)=2.27, p=0.03) declined over time. Consistent with literature, we found few significant correlations between the neurocognitive variables and the general measure of HRQOL. At diagnosis, a significant association between memory and patientreported HRQOL was found (r=0.453, p<0.05). Interestingly, the followup different correlations. More specifically, parentreported HRQOL was correlated with both p<0.01;r =0.323, p<0.05). Correlations between subscales of HRQOL showed association between verbal intelligence and parentreported cognition (r=0.427, p<0.05) p<0.05). Conclusions: Newly arising correlations after two years suggest a stronger link between attention and executive functioning, most strongly declining neurocognitive functions in our population, and subjective measurements of HRQOL. Possibly, parents' expectations of daily life functioning also change throughout time. P-332 Central Nervous System Tumors B. Yilmaz 1, N. Eker1, G. Tokuc1, O. Dogru1, E. Senay1, B. Berk1 1Marmara Pendik Training and Research Hospital, Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Istanbul, Turkey Background/Objectives: Central nervous system (CNS) tumors are the most common solid tumors in childhood. Our instution is the one of the major referral center for pediatric brain tumors in Turkey. We aimed to analyzed children with brain tumors who were diagnosed and treated at our center in this study. Design/Methods: This is a retrospective study of 96 pediatric patients with brain tumors treated in between 2009 to 2017. Sixteen patients were lost to followup and 80 patients were included in the analysis. Demographic informations, histologic subtypes, stage at diagnosis, treatment modalities and outcomes were evaluated, retrospectively. Results: Of the 80 patients, 42 (52.5%) were males, 38.5 (47.5%) were females. The mean age was 6.8 \u00b1 4.6 years (ranging from 0.17 years to 15.5 years). The mean duration of follow up was 30 months. Mean survival time was 71.4 months (95% CI: 61.8 80.9). The most common localization was the infratentorial area (38.8%). Among all of the patients, gliomas are the most common histologic form (54 %) and 51,3% had grade IV stage for WHO. Fiveyear overall survival (OS) is 68 %. The most important factor for OS was tumor total resectabity. Total resectable patients OS was 81% vs gross total resection (GTR) was 49.5% vs partial resection was only 28% within 5 years. The children with infiltrative pontine glioma (DIPG) and atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT) had the worst prognosis and these patients died in the first year of their treatment. Conclusions: In developing countries, as the use of molecular studies could not be routinely performed in clinical practice. Brain tumors are relatively common cancers among children.usually the first and the most important step in therapy. Patients with the most complete resection have significantly longer survival despite all of the technological advances. P-333 Comparative Analysis of miRNA Expression in Pediatric Neuronal and Mixed NeuronalGlial Tumors M. Zakrzewska 1, K. Zakrzewski3, P.P. Liberski1 1Medical University of Department of Molecular Pathology and Neuropathology, Lodz, Poland; 2Medical University of Lodz, Department of Biostatistics and Translational Medicine, Lodz, Poland; 3Polish Mother Memorial Hospital Research Institute, Department of Neurosurgery, Lodz, Poland Background/Objectives: The current knowledge concerning the molecular biology of pediatric lowgrade brain tumors is still unsatisfactory. Moreover the data concerning the biology of CNS neuronal and mixed neuronalglial tumors continue to be enigmatic due to their rare occurrence.Those tumors show considerable genomic heterogeneity even in case of the same histological features. The aim of the study was to evaluate the microRNA profiles of pilocytic astrocytoma (PA), ganglioglioma (GG) and dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNT). Design/Methods: A total group of 60 cases in equal proportion of histological types was incorporated into this study. The material for molecular analyses was obtained during standard neurosurgical procedures. Total RNA was extracted according to the standard procedures. Microarray testing was performed with the using of the miRCURY LNA microRNA Array technology. After filtration 782 miRNAs were eligible for analysis. Obtained data was compared using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the BenjaminiHochberg procedure used to estimate false discovery rates (FDR). MicroRNAs that were significant in ANOVA were considered eligible for further posthoc pairwise comparisons using the ttest. Results: The pattern of expression changes differed considerably among the miRNAs between analysed subgroups of tumors with: miR4754, miR4350, miR628 having the highest expression in DNTs, miR155 being elevated in GGs and miR3660 showing elevated expression levels in the PAs. Conversely, miRPlusA1086, let7b, miR891a and miR4758 were downregulated in DNTs tumors in comparison to the other groups. Conclusions: Current study provides information regarding the miRNA alterations related to the pediatric low grade brain tumors especially to the relatively rare neuronal and mixed neuronalglial tumors. Each tumor type showed characteristic miRNA expression profile. It could be interesting particularly in case of PA which could be the component of the most DNT as well as the main manifestation of its plausible recurrence. Work supported by the Polish NCN Grant No. 2014/15/B/NZ4/00744 P-334 Use of Bevacisumab as a Single or in Adjunct with Single Agent Carboplatin or Vinblastin or Vincristine/Carboplatin Regimens in Children Progressive N. 1, R. Rajagopal2, 2Department of Paediatric and Adolescent Clinical Haematology and Oncology, Princess Margaret Hospital for Children, Perth, WA; 3Department of Radiology, Princess Margaret Hospital for Children, Perth, WA; 4Department of Radiology, The royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, VIC Background/Objectives: Low grade gliomas (LGG) are difficult to treat due to variable degree of chemosensitivity and common proximity to vital brain structures which makes them not amenable to surgical resection, as a result many children experience multiple progressions of their disease and require several lines of therapy during their life. Historically being a mainstream therapy, radiation is now deferred as a last resort due to numerous significant side effects especially in young children and multiple chemotherapy regiments are employed with encouraging outcomes. Single agents Vinblastine and Carboplatin, Vincristine/Carboplatin combination have demonstrated progression free survival (PFS) of 3953% at 5 years with variable toxicity profile, which remains suboptimal to irradiated tumours with PFS of 6080%. Factor (VEGF) is increased in gliomas. Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to VEGF has shown antineoplastic effects in multiple malignancies in adult and paediatric population. Design/Methods: Addition of Bevacizumab to the treatment regimens of progressive LGG will result in durable stabilisation of disease, clinical and radiological improvement, and decrease tumourrelated morbidity. Bevacizumab was added to the 2nd to 4th line of therapy for progressive PLGG between 06/201402/2016. Combinations of single agent Carboplatin or Vinblastine and Vincristine/Carboplatin with Bevacizumab. Bevacizumab was administered as a single IV dose of 10mg/kg once biweekly or once monthly as per discretion of treating physician. Clinical and radiological responses were assessed. Results: We present the treatment outcomes of 15 patients with progressive PLGG with optic pathway/midline/thalamic/spinal location and disseminated disease treated with the above approach. Patients were given between 3 and 18 doses of Bevacizumab. Responses were variable with the majority of patients having a partial response. Toxicity was acceptable, the tumour related morbidity was prevented in all cases. Conclusions: Avastin can be used in treatment of PLGG. P-335 Quantitative Proteomic Profiling J. Sterba2, K. Zitterbart 2 1Masaryk Memorial Cancer Institute, Regional Centre for Applied Molecular Oncology, Brno, Czech Republic; 2University Hospital Brno and Faculty of University, Department of Pediatric Oncology, Brno, Czech Republic; 3Central European Institute of II, Brno, Czech Republic; 4University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine Masaryk University, Department of Pathology, Brno, Czech Republic Background/Objectives: Medulloblastoma, an embryonal neuroectodermal tumor of the cerebellum, is the most common malignant brain tumor in children. Molecular genetic studies led to the consensus defining four main subgroups of medulloblastoma (WNT, SHH, Group 3 and Group 4) based on transcriptional profiling. Recently, quantitative proteomics developed as a robust approach additional to genomics to identify prognostic markers and drugable targets in human cancer. Here, we employed a shotgun proteomic method to identify main prooncogenic signaling components in different molecular and clinical subgroups of medulloblastoma. Design/Methods: Briefly, medulloblastoma tissues (n=28) were lysed using urea buffer, stored at 80\u00b0C overnight and centrifuged for 30 minutes and the protein concentration was determined using BCA protein assay kit. One hundred micrograms of protein was digested using filter aided sample preparation. Peptides were labeled using 10plex isobaric mass tags and mixed together. Finally, the samples were analyzed using Orbitrap Elite coupled with UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano chromatograph and the acquired data processed with Proteome Discoverer 1.4. Results: A list of quantified proteins from tumor proteome was obtained and subjected to bioinformatical and statistical evaluation. The clustering revealed that proteomic analyses recapitulate transcriptionbased subgroup assignment in medulloblastoma and identified subgroupspecific proteins, which were further classified by geneannotation enrichment analysis and pathway mapping. Conclusions: To sum, we demonstrate that a mass spectrometrybased proteomic approach allows to distinguish molecular signatures linked to medulloblastoma subgroups. The study was supported by Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic grant AZV 1530657A and the project MEYSNPS I - LO1413. Treatment and Care Surgery (IPSO) P-336 Use of 3D Printing and Augmented Reality for Preoperative Planning of Complex Central Abdominal Tumors S. Abdessalam 1, L. Wong2, G. Linke1, T. vonAhlefeld1 1Children's Hospital and Medical Center, Pediatric Surgery, Omaha, USA; 2Children's Hospital and Medical Center, Pediatric Radiology, Omaha, USA Background/Objectives: Neuroblastoma is the most common solid extracranial tumor in the pediatric population. One of the most difficult locations to remove these tumors is within the central abdomen where encasement/abutment of major vascular structures makes removal very challenging and is accompanied by high morbidity and potential mortality. CT scans and MRI are used as the primary modalities in preoperative planning. At the forefront of technological growth in the world of medicine are 3D printing and Augmented Reality (AR). We are the first to use these technologies to help with the preoperative planning and intraoperative management of patients with central neuroblastomas. Design/Methods: CT scanning is done with 1 mm cuts of a prospective patient with a central neuroblastoma. The scans are reviewed between the surgeon and the radiologist to determine which structures are to be modeled. A 3D technologist works closely with the radiologist to accurately render a digital 3D model in medical segmentation software suite. The computer generated model is then reviewed with the surgeon for final approval using Augmented Reality glasses. Finally the model is printed in a piecemeal fashion for ease of manipulating the structures. Results: For our last three patients with a central neuroblastoma, we implemented the above technologies with excellent results. All three patients had successful removal of the entire tumor and associated lymphadenopathy with no major or minor intraoperative complications. Conclusions: 3D printing and Augmented Reality are very useful technological tools that go beyond the two dimensional world of CT. The ability to physically look at and touch the 3D print gives the surgeon insight into the precise anatomic detail of the complex vascular structures providing for safer operations. Also worth noting, patient/family satisfaction and understanding were heightened as a result of the physical model in comparison to showing images from the CT's. P-337 CTNNB1 GeneEncoding Catenin Deletions or Mutations in S. Agarwala 1, A. Varshney1, Iyer4, V. Bhatnagar1 1All Institute of Medical Sciences, Pediatric Surgery, Delhi, India; 2BRAIRCH All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Laboratory Oncology, Delhi, India; 3BRAIRCH All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Medical Oncology, Delhi, India; 4All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Pathology, Delhi, India Background/Objectives: The incidence of Hepatoblastoma(HB) is significantly elevated in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis who carry germline mutations in the APC tumor suppressor gene suggesting a role of over activation of the Wnt signaling pathway in tumor pathogenesis. Mutation or deletion of exon 3 in CTNNB1 geneencoding catenin has been frequently detected in hepatoblastoma cases worldwide. Mutation presence has been correlated with better response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and better overall survival. Design/Methods: Analyses of oncogenic mutations(missense mutations and interstitial deletions in exon 3) were performed by focusing on exon 3 of CTNNB1 in 26 HBL tumor samples, using standard PCR followed by subsequent DNA sequencing. Mutation identification was confirmed with at least 2 amplification reactions from the original DNA. Results: Samples from 23 patients in and age range 6132 months were included. There were 9 standard risk(SR) and 14 High risk(HR) patients. All patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (Cisplatin monotherapy for SRHB or PLADO for HRHB). Poor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy was seen in 5/23(22%). Two older patients (108 and 132 months) could not be resected while the remaining 21 underwent resection. Five of the 23 (22%) patients died while 2 who could not be resected discontinued therapy. Of the 21 resected patients there were 7 (33.3%) recurrences, of whom 3 are alive after salvage therapy, 1 died and 3 discontinued therapy with progressive disease. Exon 3 catenin gene deletion was detected only in a single patient who was a 11month old PRETEXT3 SRHB patient with good response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and is in CR after resection. No missense mutations in CTNNB1 gene were detected. No correlation was found between presence of mutation and response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy or ultimate outcome. Conclusions: Beta catenin gene deletion or mutation seems to be rare in hepatoblastoma in India and may not be important in pathogenesis of hepatoblastoma. P-338 Is Antibiotic Prophylaxis Beneficial: A Comparative Study in Totally Implantable Venous Access Devices S.A. Akbar Tarar1, A.Q. Philips hospital, Breast Surgery, Llanelli Carmarthenshire, Kingdom; 3Aga Khan University, Medical College, Karachi, Pakistan Background/Objectives: Totally implantable venous access devices (TIVADs) play an important role in administering chemotherapeutic agents in children with oncological disorders. This study aimed to analyze the efficacy of prophylactic antibiotic at the time of insertion of TIVADs in preventing early central line associated blood stream infection (CLABSI). Design/Methods: Consecutive patients with TIVAD insertion between January 2005 and June 2016 were reviewed retrospectively. There was a natural division of the patients into two groups due to change of surgeons in 2013 with a different surgical practice: Group A (n = 351) who received a single dose coamoxiclav before September 2013 and Group B (n = 279) did not receive it. CLABSI was defined as per CDC guidelines. Results: Both groups were comparable in terms of gender ratio, type of malignancy and neutrophil count with no major confounding factors. Mean age was significantly higher in the group that received antibiotic (68.7 versus 51.1 months, pvalue 0.038). The rate of CLABSI was slightly lower in the group that received antibiotic (11.6 versus 12.9%) but the difference was statistically insignificant (pvalue 0.365). The device was removed in first month in 17 cases (10/41 in group A and 7/36 in group B). Tip culture was positive in 10% in the group that received antibiotic as compared to 57% in the other group but the pvalue was insignificant (0.06), although the numbers were very small to assess. Conclusions: In our study there is no advantage of using prophylactic antibiotic at the time of TIVAD insertion in preventing early postoperative CLABSI. To establish this a prospective RCT is recommended. P-339 Advanced Hepatoblastoma with Tumoral Thrombi in Right Atrium and Inferior Vena Cava: Which is the Best Management? R. Angelico 1, Passariello2, M. Pilato3, Italy; 2University of Naples \"Federico II\" Naples Department of Translational Medical Science, Naples, Italy; 3IRCCS ISMETT Mediterranean Institute for Transplantation and Advanced Specialized Therapies, 4Cardiac Surgery and Heart Transplantation Unit Department for the Treatment and Study of Cardiothoracic Diseases and Cardiothoracic Transplantation, Palermo, Italy; 4IRCCS ISMETT Mediterranean Institute for Transplantation and Advanced Specialized Therapies, Radiology service, Palermo, Italy; with tumour thrombi extending into major vessels needs multimodal treatment approaches combining chemotherapy and surgery. Surgical recommendations for pretreatment extent disease (PRETEXT) staging IIIIV strongly advocate primary liver transplantation (LT). However, when tumour thrombi infiltrate the inferior vena cava (IVC) and the right atrium, LT might be technically challenging and it is associated with unfavourable survival rates for local recurrence HBL. Therefore, the best surgical approach is not clear and transplant surgeons are exploring technical alternatives. Design/Methods: A 11monthsold boy with serum alphafetoprotein(AFP) with tumour thrombi extending from the right hepatic vein into the IVC up to the right atrium, and bilateral lung lesions (PRETEXT III) was referred. After 8 months of chemotherapy (SIOPEL 2004high risk Protocol), HBL decreased to 61x64mm and lung lesions disappeared, but the tumour thrombi was still present. The child underwent ante situm liver resection: en into atrium. The IVC was replaced with fresh aortic graft from bloodgroup compatible cadaveric donor. During the resection, the remnant liver (SIIIII) was perfused through the portal vein with Celsior at 4\u00b0C, cooled with ice, and reimplanted by endtoside anastomosis of the left hepatic vein to the neoIVC. Results: The postoperative course was uneventful and after 10 months of followup the child is in good clinical condition with normal liver function test, AFP of 1.1UI/mL, free of disease recurrence and with patent aortic graft. Conclusions: This is the first case of ante situm liver resection combined with hypothermic CPB and IVC replacement for HBL, which is a realistic option to avoid LT for skilled transplant surgeons thanks to the improvement of LT technique. P-340 Comparative Cost Analysis of Treatment of Pediatric Solid Tumors in SemiGovernmental Hospital in India S. Bhatnagar 1 1B.J.Wadia Hospital for Children Bombay Hospital, Pediatric Surgery, Mumbai, India Background/Objectives: The rate structuring in hospitals in India show a huge fluctuation ranging from completely free of cost public hospitals (Government), charitable institutes with subsidized rates, semigovernment to autonomous, corporate/private hospitals/nursing homes with varying rate structures. The cost of treatment of pediatric solid tumors varies widely from one facility to another even within the same city. The parents concerns regarding the cost of therapy when child is diagnosed with tumor becomes very difficult to satisfy for multiple reasons, the foremost of which is lack of hospital based cost analysis data. Hence, study of comparative cost analysis with different modalities of treatment of solid tumors in children has been undertaken. Design/Methods: From the time the child is clinically detected to have solid tumor, the cost study has been performed by including cost of hospitalization (bed charges), cost of diagnostic studies, cost of chemotherapy stage wise, cost of surgery and related costs, cost of intensive care monitoring, cost of consumables, cost of radiotherapy, cost of supportive therapy, cost of immunization during treatment. The ancillary costs like accommodation, food and travel, loss of wages for parents, etc. have not been studied. The study has been undertaken taking into account most recent expenses at tertiary care semigovernment/charitable institute in Mumbai, India. Results: Of the overall expenditure for treatment, cost analysis for a stage 3 tumor showed the various costs as: Diagnosis 7%, Chemotherapy 8.5%, Supportive treatment 14%. Cost analysis tumor wise and stage wise revealed that with advanced disease, the cost of chemotherapy, intensive care and supportive care increased drastically. Conclusions: Costing is a crucial tool in counseling and stratifying the financial status of the parents, thus creating pathways to achieve completion of therapy even with the poor socioeconomic section of society. P-341 Outcomes of Pediatric Chest Wall Reconstruction Using a BioProsthetic Absorbable Material M. Collin 1, Children's Cancer Research Unit, Sydney, Australia Background/Objectives: Reconstruction in large chest wall tumours aims to create an airtight cavity, rigidity to protect thoracic contents, stability to permit respiration and longterm aesthetically acceptable results. Described techniques (using nonabsorbable prosthetics) have limitations, especially in prepubertal children in which growth deformity may result. We aim to review mediumterm outcomes when using bioprosthetic absorbable materials. Design/Methods: This retrospective series includes prepubertal children that have undergone chest wall reconstruction at our centre. PolyLlactide struts (to replace cartilage/bone structures) and a porcine dermal collagen patch with muscle flaps where available (to provide softtissue replacement) were used as a matrix for nativetissue ingrowth and allow complete implant resorption. Complications, functional and cosmetic results were obtained with review of photography and axial imaging. Results: Five patients were included; 4 males and 1 female, median age 4 years (range 010), median followup 3 years (range 14). Pathology included 2 Ewing sarcomas, 1 osteochondroma, 1 chondromesenchymal hamartoma and 1 highgrade spindlecell sarcoma. A median of 3 ribs were resected (range 14). The singlerib reconstruction (for osteochondroma) was required for significant adjacent rib displacement with a subsequent large thoracic defect. Four patients remain disease free while 1 patient suffered metastatic Ewing relapse (with local control persisting). Complications included a seroma at 2 months in one patient and a sterile collection at 8 months in another (both drained and resolved). The reconstruction provided good initial thoracic integrity enabling early extubation. Longterm cosmetic and functional results are satisfactory, with good chest wall shape and function. There were no postoperative restrictions on daily activities, including sport in patients old enough (4/5). Pitfalls include the lowlevel PET avidity of the prosthesis (when considering relapse surveillance) and the presence of mild scoliosis noted on imaging. Conclusions: The technique of a bioprosthetic absorbable chest wall reconstruction in the pediatric population has had good functional and cosmetic results. P-342 Outcomes of Brachytherapy in Pediatric NonRhabdomyosarcoma Pelvic Sarcomas M. Cancer Research Unit, Sydney, Australia Background/Objectives: Pelvic brachytherapy is well described in association with surgery for obtaining local control for rhabdomyosarcoma of the pelvis. Its primary benefits are as an organ sparing technique, whilst delivering high doses to the target volume. We describe our use of brachytherapy in the setting of nonrhabdomyosarcoma of the pelvis in the paediatric population. Design/Methods: Selected patients with nonrhabdomyosarcoma of the pelvis were treated at our institute with brachytherapy. Cases were identified from theatre databases and the data was collated as a retrospective audit to report the technique of brachytherapy, associated surgical procedure and outcomes including overall mortality, and morbidity including bladder and bowel function Results: Three female patients (age range 1118 months) have been treated with pelvic brachytherapy for nonrhabdomyosarcomas at our institute. Two cases involved preoperative brachytherapy to the tumour volume with transperineal catheters placed under image guidance. The third case involved postsurgical resection placement of a modified Frieburg flap applicator into the pelvis and sciatic notch. All 3 patients received high dose rate brachytherapy with excellent dose coverage of the target volume and organ at risk doses within set constraints. Two of the 3 patients have survived to 2 and 4 years post intervention with no evidence of relapse. The oldest child has maintained good bladder and bowel function despite some initial concerns of urinary incontinence, with ultrasound demonstrating good bladder capacity and voiding (managed well with timed and double voiding and subsequently continent). The second case remains too young to assess continence. There was one mortality in the remaining case who unexpectedly developed brainstem metastases six weeks post treatment. Conclusions: Our initial short to medium term follow ups indicate that the use of pelvic brachytherapy may be extended to nonrhabdomyosarcoma sarcomas of the pelvis in highly selected young children as an organ sparing technique. P-343 Biopsy and Excision of Pulmonary Metastasis in Children with ExtraCranial Solid Tumors: Current Practice at StandAlone Children's Hospitals K. Corkum 1, G. Ares1, E. Rowell1, J. Reichek2, T. Lautz1 1Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, Surgery, Chicago, USA; 2Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, Oncology, Chicago, USA Background/Objectives: Pulmonary metastases occur frequently in children with extracranial solid tumors, yet the optimal approach for evaluating and treating suspicious nodules remains unresolved. Lung biopsy and nodule excision may be indicated to stage disease, guide therapy, or achieve cure. The objective was to evaluate current national practices for addressing pulmonary nodules in patients with extracranial solid tumors. Design/Methods: The Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) database was queried from 20102015 for patients with extracranial solid tumors and associated pulmonary procedures. The approach and maximal extent of surgery were stratified by primary tumor location. Results: During the 6year period, 15,640 patients were hospitalized, of which 19.6% had pulmonary metastatic disease, and 8.1% underwent a pulmonary procedure. Most common primary tumors were bone (20.3%), soft tissue (14.6%), kidney (14.5%), adrenal (13.0%) and liver Biopsy occurred in 6.4% of patients and only 12.2% required further intervention with thoracoscopy/thoracotomy. Thoracoscopy was the firstline approach in 51.0% of patients, with only 12.2% of those patients requiring subsequent thoracotomy. Thoracotomy was the initial approach in 42.6% of patients, for which bone tumors accounted for half of the cases. Patients with bone tumors were also more likely to undergo multiple procedures than other solid tumors. Bone as a primary tumor site (OR 2.22), documented pulmonary metastasis (OR 2.80), highvolume center (OR 1.95), and anticipated lobectomy (OR 11.34) were predictive of thoracotomy. ICU utilization, mechanical ventilation, and postprocedural complications were more common in open cases compared to thoracoscopic or percutaneous approaches (p<0.001). Conclusions: At least eight percent of children with extracranial solid tumors currently undergo lung biopsy or resection. The approach and extent of resection varies by patient and hospital factors, including primary tumor site. Further effort is required to define the optimal workup and treatment algorithm for these patients to maximize diagnostic and therapeutic yield while minimizing complications. P-344 The Clinical Characters of NonRhabdmyosarcoma Soft Tissue Sarcomas\u2014A Retrospective Study in a Single Institution in 11 Years K. Dong 1, W. Tang1, X. Xiao1 1Children's Hospital of Fudan University, surgery, Shanghai, China Background/Objectives: Nonrhabdmyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas (NRSTS) is a heterogenous group of tumors and encompass many histology types, but they are less frequently encountered and account for 35% of all childhood malignancies.The purpose of the study is to summarize our experience in diagnosis and treatment on the nonrhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas. Design/Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of all the data of nonrhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas in our hospital in 20032014. Results: 56 cases were found in this period. Pathology study shows there were 8 types: and extraosseous Ewing's sarcoma. The case load 10(17.9%), 5(8.9%), 4(7.1%), 3(5.4%), 3(5.4%) and 1(1.8%), a difference about tumor location among sarcomas (P<0.01). There was no difference about the therapeutic protocols. (P>0.05) But radical operation and radical operation plus chemotherapy were the popular therapeutic protocols. There was a difference about the use of chemotherapy(P<0.01).The utilization of chemotherapy in PNET, malignant small cell sarcoma, acinous soft tissue sarcoma and embryonal sarcoma were 100%, while the utilization of chemotherapy were 42.7% in other four sarcomas. The 2year survival rate and 5year survival rate was 35.7%(20/56) and 8.9%(5/56), respectively. The case fatality rate within 2 years was 26.8%(15/56). Conclusions: Pediatric NRSTS had many histological subtypes. Although prognosis was not very good, radical operation plus chemotherapy have the effect of improving the survival rate in nonrhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas. P-345 Curative Surgical Treatment for Hepatoblastomas by Live Donor Liver Transplantation Combined with ICG Navigation Y. Fuchimoto 1, Y. Yamada1, K. Hoshino1, Y. Kitagawa2, T. Kuroda1 1Keio University School of Medicine, Pediatric Surgery, tokyo, Japan; 2Keio University School of Medicine, Surgery, tokyo, Japan Background/Objectives: The prognosis of hepatoblastomas depends greatly on curative treatment by surgical resection. We performed the world's first reliver transplantation using ICG navigation technology in a case of recurrent hepatoblastomas after liver transplantation. Design/Methods: The patient was a 15yearold boy, had undergone 2 hepatectomies after an explosion of hepatoblastomas when aged 8 years. At age 11 years he had a rescue living body liver transplantation for recurrence of the tumors, with his mother acting as the donor. His AFP level increased gradually in the 4 years after transplantation and a partial hepatectomy was performed because of tumor recurrence in the transplanted liver. We found a peritoneal dissemination at this operation and simultaneously resected the dissemination lesion, diagnosed pathologically as stumppositive. Because the AFP level increased postoperatively and a metastatic lesion was detected in the liver we resected the dissemination and intrahepatic metastatic lesion using ICG navigation technology. ICG was administered 3 days before the abdominal operation using Photodynamic Eye (PDER, Hamamatsu Photonics). The nodules of liver and revealed welldifferentiated fetal type hepatoblastoma. Results: Transplant intrahepatic multiple recurrences had occurred, thereafter we performed an exploratory laparotomy using ICG navigation for the purpose of considering the need for retransplantation. This showed that the dissemination lesion was controlled and confirmed that recurrence was localized to the liver. After the approval of the Ethical Review Board, we performed a reliver transplantation using ICG navigation, with the donor being the father. Pathology showed the tumor was localized in the liver with normal changes in AFP level. Conclusions: ICG navigation was useful in the detection of micro lesions not detected by imaging or the naked eye such as peritoneal dissemination and intrahepatic metastases. Liver transplantation combined with ICG navigation provided curative treatment for hepatoblastomas, indicating this was a potential new surgical treatment for these tumors. P-346 Diagnostic Utility of Frozen Section in Paediatric Testicular and Paratesticular Lesions H. Gabra 1 1Great North Children Hospital, Paedaitric Surgery, Newcastle Upon Tyne, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: Frozen sections are used routinely to assess suspected tumours in adults and aid surgical decision making. Similar application in paediatric tumours remains limited, especially in the evaluation of paediatric paratesticular lesions where diagnosis is reliant on clinical and imaging findings. Many benign paratesticular lesions in infancy and childhood may be difficult to distinguish from malignant lesions and result in unnecessary orchidectomy. Design/Methods: Retrospective of a series of 3 patients who underwent frozen section at the time of surgery for suspected testicular/ paratesticular lesions were reviewed. Clinical information including age, histological diagnosis were recorded. Results: Case 1: 11month old infant with a firm paratesticular mass not involving the testis. Rhabdomyosarcoma was suspected clinically and on imaging which was atypical. Intraoperative frozen section diagnosis confirmed a benign lesion (fibrous hamartoma of infancy). The mass was excised and the testis left in situ. Case 2: 14 year old boy who presented with a large complex paratesticular mass closely abutting the entire testis. Even though radiologically it was suspected to be benign, the clinical features were suspicious and orchidectomy was thought to be the most pragmatic option. Frozen sections showed dysplasia of the rete testis and epididymis, confirmed by standard histology with no malignant changes. Case 3: 9 year old with presented with chronic testicular pain, USS was suspicious of polar testicular lesion. Frozen sections showed normal histology and testis was spared. Conclusions: Frozen sections may accurately diagnose testicular and paratesticular masses. Though orchidectomy could be avoided only in case 1 and 3, frozen sections may aid surgical decision making with regards to sparing the testis in selected paediatric cases. Pathologists must endeavour to make themselves familiar with the potential advantages and limitations of frozen sections and the role of intraoperative frozen sections warrants further multidisciplinary evaluation. P-347 Laparoscopic Adrenalectomy in Children with Kerimov Kazancev1, D. Rybakova1 1Russian Cancer Research Center. NN Blokhina, Surgical separation of tumors of thoracoabdominal localization, Moscow, Russia Background/Objectives: laparoscopic adrenalectomy was introduced relatively recently and took the leading position in choosing the volume of surgery for adrenal neoplasm in children. Design/Methods: We present the results of treatment of 91 patients with various adrenal tumors in children aged 1 to 18 years who underwent 91 laparoscopic operations in the volume from 2007 to 2017: laparoscopic adrenalectomy (LA) on the right 50, LA on the left 41. Male were 50 patients, 41 female. The most common neuroblastoma was diagnosed in 71 cases, the ganglioneuroma was diagnosed in 9 cases, the following diseases were observed in single observations: adrenocortical adenoma 2, adrenal cortex cancer 1, neurinoma 1, fibroma 1. Results: The duration of operations ranged from 40 to 90 min. The average blood loss was 20 ml. The drainage tube was installed to the entire patient and was removed on the first day after the operation. The stay in the intensive care ward was 1 day. There were no lethal outcomes, cases of access conversion, serious intraoperative complications. We have not been diagnosed with any cases of recurrence of the disease or implantation metastases in malignant tumors of the adrenal gland. The median followup was 82 months. Conclusions: Laparoscopic adrenalectomy in children with adrenal tumor pathology is an effective and safe method that is accompanied by minimal surgical trauma and excellent cosmetic results, shortens the duration of the postoperative period and does not worsen the oncological prognosis. Laparoscopic adrenalectomy in children can be considered as the preferred surgery regardless of the age and body weight of the patient with both benign and malignant organ tumors. P-348 Epidemiology of Paediatric Solid Tumors and Treatment Challenges at a Tertiary Care Hospital in a Developing Country V. Khanna 1, R. Muffazzal1, S. Roy Choudhury1, P. Singh Yadav1, A. Puri1, R. 1Lady College & Associated Kalawati Saran Children's Hospital, Paediatric Surgery, New Delhi, India Background/Objectives: A study on epidemiology, treatment challenges and logistic difficulties in managing paediatric solid tumors. Design/Methods: Prospective observational study from February/2014 till January/2017 including all paediatric solid tumors. Results: A total of 101 patients (58males,43females) were included. Primary diagnosis was with WT requiring DD4A chemotherapy+Radiotherapy (COG protocol), 11(78.5%) could not receive radiotherapy due to lack of necessary infrastructure at our hospital, financial constraints and already overburdening of centres giving radiotherapy. Two patients, 1 with Clear cell sarcoma of kidney(CCSK) and other with Rhabdoid tumor of kidney(RTK) were given WT chemotherapy as they were reported as Wilms in initial histopathology reports. CCSK patient is alive with disease while RTK patient expired 2 months postsurgery. Out of 21 NB patients, 13(62%) were high risk. Low awareness and diagnostic delays rendered presentation to our hospital at a very advanced stage. Eleven(52.3%) NB patients died and 8(38%) are alive with disease. The salvage rate remains low due to limited access to myeloablative treatments with bone marrow rescue and biologic therapy. Two (14.2%) patients with SCT had recurrence which were detected late due to logistic difficulty in getting alphafetoprotein levels(AFP) done. Both these patients died due to febrile neutropenia in addition to their poor nutritional status on initiation of salvage chemotherapy. All five patients with HB, 3 standard risk(SR) and 2 high risk(HR) received PLADO. Three underwent surgery and are alive and disease free. Conclusions: Lack of education, poor government support system and referral facilities decrease survival in cancer patients in developing nations. The cancer treatment protocols are institutionalized depending on the availability of resources, technology and research at disposal. Multidisciplinary tumor treatment facilities with publicprivate partnership are the need of hour. P-349 Preoperative Blood Count Parameters and Prophylactic Antibiotics and their Effects on Early CatheterRelated Bloodstream Infections in Pediatric Cancer Patients Undergoing PortACath Loo Lin School of Medicine, Singapore, Singapore; 2KK Women's and Children's Hospital, Department of Paediatric Medicine, Singapore, Singapore; 3KK Women's and Children's Hospital, Department of Paediatric Surgery, Singapore, Singapore; 4KK Women's and Children's Hospital, Division of Nursing, Singapore, Singapore; 5KK Women's and Children's Hospital, Service, of Paediatric Subspecialties Infectious Diseases Service, Singapore, Singapore; 7Centre for Quantitative Medicine, DukeNUS Medical School, Singapore Background/Objectives: Prior to portacath insertions in pediatric cancer patients, preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis has been employed either routinely or based on blood count parameters, but the basis of this practice is not well studied. We aimed to analyse preoperative risk factors associated with early catheterrelated bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) in portacath insertions. Design/Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical charts of pediatric cancer patients who had portacaths placed between January 2009 and December 2015. Standardized skin preparation, implants, and technique were used on all patients, though preoperative antibiotic use varied. Demographics, disease factors, intraoperative factors, and preoperative blood count parameters were correlated with occurrence of early CRBSI within the first 30 postoperative days. Results: In total 279 central venous catheters were placed during the study period, of which 250 were portacaths. Among these, 159 (64%) had acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 15 (6%) had acute myleogenous leukemia (AML); 160 (65%) patients had preoperative antibiotics administered. Median preoperative absolute neutrophil count (ANC) was 1.18 (range: 0.27-15.5) x Fifteen CRBSIs occurred at median 14 (range: 8-28) postoperative days. Only cancer type was significantly associated with early CRBSIs (P=0.004); these were encountered in 8, 3, 2, and 2 patients with ALL, AML, other leukemias, and solid tumours, respectively. Notably, preoperative ANC <1 x 109/L and use of prophylactic preoperative antibiotics were not associated with occurrence of early CRBSIs (P=0.816 and P=0.996, respectively). Surgeon and operative factors were also not associated with early CRBSI. However, early CRBSI was significantly associated with early port removal within 30 days of insertion (P=0.009). Conclusions: Preoperative ANCs of 1 x 109/L, and use of preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis were not found to be associated with a lower incidence of early CRBSIs within the first 30 postoperative days. P-350 Testicular Transposition in Children Undergoing Brachytherapy for Rhadomyosarcoma De Lambert 1, F. V. MinardColin3, Background/Objectives: Fertility preservation is a major goal in children 's cancer. Spermatogonias are affected by a dose of 0.15 Gy and dose more than 4 Gy may lead to definitive sterility. Leydig cells are more resistant and endocrine function can be maintained after exposure to dose up to 20 Gy in prepubescent males. To describe a new technique of testicular transposition in patients treated with pulsedoserate brachytherapy for bladder neck and/or prostate rhabdomyosarcoma (BP RMS). Design/Methods: Medical records of consecutive patients treated between september 2016 and february 2017 were studied. These patients underwent a testicular transposition performed during BP surgery by the same suprapubic incision. The external oblique aponeurosis was not incised. The spermatic cord was mobilized up to the external inguinal ring and the gubernaculum attachments were delivered from the scrotum. The testis was then flipped over with care taken to avoid injury of the vessels or the vas, wrapped in a silicone material and sutured under the abdominal skin with a transfixing stitch facing the anterior superior iliac spine. At the end of brachytherapy, the testis was relocated in the scrotum during general anesthesia for removal of tubes and stents. Surgical outcome and dosimetric parameters were examined. Results: Five patients were identified. Median age was 25 months (range 22 - 80 months). All had embryonal BP RMS and received chemotherapy according to RMS 2005 protocol prior to local treatment. All patients underwent conservative surgery followed by brachytherapy (60 Gy) and could have testicular transposition of one testis. None of the patients had intraoperative or postoperative complication. Median radiation dose to the transposed testis was 3 Gy (range: 2 4.8) and 9 Gy (range: 6.6 11) to the testis left in place. Conclusions: Testicular transposition is feasible in order to potentially preserve fertility and future quality of life in children undergoing brachytherapy for BP RMS. P-351 Recurrent Inflammatory Myofibroblastic Tumor of the abdomen treated with Surgery and ALK Inhibitors in a Child S. Mishra 1, S. Jain2, S. Singh3, G. Kapoor2 1Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Research Hospital Sector 5 Rohini, Pediatric Surgical Oncology, Delhi, India; 2Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Research Hospital Sector 5 Rohini, Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Delhi, India; 3Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Research Hospital Sector 5 Rohini, Surgical Oncology, Delhi, India Background/Objectives: Extrapulmonary Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT), also known as inflammatory pseudotumor is a rare in children. IMT is known for its fibroinflammatory and pseusosarcomatous appearance on histopathology (HPE). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a useful tool in confirming the diagnosis. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment and local recurrences are common. We wish to share our experience with one case of recurrent IMT of the abdomen successfully treated with surgery and Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) inhibitors. Design/Methods: Retrospective review of hospital records. Results: Eleven years old boy presented with loss of appetite and vomiting for 3 months. He had a palpable left lower abdominal mass of size 8 x8 cms. Imaging confirmed a nonmetastatic mesenteric mass suggestive of a lowgrade spindle cell tumor on FNAC. He underwent en bloc excision of mass with segmental colectomy. HPE was suggestive of IMT. He was kept on close followup during which he developed a local relapse in the right abdomen after 7 months. Review of previous HPE revealed the IMT to be ALK positive on IHC in addition to SMA (diffuse +) and Desmin (weak +). He was started on Crizotinib and was closely followedup. There was partial response with 50% reduction in size which became static. After 9 months of Crizotinib he underwent laparotomy and resection of residual calcified mass in ileocolic bowel resection. HPE confirmed residual viable IMT. Postoperatively he was continued on Crizotinib for 6 months and is disease free at 6 months followup after last surgery. Conclusions: ALK positivity in abdominopelvic IMT is considered a favorable prognostic marker. In the absence of definitive adjuvant therapy for locally recurrent IMT, ALK inhibitors are a feasible option for targeted therapy of these rare tumors as evidenced by this case report. However there are no guidelines available for the duration of recommended treatment. P-352 Anterior Mediastinal Mass in Children Pathway for Safe Diagnosis R. Malik 1, D. Mullassery2, A. Atra1, B. Okoye2 1St George's Hospital 2St George's Hospital NHS Trust, of Paediatric Surgery, London, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: Anterior mediastinal masses pose a diagnostic challenge due to the cardiorespiratory risks associated with the mass which are exaggerated during a general anaesthetic for biopsy. We reviewed our institutional practice to assess the safety of our approach. Design/Methods: Retrospective case record review of all patients with an anterior mediastinal mass for diagnosis at our tertiary paediatric oncology and surgery centre. All patients admitted between January 2013 and December 2016 were assessed for comorbidities, clinical presentation, method of tissue diagnosis and complications. Results: There were 34 patients (median age 11.5 years, range 1 to 17 years, 21 male) admitted for diagnosis of AMM during the study period. Fifteen patients presented with respiratory symptoms. Eleven children had evidence of tracheobronchial compression on imaging. Histological diagnoses included Hodgkin's lymphoma rhabdomyosarcoma (1) and mediastinal metastasis from nasopharyngeal carcinoma (1). Sixteen patients had a lymph node biopsy. Alternative tissues (pleural fluid 4, peripheral blood film 3) were used for diagnosis in 7 patients. Eight patients had image guided core biopsy of the mediastinal mass and one patient had mediastinoscopic biopsy of paratracheal node. Ketamine sedation was used in 15 patients and 10 patients had a general anaesthetic. There were no anaesthetic complications. Four patients needed admission to PICU for tumour lysis syndrome. Two patients needed a repeat node biopsy ( 1 post steroid and one inadequate sample). Conclusions: Safe tissue diagnosis of anterior mediastinal masses can be obtained by a personalised multidisciplinary approach. Alternative tissue and local anaesthetic must be used when appropriate. Ketamine sedation is a good alternative for some high risk cases as it obviates the need for a full general anaesthetic. P-353 UltrasoundGuided Brachiocephalic Vein Catheterization Compared to Internal Jugular in Infants with Cancer at a Developing Country Setting R.C. Ribeiro 1, W.E. Oliveira J\u00fanior1, V. Kremer1 1Barretos Childrens Cancer Hospital, Pediatric Surgery Department, Barretos, Brazil Background/Objectives: Central vein catheterization is a challenge in infants even in experienced hands. US guidance has become the gold standard for central vein catheterization in the last two decades. USguided internal jugular vein (IJV) catheterization is generally the route recommended for children. Most of the studies concerning infants are on internal jugular vein or subclavian vein (SCV) catheterization in which technical success rates are lower than in adults and complications are frequent. Recent studies shows the use of the technique of ultrasoundguided supraclavicular brachiocephalic vein (BCV) catheterization in infants as a favorable approach providing high technical success and less complications. This study proposes to assess the degree of difficulty of vein catheterization by comparing the facility of guidewire progression in the ultrasoundguided brachiocephalic vein and internal jugular vein puncture. Design/Methods: Children who underwent BCV or IJV catheterization by the Pediatric Surgery Department at our Pediatric Oncology Hospital from December 2014 to March 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. Demographic features, disease, chooses vein, vein side, guidewire progression and complications were obtained. Guidewire progression were classified as easy or difficult. Results: A hundredfifty five procedures were performed, 68 on IVJ and 87 on BCV. Were evaluated eightyseven male patients (68 female), 108 with solid tumors (47 hematologic malignancies) with a median of 66 months of age and 21 kilograms. From IVJ patients, 21 had guidewire progression classified as difficult compared to 10 difficult progressions in the other group, showing statistic significance of BCV vein catheterization (pvalue: 0,0027). No major complications occurred in the BCV group. Conclusions: Ultrasoundguided brachiocephalic vein catheterization by supraclavicular is a easier way when compared to internal jugular approach in children. A possible explanation is because this technique enables visualization of the needle and the BCV in the longitudinal axis while preventing the vein from compression by the US. P-354 Association of Large Vessel Compression and Contralateral Extension with Operational Risks in the Resection of Wilms Tumors T. Oue 1, A. Yoneda2, M. N. Tanaka1, T. Sasaki1, N. Usui3, Pediatric Surgery, Nishinomiyashi Hyogo, Japan; 2Osaka City General Hospital, Pediatric Surgery, Osaka, Japan; 3Osaka Medical Center and Research Institute for Maternal and Child Health, Pediatric Surgery, Izumi, Japan; 4Osaka Univerity Graduate School of medicine, Pediatric Surgery, Suita, Japan Background/Objectives: In the USA and Japan, the standard treatment for Wilms tumor (WT) is primary resection followed by chemotherapy. However, in cases with large tumors, hemorrhage and tumor spillage due to rupture or its extension beyond the tumor capsule increase the surgical risk to patients. In such cases, chemotherapy should be administered prior to tumor resection. In the present study, we performed preoperative image analyses to identify factors associated with these surgical risks. Design/Methods: Twentynine patients with WT treated between 2000 and 2015 were enrolled in this study. Patient clinical records and image results, including computed tomography (CT) scans, were collected and retrospectively analyzed. Image factors, such as tumor size, tumor volume, relationship among large vessels, and contralateral extension of the tumor, were evaluated, and their relationship with surgical factors including operating time, hemorrhage, tumor spillage, and unresectability were analyzed. Results: Operating time and hemorrhage per body weight were significantly related with tumor size, area, and volume. Operating time was significantly longer and hemorrhages were significantly more in cases with compression of abdominal aorta and/or vena cava by the tumor (p = 0.0156, p = 0.0161, respectively) and extension of the tumor beyond the center of the vertebral body (p = 0.0124, p = 0.0323, respectively). Three patients had unresectable tumors and four had tumor spillage; tumors of these patients were more frequently associated with large vessel compression and contralateral extension. Conclusions: Besides the tumor size, large vessel compression and contralateral extension were significantly correlated with surgical risks. These factors are easily determined using CT images and are therefore useful in predicting the surgical risks and unresectability of tumors and deciding whether to use preoperative chemotherapy as a primary treatment strategy for large localized WT. P-355 Bowel Obstruction After Abdominal Surgery for Cancer in Children N. Pich\u00e91, J. C\u00f4t\u00e9 2, L. Canada; Joan de D\u00e9u, Pediatric surgery, Barcelone, Spain Background/Objectives: Pediatric cancer frequently affects intraabdominal organs and surgery is indicated for most cases. Few publications have addressed the complication of post operative bowel obstruction in that context. We analysed our data over a 10 year period to determine the frequency, etiology and treatment options of this complication. Design/Methods: Retrospective data analysis of all patients undergoing an abdominal surgery for malignancy between 2005 and 2015 in a tertiary pediatric hospital. Data collection included demographics, tumor characteristics, details of operative procedure, details of adjunct treatments (chemotherapy and radiotherapy), incidence of bowel obstruction and details regarding its management. Patients with obstruction were statistically compared to those without obstruction using chi -square and students' ttest with significance reported for p<0,05. Results: The analysis included 130 patients with a median followup of 3,5 years (mean 4y). A majority of patients were female (58%) with a median age at time of surgery for the entire cohort of 3,8 years. The most frequent diagnosis was Wilm's tumor (37%) followed by neuroblastoma (28%), hepatoblastoma (10%) and germ cells tumor (6%). The surgical approach was an open procedure in 95% of cases. Fifteen patients had a postoperative occlusion (11,5%): 13 cases of adhesions, 1 internal hernia and 1 SB volvulus. The mean operative time (396 min Vs. 311min, p=0,05) and mean blood loss (875ml Vs. 262 ml, p<0,01) was significantly higher for patients with bowel obstruction. Conservative management was attempted for all cases of obstruction with a success rate of 47% after a mean of 3 days. For 8 patients requiring surgical intervention, minimally invasive approach was successful for two patients. Conclusions: Bowel obstruction is a significant complication after abdominal surgery for cancer in children. Conservative management is frequently successful. For patients requiring surgical treatment, laparoscopy can be a valuable option. P-356 Solid Pseudopapillary Neoplasm of the Pancreas in Children: An Experience in Developing Country R. Ribeiro 1, V. kremer1, R. Balceiro2, W. Oliveira Jr1, Hospital, Cancer Hospital, Pediatric Oncology, Barretos, Brazil Background/Objectives: Pancreatic tumors are very rare entity in children. We reviewed the clinical and pathologic features of pediatric patients with pancreatic solid pseudopapillary neoplasm (PSPPN), also called as Frantz tumor, at a single institution. Design/Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the demographic data, clinical features, surgical approach, and longterm outcomes of all patients diagnosed with PSPPN between 2010 and 2016. Results: There were six patients during the study period with solid pseudopapillary neoplasm. All patients were female. The median age at presentation was 15 years (range: 11 to 18 years). Abdominal pain was the most presenting symptom shown in 4 girls. Preoperative imaging studies included computed tomography (all cases) and magnetic resonance imaging (3 cases). The median maximum diameter of the tumor was 56 mm with a range of 36 to 120 mm. None of the patients had evidence of metastasis at presentation. Regarding the pancreatic location, three patients had a pancreatic head tumor, two underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy and one nodulectomy; two girls the tumor was in tail and underwent distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy, one of those laparoscopic; and one patient had a pancreatic body tumor and underwent a distal pancreatectomy. We had only one late complication, related to a pancreatic pseudocysts treated with drainage and octreotide. On immunohistochemistry, chromogranin was negative in 4 cases of 5 analyzed, whereas vimentin were positive in all analyzed cases. Enolase was positive in three cases analyzed.No adjuvant therapy was done. All patients are alive and without evidence of disease on a median follow up of 28 months (3 to 71 months). Conclusions: We present our experience and longterm follow up data on children with PSPPN. In agreement with multiple clinical series, we believe that despite PSPPN generally has a benign behavior; complete resection with clear margins is mandatory to achieve the best longterm outcomes P-357 Surgery Options and Results of Treatment of Children with Solid Pseudopapillary Tumors of the Pancreas D. Rybakova 1, P. Kerimov1, A. Kazancev1 1Federal State Budgetary Institution \"Russian Cancer Research Center. NN Blokhin \"of the Ministry of Health of Russia, children oncology, Moscow, Russia Background/Objectives: Development rational surgery for solid pseudopapillary tumor (SPT) of the pancreas and implementation of Endosurgery. Design/Methods: 15 children with SPT were operated since 2004 to November 2016. We analyzed clinical data, operation options and results of treatment. Results: All patients were girls age from 9 to 15 years (median 13y.o.). Localization tumors in pancreas: in the tail - 5, in the body 6 and in the head 4. The size: 8.7 - 1.5 sm (M 4.6 sm). 5 children underwent laparoscopic distal resection with resection of the superior mesenteric vein and 1 Uncinate process of pancreas resection with resection of duodenal wall. Time of operations: 95 - 290 min. Bleeding: Complications occurred in 5 patients: in 3 cases - pancreatitis with pancreatic fistula, 1 bleeding from the pancreatic branch of the splenic artery after Whipple operation and 1 pneumonia. There were 2 reoperation for complications. The observation period of the patients was from 1 month to 8 years. All patients are alive without evidence of disease recurrence Conclusions: The main method of treatment is surgery, however there is a moderate risk of complications because of tumor localization. Great attention should be paid to the prevention of postoperative pancreatitis. A promising method is endosurgery providing early rehabilitation and cosmetic effects. P-358 Water Jet Dissection Technique for Liver Resections in Pediatric Oncology Surgery T. Sharoev 1, A. Prityko2, M. Rokhoev1, A. Kotlovsky3 1St Luka's Clinical Research Centre for Children Moscow Russia, Oncology, Moscow, Russia; 2St Luka's Clinical Research Centre for Children Moscow Russia, Administration, Moscow, Russia; 3St Luka's Clinical Research Centre for Children Moscow Russia, paediatric surgery, Moscow, Russia Background/Objectives: The water jet dissection technology (WJDT) is particularly advantageous in liver surgery for isolating major blood vessels adjacent to the tumor and also for sparing the surrounding hepatic parenchyma. In Russia we have pioneered the WJDT in pediatric oncology surgery. The objective of this review is to estimate the effectiveness of the WJDT for liver resections in children with hepatic tumors in our singlecentre practice. Design/Methods: From 2010 to 2017, liver resections of various anatomical types using the WJDT were performed in 25 children with hepatic tumors. Technologically, the ERBEJET in the ERBE VIO system was utilized. The patient data was prospectively collected and then analyzed, in particular considering tumor characterization and details of the surgical procedures. Results: The mean patient age was 4.3 years (from 2 weeks to 17 years). Malignant tumors were diagnosed in 22 cases. The following types of liver resections were completed successfully. Blood transfusions were required in 15 cases (60%). Postoperatively bile leak occurred in one patient (4%). No other complications related to the technique used were noted. The complete tumor clearance with negative surgical margins was histologically evident in all cases while the mean volume of the tumors removed was 413 cm3 and the maximum size 24 cm (in the largest dimension). Conclusions: In our experience the WJDT is a technically straightforward, safe and effective technique for liver resections of various anatomical types in children with hepatic tumors, in particular, in infants aged under 1 year. This technique allows provision of the reliable hemostasis while maximally sparing the hepatic parenchyma. We therefore believe that application of the WJDT should be widespread for liver resections in pediatric oncology practice. P-359 The Navigation Surgery Using Indocyanine Green Fluorescent Imaging for a Hepatoblastoma Patient R. Souzaki 1, Y. Kinoshita1, N. Kawakubo1, S. Ohga2, T. 1Kyushu university, Department of Pediatric Surgery, FUKUOKA, Japan; 2Kyushu university, Department of Pediatrics, FUKUOKA, Japan; 3Kyushu university, Department of Anatomic Pathology, FUKUOKA, Japan Background/Objectives: Navigation surgery using indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescent imaging for metastasectomy of lung and hepatectomy in hepatoblastoma (HB) patients has been reported. However, the usefulness of this surgery for HB has not been fully clarified. Furthermore, no cases using this surgical navigation during videoassisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for metastasectomy of the lung have been reported. We herein report experiences with surgical navigation for metastasectomy of the bilateral lung including a VATS procedure and hepatectomy in an HB patient. Design/Methods: In a PRETEXT III HB patient with bilateral lung metastasis following chemotherapy, a primary tumor and lung metastatic lesions were intraoperatively examined using a 10mm infrared fluorescence imaging scope after the administration of ICG preoperatively. Results: Navigation surgery using ICG fluorescent imaging was performed for an HB patient. The metastatic lesions were recognized by computed tomography (CT) in both lungs. The lesion in the left lung was 1.5 cm in diameter, so thoracotomy was performed for the left lung. For the right lung, VATS was performed. No lesions expect for those detected by CT were palpable in the left lung. Although only one lesion not detected by CT exhibited intense fluorescence in the right lung, all lesions detected by CT exhibited intense fluorescence. All of these fluorescencepositive lesions except for the one lesion of the right lung not detected by CT were pathologically proven to be made up of HB cells. None of the resection stumps for the metastectomies showed fluorescence, and all of the tumors were found to have been completely resected on a pathological examination. Although the liver tumor was strongly attached to the diaphragm, no fluorescencepositive lesions were seen at the diaphragm after resection. Conclusions: Navigation surgery using ICG for a patient with HB was useful for identifying metastatic lesions and confirming complete resection, even with VATS. P-360 Retroperitoneal Tumors and Congenital Vascular Surgery, singapore, Singapore; 2KK Women's and Children's Hospital, Department of Diagnostic and interventional Imaging, singapore, Singapore Background/Objectives: Congenital vascular anomalies of the abdominal great vessels are uncommon but can potentially impact surgical procedures and affect outcomes negatively, yet their incidence and clinical impact is poorly studied. We sought to assess the incidence of vascular anomalies of the abdominal great vessels in patients with retroperitoneal embryonal tumors, and study their impact on surgical and oncologic outcomes. Design/Methods: We retrospectively analyzed imaging, surgical, treatment and survival data of all pediatric patients with retroperitoneal tumors who underwent resection in KK Women's and Children's Hospital between January 2007 and October 2016. Preoperative scans were compared with corresponding intraoperative observations. Disease and treatment parameters, and survival outcomes, were compared using Chisquare test and KaplanMeier method, respectively. Results: Among 66 children studied, primary tumors arose from the kidney in 26 (39%), adrenal gland in 22 (33.3%) and paravertebral in 18 (27.3%) patients. Mean age at diagnosis was 3.7 years (S.D., 2.9). Vascular anomalies were found in 6 (9%) cases, namely renal (n=5) and adrenal (n=1) vessels. Interestingly, vascular anomalies were only associated with rightsided tumors (22.2%) and not leftsided tumors (P=0.023). Intraoperative complications were more common in patients with vascular anomalies (67%) than those without (15%, P=0.013). Complete tumor resection was achieved in 5 of 6 (83.3%) cases with vascular anomalies and 46 of 60 (76.7%) cases without. Relapse was more frequent in patients with vascular anomalies (n=2 (33%)) than those without (n=11 (18.3%)), but was not statistically significant (P=0.317). The presence of vascular anomalies, extent of resection, and intraoperative complications were not associated with overall and eventfree survival, but relapse was associated with overall and eventfree survival (P<0.001). Conclusions: Vascular anomalies of abdominal great vessels occurred in 9% of our patients with retroperitoneal tumors. Vascular anomalies were associated with higher rates of intraoperative complications and disease relapse but did not impact survival outcomes. Treatment and Care Radiation Oncology (PROS) P-361 Radiation Necrosis in Pediatric Patients with Brain Tumors Treated with Pencil Beam Scanning Proton Therapy B. Bojaxhiu 1, F. Ahlhelm2, M. Walser3, Proton Therapy, Villigen PSI West, Switzerland Background/Objectives: To assess the rate of radiationinduced radiation necrosis (RN) and white matter lesions (WML) and related neurologic symptoms in pediatric patients with primary brain tumors treated with Pencil Beam Scanning (PBS) proton therapy (PT) with or without concomitant chemotherapy at the Paul Scherrer Institute, Switzerland. Design/Methods: One hundred and seventyone pediatric patients (<18 years) with brain tumors were treated with PBS PT between 1999 and 2015. Median age at diagnosis was 3.3 years (range, 0.317.0). Post PT brain parenchymal alterations (WML and RN) were defined as a new area of abnormal signal intensity on T2weighted images or increased signal intensity on T2weighted images, and contrast enhancement on T1 occurring in the brain parenchyma included in the radiation treatment field, which did not demonstrate any abnormality before PT. The median followup period for the surviving patients was 49.8 months (range, 5.9194.7). Results: One hundred and twentyfour patients (72%) did not develop any parenchymal brain alteration after PT. Twentynine (17%) patients developed RN at a median time of 5 months (range, 126), most of them (n=17; 59%) being asymptomatic (grade 1). Grade 2, 4 and 5 toxicities occurred in 8, 2 and 2 patients, respectively. Eighteen (11%) patients developed WML at a median time of 14.5 months (range, 262), most of them (n=13; 72%) being asymptomatic (grade 1). Grade 2 and 3 toxicities occurred in 4 and 1 patients, respectively. The 5year RNfree survival was 83% and the WMLfree survival was 87%. In univariate analysis, chemotherapy (P=0.025), before (P=0.026) were significant predictors of RN. Conclusions: Children treated with PT demonstrated a low prevalence of symptomatic radiation necrosis (7%) or white matter lesion (3%). Chemotherapy administration before proton therapy, ependymoma, and hydrocephalus as an initial symptom were significant risk factors associated with radiation necrosis in these children with brain tumors. P-362 Role of Radiotherapy to Primary/Metastatic Sites in Pediatric Patients with Metastatic Rhabdomyosarcoma in the Bernie Study A. Cameron1, J. Chisholm2, Elze3, M. Casanova4, B. NHS Centre, Bristol, United Kingdom; 2The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, Children and Young People's Unit, Sutton, United Kingdom; 3F. HoffmannLa Roche Ltd, Innovative Pediatric Oncology 4Fondazione IRCCS Oncology, Villejuif, France; 6University College London Hospitals NHS of Oncology, London, United Kingdom; Medical Center EKZAMC, Department of Pediatric Oncology, Amsterdam, The Netherlands Background/Objectives: Local control is a key part of treatment of local/locoregional rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) and often involves radiotherapy with/without surgery. The role of radiotherapy in metastatic RMS is uncertain, with little published evidence to guide clinicians. We analyzed data from the BERNIE trial to assess the benefit of radiotherapy for patients with metastatic RMS. Design/Methods: In BERNIE (NCT00643565), patients aged 6 months to <18 years with metastatic RMS were randomized to receive chemotherapy with/without bevacizumab, surgery and/or radiotherapy (at cycle 6-9) then maintenance chemotherapy. Radiotherapy was recommended for all sites of metastases if feasible (investigator discretion allowed, resulting in variability in actual radiotherapy given). Patients were categorized into those receiving radiotherapy for all sites of disease, partial radiotherapy, and no radiotherapy. Eventfree survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models and a landmark approach: only patients who were event free at day 221 (i.e. end of cycle 9 +1 month) were included (EFS, n=85; OS, n=97). Variables adjusted for treatment (as randomized), disease type (alveolar/embryonal/other), risk group, age >10yrs, and metastatic lesion count (1, 2-3, 4+). The analysis was nonrandomized, exploratory, and post hoc. Results: Of 102 patients with RMS, 22 received no radiotherapy, 49 partial radiotherapy, and 31 radiotherapy to all sites. Baseline characteristics were mostly balanced; comparable proportions of patients received bevacizumab. Significantly longer OS (hazard ratio [HR]=0.249; 95% confidence interval were the radiotherapytreated group versus no radiotherapy. The 3year EFS and OS, respectively, were 9% and (no all sites). Conclusions: Radiotherapy in metastatic RMS was associated with significant OS benefits, albeit in small patient numbers. This should be confirmed in a prospective randomized trial. P-363 Paediatric Radiation Therapy Across Europe - A European Questionnaire Survey Supported by the SIOPE, ESTRO, PROS and Several National Paediatric HematologyOncology Societies 1, University of Antwerp, Radiation radiotherapy, Aarhus, Hospital, oncology, oslo, Norway; 16University Medical Center Utrecht - Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, radiotherapy, leipzig, Germany Background/Objectives: Increased focus has been made to improve the quality of care and access to European trials in paediatric oncology. Information about paediatric radiotherapy (PedRT) through Europe is not widely available. The aim of this study was to provide an overview of resources and organization for PedRT. Design/Methods: Experts in PedRT oncology were invited by email to complete a 21points questionnaire. Results: Sixtyeight answers from 24 countries (7 centres with proton) were collected and 16 centres were visited. A minority of radiation oncologists (11.74%) treat only children, which is in contrast with paediatric oncologists (93.44%) or surgeons (71.67%) who are more often dedicated. In 5 countries, pedRT is centralized in one centre. Access to pedRT formations in unequal through Europe even if everyone agree with the fact that specific knowledges are needed. Regarding the techniques, 12% use sometimes, meaning for some patients, 2D conventional radiotherapy, 4% still use Cobalt and 15% never rarely use IMRT (Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy), 64% use hypofractionated treatments, defined as at least 3Gy per fraction and 32% when considering 5 Gy or more. Eightyfour percent have access to paediatric devices for personalized immobilization. Radiation treatments can be easily delivered under anaesthesia in 75% of the centres if necessary, or under hypnosis in 9% of centres (2 countries). The environment is mostly adapted to children, with dedicated dedicated waiting area (47%), patient information (83%), gifts (98%), the possibility to listen to music or songs (93%) or watch cartoons (12%). Conclusions: This survey provides quantitative data demonstrating the current healthcare inequalities for children and adolescents who need radiotherapy in Europe. Nevertheless, an effort to guarantee a treatment of quality with the local environment has been pointed out. Acknowledgments: We thank European NaPHOS and paediatricians who contributed to disseminate the survey in their countries as well as every respondent. P-364 A French Multicenter Treatment Planning in Silico InterComparison: A Skull Base Rhabdomyosarcoma Radiotherapy Case A. Hangard2, Strasbourg, France compare 13 radiotherapy plans of a parameningeal alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma of the skull base in a 5yeargirl, optimized in ten centers with IMRT, VMAT, Tomotherapy or Proton therapy, and identify possible dose distribution differences. Design/Methods: Dose prescription was 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions on PTV1 (involved volume before chemotherapy) with a sequential boost of 5.4 Gy in 3 fractions in a reducted volume (PTV2). Six Tomotherapy, 4 VMAT, 1 IMRT step and shoot and 1 passive scattering Proton therapy plans were completed and compared. We also evaluated a commercially available treatment planning system (TPS) for a PT plan in Pencil Beam Scattering (RayStation provided by RaySearch Laboratories\u00ae). Comparisons were performed on the artiview system (Aquilab \u00ae). Results: All institutions achieved the planning objectives, with CTV and PTV1 and 2 V95 of 95% whatever the modality chosen. Mean conformity index (CI) for PTV1 and PTV2 were respectively 1.11 and 2.45 with VMAT, 1.24 and 2.78 with Tomotherapy and 1.31 and 2.95 with Proton therapy. Mean standard deviations (STD) for CTV and PTV low risk were respectively 1.57 and 0.71 with VMAT, 1.43 and 0.59 with Tomotherapy and 1.8 and 0.4 with Proton therapy. No significant correlations between chosen modality and DVH for targets and organs at risk (OARs) were observed. The optimization strategies selected by the planners played a key role in the delivered dose to the OARs. The cohort was too small to enhance a significant sparing of critical structures. Conclusions: In this complex pediatric tumor, the human factor and the constraints imposed to the target volumes and OARs have a greater dosimetric impact than treatment planning and radiation delivery technology. P-365 The Impact of Particle Therapy in Pediatric Tumors with Emphasis on Clinical Toxicity J.L. Habrand 1, D. Stefan1, S. oncology, Paris, France Background/Objectives: Assessing the impact of particle radiation therapy (PT) on toxicity and sequelae in pediatric and adolescent patients (pts) populations, through literature in the context of modern technologies, with emphasis on comparative clinical studies. Design/Methods: We performed an extensive review of published articles (pub), from 01/2005 through 12/2015 through MEDLINE, according to following keywords: Radiotherapy, English, Toxicity (acute & late sequelae), Novel technologies, excluding case reports, editorials, letters, inexploitable data. Our review concentrated on comparative studies between PT and photon therapy (XRT), with emphasis on clinical evaluations. Results: 128 pub were selected. Clinical studies represented 71/128 (55%), ranging from small (<20pts:19), to medium (<50pts:22), and XRT (1276 pts, one pub), or PT vs XRT (1,151 pts, 13 pub). 12/13 pub concerned protons (P), and 1/13 carbon ions (C). types of PT>XRT:8 pub (pS:6), XRT>PT:3 (pS); C=PT+XRT: 1 pub Conclusions: Few clinical comparative studies between PT and XRT were performed, and none randomized. Most PT were related with P, and only one with C. Impact on toxicity is still controversial although acute, endocrine and CNS/QOL tend to benefit most from PT. This early evaluation needs to be strengthened by further literature. P-366 Data Completeness is Directly Correlated with Funding Support in the Pediatric Proton Consortium Registry (PPCR) C.

Design/Methods: The PPCR is a consented registry residing on the NIHsupported REDCap platform that comprehensively integrates baseline demographics, insurance status, disease/health information, treatment details, proton radiation plan, followup vital status, late toxicity, and surveillance imaging. All participating sites offer enrollment to pediatric patients <22 years old. Sites were paid on a per capita basis until 6302015 when per capita funding ceased. We report patient numbers by diagnoses and how data field completeness varied by budget era. Results: By 32017, 1,634 patients were enrolled across 12 sites. The most common CNS (63%) and nonCNS Hodgkin lymphoma(60), chordoma/chondrosarcoma (51) and neuroblastoma (45). Eleven key registry fields including consent date, DOB, gender, race, referring MD, surgery, chemotherapy, RTrelated start date, site, field description, and total dose were examined. Missing data ranged from 01.4% per field before per capita funding ceased and 053% thereafter. Notably, demographic and diagnosis field completeness were unaffected by budget cuts, but treatment details were missing 3053% of the time. Followup data and vital status were missing 23% and 34% of the time before and after budget cuts. The relatively high rate (23%) of missing followup data prior to funding cuts, highlights the challenges of obtaining followup when patients are not locally followed at the proton center. Conclusions: The PPCR has now accrued significant disease specific patient cohorts that can answer important research questions. PPCR Site PIs remain engaged despite lack of resources prompting innovation of new data collection techniques. Innovative solutions for data collection efficiency include selective review of shared electronic medical records by centralized researchers aided by patient reported outcomes (PROs). P-367 Facial Growth Deformation Following Pediatric Head and Neck Sarcoma: Should Dose Constraints Regarding Specific Bony Structures Be Considered? M.L. Hol 1,2, J. L.

However, dose constrains related to facial bony growth have never been verified for specific facial bones. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relation between dose to facial bony structures and facial growth deformations. Design/Methods: This crosssectional multicenter study included 35 children treated for head and rhabdomyosarcoma (average treatment age:6years, range:114years) with EBRT or brachytherapy for whom the original radiotherapy planning and facial growth deformity data (mean followup of 10 years) based on 3D stereophotograph analysis were available. All bony structures within the field of view of the (reconstructed) planning CT scans were delineated, resulting in 712 delineated facial structures. For each delineated bony structure, the planned mean and maximum dose were analysed with regard to the growth deformity quantified for the corresponding facial part on the 3D stereophotograph. Results: Growth deformities were more severe in patients treated at a younger age than in patients treated when they were older. A correlation between growth deformities and dose indices was not found. However, overall more severe growth deformities were observed when the dose exceeded 24Gy. Some bony structures were more susceptible to growth disruption than others, for example the mandibular condyle and lacrimal bone exhibited more growth deformities after receiving the same mean and maximum dose than the frontaltemporal bone complex (both p<0.05). Conclusions: We found significant differences for the susceptibility to growth deformity between different facial bony structures. In the future, dose constraints for specific bony structures of the face might therefore be beneficial in pediatric radiotherapy to limit facial deformities. Further research based on a larger data set is needed to derive appropriate dose constraints for each facial bone. P-368 High Dose Rate (HDR) Brachytherapy in Childhood Rhabdomyosarcomas: Experience of a Single Center S. Kamer 1, A. Celik2, A. Avanoglu2, O. Ergun2, T. Medicine, Radiation Oncology, IZMIR, Turkey; 2Ege University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatric Surgery, izmir, Turkey; 3Ege University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatric Oncology, IZMIR, Turkey; 6Ege University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Neurosurgery, IZMIR, Turkey; 7Ege University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Radiation Oncology, IZMIR, Turkey Background/Objectives: Radiotherapy (RT) is an important component of the treatment in childhood rhabdomyosarcomas (RMS). Brachytherapy is a special irradiation technique which gives a possibility to protect surrounding healthy tissues and organs from unnecessary irradiation. The use of brachytherapy is favorable over external RT in particular sites of childhood RMS. In this study we present the results of the Ege University Hospital. Design/Methods: From January 2008 to October 2016, HDR brachytherapy was used as part of the treatment in 18 cases with RMS in Ege University Hospital. Median age was 6 (range: 317) and Male/Female ratio was 1.5/1. Localization of the tumors were vagina in 1 case, bladder in 8 cases, nonparamenengial head and neck in 3 cases, orbita in 4 cases, pelvic wall in 1 case and biliary tractus in 1 case. IRS III or IV chemotherapy regimens were used before RT. RT dose was 2436 Gy and a combined external and brachytherapy was used in 2 cases. Results: From January 2008 to October 2016, HDR brachytherapy was used as part of the treatment in 18 cases with RMS in Ege University Hospital. Median age was 6 (range: 317) and Male/Female ratio was 1.5/1. Localization of the tumors were vagina in 1 case, bladder in 8 cases, nonparamenengial head and neck in 3 cases, orbita in 4 cases, pelvic wall in 1 case and biliary tractus in 1 case. IRS III or IV chemotherapy regimens were used before RT. RT dose was 2436 Gy and a combined external and brachytherapy was used in 2 cases. Conclusions: Brachytherapy is effective in the local-regional control of childhood RMS. Careful planning of RT is extremely important for maximum benefit. Late effects need to be monitored for long term. P-369 Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma in Children: A Ten Year Experience with IMRT S. Laskar 1, A. Bindal1, N. Khanna1, Hospital, Radiation Oncology, India; 2Tata Memorial Medical Physics, Memorial Hospital, Bio Imaging, Mumbai, India; 6Tata Memorial Hospital, Pathology, Mumbai, India; 7Tata Memorial Hospital, Surgical Oncology, Mumbai, India; 8Tata Memorial Hospital, Palliative Medicine, Mumbai, India Background/Objectives: To evaluate the disease outcome in children with Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC) treated with Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) at the Tata Memorial Hospital. Design/Methods: Between 2005 and 2015, 95 children with NPC were treated at our Institute. The median age was 14 years [818 years]. Majority (92%) of patients had either T3T4 or N2N3 disease at presentation. They received neoadjuvant Chemotherapy (CTh) followed by IMRT and adjuvant CTh. Three clinical target volumes (CTV) were defined for IMRT. High Risk CTV (70.2 Gy/33 fr) included nasopharyngeal region and involved nodes, intermediate risk CTV (59.4 Gy/33 fr) included nodal regions adjacent to the involved nodes and low risk CTV (54.8 Gy/33 fr) included uninvolved nodal levels beyond Methotrexate and Cisplatin. Results: The locoregional control, diseasefree survival and overall survival for the cohort were 85%, 60% and 65%, respectively. At a median follow up of 33 mths (4148 mths), 53 (56%) patients remained alive & disease free. Three patients (3.2%) with regional recurrence alone were salvaged with reirradiation, surgery and CTh, and remain disease free. All patients with regional recurrence and distant metastases (11.6%) died of progressive disease. Twenty four (25.3%) developed distant metastasis only. Of them 4/24 (16.6%) with oligometastases were salvaged with RT and CTh and are disease free, while 2/24 (8.3%) remain alive with metastatic disease and 18/24 (75%) died of metastases. Four (4.2%) field defects and dental carries (20%) were the major toxicities. Conclusions: Combined treatment with IMRT and CTh resulted in acceptable disease control & toxicities. Distant metastasis remains a major cause of death in these children. P-370 Impact of Postoperative Abdominal Irradiation on Local Recurrence in Unilateral Intermediate and HighRisk Wilms Tumour (SIOP2001/GPOH) P. Hematology and Oncology, HomburgSaar, Germany Background/Objectives: To report the clinical outcome of children with Wilms tumour (WT) after multimodality treatment following the SIOP2001/GPOH protocol with special regard to radiotherapy. Design/Methods: Analysis of 175 patients with unilateral WT eligible for abdominal irradiation according to histological subtype and postoperative SIOPstage, treated between 2001 and 2015. Results: According to the SIOP2001 protocol 175 of 967 children (18.1%) were eligible for postoperative abdominal radiotherapy (PORT). The median follow up was 4.8 years. Median age at diagnosis was 3.4 years. There were 132 children with intermediate risk histology (IR) (stage III) and 43 children with high risk histology (HR) (diffuse anaplastic (stage II and III) and blastemal type (stage III)). 40 of 175 eligible patients were not irradiated. There were 18 abdominal relapses (10.3%) in the whole cohort. There were 6 local failures in 40 nonirradiated (15%) vs. 12 in 135 irradiated children (8.9%). In 4 patients, local relapse was the only site of failure. Most local recurrences (14 of 18) were combined with distant metastasis. Mean time to the first event was 0.98 years. Local recurrence occurred in IR in 3 of 30 (10%) nonirradiated vs. 5 of 102 (4.9%) irradiated patients, in HR in 3 of 10 (30%) nonirradiated vs. 7 of 33 (21.2%) irradiated patients. Twelve of 18 local relapses were localised in the flank, 8 infield failures and only 4 relapses outside the radiation field. The 5year local control was 91.6% in the irradiated vs. 84.3% in the nonirradiated group (p=0.29); 75.3% in HR vs. 94.5% in IR patients with PORT. Conclusions: Children with WT treated with a PORT have an excellent local control, especially for IR. Most local relapses occurred inside the radiation field and were combined with distant metastases. Further prospective analyses are necessary to evaluate new highly conformal radiation techniques. P-371 Radiation Dose and Let Distributions in Pediatric Craniopharyngioma Patients with and Without RadiationInduced Cerebral Vasculopathies A. Pica1, CPT, Villigen, Switzerland Background/Objectives: The study aims are: a) to report two cases of radiationinduced vasculopathies (RIV) after pencil beam scanning (PBS) proton therapy (PT) for pediatric craniopharyngioma patients and b) to evaluate local dose and linear energy transfer (LET) distributions for these RIVs. Design/Methods: We reviewed a series of 16 patients treated at Paul Scherrer Institute (median dose 54 GyRBE). Two (13%) out of 16 patient showed RIVs (one stenosis of right ICA and one progressive multifocal RIV in the region of the circle of Willis, 14 and 24 months after irradiation, respectively). A control group (no RIV) was selected based on the same fields' arrangement and the tumour size. CTs and MRIs pre and post PT were used to contour organs at risks (OARs; bilateral ICAs and circle of Willis). DVH parameters and dose distributions were analysed. Dose weighted LET distributions (Gy * keV/mm) and LET distributions were analysed. Results: Dose distributions for patient in the control group and presenting with RIV did not show any significant difference in terms of target coverage and OARs sparing, while RIV structures have a lower Dmean,without significant difference in the Dmax and in the D2%. Both patients presenting with RIV toxicities were treated with ipsilateral fields, thus resulting in marked asymmetric LET distributions. Despite high LET areas at the distal edge of the PTV, no significant differences were found in the maximum and mean LET values for the RIV between patients with toxicities and control patients. Conclusions: Quantitative analysis was not able to show significant correlations between delivered dose, LET and RIV. Ipsilateral planning approach seems to have an impact in the presence VT toxicity. This approach is generally less dosimetrically robust than the other one and it results in asymmetric LET distributions, with high LET values at the contralateral distal edge of the PTV. P-372 Optimizing Technique and Technology and Cost of Radiotherapy for Management of Childhood Cancer: Experience from Regional Cancer Centre in India (A Low and MiddleIncome Country) V.K. Ramaiah 1 1Kidwai Cancer Institute, Radiation Oncology, Bangalore, India Background/Objectives: Cobaltbased conventional technique (CCT) to linear accelerator based conformal radiotherapy (3D CRT) / particle therapy with or without incorporating adoptive technology for regular position verification are the different modalities that may be available with unpredictable variability for radiotherapeutic management of childhood cancers in developing countries. Radiation portals or tumor targets can be delineated by conventional uncalibrated xray, xray / fluoroscope with simulator scale or any of 3D imaging. Inexpensive soldering lead wire placed on the border of radiation portal and over the every centimeter mark on adhesive tape can be utilized to customized radiation field. Need for sedation / anesthesia is mostly patientdependent rather than the technology itself. Advanced radiotherapy techniques and technology have reduced longterm sideeffects due to dosimetric improvement without alteration the tumor control. We do not have large longterm outcome results of resourceintensive novel radiotherapy technology and techniques. In such scenario, affordability and waiting time are the two main factors determining the type of radiation technology utilization in particular patients in lowresource setting. Design/Methods: Retrospective analysis of radiation registers of pediatric patients with cancer treated between 2012 and 2016 at Kidwai Cancer Institute, Bangalore Results: 8% (85) of all patients undergoing radiotherapy was pediatric patients in our center. >1/2 (45) of all pediatric patients were diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and had undergone prophylactic cranial irradiation. 59 (69%) and 22 (25%) were treated by CCT and 3D CRT.Cost of radiotherapy of children with cancer for the same period was Indian National Rupee 962500 i.e. 5.3% of total money spent on radiotherapy for all patients. Conclusions: CCT still appears to be provide inexpensive treatment for large number of pediatric patients with cancer. 3D CRT has benefit of sparing normal tissue in intracranial, intrathoracic and intraabdominal tumors and for doseescalation to boost local tumors.

Vishwanath1 1Kidwai Cancer Institute, Radiation Oncology, Bangalore, India Background/Objectives: Radiotherapy simulation is a process where treatment is simulated but not really given. Radiation portals are defined during simulation after patient positioning and defining target area / region for subsequent irradiation. Simulation can be achieved by done by conventional simulator or 3dimensional computed imaging. However, in severely resourceconstrained setting, Co60 teletherapy equipment may be the only available radiation equipment for management of patients. Surface anatomical marking are the only landmark utilized for radiation portal placement. Conventional Xray without scale may be of little help without optical distance indicator and cross hair scale to account for magnification. There is a need to improvise radiation simulation with the available technology in resourceconstrained developing countries. To this effect, we simulated children with cancer by utilizing customized soldering lead wire scale, portal lead marker and conventional xray. Design/Methods: Hemilength of adhesive porous plastic surgical tape was stuck on to scale and small bits of soldering lead wire was placed at a distance of 1 centimeter. Radiation portal was marked manually by utilizing anatomic surface landmark and lead markers placed on all the borders of this portal with the help of same adhesive tape. The customized scale was stuck on to the body within field of view of Xray. Patients were subjected to xray and radiation portal was redefined based on the images of scale on xray film. Results: In the absence of any kind of simulator, we were able to plan almost all children with cancer presenting to our centre. Positional and rotational movements and other errors of maginification may be taken care of by corresponding the xray defined portal with surface anatomic landmarks. Conclusions: Our is one of the first study to report successful radiotherapy simulation of children with cancer by customized simulation technique in acutely resourceconstrained developing countries P-374 Radiotherapy Under Anaesthesia of Children with Cancer in Developing Countries: Simulation and Treatment Under Dissimilar Conditions is the Source of Geometric Tumor Miss V.K. Ramaiah1, S. Bhasker 2 1Kidwai Cancer Institute, Radiation India; 2All India Institute of Medical Scieces, Radiotherapy, New Delhi, India Background/Objectives: Children with cancer needing radiotherapy as part of multimodality therapy are sometimes not cooperative for radiotherapy immobilization, simulation and / or treatment. Counselling, sedation, general anesthesia or combination of these are generally prescribed to prevent movement of children during radiotherapy immobilization, simulation and treatment. Sometimes, patients are cooperative / noncooperative to one or more steps of radiotherapy process. Such situation creates dissimilar condition between steps of radiotherapy planning and treatment that in turn manifest as nonoverlap between the simulation position and treatment position. Muscle relaxation after anaesthesia is the main reason for such positional mismatch between two different steps of radiotherapy process. Our paper discuss of this mismatch between various steps of radiotherapy and devised methods to minimize such mismatch for radiotherapy planning and delivery using thermoplastic immobilization device. Design/Methods: Patients are immobilized in hospital area without anaesthesia after appropriate counselling of patients that is different from the area of simulation and treatment in resourceconstrained. Patients were immobilized by immobilization device during the whole process of radiotherapy and assessed for snugness of fit of immobilization device. Results: Anaesthesia induced muscle relaxation is responsible for loosening of immobilization and subsequent geographical tumor miss. Conclusions: Whole radiotherapy process of children with cancer has to be carriedout under similar circumstances .i.e. all process to be done under anaesthesia or all process to be carriedout without anaesthesia to avoid geometric miss of tumor during radiotherapy P-375 Ripetitive Pediatric Anesthesia in a Hospital Based Proton B. Rombi 1, S. Vennarini1, D. Pedrotti2, (PBT) requires wellorganized daily setting of a multidisciplinary team with high degree of competence during the induction and recovery phases for several weeks. Typical cases for PBT due to setup and treatment complexity usually require longer S/A comparing photon based sessions. Our preliminary experience with A/S by age and gender in children receiving daily PBT is reported. Design/Methods: Records of 42 pediatric patients (18 years) were reviewed between June 2015 and March 2017 at Proton Therapy Center APSS, Trento (Italy) of whom 17 received PBT under A/S. All patients were treated for CNS tumors. Results: Fourteen (83%) children aged 6 years and three (17%) patients aged 7-9 years received daily A/S for a median number of 30 fractions. Seven (41%) patients with median age 7 years received craniospinal irradiation (CSI) under sedation while the following local primary boost was performed without anesthesia after a week of dedicated training. Total time under anesthesia ranged from 30 to 90 minutes for more complex cases (i.e. CSI) with the use of Propofol. There were no deaths. No cardiopulmonary resuscitation or aspiration was required. Less serious events were more common with O(2) desaturation below 90% for more than 30 s and central apnea or airway obstruction occurred in 0.5% of the 568 sedation/anesthesia administrations. No stridor, laryngospasm or vomiting was reported and excessive secretions occurred in 0.2% of cases. No unexpected admissions were required Conclusions: The occurrence of undesired effects of A/S in our experience was very low. A strong emphasis on teamwork may have contributed to this favorable event rate. A/S can be safely implemented in a technically and clinically complex PBT context. P-376 Potential Reduction of Acute Hematological Toxicity in DualPhase Craniospinal Proton Therapy for Pediatric Oncology, Rome, Italy Background/Objectives: To evaluate acute hematological toxicity during craniospinal irradiation (CSI) with proton therapy (PT) for children with highrisk (HR) medulloblastoma after intensive myeloablative chemotherapy (CHT). Design/Methods: We evaluated haematological toxicity in ten pediatric patients (average age 7, range 49), who underwent CSI from February to December 2016. All patients received the last CHT cycle with carboplatin at 550 mg/m2 one month before irradiation. All patients completed PT at a total dose of 36GyRBE in two phases without interruption: a first phase (20GyRBE) including the whole vertebral body and a second phase (16GyRBE) to spinal cord excluding the vertebral body. Two patients were administered oral temozolomide at 75 mg/m2/day during the treatment. White blood cells (WBC), hemoglobin, platelets and absolute neutrophil (ANC) were counted preCSI, at the end of the first phase (middleCSI) and at the end of the second phase (endCSI). Paired Ttest was applied to statistically compare (p<0.05) values at the different phases. Results: WBC significantly decreased preCSI (median 2.81\u00d710^9/L, range 1.47.4) significantly increased at endCSI (2.34, 1.44.4) to values not significantly different form preCSI. Hemoglobin did not significantly change from preCSI (median 266.9\u00d710^9/L, range 128409) to middleCSI (144, 99185), and then significantly increased at endCSI (183.2, 137214) but to values still significantly lower than preCSI. ANC decreased from preCSI (median 1.37\u00d710^9/L, range 0.33.9) to middleCSI (0.85, 0.51.3), and then significantly increased at endCSI (1.49, 0.63.2,) to values not significantly different form preCSI. Conclusions: Due to the distal falloff, PT can effectively deliver dualphase CSI, with only limited dose to the vertebral body (around 20GyRBE) that can reduce acute hematological toxicity during treatment. It could be useful in reducing also longterm growth impairment. P-377 PreOperative IntensityModulated Sarcomas in Children: of Childrens Oncology Group (COG) Study ARST0332 A. Rao 1, Q. Chen1, Million2, K. Morano5, S. Terezakis1 1Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Radiation Oncology and Molecular Radiation Sciences, Baltimore, USA; 2Stanford University School of Medicine, Radiation Oncology, Palo Alto, USA; 3Stanford University School of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Palo Alto, USA; 4University of Massachusetts Medical School, Radiation Oncology, Worcester, USA; 5IROC Rhode Island, UMASS QARC, Lincoln, USA Background/Objectives: We assessed tumor coverage and dose to bone and skin in pediatric patients treated with IMRT vs. 3DCRT on ARST0332. Design/Methods: Of the 551 eligible patients, 200 were enrolled in Arm D of ARST0332 in which patients age<30 years received neoadjuvant ifosfamide/doxorubicin and 45 Gy, surgery, and an RT boost based on margins. 121 RT plans were available for remote review through the Imaging and Radiation Oncology Core (IROC) Rhode Island database. Of these, 56 patients had extremity STS and 54 were in proximity to a long bone (humerus/femur/tibia). The dose delivered to the clinical target volume (CTV), skin (contoured from the surface to depth of 5 mm), and infield bone was analyzed. Results: Thirtyeight patients (65%) received 3DCRT and 18 (32%) received IMRT. There was no difference in distribution of site treated with IMRT vs. 3DCRT with the exception of 0% vs. 11% of patients treated with IMRT vs. 3DCRT to upper arm STS. There was no difference in CTV volume between patients treated with IMRT or 3DCRT (p=0.920); however, IMRT resulted in significantly improved CTV coverage with 100% of the prescription dose compared 3DCRT (median CTV coverage, 95% vs. 87%, p=0.011). In patients without skin bolus, skin V45Gy was significantly lower in patients treated with IMRT compared to 3DCRT (mean percentage, 3% vs. 8% respectively, IMRT 63.8%, p=0.014) compared to 3DCRT. There was no difference in higher doses to bone (V30/V40/V45) between radiation techniques. Conclusions: Preoperative IMRT compared to 3DCRT may result in improved RT target coverage with reduced dose to the skin, but with increased low dose exposure to infield bone. Future studies should assess if these dosimetric findings translate into differences in clinical and toxicity outcomes. P-378 Feasibility and Toxicity of Simultaneously Administrated Chemotherapy and Proton Therapy in Children and Adolescents E. Sch\u00fcrmann 1, S. Tippelt1, N. Siegler1, R. Mikasch1, Oncology Hematology, Essen, Germany; 2University Hospital Essen, West German Proton Therapy Centre in Essen WPE, Essen, Germany Background/Objectives: Proton therapy (PT) is a promising alternative in radiotherapy of solid tumors in eloquent regions. While most recent studies deal with the outcome or long term side effects of PT, the aim of this study is the investigation of feasibility and acute toxicity of the simultaneous chemotherapy (CT) and PT. Design/Methods: This retrospective study enrolled all consecutive patients at age <18 years treated at the West German Proton Therapy Center in Essen, Germany, between September 2013 and December 2016. Based on the PT Registry and the patients' records data about patient's characteristics, pretreatment, recent treatment and acute adverse events (AE) were collected and analyzed. Results: Twohundredninetythree children (169 male, 124 female, median age 6.3 years) suffering from CNS tumors (n=166, 56.6%), sarcomas (n=92, 31.4%) or other tumor entities (n=35, 11.9%) received in total 294 PT cycles. PT was performed in 202 patients (68.7%) at primary treatment and in 92 (31.3%) at recurrence. 131 (44.6%) patients received a simultaneous CT. Severe AE (SAE, CTCAE\u00b03/\u00b04) were observed in 130 (44.2%) PT cycles, and were mostly hematotoxicity (n=105; 80.8%) and infections (n=28; 21.5%). Seventythree hospitalizations due to an unexpected event (mostly infections, mucositis, electrolyte imbalance) were necessary in 54 out of 294 PT cycles. In the group with simultaneous CT 53 patients (40.5%) could not receive the recommended CT dose or time schedule. The frequency of SAE was significant higher in the group with simultaneous CT than in the group without (71.8% vs. 22.1%, \u00b2 test, p<0.001). Conclusions: With regard to the increasing number of children in the PT centers in Western Europe, our data demonstrate the requirement of a well experienced interdisciplinary team and an adequate infrastructure for management of complex patients regarding infectious, neurological, endocrinological problems and especially the individual adjustment of a simultaneous chemotherapy. Supported by German Children's Cancer Foundation P-379 Proton Beam Therapy for Childhood Cancers: A Case Series of Shizuoka Cancer Center and Children's Hospital Collaboration K. Watanabe 1, Y. Ishida2, S. Yurikusa1, H. Kitazawa1, H. Kato2, Nagaizumi, Japan Background/Objectives: Proton beam therapy (PBT) offers more precise targeting than conventional photon radiation therapy and may limit radiation exposure to normal tissue. Therefore, PBT has been increasingly applied for treatment of childhood cancers in an attempt to reduce treatmentrelated longterm toxicities such as second malignancy. Cooperation of a pediatric oncology team with a PBT facility is crucial to include PBT in a context of multimodal management of children with cancer. We have applied proton therapy for childhood cancers in close collaboration between a cancer center and children's hospital in Shizuoka prefecture in Japan for more than 10 years. Design/Methods: From April 2005 to February 2016, 35 children with cancer in Shizuoka Children's Hospital referred to Shizuoka Cancer Center to receive PBT. We reviewed their medical records and retrospectively analyzed clinical data and outcome. Results: The median age at the time of receiving PBT is 5 years old (range:116). Ten patients were female. Twentyseven patients (77%) had central one with choroid plexus carcinoma received proton beam CSI. The irradiation dose ranged from 19.6 to 67.2 GyE (mostly in 1.8GyE/fr). Twentyseven patients (77%) were alive at the median follow up of 63 months (range: 4134). There were no severe acute toxicities. Conclusions: PBT may be applied effectively and safely to treatment of various childhood cancers under close collaboration between a regional cancer center and children's hospital. Further study is needed to elucidate longterm complications of PBT in patients with childhood cancer. Treatment and Care New Drugs/Experimental Therapeutics P-380 Caffeine Citrate is a Novel Candidate Enhancing PlatinumBased Chemotherapy for Sarcoma K. Abe 1, N. Yamamoto1, K. Hayashi1, A. Takeuchi1, 1Kanazawa University, Orthopaedic Surgery, Kanazawa, Japan Background/Objectives: The prognosis in patients with sarcoma has been dramatically improved by multiagent chemotherapy. However, the chemotherapeutics have hardly changed for 30 years. We developed caffeinepotentiated chemotherapy for musculoskeletal sarcoma in 1989 and have reported the excellent response and oncological outcome. Even with this excellent result, it was difficult to conduct an initiated clinical trial without patent. Citric acid was also reported that it could enhance the cytocidal effect of cisplatin in gastric cancer. So, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the cytocidal effect of cisplatin combined with caffeine citrate compared to cisplatin combined with or without caffeine and citric acid. Caffeine citrate is a newly emerged candidate enhancing anticancer agents. Design/Methods: We used human osteosarcoma and fibrosarcoma cell lines (HOS and HT1080). These cells were treated with cisplatin combined with or without anhydrous caffeine, citric acid, and caffeine citrate. Cell survival ability, cell proliferation, and mitochondrial membrane potential were assessed by WST8 cell proliferation combination index (CI) of caffeine citrate was calculated as a combination of anhydrous caffeine and citric acid, and the synergy was evaluated (CI<1.0). Results: In all assays, cisplatin combined with caffeine citrate significantly reinforced the anticancer effect compared with cisplatin alone, combination of cisplatin and anhydrous caffeine, and combination of cisplatin and citric acid (P<0.01). Moreover, CI was <0.1 in all conditions. The anticancer agent reinforcement effect of caffeine citrate was synergy of anhydrous caffeine and citric acid. These results were observed in both cell lines. Based on these results, we have filed a patent application. Conclusions: This is the first report that cisplatin combined with caffeine citrate showed a significant greater effect. Although further analysis is mandatory, this novel treatment expects to ameliorate the prognosis of the patients with sarcoma. P-381 FDA Written Requests: Identified Trends in Timelines and Drug Types A. Barone 1, D. Casey1, G. Reaman1 1FDA, Office of Oncology and Hematology Products, Silver Spring, USA Background/Objectives: The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act authorizes the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to request pediatric studies of a drug in approved or unapproved indications via a Written Request (WR). Fulfillment of the WR provides a company with a sixmonth marketing exclusivity for the entire drug moiety. Historically, WRs were issued following approval for an adult indication. Our objective was to identify trends associated with WRs issued by FDA for oncology products with regard to time of issue within the drug development program, time to completion, and drug class types. Design/Methods: A review of FDA's Document Archiving, Reporting &Regulatory Tracking System was performed to identify WRs issued for oncology drugs. WRs were reviewed for milestone dates, amendments, and status with regard to exclusivity determination. Results: Between 2000 and 2016, 58 WRs were issued for oncology products and 45 were accepted. Overall, the proportion of WRs issued prior to the marketing approval of a drug was 24% compared to 43% in 2016. Seventeen oncology products were granted exclusivity upon completion of the studies outlined in the WR. The average time from issuance of a WR to exclusivity determination was 4.5 years. WRs were issued for cytotoxic (N=22), immuneoncology (N=7), and targeted (N=16) therapies. Between 2011 and 2016, the proportion of WRs issued for targeted and immuneoncology therapies combined (84.4%) was greater than that for cytotoxic drugs (15.5%) Conclusions: The WR is a powerful tool that can expedite early evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of relevant drugs for pediatric cancers. A modest increase was observed in the proportion of WRs issued prior to marketing approval of a drug in recent years. The increased investigation of targeted and immuneoncology therapies reflects the changing landscape of cancer treatment in pediatric patients. FDA encourages parallel drug development programs when appropriate for adult and pediatric cancer indications. P-382 The Efficacy and Safety of Allium Porrum in Reducing Neutrophil Recovery Time in Childhood Cancer with Febrile Neutropenia M. Bordbar 1, M. O. Zekavat1, M. Karimi1 1Shiraz University of Sciences School of Medicine, Pediatric HematolgyOncology, shiraz, Iran; 2Shiraz University of Medical Sciences School of Medicine, Pediatrics, shiraz, Iran Background/Objectives: Febrile neutropenia is frequently observed in cancer patients following chemotherapy. Experimental animal studies have shown the potential benefits of the herbal agent \"Allium Porrum\" in boosting the immune system. However, such findings have not been confirmed in human subjects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of allium extract on bone marrow recovery time in children with cancer suffering from febrile neutropenia. Design/Methods: In this randomized doubleblind clinical trial, 107 children with different kinds of cancers in the age range of 218 years who were admitted due to fever and neutropenia were enrolled. All the patients were given supportive care including broadspectrum antibiotics, and granulocytecolonystimulatingfactor (GCSF). Those in the treatment group were treated with 500 mg Allium extract in the form of capsule twice daily for 7 days. The patients in the control group were treated similarly with placebo capsules. Total white blood cell (WBC) and absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) were checked on a daily basis and bone marrow recovery time in both groups were compared. Results: WBC and ANC were not significantly different in the 2 groups. Patients in the treatment group experienced shorter neutrophil recovery compared to the control group (4.02 \u00b1 2.32 days vs 6.38 \u00b1 2.80 days respectively, P0.001). Patients in the treatment group were discharged from the hospital 2 mean days earlier than the control group (7.54\u00b15.66 days vs 9.66\u00b18.58 days), but it did not reach statistical significance (P=0.133). The drug was well tolerated and no adverse effect was reported. Conclusions: Allium may effectively reduce ANC recovery time leading to earlier discharge from hospital. The drug is safe with no serious adverse effect reported. Larger multicenter studies are required to confirm its efficacy and safety. P-383 Implementation of a Precision Medicine Program in Pediatric Oncology: Prospective Feasibility Study at Relapse/Progression in Spain P. Berlanga1, Pedrola2, A. La Fe, Pediatric Oncology Unit, Valencia, Spain; 2La Fe Hospital Research Institute, Genomic Unit, Valencia, Spain; 3Hospital La Fe, Department of Pathology, Valencia, Spain; 4Hospital La Fe, Genetics Unit, Valencia, Spain; 5La Fe Hospital Research Institute, Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Biology Center of Translational Medicine, Valencia, Spain; 6Hospital La Fe, Pediatric Surgery Department, Alicante, Pediatric Oncology Unit, Alicante, Spain; 8Hospital La Fe, Department of Pharmacy, Valencia, Spain Background/Objectives: To evaluate the integration of advanced genomic sequencing technologies in the clinical management of pediatric/adolescent patients with progressive/relapsed cancer in Spain. Design/Methods: Consecutive case series of all patients 18 years with recurrent solid tumors included in a precision medicine research project were analyzed. This project was developed in our institution and open for recruitment of patients from other centers. New tumor sampling at progression/relapse was recommended. Tumor profiling was perfomed using two commercial Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) cancer panels: Ion AmpliseqTM Cancer Hotspot Panel v2 (before December 2015; only for tumor samples) and Human Comprehensive Cancer GeneRead DNAseq Targeted Panel (since January 2016; for paired blood and tumor samples). Tumor material was mainly fresh frozen (57%). Tumor samples were mainly obtained at the time of last relapse (55%) or previous relapses (12%). For sixteen (33%) patients with no available tumor sample at recurrence, the profiling was performed on the tumor sample at diagnosis. Genomic profiling results were reviewed following a target prioritization algorithm by a multidisciplinary tumor board with basic and translational researchers, molecular biologists, pathologists, geneticists and pediatric oncologists. Results: From December 2014 to February 2017, 49 patients from nine different hospitals were included. Main diagnosis was neuroblastoma (37%), followed by CNS tumors (22%). All patients, except three, had suffered at least one relapse/progression. In twenty patients (41%), at least one somatic pathogenic mutation was detected, and eleven patients (22%) had at least one actionable target alteration. In three patients (6%), we identified germline pathogenic mutations, two of them without family history of cancer. Conclusions: These results show that precision medicine applied to pediatric and adolescent tumors using NGS technology is feasible in our country. Commercial cancer panels could identify actionable target alterations in 20% of the patients. Target prioritization algorithm and interdisciplinary tumor board discussion is of foremost importance. P-384 SFCE Metro01 FourDrug Metronomic Regimen Phase M.A. HengMaillard1, A. Verschuur 1, Pharmacy, Marseille, France Background/Objectives: To investigate the antitumour activity of a 4drug metronomic therapy (MT) in relapsing/progressing pediatric extracranial solid tumours (EST). Primary objective was no progression after 2 cycles of therapy. Design/Methods: Patients of 4 to 25 years of age with progressing EST and adequate organ function. Treatment consisted of an 8week cycle of oral celecoxib BID, weekly vinblastine 3 mg/m2, oral cyclophosphamide 30 mg/m2/d qd for 3 weeks alternating with oral methotrexate 10 mg/m2 twice a week for 3 weeks, with a 2week rest. Maximum treatment was 2 years. Kepner Chang two steps model was used with 10 patients in first stage. If primary objective was reached in 2 or more patients, 8 additional patients were included according to 4 groups: Neuroblastoma (NBL), Softtissue sarcoma (STS), Bone sarcoma (BS), Miscellaneous IRB approval was obtained. Results: 47 patients were evaluable: 8 STS with 1 SD after 2 cycles: 1 patient with metastatic hemangioendothelioma stabilized and was treated during 24 months; 11 Misc with one patient stabilized for one year; 10 BS (8 osteosarcoma and 2 Ewing) all progressed; 18 NBL with 3 patient stabilized. Of the patients with SD, 1 stopped MT after 4 cycles being stable (physician's choice) and 2 patients remained stable for 1 year. 16 patients progressed before cycle 3. Median number of cycles was 2 (range 0.56). Grade 3/4 toxicity occured in 13 patients. Conclusions: This MT has no activity in BS and Misc and limited though interesting activity in NBL and STS with some patients being stable for > 1 year. (This study was supported by \"Enfants et Sant\u00e9\" Foundation and PHRCgrant). P-385 Ex Vivo Expanded MultiAntigen Specific Lymphocytes for the of Refractory/Relapsed Solid Tumors A. Houghtelin 1, C.R. Cruz1, H. 1Children's National Health System, Hematology/Oncology, Washington DC, USA Background/Objectives: Patients with solid tumors refractory to standard therapies have poor prognoses, and most salvage therapies are toxic and ineffective. T cell therapies, which have been successful in hematologic malignancies, offer a promising alternative for targeted therapy. We hypothesize that patientderived tumorassociated antigenspecific T cells (TAAT) targeting WT1, PRAME, and survivin expressed by many pediatric solid tumors can be safely administered to treat relapsed/refractory disease. The objective of this phase I clinical trial is to determine the safety of administering TAAT to patients with refractory/relapsed solid tumors. Secondary objectives include determination of disease response and immune reconstitution postinfusion. Design/Methods: T cells expanded from patient peripheral blood are stimulated weekly with antigen presenting cells expressing an overlapping peptide library spanning the tumor antigens WT1, PRAME, and survivin in the presence of cytokines. Following release testing (cytotoxicity assay, culture, flow cytometry), patients are infused with TAAT every 4 weeks on a dose escalation study ranging from a dose of 1 \u00d7 107/m2 (level 1) to a maximum dose of 4 \u00d7 107/m2 (level 3). Clinical and immune reconstitution studies are performed postinfusion to monitor for adverse effects and assess disease and immune responses. Results: We have generated TAAT products from 5 patients enrolled with relapsed/refractory solid tumors (neuroblastoma, osteosarcoma, Wilms tumor, Ewing sarcoma), all passing release criteria. We have safely infused 2 patients with no productrelated adverse events postinfusion. To date Patient 1 had partial response initially but later progressed; Patient 2 had progressive disease 6 weeks postinfusion and came off study. We are currently enrolling additional patients and characterizing the persistence and antitumor effects of TAAT in vivo. Conclusions: To date, the infusion of TAAT products has been shown to be safe. Response has been mixed thus far. We continue to evaluate, as outlined above, product and patient samples for functionality, specificity, and persistence. P-386 Omegachild An Early Clinical Study Aiming at a Novel Approach to Treat Neural Tumors and Prevent LongTerm Side Effects L. Ljungblad 1, Wickstr\u00f6m1, Women's and Children's Health, Stockholm, Sweden; 2Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Department of Food Science, Stockholm, Sweden Background/Objectives: The long chain polyunsaturated omega3 fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) have anticancer properties that have been implicated in cancer prevention. Additionally, tumor growth has been inhibited in vitro and in vivo and the effect of cytostatic drugs enhanced. DHA is abundant in the brain and has been implicated in neuroprotection. In addition, omega3 supplementation has positive effects on children with neurodevelopmental disorders. Altogether, these results suggest that omega3 exhibits beneficial properties both as an adjuvant in the treatment of childhood cancer and as a dietary supplement for prevention of relapses and reducing long term side effects in childhood cancer survivors. Design/Methods: This dose escalating, dosefinding study was designed to find the phase2 omega3 dose that increases the omega3 index to an optimum level >8% without sideeffects. Secondary objectives were to evaluate omega3 supplementation effects on platelet clotting ability, body weight and composition, immuneprofile, inflammatory parameters, lipid peroxidation, and perception/cognition/neuropsychiatric symptoms. We included forty children aged 218 (median 9.5) in remission after completed cancer treatment; eight in each doselevel: 400, 800, 1200, 2400 and 3000 mg/m2 omega3 fatty acids in 200 mL fruit juice daily for 90 days. Food frequency questionnaire was performed at start. Blood and urine sampling, body measurements and behavior questionnaires were performed before, during and after the study. Results: Thirtythree out of forty completed the study with compliance 83%100%, seven withdrew voluntarily. No severe adverse events were registered. Daily intake of omega3 enriched fruit juice significantly increased omega3 index >8% already at 800 mg/m2. Conclusions: Daily intake of omega3 increases omega3 index significantly without severe adverse events and is feasible with high compliance. The doseescalation strategy provides robust evidence to calculate appropriate dosages for future trials with the goal of promoting improved relapsefree survival with less longterm side effects.

HoffmannLa Roche Ltd, Pediatric Oncology, Basel, Switzerland Background/Objectives: Bevacizumab has an established safety profile in adults, but longterm data in children are limited. This analysis examined the effects of BEV on growth and development in pediatric and adolescent patients. Design/Methods: Data (height, weight, body mass index [BMI], bone age data) were pooled from five trials: NCT00643565 (Phase II, soft tissue sarcoma); NCT01390948 glioma, medulloblastoma, ependymoma). Patients were aged <18 years and received 1 dose of bevacizumab and chemotherapy (n=268) or chemotherapy alone (n=135). Analyses were exploratory and descriptive. Reference growth data were taken from WHO (<2 years) and Centres for Disease Control (2 years). Results: Across the trials, the mean number of bevacizumab administrations per patient ranged from 5.6 to 19.9 (dose 5-15mg/kg, every 2 or 3 weeks). Median followup time for bevacizumab plus chemotherapy was 37.9 months (range 2.4-64.2); for chemotherapy only, this was 22.9 months (range 2.8-69.2). At baseline, median height, weight, and BMI were close to that of the reference population (mean standard deviation scores [SDS] close to 0). Over 60 months, a slight decline was observed in the mean SDS for height and weight in both arms in this cohort of patients with different tumors and treatments, but remained within the normal range of healthy children. Trends were similar for BMI. No delay in growth velocity or bone age in bevacizumabtreated patients versus chemotherapy only was observed over a 3year followup, regardless of age or gender. A subgroup analysis of patients in the growth hormonedependent development phase was consistent with the overall results. Conclusions: In this analysis, bevacizumab inclusion in the treatment regimen did not have a negative impact on pediatric growth and development beyond that of chemotherapy alone.

The adult phase 1 trial demonstrated prolonged responses in patients (pts) with TRK fusions and a favorable tolerability profile. Design/Methods: This multicenter phase 1 study enrolled pts with refractory solid tumors aged 1 month - 21 years. Pts were dosed orally BID on a continuous 28day schedule either by capsule or solution. Pharmacokinetic (PK)directed intrasubject dose escalation was permitted, with exposures targeting the adult recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of 100mg BID. The primary objective was to define the MTD / RP2D; secondary objectives included PK and efficacy using RECIST v1.1. Results: As of December 31, 2016, 17 pts (12 with TRK fusions, 5 without TRK fusions) with a median age of 5.2 years (0.4 - 18.3) were enrolled to 3 dose levels. Pts were enrolled with fusions of all 3 NTRK genes in heterogeneous tumor diagnoses: infantile fibrosarcoma (IFS) (n=6), other sarcoma (n=4), and papillary thyroid cancer (n=2). Most common AEs regardless of attribution were vomiting, diarrhea, and fatigue. While 8 (47%) pts experienced grade 34 AEs, none were attributed to larotrectinib. No DLTs were observed and an MTD was not established. 12 pts (10 with TRK fusions, 2 without TRK fusions) remain on treatment with median followup of 2.8 months (0.7 - 8.4). Among TRK fusion pts, the vast majority have achieved confirmed RECIST responses regardless of tumor diagnoses. No responses were seen in pts without TRK fusions (n=4). 5 pts discontinued therapy, including 2 with TRK fusions: 1 pt with IFS had sufficient response to allow tumor resection, and 1 pt with IFS progressed with a documented acquired resistance mutation. Conclusions: Larotrectinib has demonstrated a favorable tolerability profile and histology independent efficacy in pediatric pts harboring TRK fusions. Updated safety and efficacy data will be presented. P-389 Drug Development and Market Challenge: Charity Stakeholder Perspective S. Richards 1, L. Knox1, N. Bird1, J. Rogers1, D. Ludwinski2 1Solving Research Advocacy, London, United Kingdom; 2Solving Kids' Cancer, Research Advocacy, New York, USA Background/Objectives: Drug development and marketing explicitly for paediatric cancers presents formidable challenges. A case study of dinutuximab, an antiGD2 antibody proven to be effective against highrisk neuroblastoma in a pivotal US trial, gained US Food and Drug Administration approval, but was rejected by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for reimbursement in the UK National Health Service (NHS) because of cost. Design/Methods: A charity based in the US and UK has proven to play a vital role challenging the NICE appraisal process, which is not suitable for evaluating the cost effectiveness of paediatric rare disease drugs. Relying on patient representative input, media engagement, parent community awareness, pro bono legal assistance, and emotive but expert arguments were submitted as a challenge to the NICE decision to reject the drug in the UK. Results: In the first appeal of a NICE decision by a charity, the challenge was successfully upheld despite lack of input or engagement from the pharmaceutical company. The drug company subsequently withdrew submission for NICE reappraisal when demand exceeded available drug supply, and drug will no longer be provided for marketing outside of North America in the foreseeable future. Conclusions: Charities have been proven to play a vital role in advocating for policies and regulatory issues affecting children with cancer. P-390 Indisulam Inhibits Carbonic Anhydrases Expression and Preto, Brazil Background/Objectives: The treatment of glioblastoma (GB) remains a major challenge since this tumor is highly resistant to radio and chemotherapy, and recurrence is extremely common. The poor prognosis of patients with GB is due to the intratumoral heterogeneity, invasive behavior, resistance to apoptosis and the hypoxic tumoral microenvironment. The hypoxic condition cells upregulates the expression of membranebound carbonic anhydrases (CAs) 9 and 12 that have been shown to act on acidification of the tumor microenvironment. In our previously study, it was found antitumor effects when CA9 and CA12 was downregulated in pediatric glioblastoma cell lines, hence the aim of this study was to validate and evaluate the effects of Indisulam (IS) on the CAs 9 and 12, and the apoptotic factors BAX and BCL2 expression in pediatric GB cell line. Design/Methods: The pediatric GB cell line SF188 was pretreated with Cobalt Chloride (50M) to mimic hypoxia for 24 hours. After, cells were treated with IS (IC50) and incubated for 48 hours. Gene and protein expression of CA9, CA12, BAX and BCL2 were assessed using qRTPCR and western blotting, respectively. Results: Indisulam significantly decreased gene expression of CA9 (P<0.05) and upregulated CA12 (P>0.05). A similar pattern to the CA9 and CA12 gene expression was observed in the protein expression. A downregulation in protein expression were also found in BAX (P<0.05) and BCL2 (P<0.001), with a greater reduction of BCL2 factor. Conclusions: This study suggest that IS may have an antitumoral effect, evidenced by inhibition of CA9 gene and protein expression and modulation of apoptotic factors. Thus, CAs could be particularly relevant to understand the mechanisms of glioma cell propagation and resistance to treatment and Indisulam may be an interesting candidate for the development of antitumor therapies based on the inhibition of tumorassociated carbonic anhydrase. P-391 Combination Therapy of Primary Tumor Resection and Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors for Metastases of Osteosarcoma: A Promising Therapeutic Strategy T. Shimizu 1, Y. Fuchimoto1, K. Fukuda2, H. Okita3, Y. Kitagawa2, T. Kuroda1 School of Medicine, Pediatric Surgery, Shinjukuku, Japan; 2Keio University School of Medicine, General and Gastrointestinal Surgery, Shinjukuku, Japan; 3Keio University School of Medicine, Pathology, Shinjukuku, Japan Background/Objectives: Immune checkpoint inhibitors have been used as innovative immunotherapies for cancer. Metastases are thought to be the most important prognostic factor in pediatric solid tumors. The efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors for lung metastases of osteosarcoma has been reported in several murine models. In this study, combination therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors and primary tumor resection was evaluated by using a murine model of spontaneous lung metastasis. Design/Methods: In C3H mice, 5 \u00d7 106 LM8 (osteosarcoma originating from C3H mouse) cells were transplanted subcutaneously (primary tumor lesion). Thereafter, the mice were divided into 4 groups as follows: the control group received no intervention (CG, n = 5); the primary tumor resection group, primary tumor resection 11 days after transplantation (PTRG, n = 10); the triple antibody therapy group, 200 g of three antibodies (antiTim3, antiPDL1, and antiOX86) intraperitoneally on posttransplantation days 11, 14, 18, and 21 (ATG, n = 10); and the combination therapy group, primary tumor resection on day 11 and 200 g of the three antibodies on days 11, 14, 18, and 21 (CMBG, n = 10). Survival curves were plotted by using the KaplanMeier method and compared with that plotted with the logrank test. Then, the lungs of the mice in the 4 groups were pathologically evaluated. Results: The CMBG showed significantly longer survival than the other three groups (p = 0.001-0.03). Six mice in the CMBG survived more than 10 weeks after tumor transplantation. Pathological study revealed multiple lung metastases 4 weeks after tumor transplantation in all the groups but no lung metastasis 16 weeks after tumor transplantation in the CMBG. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that the combination therapy of primary tumor resection and immune checkpoint inhibitors could be a curative treatment for metastasis of pediatric solid tumors. P-392 Indisulam Affects Pediatric and Adult Glioblastoma by Reducing Cell Proliferation and Migration, Promoting RadioSensitization and Prolonging Survival in Mouse Models S. Teixeira 1,2, M. Sebastian Viapiano2, A. Faria Preto Paulo, Department of Pediatrics, Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, Brazil; 2Brigham and Women's Hospital & Harvard Medical School, Neurosurgery, Boston, USA; 3Ribeir\u00e3o Preto Medical School University Genetics, Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, Brazil; 4Ribeir\u00e3o Preto Medical School University of S\u00e3o Surgery and Anatomy, Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, Brazil Background/Objectives: Carbonic anhydrases (CA), tumorassociated enzymes highly expressed under hypoxic conditions, have been considered as potential biomarkers of tumor cells and a promising target for specific therapies. In hypoxia, there are genetic alterations that lead to the expression of membranebound extracellular facing CA9 and CA12. In glioblastoma (GBM), the most aggressive form of brain cancer with a dismal prognosis in children and adults, CAs has been linked to aggressive and invasive behavior of cells and resistance to therapy. Indisulam (IS) is a potent sulfonamide inhibitor of CAs that has been used as an anticancer drug. Then, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of inhibition of the CA9 and CA12 by IS in vitro and in vivo models. Design/Methods: The pediatric (KNS42 and SF188) and adult (U87 and U251) GBM cells lines were cultured in hypoxia 1% and treated with IS (8256M). The effect of IS on cell proliferation, migration, clonogenic capacity, apoptosis and radiosensitizing was measured in vitro. The in vivo antitumor and chemosensitizing effects of IS were assessed in athymic nude mice (n=6) inoculated with the U87GFP. The mice were and treated (IP) with IS (25 or 50mg/kg). Tumor growth and potential treatment toxicity were monitored until survival endpoint. Results: IS significantly reduced cell proliferation (dosetimedependent), inhibited clonogenic capacity (P<0.05) and increased apoptosis (P<0.05) of pediatric and adult GBM cells. IS also reduces cell migration and potentiated the effect of radiotherapy (P<0.01) in vitro. The pediatric cell line KNS42 was the most sensible to IS treatment. Our results, in intracranial mouse xenograft models, indicated that IS crossed BBB and significantly increased animal survival (P=0.001). Conclusions: This study provides evidence of the therapeutic potential of IS as a radiochemosensitizing agent in drugresistant tumor cells and represent an attractive strategy to improve adjuvant therapy for GBM. Financial Support: FAPESP Study Atezolizumab in Pediatric and Young Adult Patients with Refractory/Relapsed Solid Tumors (ImatrixAtezolizumab) T. Trippett 1, G. Rossato2, Thakur10, Geoerger11 1Memorial Sloan Pediatric Developmental New 2F. HoffmannLa Roche Ltd, Pediatric Oncology, Basel, Switzerland; 3University of Texas Health Science Center, Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, San Antonio, USA; 4Insitut Curie, San Francisco, Adolescent Background/Objectives: Atezolizumab targets programmed deathligand I/II, multicenter, safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of atezolizumab in pediatric/young adult patients with refractory/relapsed solid tumors. Design/Methods: Patients aged <30 years with refractory/relapsed noncentral nervous system solid tumors received atezolizumab every 3 weeks until loss of clinical benefit (<18 years old, 15mg/kg [maximum dose 1200mg]; 18 years old, 1200mg). Safety/pharmacokinetics were assessed across tumor types, and initial response was assessed by tumortype cohorts after approximately ten patients in each cohort had been treated. Results: As of February 1, 2017, 85 patients (median age 14 years; n=9. Pharmacokinetic data (n=62) were similar to that reported in adults. Most tumors had score 0 (<1%) tumor cell (TC) or tumorinfiltrating immune cell (IC) PDL1 expression. TC and ICpositive expression rates (score 1-3) were seen in 7% and 10% of patients, respectively. HL had higher TC and IC PDL1 expression (5% [score 2-3]) compared with other tumors. 81/82 of the safety evaluable population who received atezolizumab (median cycles 2.5; range 1-16) had 1 adverse event (AE); 21 patients (26%) had treatmentrelated grade 3-4 AEs. Two patients had AEs that led to study drug discontinuation. Common AEs were pyrexia (45%), constipation (34%), and fatigue (33%). 2/9 patients with HL and one patient with a rhabdoid tumor (RT) had a partial response. Conclusions: The pharmacokinetic/safety profile of atezolizumab in pediatric/young adult patients is similar to that in adults. Preliminary antitumor activity was seen in HL and RT. Atypical teratoid RT and RT cohorts have been opened to explore this signal. P-394 SupraRegional Study Sites to Improve the Pediatric Oncologic Patient Care and Recruitment into EarlyPhase Clinical Trials: A German Model K. Waack 1, B. Wulff2, K. Roellecke1, D. Schneider3, T. D. Reinhardt2 1Center for Research Acceleration in Pediatrics, AMLBFM Trial Center, Essen, Germany; 2University Hospital of Essen, Pediatric Oncology and Hematology Pediatrics III, Essen, Germany; 3Municipal Medical Center, Division of Hematology Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Aachen, Germany; 9University of Bonn Medical Center, Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Center for Pediatrics, Bonn, Germany; 10Asklepios Hospital, Department of Pediatrics Division of Haematology and Oncology, St. Augustin, Germany; 11Municipal Clinics of Cologne, Department of Pediatrics Division of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Cologne, Germany; 12University 13University of Cologne, Hematology and Oncology, Cologne, Germany Background/Objectives: Earlyphase clinical trials could be a potential therapeutic possibility to patients without any other treatment options in regular patient care. Trial recruitment is hampered by the unevenly geographic distribution of only three to five study sites for whole Germany, that limited the recruitment radius just to a few kilometers otherwise patients must be willing to travel to the center for each visit or must be transferred to trial centers even in a preterminal situation. A defined supraregional virtual study site could solve this challenging situation and simultaneously meet patients\u00b4 and stakeholders' requirements. Design/Methods: Therefore, pediatric oncology centers (n=12) committed to form a network covering one geographic area (NorthrhineWestphalia). It is organized by one supraregional study site/central working study office (University of Essen) that acts as a coordinating site for merging the associated sites. A periodically updated (every 6 to 12 months) resource data and training plan for equipment and staff will be analyzed and strengths and weaknesses can be balanced between all participating centers. Whatever cannot be done decentral the coordinating study office will cover the task centrally. All activities will be performed according to Good Clinical Practice. The structure and its activities are supervised by a scientific leading group. Results: Patients can enter earlyphase clinical trials near the patient's home. It improves the patient access and compliance to experimental treatment options as well as the recruitmentrate earlyphase clinical trials. The supraregional site acts as one single site to sponsors, ethic committees (EC) and competent authorities (CA). In spring 2017, one industrysponsored and one academic study apply that model to EC and CA. Conclusions: The supraregional study site presents an attractive structure model addressing the specific requirements in recruiting pediatric oncology patients to early clinical trials in unevenly populated area states like Germany. Treatment and Care Supportive Care P-395 CancerRelated Fatigue in Egyptian Children E.R. M. Almalky3, Background/Objectives: CancerRelated Fatigue (CRF) is one of the most frequent and stressful symptoms in children with cancer that has a profound effect on Quality of Life (QOL). Aim: The purpose of this study is to find out the prevalence and patterns of (CRF) in children during cancer treatment Design/Methods: A prospective longitudinal descriptive study was conducted on 60 children with cancer, aged 5-15 years, who were receiving inpatient chemotherapy in the pediatric oncology department of Zagazig University. The \"PedQL Multidimensional Fatigue scale\" and a sociodemographic data form were given to the patients and their parents as well as 60 healthy control children. Participants were enrolled in this study just before the start of a new round of chemotherapy (CTX) and then following them for 10 days and before the next cycle. Hemoglobin level and blood indices were recorded with each fatigue measures. Results: There is a statistically significant increase in fatigue scores and all domains during treatment. There is the tendency of overestimating the fatigue by the parents for sleep and cognitive domains. A peak in fatigue occurs on the day 6 after starting CTX and then become better towards the beginning of the next cycle. No significant variation in total fatigue score and all its domains according to the gender and age at presentation, However, exist regarding the diagnosis; solid tumors are associated with better fatigue scores than lymphoma and leukemia. Low hemoglobin level was associated with high fatigue score and all its domains. (p<0.05) Conclusions: Patients have more problems with fatigue in the first few days after the start of a cycle of CTX. An assessment of fatigue should be done for every patient undergoing CTX and repeated at different times to apply a timely and tailored intervention to prevent fatigue. P-396 Challenges in Managing Chemotherapy Induced Febrile Neutropenia in Paediatric Oncology in Developing Countries: The Lahore Pakistan Experience A. Ahmad 1 1The Children's Hospital and the Institute of Child Health Lahore, Paediatric Haematology/Oncology, Lahore, Pakistan Background/Objectives: The Oncology Children's Hospital Lahore is a 60 bedded unit providing free treatment to over 1000 new childhood cancer cases each year.The aim of this prospective study was to analyze the burden of chemotherapy induced FN and to assess the leading risk factors. Design/Methods: Prospective review of 100 patients with FN admitted in July to August 2016 was done. Data regarding their clinical features, baseline CBC, course of therapy, hospital stay and understanding of caregivers regarding FN analyzed. Results: Total 100 patients with age ranging from< 1 to 15 years (67% <5 yrs) were included. 72% of cases had ALL and 28% with solid tumors. 28% had last chemotherapy received in 72 hours, 30% in last week and rest in more than a week time 36% had respiratory tract infections, 18% gastrointestinal infections, 20% mucositis, 10% no focus found and rest 16% had other manifestations Only 2 % presented in <one hour of start of symptoms, 27% <24 Hours, 61% in <5 Days and 63% had ANC <100.(pValue=0.003Hospital Stay). 29% presented with first episode while 51 % had 3 or more FN episodes.28% cases stayed 1 hour distance from CHL while 72% had to travel >15 hrs. 17% had no treatment before reached PTC. Only19% caregivers had adequate awareness regarding FN, 72% had some understanding while 9% had no knowledge about FN (pvalue=0.000). 40% had social issues, 41% were unaware while 13% showed negligence in seeking treatment (pValue=0.005) Conclusions: Health education of caregivers and health professionals is of utmost importance to prevent and manage FN effectively. Need of capacity building in pediatric oncology in low income countries is essential for provision of standard childhood cancer care. P-397 Yield of Surveillance Imaging for Invasive Fungal Infection: Solid Tumors VS. Hematologic Malignancies A. Al Sabha2, M. Mustafa Sultan1 Cancer Internal medicine, Tolido, USA; 3Cleveland Clinic, Internal Medicine, Cleveland, USA Background/Objectives: According to most recent guidelines for the management of febrile neutropenia in children with cancer, CT imaging to rule out fungal infection remains an essential tool that is commonly utilized despite risk of radiation exposure and uncertain yield in different disease categories. Design/Methods: After obtaining an Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, we used our departmental database, the Pediatric Oncology Network Database (POND) to identify patients who were registered between June 2010 and July 2013. We combined data from the POND registry and data collected by chart review in one excel database. Results: We identified 843 patients who were registered in POND over the 3year studied period. Median follow up was 9months(range, 0 to 37). Patients were diagnosed with leukemia(N=191, 23%), lymphoma(N=103,12%), solid tumors(N=371,44%), central others(N=35,4.2%). There were 3561 CT scans ordered in our center for 560 patients(out of 843 registered patients,66%). Median number of scans per patient were 5(range, 143). A total of 557 surveillance scans were ordered for 131 patients (median=4). Surveillance scans were ordered after a median of 6 days following the onset of neutropenia (range 047 days). The majority of surveillance scans were done for patients with leukemia/lymphoma(N=480) vs. solid/CNS tumors(N=77). The most commonly scanned sites were chest(N=272), sinus(N=211) and abdomen(N=44). Positive predictive value (PPV) for possible fungal infection was 26% for all scans. PPV per site were 25% for sinus scans, 21% for chest and 10% for abdomen. There was no difference in PPV of patients with leukemia/lymphoma vs. Solid/CNS tumors (P=0.62). Conclusions: Surveillance for fungal infections were commonly ordered for our patients according to our clinical practice guidelines with leukemia/lymphoma patients most commonly scanned. When patients with solid/CNS tumors were scanned, the chance of having fungal infection was similar to those with leukemia/lymphoma. P-398 Timely Administration of Antibiotics in Pediatric Hematology/Oncology Patients with Febrile Neutropenia: A Retrospective Study in a Tertiary Care Center T. Bauters 1, P. Schelstraete2, G. Laureys1, A. Mannaerts1, Dhooge1 1Ghent and Cell Transplantation, Ghent, Belgium; 2Ghent University Belgium Background/Objectives: Febrile neutropenia (FN) is a common complication in pediatric hematology/oncology (PHO). Current guidelines advocate timely administration of empirical broadspectrum antibiotics. Antibiotic delivery to patients with FN in < 60 min is an increasingly important quality measure associated with improved outcomes. The aim of this study was to measure the time to antibiotic administration (TAA) for inpatients and outpatients in our department, targeting a TAA of < 60 minutes. Design/Methods: A retrospective study was performed, in which TAA was defined as time between prescription and administration of antibiotics (inpatients) and time between admission to hospital and antibiotic administration (outpatients). Results: The study population involved 42 patients (59.5% males), mean age 6.7 years (range 2 months16 years), representing 61 FNepisodes from which 25/61 inpatient (41.0%) and 36/61 outpatient (59.0%) episodes. For inpatients, mean TAA was 82 minutes (range 0269); for outpatients 114 minutes (range 0420). A total of 44.3% FNepisodes (27/61) were within the targeted TAA of < 60 minutes, from which 13 (13/61; 21.3%) even within 30 minutes. In 18 FNepisodes (18/61; 29.5%) TAA was between 1 and 2 hours. TAA for outpatients with FN was more than 2 hours in 16/61 (26.2%) of episodes (range 121420 minutes). Conclusions: Results indicate a TAA of < 60 minutes for 44.3% of FNepisodes, which is a higher percentage than in literature data, indicating 1620% of FN episodes with TAA of < 60 minutes. The TAA for outpatients is higher than for inpatients. A possible explanation lies in time involvement of anamnesis, clinical examinations upon arrival in hospital and waiting time for laboratory results. This study confirms that all efforts are performed to keep the TAA, proposed as a qualityofcare indicator in our department, as low as possible both for inpatients and outpatients. P-399 Spectrum of Respiratory Viral Infections in Children with Cancers: Experience from a Tertiary Cancer Centre in Eastern India A. Bhattacharyya 1, A. Das1, G. Kolkata, India Background/Objectives: Pattern of respiratory viral infections (RVI) in children with cancers is not well characterized in India. We conducted this study to determine the spectrum, incidence of feverneutropenia, need for hospital admission, economic burden, and outcome (concomitant bacterial/fungal infections, need for ICU care, and death) of RVI in our pediatriconcology unit. Design/Methods: Data was prospectively collected over 19 months (July 2015February 2017). All children under treatment for cancer presenting with cough and coryza underwent multiplex PCR for respiratory viruses from nose and throat swab. Results: Positive results were obtained in 222/421 (52.73%) cases, of which data was incomplete in 8 cases. Final analysis was done on 214 cases. Fever was present in 81%. Median age was 5.35 years (range 0.517.8 years). Sixty percent were receiving intensive chemotherapy and 85% had a haematolymphoid malignancy. Commonest viruses isolated were Influenza A and B (46%), Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV 25%) and Human Metapneumovirus (14%). Peak months of incidence were July to September which is the rainy season. Fifty percent (106) patients needed admission, while 73/106 had ANC<500 during the episode. Concomitant bacterial/fungal infection was seen in 11.2% cases. Median duration of admission was 5 days (range 135 days), and median cost was USD 258 (range: 331939). Fifteen patients needed ICU admission of which 11 had concomitant bacterial/fungal infection (p=0.0001). Ventilation (invasive or noninvasive) was required in 8/15 patients of which 4 had RSV. Two deaths were recorded, both in patients with RSV and concomitant bacteremia. Conclusions: RVI adds significantly to the burden of admissions and expenses. Influenza vaccination given universally may prevent a significant number of such illnesses and admissions. Such a programme has been initiated at our center, and data is being prospectively collected to measure its impact. Concomitant bacterial/fungal infections add to morbidity/mortality.

Bomfim1, C. Cintra 1, S. Brandi1, E. Einstein, Pediatria, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil Background/Objectives: Our intensive care unit is a general unit with 15 beds and a media of 1000 admissions/year; it attends clinical and surgical patients whose reason of admission may be elective, urgency or emergency. OBJECTIVE: to know the profile, causes of admission and disclosures of pediatric oncohematologic patients in the pediatric intensive care (PICU) of a general hospital. Design/Methods: METHOD: retrospective analyze of oncohematologic patients admitted in the PICU in 2016. Results: RESULTS in 1073 admissions, 1.8% were oncohematologic patients. The were: elective (25%), urgency (65%) and (10%); 60% percent was female and 40% male; 25% was under 1 year old, 35% between 1 and 5 years, 10% between 5 and 10 years and 30% older than 10 years old. The rapid response team attended 20% of these patients, 80% were evaluated by the local staff and sent to the PICU. The origin was emergency room (20%), oncology and bone transplantation unit (35%), pediatric unit (15%) and surgery rooms (30%); and the causes for admissions were postoperatory care (25%), hemodynamic monitoring/sepsis (45%), respiratory failure (25%). Many of these patients were submitted to invasive procedures: 30% had a central venous catheter, 25% invasive arterial pressure, 20% enteral feeding, and 30% bladder catheter. None of the patients had complications as infection or pressure ulcer. Eighty percent was discharged for the origin unit, 15% to home and just one patient died. Conclusions: The oncohematologic pediatric patients admitted in the PICU require specialized intensive care and most of them were admitted in emergency and urgency situations. They are discharged back to the origin unit and then to home. Other information can be added to the already collected in the PICU, and a historical series allow this data to be accompanied and compared to other institutions. P-401 The Aetiology of Fever in Children with Cancer in the North of Scotland T. Lawes1, J. Calley 1, L. Adam1, N. Abdelrazig1, H. Aberdeen Department of Paediatric Oncology, Aberdeen, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: Outcomes in children with cancer continue to improve but febrile neutropenia (FN) remains a major cause of mortality. Mortality from FN episodes is 23% and 5 year mortality in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia due to infection is 2.4%. Rapid antibiotic delivery (< 60 minutes) is associated with improved outcomes. Guidance is available from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the Managed Service Network (MSN) for Children & Young People with Cancer in Scotland regarding empiric antibiotic prescribing. Our centre is currently unique in Scotland in practicing single agent first line empirical antibiotic therapy with piperacillin/tazobactam. Our aims were to assess the aetiology of febrile episodes in children with cancer in the North of Scotland and evaluate the adequacy of our empiric antibiotic policy in light of our local antibacterial resistance patterns. Design/Methods: Positive microbiological data for all paediatric oncology patients treated in the years 20132015 was provided by our local laboratory for analysis. Isolates and resistance patterns were compared with data from 20062012. Results: Microbiological isolates demonstrate secular trends of increased nonfermenting and environmental gram negatives and a reduction in Staph. aureus. There were nonsignificant increases in resistance to key antimicrobials in both gram positive and gram negative organisms. Between 20132015 there were 10 of an estimated total of 166 febrile episodes where initial dual therapy with piperacillin/tazobactam and gentamicin would have provided superior cover compared to piperacillin/tazobactam monotherapy. Conclusions: The number needed to treat to improve our coverage based on this data would be 17. This needs to be balanced against the known adverse effects of empirical aminoglycoside when deciding appropriate local antimicrobial policies. P-402 Can We Identify ChemotherapyRelated Toxicity in Children with Cancer Through Automatized Integration of Healthcare Information Systems? P. Berlanga1, M.J. Herrero2, T\u00f3rtola3, Fe, Pediatric Oncology Unit, Valencia, Spain; 2La Fe Hospital Research Institute, Pharmacogenetics Unit, Valencia, Spain; 3Hospital La Fe, Systems Department, Valencia, Spain; 4Hospital La Fe, Pediatric Oncology Unit, Valencia, Spain; 5Hospital La Fe, Planning Department, Valencia, Spain Background/Objectives: Integration of seamless healthcare data from multiple hospital data sources to identify chemotherapyrelated toxicity in pediatric patients. Design/Methods: Integration into a DASHBOARD, using Excel 2013 dynamic tables and Powerpivot, of all healthcare data from the following hospital sources: Farmis_Oncofarm\u00ae (chemotherapy), GestLab (clinical laboratory analysis), Delphin (blood bank), Philips ICCA(Intensive Care Unit), IRIS (HIS Hospital LaFe) y Orion Clinic (electronic medical record). Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) data integration process to acquire a data store (DATAMART) with the automatic integration of all prior information, as well as laboratory toxicity grading according to CTCAE 4.0 criteria and identification of chemotherapy delays/dose reductions and unplanned hospitalizations. Manual data extraction from patients' medical records (solid tumors) treated in our pediatric oncology unit and comparison of automatized data extraction reliability. Results: The fine tunning of the information tool was carried out following the next steps: A) Information tool design, B) Information tool testing 1 (manual data extraction of toxicity related to 65 chemotherapy courses and comparison), C) Information tool testing 2 (manual data extraction of toxicity related to 145 chemotherapy courses and comparison). Automatized data extraction was superior to manual data extraction with regards to identification of laboratory toxicity and chemotherapy dose reductions. A final test with more than 800 chemotherapy courses is currently ongoing. Conclusions: Automatized data extraction and integration of healthcare data from different hospital data sources is superior to manual data extraction. This information tool can simplify data extraction, allow early identification of chemotherapyrelated toxicities and improve quality of care.

Gonzalez1, H. Forrest1, M. Homsi1, J. Kirby1, M. Caniza 1 1St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Global Pediatric Medicine, Memphis, USA Background/Objectives: Bloodstream infections may result from translocation of gut microorganism into the bloodstream of immunocompromised patients. In January 2013, the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) released the mucosal barrier injury laboratoryconfirmed bloodstream infection (MBILCBI) to identify the subset of central lineassociated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) most likely associated with mucosal barrier injury. Infectious Diseases (ID) - Global Pediatric Medicine initiative mentored Infection Care and Prevention (ICP) teams in pediatric cancer centers (PCCs) in Latin America to separately track MBI and nonMBI events using the NHSN/MBILCBI protocol. Here, we describe MBILCBIs reported and determine impact of removing MBILCBIs from CLABSI rates. Design/Methods: Data were collected prospectively by our ICP teams in Honduras, Ecuador, M\u00e9xico, and Argentina. For this report, we reviewed the collected IDIO standardized HAI surveillance monthly report data between January 2014 and December 2016. CLABSI rates per 1000 centralline days were calculated with and without the inclusion of MBILCBIs to determine rate differences. Results: From four PCCs with an average device utilization ratio of 0.32 (range 0.120.94), 129 CLABSIs were reported; 41(32%) met the MBILCBI 1 criteria. The overall CLABSI rate was 6 (range 314) per 1000 CLdays. When removing MBILCBIs, the CLABSI rate decreased to 4 (range 210) per 1000 CLdays. In general, the percent change in the CLABSI rate was 32% (ranges 1643%). Among these PCCs, removing MBILCBI from the CLABSI rate determination produced the greatest CLABSI rate decrease (43%) in Mexico (3 vs. 2 per 1000 CLdays). The most common pathogens were (10%). Conclusions: Our results support separate monitoring and reporting of MBI and nonMBI-LCBIs in low to middleincome countries to allow accurate detection and tracking of preventable (nonMBI) bloodstream infections. P-404 Implementation of a Program Based on Adapted Physical Activity and Recommendations for Second Cancers Prevention for Adolescents and Young Adults with Cancer J. Carretier 1, A. Lion1, B. Fervers1, Young Adults with cancer Department, Lyon, France Background/Objectives: Around 700 adolescents and young adults (AYAs; 15 to 25 years) are diagnosed each year with cancer in the French AuvergneRh\u00f4neAlpes region. While long term survival is about 80%, they are six times more likely to develop a second primary cancer (SPC) compared to their peers. This risk is multifactorial and depends on the type of first cancer, the treatment received and the prevalence of risk factors (smoking, overweight, sedentary lifestyle, environmental exposures...). This project aims to implement a clinical program based on adapted physical activity and cancer prevention recommendations for AYAs with cancer. Design/Methods: Patients attended adapted physical activity sessions during the active treatment period (46 months). They were given questionnaires about physical activity (IPAQ) and quality of life (EORTC QLQC30) at baseline (T1) and at the end of treatment (T2). They participated to individual information meetings on SPC risk prevention (T3), and responded to a final QoL questionnaire by phone 1 year after T1 (T4). Results: age=18 [1525]) have been included and completed T1. On average, they participated in 4 sessions [212] at the hospital and 15 [442] at home. Currently, 41 AYAs (72%) have completed the T2 assessment. Preliminary results indicate an increase in the level of physical activity between T1 (680 METmin/week [03666]) and T2 (1377 METmin/week [02259]). on 51 h/week [1070] at T1 to T3, 36 AYAs (63%) were highly satisfied with the program. Conclusions: This study responds to AYAs' needs for support and information regarding physical activity and SPC prevention. To improve the quality of the program and its implementation, a gym room will be built at the hospital, and a therapeutic education program dedicated to AYAs will be developed. P-405 Neck Circumference: An Indicator for Assessment of Nutritional Status in Children and Adolescents with Malignant Neoplasms at the Time Brazil Background/Objectives: Malignant neoplasms in children and adolescents will trigger malnutrition, which may be underestimated in the diagnosis of the disease, when considering General Adiposity Indexes, such as the Body Mass Index (BMI). Anthropometric indicators may be able to detect early malnutrition, especially at the time of diagnosis of the disease. However, it is necessary that these indicators present good correlation with those that are consecrated to predict the muscular mass of the patient, such as the Arm Muscular Area (AMA). Neck circumference (NC) is a simple, low cost and easy to apply in clinical practice. The main objective of this study was to verify if there is a correlation between NC measurement and AMA of children and adolescents with malignant neoplasms in the diagnosis of the disease. Design/Methods: A crosssectional study that evaluated children and adolescents aged 0 to 20 years with malignant neoplasms at a Pediatric Oncology Specialized Institute from December 2015 to June 2016. Measurements of NC were evaluated and, for AMA calculation, arm circumference and skinfolds triceps were evaluated, all performed by trained evaluators, following standardized anthropometric techniques. The correlation between NC and AMA was performed through the Pearson correlation. Results: Among 40 new cases patients, 50% (20) were male. The median age was 12.03 (\u00b1 4.75) for the female sex and 13.43 (\u00b1 6.99) for the male sex.The correlation between NC and AMA was linear positive and very strong for both sexes, female (r=0.94) and male (r=0.93). Conclusions: It is concluded that there is a strong correlation between NC and AMA for boys and girls, and it can be a promising indicator in clinical practice, because of its practicality in the measurement, low cost, early detection of changes in the nutritional status of these individuals, allowing rapid Intervention and implementation of nutritional therapy. P-406 Calf Circumference: A Good Indicator of Muscle Mass Depletion in Children and Adolescents with Malignant Brazil Background/Objectives: Children and adolescents with malignant neoplasms may present early malnutrition, but this finding may be underestimated when only the Body Mass Index is considered due to the various metabolic changes, hydration status, and the side effects caused by the therapy antineoplastic. Anthropometric measures are able of early detection of malnutrition, specifically muscle mass depletion, such as calf circumference (CC). The main objective of this study is to verify if there is a correlation between the measurement CC and Arm Muscle Area (AMA), Triceps skinfold (TSF), and Body Mass Index (BMI). Design/Methods: A crosssectional study evaluated children and adolescents from 0 to 20 years of age with malignant neoplasms at a Pediatric Oncology Specialized Institute between October 2015 and June 2016. Measurements of CC were evaluated and, for AMA calculation, arm circumference (AC) and TSF were evaluated. The values of weight and length / height were obtained for the calculation of BMI. All measurements were performed by trained evaluators. Correlation between CC and other variables (AMA, BMI and TSF) was performed through the Pearson correlation. Results: Among 1232 patients, 43,59% (537) were female. The mean age for males was 10.0 (\u00b1 7.19) and for females, 9.84 (\u00b1 7.16). When analyzing the correlation between CC and the other independent variables, there were linear and positive correlations between CC and AMA TSF (r=0.64). Conclusions: It is concluded that there is a strong correlation between Calf Circumference and the independent variables analyzed (AMA, BMI and TSF). This result is greater between CC and AMA, strengthening CC, besides being an easy and low cost measure to be used in clinical practice, has a strong correlation with AMA, which also reflects muscle mass stores, being a good indicator for monitoring the nutritional status of children and adolescents with malignant neoplasms. P-407 Outcomes of Paediatric Oncology Admissions to the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit A Single Tertiary Centre Experience S. Dillon 1, J. Weitz1 1Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Paediatric Critical Care, Oxford, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: Paediatric cancer remains a leading cause of death in children, but continued advances in treatment and supportive care have helped to improve survival. Paediatric oncology patients make up a significant proportion of admissions to paediatric intensive care units (PICU). The aim of this study was to assess the outcomes of children with cancer that were admitted to PICU within a tertiary hospital. Design/Methods: A retrospective analysis of the PICU database system (Carevue, Phillips) in a tertiary paediatric hospital was performed. All patients aged between 0 to 18 years with an Oncological diagnosis, that were admitted between June 2014 and March 2017 were included. Results: A total of 111 patients were admitted to PICU on 139 occasions. Sixtyeight admissions (48.9%) had a diagnosis of CNS malignancy, 50 (35.9%) were haematological and 20 (14.4%) were solid tumour. The median length of stay was 2.2 days, with the longest stay being 40.9 days. Ninetyone of these admissions were for postoperative care and 47 for medical care. Fortythree of the admissions required ventilator support (26 postoperative and 17 medical patients). Three of the ventilated admissions also required inotropic support (2 postoperative and 1 medical patient). Two admissions required continuous venonegativenous haemofiltration (CVVH). One hundred and seven (96.4%) of the patients survived to discharge home. Three patients died on PICU (2 postoperative and 1 medical patient). One patient was discharged from PICU but did not survive to discharge from the hospital. Conclusions: A large proportion of oncology patients admitted to PICU requiring intervention survived to discharge to continue their treatment regimes. Several factors affected the duration of stay for these patients, including the reason for admission, underlying diagnosis, and the number of interventions required. Compared with data from previous studies our results suggest that PICU outcomes for oncology patients have greatly improved in terms of survival. P-408 Aromatherapy with Citrus Oils for ChemotherapyRelated Nausea and Vomiting W. Dirksen 1, M. Torbecke1 M\u00fcnster, Pediatric hematology and oncology, M\u00fcnster, Germany Background/Objectives: At the pediatric cancer center of University Children\u00b4s Hospital Muenster, 120 to 140 children and adolescents with newly diagnosed cancer are admitted per year and receive treatment with intensive chemotherapies. Nausea and vomiting are among the most frequent and at the same time most distressing side effects of chemotherapy. In support of antiemetic drug therapy, complementary nursing procedures can be applied. In this observational study, we evaluated the use of aromatherapy with citrus oils in our patient population. Design/Methods: Aromatherapy is based on the local application of 100% natural etheric oils on intact skin. The oils act against nausea via the olfactory system and by penetrating the skin surface. In the professional nursing care of patients with nausea and vomiting, especially citrus oils have shown efficacy. These include lemon, orange, tangerine, and grapefruit essential oils. Two to three drops of the etheric citrus oil are added to a clean cotton pad and locally applied at least twice daily on intact skin of the chest or close to the head. Results: Most patients with chemotherapyrelated nausea and vomiting report to benefit from the smell of citrus oils which overlay nausaenhancing smells. The symptoms are often mitigated and in some instances, occurrence of symptoms can be avoided. Conclusions: Aromatherapy with citrus oils can suppport drugbased antiemetic therapy. Individual preferences for smells, often shaped by personal memories and emotions, are highly relevant for therapeutic success and therefore should be considered for the choice of the smell. In combination with the medical standard of care, this and other complementary nursing procedures have an added value in the control of the agonizing side effects of chemotherapy and can thereby enhance the patients compliance with the subsequent therapy. P-409 Relationship Between State and Nutritional Risk Assessed by Instrument for Screening Children and Adolescents with Cancer K.N. DA SILVA Paulo, Brazil Background/Objectives: Malnutrition is highlighted as a common condition in cancer patients. Adequate nutritional conducts are taken from the effective nutritional evaluation, being necessary to the presence of a screening tool, which analyzes and evaluates the nutritional risks Murphy et al. (2015) proposed a specific screening tool for children on cancer treatment, the Screening Tool for Childhood Cancer (SCAN). To rate the relationship between state and nutritional risk verified through an instrument for screening children and teenagers with cancer. Design/Methods: A crosssectional, retrospective study with secondary data of 673 patients seen from August 2015 to August 2016.The results analyzed were based on the screening performed by the nutrition team in that period and compared with the concomitant anthropometric evaluations. Parametric analyzes were performed by the STATA v.10 program. Results: The degree of nutritional risk of cancer patients changes according to their location and cause of hospitalization It was identified in the study that the diagnosis of nutritional risk was related to the values of BMI (Body Mass Index) altered, being observed a significant relation between nutritional risk and body composition only in teenagers. Conclusions: It was found that SCAN may assist clinical practice in screening patients at nutritional risk, but further studies should be performed to confirm their effectiveness, especially with preschool and school children. P-410 Outcome of a ThreeWeek Supplementation Program in Children and Adolescents with Cancer and ITS Association with Acceptance in a Clinical Trial A. GAROFOLO 1, P.S. Brazil Background/Objectives: Malnutrition in cancer patients impairs prognosis, increases the costs of treatment and decreases quality of life. To study protocol compliance and nutritional outcome in malnourished patients with cancer after a 3week oral supplementation program and the association of that outcome with type of supplement and severity of malnutrition at admission. Design/Methods: This clinical trial included patients with 1 year old or above, followed during anticancer therapy. They were divided in two groups: mild and severe malnutrition. The severely malnourished received only the industrialized oral supplements (IOS) for three weeks, whereas the mildly malnourished were randomized to receive IOS or nonindustrialized oral supplementation (NIS) for three weeks. The supplement supplied 45% of the daily energy requirements. A new approach to intervention (NAI) was indicated in the severely malnourished group, if no adequate nutritional response was achieved and in the mildly malnourished under IOS if the subjects developed severe malnutrition. Results: One hundred and seventeen patients completed the follow up: 58 severely and 59, mildly malnourished. Adequate nutritional outcome was observed in 38% of those with a severe condition; therefore 62% had a NAI. The same analyses showed that 2.8% of the mild malnutrition IOS group and 22.7% of the NIS group required NAI (p<0.05). IOS and severity of malnutrition were significantly associated with nutritional outcome; IOS demonstrated better outcome and the severity of malnutrition worse outcome. Conclusions: These results suggest that IOS could minimize nutritional deficit, mainly in patients with mild malnutrition and the severity of malnutrition was associated with worse nutritional outcomes. P-411 Beyond Supportive Care: A Collaboration to Improve the Intensive Care Management of Critically ILL Pediatric Oncology Patients in ResourceLimited Settings E. Dray 1, R. Mack2, D. Soberanis3, C. RodriguezGalindo4, A. Agulnik5 1Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center, Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, West Lebanon, USA; 2Unidad Nacional de Oncologia Pediatrica, Intensive Care, Guatemala City, Guatemala; 3Unidad Nacional de Pediatrica, Nursing Education, Guatemala City, Guatemala; 4St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, St. Jude Global, Memphis, USA; 5St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, St. Jude Global/Intensive Care, Memphis, USA Background/Objectives: Hospitalized children with cancer are a highrisk population who frequently require critical care and intensive interventions. Survival for children with cancer in low and highresource settings is dependent on early recognition of cancer diagnoses, timely implementation of treatment protocols, management of side effects, and prevention of deterioration. In recent years, survival for pediatric oncology patients with critical illness in highresource centers has improved drastically. Resourcelimited hospitals, however, continue to be challenged by this population, resulting in poor inpatient outcomes and high mortality. Design/Methods: Since 1998, the Asociaci\u00f3n de HematoOncolog\u00eda Pedi\u00e1trica Centroamericana (AHOPCA) has demonstrated that multicenter collaboration can improve outcomes for children with cancer in low and middleincome countries. Using the AHOPCA infrastructure, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital sponsored a multidisciplinary conference on February 25th 2017 to identify challenges to the care of pediatric oncology patients with critical illness in resourcelimited settings and identify opportunities for multidisciplinary collaboration. Results: Over 47 nurses, oncologists, and intensivists attended the conference from all ten AHOPCA member countries. The sessions focused on quality improvement methods and the intensive care experience at each hospital to elucidate challenges and goals. The group identified several major challenges to the provision of critical care to pediatric oncology patients in resourcelimited settings: lack of adequate physical, personnel, and educational resources, inadequate institutional support, and provider resistance to allowing access to intensive care resources for these patients. The group identified over 27 multidisciplinary projects to address these challenges, fitting into the framework of topics addressing Quality Improvement, Research, Education, and Activism. Conclusions: This meeting represents the first multidisciplinary conference focused on the intensive care of pediatric oncology patients in Central America. This experience demonstrated that resourcelimited hospitals face similar challenges in caring for this population. The challenges identified can be addressed by innovative solutions formed as a result of multidisciplinary and multiinstitutional collaborations. P-412 Evaluation of a Nutritional Supplementation Program for Pediatric Oncology Patients with Malnutrition in Lilongwe, Malawi I. MteteKumwenda 1, ButiaMutai1, Foundation Malawi, Pediatrics, Lilongwe, Background/Objectives: Malnutrition is a critical comorbidity for pediatric oncology patients and increases risk for lifethreatening complications. Supportive care for patients with malnutrition is essential. However, we encountered challenges treating pediatric oncology patients according to nutritional rehabilitation unit (NRU) clinical guidelines in Lilongwe, Malawi, for two reasons: (1) World Health Organization malnutrition guidelines generally focus on patients under 5 years of age, and (2) protocols often struggle to identify cancer patients with bulky tumors because the tumor mass misleadingly contributes to the child's weight, thereby masking malnutrition, especially in older children, for whom weightindependent measurement of midupper arm circumference (MUAC) is not commonly applied. Design/Methods: A nutritional supplementation program was implemented at Kamuzu Central Hospital (KCH) in July 2016. All pediatric oncology patients received supplemental feeds with porridge, regardless of nutritional status. Patients with mild/moderate malnutrition received readytouse therapeutic food (RUTF) derived from peanuts, while patients with severe malnutrition received therapeutic milk initially, followed by RUTF. All patients underwent anthropometric measurements including weight, height, MUAC, body mass index (BMI) and were scheduled to have followup evaluations. We evaluated and describe the results of our intervention. Results: There were 25 patients; median age was 8 years (interquartile range 5.111.3). Diagnoses included solid tumor of abdomen (36%), lymphoma (24%), other solid tumors (24%), leukemia (16%). One patient died. Severe malnutrition was found in 48%, moderate 24%, mild 28%. Severity Reevaluation of weight at 1month/and 23 month intervals found: weight gain (36%/24% at 1 month/23 months respectively), no change (12%/16%), weight loss (24%/32%), and no data (28%/28%). Conclusions: Nutritional supplementation improved weight gain for some pediatric oncology patients with malnutrition. However more consistent and comprehensive reevaluation is required, in addition to investigating causes for failure to improve. P-413 National Exercise Counseling Practices of Pediatric Oncologists for Pediatric Cancer Patients L.L. Yelton 1, C.L. Gupta2, A. Stolfi3, A. ElSheikh4 1Boonshoft School of Medicine Wright State university, Medical Student 3rd year, Dayton, USA; 2Boonshoft School of Medicine Wright State university, Wright State University Student, Dayton, USA; 3Boonshoft School of Medicine Wright State University, Public Health/Statistician, Dayton, USA; 4Dayton Children's Hospital, Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Dayton, USA Background/Objectives: Currently, there are over 380,000 child cancer survivors in America. Studies show this population has reduced physical activity when compared to their peers, which has led to many comorbidities. The Children's Oncology Group (COG) LongTerm FollowUp Guidelines include exercise recommendations for pediatric cancer patients post treatment. The objective of this study was to determine 1) if pediatric oncologists are aware of these recommendations, 2) their exercise counseling practices, and 3) barriers to exercise counseling. Design/Methods: An online survey modified from Abramson et al. in \"Personal Exercise Habits and Counseling Practices of Primary Care Physicians: A National Survey\" was sent to attending physicians and fellows in the COG member list. Results: Twohundred ninetyfive attending physicians and 59 fellows returned completed surveys. Almost all (99%) believe exercise is important, but only 29% were familiar with COG post treatment exercise recommendations. Fiftyeight percent of attending physicians reported counseling at least half of their patients post treatment, compared to 20% of fellows (P<0.001, chisquare test). For patients on active treatment, 40% of attendings and 9% of fellows counseled at least half of their patients (P<0.001). Over 44% of fellows reported not having enough time for exercise counseling, compared to 22% of attendings (P<0.001). Of physicians who counsel patients on active treatment, 97% counsel verbally, and 76% recommend at least 3 days/week for 30 minutes. The more time physicians spent counseling seemed to improve patient compliance, especially when at least 35 minutes was spent. Conclusions: Although most physicians believe exercise is important for pediatric oncology patients, there is a gap in knowledge of current COG recommendations. Additionally, there are no published guidelines for exercise in this population. Further research should investigate methods to increase physicians' knowledge regarding exercise counseling for pediatric cancer patients and ways to improve counseling practices. P-414 Supporting Transport Needs of Cancer Patients to Reduce Treatment Abandonment L. Burns1, F. Pinho2, A.A. Khaing3, P. Freccero1 1World Child Cancer, Operations, London, United Kingdom; 2Please Take Me There, Operations, Cambridge, United Kingdom; 3Yangon Children's Hospital, Paediatric HaematologyOncology, Yangon, Myanmar Burma Background/Objectives: The cost of transport has been identified as one of the key reasons for patients to abandon treatment at Yangon Children's Hospital (YCH) in Myanmar. An assessment in 2013 found abandonment to be as high as 50%. NGO Please Take Me There is working in partnership with World Child Cancer to address this issue. A pilot project was developed to understand the transport needs of paediatric oncology patients at YCH. Design/Methods: A 2 week survey was conducted to understand barriers to accessing care. 107 interviews were conducted and criteria were established for offering transport support. A 4 week pilot project was then run using this criteria. During the pilot 125 patients were supported through 172 grants. A computer programme was designed to capture accurate data and the results were used to design a support package with the aim of reducing abandonment. Results: The average monthly household income of families at YCH is $78, while total treatmentrelated costs amount to >$2,200. In 40% of Burmese States, the return cost of travel to the hospital amounted to more than monthly household income. More than 70% of caregivers had to stop work regularly, or entirely, after diagnosis. 30 of the families had up to 5 followup appointments scheduled within the period of the project and the project team identified only one case of a family that did not return. Families became very close to the project team, contacting them frequently to provide updates on their travel arrangements. Caregivers felt more connected with the project team/social workers and often asked for support. Conclusions: The total of providing transport costs to all patients and families at YCH would be $88,000 per year. Providing the amount required for a round trip means that children will return for outpatient appointments and treatment, resulting in a lower rate of abandonment. P-415 The Feasibility of Physical Activity Interventions during the Intense Treatment Phase for Children and Adolescents with Cancer S. Grimshaw 1 1Royal Children's Hospital, Allied Health, Melbourne, Australia Background/Objectives: Physical activity may have benefits for children undergoing intense treatment for cancer, but such programmes are challenging to implement. This systematic review aimed to investigate the feasibly of physical activity interventions during intense cancer treatment for children and adolescents. Design/Methods: A systematic search of seven electronic databases (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, Public/Publisher MEDLINE, Psychological Information Database, Sportsdiscuss, Excerpta Medica Database, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database) from 2005 to August 2015 was completed. The risk of bias was assessed using the Downs and Black Checklist and The Critical Review Form- Qualitative Studies. Results were summarised descriptively across eight domains of feasibility: acceptability, demand, implementation, adaptation, practicality, integration, expansion and limited efficiency testing (including effectiveness). Results: Eleven quantitative studies and one qualitative study were identified for inclusion. Physical activity interventions were typically supervised, individualised programmes that prescribed a variety of activity types for hospital inpatients. There was evidence that physical activity interventions during the intense phase of cancer treatment were acceptable to parents and children, safe and successfully implemented. A trend of positive effects across all aspects of functioning was noted. Data were unavailable documenting feasibility for the domains of integration, adaptation and expansion. Conclusions: There is preliminary evidence that physical activity interventions are feasible, in that they are acceptable, safe and potentially beneficial for children with cancer but more work needs to be done to understand the most effective ways to implement these types of programmes. P-416 Investigating Vincristine Neurotoxicity in Paediatric Haematology/Oncology Messahel1 1Addenbrookes Hospital and Kingdom Background/Objectives: Vincristine is a vinca alkaloid which is used as chemotherapeutic agent for multiple paediatric haematological and solid tumours. This is frequently complicated by dosedependent neurological toxicity. Studies suggest that polymorphisms of the CYP3A and ABCB1 genes contribute to vincristinerelated neurotoxicity, which may explain variation in the prevalence of this side effect and overall prognosis. An established link between mercaptopurine toxicities and polymorphisms led to the incorporation of targeted genetic screening into therapy, suggesting a potential for tailored vincristine treatment. We aim to identify cases of vincristinerelated neurotoxicity within our patient population, characterise trends in these toxicities and investigate any demographic influence on these side effects. Design/Methods: This five year retrospective study from December 2008 to February 2014 focused on paediatric patients presenting to our oncology unit who were undergoing first line chemotherapy for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia, Low Grade Glioma and Wilms Tumour. These malignancies were chosen as they had a heavy burden of vincristine in their treatment protocols. Neurotoxicity was assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria of Adverse Events (CTCAE). Patient records were studied for details of neurotoxicity using this tool and any subsequent changes that were made to their dosage of vincristine. Results: Frequency: There were 66 \"neurotoxic events\". A high incidence of neurotoxic events of grade 13 severity was found with 71% of patients experiencing one or more events. Motor neurotoxicity was the modal group. Demographic: Toxicity was higher amongst females and the older age categories. There was an ethnic variation of trend toward increased toxicity. There was no clear relationship between tumour type and neurotoxicity. Timing: Two thirds of all neuropathies occurred within the first three months. Conclusions: This pilot study demonstrates a high rate of vincristinerelated neurotoxicity within a subset of the paediatric haematology and oncology population, warranting a larger study and potential pharmacogenetic analysis. P-417 Experience of Using Galactomannan Testing for Diagnosis of Invasive Aspergillosis in Immunocompromised Patients from a Tertiary Care Centre in North India R. H N 1, V. Dinand2, N. Radhakrishnan1, J. Oberoi3, A. Hospital, Department of Research, Delhi, India; 3Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, Department of Microbiology, Delhi, India Background/Objectives: Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is the most frequent and one of the most lethal invasive fungal infections in highrisk oncology patients. The diagnosis of IA is difficult and relies in part on the detection of galactomannan (GM). Aims and objectives: To study the utility of GM assay in diagnosing IA in paediatric oncology, paediatric critical care and stem cell recipients. A focus was placed on evaluating the assay sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value in paediatric patients. Design/Methods: Retrospective analysis of febrile neutropenia or prolonged febrile episodes in nonneutropenic immunocompromised patients between 1 July 2007 to 31 October 2016 was done. Standard EORTC criteria were used for defining fungal infections. Clinical profile, GM assay, radiological imaging and need for mould active antifungal therapy was assessed. Results: 507 patients with 825 episodes of suspected IA were enrolled in the study. This included 288 haematological malignancies, 78 stem cell transplant recipient and 58 nononcological patients from paediatric ICU. 9 proven and 25 probable were observed during this period. GM assay was considered as positive for values >1. The sensitivity, specificity and negative predictive value of the assay in diagnosing IA was 76.5%, 86.5% and 98.8% respectively. Conclusions: Data suggests that GM assay has a very good negative predictive value in diagnosing IA. GM EIA testing may be useful in diagnosing and/or excluding IA in atrisk paediatric patients, but the low incidence rate of probable or proven IA in this study precludes the ability to make any definitive conclusions. P-418 Correlation Between Galactomannan Antigen and Absolute Neutrophil Counts in Immunosuppressed Patients with Invasive Aspergillosis R. H N 1, N. radhakrishnan1, V. Dinand1, A. J. India; Ram Hospital, Department of microbiology, Delhi, India Background/Objectives: Galactomannan (GM) assay is being used widely as a diagnostic marker for invasive aspergillosis (IA) in immunocompromised patients. Most of the studies of GM have involved severely neutropenic patients, screened two or three times weekly during a neutropenic risk period. Time to positivity of Galactomannan depends on the neutrophil count and which is often ignored while interpreting the results. Aims and objectives: The aim of the study was to determine whether the diagnostic yield of GM was comparable in neutropenic and in nonneutropenic patients with and without microbiologically documented IA. Design/Methods: Retrospective observational analysis. The episodes of IA occurring in the haematology department were retrospectively classified according to the EORTC criteria as proven, probable or possible IA. From 1 July 2007 to 31 October 2016, patients data were analysed including the neutrophil count and galactomannan assays. Results: 507 patients were enrolled with 825 episodes of suspected IA. This included 288 patients of hematological malignancy and 78 stem cell transplant recipients. Thirty four episodes of proven (n=9) and probable (n=25) IA were observed. GM was considered positive if value >1 (n=131/824). 255 patients received antimould therapy for IA. When ANC was compared to positivity of Galactomannan in patients who received treatment for IA, a trend towards higher GM positivity in lower ANC was observed, although not statistically significant. (45.8% in ANC <50/mm3, 38.9% in 50100/mm3, 20% in 101200/mm3etc.) In patients who received mould active antifungals, median ANC in those with GM positive was 273/mm3 and those in GM negative was 330/mm3 (p=0.18). In those who were CT positive for IA, median ANC in those with GM positive was 309/mm3 and those in GM negative was 572/mm3(p=0.38). Conclusions: Galactomannan may be falsely negative in patients with ANC>500/mm3 and this should be kept in mind while interpreting the Results: P-419 Validation of a Classification System for TreatmentRelated Mortality in Children with Cancer H. Hassan 1,2, M. Rompola1,2, A. Glaser1,2, S. Kinsey1,2, B. Phillips2,3 Leeds, United Kingdom; 3University of York, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, York, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: Death not directly due to cancer has been termed \"treatmentrelated mortality\" (TRM). Appreciating the differences between TRM and diseaserelated death is critical in directing strategies to improve supportive care, interventions delivered or disease progression. However, it is poorly defined and reported in clinical trials. Recently, a global collaboration developed and validated a consensusbased classification tool and attribution system. This study aimed to evaluate the newly developed consensusbased definition of TRM and causeofdeath attribution system in a single institution, at a regional paediatric oncology centre in the North of England. Design/Methods: Thirty medical records of the most recent deaths in children with cancer, two and four weeks prior to death were anonymised and presented to the participants. Two senior physicians and two clinical research associates independently classified deaths as \"treatment related mortality\" or \"not treatment related\" according to the algorithm developed. When TRM occurred, reviewers applied the causeofdeath attribution system. Interrelater reliability was assessed using the Kappa statistic (k). Results: Reliability of the classification was deemed almost perfect between CRA and consultants (k=0.86, 95% confidence interval 0.720.97). Ten deaths were classified as TRM; of which infection was the most frequent cause identified. Reviewers disagreed on the primary cause of death (e.g. respiratory vs infection) when applying the causeofdeath attribution system in 6 cases. The study identified how the algorithm may not identify TRM deaths in patients receiving noncurative therapy. Conclusions: The classification and cause of death attribution system could be implemented in different health care settings. Adaptation of the classification tool in patients receiving noncurative interventions and the cause of death attribution system should be considered. P-420 The Efficacy and Safety of Probiotics in People with Cancer: An Updated Systematic Review and MetaAnalysis H. Hassan 1,2, M. Rompola1,2, Phillips2,3 Pathology, Leeds, United Kingdom; 2Leeds Teaching Hospital NHS Oncology, Leeds, United Kingdom; 3University of York, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, York, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: Probiotics are living microorganisms that confer a health benefit on the host when administered in adequate amounts. This study updates a systematic review and metaanalysis investigating the efficacy and safety of probiotics in adult and paediatric patients diagnosed with cancer. Design/Methods: An updated systematic review and metaanalysis was undertaken (PROSPERO registration: CRD42016050252). Randomised controlled trials (RCT), identified through screening multiple databases were included for analyses of efficacy. Nonrandomised controlledtrials and case reports were included for safety analysis. Outcomes included the reduction in the incidence and severity of diarrhoea, and adverse events. Where possible, data were combined for metaanalysis using a randomeffects model and subgroup analysis (including children) undertaken to investigate strains and dosage of probiotic, and patient characteristics. Results: Twenty one studies (N = 2,982 participants) were included for assessment of efficacy. Results show that probiotics may reduce the incidence of diarrhoea in patients with cancer [odds ratio (OR) = 0.52, 95% confidence interval 0530.77, 5 studies] and possibly the severity of diarrhoea for example Common Toxicity Criteria grade 3 and 4 diarrhoea [OR=0.51, 95% CI 0.122.2, Isq 92.5%, 4 studies]. However, more studies are required to assess the true effect. There were insufficient data to perform subgroup analysis on children, strains, and dosage due to marked heterogeneity. Twenty five studies (N = 2,242) were included in the safety analysis. Five case reports and a participant from 1 RCT showed probioticrelated bacteraemia/fungaemia/positive blood cultures. Conclusions: There remain insufficient studies to assess the true effect of probiotics in people with cancer. Evidence suggests probiotics may be beneficial but further study is still required, particularly in children. P-421 Predictive Value of Serum Angiopoietin 1/2, SFLT1 and VEGF Levels in the Diagnosis of Sepsis in Febrile Neutropenic Children I. Ilhan 1Dr. Ankara, Turkey; 2Dr. Abdurrahman Yurtaslan Ankara Ankara, Turkey Background/Objectives: Febrile neutropenia (FN) is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in patients with cancer. Endothelial damage and dysfunction is one of the important features of sepsis. This study sought to investigate the role of serum levels of Angiopoietin1 (Ang1), in predicting the risk of sepsis in febrile neutropenic children Design/Methods: From January 2014 to December 2016, we prospectively measured concentrations of ang1, ang2, VEGF and sFlt1 at onset and after 48 hour of fever in FN episodes, and evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of these mediators as predictors of sepsis and bacteriemia. Results: Eightysix 52 patients (F:23, M:29, median age:7.7 years (0.718)) were evaluated. The most common diagnosis were acute lymphoblastic leukemia and osteosarcoma FN complicated in 12 FN episode (%14) an microbiological agent was p<0.001) were lower in patient group compared to healthy individuals. Serum concentrations of Ang2 were significantly higher at onset of fever in patients with sepsis (med:145.82 pg/ml) than in patients without sepsis (med:75.13 pg/ml, MannWhitney test, P = 0.017). There were no statistically significant differences of Ang1, VEGF and sFlt1 levels in patients with noncomplicated FN compared to patients that developed sepsis and/or bacteriemia. Conclusions: We conclude that a high Ang2 level at onset of fever could be an indicative of sepsis in febrile neutropenic patients in pediatric cancer population. P-422 Caregiver Decision Making: A Comprehensive Approach to \"Care and V. Inglis Hislop1, D. Ludwinski2 1Solving Kids' Care and Connect, London, United Kingdom; 2Solving Kids' Cancer, Research Advocacy, New York, USA Background/Objectives: Families with children affected by paediatric cancer benefit from emotional support and information to empower decision making from diagnosis and throughout disease treatment. Informed decisions are augmented by recognition of emotional needs, social wellbeing, and knowledge of disease and clinical research landscape. Increasingly, more families are seeking access to clinical trials across borders when options become limited locally. A flexible multimodel approach termed \"Care and Connect\" for family support is a forwardthinking and unique paradigm developed to offer comprehensive support to children and their families. Design/Methods: The \"Care and Connect\" program employs a team led by a Family Coordinator to meet the needs of individual cancer patients and families. This crucial role provides a trusted and experienced parentprofessional who listens, identifies key needs, and provides tailored support and guidance throughout a cancer journey. The support provided in remit of access to novel therapies at home and abroad includes assessing and navigating the clinical trial landscape with the guidance of a researcher/clinician network, treatment cost negotiations, travel logistics, and annual parent education conferences to provide insight to current research. Results: To date more than 190 families worldwide have been positively impacted by this model, and case studies of three families presented demonstrate the necessity for flexibility and illustrate the range of resources required for supportive cancer care. This multimodel approach directly helped families in making informed decisions with regard to palliative care, access clinical trial overseas, and improve quality of life in survivorship. Conclusions: Families are empowered to make informed decisions regarding their child's cancer care when this multimodal approach of caring and connecting is applied. P-423 Hope for Cancer Kids Insurance Program for Childhood and Adolescent Cancer Treatment in Kenya I. Jaboma 1 1Kenya Hospices and Palliative Care Association KEHPCA, HOPE FOR CANCER KIDS, NAIROBI, Kenya Background/Objectives: Hope for Cancer Kids (H4CK) is a charitable organization in Kenya. One of the most successful programs H4CK has is Health Insurance program that covers all costs related to treating any childhood cancer in a Kenyan public hospital. Design/Methods: It has been made possible through National Hospital Insurance Fund(NHIF), a government State Corporation which has provided all Kenyans citizens who have attained the age of 18 years, with an opportunity to have access to an, affordable, sustainable and quality health insurance. H4CK has established a special partnership with the NHIF to ensure the registration of all children and adolescents suffering from cancer and their families at 5 USD monthly or 60 USD yearly for the whole family, as well as orphans at a subsidized rate of 5 USD monthly or 60 USD yearly per 5 orphans. It has provided a special reduced one month activation period for all parents registered under H4CK as opposed to the normal three month activation period for any other Kenyan. Results: As of February 28th 2017, 294 children have benefited from this program, 2 have completed treatment successfully, 270 are still going on with treatment and 22 have died. H4CK gets about 1520 new patients monthly in dire need of this support and most of the children affected in Kenya come from poor backgrounds. Cancer treatment is very costly; however it has ensured that all children suffering from Cancer can access treatment Conclusions: It has resulted in giving hope and motivation to many parents to take their children to the hospital for cancer treatment since they are relieved of the financial burden. As a result more children and adolescents suffering from cancer in Kenya have been able to access treatment. P-424 Clinical Severity of Dengue Fever Relates to Treatment Intensity in Children with Malignancy P. Jain 1, N. Radhakrishnan1, V. Dinand1, A. Sachdeva1 1Sir Hospital Delhi, Hematology Oncology, Delhi, India Background/Objectives: Clinical spectrum of dengue fever ranges from mild febrile illness to catastrophic haemorrhagic fever. Managing dengue fever in children with malignancy is often challenging. The clinical presentation, course and risk for mortality is discussed here. Design/Methods: We retrospectively analysed the data of children who developed dengue fever while on treatment for a malignancy (20092015). Dengue fever was diagnosed based on NS1antigen\u00b1IgM positivity. Results: We evaluated 21 patients (Male:female13:8; median range 8months17years). Underlying diagnoses included ALL(n=12), AML(n=2), postHSCT(n=2) and solid tumours(n=5). Nine were on intensive phase of treatment (4ALL, 1 day+17 post HSCT for relapsed ALL, 1relapsed AML, and 3solid tumours). Fever was the presenting complaint in 19/21 patients, followed by vomiting, abdominal distension, unexplained oliguria and unexpected fall in platelet counts. Median minimum platelet count was 6,000/mm3 (interquartile range 3,0009,000) with a mean time to platelet recovery of 7 days (range 313) in children on intensive treatment. Patients not on intensive treatment had significantly higher median minimum platelet count of 15,000/mm3 (IQR 13,00093,750; P=0.003) and shorter mean time to platelet recovery (3 days, P=0.013). Significant bleeding manifestations and severe illness with plasma leakage were found in 6/9 children on intensive treatment and 1/12 on nonintensive regimen (P=0.02). Two children died of dengue haemorrhagic fever during ALL induction and consolidation chemotherapy respectively, in 2010, probably due to a delay in diagnosing dengue fever. Investigations for dengue were sent on day 3 or 4 of fever during the 2010 epidemic while the same was done on day 1 of fever during the 2015 epidemic, contributing to early diagnosis and prompt management of dengue fever and no mortality in 2015. Conclusions: A high index of suspicion should be kept for dengue infection in immunocompromised children suffering from malignancy during the annual epidemics. Aggressive support is mandatory especially for those under intensive treatment phase. P-425 Oral Cryotherapy to Reduce the Incidence of Severe Oral Mucositis in Children Undergoing Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation: Results of a Randomized Clinical Trial T. Kamsv\u00e5g Magnusson 1, L. von Essen2, Arvidson1, 2Uppsala University, Departmend of Women's Health Clinical psychology in healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden; 3Uppsala University, Department of Medical Sciences Hematology, Uppsala, Academy, Department of Clinical Sciences Pediatrics, Gothenburg, Sweden; 5Karolinska Institute, Department of Dental Medicine, Stockholm, Sweden; 6Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital, Department of Clinical Sciences Section of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Lund, Sweden; 7Karolinska Institute, Department of Clinical Science Intervention and Technology, Stockholm, Sweden Background/Objectives: Oral mucositis (OM) is a common adverse effect in hematopoietic stem cell transplantations (HSCT). Oral cryotherapy (OC), cooling of the mouth during chemotherapy infusion, has been shown to reduce OM in adults but the effect in children has not been evaluated. The study aimed to examine if OC reduces the incidence of severe OM (WHO oral toxicity score 34) and use of opioids in children undergoing HSCT. Design/Methods: The study was a multicenter randomized clinical trial. Children 417 years old were randomized to either OC or standard treatment. The OCgroup was instructed to cool their mouth with ice as long as they could during chemotherapy infusions with an intended time of at least 30 minutes. Time was recorded by a nurse after each infusion and the child evaluated the treatment with a purposedesigned questionnaire. Grade of mucositis was recorded using the WHOscale from the day of transplant to engraftment. Use of opioids was collected from the child's medical chart. Opioid doses were converted to equivalent intravenous doses of morphine. Results: Fortynine children (mean age of 10.7 + 4.2 years) were included in the study. Twentysix children were randomized to OC and 23 to standard care. Compliance to OC varied considerably with only15 children being able to use OC according to protocol. Severe mucositis was reported in 20 children (41 %) with no difference between the two groups. Children used opioids for a mean of 8.7 + 7.2 days with a mean total dose of 184 + 262 mg IV morphine. There was no difference in the use of opioids between the two groups. Conclusions: OC did not reduce the incidence of severe OM or use of opioids in children undergoing HSCT. However, compliance to OC was poor, especially among the youngest children, which may have influenced the results. P-426 Establihsing the Dental Needs at Diagnosis in Pediatric Oncology Patients from Maritimes, Canada: Results of the EPOD Study J. Kearns 1, T. Doyle1, K. Kulkarni2 1IWK Health Centre, Halifax, Canada; Health Pediatric Hematology Oncology Department of Pediatrics, Halifax, Canada Background/Objectives: The recommendation for dental evaluation and treatment prior to commencement of oncology therapy is well recognized; however, data on dental needs at diagnosis of pediatric oncology patients is very scant. This population based study was designed to assess and report the oral health status and dental needs of pediatric oncology patients at the time of diagnosis, as well as the treatment provided. Design/Methods: After ethics approval, all pediatric oncology patients from the 3 Maritime Provinces managed at the Izaac Walton Killam (IWK) Health Centre from January 2013 to December 2015 were identified for inclusion in the study. Part of the routine oncology care plan for patients undergoing chemotherapy is a referral to dentistry for pretherapy evaluation. Data was extracted from (i) Pediatric oncology hospital database, (ii) Dental Clinic records, and (iii) Electronic medical records. The total number of patients with and without dental needs at time of diagnosis, treatment rendered, method of treatment, and caries risk status (CRS) were computed. SPSS version 24 was used for statistical analysis. Results: Of the 172 patients, 112 (65.11%) (male:female::1.4:1, median age: 75 months)were reviewed by Dentistry and included in the study. Among patients aged 05, 611 and 1219 years, 16.3%, 60.7% were: abscess (n=8), retained primary teeth (n=3), soft tissue pathology (n=2), and previous trauma (n=2). High CRS was observed in 56.3% (n=63) while excellent oral hygiene only in 1.8% (n=2). Treatment was required by 42.9% (n=48) of the patients and was coordinated with other procedures in 76%. Twenty eight patients required 1 or more extractions while 22 received sealants. Type of cancer was not associated with incidence of caries. Conclusions: A substantial burden of dental disease requiring therapy was identified in our study population. Care can be successfully delivered in a coordinated and multidisciplinary model. P-427 Hepatosplenic Fungal Infections in Children with Leukemia, Risk Factors and Outcome:A Multicentric Study H. Kzlocak1, Hospital, Pediatric Hematology Faculty, Pediatric HematologyOncology, Istanbul, Turkey; 10Kanuni Sultan S\u00fcleyman Research and Training Hospital, Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, stanbul, Turkey Background/Objectives: Children with leukemia are at increased risk for invasive fungal infections, including hepatosplenic fungal infections (HSFI). We aimed to assess the risk factors, treatment and outcome of HSFI in children with leukemia. Design/Methods: We retrospectively evaluated the risk factors, diagnostic approach, treatment and outcome of HSFI in children with leukemia in nine centers in Turkey. Results: HSFI were seen in 26 children with leukemia (15 female, 11 male); 21 ALL (15 precursor BALL, 3 TALL, 1 biphenotypic, 1 BALL, 1 relapsed), four AML (1 relapse) and one CML. All cases were diagnosed radiologically with abdominal ultrasound, that was performed at a median of 9 (121) days after febril neutropenia, some also had computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Twelve patients had hepatosplenic, five splenic and nine hepatic involvement. Most episodes occurred at the end of induction in ALL cases. Twentytwo patients had received steroids prior to HSFI. All cases were diagnosed during evaluation for persistent febrile neutropenia; three cases had abdominal pain, thirteen cases had back pain extending to the shoulder. In one patient the liver nodule was excised and mucor was diagnosed by pathology, in five trucut biopsy was done. All patients received broad spectrum antibiotics due to febril neutropenia radiologic/microbiology evidence of fungal infection in other sites (11 lungs, 2 lungskidney, 1 brain, 1 esophagus). Eight patients were transferred to ICU. Hemophagocytosis was observed in two patients. Two patients received granulocyte suspensions. Twenty patients recovered, six died (three due to HSFI, three due to progressive leukemia). Conclusions: We suggest that an abdominal ultrasound should be added to the standard recommendation of CT of lungs, for the evaluation of persistent febrile neutropenia; to diagnose hepatosplenic fungal infections. Mucor should be considered in the antifungal treatment spectrum. P-428 Folate and Vitamin B12 Deficiency in Children with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in LMIC'S: Better Nutrition or Supplementation S. Khera A. Background/Objectives: Vitamin B12 & Folic acid (FA) help in making the cell stroma conducive to the proliferation of the malignant clone. Lower middle income countries (LMIC's) are fraught with malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies. Refraining from folate supplementation to patients with malignancies in LMIC's has been questioned. We evaluated the incidence of vitamin B12/FA deficiency in children on therapy for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). Design/Methods: Children on therapy for ALL were randomly evaluated for serum B12 and folate levels. Serum B12 < 211pg/ml and Folate< 2 ng/ml were taken as deficient. Deficiency status was correlated to undernutrition.[Weight for age < 2zscore (WHO)]. Results: Hundred children, age 6.5 years (5.87.1), 50 each on maintenance and induction chemotherapy with 50 age/sex matched controls were evaluated. Induction Therapy: Eleven of 50 children (22%) were undernourished. Mean B12 levels were 331.3 pg/ml (269.3 to 393.2), with 15 (30%) being deficient, 2 being undernourished. Mean Folate levels were 9.06 ng/ml (7.67 to 10.44) with 1 child being deficient. Maintenance Therapy: Fourteen children (28%) were undernourished. Mean B12 levels were 500.56pg/ml (419.75 to 581.37). Deficiency: were 6.61ng/ml (5.567.66). Deficiency: 4 (8%), 3 being undernourished. The mean levels of Folate and B12 were lower in children who were undernourished during maintenance. There was no difference of B12 & Folate levels between gender and risk groups of ALL. The control group was not deficient. Conclusions: Childhood undernutrition in India is 45.9% with prevalence of B12 & FA deficiency in the general population being 733% and 2033%; with a higher prevalence in the undernourished. In our cohort 25% had undernutrition. We had 5% & 20% children with Folate & B12 deficiency. Patients with undernutrition had greater B12/FA deficiency. Undernutrition remains the monster to be tackled in LMIC's. Countering undernutrition and not supplementation is the key in LMIC's. P-429 Central Venous Catheter (CVC) Dysfuction Requiring One or More Doses of Tissue Plasminogen Activator is Associated with Significantly Increased Need of Subsequent CVC Placement J. MacLean1, T. MacDonald1, C. Digout1, K. Kulkarni 1 Health Pediatric Hematology Oncology Department of Pediatrics, Halifax, Canada Background/Objectives: Dysfunction (defined as inability to flush and/or draw blood) is common complications of central venous catheters (CVCs). Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is well demonstrated to reverse CVC dysfunction. However, the association between number of doses of tPA and requirement of CVCs is not clear. We hypothesized that requirement of an increasing number of doses of tPA are incrementally associated with requirement of CVCs in pediatric oncology patients. Design/Methods: Data was abstracted for all pediatric oncology patients from the 3 Maritime Provinces managed by the Izaac Walton Killam (IWK) Health Centre from January 2,000 to December 2,015 after institutional ethics approval. Patients who required 1 CVC were included. Data were combined from: (i) Pediatric oncology hospital database, (iii) Electronic medical records, (iv) Pharmacy database and (v) IWK central line database. Results: Of the study population (n=741) 26% (n=195) received 1 doses of tPA. Fiftyseven patients received 2 doses of tPA. The mean number of CVCs (2.05\u00b11.29 per individual patient, 55% of the patients needed >1 CVCs) required by patients who received 1 dose of tPA was significantly higher than the mean number of CVCs (1.52\u00b10.95 per individual patient, 32% needed more than 1 CVC) required by patients who did not receive tPA (p=0.0001). The mean number of CVCs (2.3\u00b11.5 per individual patient, 60% needed more than 1 CVC) required by patients who received 2 dose of tPA was significantly higher compared to the remainder (1.6\u00b11 per individual patient) (p=0.001). Conclusions: The present study demonstrates that patients requiring tPA for CVC dysfunction are at an incremental risk of requiring more CVCs based on the number of tPA doses. Our observations may indicate that requirement of tPA may identify patients at higher risk of CVC loss. After validation, this observation can aid in identification of high risk patients and designing strategies for mitigation of CVC loss. P-430 The Feasibility of an Integrated Experiential Training Program with Coaching by Healthcare Professionals in Hong Kong Chinese Children with Cancer: A Phase II Study K.W.K. Lam 1, H.C.W. Li1 1The Univeristy of Hong Kong, School of Nursing, hong kong, Hong Kong S.A.R. Background/Objectives: Literature review reflects children with cancer failing to attain the same physical activity levels that they had before contracting the disease. Scientific evidence supports that regular physical activity has beneficial effects, whereas physical inactivity induces a further increase in fatigue, muscle catabolism and atrophy. Nevertheless, increasing concern indicates the increased demand from families and children, posing specific challenges for implementing interventions during the unique intense treatment phase. This study aimed to examine the feasibility of an integrated experiential training program with coaching by healthcare professionals in promoting regular physical activity, reducing fatigue and enhancing quality of life among Hong Kong Chinese children with cancer. Design/Methods: A randomised controlled trial (RCT), twogroup pretest and posttest, within and between subjects design was conducted. A total of 15 children with cancer (9 to 18yearolds) was randomly allocated into the experimental group (N=8) and placebocontrol group (N=7). Each participant in the experimental group received home visits by a nursing student as a coach for 3 months. Those in the placebo control group received an amount of time and attention (home visits by research assistants) that mimics that received by the experimental group. The participants' levels of cancerrelated fatigue, physical activity selfefficacy, muscle strength, depression and quality of life were assessed at the time of recruitment and 3 months after. Semistructured interviews were also conducted. Results: No statistically significant result but positive trends were found among the outcome variables in the experimental group. Qualitative analysis also revealed that the informants were happy and satisfied to experience less fatigue, improvements in physical activity levels, selfefficacy, muscle strength and mood. The integrated program was found to be feasible with no serious adverse effect. Conclusions: An integrated experiential training program with coaching by healthcare professionals was found to be feasible and safe among children with cancer.

China Children's Cancer Group ALL2015 Study conducted a prospective multicenter clinical trial with chemotherapy stratified according to risk groups. This study aimed at analyzing incidence and prognosis of septicemia, and factors associated with IRM. Design/Methods: Regular reporting of adverse effects (AE) and serious adverse effects (SAE) are required, septicemia was predefined AE and death as SAE. Annual audit of participating sites included random checking of septicemia episodes. Results: From 01/2015 to 12/2016, 2,543 subjects from 20 participating hospitals were recruited. A total of 290 patients (11.4%) were reported septicemia, male to female ratio was 55:45, median age 4 years. Timing of septicemia was induction 183 cases (63%), consolidation 36 cases (12.4%), interim maintenance/reinduction 71 cases (24.5%). Twelve patients died and IRM rate was 4.1% (12/290), 2 patients died during induction, 2 during consolidation and 8 during interim maintenance/reinduction. According to blood cultures, 50.2% were gram positive (Gpositive) the 7 fatal cases, 5 were due to Gnegative and one due to Gpositive and one due to fungus). Interim maintenance/reinduction phase was associated with higher chance of IRM (P<0.05), there was no association with risk groups, gender and types of organisms. Conclusions: 11.4% of patients developed septicemia after chemotherapy, mortality rate was 4.1%. Early institution of broad spectrum during hospital stay at induction reduced IRM. Interim maintenance had higher IRM probably related to outpatient management with possible delay in starting antibiotics. Gnegative septicemia had higher IRM. Education of parents and early attention for medical treatment during interim maintenance should be strengthened. Supported by VIVA Children's Cancer Foundation (Hong Kong) P-432 Feasibility and Experience with Ovarian Tissue Cryopreservation for Females Undergoing Gonadotoxic Treatment B. Lockart 1, K. Coyne1, T. Lautz1, Chicago, USA; 3Northwestern University, Reproductive Medicine, Chicago, USA Background/Objectives: Many children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer now survive into adulthood. With these improved outcomes, research demonstrates families are concerned about the impact of treatment on future fertility. In response to the increasing awareness of familial distress surrounding infertility from treatment, Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital initiated a fertility preservation program in 2009. The program provides counseling, education, and fertility preservation to patients at risk for infertility due to cancer treatment or undergoing stem cell transplant for malignant and non malignant conditions. Here, we report our experience with ovarian tissue cryopreservation (OTC) in patients receiving gonadotoxic treatment, including chemotherapy, radiation, or stem cell transplant. Design/Methods: We reviewed our data on the number of fertility preservation consults provided to female patients since the start of the fertility preservation program in 2009. Information on OTC performed at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago from January 2010 to September 2017 is reported. Results: The number fertility preservation consults for female cancer patients increased annually from five in 2009 to 46 in 2016. Fortyfive females underwent OTC, with the number increasing from 3 in 2011 to 13 in 2016. The majority of patients underwent OTC prior to initiation of cancer treatment. Twentyfour patients were prepubertal (mean age 6.5 years, youngest patient five months of age) and 20 were postpubertal (mean age 15.2 years, oldest 22 years). No complications were noted after OTC. The number of tissue vials preserved range from four to 22. More tissue was preserved in postpubertal patients, than prepubertal. Conclusions: Ovarian tissue cryopreservation is feasible in both pre and postpubertal patients P-433 Feasibility and Early Experience with Testicular Tissue Cryopreservation for Boys Undergoing Gonadotoxic Treatment B. Lockart 1, R. Brannigan2, K. Coyne1, Pediaric Surgery, Chicago, USA 6University of Pittsburgh, Magee Women's Research Institute, Pittsburgh, USA Background/Objectives: Most children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer will survive into adulthood. With increased survival rates, research demonstrates that families are concerned about the impact of treatments on fertility. In response to increasing awareness of familial distress surrounding infertility from treatment, Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital (LCH) initiated a fertility preservation (FP) service in 2009. The program provides counseling, education, and FP to patients at risk for infertility due to cancer treatment or undergoing stem cell transplant for malignant and nonmalignant conditions. In August 2015 LCH opened a testicular tissue cryopreservation (TTC) protocol. We aim to describe our early experience with TTC. Design/Methods: We reviewed our data on patients who underwent TTC at LCH from August 2015 to March 2017. Results: To date, 15 males (14 prepubertal, 1 postpubertal) have undergone TTC at LCH. Mean age at TTC was 10.03 years (range 5 months to 18 years). Ten patients underwent TTC prior to initiation of cancer treatment. Testicular sperm extraction was attempted on two patients prior to TTC. Of the five patients who had received chemo, three were treated with 2.2 gr/m2 or less of cyclophosphamide prior to TTC. Two patients received nongonadotoxic chemotherapy. Data on tissue yield was available for nine prepubertal and two postpubertal patients. A mean of 11 vials of tissue per patient were obtained (range 426). Undifferentiated spermatogonia stem cells were noted in all tissue. The testicular biopsy was welltolerated. One patient developed an incisional infection. Conclusions: Testicular tissue cryopreservation is safe and feasible in pre and postpubertal males prior to and after initiation of chemotherapy. Viable undifferentiated spermatogonia stem cells were found in samples from all patients undergoing TTC at Lurie Children's Hospital. Funds for testicular tissue processing and freezing were from the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, University of Pittsburgh. P-434 Predictive Value of Procalcitonin and Interleukin6 for Bacterial Infection in Children with Cancer and Febrile Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Groningen, The Netherlands Background/Objectives: Only a third of children with cancer and febrile neutropenia have a bacterial infection, nevertheless standard care comprises hospitalization and intravenous antibiotics. Several biomarkers have been proposed as predictive markers for bacterial infection in this population. We aimed to evaluate the role of Interleukin6 (IL6) and Procalcitonin (PCT) in diagnosing bacterial infection in children with cancer and febrile neutropenia. Design/Methods: The study population was derived from a prospective database (20062013, IL8 study) comprising children with cancer who presented with febrile neutropenia. From stored plasma samples (taken at admission and/or at 1224 hours) we determined the PCT and IL6 levels. Consequently, we explored their relation with presence of bacterial infection (positive blood culture, positive xthorax or clinical bacterial focus). We predefined cutoff values, based on previous research, at 60 ng/L for IL6 and 0.25 ng/mL for PCT. Results: Seventyseven febrile neutropenic episodes in 55 children with cancer were included, in 18 episodes (23.4%) a bacterial infection was documented. Both at presentation and after 1224 hours, median values of IL6 as well as PCT were significantly higher in patients with a bacterial infection compared to patients without a bacterial infection. With both biomarkers above cutoff values, sensitivity was 93% (with either one this was 100%). The identified lowrisk group comprised 41% of the population. Conclusions: PCT and IL6 are promising markers in identifying bacterial infection in children with cancer and febrile neutropenia. In a subsequent project, we will incorporate these biomarkers in a risk assessment model that we will test prospectively in a clinical trial. P-435 Development of a Clinical Practice Guideline for Assessment, Prevention and Treatment of Pain in Children with Cancer: Phase 1 E.A.H. Loeffen 1, Hospital University Medical Center Groningen University of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Groningen, The Netherlands; 2Emma Children's Hospital Academic Medical Center, Department of Pediatric Oncology, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; 3The Hospital for Sick Children, Department of Pharmacy and Research Institute, Toronto, Canada; 4The Hospital for Sick Children, Department of Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, Toronto, Canada Background/Objectives: Highquality evidencebased guidelines for supportive care in children with cancer are needed. Pain in children with cancer has been identified as an area where many clinicians seek guidance. We aim to develop a clinical practice guideline (CPG) for pain in children with cancer with recommendations on 1) assessment of pain; 2) pharmacological prevention and treatment of a) tumorrelated pain, b) treatmentrelated pain, and c) procedurerelated pain; and 3) physical and psychological prevention and treatment of a) tumor and treatmentrelated pain, and b) procedurerelated pain. Design/Methods: The international and interprofessional guideline panel is comprised of a core group and six working groups and includes 44 individuals. In phase 1, clinical questions were formulated for each topic and prioritized (maximum 5 per working group) using GRADE methodology. The scope and possible outcomes for each clinical question were delineated. The critically important outcomes for decision making for each clinical question were then identified via electronic voting. Results: The six working groups prioritized a total of 25 clinical questions to be answered through systematic literature reviews. The number of critical outcomes differed per question, with a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 13. Conclusions: We have developed the framework for CPG development. In the next phase, systematic literature reviews will be undertaken and evidencetodecision frameworks will be used to formulate recommendations. We expect to finalize the guideline in the spring of 2018. P-436 Efficacy and Safety of Voriconazole Prophylaxis in Pedeatric Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia in Y. Madney1,2, O. arafah L. Shalaby1,2, Hospital Pediatric Oncology, Cairo, Egypt; 2National Cancer Institute, Pediatric Oncology, Cairo, Egypt Background/Objectives: Patients with hematologic malignancies are at higher risk for invasive fungal infections (IFI) and the incidence of IFI is highest among patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Early detection and appropriate antifungal prophylaxis can help to decrease incidence of these infections and its related complications. Design/Methods: A doublearms prospective and retrospective historical control arm study included 136 newly diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia patients treated at the National Cancer Institute, Cairo university from 2011 to 2013. Prospective group (75 Patients) received primary voriconazole prophylaxis (prophylactic arm) and compared to 60 patients retrospective control (non prophylactic arm) regarding the infectious complications and incidence of fungal infection. Results: Median age was 5 6 years. Almost all primary invasive fungal infections (IFI) occurred in lungs. Most of IFI occurred during induction phase of chemotherapy. Primary prophylaxis with voriconazole had highly statistically significant impact on reduction of incidence of invasive fungal infection between 2 groups (p value .001), 31 (50.8 %) of the 61 patients in non prophylactic arm and 5 (6.6 %) of the 75 patients enrolled in prophylactic arm developed invasive fungal infection. No statistically significant difference was detected between the 2 groups populations for age, gender, initial TLC, Initial monocytic count, risk stratification and previous hospitalization on incidence of invasive fungal infections. Fungal related mortality was reported in 8 patients /61 (13%) in non prophylactic arm compared to 2 patients/75 (2.6 %) in prophylactic arm. With median duration of follow up of 10 months, the overall survival and event free survival for the whole Group of patients at 3 years were 37.5% and 34.5% respectively. Voriconazole had an accepted toxicity profile. Conclusions: Anti fungal voriconazole prophyalaxis significantly reduce the incidence of fungal infections and fungal related mortality in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia patients However, its effect on overall survival is not as pronounced. P-437 Impact of Antibacterial Levofloxacin Prophylaxis on Clinical Outcome and Blood Stream Infections during Treatment of Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia Y. Madney 1,2, O. Hospital 57357 Radiology, Cairo, Egypt; 5NCI, Clinical Microbiology, CAIRO, Egypt Background/Objectives: Infections are important causes of morbidity and mortality in children undergoing antineoplastic chemotherapy especially Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) patients. The overall cumulative risk for bacteremia and invasive fungal infection (IFI ) increases during induction chemotherapy. Fluoroquinolones (FQLs) significantly reduced infectionrelated mortality, fever, and clinically and microbiologically documented infections. However, the positive effect of antibiotic prophylaxis is associated with an increased risk of harboring FQLsresistant bacilli after treatment. Design/Methods: This is a comparative retrospective and prospective study that included 136 newly diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia patients treated at the National Cancer Institute, Cairo University from 2011 to 2013. The prospective group (Group B) received primary Voriconazole and Levofloxacin prophylaxis and compared to the retrospective control(non prophylactic arm ) regarding the microbiological outcome and the correlation of bacteremia with IFI. Results: No statistically significant differences between both groups regarding rate of gram positive bacteremia (57.9 % in Group B, 58.6 % in group A, P value = 0.921) and gram negative bacteremia (38.9 % in Group B, 41.4 % in group A, P value = 0.7). Higher incidence of bacterial sepsis (50% in group B, 36 % in group A, P value .08) and bacterial sepsis released mortality (61% in group B, 36 % in group A, P value .07) seen in levofloxacin prophylaxis arm group. Conclusions: Levofloxacin prophylaxis was associated with increased bacterial sepsis episodes and bacterial sepsis mortality in our pediatric acute myeloid leukemia patients. P-438 CT Somatom Force: A New FirstLine to Investigate Diagnose Chest Infections in Paediatric Oncology Patients M. Raju 1, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom; 2Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals, Northern Medical Physics & Clinical Engineering, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom; 3Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Wolfson Childhood Cancer Research Centre, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: The sensitivity and specificity of computertomography (CT) imaging, as a diagnostic tool for investigating chest infections, is superior to plain chest xrays (CXR). However, greater radiation exposure, need for sedation and additional practicalities precludes the use of CT as a firstline investigation. We investigated the clinical utility of, and radiation exposure resulting from, the new Siemens Somatom Force scanner. Design/Methods: We undertook a retrospective casereview of patients with primary/relapsed acute leukaemia diagnosed after August 2012 (n=155), including 98 patients (63%) enrolled on the UKALL 2011 trial. Clinical episodes of suspected chest infections were defined as a febrile patient, investigated with CXR and CT chest. Radiological reports were reviewed, and radiation effective doses for each patient were estimated using conversion coefficients from the dose area product for CXR, and dose length product for CT. Results: Fiftynine separate episodes of CXR followed by CT chest were identified in 42/155 (27%) patients (median time between CXR and CT chest; 2 days, range 115 days). Twentyone (36%) CT chests were performed on the Somatom Force scanner. CT imaging added clinically valuable information in 33/59 (56%) clinical episodes, and where data was available, subsequent treatment changes occurred in 17/41 patients (41.5%). Importantly, additional radiation delivered by the Somatom Force scanner following CXR was significantly less when compared to conventional CT (p<0.0001 ttest; 0.89mSv Conclusions: CT imaging provided treatment modifying information in >40% of acute leukaemia patients with suspected chest infections. The Somatom Force scanner enabled reduced investigation time, with significantly less radiation exposure compared to conventional CT. This versatile stateoftheart technology has clear potential as a firstline investigation for chest infections in a selected population of immunocompromised patients, where early diagnosis and appropriately directed treatment may shorten hospital stay and improve outcomes. P-439 A Study of Pediatric Cancer Patients Who Interacted with their School Through Information and Communication Technology (ICT) during Hospitalization: The Benefits of ICT Interaction T. Masako 1, S.I. Suenobu2 1Oita University of Nursing and Health Sciences, Pediatric Nursing, Oita, Japan; 2Oita University Faculty of Medicine, Pediatrics and Child Neurolgy, Yufu, Japan Background/Objectives: This study focused on pediatric cancer patients who used ICT during longterm inpatient care to communicate with their school and analyzed interviews with mothers to elucidate their experiences from hospital admission to reenrollment and the benefits of ICT interaction. Design/Methods: This study was conducted from Jan. 2012 to Oct. 2015. Participants were six mothers of children who underwent inpatient care for cancer and then reenrolled in their school. Three semistructured interviews lasting about 30 minutes each were held with each participant. The modified grounded theory approach was used for qualitative analysis. This study was approved by the research ethics committee of the hospital. Results: The analysis generated a total of 9 categories. The mothers talked about their [Confusion and difficulties at the time of hospital admission]. They were satisfied with the [Positive effects of the hospital school].For [Relations with the school], mothers consistently communicated with the school. Regarding [Effects of treatment], mothers described the stress of witnessing their child endure the consequences of chemotherapy. The [Benefits of interacting with the school] included interaction that instilled a daily routine that conformed to the school schedule. In [Assistance from nurses in preparation for reenrollment], mothers were satisfied with nurses' joint conferences. [Mothers' concerns in anticipation of discharge] included worries about readjustment to school. [Support from the school] was generous in the sense that ICT interaction had prepared the school for the child's return and friends were cooperative in helping the child cope with school life. [Difficulties and responsibilities of mothers after discharge] included the difficulty of explaining their child's illness to others. Conclusions: The children's interactions with the school through ICT during hospitalization were a source of reassurance in the reenrollment process. ICT interaction was beneficial for the school because it helped prepare for the child's return. P-440 Incidence of Central Line Associated Blood Stream Infections (CLABSI) in Peripherally Inserted Tunneled Central Venous Catheters (TCVL) Compared with Centrally Inserted TCVLS McCarthy 1, D.L. Spiers1, D.P. Moriarty1, V. Wallace1 Belfast Hospital for Children's Oncology & Haematology, Belfast, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: Central line associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) is a frequent cause of morbidity in paediatric haematologyoncology patients and is associated with significant healthcare costs. In our unit, single lumen tunneled central venous catheters (tCVC) are preferentially inserted into the brachial vein in the antecubital fossa. Traditionally placed central lines are utilised when an adequate vein cannot be found in the arm or when a multiple lumen line is required. Design/Methods: We aimed to (i) determine a baseline rate of CLABSI, (ii) to identify risk factors for infection and (iii) to examine the differences in rates of infection between insertion sites A retrospective review of all patients with a tCVC inserted between 1st January 2009 and 31st December 2015 was undertaken. Infections were defined as possible, probable or definite, as per CDC guidelines. Logistic regression analysis was used to establish risk factors and Chi2 tests to compare rates. Results: Out of 147 patients (mean age 6.5yrs; SD 4.5), 72 children had leukaemia and 75 solid tumours. Overall line infection rate was 0.65 per 1000 CVC days. Infection risk was higher in patients with haematological malignancy (OR 18.75; p<0.001) and with doublelumen lines (OR 9.58; p<0.005). Subgroup analysis of children with singlelumen lines and leukaemia showed a trend to lower rate of infection in arm lines (0.31 vs 1.03 per 1000 CVC days, p=0.06). No change in infection risk was seen with age, timing of insertion or neutropenia at time of insertion Conclusions: We observed a low rate of CLABSI. Risk factors for infection in our cohort were haematological malignancy and doublelumen line. For singlelumen arm lines, there was a very low rate of infection. Difference in infection rates with tCVC site has not previously been described, therefore prospective monitoring is required to explore this observation further. P-441 The Use of Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment as a Preventive Supportive Care of PostLumbar Puncture Headache: A French Pediatric Oncology Center Experience C. Fort1, K. Michaux 1, I. (PDPH) is a frequent complication of lumbar puncture (LP) defined as postural headache occurring within 48 hours of the procedure and sometime accompanied by back pain, nausea, vomiting and dizziness. The leakage of cerebrospinal fluid through the dural defect produced by puncture is one of the etiologic hypothesis. Osteopathic Manipulative Treatments (OMT) on spinal column, in order to soften the dura mater before LP, could contribute to reduce symptoms.Our aim is to compare the incidence and severity of PDPH in children undergoing LP with or without preliminary OMT. Design/Methods: A prospective monocentric study included children undergoing LP for diagnosis or treatment from April to December 2016 in an oncologic unit. Every procedures were assigned with or without a preliminary OMT depending on the practitioners working day. Occurrence and duration of PDPH was assessed during 4 day by patient himself or family, using feedback form. Severity of symptoms was assessed by selfadministered visual analogical scales or heteroevaluation scales. Results: A total of 61 LP were studied (27 with OMT and 34 in the group control) on 45 children with a median age of 7 years [412.25]. No difference was founded in PDPH incidence (70.4 % versus 70.5 %;p= 0,98). PDPH seemed to be less severe and shorter (37% of patients had back pain > 2 days without OMT versus 17.6% with OMT, p=0.087); and 14.8% had headache > 2 without 8.8% with OMT ; p=0.46). Dural and cranial were founded in more than 80% of cases. Conclusions: These results did not demonstrate a significant benefit in using OMT in prevention of PDPH, but a tendency to reduce intensity and duration of post LP symptoms. Dysfunctions were frequently observed in this population and OMT deserve to be better investigated as nonpharmacologic supportive care in pediatric oncology. P-442 Practical Support for Children Living with Cancer and Their Families: Increasing Adherance and Survival Rates L. Moore 1 1CHOC Childhood Cancer Foundation SA, Gauteng South Region, Saxonwold, South Africa Background/Objectives: A cancer diagnosis can cause financial stress to families and result in children not accessing health services at a paediatric oncology unit thus decreasing their chances of survival. For 38 years, CHOC Childhood Cancer Foundation has been providing holistic care and support to children living with cancer and their families. Key to this is the successful implementation of a comprehensive practical support programme as a means of relieving the financial burden on a family, as well as increasing adherence to treatment cycles and increasing chances of survival. Design/Methods: Transport funds are issued daily to families from lowincome households. Alternatively accommodation is provided at CHOC houses for those who live very far. Both of these ensure that children can get to and from a treatment centre. Care bags containing toiletries, toys and a parent handbook are provided to families on admission to hospital. Information in the care bag guides parents through the treatment cycle and where to access relevant resources. On completion of a needs assessment families are provided with nutritional support in the form of a food parcel for when they return home. Results: Transport funds and accommodation play a significant role in ensuring adherence to and completion of treatment. Empowering families with knowledge helps them to better understand and cope with the arduous treatment cycle and therefore adhere to treatment. Food parcels ensure that children receive and maintain a healthy balanced diet during treatment. Anecdotal evidence and interviews with paediatric oncologists and CHOC beneficiaries from 5 different treatment centres in South Africa will be presented to show how practical support contributes towards increased adherence and chances of survival. Conclusions: Practical support, as part of a multidisciplinary approach to treatment, can reduce the financial burden placed on the family, increase adherence to treatment which can increase chances of survival for the child. P-443 The Quest for Certainty Regarding Early Discharge in Paediatric Low Risk Febrile Neutropenia: A MultiCentre Focus Group Discussion Study Involving Patients, Parents, and Healthcare Professionals J. Morgan 1, R. Phillips1, L. Stewart1, K. Atkin2 1University of York, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, York, United Kingdom; 2University of York, Department of Health Sciences, York, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: A recent systematic review found that outpatient care for children with low risk febrile neutropenia is safe, with low rates of treatment failure. A metaethnography of qualitative studies suggested that early discharge of these patients may not be acceptable to key stakeholders. The current study aimed to explore experiences and perceptions of patients, parents and healthcare professionals involved in paediatric febrile neutropenia care in the United Kingdom. Design/Methods: Thirtytwo participants were included in eight focus group discussions in three different centres, purposively selected from a large national survey for differences in their service structure and febrile neutropenia management. Analysis was iterative, using a constant comparative method, with triangulation across centres and participant groups. Results: Participants described a quest for certainty, where they attempted to balance the uncertainty involved in understanding, expressing and negotiating risk with the illusion of certainty provided by strict protocols. Participants assessed risk using both formal and informal stratification tools, overlaid with emotional reactions to risk and experiences of risk within other situations. The benefits of certainty provided by protocols resulted in frustration at their strict constraints. The perceived benefits and harms of inpatient care that participants had previously experienced informed their appraisals of future treatment strategies. This work demonstrated how statistics identified in systematic reviews are interpreted and used by key stakeholders to assess risk differently, and how families in particular can view the harms of therapeutic options as different from the outcomes utilised within the literature. Conclusions: This study highlighted the previously underestimated harms of admission for febrile neutropenia and the paternalistic nature of decision making, along with the frustrations and challenges for all parties involved in caring for these children. It justifies a reassessment of current treatment strategies for these children and exploration of the introduction of shared decision making. P-444 Etiology and Clinical Course of Pediatric Febrile Neutropenia in EL Salvador S. Mukkada 1, A. Alabi3, R. Hayden2, G. Maron1 1St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Infectious Diseases, Memphis, USA; 2St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Pathology, Memphis, USA; 3Hospital Nacional de Ninos Benjamin Bloom, Oncology, San Salvador, El Salvador; 4St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Global Pediatric Medicine, Memphis, USA Background/Objectives: Infection has been identified as one of the key drivers of morbidity and mortality in pediatric patients treated for cancer in low and middle income countries (LMIC). Identifying the causative organisms and clinical evolution of patients with febrile neutropenia has critical implications for empiric therapy in these settings however access to diagnostic testing, particularly for fungal and viral infections, is limited. Design/Methods: We prospectively ascertained the etiology and clinical outcomes of a group of pediatric cancer patients presenting with febrile neutropenia in El Salvador. Clinical, sociodemographic and laboratory predictors of adverse clinical outcomes were additionally collected. Results: We captured 240 febrile neutropenic episodes from November 2011 to June 2014. Patients were febrile prior to admission in 134 (56%) episodes; median delay to admission was 13.6 hours (IQR 727 hours). Fever was categorized as being of unknown origin in 125 (52%) of episodes, with suspected or proven bacterial etiology in 30% (n=72), in (n=34) of episodes. Microorganisms were recovered in 40 evaluable episodes, with bacteremia diagnosed in 22 episodes and a CVC associated bloodstream infection in 11 episodes. Escherichia coli was the organism most frequently isolated from blood culture (n=8), however, coagulase negative staphylococci were identified in 7 positive blood cultures. Mortality due to infection (n=1, 0.04%) and intensive care unit admission (n=12, 5%) were infrequent. Conclusions: In this LMIC setting, the etiology of febrile episodes is frequently unknown, however, morbidity and mortality are low, likely due to prompt empiric therapy. Increased access to diagnostic tests, particularly for viral and fungal organisms, may improve diagnostic precision, but their impact on clinical outcomes and resource use remains unknown. Further investigation, including cost effectiveness analyses, will be required to optimize management of febrile neutropenia in LMIC. P-445 Identifying the Adverse Effects of Oncological Treatment in Pediatric Patients on Parents/Caregivers Perception: An Important Tool to Direct the Therapeutic Plan in Nutrition J. Nabarrete 1, A.P. Noronha Paulo, Brazil Background/Objectives: There are many symptoms that may contribute to decreased food intake during treatment, but not all of them distress the family of the same intensity. Outpatient followup provides a greater moment to family participate in nutritional care. Identify which adverse effects are more impacting and which the better nutritional counseling in the management of them. Design/Methods: A prospective study was conducted in July 2015. Through a questionnaire applied to parents or caregivers when was investigated what symptoms impairs food intake of children and which nutritional counseling them prefer to be used to support the management of these symptoms. Results: A total of 19 questionnaires were answered, 68% were mothers, 16% were parents and 16% were other people. Among the most frequent diseases were 41% leukemia followed by 22.7% Lymphomas and 11% Nononcological diseases (e.g., Combined Immunodeficiency Syndrome). Decreased appetite was the symptom most cited (n=13), followed by nausea/vomiting (n=8), mucositis/pain at swallowing (n=7), and alteration of the gastrointestinal tract (n=1). Individual verbal guidance was the nutritional counseling more mentioned, followed by practical nutrition workshop, written guidance and nutrition speeches. In addition, other forms of nutritional counseling were cited which the exchange of experiences between patients and the practical nutrition workshops for children. Guide on the inappetence, feeding in the phases of life and during the treatment and the presentation of recipes and menus appropriate to the age groups were suggestions of themes for news approaches to nutritional counseling. Conclusions: Decreased appetite is the most disturbing symptom during treatment and the best way to approach the management of nutritional therapy is individualized verbal guidance. This work was guiding the management of the diet plan in the oncopediatrics outpatient clinic, contributing to personalized and humanized care in Nutrition, involving and empowering patient/caregivers in the treatment. P-446 Bacterial Infections in Children Treated for Cancer in South Africa G. Naidu 1, A. Izu2, R. Wainwright1, S. Poyiadjis1, Rowe1, 1University the Witwatersrand and Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital, Paediatrics, Johannesburg, South Africa; 2Medical Research Council, Meningeal and Respiratory Pathogens Research Unit, Johannesburg, South Africa; 3Medical Research Council Department of Science/ National Research Foundation: Vaccine Preventable Diseases Faculty of Health Science National Institute for Communicable Diseases a Division of National Health Laboratory Service Sandringham, Meningeal and Respiratory Pathogens Research Unit University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa Background/Objectives: Introduction: Bacteria commonly cause infections in children with cancer. This is related to chemotherapy, stage of disease, immune dysfunction, neutropenia, malnutrition, surgery, and radiotherapy. Aim: To prospectively delineate the bacterial epidemiology of infectious morbidity and mortality in children with cancer. Design/Methods: Methods: Febrile episodes in children treated for cancer were studied. A history, examination and a full blood count with differential and a blood culture was obtained. Results: Results 169 patients were enrolled, 82 (42.5%) with a haematological malignancy (HM) and 87 (51.5%) with a solid tumour (ST), 56.8% male, median age 68.5 months and 10.6% HIVinfected. 77.5% had at least one microbiologically (87.8% HM vs 67.8% ST; p< 0.001) and 528 suspected septic episodes (SSE), with a mean of 3.1/patient (4 HM vs 2.3 ST; p<0.001). The incidence vs p<0.001) for HM and ST. The incidence of MCSE in children with highrisk HM ((109) was 4.01 more than in mediumrisk HM (27; p<0.001). Children with metastatic ST had a higher incidence (71) of MSCE compared with localized ST (29; aOR: 2.49; p<0.001). Most children were severely malnourished (76.9% by MUAC and 56.8% by AMA). The most of the deaths were due to sepsis and all had a HM. Conclusions: Advanced disease (25% of ST and 61% of NHL had Stage 4 disease and 78% of children with ALL had highrisk disease) and intensive treatment was independently associated with sepsis. P-447 Evaluating the Effectiveness of Ketamine Plus Atropine as Anaesthesia for Intrathecal Chemotherapy and Bone Marrow Aspiration at Hospital, Vietnam H. Nguyen Thi Kim 1, H. Chau Van1, W. Kazuyo2 1Hue Central Hospital, Hue Pediatric Center, Hue, Vietnam; 2Asian Children Care's League Japan, CEO, Tokyo, Japan Background/Objectives: Ketamine and atropine have increasingly been used in recent years as an effective form of deep sedation/anaesthesia in children in developed countries, but not in developing countries like Vietnam. This pioneer trial aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of using ketamine plus atropine as anaesthetic agents for paediatric oncology procedures. From this study, we establish a protocol for anaesthesia in paediatric oncology procedures. Design/Methods: A descriptive and prospective study on 103 paediatric patients of both sexes (64 males and 39 females) aged 7 months to 14 years (median age: 4.0 \u00b1 3.3 years) and with body weight between 4.5 to 40 kg was carried out from January 2015 to March 2017. The patients had been diagnosed with either acute lymphoblastic leukaemia or acute myeloid leukaemia. They underwent intrathecal chemotherapy and bone marrow aspirations for diagnostic as well as therapeutic purposes. Results: The total number of procedures was 381. Bone marrow aspiration was performed 163 times and intrathecal chemotherapy given 218 times. 99.7% procedures were successfully. The dose of ketamine and atropine used 1.83 \u00b1 0.25 mg/kg and 0.100 \u00b1 0.013 mg respectively. The time taken for anaesthesia to wear off was short: 8.5 \u00b1 % vomiting; none of the patients had laryngospasm or transient rash. Most of the patients' parents were satisfied with the use of anaesthetics. Conclusions: This is a pioneer trial for children in Vietnam. 2 mg/kg intravenous ketamine and 0.1 mg atropine were found to be effective and suitable dose in children requiring deep sedation for painful procedures and produce only minimal side effects. We established a protocol with the above doses and continue to apply this in order to reduce pain, trauma, and complications and to practice safely. P-448 Feasibility of Testing Physical Function in Children with Cancer during Intense Treatment in the Respect Study and Challenges in Clinical Practice M.K.F. Nielsen 1, J.F. Christensen2, Adolescent Medicine, Copenhagen, Denmark; 2Copenhagen University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Centre of Inflammation and Metabolism / Centre for Physical Activity Research CIM/CFAS, Copenhagen, Denmark; 3Institute of Clinical Medicine Faculty of Medicine, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark; 4Norwegian School of Sport Sciences, Department of Sports Medicine, Oslo, Norway; 5Campus Sogndal, Western Norway University of Applied Sciences, R\u00f8yrgata, Norway Background/Objectives: Children with cancer exhibit reduced physical function during and following treatment. The \"Rehabilitation including Social and Physical activity and Education in Children and Teenagers with Cancer\" (RESPECT) study examines multimodal rehabilitation intervention initiated from diagnosis including physical activity intervention. Here we discuss feasibility and barriers of physical function evaluation. Design/Methods: Seventyfive children (aged 618 years [mean age: 11.3 \u00b13.1 y]), 61.3% boys diagnosed with cancer from the intervention group were included. At diagnosis and after three months, participants were scheduled to perform a testbattery including timed up and go (TUG), sittostand (STS), flamingo balance, handgrip strength, and cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) on a bicycle ergometer. Results: During the first 3 months 69 (92%) Of 75 children completed at least one test. Adherence rates were 66.7% for TUG, 71.3% for STS, 77.3% for balance and 80.7% for handgrip strength. CPET was associated with several barriers, and overall 25.3% of the tests were completed. Failure to complete CPETs was mainly (80.4%) due to medical restrictions (e.g. physician restrictions or side effects) with motivational and logistic reasons accounting for only 8 and 11.6%, respectively. In 607 completed tests one serious adverse event was observed, with one child who fainted briefly after CPET. Preliminary results show no change in VO2peak (mL/kg/min), and max watt (p>0.1). STS and balance trended to be impaired (P=0.07 and P=0.06 respectively) and a significant decrease in handgrip strength (p=0.03) and TUG (p=0.046) were observed. Conclusions: Evaluation of physical function in childhood cancer is safe and generally feasible and the children are motivated to participate. However strenuous tests such as CPET are accompanied by several barriers such as physician restrictions, side effects and logistic challenges. The preliminary results suggest that physical activity may prevent a further impairment of CPET during early treatment. Despite the intervention, strength and TUG declined. P-449 Outcomes of Events to Support Pediatric Cancer Patients' Siblings Through Collaboration with a Pediatric Hospital and Nursing University J. Nonaka 1, S. Oka1, M. Yonayama1, M. Yamazaki1, K. Wada2 1Kanagawa University of Human Services Faculty of Health & Social Work School of, Nursing, Yokosuka, Japan; 2Nursing Care Children Fukushima Medical University School of Nursing, Nursing, Fukushima, Japan Background/Objectives: This study examined the outcomes of sibling support events we held through collaboration with a hospital specializing in pediatrics and a nursing university.To examine the contents and outcomes of the events we held at a hospital specializing in pediatrics annually for 2 years to support pediatric cancer patients' siblings. Design/Methods: Study design: A qualitative, descriptive study. Data collection and analysis: The results of observation of siblings before and after the events, in addition to volunteers' and families' comments and impressions, were qualitatively and descriptively analyzed. Ethical considerations: Before the start of each event were provided to obtain consent. Results: For the events, a sibling support program was developed upon deliberations among team members to clarify its purpose, particularly points to be conveyed and appropriate methods to convey them to siblings.The sibling support events mainly aimed to shine a spotlight on siblings, and provide them with an opportunity to express their emotions as a protagonist, and learn about a pediatric hospital through enjoyable play activities. The numbers of participants of the first and second events were 14 (8 males and 6 females) and 13 (3 males and 9 females), respectively, and their age ranged from 3 to 10 years. There were a total of 20 to 25 volunteers, including: nursing university faculty members and students; and CLS. Conclusions: Future challenges of sibling support:The sibling support program was mainly designed for relatively young children. Therefore, in the future, it may be necessary to: consider contents for other age groups, developmental tasks, and periods; use different media; and provide effective support in consideration of individual siblings' situations. Furthermore, as a method to enhance their selfaffirmation and efficacy, it may also be important to provide family support, and convey families' message to siblings. In this respect, sibling support is likely to contribute to improved family functions. P-450 Promoting Treatment Adherence Among Caregivers at the Paediatric Oncology Unit in a Teaching Hospital, Ghana P. Obeng 1, V. Paintsil1, J. Dogbe1, L. OseiTutu1, Hospital, Department of Surgery, Kumasi, Ghana; 3Kumasi Technical University, Faculty of Health Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kumasi, Ghana Background/Objectives: Practical support bears the highest correlation with adherence. Studies suggest that structural or functional social support correlates with patient adherence to medical regimens. Caregivers of children with cancer may provide medical, financial, spiritual or physical support or a combination of all these to ensure their adherence to medications. The study objective was to find out the strategies adopted by caregivers to promote treatment adherence in paediatric oncology in Ghana to improve treatment outcomes. Design/Methods: The study was crosssectional prospective conducted at the Paediatric Oncology Unit (POU) at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH), Ghana from October to December 2016. The POU serves about 30 patients every week. Fifteen patients out of 30 aged 12 years and below were recruited weekly for 10 weeks. A sample size of 150 was used for the study. Data on default, adherence and the strategies adopted by caregivers to improve treatment adherence were obtained after informed consent. Ethical approval was sought before the study was commenced. Results: Default rate was 98 (65.3%). Fiftytwo (34.7%) adhered to treatment of which 37 (71.2%) shared their strategies that enhanced treatment adherence. The strategies for adhering to treatment from the caregivers perspective were financial and emotional support from family and friends 25 (67.6%), KATH POU 19 (51.4%), church 10 (27.0%) and colleague workers 8 (21.6%). Obtaining loans from banks 17 (45.9%), education and counseling from healthcare professionals at POU 8 (21.6%), motivation to save the children 7 (18.9%) and selling of property 5(13.5%) were also enumerated. Conclusions: Financial and emotional support, obtaining loans from banks, education and counseling from healthcare professionals at POU, motivation to save the children and selling of property are the strategies adopted by caregivers to promote treatment adherence. A further study on these strategies will inform outcome improvement interventions. P-451 Risk Factors for Reluctance of Engagement in a SelfManagement Program Among Childhood Cancer Survivors M. Ogasawara 1, S. Background/Objectives: The longterm side effects in cancer survivors have been identified as a factor that reduces patient quality of life and potentially threatens survival. Accordingly, we have been conducting a selfmanagement transition program for childhood cancer survivors to provide a better understanding of their disease and the late effects related to treatment. Although the program teaches patients selfmanagement skills to become ready for care as adults, there has been difficulty with numerous patients due to reluctance to join. We therefore conducted a singleinstitute study to investigate the causes of patient reluctance. Design/Methods: One hundred sixtysix participants were recruited from Nagano Children's Hospital between June 2011 and March 2017. The inclusion criteria were: 1) discharge following intensive chemotherapy/radiotherapy for childhood cancer and 2) age >6 years and able to develop selfmanagement skills. Questionnaire surveys were conducted to determine patient reluctance to engage in the selfmanagement program and medical records were retrospectively analyzed for subject background. Statistical analysis was performed using the 2 test or twotailed Fisher's exact test according to group size. Results: Of the 83 patients meeting the study inclusion criteria, 23 (28%) showed reluctance to engage in the program. Univariate analysis revealed that onset age <7 years (p<0.001), absence of guardian support (p<0.001), having received autologous stem cell transplantation (p<0.05), currently or with a history of receiving treatment related to late effects (p<0.01), embarrassment of physical condition (p<0.05), and cognitive or social development abnormality (p<0.05) were significantly associated with patient hesitance to participate in the selfmanagement program. Conclusions: Multiple risk factors contributed to patient reluctance of engagement in the selfmanagement transition program. Resolving these issues may improve patient compliance and facilitate the development of selfmanagement skills. P-452 Potassium Supplementation and CorticosteroidInduced Neuropsychiatric Effects in Oncology 1, J. Willhoite1, J. Michlitsch1, A. Agrawal1 1Childrens Hospital and Research Center Oakland, Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Oakland, USA Background/Objectives: Glucocorticoids play an essential role in the treatment of multiple pediatric malignancies and are associated with an increase in behavioral disturbances. We aimed to investigate the efficacy of utilizing potassium chloride (KCl) supplementation to reduce corticosteroidinduced neuropsychiatric effects among pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Although utilized anecdotally at some institutions, no prior study has systematically reported data of potential therapeutic benefit. Design/Methods: The charts of pediatric patients with ALL who received KCl supplementation with the intent to reduce corticosteroidinduced neuropsychiatric effects from 20122016 were retrospectively reviewed, and those with baseline and followup visits were analyzed. Primary outcome was the degree of behavioral disturbances pre and postintervention, based on the subjective measure of the treating physician and parents. Results: Seventeen children were included with a median age of 5 years. 88.2% had preB ALL and the majority were in maintenance therapy. Nine patients received dexamethasone; eight received prednisone. Patients received KCl, with a median dose of 0.53mEq/kg/day divided BID, in conjunction with days on corticosteroids. 76.5% of parents reported improvement in neuropsychiatric effects with KCl supplementation. No side effects were reported. Conclusions: Oral KCl supplementation appears beneficial in reducing corticosteroidinduced psychiatric events in children with ALL, with no reported adverse effects. Other notable interventions for steroidinduced neuropsychiatric symptoms include hydrocortisone and antipsychotics, medications with more potential secondary effects. Future prospective, randomized studies are necessary to better examine this effect with the goal of reducing the psychosocial impact of corticosteroids on patients and their families during ALL treatment. P-453 Evaluation of Renal Function Using the Level of Urinary Neutrophil GelatinaseAssociated Lipocaline is not Predictive of Nephrotoxicity Associated MethotrexateBased Chemotherapy M. Pianovski 1, is one of the most widely used anticancer agents, and administration of highdose methotrexate (HDMTX) followed by folinic acid rescue is an important component in the treatment of a variety of childhood cancers. HDMTX can be safely administered to patients with normal renal function by the use of alkalinization, hydration and pharmacokinetically guided folinic acid rescues. Despite these measures, HDMTXinduced renal dysfunction continues to occur. Prompt recognition and treatment of MTXinduced renal dysfuntion are myelosuppression and nephrotoxicity. Delay in the diagnosis of acute kidney injury (AKI) using convention biomarkers, like serum creatinine, has been one of the important obstacles in applying effective early interventions. Several new biomarkers are being evaluated in a quest for early diagnosis of AKI, among which neutrophil gelatinaseassociated lipocalin (NGAL) appears to be promising.This study NGAL levels correlated with methotrexate serum creatinine and urinary NGAL were compared at 0 hour, 2 hours, 6 hours and 3 days after receiving HDMTX intravenous infusions. Results: Seventeen pediatric cancer patients receiving HDMTX chemotherapy were studied including 3 who developed injury, classified by Pediatric Risk Injury Failure Loss End Stage Kidney (pRIFLE). No AKI was registered. Urinary NGAL did not increase during or after the HDMTX treatment. Conclusions: There was no AKI registered by pRIFLE criteria and so NGAL can not be used as an early biomarker for AKI in this situation. P-454 Service Evaluation of the Clinical Value of Routinely Testing Stools for Rotavirus Antigen in a Regional Paediatric Oncology Unit T. Akhtar1, Cargill2, Microbiology, Liverpool, United Kingdom; 3Alder Hey Children's Hospital, Infectious Diseases, Liverpool, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: Diarrhoea is common in paediatric oncology patients; caused by noninfective or infective factors. Rotavirus is historically the most common pathogen causing diarrhoea. However, although stool samples are commonly sent for virology, the value of testing in paediatric oncology patients with diarrhoea is unclear. We conducted a service evaluation to estimate diagnostic yield of rotavirus testing in paediatric oncology patients. It was felt important to undertake this review following the introduction of UKwide rotavirus immunisation in July 2013. Design/Methods: Computerised microbiology records at Alder Hey Children's Hospital from January 2010 to December 2016 (seven years) were reviewed retrospectively to examine stool testing for rotavirus antigen detection in patents treated at a Regional Paediatric Oncology Unit. This review focused only on rotavirus, as testing for other viruses was not consistently undertaken. If repeat samples were submitted for testing within a twoweek period, it was assumed to be part of the same episode and testing was not performed. Results: A total of 1118 samples were reviewed. After rejecting repeat samples taken within two weeks, a total of 819 samples formed the basis for the analysis. Of these 819 samples, 46 (5.6%) were positive for rotavirus from a total of 38 patients (age 019 years, 19 male; 19 female). The results by year (positives/numbers tested and percentages) were as follows: 2010 (15/141,10.6%), 2011 Conclusions: A comprehensive service evaluation of all stool tests performed for rotavirus performed in paediatric oncology patients during a 7year period has demonstrated that the incidence of rotavirus positivity has diminished since the introduction of rotavirus immunisation with only one positive test out of 122 samples in 2015/2016. Based on these results, we suggest there is very little utility for routine rotavirus testing in children and young people with cancer presenting with diarrhoea. P-455 Invasive Fungal Infections in HematoOncology Pediatric Patients: A Eleven Year Review C. Mata Fern\u00e1ndez 1, B. Ponce Salas1, H. Gonzalo Spain Background/Objectives: Invasive fungal infections (IFI) are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in children with hematologic and malignant diseases. Aim: To describe the epidemiology and outcome of IFIs in our hematooncology unit during a elevenyear period. Design/Methods: The medical records of pediatric patients admitted to our hematooncology unit between 20062016 with an IFI were reviewed. Clinical characteristics of mold and yeast infections, and their proportion over time were analyzed. Results: 24 patients were included (62.5% males, median age 6.2 [0.611.9] years) in the study. Hematological malignancies were 41.7%, solid tumors 25%, and benign hematological conditions 29.2%% Overall, 31.7% of patients had undergone haematological stem cell transplant (HSCT),(90% allogenic), 20.8% had suffered graft versus host disease (GVHD),(60% them were admission and 16.7% died. Molds were the most common cause of IFI (62.5%, all bronchopulmonary disease), including 2 confirmed Aspergillus. Yeasts infections included 44.4% fungemias and 44.4% urinary infections, were mostly caused by Candida albicans and Candida parapsilopsis. Patients with mold infections were older (9.32 vs 3.8 years; p=0.010), had higher initial PCR (8.85 vs 4.7mg/dl; 0%,p=0.066). Comparing the first (20062010, 12/24 patients) and second period (20112015, 12/24 patients), the latter had an increased proportion of mold infections (33.3% vs 91.7%,p=0.007), which coincided with higher incidence of the second period of time ( 20112016) there has been an increased proportion of mold infections over yeast infections, with higher severity parameters, along with more intensive myeloablative chemotherapy regimens and an increased survival of these diseases in the last decades. P-456 Prevalence of Malnutrition in Indian Children with Malignancies A Retrospective Study P. Priya 1, A. Gupta1, R. Seth1, J. Sankar1 1All India Institute Of Medical Sciences, Pediatrics, Delhi, India Background/Objectives: Malnutrition is commonly seen in pediatric oncology patients particularly in resource poor countries.There is paucity of data on factors affecting nutritional status and treatment outcomes with malnutrition. The present study was done to estimate prevalence of malnutrition in children with malignancies, to ascertain the degree of malnutrition in hematological vs. nonhematological malignancies,determine factors associated with malnutrition and follow malnourished children of various childhood cancer's for effect on final outcomes. Design/Methods: Retrospective review of records of children 6months to 15 years treated at the Oncology clinic at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, a tertiary medical institute in India, between January 2014 to December2015 was done, Relevant data was retrieved and analysed. Children less than 6 months, with underlying genetic diagnosis/ Immunodeficiency,with associated malabsorption syndromes or chronic systemic diseases were excluded. Results: Total of 542(n=542) newly diagnosed children with malignancies were enrolled in the study period (M:F was 368:174). Children with Retinoblastoma constituted maximum number of patients (47%)followed by acute leukemia, lymphoma and others. Of the total, 36% children were underweight, 28% were stunted and 32% were wasted. Malnutrition in children with solid tumors was 37% and in children with hematological malignancies was 32% (p=0.27).45% children with advanced tumors were malnourished compared to 30% of children with early disease stage(p=0.001). Results were non significant for effect of socioeconomic status and effect on treatment outcomes. Conclusions: Prevalence of malnutrition in various studies at diagnosis varied from 2836%. In our patients 36% children were underweight, 28% were stunted and 32% were wasted.Malnutrition is severe with advanced stage of the malignancies and also when there is lag period from onset of symptoms to starting treatment.Solid tumors are associated with greater degree of malnutrition. There is no significant effect of socioeconomic status on nutrition and there is no statistically significant effect of malnutrition on final outcomes. P-457 Lifestyle Advice Provision to Teenage and Young Adult Cancer Patients: The Perspective of Health Professionals in the United Kingdom G. Pugh 1, R. Hough2, H. Gravestock3, A. Fisher4 1University College London, Department of Behavioural Science and Health, London, United Kingdom; 2University College Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Clinical Haematology, London, United Kingdom; 3CLIC Sargent, Research and Policy, London, United Kingdom; 4University College London, Department of Behavioural Health and Science, London, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: There are currently no health behaviour interventions available in the United Kingdom to support Teenage and Young Adult Cancer Survivors (TYACS) after a cancer diagnosis. Formative studies conducted by our group demonstrate that most UK TYACS desire ageappropriate health behaviour information on physical activity, diet, smoking, alcohol consumption, and sun safety, delivered in multiple formats, at various timepoints throughout the cancer pathway. Health professionals were also identified as an important source of information for TYACS. However, little is known about health professionals' provision of lifestyle advice to young people with cancer who are in their care. Design/Methods: An online survey was conducted to assess TYA health professionals awareness of lifestyle guidance and provision of lifestyle advice to TYACS in their care. Health professionals views on lifestyle information format and delivery were also explored. Results: Ninetyfive health professionals (44% nurses; 28% allied health professionals; 17% physicians) completed the survey. The majority (72%) of respondents were aware of some lifestyle guidance for cancer patients. However, less than half of TYA health professionals (46%) were able to successfully recall the source of the guidelines and less than a third (2327%) reported proving specific advice to the majority of their patients on some health behaviours. Many health professionals (38%) felt they were not the right person to provide advice and cited lack of resources as a key barrier to advice provision. The majority (95%) reported being interested in a resource containing relevant lifestyle information that could be given to young people with cancer. Conclusions: TYA health professionals' awareness of lifestyle guidance and provision of advice regarding health behaviour is suboptimal. Clear and comprehensive guidance written specifically for TYA health professionals could overcome the reported barriers and improve professionals' confidence in addressing and providing advice on lifestyle to young people with cancer. P-458 Pain Experience Profile in Children with Cancer: Prospective Analysis of 2216 Treatment Days in a Developing Country K. Riad 1, M. Mohamed2, A. Morsy1 1South Egypt Cancer Institute, pediatric oncology, Assiut, 2South Cancer Institute, Anesthesiology and Pain Management, Assiut, Egypt Background/Objectives: Cancer in children is a potentially curable disease, How to deal with pain is an integral part of symptom management in pediatric cancer patients in general. Proper recognition of underlying pathophysiology and various causes of pain are so essential for pain management, and for ameliorating suffering in the realm of holistic care for children with cancer. The aim of this study is to address and meticulously analyze the spectrum of pain characteristics in children with cancer at an institutional university cancer center to unravel pain profile in these patients as an experience for a developing country Design/Methods: A hospital based, prospective study was conducted, involving pediatric cancer patients, who presented with pain due to cancer itself or its treatment in the period from 2013Jul to 2015 Jan. Evaluation of patients' documented pain cycles for pain cause, type, and location & also for pain treatment characteristics was done. Results: A total of 286 pain cycles was documented comprising 2216 treatment days (range 356 days). Diseaserelated pain was the most frequent cause of pain in our study. Oral mucosa was the most frequent site for treatmentrelated pain & strongly correlated with NHL diagnosis. Leukemia was strongly correlated with \"the extremities\" as a location of bone pain. Visceral pain was most often associated with lymphomas. Neuropathic pain was the least frequent type of pain, however, associated with higher initial pain intensity scores & longer pain cycle duration. Conclusions: Children with cancer in the developing countries still have more diseaserelated pain than their counterparts in the developed countries. Pain experience may indirectly reflect presentations of childhood cancer, and could be a surrogate profile for tumor location, metastatic sites, the degree of treatment intensity, likewise the context of the disease state either at diagnosis, during treatment, or at progression. P-459 Myocardial Changes in Childhood Cancer Patients Treated with Anthracyclines K. Riad 1, F. Ahmad2, R. Mohamed3, A. Ali1, A. Morsy1, Pediatric Egypt Background/Objectives: Anthracyclineinduced cardiotoxicity in survivors of childhood cancer initially presenting as subclinical cardiac abnormalities that, if left undetected or untreated, can lead to clinical cardiac dysfunction. The present study aimed to evaluate the early myocardial changes that develop with anthracycline therapy Design/Methods: In this prospective study the preanthracycline and 6months postanthracycline echocardiographic and electrocardiographic parameters were analyzed for cardiac dysfunction. The demographic information, including age, sex, type of anthracycline, and cumulative dose, were recorded, as well Results: In this study, 115 patients with childhood cancer, including 81 males (70.4%) and 34 females (29.6%) with the mean age of 11.1\u00b13.8 years were enrolled. Their normal baseline and 6months postanthracycline echocardiographic and electrocardiographic parameters were compared for myocardial changes. Doxorubicin alone was used in 91 (79%) patients while daunorubicin alone in 24 (21%). Only 16 children (14%) received a high dose of anthracycline (cumulative dose > 300 mg/m2 ). QTc interval significantly prolonged 6months after chemotherapy than the baseline readings (P<0.001). There was a significant increase in the left ventricular dimensions, and all myocardial functional parameters were significantly deteriorated in children who received anthracycline (P<0.001). The incidence of cardiac dysfunction found more in female patients (20/28; 71.4%). Myocardial dysfunction was significantly higher among children who received a high cumulative dose of doxorubicin (P<0.001). Conclusions: The incidence of subclinical anthracyclinerelated cardiac dysfunction is high. Children treated with anthracycline require a longterm followup to identify and establish optimal prevention and management strategies that balance oncologic efficacy with longterm safety. P-460 Correlation Between MultiDrug Resistant Organism Colonization and Blood Stream Infections in Children with Haematolymphoid Malignancies in a LowMiddle Income Country N. Salifu 1, Desai1, B. Arora1, Periera1, Hospital, Pediatric Oncology, Mumbai, India; 2Tata Memorial Hospital, Microbiology, Mumbai, India Background/Objectives: Colonization with multidrug resistant organisms (MDRO) is associated with a higher morbidity and mortality in children with cancer. The Expert Group of the 4th European Conference of Infections in Leukemia (ECIL4) developed guidelines for empirical antibiotic therapy in febrile neutropenic patients where 'escalation' or 'deescalation' strategies are employed based on colonization with drugresistant organisms among other factors. Our unit employed a \"deescalation\" policy based on colonization, due to a high incidence of MDRO bloodstream infections (BSI). A retrospective audit of this practice was done to determine its usefulness. Design/Methods: Records from Jan2015 to Jul2016 were examined. Rectal swabs of all patients registered with haematolymphoid malignancies were obtained within seven days of presentation. Blood cultures were taken during febrile episodes from peripheral veins. Centrallines were also cultured, if present. Data was collated and analyzed with descriptive analytical tools. Results: Rectal swab positivity rate was 78.3% from 3,455 cultures. Incidence of MDRO and extended spectrum betalactamase producing organisms (ESBLO) colonization in these was 32.0% and 36.6% respectively. Overall 6.63% of 4,490 blood cultures were positive. Paired positive rectal swabs with positive blood cultures were 253. MDRO colonization was seen in 90(35.6%) of the 253 culture pairs, while 95(37.5%) patients were colonized with (ESBLO). Fortysix (51.1%) BSIs (p<0.05), while 12(13.3%) grew ESBLO. Significant association was also seen in 24(25.3%) patients colonized with ESBLO whose blood culture isolated organisms with same sensitivity (p<0.001). Thirtyfour (35.8%) patients colonized with ESBLO had BSIs There is a high incidence of MDRO and ESBLO colonization at presentation in pediatric hematolymphoid malignancy patients at our center. In those developing BSIs with MDRO and ESBLO, baseline colonization status with these organisms was significantly correlated. A deescalation of antibiotics strategy would be justified in management of febrile neutropenia in our subject population. P-461 The Utility of a Prognostic Scoring System in a Resource Limited Pediatric Oncology Setting: The Adaptation and Implementation of the Pediatric Early Warning Score H. Sankaran 1, V. Gopakumar2, P. Komoravolu1 1Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences, Department of Medical Oncology, Ernakulam, India; 2Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences, Department of Nursing, Ernakulam, India Background/Objectives: The use of pediatric early warning score (PEWS) systems to identify deteriorating pediatric oncology patients in the developed world has been extensively studied and implemented. However, many PEWS systems are complex and difficult to implement in resource limited settings. A prospective study was performed to implement an adapted PEWS system and reduce pediatric code events. Design/Methods: Agedependent physiologic parameters and qualitative measures (heart rate, respiratory rate, respiratory distress, parental concern, comorbidity, oxygen need, consciousness) were used to design a PEWS system. The study period compared primary outcome measures 6 months before and after implementation of PEWS in October 2016. Primary outcome measures were defined as pediatric code events, and sepsis related ICU transfers for PEWS above 5. Sensitivity and specificity of the PEWS system were calculated at the end of the study period. Testing to determine health care provider recognition of abnormal agedependent physiologic parameters was conducted before and after implementation of the PEWS system. Results: 101 inpatient pediatric oncology admissions were available for analysis. Statistical significance could not be evaluated for the pediatric codes as after implementation there were no events compared to 4 events before implementation. The sensitivity of the PEWS system to identify patients requiring ICU admissions was 66.7% with a specificity of 100% using a PEWS cutoff of 4. Length of ICU stay significantly decreased (6.1 vs. 4.9 days, p=0.02) after implementation. Provider recognition of abnormal vital signs increased by 20% after implementation of the PEWS system. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first PEWS system to be implemented in India. This study has demonstrated the feasibility and benefit of a PEWS system in the Indian environment. Further studies are being done decreasing the PEWS cutoff score to increase the sensitivity of this tool in our setting and making this generalizable to other hospitals in India. P-462 Antibiotic Resistance in Paediatric Haematolgy and Oncology Patients -Glasgow Justification I. K. HarveyWood1, A. Balfour1 1Royal Hospital for Children, Haematology and Oncology, Glasgow, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: Bacterial infections are a major obstacle to the treatment of febrile neutropenia in paediatric haematooncology patients. Improvement in management strategies, including the use of broadspectrum antibacterial drugs targeting Gramnegative bacteria, has reduced the mortality in neutropenic patients developing blood stream and other severe infections. However the development of multiresistant bacteria, such aspseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus, Vancomycin resistant enterococcus pose a major threat for such patients. This audit aims to determine the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in our unit, where first line agents used are Piperacillin and tazobactam(Tazocin) and gentamicin Design/Methods: We collected retrospectively, the results of microbiological tests from a variety of specimen including blood cultures and the sensitivities to various antibiotics of positive cultures, over a period of 22 months from January 2014 to October 2015. All paediatric haematooncology patients admitted to the unit were included. The data was obtained from electronic records kept in the bacteriology department. Results: A total of 610 positive microbiological tests were noted during the audit period of which 207 showed resistance to one or more antibiotics (34%). 201 blood cultures were positive out of 2217 (9%). 88 of these had resistance to at least one drug (44%). A total of 126 positive cultures with sensitivity to Tazocin were recorded of which resistance was noted in 37(29%). 68 positive blood cultures had tazocin sensitivity reported of which 15 were resistant (22%). Meropenem sensitivity was reported in 121 positive cultures of which 22 were resistant (18%) Amikacin sensitivity was reported in 96 positive cultures of which 21 were resistant (22%). Conclusions: In view of the prevalence of high resistance to Tazocin, the addition of gentamicin is justified in our unit. Alternatively, single agent meropenem could be considered for those patients where gentamicin is contraindicated.Continued vigilance is essential to choose the appropriate empirical antibiotics P-463 Prevalence of Fungal Infections in Paediatric HaematoOncology Patients: Effectiveness of Selective Antifungal Glasgow L. Torrens1, K. A. Balfour1, E. Davies1 1Royal Hospital for Haematology Oncology, Glasgow, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are an important concern in immunocompromised patients and treatment of these infections can be difficult once established. So emphasis has been placed on strategies of prevention, such as use of high efficient particulate air filter, isolation and use anti fungal prophylactic drugs. This audit was undertaken to study the prevalence of fungal infections among paediatric haematooncology patients and to determine the effectiveness of unit's antifungal prophylaxis in preventing IFIs. Design/Methods: A retrospective audit involved all the immunocompromised patients treated in our unit with positive fungal culture or aspergillus PCR over a six month period between 1st February 2016 and 31st July 2016. The patients were identified using electronic databases from microbiology and virology department. A proforma was used to collect clinicopathological information from the hospital electronic patient records and case notes. Results: 107 positive fungal cultures and or aspergillus PCR tests were detected which translanted into 67 fungal infections from 42 patients (male 24, female 18). 62 of these were localised (mucocutaneous) and 5 were IFIs. 56 were candida (31 albicans, 9 parpsilosis, 6 lambica and 10 others), 3 saccharomyces, 1 aspergillus, 1 monilla and 6 yeast species. Specimen from where fungi were cultured or detected included surface swabs, urine, stools, blood and tissue. IFIs were noted in 3(7.5%) patients (lungs, blood and spleen). IFIs resulted in ICU admission, splenectomy, loss of CVAD and interruption of chemotherapy. 6 patients were on anti fungal prophylaxis and did not develop IFIs. Conclusions: Most fungal infections were superficial (mucocutaneous). IFIs were noted in minority of patients but resulted in adverse outcome. Children who were on anti fungal prophylaxis in this cohort, never developed IFIs although the number was small. Unit's antifungal policy needs to be aligned with international protocols, to prevent IFIs in those who are at significant risk. P-464 Cost and Pattern of Use of Supportive Care for Pediatric Cancer Patients in Tanzania M. Tesfaye1, A. Saxton2, M. Bhattacharya3, N. Masalu4, Oncology, raleigh, USA Background/Objectives: Although supportive and preventive care play a crucial role in the successful management of childhood cancer, little is known about the use of these interventions in low resource settings and the costs associated with this treatment. This is essential information for the development of a pediatric cancer program. We examined the usage patterns and direct costs for supportive and preventive care for the treatment of children with cancer in Tanzania at the Bugando Medical Center, one of only two hospitals in the country treating pediatric cancer. Design/Methods: A retrospective chart review of hospital admissions and clinic visits from January 2010August 2014 was performed. Utilization and cost of preventive care (laboratory, imaging, and medications to evaluate and prevent chemotherapy toxicity) and supportive care (blood transfusions, antibiotics, and infection studies) were recorded. Conversions from the local currency (Tsh) to International Dollars (Intl. $) were performed. Tradable goods (i.e. medications) were converted using the prevailing exchange rate (2189.06Tsh/USD). Nontradable goods (clinical & lab supplies). were converted using purchasing power parity exchange rates obtained from the World Bank (779.205Tsh/Int $). Results: Files for 161 patients were available. For chemotherapy encounters, 82% had labs to monitor toxicity, 85% were prescribed antiemetics and only 27% received intravenous fluids. Only 25% of patients receiving cardiotoxic chemotherapy had an echocardiogram. The mean cost incurred for preventive and supportive care was $153 and $43 per patient, respectively. Taken together, these accounted for less than 20% of total treatment costs. Conclusions: Our findings show that although there is a capacity to deliver supportive and preventive cancer care to pediatric patients in Tanzania, these services are not always routinely delivered to patients. The relatively low cost of these services demonstrate their merit to be included in pediatric cancer programs in low resource settings. P-465 Use of and Beliefs About Integrative Medicine in a Pediatric Oncology Clinic: Parent and Adolescent/Young Adult Perspectives L. Schwartz 1, HenryMoss1, O. Natalie2, Medicine, Philadelphia, USA; 3Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Integrative Medicine, New York, USA Background/Objectives: Integrative Medicine (IM; e.g., massage, acupuncture, mediation, herbs) has been explored in adult oncology, but there is limited such research in pediatric oncology. Understanding use of complementary therapies in pediatric oncology, as well as beliefs, barriers, and support of IM, can help inform how these treatments are discussed with patients. We aimed to survey parents and adolescent/young adult patients (AYA) to gauge their use of and perspectives related to IM. Design/Methods: A convenience sample of patients 1424 yo and parents (not required to be matched dyads) provided information on demographics, treatment, and the use of and perceived benefit of 13 IM methods. The Attitudes and Beliefs about Complementary and Alternative Medicine (ABCAM) scale was used to rate expected benefits, perceived barriers, and subjective norms. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize scale scores and ratings of IM use. Chisquared and ttests were used to calculate relationships with IM use. Results: Parent participants (n=140) were 82% female, 70% nonHispanic white, and 81% had completed at least some college. Their children has Mage of 11 and 39% had completed treatment. AYA patients (n= 52) had a Mage of 19; 63% were male, 67% nonHispanic white, and 50% had completed treatment. Use of IM treatment since cancer diagnosis was 51% for parents and 60% for patients. Expressive arts therapy was the most commonly reported method among parents (26%) and patients (35%). Ratings of perceived benefit of IM were high. Parents endorsed wanting relaxation techniques for their children (79%); AYA patients were most interested in massage (64%). For parents, reporting IM use was associated with level of education (p=0.04) and subjective norm score (p=0.003). Benefits (p=0.001), barriers (p=0.02), and subjective norms (p=0.02) scores were associated with IM use for AYA patients. Conclusions: Use of IM is common in pediatric oncology and should be routinely discussed with patients. P-466 Improving the Quality of FollowUp Care for Pediatric Cancer Survivors: A MixedMethods Study on Preferences for Models of Survivorship 2University of Lucerne, Department of Health Sciences and Health Policy, Lucerne, Switzerland; 3Hudson Institute, Australian and New Zealand Children's 4Paediatric haematology/oncology, Department of Clinical Haematology/Oncology, Adelaide, Australia; 5University of Melbourne, Victorian Comprehensive Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia Background/Objectives: As the population of children surviving cancer grows, the importance of promoting essential, lifelong, survivorshipfocused care becomes critical. However, many survivors are disengaged from followup care, mandating alternative models of care to encourage survivor engagement. To facilitate this, we explored survivors' and parents' preferences regarding the delivery of survivorship care. Design/Methods: Australian and New Zealand survivors and parents (of survivors aged less than 16 years) completed surveys and optional interviews on their followup care preferences. We used multiple logistic regression to identify clinical/demographic associations with preferred survivorship care. Results: 403 survivors (mean age: 26.8years) and 207 parents (child mean age: 12.4years) completed surveys, complemented by 107 interviews. 46% of survivors were disengaged from care (not received cancerrelated care in last 2 years), and reported significantly greater dissatisfaction with the healthcare they were receiving (50% versus 16% of clinic attendees dissatisfied, 2=43.529, p<0.001). Survivors preferred followup clinic afterhours (44.9%), and separate from pediatric patients (31.8%) and from patients on active treatment (27.2%). End of treatment, one, and five years posttreatment completion were equally endorsed among survivors as the preferred timing to begin followup care. Survivors' treating oncologist was the most favored professional for followup (62.5%), and primary care physicians were least preferred (10%). Survivors who were further from diagnosis (p=0.018), those who worried more about risk of recurrence (p=0.044), who reported fewer late effects (p=0.011) and had more unmet information needs (p=0.044) were more likely to prefer oncologistled versus primary or nurseled survivorship care. Conclusions: Incorporating survivors' preferences into future models of care may improve engagement in essential followup, as well as satisfaction with care, ensuring survivorship needs are better met. This may help reduce the longterm physical and psychosocial burden on survivors following treatment for pediatric cancer. P-467 The Use of Complementary and Alternative Medicine Among the Pediatric Cancer Patients in Ankara University School of Medicine Pediatric Oncology Clinic I. Bulut1, N. Tacyildiz 2, E. Unal3, H. Dincaslan4, G. University Med School, Pediatrics, Ankara, Turkey; \u00dcniversity Faculty of Medicine, Pediatric Oncology, Ankara, University Med School, Pediatric Oncolgy, Ankara, 4Ankara University Med School, Pediatric Oncology, Ankara, Turkey; 5Ankara University School Of Medicine Ufuk University School of Medicine, Pediatric Oncology, Ankara, Turkey Background/Objectives: Complamantary Altarnative Medicine (CAM) is mostly traditional treatment modalities that most of the cancer patients may involve either informing their doctors or not. Since some of these treatment modalities may interfere with chemotherapy it is important to know if the patient is getting any of them. Design/Methods: Frequency and reasons of the use of CAM, types of CAM method, sociodemographic characteristics of the patients that use CAM among the children that are being monitored with the diagnosis of cancer in Ankara University School of Medicine. In this crosssectional study, between FebruaryNovember 2015, 139 pediatric cancer patients and their families were applied the survey form facetoface when they are inpatient or outpatient clinic. Results: Mean age was 8.65\u00b15.51(min:0.5,maks;18) years, 54.7% were male. The average age of patients which use CAM was 10.6\u00b15.42, while mean age was 7.9\u00b15.39(p<0.05) for didn't use CAM group. Patients with lower socioeconomic status were tend to use more CAM. Advanced staged patients were found to have increased frequency of the use of CAM. All patients participating this study have mentioned about praying. About 27% of the patients were using other CAM methods as well. The patients that used CAM mostly used honey (59.5%), bee pollen/milk (56.8%) and molasses (%45.9). Almost 38% of the families were found to have applied for religious help for their patients (Hodja reading holy passages which are believed to be beneficiary). About 38% of the patients using CAM have informed their doctor. The most common reason of not consulting to physicians was thought of possible rejection(78.3%). Conclusions: Most of patients are using CAM methods without the knowledge of physicians. None of the patients use CAM instead of medical treatment. All of the patients that admitted to hospital must be sufficiently informed,possible side effects of CAM and should given opportunity discuss with their doctors. P-468 Improving Function in Pediatric Cancer Survivors: The Lasting Impact of the Stoplight Program L. Tanner 1 1Children's Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Services, Minneapolis, USA Background/Objectives: Survivors of pediatric acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) can have muscle strength deficits, symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, and range of motion limitations months to years after treatment. A proactive physical therapy intervention, The Stoplight Program (SLP) was implemented at a single institution with the goal of preventing and minimizing these deficits in body function and activity limitations. Children who completed the SLP during their ALL treatment tested within healthy norms for developmental age. In this followup study, we continued to measure their function after treatment to evaluate the longer term impact of the SLP. The study objective was to measure body function and activity limitations in ALL survivors who completed the SLP and compare them to a historical control group of ALL survivors who completed their cancer treatment before the SLP was implemented Design/Methods: In this quasiexperimental study, two cohorts of pediatric ALL survivors ages 5 to 18 years were assessed 18 to 24 months after completing ALL treatment. Measurements were administered by a physical therapist and included the BruininksOseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency and ankle range of motion (AROM). An independentsamples ttest was used to assess differences between groups and correlations were analyzed between AROM and motor tests results. Results: The historical control group and SLP intervention group did not differ significantly in mean age (9 years) or time off ALL treatment (20 months). The SLP group had significantly better AROM (p = .001) and scale scores for bilateral coordination (p = .05), running speed/agility (p = .01), and strength (p = .02). AROM had a positive correlation with survivors' strength/agility percentile rank. Conclusions: The SLP is an innovative, proactive physical therapy intervention that continues to significantly impact children after ALL treatment. Creative approaches are needed to support the healthy development of children during and after cancer treatment. P-469 Barriers to Effective Nursing Pain Management and Assessment of Children with Cancer on the Paediatric Oncology Unit, at the KorleBu Teaching Hospital, Accra Ghana B. TiekuWard 1, W. EyiahMensah1 1Korle Bu Teaching Hospital, Department of Child Health, Accra, Ghana Background/Objectives: The level of pain assessment and management among nurses is recently on the decline. This study sought to find out barriers to effective pain assessment and its management. Design/Methods: Ten nurses who are working at the pediatric oncology unit of Korle Bu Teaching Hospital were randomly selected for this study. Results: Majority of the nurses, sixty percent was within the age bracket group thirty one to fourty years. Eighty percent have obtained their bachelor's degree in nursing and majority has more than five years' experience in oncology nursing. The research revealed that nurses are most abreast with the use of analgesics as pain management skills as to psychosocial and diversional therapy. Thus, unavailability of analgesics (morphine) because some parents cannot afford, is a barrier to effective pain management. Most often children are only assessed at the onset of their pain when they cry or verbalize it. Twenty percent of nurses noted that pain assessment tools are not readily available on the unit. Ninety percent of the nurses do not find the pain assessment procedure time consuming. Sixty percent perceive that the female patients exaggerate pain in order to get morphine, thus the fear for administering opioid. According to seventy percent of the nurses, doctors are not willing to prescribe morphine when suggested after a pain assessment and it is thus a barrier to further pain management and assessment. Conclusions: In conclusion, nurses need further education on early identification of pain in children and infants with cancer by the use of Behavioral Pain Assessment Scale (FLACC), since pain is effectively managed when detected early, as well as, to assess and manage pain consistently on the ward. Funds should be raised to support parents in purchasing morphine. Diversional therapy activities like puzzle games is encouraged in the unit. P-470 Validation of the Oncological Pediatric Early Warning Score (OPEWS) on Critical Patients with HaematoOncological Diagnosis A. Tondo 1, C. Rosa1, F. Italy Background/Objectives: Patients with oncologicalhaematological diagnosis are subject to potentially fatal complications. In the last years a scoring system has been developed, based on rapidly assessable clinical parameters, called Pediatric Early Warning Score (PEWS), to detect critical events in a timely manner and rapidly activate the emergency team. This study aims at finding an adaptation of this system for the pediatric patients with haematooncological diagnosis, called OncolgicalPEWS (OPEWS), and evaluate its accuracy in reflecting the level of clinical impairment of the observed patients. Design/Methods: We modified the PEWS in order to include clinical parameters that reflect the neurocognitive, cardiovascular, respiratory and urinary state of the pediatric patients with haematooncological diagnosis. A retrospective pilot study has been conducted on twentysix patients that required admission in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU), measuring the OPEWS scores at admission and correlating those scores with the outcome. Results: The patients that were admitted in the PICU with a lower score (average OPEWS = 7/15) reached a better outcome. The survival rate proved lower (31% vs 69%) in patients with higher score at admission (average OPEWS = 9/15), correlating with negative prognostic factor such as use of mechanic ventilation and ultrafiltration. Conclusions: This pilot study demonstrated that the OncologicalPEWS is capable of predicting the clinical seriousness of the pediatric patients with haematooncological diagnosis. We are now conducting a perspective multicenter observational study aiming at a more consistent validation of the OPEWS and of its ability of precociously identify all those patients that require an emergency consult and a potential take on responsability of the patient by the PICU. P-471 Alternative and Complementary Medicine Use Among Pediatric Patients with Oncological Diseases in a Latinamerican Country M. Velazquezavina 1, J. Pe\u00f1alozaGonz\u00e1lez1 Mexico Background/Objectives: Alternative/Complementary Medicine (ACM) refers to medical practices that are not in accordance with the standards of the medical community. ACM use is frequently used by patients with chronic or catastrophic diseases, but the treating physician ignores its use. The reported frequency of use in Mexico ranges from 30% to 84% according to various surveys. Design/Methods: We included patients from the Pediatric Oncology Service at our institution who had been receiving treatment for at least three months. A structured questionnaire was administered in person by a single interviewer (pediatric oncologist). We recorded the cancer type, ACM used, and parent/guardian age, and education level. We present descriptive statistics of the sample and clinical findings as means \u00b1 standard deviation, and proportion comparisons with Pearson's chisquare test. Results: Of the 133 parents interviewed, 84.2% used some form of ACM. Herbs and minerals were the most frequently used (35.3%), followed by diet and nutrition (25.6%) and mind, body, and spirit (19.5%) therapies. The most frequent cancers were hematological malignancies in a proportion 3:1 versus solid tumors. The parents education level was not associated with more frequent ACM use, nor did mother's age. Father's age was significantly related to more frequent ACM use, especially if they were 40 yearsold or older. Conclusions: Our study population used very frequently ACM as an adjuvant therapy, in both, hematological and solid tumors. No subject attempted to abandon conventional treatment and rely solely on ACM. This study may lead to further studies that assess the results obtained from patients receiving ACM. P-472 Infectious Disease Agents in Febrile Neutropenia in Patients with Childhood Cancer at a National Refrence Hospital M. Velazquezavina 1, M. Huitr\u00f3nHern\u00e1ndez1, J. Pe\u00f1alozaGonz\u00e1lez1 Oncology, Mexico City, Mexico Background/Objectives: Approximately 80% of patients with childhood cancer and chemotherapy treatment will have an episode of febrile neutropenia (FN). The percentage of positive blood cultures is correlated with the risk of overall infection. The purpose of the present study is to describe the percentage of positive blood cultures and the infectious disease agent. Design/Methods: We reviewed all blood cultures of patients with childhood cancer from August 2015 to December 2016 at our institution. We described percentages of negative or positive blood cultures and identified the disease agent in case of positive testing. The demographic and clinical characteristics are described as means or proportions according to variable type. Results: We included 171 blood cultures. The patient average age was 10.4 years. In 52% of the cultures the result was negative, and 48% were positive. Fiftyone percent of our patients were female and 49% were male. According to the type of cancer, highrisk acute lymphoblastic leukemia represented 42.1% of our population, osteosarcoma 22.8%, 9.9% germ cell tumors and the rest were patients with Hodgkin disease and rhabdomyosarcoma. Gram positive bacteria were isolated in 53.9% of positive cultures, and Gram negative bacteria in 46.1% of positive cultures. The most frequent Gram positive bacteria was Staphylococcus epidermidis followed by Staphylococus aureus and Staphylococcus hominis. The most frequent Gram negative bacteria was Escherichia coli followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Acinetobacter baumanii. Gram positive bacteria were more frequently isolated in female patients, whereas Gram negative bacteria were most frequently isolated in male patients. Conclusions: The percentage of positive blood cultures in our practice is relatively high compared to other series. The most frequent infectious disease was a Gram positive agent. Although not statistically significant, we found a difference of disease agent according to gender. P-473 Nutritional Status of Children with Cancer at Diagnosis in Brazil K. Viani 1, M. Neto Rafael1, da Crian\u00e7a do Hospital das Cl\u00ednicas Sao Paulo University Medical School, Nutrition, Sao Paulo, Brazil; 2Columbia University, Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology/Stem Cell Transplant, New York, USA; 3McMaster University and McMaster Children's Hospital Hamilton Health Sciences, Department of Pediatrics, Hamilton, Canada; 4Instituto de Tratamento do C\u00e2ncer Infantil da Crian\u00e7a do Hospital das Cl\u00ednicas Sao Paulo University Medical School, Department of Pediatrics, Sao Paulo, Brazil Background/Objectives: The relationship between nutritional status (NS) at diagnosis and survival in pediatric oncology has been described by several authors. Considering the overall importance of NS in these patients, the objectives of this study were: to determine the NS of children with cancer at diagnosis; compare the NS between patients with solid tumors (ST), hematological malignancies (HM) and central nervous system tumors (CNST); and compare the NS distribution by two different anthropometric parameters. Design/Methods: This is a retrospective crosssectional study. Data on weight, height and midupper arm circumference (MUAC) measured within 7 days of diagnosis were collected from the nutrition service records of a hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil. For comparison, NS was classified by both body mass index z scores (BMIz), using WHO growth charts, and MUAC percentiles. NS classifications by BMIz and MUAC were compared using the Chisquare test. Results: We included 370 patients in the study, mean age 7.8(\u00b15) years. The diagnoses distribution was: to 14% patients were below adequate, 79.8% adequate and 6.2% above adequate, whereas MUAC percentiles classified 12.4% as below adequate, 78.3% adequate and 9.32% above adequate, without statistical difference between the anthropometric parameters (p=0.726). Regarding patients with HM, ST and CNST, the groups were equivalent by BMIz (p=0.142). However they differed in MUAC percentiles (p=0.006). Although HM presented no divergence between BMIz and MUAC (p=0.698), more children with ST were undernourished by MUAC (24.7%) than BMIz (15.6%), p=0.075, 21.8%, p=0.011). Conclusions: The undernutrition prevalence in our study was 2 to 3 times higher than in the general population of Brazilian children/adolescents, especially in patients with ST and CNST. MUAC appears more sensitive than BMIz as indicator of undernutrition at diagnosis for patients with ST. P-474 Screening of Vitamin D Deficiency in Children with cancer. Cause or Just a Consequence of Malignancy? L.P. Xalafova, R.S. Ismayilzade National Center L. Xalafova 1, R.S. Ismayilzade1 1Pediatric Clinic of the National Center of Oncology (NCO) of Azerbaijan, Baku, Azerbaijan Background: Recent studies have identified an important function of vitamin D (VD) in regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation, and apoptosis. In addition vitamin D deficiency (VDD) has been linked to an increased cancer risk, prompting us to screening of VDD in children with cancer. Procedure: From 06.02.2015 to 28.02. 2017(24 months) in our center a survey was done of 191 children. Level of VD, age, sex, time of sampling and presence of malignant tumor were determined. 25hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) concentrations in the serum were measured in all patients at the time of diagnosis and during treatment and levels were categorized as normal (>=30ng/ml), insufficient (2029ng/ml), or deficient (<20ng/ml). The timing of sample collection was classified into four seasons. The age ranged from 4 months to 21 years. Results: We evaluated a total of 191 patients for this study: 131(68.57%) had a diagnose malignancy and 60(31.41%) had nonmalignant disorders (NMD). VDD was detected in 101(77.1%) of the patients with malignancy. Particularly alarming was the fact that VDD in 14(13.86%) patients was detected prior to the start of treatment. VDI was identified in 19 cases (14.5%), and normal levels had only 11 patients (8.4%).The boys 59(58.42%) prevailed over girls 42(41.58%). More than 50% of VDD were determined in children aged 715 years (54.46%). In 60 children with NMD VDD was determined in 32(53.33%) and VDI in 14(23.33%) cases. Conclusion: Azerbaijan is a country with 2700 sunny hours/year. Despite this, we discovered VDD cases in 77.1% of pediatric cancer patients and 53.33% of children with NMD in our survey. Further research is needed to determine whether the VDD is a cause of malignancy or just a consequence of it. Our study supports intake of vitamin D for possible prevention of cancer in children. P-475 Verification of the Knowledge of Dietary Therapy of the Care Team: A Strategy of Continuing Education for a Pediatric Oncology Hospital L. Xavier Del Rio 1, M. Santos Murra2, N. Duran Leite2 1Barretos Cancer Hospital, Nutrition, Franca, Brazil; 2Barretos Cancer Hospital, Nutrition, Barretos, Brazil Background/Objectives: There are many questions related to nutrition in the clinical practice of the multidisciplinary team. Investigating doubts and implementing interventions could be ways to address uncertainties and minimize errors related to nutritional support. The aims of the study was to investigate, evaluate and describe the knowledge related to nutrition in the nursing and nutrition and dietetics teams of a children's cancer hospital, before and after educational interventions. Design/Methods: The teams to be approached were defined, corresponding to cupbearers/ kitchen assistants and nurses/ nursing technicians of the Intensive Care Unit, Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation and ward. Two questionnaires were prepared, one for each team, and applied on the first day (D1). Two interventions occurred at D7 and D14. Subjects such as neutropenia, types of diets and feeding routes, were discussed. A second questionnaire application occurred on the D75. The results were analyzed with the statistical package SPSS 21.0. Results: Fortyseven professionals participated in this study. However, only fifteen performed the second questionnaire. The scores obtained by the nutrition and dietetics team in the first questionnaire were 2.0 to 6.0 points (poor to regular grades). The nursing team's scores were 1.0 to 5.0 points in the first moment (poor to bad grades). There was a significant increase (p <0.05) in scores of the second questionnaire for both teams, going from 5.0 to 7.0 (regular to good grades) for the first team and 3.0 to 9.0 (bad to great grades) for the second team. In comparison of the demographic characteristics of the nursing team, the sector and the working time were statistically different for those who answered the second questionnaire. Conclusions: Good retention rates have been demonstrated for those who participated of all stages of the study, but it is necessary to associate the theory with the practice performed by the teams. Treatment and Care Palliative Care P-476 Evaluation of the Acute Biochemical Changes in DLBCL Patients Treated with and Without Rituximab K. ali 1 1National Institute of Blood Diseases and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Pharmacy, karachi, Pakistan Background/Objectives: The background of conducted study was to determine adverse implications on metabolic profile of DLBCL patients deal with CHOP and RCHOP. With a concise determination of the changes in metabolic profile correlated with dose intensity ratio, the findings of this study will be helpful in choices for the physician to discontinue therapy, delaying treatment or alternating regimen. Design/Methods: This was prospective study conducted at National Institute of blood diseases and bone marrow transplantation. In this study baseline readings of liver enzymes, urea, creatinine and electrolytes levels was taken and treated as control readings. Posttreatment readings of aforesaid parameters were taken after 20 days. Means of above readings was calculated and compared with common terminology criteria for adverse events v3.0 2006 (CTCAE) to find the differences in biochemical parameters at baseline (control group) and 20 days posttreatment (treatment group) to identify the types of toxicity (mild moderate or severe) as define by v3.0 2006 (CTCAE). Results: Among patients with CHOP therapy, was observed before and after the treatment whereas among patients with RCHOP no significant difference was observed in any biochemical analysis (pvalue >0.05). Conclusions: Despite the fact, subjects at baseline metabolic or biochemical investigation impairments should be corrected rigorously rather than post chemotherapy effects of CHOP or RCHOP cycles leads to the fatal or life threatening renal and hepatic toxicities. As far as safety is concern RCHOP is safest than CHOP in term of toxicities. P-477 Parents' Lived Experiences of Losing a Child to Cancer; Like Being Covered in a Wet and Black Blanket M. Bjork 1, A. Sundler Johansson2, I. Hallstr\u00f6m3, K. Hammarlund4 1School of Health and Welfare, CHILD research group Department of Nursing J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping University, J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping, Sweden; 2Faculty of Caring Science, Work Life and Social Welfare University of Bor\u00e5s, Bor\u00e5s, Sweden; 3Faculty of Medicine, Department of Health Sciences Lund University, Lund, Sweden; 4Division of Nursing, Department of Health and Learning University of Sk\u00f6vde, Sk\u00f6vde, Sweden Background/Objectives: To elucidate parents' lived experiences of losing a child to cancer. Design/Methods: A hermeneutical phenomenological approach was chosen. Five parents were interviewed and one wrote down a narrative about the experiences of losing a child to cancer. Results: Through the analysis one essential theme was identified \"Like being covered in a wet and black blanket\". In relation to the essential theme, six related themes emerged \"Feeling conflicting emotions\", \"Trying to get ready for the moment of death, \"Parenting continues after death\", \"Keeping the spirit alive\", \"Working with the sorrow\" and \"Wanting to comprehend life into a new integrated whole\". Conclusions: Losing a child to cancer is one of the most painful situations a parent can live through. Life will forever be changed and the parents need to find ways to learn to live without the child. When giving palliative care to a child, the care needs to be holistic and focus both the child and its family. For staff, it is important to meet parents more than once after the child's death to be able to identify those in need for extensive support. P-478 Teamwork at EndofLife: Developing an Integrated Model S. Holm 1 1Children's Medical Center, Psychiatry, Dallas, USA Background/Objectives: (Abstract is part of a symposium submission: 'Psychosocial Care Models for End of Life and Bereavement Support.') Preparing for the death of a child is exceptionally distressing for the family. To provide best endoflife care, it's imperative that an institutional infrastructure exist to promote highly collaborative work. This project describes the development of an integrative interdisciplinary palliative care team within the oncology service at a large pediatric hospital and compares it to current standards of care. The purpose of the team was to improve quality of care for children at highest risk for death through cohesive assimilation of medical and psychosocial professionals already providing services in parallel. Design/Methods: Prior to developing this team, endoflife care followed a traditional multidisciplinary model: the oncologist focused on medical aspects of care and referred to subspecialties for other concerns. Collaboration amongst subspecialties was inconsistent, leading to conflicting interventions, contradictory goals of care, and moral distress. In response to these difficulties, a group of experts developed an interdisciplinary approach to supporting families through endoflife using an integrated care model. Results: An included case example to illustrates this integrated model of endoflife care: an adolescent girl with metastatic alveolar Rhabdomyosarcoma; a parent with untreated paranoid schizophrenia. This highly integrated approach led to several improved outcomes: improved communication meant frequent crises were managed adequately, streamlined care prevented repeated/competing interventions, increased interdependence of psychosocial team members allowed for focus on selfcare, and unified goals led to a peaceful death experience. Conclusions: The ultimate goal of palliative care is to identify and ameliorate suffering and at endoflife, this seems best achieved through the holistic care of a child and family by a wellintegrated team of specialists working toward consistent goals. Through developing this team, we learned that true interdisciplinary collaboration improved the experience of a child's death for the family and providers. P-479 Palliative Radiotherapy for Pediatric Patients: Outcome Expectations B. D. Apkon2, J. Wolfe1,3, K. Marcus1,2,3 1DanaFarber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Radiation Oncology, Boston, USA; 2Brigham and Women's Hospital, Radiation Oncology, Boston, 3Harvard Medical School, Radiation Oncology, Boston, USA Background/Objectives: Palliative radiation therapy (pRT) for pediatric cancer patients is often used to treat pain, neurologic symptoms, and other conditions from progressive cancer that affect quality of life. The decision to pursue additional anticancer therapy towards the end of their child's life may be a challenging one. The perceived risk versus benefit ratio may be altered depending on parental knowledge and expectations of pRT for their child. The goal of this study was to explore parental expectations of pRT and whether the outcome met their expectations. Design/Methods: Nineteen children referred for pRT were enrolled in a prospective IRBapproved study. At the time of initial consultation, parents were counseled regarding the indication for pRT and the expected outcomes of treatment. At one to three months following treatment completion, a questionnaire was given to parents to evaluate how the results of treatment compared to their initial expectations of pRT. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the results of the questionnaire. Results: Compared to their initial expectations for pRT, 56% reported that the outcome of pRT in their child was much better than expected. 33% reported slightly better results, 6% reported outcomes consistent with their expectations, and 7% reported that the results were slightly worse. No parents reported that the outcome was much worse than their expectations. Conclusions: Radiation therapy is an important modality in palliative care for children with endstage cancer. In this study, we found that the large majority of parents believed that the results of the pRT were better than expected. Our findings may be of value for future patients whose parents must make this difficult decision. P-480 End of Life Care Experience at the Pediatric Oncology Unit at the Uganda Cancer Institute: What Role Can Oncology Nurses Play? I. Mulyowa 1 1Uganda Cancer Institute, Oncology, Kampala, Uganda Background/Objectives: Although the majority of childhood cancers are curable, this is not yet true for low resource countries. In Uganda, cancer care is only at the Uganda Cancer Institute. Between Jan 1st and Dec 31st, there were 4,321 new cancer cases registered and about 8% were among children. The mortality rate is 70% annually, that is every 3 in 5 children diagnosed with cancer will not survive past one year after cancer diagnosis. Here, we review the factors contributing to poor outcomes and potential solutions. Design/Methods: Observation Results: Majority of the children present with advanced disease at cancer diagnosis. The chemotherapy is prescribed for palliative intent more frequently and high rates of complications are observed. Family involvement in decisions regarding the role of palliative chemotherapy at end of life is low. The concept of quality of life for cancer patients with advanced cancer is not well perceived among caretakers and some clinicians at UCI. Nurses play an integral role, identifying symptoms, providing care coordination, and assuring clear communication. Conclusions: Educational initiatives for patients, families and healthcare providers, are essential. The oncology nurses play a key role in the multidisciplinary team approach to paediatric patients at end of life care. P-481 Palliative Care: Educational Intervention for Nurses in Lebanon: An Attempt M. Naifeh Khoury 1, M. Arevian1, G. ElKhatib1, S. Fares1 1American University of Beirut, Hariri School of NUrsing, beyrouth, Lebanon Background/Objectives: Background: Palliative Care (PC), End -ofLife (EOL) care is evolving worldwide and in Lebanon. PC provides as good or better outcomes than curative care alone, is cost effective, and alleviates pain and suffering for patients and caregivers. Nursing educators and leaders, internationally and nationally indicate need to include concepts of \"PC\" and \" EOL\" care in curricula of professional nurses to cope with death and dying as potential outcome for patient. Purpose: Assess the effectiveness of PC continuing educational intervention for registered nurses (RNs) at American University Medical Center (AUBMC); recommend future educational programs. Design/Methods: Methods: Quasi experimental preposttest. Convenient \"RNs \"dealing with and \"ELO\" care Program: 0necredit workshop, basics in\" PC\" and \"ELO\" Care. Local \"PC\" experts provided the program. Content adapted from the Education for Physicians of End of Life Care Curriculum (EPEC). PrePost test consisted 34 multiple choice questions. Analysis: Demographic characteristics summarized using descriptive statistics. Differences between preposttests were measured by means and standard deviations (SD) using the paired t test. A twotailed test was used, pvalue less than 0.05 considered significant. Results: Results Thirty nine participants completed the preposttest: Mean pretest score was 48.53(SD = 9.23), range2965, post test 70.05 (SD = 12.35), range 4788. Paired t test showed significant increase between pre and post test scores t (38) = 11.07, p < 0.001 with 95% confidence interval for the mean difference of (17.58, 25.45). Conclusions: Conclusion: provide structured workshops to \"RNs\" to for improving \"PC\" and \"EOL\" Care. P-482 Implementation and Evaluation of a Pediatric Palliative Care Educational Program Intended for Nursing Staff of a National Reference Pediatric Hospital in Nicaragua R. Ortiz1, N. Diaz 1, S. Saleh2, C. Maendley3, M. Chamorro4, C. Salazar4 1Manuel de Pediatric Mascota Children's Hospital, Pediatrics, Managua, Nicaragua Background/Objectives: Pediatric Palliative Care (PPC) is unarguably essential in both Global North and South as it refers to universal Right to Health. Following the 2014 World Health Assembly's resolution on Palliative Care, Nicaragua launched in 2015 its first national Pediatric Palliative Care Program in collaboration with two NGO's Associazione per l'aiuto medico al Centro America and M\u00e9decins du Monde. Objectives include healthcare workforce training and essential drugs supply provision. Within this framework, a PPC educational program intended for nurses caring for children with life limitng diseases at the only national referral Children's Hospital in Managua was developed. Design/Methods: From November 2015 to December 2016, a trained nurse educator provided 8 educational basic courses on PPC to nurses of various departments of the pediatric hospital. Preintervention tests and 6month postintervention tests were administered to nurses to assess change in general PPC knowledge. The highest possible test score was 18 points. Comparison of mean results between pre and posttests was performed. Results: 54 nurses from 5 departments took part to the whole 8courses educational program. The mean pretest result was 10.45 points whereas mean posttest result was 14.60 points. A 4.15point difference was observed between pre and posttest assessment of knowledge of participants. Conclusions: Marked difference between pre and post assessment demonstrate positive impact of this educational program. Above all, a raised awareness regarding need for palliative care was witnessed across the hospital as the demand for consultations increased notably. Education of health care professionals is essential to sustainable, efficient and quality provision of PPC. These positive outcomes open the doors now for additional theoretical and practical training for nurses as well as targeting other health care professionals involved in the care of pediatric palliative care patients. Finally, there is a need to review tools used to evaluate educational interventions in the field of palliative care. P-483 EndofLife Care for Children with Cancer: Medical Practitioners' Training Needs Assessment in a Resource Poor Setting L. Oseitutu 1, E. Sarfo Frimpong2, V. Paintsil1, Kumasi, 2Komfo Teaching Hospital, Research and Development Unit, kumasi, Ghana Background/Objectives: The Paediatric Cancer Unit of the Child Health Department in the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital, KATH is one of two main childhood cancer treatment centers in Ghana. 113 new patients visited the Unit in 2016; 78(69%) required palliation and 39(34%) died. Most deaths, 33(84%) occurred in the hospital. We aimed to assess the endoflife training needs of medical practitioners in the Department in the setting of paediatric cancers Design/Methods: Medical practitioners completed a survey assessing their participation, communication skills and practices in endoflife care regarding paediatric cancer patients. Responses were ranked on fivepoint Likert scales and analysed by simple proportions Results: 30 practitioners, 20 doctors and 10 nurses completed the survey. All participants reported ever undertaking some endoflife care some endoflife responsibilities. 12(60%) doctors and 5(50%) nurses reported not receiving any such formal training. All doctors reported not receiving any formal instructions on having followup contact with families after patient deaths compared to 5(50%) of nurses surveyed. Most (80%) participants reported lacking formal instructions in seeking support for themselves regarding endoflife situations. 12(60%) doctors and 7(70%) nurses did not \"feel adequately trained to undertake withdrawal or limitation of lifesustaining therapy\" whereas only 9(18%) doctors and 4(40%) nurses \"felt adequately trained to provide symptom management at the end of life.\" 45-60% of participants reported adequate training and experience in communicating endoflife issues to families while 1530% reported feeling knowledgeable, competent and comfortable in such communications. 40% doctors compared to 50% nurses reported adequate training and experience in providing spiritual support for dying children and their families. Only 15% of participants surveyed felt competent and comfortable including children in discussions about preparing for death Conclusions: Formal training in endoflife care in the setting of paediatric cancers appears inadequate with significant gaps in communication skills, in withdrawing or limiting lifesustaining therapy and symptom management P-484 Palliative Care Practice in Pediatric Oncology: A Single Center Experience in France G. RevonRiviere Pediatric palliative care is a field of primary importance for improvement of quality of life of children with cancer. Our study aims to describe practice of palliative care in our institution by studying time from inclusion to death, treatments, length of hospitalization, location of death, use of community palliative services and symptoms in children dying of cancer. Design/Methods: This study is a retrospective, single center, chart review of every child treated in our institution and deceased between June 2014 and June 2016. Symptoms were assessed by chart examination three months before death. y. Results: 45 patients died of cancer in two years. 34 (75.5 %) have been discussed in palliative care staff and 25 (55 %) were actively treated by pediatric palliative care unit. Median duration of palliative phase was 4.3 months (range: 0.0329.80). 91 % of patients died in hospital. During that time, mean number of antineoplastic treatments was 1.8 per patient and 25 % were included in a clinical trial. Symptoms were in order of frequency: pain, fatigue, poor appetite and digestive disorders. Their prevalence was underestimated in medical charts. Conclusions: We report our palliative activity to allow improvement in practices and resource allocation. Availability of innovative treatment for palliative purpose is high. However, there is a great variability in duration of palliative care and use of palliative resources. Definition of a group of highrisk children requiring early initiation of palliative care as well as standardization of palliative care assessments and interventions are necessary. P-485 Consultation Team in Tertiary Hospital as a Pediatric Palliative Care Model in Developing Country- 5 Years Experience of a Single Institution in China J. Wang 1 1Shanghai Children's Medical Center, department of hematology/oncology, Shanghai, China Background/Objectives: To evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of palliative care consultation(PCC) team as a service model at an oncology unit in a pediatric tertiary hospital in China. Design/Methods: Our core palliative care consultation team consists of a pediatric oncologist, a pediatric oncology nurse and a social worker. Doctor is the leader of this interdisciplinary team who is responsible for a coordinated care plan development. Patients are referred to the team from other pediatric oncologists, and PCC team delivers palliative care services through outpatient clinic, consultation, 7*24 hours hotline and hospice room located in the observation ward. The team also provides teaching and support to the health care professionals. Results: A total of 50 patients and their families have been referred since 2012. The referral reasons were refractory pain (2 patients) and endoflife care (48 patients). Diagnoses included leukemia and solid tumor. 28 boys and 22 girls aged from 14 months to 17 years. Among those patients for endoflife care, 18 and 1 died at community hospital and oncology ward of our hospital separately. The role of PCC team for these cases was providing support to the local hospital and the colleagues at our oncology unit. Another 29 patients received the direct care of PCC team. 20 of them died at hospice room, and 9 died at home. The main symptoms during the last month were pain, anorexia, fatigue, dyspnea, fever, edema, infection, bleeding, depression, fear, anxiety and insomnia. The direct and indirect interventions of PCC team showed the positive impact on suffering relief and death preparation. Conclusions: The palliative care consultation team is closely attached and provides professional support to the conventional health care. It is wellfunctioning and cost saving. We conclude that this model may play an important role of pediatric palliative care in developing country where the medical resources are insufficient. Treatment and Care Psychosocial (PPO) P-486 Who Should Inform on Children Quality of Life in Paediatric Oncology? Systematic Review and MetaAnalysis of Agreement Between Respondents C. Abate 1,2, C. Laverdi\u00e8re2,3, M. Krajinovic2,3, D. Canada Background/Objectives: Quality of life (QOL) is an essential component of care for children with cancer and for young survivors and is often informed by parents or significant others. Assessing QOL reliably is difficult due to divergent child and parent ratings. A systematic review and metaanalysis was performed to synthesize the size of differences between child and parent ratings on QOL at all stages of the cancer and to identify moderators of the differences between ratings. Design/Methods: A systematic search of PubMed, PsycINFO, EMbase, CINALH and reference lists revealed pertinent articles published until December 2016. Eligibility criteria included QOL ratings of patients <19 years old during or after cancer treatment and at least one of their parents with a validated instrument. Two independent reviewers extracted data and conducted quality assessments with standardized tools, in line with PRISMA recommendations. Random effects metaanalyses compared selfassessed and parentassessed QOL across scores and subscores: overall, physical, psychosocial. We computed effect sizes with 95% confidence intervals. Additional analyses of differences between QOL ratings and cancer diagnosis, cancer trajectories, and instruments are underway. Results: Fortytwo articles were eligible out of a possible 1,139. Twentysix percent of studies recruited children during treatment, 29% after treatment and 45% included mixed samples. They describe 4,325 children and 4,485 parents who differ on age at diagnosis, time since diagnosis, cancer types and QOL measures. Median ICC for overall QOL was 0.58 (quartile range=0.480.72) and median Cohen's d was 0.23 (quartile range=0.140.44). Preliminary analyses yield a mean moderate effect size between child and parent ratings. Moderation studies indicated that differences are associated with child age, child gender, clinical history, and parental mood. Conclusions: Disagreements among children and their parents highlight the importance of gathering QOL assessments from multiple respondents to identify vulnerable patients. Future research should explain disagreements and develop new methods to interpret multiple reports. P-487 The Childhood Cancer Mobile APP A. Filander 1, U. Persson1, M. af Childrens Hospital Pediatric Oncology, Stockholm, Sweden Background/Objectives: A family in shock because their child is diagnosed with cancer need to learn to understand the disease and treatment, a prerequisite for them to feel confident in taking care of their child. Health care is legally obliged to provide adequate information during a time when it is extremely difficult to absorb. For many years families at the children's cancer unit got their own folder with information about childhood cancer, unit routines and instructions how to act if the child should exhibit acute symptoms. The problem, however, was to keep the information updated. The childhood cancer mobile APP was developed as a complement to the verbal information, to make it possible to get answers when the questions arise at home, to avoid mixed messages from healthcare staff and to help parents to inform other close persons. Design/Methods: A special group of various clinical professions was formed to work with the APP together with the hospitals' Innovation Centre and an enterprise platform. The text in the information folder was updated and context and wording discussed in frequent meetings. Feedback from patients and relatives was gathered through workshops, questionnaires and mail. Significant parts was translated into the four most common foreign languages: English, Spanish, Somali and Arabic, and processed in workshops for interpreters and parents. Results: The APP was soon used by the majority of families at the unit and is constantly developed. Conclusions: The childhood cancer APP meet a considerable need for parents, relatives and staff. It is crucial to take help from experts on platform construction. P-488 Bridging the Gap Between Treatment and End of Life for Pediatric Patients with Cancer S. Flowers 1, J. HansenMoore1, T. YoungSaleme1, C. Russell1, M. Gardner1 1Nationwide Children's Hospital, Pediatric Psychology, Columbus, USA Background/Objectives: This abstract is part of a symposium submission from APA/Division 54 Hematology/Oncology/BMT SIG entitled Psychosocial Care Models for End of Life and Bereavement Support Nationwide Children's Hospital is the largest children's hospital in the United States. Our Psychosocial Oncology Team developed a model of care to enhance care for dying children. It embodies a collaborative approach with integration of medical, psychosocial, and palliative services for comprehensive, coordinated, and integrated programing. This model assesses and treats emotional and symptom burden, facilitates communication, provides anticipatory guidance and support to patients/families, while facilitating staff communication and support. Design/Methods: Our program addresses specialized needs of dying children in a collaborative team approach. Patients are assessed and treated via a large comprehensive psychosocial team of providers. Anticipatory grief support is facilitated by relationships focused on continuity of care, medical decisionmaking, care conferences, and endoflife conversations. We assist with patient/family communication with familycentered rounds, advanced care planning, and legacy building. Palliative/Oncology Rounds, team huddles, documentation, and death notification protocols were developed to improve staff communication. Additionally, we provide support for staff following patient deaths through debriefings/remembrances. Results: In large programs with multiple providers, it is often challenging to know who is providing specific services, while ensuring that families are receiving needed care. By increasing communication between and within teams, we ensure support, enhance/streamline services, and delineate service provision. Conclusions: The Psychosocial Oncology Team at NCH has improved communication among medical, psychosocial, and palliative team members to enhance opportunities and provide support around a child's death. In a field with a high level of burnout and stress, open communication and support among team members can serve to enhance the wellbeing and service provided to patients, and also reduce staff distress. A comparison between our model and the Psychosocial Standards of Care related to palliative care and bereavement followup will be reviewed. P-489 Risk Factors and Reasons for Loss to FollowUp Among Families of Children with Lymphoma in Malawi C. Stanley 1, T. van der Gronde1, K. Westmoreland1, S. Ande1, A. Amuquandoh1, pediatric cancer in subSaharan Africa (SSA). A principal contributing factor to suboptimal outcomes is frequent loss to followup (LTFU). However, risk factors and reasons for LTFU among families of children with lymphoma in SSA are not clear. Our aim was to assess risk factors and reasons for LTFU among pediatric lymphoma patients in Malawi. Design/Methods: We conducted a mixed methods study among children <18 years old with newly diagnosed lymphoma, prospectively enrolled between 2013 and 2016 in Lilongwe, Malawi. All children received standardized diagnosis and treatment, and were followed for up to two years. LTFU was defined as failure to attend a prescribed chemotherapy visit within four weeks, or posttreatment visit within three months. Child, guardian, and household characteristics associated with LTFU were assessed using Cox models. Semistructured interviews were conducted with primary caregivers of children experiencing LTFU. Results: Seventytwo children were newly diagnosed with lymphoma, of whom 56 (78%) had Burkitt and 16 (22%) Hodgkin lymphoma. Fortynine (68%) were male, median age was 10.6 years (interquartile range [IQR] 7.9-13.0), and 26 (36%) were LTFU. Lack of guardian formal education and travel time 4 hours to clinic were independently associated with LTFU, with adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 3.8 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.58.9, p=0.005] and aHR 2.9 (95% CI 1.26.9, p=0.019), respectively. The most frequent reasons for LTFU mentioned by guardians were community influence, suboptimal clinic environment, logistical challenges, transport costs, treatment side effects and toxicities, loss of hope, alternative healers, and beliefs about cure. Conclusions: LTFU was driven more by guardian or household characteristics than child characteristics. These findings highlight families at risk for LTFU, and opportunities to improve retention in care for pediatric cancer patients in SSA. P-490 Psychosocial Care Models for End of Life and Bereavement Support J. Hoag 1, K. Bingen1 1Medical College of Wisconsin, Department of Pediatrics, Milwaukee, USA Background/Objectives: This proposed symposium represents collaboration amongst the Hematology/Oncology/Blood and Marrow Transplant (BMT) Special Interest Group of the Society of Pediatric Psychology, American Psychological Association. In 2015, the Standards for Psychosocial Care for Children with Cancer were published in a landmark special edition of Pediatric Blood & Cancer. Two standards dealt with palliative care and bereavement. While a minimum of care has been established, it remains unclear how institutions are using these guidelines within their existing infrastructure to improve or refine their practice model. Therefore, the objective of this symposium is to describe the psychosocial care models for end of life and bereavement support across three institutions of varying sizes, resources, and geographical diversity to aid in our understanding of current practices. Design/Methods: The proposed presentations reflect various approaches to collaborative care across disciplines at end of life to facilitate honest and respectful communication with patients and families, improve familycentered advance care planning, and assist with memory making. Presenters will also discuss bereavement followup in their institution for families, as well as staff. Results: Descriptive program data will be presented, including hospital and patient demographics, composition of palliative and bereavement teams, timing of introductions and interventions, and program evaluation. Barriers to implementation will be addressed. Conclusions: This symposium highlights that there are various ways to implement the standards for psychosocial care for providing end of life and bereavement care for children with cancer and their families. Authors of corresponding abstracts: Stacy Flowers, Jeffrey Karst, and Suzanne Holm P-491 Psychosocial Functioning and Risk Factors for Siblings of Children with Cancer: An Updated Systematic Review K. Long 1, V. Lehmann2, A. Carpenter3, C. Gerhardt2, A. Marsland4, M. Alderfer5,6 Psychological and Brain Sciences, Boston, USA; 2Nationwide Children's Hospital, Center for Biobehavioral Health, Columbus, USA; 3Boston University, Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, Boston, USA; 4University of Pittsburgh, Psychology, Pittsburgh, USA; 5Nemours Children's Health System, Center for Healthcare Delivery Science, Wilmington, USA; 6Thomas Jefferson University, Sidney Kimmel Medical College, Philadelphia, USA Background/Objectives: Despite increased research, our understanding of siblings' psychosocial adjustment to cancer remains limited. This updated systematic review summarizes main findings and limitations of the current sibling literature, provides clinical recommendations, and offers future research directions. Design/Methods: Searches of MEDLINE/Pubmed, CINAHL, and PsycINFO yielded 1731 articles published since 2008 related to siblings, psychosocial functioning, and pediatric cancer. Of these, 103 (64 quantitative, 35 qualitative, and four mixed methods) met inclusion criteria. They were rated for scientific merit, and findings were extracted and synthesized Results: While mean levels of anxiety, depression, and general adjustment (e.g., symptoms of internalizing, externalizing, or general distress) are similar across sibling and comparison samples, many siblings report moderate/severe levels of cancerrelated posttraumatic stress. Schoolaged siblings display poorer academic functioning and more absenteeism than peers; their peer relationships are similar to those of comparisons. Findings regarding quality of life are mixed. Adult siblings may have a higher risk for cardiovascular disease and engaging in risky or heavy drinking than comparisons. Risk factors for poor adjustment include low social support, poorer family functioning, lower income, nonwhite race, and shorter time since diagnosis, but findings are inconsistent. Qualitative studies report themes of siblings' maturity, compassion, and autonomy, along with strong negative emotions, uncertainty, family disruptions, limited parental support, school problems, altered friendships, and unmet needs. Conclusions are limited because longitudinal studies are lacking, siblings are often considered controls for patients/survivors, and sample characteristics (e.g., age, race/ethnicity, time since cancer diagnosis) are rarely considered. Conclusions: Despite methodological limitations, the literature indicates a strong need for sibling psychosocial care focused on identifying atrisk siblings, facilitating family communication about cancer, and bolstering siblings' social support, cancerrelated knowledge, and cancer involvement. Future research that implements longitudinal designs and focuses on mechanisms and moderators of siblings' adjustment would inform optimal timing and targets of siblings' psychosocial care. P-492 PostTraumatic Stress Symptoms and Family Risk Among Adolescents and Young Adults with Differentiated Thyroid Cancer: Prospective Psychosocial Screening of an Underserved Cancer Population A. Psihogios 1, J. Baran1, J. Pizza1, S. MostoufiMoab1, A. Bauer1, L. Barakat1 1The Hospital of Philadelphia, Pediatrics, Philadelphia, USA Background/Objectives: Approximately 25% of AYA with cancer report elevated posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). AYA with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) are often excluded from psychosocial research and clinical initiatives due to their good prognosis and treatment outside of cancer centers. To enhance understanding of adaptation, this study describes clinical rates of AYA and caregiver PTSS and family risk, and correlates with PTSS. with DTC (n=45, and (n=44, 70.2% mothers) completed questionnaires at diagnosis (T1) and 12 months later (T2), including the PTSD ChecklistCivilian 6 (PTSS), Psychosocial Assessment Tool (family risk), and PedsQL (HRQOL). We evaluated clinically significant rates of PTSS and family risk by assessing responses above established cut points. Multiple regressions and MANOVAs examined relationships between PTSS and correlates. Results: Among AYA, 23.8% and 11.1% reported clinically significant PTSS at T1 and T2. Among caregivers, 22.0% and 26.7% reported clinically significant PTSS, and 36.6% and 35.0% endorsed family risk associated with intervention needs at T1 and T2. Mean AYA HRQOL was 77.6 and 82.5 at T1 and T2. Paired ttests showed no significant changes in PTSS and family risk from T1 to T2. Lower HRQOL (=.72, p<.001) was associated with more AYA PTSS at T1, and AYA with at least one complication reported greater PTSS at T2 (F=5.29, p=.04). Higher family risk was T1 (=.40,p=.001) and T2 (=.81, to other childhood cancer samples, a subset of AYA with DTC and caregivers are atrisk for clinical levels of PTSS. The persistence of PTSS in the year postdiagnosis, combined with family risk, highlight the importance of conveying psychosocial screening to AYA treated in the endocrine setting. AYA HRQOL was similar to other newly diagnosed cancer patients at T1, and may be targeted to reduce PTSS. P-493 An Investigation of Parent and Child Sleep Patterns on an InPatient Oncology Unit B. Russell1, G. Narendran2, S. Lee3, L. Tomfohr1, F. Schulte 4 1University of Calgary, Psychology, Calgary, Canada; 2University of Calgary, Canada; Canada; 4University of Calgary, Oncology, Calgary, Canada Background/Objectives: Pediatric cancer patients and their parents often stay in hospital for extended periods of time and report disruptions in sleep. This study aims to examine objective and subjective measures of sleep quality in pediatric cancer patients and their parents, receiving overnight oncology care. Design/Methods: Sixteen patients (11 male; mean age=13.47 years) and 14 parents have participated. For three consecutive days, patients and parents each wore an actigraphy watch and completed a daily Sleep Diary. Patients also completed the Child Depression Inventory, Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children, Child Sleep Habits Questionnaire, Pediatric Quality of Life (PedsQL) Multidimensional Fatigue Scale, and PedsQL Generic Core. Parents additionally completed the State Trait Anxiety Inventory for Adults, Abbreviated Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Proxy PedsQL Mulidimensional Anxiety Scale, Proxy PedsQL Generic Core, and a daily Profile of Mood States Questionnaire. Results: Preliminary findings indicate that 80% of pediatric oncology patients selfreport symptoms of sleep disruption and/or fatigue based upon measures of Child Sleep Habits, Anxiety and Sleep Quality. Additionally, the PedsQL Multifatigue Scale indicated that all 16 children reported greater general, cognitive and sleep/rest fatigue in comparison to published norms. Conclusions: Data obtained from this research will help to identify ways to decrease the effects of an important physiological consequence of current cancer care practices. Research into sleep disturbances in hospitalized pediatric cancer patients and parents will aid in a better understanding of the developmental frameworks that guide intervention/prevention programs, providing benefit to and optimization of child and parent health during their hospital stay. P-494 Home Physical Activity Intervention to Improve Cognitive Late Effects in Children Treated with Radiation for Brain Tumors: Pilot Feasibility and Efficacy Data P. Wolters 1, B. Abel1, S. Martin1, K. Smith2, Institute, Pediatric Oncology Branch, Bethesda, USA; 2National Institutes of Health, Clinical Center, Bethesda, USA; 3Leidos Biomedical Research Inc, Clinical Research Directorate/Clinical Monitoring Research Program NCI Campus at Frederick, Frederick Maryland 21702, USA; 4National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, Diabetes Endocrinology and Obesity Branch, Bethesda, USA; 5Northeastern University, Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, Boston, USA; 6Cogstate Inc., Clinical Science, Melbourne, Australia; 7University of Tennessee Health Sciences Center, Department of Pediatrics, Memphis, USA Background/Objectives: Cranial radiation therapy (CRT) for pediatric brain tumors contributes to neurocognitive late effects. Cognitive rehabilitation interventions are sorely needed. Studies indicate that physical activity (PA) improves CRTdamaged brain mechanisms and cognitive functions. The aim of this pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) was to assess the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a novel home PA intervention in children treated with CRT for brain tumors. Design/Methods: Children 817 years, >two years postCRT, with cognitive late effects were randomized to the Immediate Intervention Group (IIG), which followed a 12week home program to increase PA then maintained PA for 12 weeks, or the Delayed Intervention Group (DIG), which monitored usual PA for 12 weeks followed by the 12week program. Psychologists taught Acceptance and Commitment Therapy techniques to facilitate PA engagement. Participants used accelerometers and a website to track and reward moderatetovigorous PA (MVPA). Both groups underwent fasting blood draws (to measure circulating growth factors), treadmill evaluations, and cognitive assessments before and after the first 12 weeks, and repeat cognitive assessments after the second 12 weeks, including Cogstate computerized tests (normative mean=100;SD=15). Participants repeated Cogstate tests immediately after treadmill evaluations. Results: All six children (mean age=13.8 years, 1017) enrolled (IIG=3;DIG=3) completed the pilot study. From baseline to during the 12week program, 6/6 increased weekly MVPA (total means 41 to 130 minutes). After the treadmill evaluations, 5/6 had improved Cogstate visual memory scores (total means 107 to 118). The IIG showed greater increase in visual memory scores postintervention compared to after the DIG 12week postcontrol period (14 versus 5 points). On 5point Likert scales, participants reported liking the program (mean=4) and finding it helpful (mean=4). Conclusions: These pilot data suggest feasibility of an innovative home PA intervention in children treated for brain tumors and provides preliminary evidence of increased MVPA and potential cognitive benefit to support a larger RCT. Treatment and Care Nursing P-495 Developing Resources on Positive Attitudes and a Sense of Purpose to Gain Resilience in Adolescents with Cancer I. Akiko 1, K. Kamibeppu1 1Graduate School of Health Sciences & Nursing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Tokyo Background: Adolescents with cancer (AWC) show the strengths of a positive attitude and sense of purpose. The resources refer to maintain peers, school life, social relationships, and a normal life. The purpose of this study was to develop the resources on the positive attitude and the purpose to gain resilience in the AWC. Methods: Yin's descriptive case study was used. The study was approved by the institutional review board. The semistructured interview guide was performed facetoface by an author in a private room. The cancer experience, coping strategies, hope, and social support in the 4 phases (the early inpatient, the inpatient, the near discharge, and the outpatient) were asked. The interview was lasted between 45 to 70 minutes. Results: The 9 participants comprised; 6 males and 3 females, 12 to 18 years old, and 1 to 17 months of being an outpatient. The interview data was classified in the resources on the positive attitude and the purpose in the 4 phases. The results were exhibited the graphical patterns in the newly diagnosed AWC and the other one. The average of the patterns was shown in the temporal patterns. The wave of the positive attitude was higher than it of the purpose. The positive attitude encountered the gently wave path with low, up, and down between the 4 phases. The purpose was the steep one with up between in the inpatient and the near discharge. The resources were found that the parent(s) and the friends were used more than the others. The parent(s) worked more in the early inpatient phase and the friends did more after the phase. Conclusions: The AWC used the resources depends on the phases. They had fewer resources to make the purpose. The some interventions may need them to make the purpose and to improve the resilience. Keywords: adolescents with cancer, resilience, resources, positive attitudes, a sense of purpose P-496 Technology Solutions to Promote Medication Adherence: Perceptions of Parents of Childhood Cancer Patients C. Baggott Do not use 1 1Stanford University, Cancer Clinical Trials Office, Palo Alto, USA Background/Objectives: Children with cancer require complex home medication regimens, typically facilitated by their parents. Despite the critical nature of these drugs, nonadherence to these regimens is commonplace, related to intentional factors (e.g., avoidance of toxic effects) or unintentional factors (e.g., forgetfulness, medication errors). Medication nonadherence has been linked to poor outcomes among children with cancer. A thorough and accurate assessment of patients' medication use is essential. When collected in realtime, these data can: promote early detection of untoward symptom patterns; identify patient/family misconceptions of medication regimen details; identify patients/families who struggle with medication adherence; and provide required data for. clinical trials. The current practice of interviewing parents to elicit drug use over the prior weeks is time consuming and prone to recall errors. Furthermore, this practice does not provide feedback on medication use patterns. While numerous technology solutions (e.g., smartphones, smartwatches, electronic pillboxes) are available to promote medication adherence, their efficacy has not been evaluated. In a sample of parents of childhood cancer patients, the primary objective of this project is to determine the challenges in existing medication administration/recording practices and the optimal features to include in technology solutions for medication tracking. Design/Methods: Parents of children who are receiving chemotherapy for cancer will participate in semistructured interviews to elicit their perceptions of challenges in medication adherence and their views on technology available and potential technology solutions to facilitate medication tracking and promote adherence to medication regimens. The sample will consist of 15 mothers or fathers whose children have received chemotherapy for at least 6 months and remain on treatment at the time of the interview. Results: Results will be summarized in poster format. Conclusions: Eliciting views of challenges and solutions for medication tracking from parents of childhood cancer patients may inform strategies to promote successful adoption of technology solutions to promote medication adherence. P-497 Paying it Forward: The Shared Knowledge of Pediatric Nursing Care from the United States to the West Bank Palestine and Beyond J. Bartholomew 1, M. Freha2 1Children's Mercy Hospital, Hematology/Oncology, Kansas City, USA; 2Huda Al Masri, Pediatric Oncology, Beit Jala, Palestinian Authority Background/Objectives: Due to political and economic forces, children with cancer in Palestine had essentially no access to care. In 2013, the vision to develop a regional pediatric oncology center became a reality. A collaborative effort to maximize the care available to these children was established between Kansas City (KC), United States and Beit Jala (BJ), Palestinian Territory. Design/Methods: A series of training sessions by nurses from KC were provided. Initially nursing education focused on the oncologic diseases that were anticipated to be seen and the emergent care that would be needed. As the center in BJ developed, nursing education progressed to infection control, safe handling of agents and patient supportive care. The focus most recently has shifted to the development of nursing policies and procedures to provide consistent care and in the strengthening of interdisciplinary communication. A questionnaire was provided to the nurses at Huda Al Masri Pediatric Cancer Department to assess nursing care and level of comfort both prior to and post the educational sessions related to: Chemotherapy safety Supportive care Patient/family education Consistency of care Team communication Results: The questionnaire clearly demonstrated the confidence in nursing care that has developed through the educational interventions provided by KC. Nurses at Huda Al Masri acknowledge the ability to safely provide care, educate the patients and families on the diagnosis and treatment side effects and advocate for their patients in a receptive team environment Conclusions: Knowledge gained regarding oncologic diagnoses, processes, treatments and emergency management has increased nursing ability to confidently provide quality care. The success of this BJ program is now being replicated in Gaza. P-498 Care Plan for Mucositis in Thalassemia Patients after Haploidenticalhematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation J. Chanapai 1, P. Aimsirirak1, S. Suksalee1, P. Oncology, Bangkok, Background/Objectives: Mucositis is a common complication in patient' underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Mucositis is graded from mild sympyoms to severe pain and unable to eat causing nutritional insufficiency. Care plan for mucositis may help to relief patients' suffering and improve their nutrition status. Objective: To develop care plan for mucositis in thalassemic patients heploidentical Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation(HSCT) Methods; We retrospectively analyzed frequency and severity of mucositis in patients with Thalassemia after haploidentical Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation(HSCT) and developed care plan using the collected data of mucositis. Results: There were 18 severe beta thalassemic patients,with a median age of 7.3 years (range 2.127 years), receiving hematopoietic stem cells from mothers or fathers at our insttute between January 2015 and December 2016. The preparative regimen included rabbit antithymocyte globulin, fludarabine and intravenous busulfan. All of patients developed mucositis with severity of grade3 (n=8) and grade 4 (n =10). We recorded mucositis grading everyday and found that patient suffered withmucositis during the first 2 weeks after HSCT. Grade 1 occurred between day +2 and +4, grade 2 between day +2 and +6, grade 3 between day +6 and +12 and grade 4 between day +8 and +16. Using this data, we have planned for our nursing care as(1) evaluating nutrition intake and support since day +1, (2) changing oral is intravenous medications since day +6, (3) considering parenteral nutrition since day +6,(4) weaning parenteral support and encouraging oral intake since day +16. As a result, the median length of stay was only 22 days. Conclusions: Using data of mucositis,We successfully developed and used our care plan for mucositis in Thalassemia patients undergoing Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation(HSCT). P-499 Prevention of Severe IncontinenceAssociated Dermatitis in Pediatric Patients Undergoing Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant K. Coish 1, K. Ridgway1, B. patteson1, A. mahoney1, E. Postell1, S. malone1 1Children's Health System, Heme/Onc/HSCT unit, Washington DC, USA Background/Objectives: Hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT) registered nurses in our institution noted an increased incidence of severe incontinenceassociated dermatitis (IAD), defined by for HSCT induce prolonged neutropenia, increased risk of infection, and delayed wound healing, increasing the risk of skin breakdown. This preventable complication causes increased pain, costs, and length of stay. Design/Methods: Cyanoacrylate liquid skin barrier has been used with positive outcomes to treat and expedite healing of IAD. Through an interdisciplinary quality improvement (QI) project, our HSCT team implemented prophylactic use of cyanoacrylate on incontinent patients undergoing HSCT. Patients who met eligibility and consented began prophylactic perianal cyanoacrylate use upon admission for their myeloablative preparatory regimen. Use of cyanoacrylate continued through engraftment. Incontinent patients receiving thiotepa were excluded until adhesive products were permissible. Skin and Wound Team members provided education to staff and caregivers on application of cyanoacrylate. Providers added cyanoacrylate application to orders on eligible and consenting HSCT patients. Results: Sixty seven percent of patients who met criteria participated in the preventative application of cyanoacrylate to the perianal area. No perianal breakdown was observed on these four patients during their HSCT admission. The remaining two patients (33%), who did not to consent to cyanoacrylate, experienced severe IAD necessitating wound consultation and intravenous pain medication. One patient developed incontinence after admission, prompting immediate implementation of preventative cyanoacrylate. This patient did not develop IAD. Conclusions: The use of cyanoacrylate in vulnerable pediatric patients can prevent lifethreatening infection due to skin breakdown. This succesful quality initiative is innovative and costeffective. This project can be expanded to meet the needs of other incontinent patients at risk for severe IAD. P-500 Improving Patient Care for Hispanic Pediatric Oncology Patients with Limited English Proficiency T. Flatt1, T. Torres 1 1Children's Mercy Hospital, Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Kansas City, USA Background/Objectives: Caregivers of pediatric oncology patients with limited English proficiency face challenges as they navigate the English speaking medical system in the US. Our objective is to present bilingual materials that have improved patient care and compliance. Design/Methods: This is a description of materials that have been successfully utilized to improve patient care services and medical compliance for Hispanic caregivers with limited English proficiency. The materials will be demonstrated in the poster. Results: Bilingual patient face sheets that include cancer diagnosis, central line details, oncology contact information and strict instructions regarding time to collect blood cultures and initiate antibiotics for patients with cancer are provided to caregivers for medical visits outside of our facility. Many patients live long distance from our main hospital with no onsite language interpreter and this tool has decreased triage time and shortened time to obtain antibiotics for patients with fever and neutropenia. Bilingual medication calendars and medication lists have improved compliance including adherence to oral chemotherapy. A bilingual oncology essentials entailing side effects to monitor at home and parameters for when to contact provider services. The use of bilingual pill boxes (made by our medical team) have proven instrumental in medication adherence in complicated experimental therapeutic protocols that do not permit deviation from the protocol. Conclusions: Appropriate bilingual materials can improve patient care access, decrease triage times, time to antibiotic administration and improve medication compliance. P-501 Role of Nursing Care in the Management of Burkitt's Lymphoma Patient During Inpatient Stay after First Cycle of Intense Chemotherapy Copadm Post Complications R.N. Gill 1, H. Khan1, N. Patrus1, A.N. Gill1 1Shaukat Memorial Pediatric Oncology/Hematology Inpatient department, Lahore, Pakistan Background/Objectives: This Study permits us to know the nursing care convention gave by nurses at Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Center to the patient with Burkitt lymphoma got first cycle of COPADM. Nurses are challenged by the complexity of the therapy regimen & the management of acute and long term effects & toxicities. Nursing care include symptoms management,encouragement and support to the patients during hospital stay Design/Methods: We retrospectively investigated nursing notes of 30 patient of Burkitt's lymphoma patients received first cycle COPADM at Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Center during the year December 2016 to Jan 2017. Information including age, sex, financial status & duration of hospital stay. Common issues experienced were completely examined. Nurse's notes were evaluated in regards to motivational and dietary advising. Results: 30 patients reviewed 28 were male. Median age of diagnosis was 14 years. All of these patients were admitted though EAR after 57 days of post COPADM. During hospital stay, Nurse to patient proportion was 1:6. Span of Hospital stay was 1014 days. Symptoms persisting for 7 days or more included Oral Mucositis (56%), Nausea (46%), Diarrhea (29%), fever (25%). Oral intake was decreased in 62% (n=19) primary contributing element was oral mucositis (n=18), nausea vomiting (n=14) abdominal discomfort (n=8) and disliking the food (n=6). Persistent nursing care including regular oral care and counseling for dietary improvement. 62% patients (n=19) were encountered by psychological disturbance, eminent reasons were social separation, home sickness, fear of disease progression & long term toxicities of chemotherapy. Frequent counseling session by attending nurses were conducted with active listening, employing play therapy (n=12), provision of Cartoon Movies (n=19) & story books (n=10) Conclusions: Individual assessment and dedicated efforts by nursing staff can facilitate these patients to cope with the problems encountered after receiving first cycle of intense chemotherapy COPADM. P-502 The Feasibility of a Tool to Systematically Evaluate Nursing Care Needs of Children with Cancer and Utilization of Nursing Resources H. Hansson 1, G. Petersen1, M. Madsen1, Department, Copenhagen, Denmark Background/Objectives: As a result of more intensive and complex treatment regimens, our patients have increasing multifaceted needs for nursing care. We developed a tool called PIMI to systematically document and measure nursing care needs of children with cancer and the use of nursing resources. The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of the tool and the balance between nursing care needs and the amount of nursing resources the needs demand. Design/Methods: PIMI is recorded daily and comprises two parts: 1) a classification in which the patient's needs for nursing care are evaluated and placed in one of six care categories, which refers to an optimal number of nurses needed to meet the patient's needs, and 2) a comparison of the optimal number of nurses with the actual number of nurses available. The interrater reliability was studied and it will be statistically validated in 2017. Data were collected for 179 days at our pediatric hematology oncology ward with 21inpatient beds between February and December 2016 and were analyzed with descriptive statistics. Results: The ward had 150 days (84%) below the optimal nursing staffing, 3 days on the optimal level, and 26 days (14%) above the level. The daily average was: 17 inpatient children (range 923), the optimal number of nurses needed: 10 (range 516), the actual number of nurses in nursing care: 8 (range 511), and number of nurses in nursing care with < 1 year of experience: 2 (range 06). Conclusions: PIMI is easy and accurate to use. The results document that the children's needs for nursing care do not match with the actual staffing level. PIMI can be used to the daily allocation of nurses based on the children's nursing care needs, and to manage nursing resources most appropriate in the longterm. P-503 A MetaAnalysis and Systematic Review of the Effect of LowLevel Laser Therapy in Pediatric ChemotherapyInduced Oral Mucositis M. He 1, N. Shen2, J. Children's Medical Center, Nursing Department, Shanghai, China Background/Objectives: Background Oral mucositis is one of the most frequent complications after chemotherapy, occurring in approximately 52% to 80% of children receiving treatment for cancer. Recently, it has been suggested that the use of lowenergy laser could reduce the grade of oral mucositis and alleviate the symptoms. Most of recommendations were made for adult patients, not pediatric patients. Data about effect of lowlevel laser therapy in pediatric patients is limited. Objective To synthesize the available clinical evidences on the effects of lowlevel laser therapy (LLLT) in the prevention and treatment of chemotherapyinduced oral mucositis (OM). Design/Methods: A metaanalysis was performed using trials identified through Pubmed (1966 to March 2017), EMbase (1980 to March 2017), Cochrane Library (up to 2016), CNKI (in Chinese, 1980 to March 2017). Data on occurrence, duration and severity of oral mucositis were collected. All randomized controlled studies and clinical controlled studies comparing LLLT to routine qualified prevention or treatment during or after chemotherapy were critically appraised and analyzed. Results: We found 5 qualified clinical trials with a total of 295 pediatric patients; methodological quality was acceptable. After metaanalysis, there was a significant preventive effect of LLLT with a relative risk at 0.34 (95% CI, 0.12 to 0.99) for grade II or higher OM to occur, but no significant preventive effects with a relative risk at 0.82 (95% CI, 0.60 to 1.11) for all OM to occur. After prophylactic LLLT, the OM severity could decrease significantly, with combined effect size 0.54 (95% CI, 1.87,0.03). No metaanalysis could be done with the effect of LLLT on treatment of OM Conclusions: Recommendation could be made to support LLLT on prevention of OM in pediatric patients. Effect of LLLT on treatment of OM could be promising, to decrease pain and duration. Future research should identify the proper characteristics of LLLT and determine feasibility in the clinical setting. P-504 Developing Resources to Gain Resilience in Adolescents with Cancer K. Kamibeppu 1 1Graduate School of Health Sciences & Nursing Faculty of Medicine The University of Tokyo, Department of Family Nursing, Tokyo, Japan Background/Objectives: Positive health is defined as developing strengths and resources to gain resilience. The resources refere to maintaining peers, school life, social relationships, and a normal life. The purpose of this study was to develop the resources to gain the positive attitude and the purpose (resilience) in adolescents with cancer (AWC). Design/Methods: Yin's descriptive case study was used. The data were analyzed with the patternmatching logic. This study was approved by the institutional review board. The physicians identified potential participants from their appointment list. The semistructured interview guide and Social Network Map were used to assess. The tools were performed facetoface by an author in a private room and lasted between 45 to 90 minutes and occurred while the participants were waiting for the results of a blood test. The interview proceeded from a broad and safe question to a specific and sensitive one. The participants were asked about the cancer experience, positive coping, hope and social support. The same researcher conducted the all interviews. The demographic and the health information were obtained form the patient charts. Results: The 9 participants comprised 6 malls and 3 females. Five of them were newly diagnosed, and 4 had experienced relapse. the ages pf the newly diagnosed participants reed from 13 to 17 years, and the participants who had relapsed were aged between 12 and 17 years. Conclusions: The positive attitude and the purpose were related to the resources. P-505 The Scope of Practice for Advanced Practice Nurses Working with Short Term Global Health Programs P. Johnson 1 1Children's Mercy Hospital, Hematology/Oncology, Kansas City, USA Background/Objectives: Advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) are an essential part of the US health care system and many seek to volunteer for short term global health programs to further expand their worldviews and provide care to marginalized populations. The International Council of Nurses (ICN) created a Scope of Practice and a Code of Ethics to be followed for APRNs practicing internationally, however this is not widely known. In addition, many countries do not fully recognize the APRN role and what healthcare services they can or cannot provide. Design/Methods: The purpose of the project was to explore APRNs perceptions of their scope of practice and current international standards of practice. A 21 item Survey Monkey\u00a9 in 2016, was conducted among members of the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners International Special Interest group who had participated in international short term global health programs. Participants were asked about scope of practice used with international practice, awareness of practice guidelines and ethical dilemmas encountered regarding scope of practice. Results: Nineteen respondents qualified for the survey. Half were family nurse practitioners and had participated in five or more trips internationally. Over 50% believed they were recognized as an APRN but many of the countries listed do not recognize APRNs. Over 60% followed their US scope of practice. Some expressed concerns about the number of patients to be seen with limited resources but 90% expressed a love of the work did not feel ethically challenged. Ethics of practice ranged from national guidelines to personal beliefs. Conclusions: As APRNs participate more in short term global health programs, mindfulness of the host and country expectations regarding scope of practice and national recognition of their role. Continued discussion of international roles of APRNs will help increase access to vulnerable populations and reduce stress to the providers. P-506 A Case Study Approach to Understanding the Value of Blogging for Social Support in Parents of Children Who Have Completed CancerDirected Treatment M. Killela 1, S. Santacroce2 1University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Nursing, Raleigh, USA; 2University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Nursing, Chapel Hill, USA Background/Objectives: Completion of cancerdirected treatment contains a very stressful transition for children with cancer and their families. The stress associated with this time period is amplified when the social supports that are associated with regular hospitalizations and outpatient visits are less frequent and thus a gap in the social network of families is created. The use of social media presents a possible source of support to fill this gap. This exploratory study aims to qualify the types of support evident in one family's publicly available online blog detailing their experiences in the period following completion of cancerdirected treatment. Design/Methods: By implementing Schaefer's theory of social support, which differentiates among emotional support, information support, and tangible support (1981), this paper used directed content analysis to scrutinize blog posts written in the sixmonths following cancerdirected treatment completion and to sort the content by social support domain. Results: The most common form of social support observed was information support in two categories: information about medical procedures and information about family life. The second most common form of social support was emotional support, which was divided into expression of fear and stress associated with both disease recurrence and the quest to achieve a new normal. Lastly, the third form of social support, tangible support, was the least common and expressed mostly in terms of gratitude for such support. Conclusions: This paper serves to provide information necessary for future studies in developing a nursing intervention to widely distribute blogging as a means of improving social support among parents and caregivers of children who have completed cancerdirected treatment. P-507 A Study on Preparation Utilizing a Picture Book at Hospitalization: for Patients of 310 Years Old N. Nakagaki 1 1Wayo Women's University, Nursing, Ichikawa, Japan Background/Objectives: The purpose of this study is to make clear how preparation utilizing a picture book influenced the children's coping ability when being admitted to a hospital. Design/Methods: The subjects of this study were eight children of 310 years old with leukaemia. During the children's hospitalization, nurses explained children the necessity of their hospitalization, visiting hour, hospital life and various staff using a picture book. Time of the explanation was 2030 minutes. They were hospitalized for the first time in a C ward for a hospitalization period of 37 days. Data was collected on the 1st day, the 2nd day and the last day of the hospitalization by means of participation observational method. The children's reactions toward hospitalization were observed. We analyzed and coded the children's reaction focusing on the state of their hospital life. The coded results were classified to subcategories, categories and then core categories. Results: The derived 7 core categories are as follows: [Children made up their mind to be staying in the hospital by joining preparation during hospitalization.] [They made an effort in order to get over loneliness staying away from their family.] [They could spend their hospital life depending on nurses.] [They spent the hospitalization with the relaxed feelings] [They had positive feelings toward the hospital life] [They could positively receive medical practice.] [They persevered in the hospitalization and had the feeling of achievement.] Conclusions: Children became able to imagine a hospitalization life somehow because they received preparation with their family's cooperation. Children were able to communicate with a nurse by sharing a picture book in preparation for hospitalization. Therefore children could build mutual trust relationship with a nurse and entrust a nurse with their hospital life. We consider children can evade prospective critical situation in hospitalization by receiving preparation utilizing a picture book. P-508 The Actual Situation of Preventive Measures Against Exposure to Anticancer Drugs in Japan J. Ogawa 1, M. Kudo2, M. Baba3, T. Watanabe4, Japan; 4Chiba University Hospital, Nursing, Chiba, Japan Background/Objectives: A guideline on preventing occupational exposure to anticancer drugs was published in 2016 in Japan. It is, however, insufficient to cover the pediatric oncology area. This study aimed to find the perception of occupational exposure among pediatric oncology nurses. Design/Methods: The original questionnaires about the preventing occupational exposure were mailed to nurses working for 104 hospitals (3 nurses from each hospital) where cancer children were treated. Results: Got 107 nurses (34.3%) responded including 86 nurses (80%) who reported they have hospital rules for occupational exposure. And found 78 nurses (73%) take some preventing measures for disposal of child excreta and 60 nurses of them educate family caregivers of children about preventing exposure. Eightyseven nurses (81%) take preventing measures for handling linen contaminated with excreta, while only 38 nurses (36%) explain about doing the laundry or taking laundry home to families. Specific exposure measures concerning the handling of excreta and linen were various, such as wearing only gloves and using some of personal protective equipment. Fiftyfive nurses (51%) clean children at the time of diaper changing. 19 nurses (18%) apply ointment for protecting themselves from exposure before administrating anticancer drug to children. Seventyseven nurses (71%) responded that they put on gloves for protection at the time of oral anticancer drug administration, and 64 nurses (60%) explain family caregivers about its importance. 55 nurses(51%) take preventing measures for handling empty bags of oral anticancer drugs. Conclusions: It's clear that preventing exposure to anticancer drugs for medical staff in pediatric oncology ward is not sufficient and need for guidelines specialized in childhood cancer treatment because patient's siblings or mother who gets pregnant are much more vulnerable than ordinal adults. P-509 The Introduction and Collaboration of Pharmacy Technicians to the Drug Adminsitration Process with Nurses Increases Saftety and Releases Time to Care H. Petts 1 1Birmingham Childrens Hospital, Haematology/ Oncology, Birmingham, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: The complexity, number and cost of medications within oncology has continued to rise. Nurses in a busy 27 bedded Principal Treatment Centre were reporting they were spending less time with patients at the bedside and more time in the drug preparation rooms. Families commented they always knew where to find a nurse; in the drug preparation room. This was compounded by the Trust's drug administration policy required 2 trained staff for the whole process. The project sought to explore the possibility of pharmacy technicians being part of this traditional nurse's role (from preparation of a drug trolley and medicines through to the documentation of the administration being complete) thus releasing nurse's time to care in a health economy where paediatric nurse recruitment was challenged. Further objectives were to improve timely delivery of medicines; reducing avoidable medicines waste and integrate the pharmacy role into the paediatric oncology ward team;ncreasing efficiency. Design/Methods: Initial observational studies were undertaken to identify the busiest time of day for intravenous and oral drug administration.This time was used to focus the initial intervention with the aim of maximum impact. A training package was disseminated for the technicians and checklists introduced based on monographs. Results: Each oral drug round undertaken by the nurse + pharmacy technician has reduced from an average of taking 61minutes to 41 minutes releasing time for \"nurses to care\". Additionally there was a reduction of 13 medication/ prescribing errors/ near miss incidents per day. Conclusions: The pharmacy technician - nurse combination to oral and intravenous medication administration has improved the patient / staff experience and released nurse's time. There continues to be a high incident reporting culture within the clinical area but the overall associated harm level has reduced and a proactive protocol driven approach to safety of medications has been embedded. P-510 Symptom Patterns in Children Recovering from Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant C. Rodgers 1, M. Highberger2, K. Voigt2, K. Powers3 1Duke University, School of Nursing, USA; 2Baylor College of Medicine, Pediatrics, Houston, USA; 3Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital, Stem Cell Transplant, Chicago, USA Background/Objectives: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) causes frequent and distressing symptoms that continue through the first 100 days post HSCT, known as the acute recovery phase. Current HSCT symptom research focuses on symptom prevalence at specific points in time with little evidence regarding the complexity of symptoms and their changes over time. The primary aim of the study is to identify symptom trajectory patterns among adolescents during acute HSCT recovery. Design/Methods: A repeated measures design was used to elicit symptoms experiences from 55 adolescents, age 1019 years, who received an allogeneic HSCT. After signed consent/assent, demographic information was obtained from the medical record and adolescents completed the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS) prior to HSCT. Adolescents completed the MSAS again at one, two, and three months post HSCT. Results: Data collection will be completed in June. Symptom trajectories will include symptom frequency, severity, and distress and evaluations will occur separately for these three symptom characteristics. Descriptive statistics and standard linear regressions will be used to examine the data over time. Conclusions: Findings from this study will allow healthcare providers to easily recognize and even anticipate their patients' symptoms during acute HSCT recovery. These providers can have meaningful symptom discussions with their patients to provide anticipatory guidance and promote strategies that can best help patients manage their symptoms. This study was funded by Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation. P-511 Feasibility of Measuring CarotidFemoral Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV) During Clinical Visits to Estimate Risk for Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) in New Survivors of Childhood Cancer S. Santacroce 1, J. Crandell1, J. Bai2, J. Blatt3, S. Gold3 1The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, School of Nursing and Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, Chapel Hill, USA; 2Emory University, Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing, Atlanta, USA; 3The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, School of Medicine and Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, Chapel Hill, USA Background/Objectives: Carotidfemoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) is an accurate noninvasive means to estimate arterial stiffness and thus risk for CVD in adults. The study purpose was to examine feasibility of measuring PWV during clinical visits to estimate risk for CVD in children who recently completed cancer therapy and relate PWV measurements to reference values. Design/Methods: Included: children aged 819 years and 14 months post treatment with treatment regimen that incorporated anthracyclines. Excluded: children with history of another medical condition (e.g., diabetes) known to heighten risk for CVD. A SphygmoCor Px device (Atcor, Sydney Australia) interfaced with a laptop computer was used to conduct PWV measurements. Trained professionals performed anthropometric measurements (e.g., weight, height, blood pressure, surface distance carotid site to jugular notch and jugular notch to femoral site) and entered them into the laptop for PWV calculation. PWV measurements were discarded and repeated if heart rate varied >10% between carotid and femoral site captures. Results: Most of the 23 participants were male (52%), white (82%), and nonHispanic (74%) with mean age of 12.26 \u00b13.16 years and mean time since treatment 2.30 \u00b11.06 months. The device tonometry probe failed during preparations in clinic for the first data collection. We had a second probe on hand and experienced no further technical issues. All participants lay quietly on an exam table and otherwise cooperated with PWV measurements. Femoral site captures were challenging but achieved for the 5 participants (22%) with body mass index (BMI) zscores >2. Plots compare PWV measurements to reference values for healthy children by sex and age, and show associations between PWV and BMI zscores. Conclusions: Measurement of PWV during clinical visits for children who recently completed cancer therapy is feasible. PWV measurements have potential to both inform and evaluate precision interventions to control risk for CVD in new survivors of childhood cancer. P-512 Establishment of A Guideline to Facillitate Adjustment on School Reentry for Children with Cancer in Japan G. Sayaka 1,2, S. Hitoshi1, M. Kimikazu3 1Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Department of Child Health Nursing, miyagi, Japan; 2National Center for Child Health and Development, Nursing Department, tokyo, Japan; 3National Center for Child Health and Development, Children's Cancer Center, tokyo, Japan Background/Objectives: Children and adolescents with cancer face the difficulty to return to schools after completion of the therapy. There is no standard guideline for supporting to school reentry for children with cancer in Japan.In this study, we aim to develop a guideline for assessing the support of school reentry for children with cancer, providing equality in this situation in Japan. Design/Methods: First, we identified 39 papers from an online literature retrieval system of past 10 years using search words such as \"childhood cancer,\" \"chronic disease,\" and \"school reentry\", and collected fundamental information to establish a guideline. Five experts in medical care or educational research on children with cancer evaluated those papers using the Delphi method. Subsequently, a semistructured interview was conducted with 6 clinical nurses who specialize in pediatric cancer care, to confirm the validity of the guideline. Results: Although the supporting program of school reentry provided by hospitals in Japan varied, the basic elements were common. In addition to scheduling of the conference, and preparing requesting letters, we find it very important to affirm consensus between patients and their parents in the individual reentry plan. The conference should be held with doctors and nurses in charge, class teachers and supervisors, and patient and parents soon after the completion of initial treatment and at two to four weeks before discharge. The points to be addressed in the meeting included the information of disease to the concerned people at school, and methods to facilitate adjustment to classmates, those concerned with schools, and the healthcare personnel involved. Conclusions: A guideline will provide concrete methods of school reentry for children with cancer to patients, parents, medical staffs, and educators, which will lead to fulfilling support for pediatric cancer patients. P-513 Working for the Child\u00b4S Best by Creating a Sheltered Place During Chemotherapy for Paediatric Leukaemia C. Sj\u00f6berg of health and Welfare, Halmstad, Sweden Background/Objectives: Leukaemia is the most common cancer form for children worldwide. The disease encroaches on the child's daily life and influence on their living conditions and lifestyle. In addition to the disease itself, the treatment is an unpleasant experience that can cause pain, nausea and suffering. During treatment, the children stays at the hospital for long and frequent periods, which has a significant effect on their everyday life. Improvement and increased quality of care for children throughout their cancer trajectory is important and could lead to a better experience for children and reduced suffering related to the treatment.The objective was to explore the caring environment in accordance to sedation for chemotherapy in paediatric leukemia. Design/Methods: The study followed the approach of grounded theory and were based on interviews with practitioners involved in the paediatric oncology care process such concern that emerged was \"creating a sheltering place\", which means that all healthcare professionals works for the child\u00b4s best by providing sedation for chemotherapy at the children\u00b4s department instead of the operation theatre. The sheltering place consists of a familiar place, nearby the child\u00b4s hospital bed. The sheltering place creates an atmosphere that is embracing, calm and protects the child from the outside world. By reducing environmental difficulties and dedramatizing the event the sheltering place provides a temporary opportunity to feel safe and protected, which decreases the child\u00b4s anxiety and fear, and adapts the situation to the children\u00b4s needs. In doing so, the sheltering place minimizes the interference of the caring process on the child\u00b4s daily life. Conclusions: Working for the child\u00b4s best by creating a sheltering place during sedation for chemotherapy promotes adoption of a childcentred approach. P-514 How Hospital Environment Influences Children's Cancer Nursing in Japan M. Uchida 1, S. Takeuchi1, F. Shirai2, Y. Ohara3, J. Ogawa7, M. of Nursing, School of Nursing, Komagane, Japan; 2Nagano College of Nursing, School ob Nursing, Hospital, Department of Nursing, Chiba, Japan; 4Kanagawa Children's Medical Center, Department of Maternal & Child Health, Yokohama, Japan; 5St. Luke's International Hospital, Department of Nursing, tokyo, Japan; 6Kanagawa University of Human Service, Child Health Nursing, Yokosuka, Japan; 7Shukutoku University, School of Nursing & Nutrition, chiba, Japan; 8University of Human Environments, Child Health Nursing, Okazaki, Japan Background/Objectives: A Japanese Society of Pediatric Oncology Nursing study group developed \"Nursing Care Guidelines for Children with Cancer 2012\" to standardize children's cancer nursing in Japan in 2012. In addition, we examined the degree of importance and the frequency of each nursing practice based on the guidelines to evaluate this guideline in 2016. As a result, nurses recognized that almost all nursing practices on the guideline were important. However, nurses felt difficulties implementing a few nursing care despite their recognition. This study examines factors influencing nursing practice to improve children's cancer nursing in Japan. Design/Methods: We sent two different of questionnaires to 216 wards where children with cancer were hospitalized. The questionnaire is composed of the following two categories. 1. On frequency of nursing practice Asked how frequently they bring their practice into action based on the 46 items in the Guidelines. 2. On their hospital environment Asked how their team is composed, the arrangement of certified nurse specialist, and physical environment for children in their wards. We analyzed answers from 56 wards that completely answered questions from two categories, in order to see the relationship between the frequency of nursing practice and their hospital environment. Out of this 56 wards, 43 were university hospitals, 7 were children's hospitals and 5 were general hospitals. For data analysis, we conducted a MannWhitneyU test using SPSS statistics Ver.21. Results: We found that the following 4 hospital environment factors especially have strong influences to the frequency of the nursing practice. - The arrangement of certified nurse specialist - The presence of \"Nursing Care Guidelines 2012\"in their wards - The presence of longterm followup system for children with cancer - The presence of teen room Conclusions: From the results, some of the influencing factors on the nursing practice have been revealed. Enhancing those factors in their wards will raise the quality of the nursing practice. Treatment and Care Biology and Pathology P-515 Characterization of the Immune Infiltrate in Pediatric Solid Tumors by Flow Cytometry V. Botafogo1, C. FerreiraFacio1, P. Ferr\u00e3o1, Sobral da Costa1 1Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Pediatric Institute IPPMG, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; 2University of Salamanca, Cancer Research Center, Salamanca, Spain Background/Objectives: Interactions between cancer and immune cells can influence treatment response and patients\u00b4 prognosis. The proposed strategy aims at characterizing the infiltrating immune cells in solid tumors and in metastatic sites from pediatric patients with cancer using Multiparameter Flow Cytometry (MFC). Design/Methods: Eightyseven samples were obtained at diagnosis from 67 patients suspicious of pediatric cancer 44.8% males and 55.2% females. A MFC panel of markers was used for the identification and characterization of tumor and immune cells. The MannWhitney U test was used for continuous variables (SPSS, version 21.0, Chicago, IL). Results: Fiftysix patients (83.6%) had cancer and 11 (16.4%) had inflammatory/reactive diseases. Within solid tumors we found a (median:0.55; n=8). Conversely, CD4/CD8 ratio was 1 There was a statistically significant difference (p<0.05) between the percentage of T cells in soft tissue sarcomas - median:3.0% (1.0 - 11.8) and nasopharyngeal carcinomas - median:32.9% (15 - 36.8); and also between nasopharyngeal carcinomas and germ cell tumors - median:6.2% (0.2 - 36.7). Concerning BM samples (n=27), BM infiltrated with neuroblastic tumors (n=9) had significantly more total T cells median:7.6% (3.0 - 39.0) than noninfiltrated BM of patients with neuroblastic tumors (n=11) - median:5.4% (2.0 - 10.8) and also than reactive/inflammatory BM - median:5.4% (4.1 - 6.5). Conclusions: Our data showed that there are different patterns of T cell tumor infiltration according to disease categories. Such differences can relate to distinct patterns of tumor aggressiveness. In addition, infiltrating neuroblastic cells seem to induce an increase of total T cells in BM. Further investigation is necessary to elucidate the role of these differences. P-516 Antitumor Activity of Flubendazole in a Neuroblastoma Tumor Model E. Cecen 1, Z. Altun1, S. Laboratory Animal izmir, Turkey Background/Objectives: Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumor in children. Half of all patients presenting with neuroblastoma have metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis, and their overall prognosis has been poor despite intensive therapy. Flubendazole had been demonstrated to exert activity against leukaemia, myeloma and neuroblastoma cells. The aim of the study was to investigate antitumor activity of flubendazole in a neuroblastoma. Design/Methods: The effects of flubendazole on the C1300 neuroblastoma cell line were measured in vitro by using MTT assay. C1300 cells were injected subcutaneously to nude mice. Twenty male 4weekold mice were used (5 mice each group). All the mice were divided into 4 groups. Group I; Control group, Group II; Flubendazole group (50 Cisplatin group (16 mg/kg/day), Group IV; Flubendazole+cisplatin group. Each group was treated every 3 days and the next day sacrificed. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The electrically evoked auditory brainstem response (EABR) was evaluated in all mice. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS. The significance of the data was analyzed using KruskalWallis and MannWhitneyU and pvalues of p < 0.05 were considered significant. Results: Ld50 doses of flubendazole were determined and 50 mg/kg flubendazole was administered accordingly. The rates of necrobiyosis in tumors were evaluated. Tumor necrosis were higher in the group II, III and IV, when compared to the group I (control) (p=0.029). Rates of tumor necrosis at group I, II, II and IV were %5, %46.25, %48.95, %70, respectively. In all groups, except for the control group, serum creatinin levels were increased. Conclusions: Flubendazole showed no more toxic effect than cisplatin and led to cell death at similar levels with cisplatin. Application of these data to clinical practice requires further studies. P-517 Low Phase Angle (PA) Values of the Electrical Bioimpedance Analysis (BIA) in Pediatric Patients with Cancer A. GAROFOLO 1, K.J.T. GUEDES1, P. MAIALEMOS1 1IOP/GRAACC/UNIFESP, Pediatric, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil Background/Objectives: PA is direct measure of cell stability and can be interpreted as indicator of membrane integrity and predictor of body cell mass and as a prognosis indicator of survival in clinical situations. Its use is described as valid even in situations with oscillations in the hydration state. To know the PA values obtained through the BIA in patients with cancer and to characterize the sample for this indicator, and to compare PA values with reference values in the healthy pediatric population. Design/Methods: Pilot crosssectional study with pediatric patients diagnosed with malignant neoplasm. The study used BIA which describes the response of living organisms to an externally applied current. It is a measure of opposition to the flow of the applied current through tissues. Results: Thirtythree patients (45% on chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, 33% new cases and 21% on hematopoietic stem cell transplants) were evaluated, with an average of 10 years, 19 (57.6%) were male, with no difference for age between genders. Tumors of the central nervous system (33%) and leukemias (21%) were the main diagnoses in the study. Disease recurrences accounted for 15% of the total. 39 % were underweight and 51% were overweight. The BMI for the total sample was 17.5 \u00b1 6.1. AF had a mean of 4.79 \u00b1 1.5, (4.78 for females and 4.8 for males). Compared to the healthy pediatric population, oncological patients present lower AF means (5.5 vs 4.8). Conclusions: Despite the small number of the sample, a PA lower than that found in the healthy pediatric population was demonstrated. Studies have shown that low PA values in critically ill patients are associated with poor nutritional status, poorer clinical outcome and higher mortality. P-518 SNPS in Micrornas Associated with Vincristine Induced Neurotoxicity in Children with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia M. Umerez1, \u00c1. GutierrezCamino1, M. Astigarraga2, A. Navajas5, A. GarciaOrad1 1University of the Basque Country, Genetics Physical Anthropology and Animal Physiology, Leioa, Spain; 2University Hospital Cruces, Department of Pediatrics, Bilbao, Spain; Hospital La Paz, Department of Oncohaematology, Madrid, Donostia, Department Spain; 5BioCruces Health Research Institute, BioCruces Health Research Institute, bilbao, Spain Background/Objectives: Vincristine (VCR), an important component of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) therapy, often causes sensory and motor neurotoxicity. This neurotoxicity could lead to dose reduction or treatment discontinuation. Several studies associated peripheral neurotoxicity with polymorphisms in genes involved in pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of VCR. Nowadays, it is well known that these genes are regulated by microRNAs (miRNAs) and SNPs in miRNAs could modify their levels or function. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether SNPs in miRNAs could be associated with VCRinduced neurotoxicity. Design/Methods: The association analysis was performed in a cohort of 155 Spanish children with BALL treated with LAL/SHOP protocol. We selected all the SNPs described in premiRNAs with a MAF>1% (213 SNPs in 206 miRNAs) that could regulate VCR PK/PD genes. Genotyping was performed with VeraCode GoldenGate platform. Results: Statistically significant association was found between 8 miRNA SNPs and neurotoxicity during induction phase. The most significant result in this study was found for the rs12402181 in the seed region of miR3117, in which A variant allele showed a decreased risk of peripheral neurotoxicity. This miRNA could target ABCC1 and RALBP1 VCR transport genes. Conclusions: In the present study we detected a SNP in the seed region of in miR3117, which could alter ABCC1 and RALBP1 VCR transport genes expression and consequently affect VCRinduced neurotoxicity in patients with pediatric BALL. This project was supported by Basque Government (IT98916). P-519 Expression of Wilms Tumor 1 and CD31 in Hemangioma Q. Shu 1, Y. Shu1, Y. Liu1 1Children's Hospital Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Department of Surgery, Hangzhou, China Background/Objectives: To analyze the clinicopathological features of the Noninvoluting congenital hemangioma (NICH), and to evaluate the expression 1 (WT1) and CD31 in NICH. Design/Methods: Thirtyeight patients from our hospital who were diagnosed with NICH during January 2014 and May 2016 were included in this study. The control group included 38 patients who were diagnosed with vascular malformations (VM). Based on the appearance of the hemangiomas (flat or slightly bossed), NICHs were divided into two groups: bossed group and plaquelike group. The pathological characteristics and the expression of WT1 and CD31 were analyzed. Results: The 38 NICH cases included 27 males and 11 females, aged 1Y6M to 10Y3M (mean 4Y10M). Immunohistochemical study showed NICH, positive in the endothelial cells and pericytes. There was significant difference in the positive rate of WT1 expression between NICH and VM (Fisher exact probability test, P<0.01). CD31 was intensely and diffusely expressed in all NICHs, including the small vessels of the lobules, irregular stellate vessels and the anomalous vessels in the fibrous tissues between the lobules. No difference in the positive rate of CD31 expression between NICH and VM was observed. The expression levels of both WT1 and CD31 in the plaquelike group were significantly higher than those of the bossed group (Person 2=10.481 and 10.596, respectively, P<0.05). The expression of WT1 positively bossed type was more common. WT1 and CD31 were expressed in all NICH specimens, with different expression levels between the plaquelike type and the bossed type. Expression of WT1 in NICH positively correlated with CD31. P-520 Charaterization of Onofre Research Center, Barretos, Brazil; 2Brazilian Center for Research in Energy and Materials National Laboratory of Biosciences LNBio, Campinas, Pathology, Barretos, Brazil Background/Objectives: Osteosarcoma comprises 5% of the tumors in children and adolescents. It is an aggressive disease with metastatic patients evolving with very poor clinical outcomes. We hypothesized that DNA methylation changes could be associated with the mechanisms involved with transformation and progression in osteosarcomas. Design/Methods: We profiled DNA methylation in 28 chemotherapynaive samples from patients with osteosarcomas and nine normal bone tissues using the Illumina HumanMethylation 450K Beadchip arrays. Methylation data were corrected for technical bias and cellular composition effects. Results: Supervised comparison using a Bayesian framework linear model identified 3,146 differentially methylated pvalue<0.01 and methylation differences >10%) between osteosarcoma and bone samples, with the majority of CpG sites (n=1,997, 63%) showing an hypermethylated state in osteosarcoma samples. In addition, bumphunter analysis identified 95 differentially methylated regions (DMRs). We found that tumors exhibited an hypermethylated state of the DMR that controls PTEN expression. PTEN downregulation was associated to increased tumor growth in osteosarcoma cells. At DMS and DMR levels, methylation changes identified here were enriched to chromatin assembly and remodeling, DNA packing and gene transcriptional control suggesting that DNA methylation may be involved with osteosarcoma disease. They were also enriched for skeletal system morphogenesis and development potinting to the involvement of DNA methylation with the disruption of mechanism that control bone cell differentiation. Conclusions: Our analysis revealed that DNA methylation changes might be associated with cellular transformation in osteosarcoma. These changes may be controlling expression of genes related to biological processes involved with disruption of the correct cell differentiation and transformation. Finally, osteosarcoma showed a tendency to an hypermethylated state compared to normal bone samples. P-521 Changes in DNA Methylation May be Associated with Wilms 1Brazilian Center for Research in Energy and Materials CNPEM, National Laboratory of Biosciences LNBio, Campinas, Brazil; 2Research Center National Institute of Cancer, Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Program, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; 3Research Center National Institute of Cancer, Department of Pathology, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Background/Objectives: Wilms tumors (WTs) have a relapse rate of 25%, from which longterm survival remains approximately 50%. Blastemal predominant WT have a higer risk of relapsing and was associated with resistance to chemotherapy and capacity of forming distant metastasis. DNA methylation changes could be associated with the mechanisms involved with Ws progression and resistance. We aimed to identify the underlying mechanisms involved with metastasis formation in WT. Design/Methods: A comprehensive DNA methylation using the Illumina arrays was applied to matched kidney, WT blastemal component and metastatic tissues from patients treated under SIOP 2001 protocol. Methylation data was corrected for technical effects and cellular composition. Results: A Bayesian framework linear model considering intrapatients and identified differentially and metastasis. pattern of these DMPs showed that whilst WT displayed an hypomethylation profile compared to kidney, metastatic samples had an hypermethylated profile compared to both. DMPs were enriched manl biological processes involved wih embronic development, morphogenesis and cellular differentiation. They were also related to genes enriched for pathways related to metabolism, mTOR and PI3KAKT signaling pathways. Several genes with a role in nephrogenesis and disrupted in WT appeared as differentially methylated in our analysis, in agreement with the literature. To identify the most differentially methylated regions (DMRs), a Gaussian kernel algorithim from DMRcate was applied to WT and kidney tissues. This analysis showed 36 DMRs between WT and kidney samples, which were located next to 28 genes, including CYP26C1 that catalyze reactions involved in drug metabolism. Conclusions: Altogether, we found that Wilms tumors exhibited an hypomethylated state compared to normal kidney, and both were hypomethylated compared to metastatic samples. These methylation changes could be controlling the expression of genes associated with Wilms tumor progression. P-522 Identification of Receptor Tyrosine Kinases and Downstream Signaling Pathways as Possible Therapeutic Targets Phosphoprotein Arrays J. J. Experimental Biology, Brno, Czech Republic; 2University Hospital Brno and School of Medicine of Pediatric Oncology, Brno, Czech Republic; 3St. Anne's University Hospital, International Clinical Research Center, Brno, Czech Republic Background/Objectives: The main aim of our study is to identify activity of the RTK signaling pathways as well as of the downstream signaling pathways in pediatric refractory and/or relapsed solid tumors. Primary samples of tumor tissue taken from the individual patients, as well as paired samples (i.e., primary tumor sample and relapsed tumor sample) are analyzed in detail to find the possible targets for personalized biological therapy using monoclonal antibodies and lowmolecularweight inhibitors. Design/Methods: The experimental approaches include the RTK and MAPK phosphorylation protein arrays to determine patterns of activity in these two groups of signaling transducers. These arrays allowed us to identify activities of 49 human RTKs and 24 downstream signaling molecules. Results: Till now (March 2017), we analyzed 157 samples in total. 88 patients have examined primary tumors only, 31 patients both primary and relapsed tumors and 7 patients have analyzed three subsequent tumor samples. According to ICCC3 classification, the most frequent tumor types were soft tissue sarcomas, CNS tumors and bone tumors. This number of samples allowed us to perform also a detailed analysis of RTK and downstream signaling profiles that clearly showed that histogenetically different groups of tumors clearly differ also in their cell signaling activities. Furthermore, we can also demonstrate the changes in cell signaling pattern after administration of lowmolecularweight inhibitors during the course of the disease in patients suffering with rhabdomyosarcoma, Maffucci syndrome or multiple infantile myofibromatosis. Conclusions: To summarize, our obtained results bring completely new information concerning the changes in RTK and downstream activity patterns associated with the course of disease that may be important for determination of personalized therapy for these children.

P-523 Childhood Tumours with a High Probability of Being Part of a Tumour Predisposition Syndrome; Reason for Referral for Genetic Consultation F. Postema 1, S. Hopman1, C. Aalfs2, L. Berger3, Center, Pediatric Oncology, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; 2Academic Medical Center, Clinical Genetics, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; 3University Medical Centre Groningen, Genetics, Groningen, The Netherlands; 4VU University Medical Centre, Clinical Genetics, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; 5Radboud University Medical Centre, Human Genetics, Groningen, The Netherlands; 6University Medical Centre Utrecht, Genetics, Utrecht, The Netherlands; 7Erasmus Medical Centre, Clinical Genetics, Rotterdam, The Netherlands; 8Academic Medical Center, Pediatrics, Amsterdam, The Netherlands Background/Objectives: Recognising a tumour predisposition syndrome (TPS) in patients with childhood cancer is of major clinical relevance. The presence of a TPS may be suggested by the type of tumour in the child. We present an overview of 20 childhood tumours that in themselves should be a reason to refer a child for genetic consultation. Design/Methods: We performed a PubMed search to review the incidence of TPSs in children for 74 tumour types listed in the International Classification of Childhood Cancer third edition (ICCC3). The results were discussed during a national consensus meeting with representative clinical geneticists from all six academic paediatric oncology centres in The Netherlands. A TPS incidence of 5% or more was considered a high probability and therefore in itself a reason for referral to a clinical geneticist. Results: The literature search resulted in data on the incidence of a TPS in 23 tumours. For 20/23 tumour types a TPS incidence of 5% or higher was reported. In addition, during the consensus meeting the experts agreed that children with any carcinoma should always be referred for clinical genetic consultation as well, as it may point to a TPS. Conclusions: We present an overview of 20 paediatric tumours with a high probability of a TPS; this will facilitate paediatric oncologists to decide which patients should be referred for genetic consultation merely based on type of tumour. P-524 Concentrations of PlasmaFree Amino Acids in Pediatric Cancers A. Synakiewicz 1, M. SawickaZukowska2, N. Adrianowska3, G. Galezowska4, Owczarzak5, Poland; Hematology, Bialystok, Poland; 3Medical of and Diabetology, Lodz, Poland; 4Medical Environmental Toxicology, Gdask, Poland; 5Medical University of Gdansk, Department of Clinical Nutrition, Gdask, Poland Background/Objectives: Pediatric cancer remains one of the main cause of death in the pediatric population because of its low detection rate in the early stage. No single substance is known to be sensitive and specific enough to detect cancer cells and play a role as an early biomarker. Malignant neoplastic diseases are metabolic conditions with unique metabolism, thus amino acids and level alterations in plasma are considered to play a role in carcinogenesis and further course of the disease. Design/Methods: Seventy seven children with cancer, including 47 with hematological malignancies (leukemias, nonHodgkin and Hodgkin lymphomas) and 30 with solid tumors (nephroblastoma, neuroblastoma, soft tissue sarcomas, malignant brain tumor, germ cell tumors) were enrolled in this multicenter study. 22 plasmafree amino acids were determined by highperformance liquid chromatography with fluorometric detection. Results: The results revealed significant differences between children with cancer and healthy control. Conclusions: This report suggest that plasmafree amino acid profiling may be used in cancer diagnoses and may be considered as an early tumor biomarker. Further study in this specific group is necessary to verify the metabolic patterns characteristic of pediatric cancer. P-525 A Retrospective Analysis of Molecular Profiling of Pediatric Solid Tumors Using OmniSeq Comprehensive L. Wiltsie 1, A. PapanicolauSengos2, C. Morrison2, K. Kelly1, M. Barth1 1Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Pediatrics, Buffalo, USA; 2OmniSeq LLC, Pathology, Buffalo, USA Background/Objectives: Tumor molecular profiling holds the promise of personalized diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic decision making. Due to cost and limited availability, molecular profiling data of pediatric tumors is limited. A small number of centers have performed large scale, genome wide screening for molecular alterations in pediatric tumors identifying about 3040% of pediatric tumors with potentially actionable alterations. OmniSeq Comprehensive, a New York State approved nextgeneration sequencing assay, utilizes a targeted approach to molecular profiling that screens tumor DNA and RNA to identify somatic variants in 144 genes focusing on genomic alterations known to be associated with cancer. Design/Methods: We analyzed OmniSeq Comprehensive profiling of high risk solid tumors and brain tumors from pediatric patients treated in Buffalo, NY from July 2016 to March 2017. All results were reviewed at an ongoing Pediatric Molecular Tumor Board. Results: Tumor samples from 21 patients age 2 months22 years were analyzed. Results were available within 2 weeks of obtaining a sample for testing in each case. At least one variant was identified in 17/21 (81%) of patients with a mean of 1.6 variants/patient. Eight patients (38%) had a variant considered potentially actionable. Six patients (29%) had a lesion targetable with an agent in clinical trials, but did not meet eligibility requirements. In one patient with inflammatory myofibroblastic sarcoma, molecular testing identified an ALK gene fusion, not identified by FISH, that aided in identifying the diagnosis and led to targeted therapy with crizotinib as first line therapy. Conclusions: OmniSeq Comprehensive identified actionable variants in children with high risk solid and brain tumors at a rate similar to published results for genome wide molecular profiling approaches. The results of this pilot study highlight the potential role of a more cost effective, targeted approach to molecular profiling in pediatric oncology patients. Imaging P-526 Value of PET/CT in Treatment Response to Chemotherapy in Musculoskeletal Tumors R. LopezAlmaraz 1, M. GarciaAriza1, J.M. De Medicine Service, Cruces Bilbao, Spain Background/Objectives: To evaluate the correlation between anatomopathological (AP) tumour necrosis in musculoskeletal tumours and the morphometabolic response observed in 18FFDG PET/CT. Design/Methods: Retrospective descriptive study. We collected data on pediatric new diagnoses of bone and soft tissue sarcomas (STS) in a tertiary hospital in the last 3 years (January 2014January 2017). Results: Seventeen patients were newly diagnosed during those years: 6 (35%) with Ewing sarcoma (ES), 5 (30%) Osteosarcoma (OS) and 6 STS, of which 5 (83%) were Rhabdomyosarcomas (RMS). Within the (ES 5/6 patients underwent PET/CT. Two presented a complete morphometabolic response coinciding with a 100% AP tumor necrosis. Two others presented a very good partial response in the imaging test, with tumour necrosis being 96 and 98% respectively. The last patient presented a partial response in PET/CT; but could not undergo surgery for its inoperability. In the case of the 5 OS; only two PET/CT scans were performed at the presurgical evaluation. these presented partial response in PETCT and had a necrosis of 34% and 65% respectively. In the STS, PET/CT was performed in 4 of 6 patients: one with complete response; but could not undergo surgery because of its high surgical risk. In the other three patients, PET/CT showed a good partial response with complete necrosis in two and partial necrosis in the other. Conclusions: In our series, PET/CT is a valuable diagnostic tool for the initial extension study and to evaluate the chemotherapy response of bone and soft tissue tumors. Further studies are needed to demonstrate their degree of direct correlation with tumour necrosis of histological pieces. P-527 First FDG PET/MRI Experience Pediatric Oncology, Ankara, Turkey; 2Istanbul University Cerrahpaa School of Medicine, Nuclear Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey; 3Gazi University School of Medicine, Nuclear Medicine, Ankara, Turkey; 4Gazi University School of Medicine, Pediatric Hematology, Ankara, Turkey Background/Objectives: PET/MRI has recently been introduced as an alternative to PET/CT and pediatric patients are expected to be one of the main target groups for PET/MRI, which has considerably less ionizing radiation compared to PET/CT. The aim of our study is to compare FDG PET/CT and PET/MRI in our group of pediatric oncological patients in terms of anatomical correlation of FDG positive lesions. Design/Methods: Total 31 pediatric oncological patients were included in our study. The median age was 9 years (range: 6 months15 years). Nine patients were diagnosed for lymphoma (2 of them were Hodgkin lymphoma), 4 neuroblastoma, 3 rhabdomyosarcoma, 3 ALL, 4 Langerhans cell histiocytosis, 2 Ewing sarcoma, 2 ovarian cancer, 1 glioblastoma multiforme, 1 pelvic germ cell tumor, 1 renal clear cell carcinoma and 1 conjunctival squamous cell carcinoma. Total 39 sequential FDG PET/CT (GE Discovery ST) and PET/MRI (GE Signa PET/MR) examinations were performed on the same day after injection of mean 3,3 mCi (122 MBq) FDG. PET/MRI was performed first in 5 patients and PET/CT was obtained first in the rest of the patients. All images were evaluated by 2 nuclear medicine physicians separately. Results: On lesion based analysis, total 16 sequential PET/CT and PET/MRI examinations were concordantly negative. Among 47 FDG positive lesions in 18 sequential PET/CT and PET/MRI examinations (maximum 5 lesions/patient), 37 were positive with both CT and MRI. Remaining 10 FDG positive lesions (2 central nervous system, 4 bone marrow, 2 lymph nodes, 2 soft tissue lesions) could not be differentiated using CT although it could be demarcated using MRI. Conclusions: PET/MRI showed better anatomical correlation in FDG positive lesions compared to PET/CT in our pediatric patients. Therefore FDG PET/MRI, with reduced ionizing radiation and better contrast resolution in soft tissue and bone marrow, may be a preferred alternative to PET/CT in the pediatric population. P-528 DiffusionWeighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging Shows A Critical Difference Between Supratentorial and Infratentorial Pediatric Ependymoma J. Murray 1, H. Head2, Hoeft1, Margraf3 1Cook Children's Health Worth, USA; 2Cook System, Radiology, Fort Worth, USA; 3Cook Children's Health Care System, Pathology, Fort Worth, USA Background/Objectives: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features differ between various childhood brain tumors. Advanced MRI techniques including diffusionweighted imaging (DWI) can add vital information to conventional sequences, potentially crucial in creating an appropriate differential diagnosis. Ependymoma, the third most common malignant brain tumor in youth, remains challenging with respect to an imaging differential diagnosis. We have recognized a critical difference in DWI characteristics between supratentorial (ST) and infratentorial (IT) ependymomas in children. Design/Methods: Following IRB approval, we rereviewed the MRIs and neuropathology from 30 consecutively diagnosed children with intracranial ependymomas, 20072016, abstracting for tumor location (ST vs IT), diffusion characteristics and tumor grade. Chisquare and Cramer's V tests were applied. Results: The mean age at diagnosis was 5 years (18 boys, 12 girls). Eighteen patients had IT tumors and 12 had ST tumors. Ten tumors had anaplastic histology (WHO grade III) and 20 had classic histology (WHO grade II). Eleven tumors showed restricted diffusion on DWI, and 19 did not (13 facilitated diffusion and 6 were equivalent to surrounding brain). All tumors that showed restricted diffusion were ST; none were IT. Of the 11 restricting tumors, 3 had anaplastic histology. Of the 13 nonrestricting tumors, 4 had anaplasia. The relationship between tumor location and restricted diffusion was significant and strongly associated (2(1) = 26.053, p = 0.000, Cramer's imaging can supplement conventional MRI sequences in formulating a critical differential diagnosis in children with brain tumors. Our analysis shows a dramatic difference in diffusion characteristics between ST and IT ependymomas, independent of tumor grade. Supratentorial tumors tend to show restricted diffusion, but IT tumors, irrespective of grade, do not restrict. We postulate that there are physiologic tumor microenvironmental factors that account for this observation. Awareness of DWI differences in ependymoma may be helpful in refining the initial differential diagnosis. P-529 Correlation of Brown Fat to Disease State in Lymphoma Patients S. Servaes1, L. States 1, A. Ntoulia1 1The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and The University of Pennsylvania, Radiology, Philadelphia, USA Background/Objectives: The purpose of our study was to determine if there is a relationship between the depiction of brown adipose tissue (BAT) with positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in pediatric patients with Hodgkin lymphoma and the disease and season. Design/Methods: In total, 126 PET/CT studies of 41 subjects (25 boys and 16 girls) with ages ranging from 622 years with diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma were retrospectively reviewed. The uptake and anatomic distribution of BAT were evaluated at PET/CT scans in every subject at the time of initial diagnosis and after completion of chemotherapy. Comparisons regarding the presence of BAT at these two time intervals were performed between each subject using McNemar's test. Correlations of BAT presence with children's gender, anthropometric data (body mass index and height), examination parameters (FDG and Glucose) as well as season were performed. Results: 80/126 (63.5%) of PET/CT studies showed no disease activity, whereas in 46/126 (36.5%) of PET/CT presence of Hodgkin lymphoma disease was identified. Among patients with no active disease, in 23/80 (28.8%) PET/CT studies there were high BAT uptake, whereas among patients with active disease more BAT uptake was observed in 8/46 (17.4%) examinations. This difference was marginally significant (p=0.05). There was no significant relationship between BAT uptake and the season that PET/CT study was performed (p=0.74). Finally BAT uptake was not associated with examination parameters including the FDG dose (p=0.06). Conclusions: Our findings show a marginal correlation between the BAT uptake and the disease state. However, contrary to what other studies have demonstrated, in our study BAT uptake was not associated to the season that the PET/CT examination was performed and the FDG dosage. P-530 Laparoscopy as a Primary Investigatory Tool in Pediatric Abdominal Massess O. Zakaria 1 1King Faisal University, College Of Medicine, Al Ahsa, Saudi Arabia Background / Objectives: BACKGROUND: Abdominal masses still pose as a major challenge for pediatrcialn and surgeons. AIM OF THE WORK: This study was designated to evaluate the role of diagnostic laparoscopy in investigating equivocal pediatric masses that had undergone other imaging modalities. Design/Methods: A combined prospective and retrospective multicentric study for the period of 13 years from January 2005 to December 2016. Inclusion Criteria: all children from 3 months of age to 15 years were studied. Exclusion Criteria: those who have a documented diagnosis through other imaging modalities including sonographic and or CT guided biopsy. All patients underwent multiport diagnostic laparoscopy for biopsy from the mass. All specimens were hispatologically assessed using H&E staining, some specimens were immunohistochemically studied, patients mean follow up was 3.6 years. Results: A total of 132 of patients were recruited in this study they were 69 males and 63 girls with the male to female ratio of1.1:1 the age ranged from 3 month up to 15 years with the mean age 0f 2.7 \u00b1 0.8. Out of the total studied group 54 patients were diagnosed as neuroblastoma with the percentage of 40.9% while 66 were having nephroblastoma while the remaining 12 (9.1%) were having nonHodgkin's abdominal lymphoma. All patients did not show any complications related to the procedure. Patients mean follow up was 3.6 years. Most of cases (121) with different diagnosis were clinically staged as grade I to grade II (91.7%). Neither intraoperative or post operative complications were recorded during this technique. The mean operative time was recorded to be 72 mins \u00b1 20 in the earliest group; yet, it has declined to be 32 \u00b1 12 mins in the latest group due to the advancement of the learning curve. Conclusions: Laparoscopy is an accurate, safe and should be used as the sole tool for biopsing solid abdominal tumors in pediatrics. P-531 Reliability of Elastographic Sonography in Predicting Pediatric Cervical Lymph Node Malignancy O. Zakaria 1 1King Faisal University, College Of Medicine, Al Ahsa, Saudi Arabia Background/Objectives: Preliminary studies suggest that ultrasonographic (US) elastography may be useful in differentiating benign and malignant cervical lymph nodes, thereby informing decisions to perform a biopsy and facilitating followup. The current study aimed to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of US elastography in distinguishing malignant pediatric malignant cervical lymphadenopathy from benign lesions. Design/Methods: A total of 177 lymph nodes in 128 children with the age ranging form 11months to 12 years ; they were 77 males and 51 females with a ratio of 1.5:1. A preliminary diagnosis primary head and neck cancer were examined by Bmode sonography, power Doppler ultrasound and elastography. Elastographic patterns were determined on the distribution and percentage of the lymph node area with low elasticity (hard), with pattern 1 being an absent or very small hard area to pattern 5, a hard area occupying the entire lymph node. Patterns 3-5 were considered metastatic. Ultrasound guided aspiration cytology was done for 107 lymph nodes. Results: The majority 154 (87%) of metastatic lymph nodes had elastography pattern 3-5. This finding was observed in only 6 (3.4) % of the benign lymph nodes (P < 0.001). The elastography pattern had sensitivity of 87.3%, specificity of 96.5%, PPV of 98.2%, NPV of 73.1% and overall accuracy of 91.9% in differentiation between benign and malignant lymph nodes. On the other hand, for the B mode criteria, the best accuracy was given to abnormal hilum (73%). The accuracy of power Doppler ultrasound pattern was 65.8%. Conclusions: The accuracy of sonoelastography is higher than other sonographic modalities in elucidating the pathology and diagnosis of cervical lymphadenopathy distinguishing between benign and malignant lesions. This may replace the lymph node biopsies in the future. Moreover, The integration of lymph node sonoelastography in the follow up of patients with known head and neck cancer may reduce the number of biopsies. Epidemiology Pathway of Care P-532 Training of Childhood Cancer Ambassadors: A NurseLed Capacity Building Project to Improve Early Diagnosis of Childhood Cancer in Northwest Cameroon G. Afungchwi 1, K. Francine2, P. Hesseling3, V. Njamnshi4, P. Nana2, J. Kaah4 1Cameroon Convention Health Services, Childhood Cancer 4Banso Baptist Hospital, Pediatric Oncology, Kumbo, Cameroon Background/Objectives: In resource poor countries, many children with cancer are diagnosed at late stages, which makes cure impossible(Awadelkarim et al. 2012; Sullivan et al. 2014).Childhood cancer symptoms are usually missed by community health professionals due to their unfamiliarity with these signs. Even when referred with suspicion of cancer, lack of transportation means becomes a major cause of delay(Afungchwi et al., 2016). The objective of this project was to promote early diagnosis and prompt treatment of childhood cancers through the use of trained ambassadors and mobile money. Design/Methods: Health professionals and prominent traditional healers for 6 health districts were invited to their respective district health services for training. The training included topics on biology of cancer, the early warning signs of childhood cancer, and the availability of care for children with cancer in Cameroon. Three trainees from each health district were selected as Childhood cancer Ambassadors and provided with mobile phones and mobile money accounts to transport every suspected patient to the treatment centre. Results: 133 health care providers (including 20 traditional healers) were trained, and 18 ambassadors selected and equipped for referrals. There was a 33.8 percentage point increase(p<0.001) in knowledge about childhood cancers among trainees and the proportion of trainees providing health education on childhood cancers to their communities is expected to increase from 14% to 100%(p<0.001). A total of 9,000 childhood cancer warning signs leaflets were distributed. The cost of training was \u20ac27.2 per trainee. Conclusions: The SanofiEspoir MCM Awards has provided an opportunity to build capacity for childhood cancer early diagnosis in Northwest Cameroon. This project has the potential to become a formal surveillance model for childhood cancers and, if expanded to cover the entire region, would create a net through which no child with cancer could filter undiagnosed. P-533 Challenges Faced in Pediatric Hematology/Oncology in a Developing Country: The Children's Hospital Lahore Pakistan Experience A. Ahmad 1, N. Tahira1, M. Sadiq1, M.Y. Kazi1 1Children's Hospital Haematology/Oncology, Lahore, Pakistan Background/Objectives: In Punjab Pakistan for a 200 million population there are very few dedicated pediatric hematology/oncology centers resulting in delayed diagnosis and poor management of majority these children. Objective of this study was to evaluate the challenges faced in pediatric hematology/oncology services in resource limited settings like the Children's Hospital Lahore which is a 60 bedded unit with bed occupancy of 200% and 300 new admissions per month and over 1000 new childhood cancer cases each year. Design/Methods: Retrospective review of 140 cases enrolled and died in the department from January to December 2016 for their epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, stay in hospital and cause of death and analyzed with SPSS17. Results: Among 140 patients analyzed 106/140(76%) were below 10 years with M: F ratio 2.3:1.71/140 (51%) had their diagnosis established at admission while 131/140(93%) had their diagnosis confirmed before they died. Only 50% cases had their definite treatment started before they died.36% were diagnosed as ALL,38% with solid MDS, Factor VII deficiency. Febrile neutropenia and sepsis was the major killer in 95/140(68%) while 45/140(32%) died due to relapse or progression of disease. When cause of death analyzed for type of diagnosis (pvalue: 0.022) and stay in hospital (pvalue: 0.001) and definite treatment given or not (pvalue: 0.000) while 93% cases were diagnosed before death but only 50% cases were started on the treatment(pvalue:0.016). 16% cases died within 24 hrs of admission while 58% stayed up to 2 weeks 50% of cases has to travel >100 KM to reach the Children's Hospital Lahore. Conclusions: There is an urgent need of capacity building with more centers and trained health professionals, implementation of effective infection control measures and efficient psycho social support for these families to decrease the morbidity and mortality in this center. P-534 Differential Survival Rates in State Funded and Privately Funded Paediatric Oncology Units in Johannesburg, South Africa K. Bennett 1, J. Geel1, N. Beringer2 1Faculty of Health Sciences University of the Witwatersrand Wits Donald Gordon Medical Centre Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital, Department of Paediatric Oncology, Johannesburg, South Africa; 2Faculty of Health Sciences University of the Witwatersrand Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital, Department of Paediatric Oncology, Johannesburg, South Africa Background/Objectives: Data on survival rates of children with cancer is only available from two South African centres. The reported rate of 52% is lower than that reported in similar uppermiddle income settings in South America and Eastern Europe. The aim of this study was to analyse survival rates of all children with cancer treated in two large referral centres in both the state and private setting. Design/Methods: This retrospective review included all children, (015years) diagnosed with a malignancy at two pediatric oncology units between January 2012 and December 2016. The treatment regimens in both units were identical, the same doctors worked in both settings and all diagnoses were confirmed histologically. Descriptive statistics and KaplanMeier analyses with Cox regression modeling are presented. Results: There were 599 children, 107 of whom presented from outside South Africa. Median follow up was 1.3 years (IQR 0.4 to 2.7). The most common cancers were leukaemias (24.4%), brain tumors (17.7%) and lymphomas (14%). The HIV incidence was 6%. Twoyear overall survival was calculated to be 60%. The highest survival rates were in children with Hodgkin Lymphoma, retinoblastoma and nephroblastoma, while the lowest were noted in children with osteogenic sarcoma and neuroblastoma. Children treated at the private institution had higher twoyear survival rates than those in the state funded hospital (68% vs 55% p=0.0004). Conclusions: Twoyear overall survival rates were higher for children treated in the privately funded unit. This may reflect differential access to specialist care and earlier referral in the private setting. P-535 Incidence of Malignant Solid Tumor in an Adolescent Population in an Equatorian Children Hospital A. Borja 1, Ecuador Background/Objectives: Approximately thirty percent of all pediatric cancers in children and adolescents are solid tumors, most frequent types Brain Tumor, Wilms Tumor, Neuroblastoma, Hepatoblastoma and Osteosarcoma. The differences between solid tumors in childhood and adulthood are well delimited but not in the transition period. Under 15 years old, brain tumors are the most common form of solid tumors, however, according to WHO, between 10 to 15 years old a higher incidence of Osteosarcoma, Ewing tumor and lymphoma was found compared to children. This shows noticeable changes in solid tumor distribution when children reach adolescence. Objetive: To determine incidence of solid malignant tumor in adolescents at Children Hospital in Ecuador from January 2007 to August 2013. Design/Methods: Descriptive, retrospective study including 406 patients between 9years11months and 14years11months old. Inclusion criteria was diagnostic of Malignant solid tumor confirmed by Pathology area. Results: Of 406 patients, fifty six (13.5%) were admitted by Malignant solid tumor. Most of them were males (63 %) and the mean age at diagnosis was 11.5 years old. CNS tumor had the highest incidence (50%) followed by Lymphoma 14%, Osteosarcoma 6%. Distribution by type is similar to epidemiology of malignant solid tumor described by literature however selection bias is possible due to enroll of population admitted in this pediatric hospital only. Conclusions: CNS tumors were most common malignant tumors found. Osteosarcoma appear to be less frequent compared to international series. In addition, a greater number than expected of males were diagnosed. Although epidemiology and distribution of solid tumor in children and adolescents are different, evidence has shown that higher survival incomes in adolescents could be expected by better psychological support and accurate treatment in specialized pediatric centers despite of this differences in the epidemiology. P-536 Impact of Acute MethotrexateInduced Neurotoxicity on Therapy Among Pediatric Patients with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia H. Danysh 1, A. Brown1, M. of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Houston, USA; 2University of Arizona, College of Nursing, Tucson, USA; 3University of Minnesota, School of Nursing, Minneapolis, USA; 4Duke University, School of Nursing, Durham, USA Background/Objectives: Acute methotrexateinduced neurotoxicity (MTXNT) among pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) often results in treatment interruption, potentially reducing treatment efficacy. Despite its clinical significance, the effects of MTXNT on subsequent treatment have not been welldescribed. Therefore, we evaluated the impact of acute MTXNT on delays and modifications to MTX treatment among pediatric patients with ALL. Design/Methods: We identified patients treated on ALL protocols who had reached maintenance therapy at Texas Children's Hospital and University of Arizona in 20122017 (n=158). MTXNT was defined as the occurrence of NTrelated symptoms (e.g., seizure, aphasia) after receiving MTX and led to a change in MTX therapy. Difference in time from diagnosis to start of maintenance, cumulative intravenous MTX dose, and number of intrathecal MTX courses between end of induction and start of maintenance were compared by MTXNT status using multiple linear regression and adjusting for age at diagnosis, sex, ethnicity, and ALL risk stratification. Results: On average, patients were 8.3 years of age at diagnosis (range: 2.518.0). The majority was male (57%), Hispanic (58%), and assigned to high or very high risk treatment arms (56%). A total of 25 patients (16%) experienced acute MTXNT, of which three (12%) subsequently relapsed or died during followup. After adjusting for demographics and risk group, those who experienced acute MTXNT received a 2.7 g/m2 lower dose of intravenous MTX 1.63.3; p<0.001) by the start of maintenance therapy compared to those without MTXNT. The occurrence of MTXNT did not significantly delay the start of maintenance therapy (p=0.680). Conclusions: MTXNT during postinduction chemotherapy for pediatric ALL results in patients receiving significantly less intravenous and intrathecal MTX. Future work is needed to determine whether modifications to therapy following acute MTXNT compromise treatment efficacy or outcomes, including relapse and survival. P-537 Incidence of Childhood Leukemia in Costa Rica from 2001 to 2013: An International Perspective F. Erdmann 1,2, T. Li3, G. Luta3, J. Sch\u00fcz2, A.M. Center, Unit of Survivorship, Copenhagen, Denmark; 2International Agency for Research on Cancer, Section of Environment and Radiation, Lyon, France; 3Georgetown University, Department of Biostatistics Bioinformatics and Biomathematics, Washington DC, USA; 4Universidad Nacional, Central American Institute for Studies on Toxic Substances, Heredia, Costa Rica Background/Objectives: Higher childhood cancer incidence rates, particularly for leukemia, have been reported in highincome countries compared to low and middleincome countries. However, estimating childhood cancer incidence globally is hampered by a lack of reliable data from developing countries, including those from the Latin American region. Costa Rica is one of the few developing countries with a longterm nationwide populationbased cancer registry, enabling the analysis of highquality incidence data on childhood leukemia. Design/Methods: Data on incident leukemia in children under 15 years of age reported to the National Cancer Registry of Costa Rica between 2001 and 2013 were analyzed by leukemia type, age at diagnosis, gender, and region. Results: During the 13year period, a total of 832 children with leukemia were reported, resulting in an overall agestandardized incidence rate (ASR) of 58.1/million. The maletofemale ratio was 1.2. The highest agespecific rate was observed in children aged 14 years (97.7/million). The most frequent leukemia type was lymphoid leukemia; with an ASR of 49.1/million the observed rate ranked among the highest in the world. A very low rate was observed for leukemia in infants, largely driven by the low lymphoid leukemia rate. With respect to geographical differences, higher leukemia rates were observed in the Huetar Atlantica (69.2/million) and Huetar Norte (68.1/million) regions. Both regions are characterized by extensive agricultural fields. Conclusions: The patterns of childhood leukemia incidence in Costa Rica were closer to those reported from highincome countries than to those reported from other developing countries. Further research is needed to investigate which factors may drive the high overall leukemia rate, the low rate observed in infants as well as regional differences. Our study suggests using caution when interpreting global incidence differences, since our observations from a developing country with wellestablished pediatric oncology clinics and nationwide registration showed only small differences to incidence patterns from highincome countries. P-538 Epidemiology of Childhood Cancers in Upper Egypt: Five Years Experience of the Largest Cancer Institute Outside the Capital A. Farrag 1, M.H. Ghzally2 1South Egypt Cancer Oncology, Assiut, Egypt; 2Faculty of Medicine Assiut University, Department of Pediatrics, Assiut, Egypt Background/Objectives: Most previous epidemiological studies have focused on patients in developed countries, or capitals and large cities of developing countries. People in rural areas in developing countries may have different genetic, environmental and life style issues. Design/Methods: This retrospective study was performed through review of charts of newly diagnosed children with cancer who started treatment between 2006 and 2010 in the Department of Pediatric Oncology in South Egypt Cancer Institute (SECI). Analyzed data included: age, sex, diagnosis and stage of the disease, response to initial course of therapy, date of relapse if occurred, and last clinical results of treatment. Results: Between 2006 and 2010, 502 children (291 males and 211 females, 1.4:1) with malignancy started therapy in SECI. The median age at first presentation was 5.2 years (2 months18 years). Diagnoses were commonly leukemia (49%), lymphomas (24%), solid tumors (24%) and rarely brain tumors (1%). At presentation, 62% of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were considered high risk group, 86% of patients with nonHodgkin lymphoma (NHL) presented in late stages (IIIIV), and 90% of neuroblastoma patients presented in stage IV. After initial courses of therapy, 53%, 19%, 43% and 0% of patients with ALL, Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), NHL, and neuroblastoma, respectively, were in complete remission. During initial courses of chemotherapy 21%, 52%, 18% and 2% of patients with ALL, AML, NHL, and neuroblastoma, respectively, died. About 85% of patients were compliant with therapy. Overall, the relapse rate was 14%, median time from diagnosis till relapse was 7 (143) months. Deaths were mainly therapy related (60%). Five years overall and event free survival were 0.45 \u00b1 0.03 and 0.36 \u00b1 0.03, respectively. Conclusions: It is essential to establish country based cancer registries in developing countries to enable own plans. P-539 Early Diagnosis Improvement of Child Cancer in South of Brazil C. Fiori 1, A. Carla Rosa1 1Hospital do C\u00e2ncer Oncology, Cascavel, Brazil Background / Objectives: Introduction: Childhood cancer is a rare disease, but the second leading cause of death between 5 to 19 years old. Otherwise, the cure rate reaches 70% if diagnosed early. Precoce detection considerably reduces the complications of the treatment, and contribute to increase the cure. Objective: Evaluate the degree of tumor involvement in children and adolescents with cancer after training health professionals. Design / Methods: Methodology: Health professionals being trained since 2008, in partnership with the Ronald McDonald Institute, through the Early Diagnosis of Cancer Children and Adolescents Program. There were analyzed children younger than 19 years old attended from January 2008 to December 2016, at Cancer Hospital of Cascavel, Paran\u00e1, Brazil. The Leukemias were considerated - Low Risk(LR) and High Risk( HR) according to age and leukometry at diagnosis: LR: > 12 months and < 10 years old, < 50.000 leukocytes / mm3. HR: < 12 months and > 10 years old, > 50.000 leukocytes / mm3. In solid HR: III/IV. Results: Results 449 patients were attended in the period from 2008 to 2016, of which 248 (55%) were considered High Risk and 201 (45%) Low Risk. There was a predominance of HR over LR per year, from 2009 to 2013. From 2014 until 2016, a predominance of LR over HR. Conclusions: Comments: The preliminary analysis of the data allows us to observe that children and adolescents with cancer have advanced disease at diagnosis. After 2014, we observed change in staging diagnosis of patients who are coming up with more localized disease. It is possible that this change in the between Low Risk and High Risk disease from 2014 may be related to the training activities as a result of the Early Diagnosis Program developed in the West, Northwest and Southwest of Paran\u00e1 since 2008. P-540 Pediatric PopulationBased Cancer Registries in Central America: Insights Shaping Health Policy and Epidemiological Research S. Fuentes Alabi 1, G. Claudia2, M. Carranza1, 1Hospital Nacional de Benjamin Aires, Argentina; 4St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Global International Outreach Program, MemphisTN, USA; 5St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Global Pediatric cancer registries (PBCR) provide a measure of incidence and survival rate\u2014essential for rational health care planning and further epidemiologic research. Before 2014, the incidence of pediatric cancer in Guatemala and El Salvador (G & ES) was estimated based on international models. Since 2014, G & ES has engaged in a systematic collection of data which has yielded an epidemiological profile of childhood cancer that will impact health care systems. Design/Methods: In 2014, the Registro Oncologia PediatricaCentral America (ROPCA) was initiated in G & ES to provide PBCR for children 014y. In each country, a cancer registrar identifies cases through search of pathology and laboratory reports, medical and radiation records. Neither registries currently have access to death certificates. All cases are recorded using the International Classification of DiseaseOncology, version 3. Using the International Classification of Childhood Cancer, the ageadjusted incidence rates per 10^6 population are calculated and standardized to world population. Incidence rates in G & ES were compared to rates of Argentina. Results: The overall incidence in El Salvador was 91.2/10^6 and in Guatemala 71.8/10^6, compared to an incidence of 125/10^6 in Argentina. The expected vs. observed incidence in Guatemala is 56% and in El Salvador, 71%. In both countries, the incidence was lower than expected for neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, renal tumors, germ cell tumors and brain tumors; incidence of hepatic tumors was higher than expected. Conclusions: The ROPCA has demonstrated that the number of children accessing pediatric cancer care is lower than would be expected-likely due to limited access to primary care, lack of recognition of disease in primary care, or competing mortalities. The identification of these factors has already influenced strategies to improve access to care services for the control of childhood cancer. P-541 Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Center's Global Hope (HematologyOncology Pediatric Excellence) K. WilsonLewis 1, Ishigami1, J. Slone2, Allen2, and Hematology Centers, Houston, USA; 2Baylor College of Medicine, Pediatrics, Houston, USA Background/Objectives: Approximately 300,000 children per year develop cancer globally. In SubSaharan Africa (SSA) the majority die due to lack of or incorrect diagnosis, lack of access to medications and inadequate healthcare infrastructure. In contrast, over 80% of children diagnosed with cancer in the U.S. are cured. This inequity compels us to improve pediatric cancer care in SSA. Design/Methods: The Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Centers (TXCH) and Baylor College of Medicine International Pediatric AIDS Initiative (BIPAI) have created a comprehensive program called Global HOPE (HematologyOncology Pediatric Excellence) aimed at building capacity and improving Pediatric Hematology/Oncology (PHO) infrastructure in selected SSA countries. Through partnering with local governments and key stakeholders, Global HOPE implements a countryspecific model based on local need. With a focus on incountry capacity building, Global HOPE educates a broad array of healthcare roles in SSA to support the delivery of highquality, comprehensive, multidisciplinary care. This comprehensive model is aimed at addressing the clinical care, research, education and administrative goals that will create a sustainable model to improve health care access and outcomes, and stakeholder and community involvement, in an environment of operational excellence. Results: Since 2007, across four SSA countries, Global HOPE has increased the capacity of local healthcare workforce by training over 1500 healthcare workers and improved the care of children with cancer or blood disorders demonstrating improved outcomes in each of its sites, including increased case identification through improved diagnostics, increased number of children receiving care and better access to medications. Conclusions: Global HOPE represents a first step towards the ultimate, transformational goal of cure equity for children with cancer and blood disorders in SSA delivered by a locally sustainable workforce and infrastructure. P-542 Development of the Joint Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt (CCHE57357) DanaFarber Boston Children's Hospital Pediatric Oncology Fellowship Program M. H. Hanafy2, R. Khedr 2, Abouelnaga3, Houlahan7, M. P. Pruden9 1National Cancer Institute Cairo University / Children's Hospital Egypt CCHE 57357, Pediatrics Oncology, Cairo, Egypt; 2National Cancer Institute Cairo University / Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt CCHE57357, Pediatrics Oncology, Cairo, Egypt; 3National Cancer Institute Cairo University Egypt Oncology, Ohio, Children Cancer Institute, Pediatric Neurosurgical Oncology, Boston, USA; 6Dana Farber / Boston Children Cancer Institute, Pediatric Oncology/BMT, Boston, USA; 7Dana Farber / Boston Children Cancer Institute, Nursing Department, Boston, USA; 8Dana Farber / Boston Children Cancer Institute, Pediatric Oncology / Neuroncology, Boston, USA; 9Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt CCHE 57357, Nursing Department, Cairo, Egypt Background/Objectives: Children diagnosed with cancer in low and middleincome countries (LMIC) have inferior outcomes compared to those in high income countries. While some of these issues can be resource availability, a major problem is the quality of training and traditional methods of clinical practice where decision making is centered on the most senior person on the team. To ensure real change, highlytrained locally based specialists with a strong emphasis on problemsolving and critical thinking using evidencebased approaches are needed. Design/Methods: The Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt (CCHE57357) and DanaFarber Boston Children's Hospital (DFBCH) at Harvard Medical School developed a 30 month pediatric oncology fellowship training program following the American Academy of Pediatrics fellowship guidelines.The primary objective of the program was to implement a shared education model to develop highly educated physicians who are able to follow evidencebased approaches and committed to sustained practice in LMIC. Results: DFBCH staff provide ongoing education to the fellows through visits to CCHE57357 every 23 months, weekly video sessions with the fellows for case presentation and journal clubs, and weekly conference calls with the fellowship program staff to ensure that the goals and objectives for each fellow and the program are met.Each of the current 15 fellows spend 6 weeks/year in Boston participating in evidencebased multidisciplinary based rounds; the remainder of the curriculum takes place at CCHE57357 and incorporates an array of individual, small group and elearning modules specifically created for the program. Three classes of fellows have been enrolled and the senior class will graduate in spring of 2017. Conclusions: Training of fellows following the same standards as those applied to North American candidates is feasible and has the potential to advance the quality of education and expertise in LMIC. By focusing on the education of the next generation of clinicians, the opportunity to implement many of the important principles of clinical care can be realized. P-543 Presentation of Children with Cancer to a Pediatric Oncology Unit in Mangaluru, India H. Lashkari 1, R. Shenoy2, Kamath3, Hospital Manipal University, Pediatrics, College Hospital College Medical College, Pediatrics, Mangalore, India Background/Objectives: It is essential to know the routes of presentation and time prior to diagnosis in primary and secondary care to avoid delay in diagnosis which plays an important role in better survival strategy in childhood cancers.To describe average time taken for a child with cancer to present and to get diagnosed in an oncology unit. Design/Methods: It is retrospective cohort study of children diagnosed with cancer between the 1st Jan 2014 and 31st Dec 2016 at Pediatric oncology unit, KMC Hospital Mangalore, India. Time to presentation (TTP) was defined as time from initial symptoms to time seen by a pediatrician. Time to diagnosis (TTD) was defined as time from initial symptoms to diagnosis at our pediatric oncology unit. Patient pathways to diagnosis were mapped and routes for different cancers were compared. Results: Total 148 children were registered with childhood cancer during this period. The data of 104 children aged between 0 to 16 yrs diagnosed during this period were collected. The majority of them were boys (68). Acute leukemia was diagnosed in 67 cases and TTP varied between 2 to 45 days. Nearly two third (40/67) presented within 2 weeks of onset of symptoms. The TTD varied between 7 to 180 days with mean of 36 days in leukemia group. In solid tumor group TTP was 1 to 60 days, whereas TTD varied between 8 to 105 days with an average of 42 days. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) with skeletal manifestations had longest TTD (180 days). Lymphoma had TTD of 105 days with TTP of 45 days. Conclusions: The majority of children diagnosed with cancer presented via referral from pediatricians, with the route varying between tumor types.This is part of ongoing study which is looking into the challenges in diagnosing cancer, identifying a wide range of nondisease related factors potentially delaying the diagnosis. P-544 The Pediatric East African Clinical Oncology Consortium (PEACOC) J. Lubega 1, P. Scanlan2 1Uganda Cancer Institute, Pediatric Oncology, Kampala, Uganda; 2Muhimbili National Hospital, Pediatrics, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania Background/Objectives: The survival of children with cancer in East Africa is poor due to shortages of dedicated and standardized pediatric cancer services, skilled multidisciplinary workforce, and locally appropriate evidencebased pediatric cancer management guidelines. PEACOC is a cooperative group of pediatric cancer centers in the six member states of the East African Community to sustainably improve the outcomes of children with cancer in the region. Design/Methods: PEACOC was created in November 2016 at Ocean Road Cancer Hospital, Dar es Salaam (Tanzania) by the pediatric oncology expert working under the auspices of the East Africa Regional Oncology Center of Excellence that is funded by member state loans from the African Development Bank. The Expert Working Group (EWG) noted the following as the topmost challenges of pediatric oncology across all centers in East Africa: 1) Late presentation of patients with advanced tumors and with lifethreatening complications; 2) Inconsistent access to chemotherapy; 3) Poor access to blood products for transfusion; 4) Poor access to radiotherapy; 5) Lack of local evidencebased treatment and supportive care guidelines; 6) Lack of dedicated infrastructure and personnel. To foster regional collaboration and sharing resources, the EWG agreed to form PEACOC to include all pediatric cancer units in East Africa and various international collaborators. Results: PEACOC will evaluate current pediatric cancer units in East Africa including treatment guidelines, tumorspecific epidemiology, care funding, research activity, tertiary and specialist skills development. The Consortium will then adapt current regional practices to best international practices to develop guidelines for the region. Conclusions: PEACOC will conduct cooperative group clinical trials, establish a harmonized regional pediatric cancer registry, conduct pediatric cancer training programs, and benchmark quality of pediatric cancer care in the region. P-545 Strategic Planning for Expansion: Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt 57357 F. Makka 1, B. Lee2, I. Albanti3 1Harvard University School of Public Health, Health Management, Boston, USA; 2Harvard University School of Public Health, Global Health, Boston, USA; 3Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Global Health Institute, Boston, USA Background/Objectives: Pediatric cancer is a global health problem. While lowand middleincome countries (LMIC) plan to initiate or expand pediatric oncology services, guidance from published literature is limited due to its focus on highincome countries and academic medical centers. As the largest pediatric oncology hospital in the world, the Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt (CCHE) strives to provide free care to all without discrimination. High demand has pushed CCHE to start the process of expanding its space and services. Our project explored the expansion strategy at CCHE while considering its local context, with the goal of creating a generalizable resource for other LMIC to reference. Design/Methods: We used qualitative research methods in the form of indepth Interviews with 24 key informants, including members of senior management, staff at CCHE and community members. The interviews were conducted over two weeks in January 2017, with each session lasting 4560 minutes. Findings were structured into a process map, a stakeholder analysis, a SWOT analysis, and a final report. Results: CCHE faces many challenges in its progress, from the flotation of the Egyptian currency to spatial restrictions of its expansion. Throughout the interviews, we identified several major attributes that were instrumental in helping them overcome these barriers: visionary leadership, strong international collaborations, early investment in external consultants to bring in worldclass best practices, and an emphasis on extensive planning. Conclusions: Many of the challenges present in the CCHE expansion are also likely to be faced by other pediatric oncology facilities in LMIC seeking to expand their own pediatric oncology units. We believe that such facilities may benefit from the findings of our study. P-546 The Slovak Clinical Cancer Registry of Children and Adolescents: Rationale, Organization and Incidence in Years 20002012 M. Makohusov\u00e1 1,2,3, E. Kaiserov\u00e11, A. E. Oncology, Bratislava, Slovak Republic; 2International Agency for Cancer, Section of Cancer Surveillance, Lyon, France; 3University of SS. Cyril and Methodius, Department of Chemistry Faculty of Natural Sciences, Trnava, Slovak Republic; 4Children's University Hospital Slovak Hematology and Oncology, Kosice, Slovak Republic Background/Objectives: The aim of the study was to report on the cancer incidence and time trends in children and adolescents (agerange 019) registered in the Slovak Clinical Cancer Registry of Children and Adolescents during the period 20002012. Design/Methods: The data are collected from three regional pediatric treatment centers. All malignant, some benign and borderline malignancies were included. This populationbased cancer registry with national coverage records detailed clinical information on diagnosis, treatment and followup of patients. The tumours were classified using International Classification of Childhood Cancer, edition 3. Official population figures were used to calculate incidence rates. Results: In 20002012, 2,071 cases were registered (agerange 019 years). For the agerange 014 (N=1,626), the agestandardized (World standard) annual incidence rate (ASR) was 144.6 per million personyears; the most frequent the highest among infants (239.3; N=171), lower at age 14 N=424), 1014 years (116.1; lowest at age 1519 years (86.0; N=445). The average annual increase over the study period in the age 014 was 1.68% (P=0.01) overall and increased for neuroblastoma by 6.66% (P=0.02). Conclusions: Observed incidence rates for children aged 014 years are comparable with those reported from countries of Eastern Europe and from the National cancer registry of Slovakia (NOR). The low rate reported for adolescents is due to data incompleteness. Continuous monitoring of the time trends is needed. For the future, it is important to put in place a mechanism of data exchange with the national registry for cancers of all ages (NOR), to improve data quality and completeness in both sources and provide reliable and detailed data for research and public health.

Matsumoto 1, T. Takimoto2, A. Saito3, A. Oara4, K. Horibe3, E. Hiyama5 1National Center for Child Health and Development, Children's Cancer Center, Tokyo, Japan; 2National Center for Child Health and Development, Clinical Epidemiology Research Center for Pediatric Cancer, Tokyo, Japan; 3National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Clinical Research Center, Nagoya, Japan; 4Toho University School of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Tokyo, Japan; 5Hiroshima University, Department of Pediatric Surgery, Hiroshima, Japan Background/Objectives: In Japan there used to exist about 200 hospitals that cared childhood cancer arising about 2500 patients yearly. In 2013, with the aim of further integration and to provide uniform accessibility to pediatric cancer treatment, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare elected 15 core hospitals in seven regional blocks in Japan. The aim of this study is to determine the demographic profile of childhood cancer patients in Japan before and after the election of 15 core hospitals. Design/Methods: We collected data from the published registry of the Japanese Society of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, which would cover approximately 80% of the patients with cancer in Japan. The collected data were analyzed to reveal the change before and after the election of the core hospitals. Results: In 2016, there exist 150 hospitals that cared pediatric cancer patients in Japan. Among them, 55% were university hospitals and 10% were children's hospitals. Twentyfive percent of the hospitals that cared more than 20 cases per year (highvolume center) covered 57% of the cancer patients in Japan. The core hospitals were elected from the high volume centers, and covered 32% of pediatric cancer patients. The number of hospitals that could care leukemia/lymphoma patients decreased from 175 in 2012 to 143 in 2015. High volume centers of eukemia/lymphoma covered 23.8% patients in Japan, which was increased from 13.8% before the election of core hospitals. Also, the number of hospitals that could care solid tumors, including brain tumor, decreased from 139 in 2012 to 129 in 2015. The coverage rate of solid tumor patients by high volume centers of solid tumors increased from 31.0% to 41.2%. Conclusions: Integration of the pediatric patients with solid tumors and hematological malignancies is realizing in Japan after the election of 15 core hospitals. P-548 Burden of Pediatric Solid Tumors Management in SouthEast Asia Countries C. Monsereenusorn 1,2, P. Friedrich3, P. Alcasabas4, C. Lam3, C. RodriguezGalindo3 1Phramongkutklao Hospital and College of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Bangkok, Thailand; 2DanaFarber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Department of Pediatric Oncology, Boston MA, USA; 3St.Jude Children's Research Hospital, Department of Global Pediatric Medicine, Memphis TN, USA; 4Philippines General Hospital, Department of Pediatrics, Manila, Philippines Background/Objectives: Pediatric solid tumor treatment require complex multidisciplinary care. The objective of this study is to identify barriers to effective treatment of pediatric solid tumors in SouthEast Asia (SEA) and will inform the development targeted strategies to improve outlook for children with solid tumors in SEA. Design/Methods: Physicians were received an individualized emailspecific link of survey. Questions in the survey included topic: patients, care team, hospital/infrastructure, abandonment and barriers to treatment. Analysis will be done from countries as classified by the World Bank Method as low (LIC), lowmiddle (LMIC), uppermiddle (UMIC), and high income countries (HIC). Results: The survey was sent to 66 physicians. 17 responses (25.8%) from 17 centers (7 countries) had been received. Neuroblastoma is the most common disease that presenting with late presentation in SEA, followed by osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, other soft tissue sarcomas. In terms of laboratory, Methotrexate level is still not available in 50% of centers and 2 countries. More than 50% of solid tumor cases have been encountered with inconclusive diagnosis by pathology. Infection is still a leading cause of death among SEA countries. For surgery, limb sparing surgery is performed in less than 50% of cases, with higher rate in UMIC (P=0.045). However, external prostheses are seldom available, in particular in LMIC (P=0.023). The rate of abandonment was highest for bone tumors, soft tissue sarcomas and neuroblastoma. The most important barriers for solid tumor treatment are financial constraints, followed by commute, infection, abandonment, fear from surgery, radiation and lacking of legal support. Conclusions: Barriers to effective treatment of pediatric solid tumors in SEA are late presentation, limited resources for laboratory and pathology, inadequate supportive care, limited accessibility of limb sparing surgery and prosthesis and treatment abandonment. These results will inform the development of specific strategies to solve these barriers in pediatric solid tumors treatment in SEA. P-549 Evaluation of Maternal and Perinatal Characteristics and Risk of Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis in Texas, 19952011 E. PeckhamGregory C. Allen1, M. Scheurer1, P. Lupo1 1Baylor College of Pediatrics HematologyOncology Section, Houston, USA Background/Objectives: Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a myeloid neoplasia with a median diagnosis age of 30 months. In studies of pediatric malignancies, maternal and perinatal characteristics have been successfully evaluated to determine the impact of inborn variation on disease risk. Therefore, we reviewed populationbased registry data to determine if these factors influence the risk of LCH. Design/Methods: The study population included children with LCH born in Texas (n=164) for the period 19952011 who were identified from the Texas Cancer Registry. Birth certificate controls were randomly selected at a ratio of 10:1 for the same period matched on birth year. We evaluated the impact of factors identified from vital records including: gestational age, birthweight, and parental race/ethnicity. Unconditional logistic regression was used to generate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) evaluating the association between selected factors and the risk of LCH. Results: Overall, nonHispanic Black mothers were less likely to give birth to offspring who developed LCH compared to nonHispanic White (NHW) mothers (aOR: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.241.03). However, Hispanic mothers were at increased risk of giving birth to offspring who developed LCH (aOR: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.072.35). Furthermore, the risk of LCH was stronger among children born from two Hispanic parents compared to children born from two NHW parents (aOR: 1.83; 95% CI: 1.152.90). Mothers born in Mexico versus the U.S. and who resided along the U.S.Mexico border were less likely to give birth to offspring who developed LCH and parental race/ethnicity were strongly associated with LCH risk. Further, mothers who resided along the U.S.Mexico border at time of infant birth, and Mexicoborn mothers, were less likely to give birth to offspring who developed LCH. These findings highlight novel risk factors that warrant assessment in future studies. P-550 Spectrum of Malignancies in Patients with Neurofibromatosis (NF): Experience from the First Greek NFCenter K. Filippidou1, R. A. Kattamis1 1Athens Medical School, Division of Pediatric HematologyOncology First Department of Pediatrics, Athens, Greece; 2Athens Medical School, First Department of Pediatrics, Athens, Greece; 3Athens Medical School, Medical Genetics, Athens, Greece; 4Aghia Hospital, Department of Neurosurgery, Hospital, Radiology Department, Athens, Pathology Department, Greece Background/Objectives: Neurofibromatosis(NF) type1(NF1) and type2(NF2) are distinct geneticclinicalsyndromes in which affected individuals develop both benign and malignant tumors that predominantly affect the nervoussystem. In order to standardize and improve the clinicalcare of patients with NF, the first nationalcenter of reference was established in 1/1/2016. Design/Methods: To describe the spectrum of malignancies in patients with NF examined from January 2016 until February 2017 in our NFreferencecenter. Clinical diagnosis of NF1 was based on NationalInstitutes of Health diagnosticcriteria(NIH,1988), while for NF2 on NationalNeurofibromatosesFoundationCriteria (NNFF,1997). Patients were evaluated from a multidisciplinaryteam including neurologist, dermatologist, oncologist, ophthalmologist as well as psychologist. Geneticcounseling was provided in all the families and regular followup for the patients was arranged. Results: During the studyperiod 51 patients(age 6mo17y, median 8,79y) were examined and included in the analysis. Clinical diagnosis of NF1 had 48 patients, while 3 of NF2. Moleculartesting for NF1 was performed in all the patients, with NF1 confirmed in 27 patients(3 denovomutations), while in 21 patients evaluation is still ongoing. Among the 51 patients, there were 4 families with 2 affected children, while 7 patients were referred due to positive familyhistory. OpticPathwayGliomas(OPGs) were found in 19 patients with NF1(39,6%), of whom 9 had visual deterioration during followup and received chemotherapy. Two siblings with NF1 and OPGs presented with nonreversible blindness. Pilocyticastrocytomas were diagnosed in two patients, located in posteriorfossa and left parietallobe, respectively. Neurofibromas were diagnosed in 4 patients(8.33%), one with plexiformneurofibroma and metastaticmalignantperipheral nervesheathtumor also and one with a large cervical neurofibroma causing mildrespiratory distress. Bilateral vestibularschwannomas causing milddeafness with previous history of two resected meningiomas were observed in two out of three patients with NF2. Indication for oncologic intervention was needed in 27,4% of the patients. Conclusions: Establishment of a MultidisciplinaryCenter for Neurofibromatosis can improve clinicalcare by providing necessary multidimensionalapproach and contributing to early diagnosis and timely therapeutic intervention.

Rykov 1, V. oncology, Moscow, Russia Background/Objectives: The study presents the analysis of the external audit results of the delivery of medical care in children with cancer conducted in the regions of the Russian Federation: Central, NorthWest, NorthCaucasian, Volga and South Federal Districts. Design/Methods: The authors analyzed the clinical histories of children with solid tumors who received specialized treatment in the oncology departments of the Regional Children's Hospitals in the period of 2011-2015, and evaluate the available equipment and existing competence of the staff. Results: The study revealed 374 patients (194 (51.9%) boys and 180 (48.1%) girls) aged 0 17 years (mean age 5.4 years) with malignant tumors. The number of hospitalizations 1534, the total number of patient days 22762, average 14.8. Patients with I stage of disease 23 (6.1%), with II 112 (30%), with III 89 (23.9%) and with IV 146 (39%), with an unknown stage 4 (1%). Clinical guidelines have been violated in the treatment of 46 (12.3%) patients. Conclusions: It seems reasonable to develop recommendations that justify the expediency of the individual stages of the treatment of patients in different regions of the Russian Federation in accordance with their distance from the federal center, the size and density, as well as the incidence of child population in order to ensure optimal routing of patients and improve the Commission. It is also necessary to strengthen the oncology alertness of primary care physicians (pediatricians) for early detection of cancer, including during routine inspections. P-552 Duration Between the First Symptom and Exact Diagnosis Time in Childhood Cancer B. Sevinir 1, M. Demirkaya1, M. Ertekin1, G. Kalay1 1Uludag University Medical Faculty, Pediatric Oncology, BURSA, Turkey Background/Objectives: Early diagnosis promotes prognosis in childhood cancers.Our aim is to evaluate the duration between the first symptom and exact diagnosis time in children diagnosed as lymphomas or solid tumors. Design/Methods: The data of 759 patients applied to Uluda University Medical Faculty Department of Pediatric Oncology who diagnosed as lymphoma or solid tumor during January 2005 to November 2014 was retrospectively analysed.The time from the first complaints to the apply of a physician,the time from admission to get a diagnose and total time from the first complaints to the final diagnosis were determined.These datas were compared with age, sex and diagnosis. Results: Median age was 84 months.The most common diagnosis were lymphomas(22%), brain tumors (18.3%) and germ cell tumors (10.8%). The patients' were firstly apply to 67.5% pediatricians, 5.3% general practitioners, 29% other specialties. Median time of the duration between the first admission was 15 days. Median time of the referral of the patient to the oncology centers is 8 days and median diagnose time of the patients was 10 days. Median time between the onset of symptoms and the final diagnosis was 55 days (31254 days). The first admission time of the thyroid carcinomas (p=0.001) were more than 15 days. The first admission time of the patients were significantly less than 15 days who diagnosed neuroblastoma (p=0.001), renal tumors(p=0.005) and hepatoblastomas (p=0.016). The referral patients with Hodgkin's lymphomas (p=0.003) and osteosarcomas (p=0.016) were more than 8 days.The admission time was longer than 15 days in adolescent patients.Time to diagnosis was longer in patients who addmited to physians other than pediatricians or pediatric surgeons(p=0.024). Conclusions: In our study the referral and diagnose times are prolonged especially the physicians who rarely examine children. P-553 A Comprehensive Model for Developing a Pediatric Cancer Health System in Ethiopia: A FiveYear Experience A. Shad 1, J. Broas2, S. J. Pediatrics Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Baltimore, USA; 2The Aslan Project, NonProfit Organization, Washington DC, USA; 3Wilmot Cancer Institute - University of Rochester Medical Center, Pediatrics Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Rochester, USA; 4Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital, Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Hospital, Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Jimma, Ethiopia; 6St. Children's Research Hospital, Global Pediatric Medicine, Memphis, USA; 7Newark Beth Israel Medical Center, Pediatric Hematology/Oncology ret., Newark, USA; 8The Hospital for Sick Children, Haematology/Oncology, Toronto, Canada; 9School of Nursing - University of California San Francisco, Physiological Nursing, San Francisco, USA Background/Objectives: In 2012, despite an estimated 6,000 cases of pediatric cancer annually, Ethiopia had no qualified pediatric oncologists, pediatric oncology nurses, or oncology pharmacists and no dedicated infrastructure. Children with cancer were intermixed with the general pediatrics population and palliative care/pain medications were rarely offered during treatment. To address these issues, The Aslan Project, a US nongovernmental organization (NGO), introduced a pilot project for building a pediatric cancer system at Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital (TASH) in 2012. In 2015, with St. Jude's support, Aslan opened a second Ethiopian site, Jimma University Specialized Hospital (JUSH), serving an area of 15 million people with no prior pediatric oncology capacity. Design/Methods: Aslan's model focuses on human resource (HR) capacity building (fellowship training), infrastructure development, and family/psychosocial support. Initially, at TASH, Aslan provided nearly full financial support for the project. At JUSH, Aslan refined its model to enhance local partner ownership and improve HR training through partnerships with highfunctioning LMIC institutions. Aslan prioritizes advocacy and relationship building with the Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH). Results: The TASH unit is robust; in November 2016, it had 729 patient visits collectively on in and outpatient service, and family support has reduced treatment abandonment substantially. JUSH has treated 50+ children since August 2016 and administered 600+ doses of chemotherapy with no significant error. The FMOH has prioritized childhood cancer, forming a National Task Force for Pediatric Cancer, and WHO, SIOP, and CCI are engaged within the country. Other Ethiopian hospitals have adopted Aslan's model, and training continues in all specialties. Conclusions: Full engagement of all stakeholders - the government, major institutions, and NGOs - is critical, largely through building of trust and joint ownership of the project. Continual refinement of the model is necessary to adapt to the needs/capacity of partner institutions. Aslan's model may be replicated successfully within other LMICs. P-554 Launching Pointe: Use of Branding and Social Media to Promote Pediatric Oncology Education and Training Opportunities J. Slone 1, M. Zobeck1, J. Libes2, R. Children's Hospital, Pediatrics, Houston, USA; 2University of Illinois College of Medicine, Pediatrics, Peoria, USA; 3Arkansas Children's Hospital, Pediatrics, Little Rock, USA; 4Thomson United Kingdom; 5University of the Witwatersrand Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital, Faculty of Health Sciences, Johannesburg, South Africa Background/Objectives: Training a pediatric oncology workforce is essential to providing optimal treatment to children with cancer in low and middleincome countries (LMICs). While training opportunities exist, information on them is often difficult to find. In an effort to promote global childhood cancer education, we aimed to improve upon a previous initiative to consolidate information for providers by developing a new and enhanced web site with a social media campaign to increase awareness. Design/Methods: The International Society of Paediatric OncologyPaediatric Oncology in Developing Countries Education and Training Working Group (SIOPPODC ET WG) launched an online database of training programs in October 2014. To better engage stakeholders, the site was rebranded as the Paediatric Oncology International Network for Training and Education (POINTE) and launched a new website at www.cancerpointe.com. A social media campaign on Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn accompanied the new site's launch in October 2016. Google Analytics was utilized to monitor website traffic and reach of both sites. Results: In the first five months after www.cancerpointe.com was launched, page views increased compared to the same time period of the initial site by 53% (5051 vs. 3291) and the site was accessed from 13 more countries (95 countries vs. 82 previously). With a social media campaign that included 320 Facebook likes and 58 Twitter followers in the first five months, social media referrals accounted for 13.9% of referrals to the new site. Without a similar campaign, only 1.8% of traffic of the first site originated from social media. Conclusions: Rebranding and launching a social media campaign has effectively increased web traffic and exposed new training opportunities to healthcare providers in LMICs. While data is lacking regarding impact on patient care, we believe this initiative and the programs added to the site have the ability to greatly improve the quality of education and training. P-555 Causes of Death In Pediatric Cancer Patients in Mexico L. VelascoHidalgo 1, M. ZapataTarr\u00e9s1, F. Arregu\u00ednGonz\u00e1lez2, M\u00e9dico Nacional Mexico Background/Objectives: Worldwide a higher survival rate is reported in pediatric patients with cancer, due to: early diagnosis, better support treatment and early detection of complications. In a middle income country like Mexico, the mortality of pediatric patients with cancer is still high. Design/Methods: The aim was to know the frequency and the main causes of death in pediatric patients with cancer registered in three public health institutions in Mexico from January 2007 to December 2015. Results: Two thousand three hundred twentyseven patients were registered in the study period, of which 378 (16.4%) died. One hundred and twenty patients were diagnosed with leukemia and the rest with solid tumors. Fiftythree point fifteen percent were male. In patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the treatment phase with the highest number of deaths was in induction (48%), and the main cause of death was toxicity (58.1%). In patients with solid tumors the treatment phase in which the highest number of deaths occurred was neoadjuvance. 44% died from toxicity and 23% from disease progression. There were 437 toxicity events in 258 patients with solid tumors, of which 14.6% of the patients had septic shock as the cause of death. The time of diagnosis to death in patients with leukemia was 18.4 months compared to patients with solid tumors where it was 13.49 months (P=0.04) Conclusions: Most patients with acute leukemia who die are secondary to toxicity in the induction phase. The main cause of death in patients with solid tumors is toxicity and disease progression. Mortality in patients with solid tumors occurs earlier. Particular attention should be paid to the early detection of complications, to avoid mortality from these causes in a middle income country. P-556 Pediatric Cancer Treatment Abandonment in Botswana: A Lower than Expected Abandonment Rate M. Zobeck 1, T. Gilliland2, A. Slone1, P. of Medicine, Pediatrics, USA; 2Baylor College of Medicine, Pediatrics, Houston, USA; 3Princess Marina Hospital, Pediatrics, Gaborone, Botswana Background/Objectives: Pediatric cancer treatment abandonment (TA) is a major cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in low and middleincome countries (LMICs). Recent publications estimate that SubSaharan Africa (SSA) has an average TA of 28%, but few comprehensive hospitalbased studies have been published. TA for Botswana has not been measured previously. Our objective was to determine the prevalence of TA for pediatric cancer patients at the tertiary referral center in Botswana and investigate predisposing factors for TA from the available literature. Design/Methods: Since 2007, the Botswana Ministry of Health and Wellness has partnered with Baylor College of Medicine/Texas Children's Hospital to operate the only pediatric hematologyoncology program in the country at Princess Marina Hospital (PMH). We analyzed data from the Botswana Pediatric Oncology Database for children diagnosed with a malignancy at PMH between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2015. Results: Of the 185 patients in the cohort, seven met criteria for abandonment (3.8%) and two (1.1%) had abandonment as their final outcome. Of those who abandoned, four (57.1%) of the patients were female, five (71.4%) had solid tumors including two (28.6%) osteosarcomas and two teratomas. Median time to abandonment from diagnosis was 9.14 weeks. No statistically significant risk factors for TA were identified, including living outside the capital city, possessing private medical aid, HIV status, metastases at diagnosis, and solid tumor outside the central nervous system. Conclusions: It was found that the TA at PMH in Botswana is low compared to a recently published average of estimated TA of SSA countries, although precise comparison is difficult due to the limited data available for the region. More research is needed at the hospital and country levels to better quantify the magnitude of the problem and to facilitate intercountry comparisons that explore the regional and national risk factors for TA at a given center. Late Effects P-557 Renal Dysfunction in Survivors of Egyptian Children with Solid Tumors E.R. Abdel Khalek 1, L. Sherief2, M. Almalky3, N. Khalifa4, M. Abdel 1Faculty Zagazig University, MedicineZagazig University, Clinical Pathology, Zagazig, Egypt Background/Objectives: Pediatric cancer survivors have a ninefold risk to renal injury compared to healthy children. Little is known about longterm renal dysfunction in this vulnerable group. The aim of this work is to detect early chronic Kidney dysfunction (CKD) in Survivors of Egyptian Children with Solid Tumors in order to prevent any developing renal impairment. Design/Methods: We investigated 50 children (aged 315 years) cured from different solid tumors, 1 to 4 years after ending the treatment. Twenty healthy age and sexmatching children were added as a control group. All participants were subjected to history taking, physical assessment, and laboratory investigations including urine analysis, serum creatinine, and BUN. Estimated glomerular filtration rates (GFR) were calculated and chronic kidney disease was diagnosed accordingly. In addition, serum CystatinC (CysC) and neutrophilgelatinaseassociated Lipocalin (NGAL) were determined. of solid tumors showed evidence of subclinical CKD as compared to the control group after an average of 2.1 years after cessation of therapy. The creatinine level between cases and control was insignificant (p022). The (GFR) has a median of 95.87 versus 120.55 (mL/min/1.73 m2) (p0.006), serum CystatinC of 0.99 versus 0.75 mg/l (p0.025). NGAL level has a median of 381 versus 225 pg. /ml for the control group. There is a significant positive correlation between serum CysC and serum NGAL. (p< (p0.006) with (GFR) Conclusions: Subclinical renal could be found in survivors. Both NGAL and cystatin C altogether connected with measured GFR. They have a higher diagnostic accuracy than serum creatinine in discriminating normal from an early stage of renal injury. Reassessment of the renal function in survivors can help us to promote the health of the Survivors. P-558 Survivor's Assistance Program: Continuing Psychological Support for Children and Young Adults after the Completion of their Cancer Treatment H. Anis 1, A. Dhaliwal1, K. Bhattacharya1 1CanKids... Kidscan, Pediatric Psychooncology Program, New Delhi, India Background/Objectives: Cancer is a significant stressor for patients and their families but after the completion of their treatment, some survivors, siblings and caregivers develop persistent traumatic stress reactions. Experiencing these posttraumatic stress symptoms is often part of the process of coming to terms with a lifethreatening event,some survivors and their parents, however, require more intensive therapeutic interventions and approaches to reenter in the society with enhanced psychological adjustment and emotional wellbeing. Design/Methods: In May 2016 Cankids has initiated a Survivor's Assistance Program which aims to identify, understand and rectify the unique needs and challenges of survivors and their parents that reduces the experience of trauma and issues of survivorship. This program is a combination of special interventions that provide the survivors and their caregivers in distress with oneonone therapeutic interventions and Sharing and Caring Sessions to enhance their psychological well being. Results: However, survivors reported to possess higher risk of depression, low self esteem, marital and fertility issues, mood swings, acceptance, and some degree of anxiety over the possibility of a recurrence, serious psychiatric disorders such as Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Bipolar Disorder, and Schizophrenia were found to be uncommon. Parents were concerned about relapse, sibling issues and mood swings of the survivors. Based on the pre and post intervention assessment, they reported greater benefits after participating in these cognitive and behavioral stress management interventions and showed positive psychological responses such as less anxiety and fear, enhanced selfesteem, greater feelings of relief, peacefulness and purposefulness in their lives. Conclusions: It must be recognized that cancer survivors do appear to possess slightly higher risk for major depression and other psychological complications which continues to exist across the survivorship trajectory.This kind of ongoing cognitive and behavioural stress management interventions not only helps in identifying issues but also resolves the psychological complications related to surviviorship for positive outcomes. P-559 Creation of a Survivorship Clinic for Oncology Pediatric Patients in Medical National Center 20 De Noviembre Issste, A Third Level Hospital in Mexico City F. Arreguin 1, B. Alma2, Noviembre, Pediatric Oncology, Mexico, Mexico Background/Objectives: Over the last 30 years the survival rate in childhood cancer has improved all around the world. Currently, eight of every ten children will survive 5 years beyond their diagnosis, but they will have adverse healthrelated and qualityoflife outcomes as a sequealae of their cancer treatment. The ISSSTE (Institute of Security and Social Service for State Workers) is a third level institute in Mexico city that takes care of 11% of Mexico`s total population and the Medical National Center 20 de Noviembre (CMN 20 de Noviembre) is the main reference hospital for ISSSTE\u00b4S cancer pediatric patients. We receive around 120 new cases/year. In March 2016 we created the first Survivorship Pediatric Cancer Clinic as a national strategy for these vulnerable population. Design/Methods: CMN 20 de Noviembre is the main reference third level hospital for adults and children with severe conditions, so there is a complete routine health care clinicians of all medical specialties. We implemented a riskbased model based on the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study adjusted to a low income country and opened Mexico\u00b4s first Surveillance Clinic for pediatric cancer patients. Results: We recluted 128 cancer survivors, with a female predominance (71% vs 57%). Adolescents were the most frequent group (1417 years old). The most common late effects were altered pituitary disfunction, overweight and obesity, metabolic syndrome, neurocognitive deficits, disfunction, infertility, neurosensory deficits and renal insufficiency Conclusions: The ideal approach to childhood cancer survivor care involves a riskbased model with routine health care and a personalized plan of surveillance. It is difficult in a low income country to do this follow up so we need to strengthen the relation with primary care doctors, follow practice guidelines for early detection of cancer treatment morbidity and work with expertise groups in order to maximize quality of life outcomes. More data is needed. P-560 Sarcopenic Obesity in Long Term Survivors of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) R. Barr 1, T. Farncombe2, L. Beaumont3, A. Cranston4, Health Canada; 3McMaster University, Nuclear Medicine, HamiltonOntario, Canada; 4Hamilton Health Sciences, Pediatrics, Hamilton, Canada Background/Objectives: Sarcopenic obesity (a gain in fat mass with loss of leanespecially skeletal musclemass) has been reported to occur early in the treatment of ALL, and ascribed mainly to the influence of glucocorticosteroids. This apparent paradox risks the double jeopardy of the metabolic and frailty syndromes during survivorship, with the associated adverse effects on overall health and survival that result from the added burdens of morbidity and premature aging. We sought to determine whether this clinical phenotype persists in long term survivors. Design/Methods: A cohort of 75 adolescents and young adults, who were more than 10 years from diagnosis, were enrolled in a study of bone health and body composition*. All had been treated on Dana Farber Cancer Institute protocols. Measures of fat mass, lean body mass, appendicular lean mass (ALM) and their corresponding indices (I=mass/height2) were provided by dual energy Xray absorptiometry (Hologic Discovery A model) which also gave values for bone mineral content and density. Skeletal muscle mass (SMM) was derived from the equation SMM (kg) = (1.19 \u00d7 ALM [kg])1.65. Results: On the basis of the fat mass index (FMI) 68% of the females and 88% of the males were overweight or obese (the obese proportions being 15% and 21% respectively). All but one subject had a low SMM. Based on a positive Z score for FMI and a negative Z score for ALMI, 44% of the subjects met the definition of sarcopenic obesity (discordance between fat mass and lean mass). Conclusions: Sarcopenic obesity is prevalent in long term survivors of ALL. Given the attendant risks of premature aging and mortality, this finding offers encouragement to research into prevention and amelioration of the clinical phenotype, so improving overall health and extending survival. *Barr R et al.

Vora3, Centre, Radiation Oncology, India; 2Tata Memorial Centre, Medical Physics, Mumbai, India; 3Tata Memorial Centre, Pediatric Oncology, Mumbai, India; 4Tata Memorial Centre, Radiodiagnosis, Mumbai, India; 5Tata Memorial Centre, Nuclear Medicine, Mumbai, India; 6Tata Memorial Centre, Pathology, Mumbai, India; 7Tata Memorial Centre, Oncology, Mumbai, India; 8Tata Memorial Centre, Radiation Oncology/ Palliative Medicine, Mumbai, India Background/Objectives: To evaluate sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) in children with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) treated with intensitymodulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and cisplatin based chemotherapy (CTh). Design/Methods: From 2005 to 2015, 95 children with NPC were treated with neoadjuvant cisplatin based CTh followed by IMRT to nasopharynx (70.2Gy/33fr) and neck nodal regions and adjuvant CTh, and evaluated for late auditory toxicity in the form of SNHL. Post treatment audiograms were available for 33 children (66 ears). A total of 55 pure tone audiograms more than 6 months post RT were evaluated retrospectively and the SNHL grade noted on a scale of 0 to IV according to SIOP ototoxicity criteria. Chemotherapy doses and mean cochlear doses were analysed for association with grade III/IV ototoxicity. Results: The median audiological followup was 24 months. observed in 45(68.2%), 6(9.1%), 9(13.6%) and 6(9.1%) ears respectively, with grade III/IV accounting for 22.7% of cases. All except three of our patients received a cumulative cisplatin dose of 400mg/m2, and no threshold cisplatin dose was observed to correlate with ototoxicity. The average cochlear Dmean was 54.6\u00b110 Gy. patients who developed grade III/IV SNHL it was 57.8\u00b18.2Gy. Using the Pearson Chi Square test a cochlear Dmean threshold of >58 Gy was observed to be associated with higher incidence of developing grade III/IV SNHL (p=0.045), while the dose of 45Gy failed to show any significant association (p=0.24). Conclusions: Severe ototoxicity was seen in 22.7% of ears in children receiving radiation and chemotherapy and was significantly more in those receiving a mean cochlear dose of more than 58 Gy. Suggested thresholds for radiation doses to cochlea and cumulative cisplatin doses, from adult studies, may not be applicable in paediatric population. Prospective studies are required to determine the cochlear tolerance doses in children. P-562 The Effect of Vitamin D Levels and Fok 1 VDR Gene Polymorphism on Long Term Bone Health in Pediatric Cancer Survivors N. \u00c7eting\u00fcl1, Z. \u00d6nder Sivi 1, S. \u00d6zen2, S. Medicine, Pediatric Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Pediatric Endocrinology, University Faculty of Medicine, Medical Genetics, Izmir, Turkey; 4Ege University Faculty of Medicine, Nuclear Medicine, Izmir, Turkey Background/Objectives: 25Hydroxyvitamin D (25OH D) insufficiency is common in healthy children and adolescents, with the prevalence being %1449 in the general population. Survivors of childhood cancer are at increased risk for a variety of adverse medical outcomes. Potential risk factors for imparied 25OH D status in this population include poor diet, exposure to chemotherapy, steroids, radiotherapy. Vitamin D performs its effect via the nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR), which shows an extensive polymorphism. We studied the frequencies of the Fok 1 VDR gene polymorphism and the status of 25OH D and their correlation with bone mineral density (BMD). Design/Methods: This study included 100 pediatric cancer survivors in the Ege University, Dept. of Pediatric Oncology. All of them were subjected to full history taking and clinical examination. The peripheral venous blood were took from each patient for genomic DNA extraction (Fok 1 gene), serum 25OH D, alkaline phosphatase, parathormone levels and urine calcium/creatine and measured bone mineral density (BMD). Fok 1 gene polymorphism results were compared with a control group of Turkish healthy people. Results: The diagnosis of patients was 28% leukemia, 31% lymphoma, and 41 % solid tumor. Median age of patients at cancer diagnosis was 7.8 years, during to the study was 16.9 years. In 72% of the patients were patients 25OH D insufficient and deficient. The Fok 1 gene polymorphism was found in 54% of them. In 44% of BMD measure was osteopenia and osteoporosis. Patients with solid tumors were most affected, despite of their lack of routine exposure to steroids. Conclusions: In pediatric cancer survivors the frequency of Fok 1 gene polymorphism was similar to control group. The prevalance of 25OH D insufficiency and deficiency in cancer survivors were high according to general population. Prospective studies evaluating on long term bone health in survivors of cancers are required. P-563 Life Threatening and Fatal Late Effects in Long Term Survivors of Childhood CancerData from after Completion of Treatment (ACT) Clinic G. Chinnaswamy 1, M. Prasad1, V. Dhamankar1, T. Vora1, G. Narula1, P. Kurkure1, S. Banavali1 1Tata Memorial Hospital, Department of Pediatric and Medical Oncology, Mumbai, India Background/Objectives: Long term survivors of childhood cancer(CCSs) are known to have a higher prevalence of life threatening and fatal health conditions(NCI CTCAE grade 4/5) compared to the normal population. These include second malignant neoplasms(SMN), benign second neoplasms(SN) and late recurrences. Although these have been described in large cohorts from the US and Europe, no data is available from LMIC. Design/Methods: A total of 1838 CCSs have been enrolled into the After Completion of Therapy(ACT) clinic of our hospital since 1991. Survivors are kept under follow up based on primary disease, treatment received and expected long term toxicities. Data regarding SMN/SN, recurrences and deaths was obtained from the database. Results: 1838 CCSs with a median age of 18 years(553) have been followed up over a median duration 10 years(540). Nearly 50% are lost to long term followup at various stages. 91(5%) CCSs were detected to have grade 4/5 toxicities37 late recurrences, 33 SMN, 14 SN and additional 7 deaths. The commonest tumors to have late recurrences are Hodgkin lymphoma(HL), ALL and Ewing sarcoma, mean time to recurrence being 7.3 years, multiple recurrences in some and high subsequent mortality (>30%). The most common SMNs were carcinomas of thyroid and parotid, others being Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma., with mean time to develop being 13.2 years(338). The commonest SNs were schwannomas and meningiomas and in ALL and HL survivors. There were 22 documented deaths3 due to late organ toxicities(renal failure, cardiac failure and moyamoya disease),10 following recurrence, 5 in SMN and 4 unrelated deaths(Rheumatic heart disease, accident, malaria and dengue). Conclusions: With increasing survival there is a need for long term surveillance of CCSs for both late recurrences and second malignancies. Ascertaining the true number of these very long term toxicities needs rigorous follow up, which is a challenge given the health system network in LMICs. P-564 Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccination Rates Among Childhood Cancer Survivors in South Texas L. Embry 1, A. Brennan2, A. Shay3, A. Grimes1 1UTHSCSA, Antonio MS4, San Antonio TX, USA; 3UT Health School of Public Health in San Antonio, Department of Health Promotion & Behavioral Sciences, San Antonio, USA Background/Objectives: Initiatives targeting uptake of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination improved rates nationally, however HPVrelated diseases remain a significant health concern. Although childhood cancer survivors are at increased risk for HPVrelated disease (particularly those with a history of stem cell transplantation (SCT) or radiation therapy), they are not a targeted group in populationbased initiatives. In South Texas, HPV vaccination uptake is among the lowest in the state. Study aims included evaluation of (1) HPV vaccination rates among pediatric cancer survivors in South Texas, and (2) demographic and clinical factors associated with HPV vaccine uptake in this population. Design/Methods: Retrospective chart reviews of 210 childhood cancer survivors identified patients who were potentially eligible to receive HPV vaccination from 2006 through 2016. Review of vaccine records through Texas ImmTrac vaccine registry and electronic clinical records verified HPV vaccination status. Demographic and clinical variables collected included DOB, gender, race/ethnicity, cancer diagnosis, and cancer treatment. Results: Of 210 records reviewed, 156 survivors were deemed vaccineeligible. Of these, 21 (13.5%) received at least one vaccine, but only 9 (5.7%) completed the 3dose series. Of the 84 females, 19% initiated with 10.7% completing the series. However among the 72 males, only 6.9% initiated with no completions. Approximately 76% of the sample was Hispanic/Latino. Among them, 17 patients initiated the vaccine series but only 7 completed. Rates of initiation and completion were also low in white and black patients. Furthermore, patients who received highrisk therapies (radiation, SCT) did not have increased uptake of the HPV vaccine compared to patients receiving only chemotherapy. Conclusions: HPV vaccination rates among childhood cancer survivors in South Texas is lower than in the general population, both regionally and nationally. Given the increased susceptibility to secondary HPVrelated malignancies, this study demonstrates a clear need for enhanced efforts to increase HPV vaccination rates in this atrisk population. P-565 Investigating the Mechanisms of Methotrexate Neurotoxicity in Patients with Childhood Leukemia and LongTerm Survivors V. Forster 1, J. CarrWilkinson2, D. Tweddle2, S. S. Choufani1, W. Rosanna1, F. Van Delft2 1Peter Gilgan Centre for Research and Learning The Hospital for Sick Children, Genetics and Genome Biology, Toronto, Canada; 2Newcastle University, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: Adverse neurological events are common (420%) during treatment for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and include seizures, stroke like syndrome and leukoencephalopathy. In addition, chronic neurotoxicity is emerging as a worrying late effect of treatment with longterm survivors experiencing decreased executive function, processing speed and memory function. Survivors are also at increased risk of experiencing learning difficulties, social withdrawal issues and inattention hyperactivity disorders. Methotrexate, an antifolate chemotherapy agent, is a mainstay of pediatric leukemia treatment regimens globally and is widely implicated as a cause of these neurological side effects. We hypothesise that methotrexate disrupts DNA methylation via effects on Sadenosyl methionine, a key methylation component that has previously been described to be involved in regulation of genes involved in myelination. Design/Methods: Using both neural cell lines and oligodendrocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) treated with methotrexate, we assayed for changes in DNA methylation and consequential effects on gene expression using wholegenome methylation arrays and RNAseq, respectively. Genes with corresponding methylation and expression changes were selected for confirmation of expression by realtime qPCR and assessment of protein levels. Results: We identified methylation and concomitant expression changes in genes involved in neurodevelopmental pathways and neurological disorders. Of particular interest was dosedependent demethylation and consequential increase in gene expression of IRS1, a vital component of insulin signalling pathways, highly expressed in neural tissue and implicated in regulating cognitive performance. We also detected altered methylation within the PLP1 gene, which encodes the most major protein component of myelin. We identified that increased PLP1 methylation after methotrexate treatment in iPSCderived oligodendrocytes resulted in a corresponding reduction in PLP1 transcript levels and PLP1 protein. Conclusions: Our work provides insight regarding the biological mechanisms behind methotrexateinduced neurological side effects, implicating altered insulin signalling and myelination pathways as potential causative factors in neurotoxicity. P-566 Mental Health of Long Term Survivors of Childhood and Young Adult Cancer A.J. Friend 1, R. Feltbower1, A. Glaser1, E. Hughes2, K. of Medicine, Southampton, United Kingdom; 3St George's University of London, School of Medicine, London, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: Survivors of young people's cancer are known to have increased risk of psychological distress including cognitive difficulties, however little is known about emotional and behavioural problems. We aimed to collate evidence of the prevalence of mental health problems in longterm survivors of childhood cancer. Design/Methods: A standard systematic review was performed,excluding papers on cognitive function. We searched the PubMed, Embase/OVID, CINAHL and Web of Science databases using the following strategy: (child OR children OR childhood OR teen OR teenage* OR adolescent* OR \"young adult\") AND (cancer OR leukaemia OR tumour tumor) survivor AND \"Mental \"long term\" John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. This article is being made freely available through PubMed Central as part of the COVID-19 public health emergency response. It can be used for unrestricted research re-use and analysis in any form or by any means with acknowledgement of the original source, for the duration of the public health emergency. Results: Initial search results returned over 1500 papers, after discarding papers covering cognitive function and those exploring interventions rather than prevalence, 324 papers remained. We found reports of increased antidepressant use and higher rates of psychological distress in long term survivors of CYP's cancer compared to controls, although many of these were siblings of survivors, who are likely to have their own difficulties.The majority of data came from selfreports, which are associated with high risk of bias. There was also data from hospital admissions for mental health problems and analysis of prescribing data from primary care. We found no papers reporting on primary carediagnosed mental health problems, despite this being the most common place for mental illness to be diagnosed and treated in many settings. Conclusions: There is a need to more accurately ascertain the prevalence of mental health problems in this group. Data from primary care would significantly improve our understanding of this issue. This would be essential for future service planning. We hope our future work linking primary care records to cancer registries will go some way to addressing this gap in knowledge. P-567 Pharmacogenetic Analysis of Treatment-Related Toxicities for Hepatoblastoma Patients in E. Hiyama 1, S. Kuriahra1, M. Kawashima1, Y. Hospital, Peditric Surgery, Hiroshima, Japan; 2Hiroshima University, Natural Science Center for Basic Research and Development, Hiroshima, Japan; 3Kure Medical Center, Peditric Surgery, Kure, Japan Background/Objectives: Cisplatin and anthracycline are the most widely used anticancer agents against hepatoblastoma (HB). The Japanese Study Group for Pediatric Liver Tumor (JPLT)2 study (19992012) was to evaluate the efficacy of cisplatin/pirarubicin (CITA regimen) for HB. Avoidance of treatmentrelated ototoxicity, cardiotoxicity, and secondary malignancy effects is important to improve longterm outcomes for childhood HB. Design/Methods: In JPLT2 study, 360 HB children were eligible for inclusion. Among them, we evaluated late effects including ototoxicity, cardiotoxicity, maldevelopment and secondary malignancy in survived cases. Among them, in 186 patients whose germline DNA samples were available under informed consent, genotyping was performed using the Illumina Human Omni selection strategy was 60 used to identify a minimal set of informative variants. Associations between SNPs and toxicities were assessed using logistic regression. Ototoxicity was determined by audiometry and/or auditory brainstem response. Cardiotoxicity was mainly determined by standardized echocardiography. Results: Among the 186 survived cases tested these SNP analysis, 64 ototoxicity, 17 cardiotoxicity, 36 maldevelopment and 8 secondary malignancies were determined. The dose of cisplatin and/or pirarubicin seemed to be correlated with their occurrence but not significantly. We identified inherited genetic variations in three SNPs including 6 SNPs including ACYP2 associated with ototoxicity and in two SNPs associated with cardiotoxicity. Moreover, we find out candidates of genetic variations correlated with maldevelopment or secondary malignancy. Conclusions: The risk variant in these SNPs strongly predisposed these patients to toxicities including ototoxicity and cardiac toxicity using chemotherapy. These results point to new biology underlying the late toxic effects of palatinum/anthoracyclin agents. We should pay biological assessment for next protocol avoiding these toxic effects of chemotherapeutic agents. P-568 Rare Outcomes Encountered In the Care of Childhood Cancer Survivors: Piloting a Methodology to Create Clinical Practice Guidelines L.B. Kenney 1, B. Ames2, D. Oncology, 4Boston Children's Hospital, Neurology, Boston, USA Background/Objectives: Many of the clinical issues encountered in the longterm followup care of childhood cancer survivors are unique to this population. Studies investigating management of these outcomes are often not available. We piloted a consensusbased, modified Delphiapproach methodology to develop regional guidelines for the care of survivors and to identify areas of clinical disagreement. Design/Methods: Members of the Consortium for New England Childhood Cancer Survivors (CONNECCS) were surveyed to identify clinical challenges encountered in care of survivors. Five vignettes on neurologic outcomes were developed based on most frequent clinical issues described. A purposeful sample of 30 was chosen to represent specialty and general physicians from geographically diverse CONNECCS institutions. A systematic review of the medical literature to identify risk factors and interventions was completed; a summary of evidence was made available to participants. A modified Delphi approach required three rounds of anonymous survey data collection to establish practice norms and systematically build consensus among expert participants. Results: All 30 participants completed the round 1 survey with 25 openended questions addressing practice norms related to 5 clinical scenarios. Responses were coded and a modal management option for each question was described. The round 2 survey asked participants to agree/disagree with the modal management options and to provide rational for their responses. All 30 responded. Of the 25 management questions, participants reached consensus on 3 (>90% agreement), conditional agreement on 11 (>90%), and disagreement on 11 (>10%). Round 3 questionnaire attempts to negotiate consensus in areas of disagreement by sharing summarizes of rationale provided by participants for their management decisions. Conclusions: Regional experts can be successfully recruited and retained to develop clinical practice guidelines to manage rare outcomes encountered in the care of childhood cancer survivors using a modified Delphi methodology. Areas where management is controversial can be identified for further research. P-569 Radiation Associated Pulmonary Diffusion, Restrictive and Obstructive Abnormalities as a Function of Age in Pediatric Cancer Survivors F. Khan 1, A. Williams2, D. Weiner3, S. Dhakal4, L. Constine4 1University of Rochester, School of Medicine, Rochester, USA; 2University of Rochester, James P Wilmot Cancer Center, Rochester, USA; 3Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, Pediatric Pulmonology, Pittsburgh, USA; 4University of Rochester, Radiation Oncology, Rochester, USA Background/Objectives: Pulmonary dysfunction is a prevalent and potentially debilitating late effect of radiation therapy (RT) used to treat children with cancer. We postulated that age, as a surrogate for respiratory developmental status, might be associated with vulnerability to pulmonary injury. Design/Methods: Sixtyone children treated at our institution with lung radiation who had undergone pulmonary function testing (PFT) between 19952016 were analyzed. Data collection included age at treatment (radiation, chemotherapy, surgery), radiation dose and location, spirometry and plethysmography results. PFTs were normalized according to age, gender, height, and ethnicity and transformed into standardized zscores. Obstructive disease was defined as zFEV1/FVC<1.645, restrictive as zTLC<1.645 and abnormal diffusion as zDLCO<1.645. We determined the incidence of obstructive, restrictive, or diffusion abnormalities in our population and estimated the relative risk of developing pulmonary abnormalities. Results: At a mean age of 24 years (range 1231) and time from diagnosis of 9 years (range 120), the cumulative incidence of any pulmonary abnormality was 34.4%. The incidence of diffusion abnormalities, obstructive, and restrictive disease was 19.6%, 18% and 8.1% respectively. Those <5 years and 513 years at RT had more diffusing, restrictive, and obstructive abnormalities than those >13 years. Compared to patients >13 years, those <5 years and 513 years at RT had a significantly increased risk of an abnormal PFT as follows: OR 7.71 1.06, 11.57) respectively, p<0.035, although statistical significance was lost after adjustment for bleomycin use and time since RT. Further, this association remained when examining each type of abnormality (p>0.05). Conclusions: Pulmonary function abnormalities were common among our cohort of childhood cancer survivors treated with lung radiation. Diffusion and obstructive disease were more common than restrictive disease. Younger age at treatment is associated with an increasing risk of developing pulmonary dysfunction, presumably due to developmental immaturity. P-570 Vision Loss in Pediatric Oncology Due to NF1, Retinoblastoma and Childhood Brain Tumors. Recommendations for Psychological Intervention J. Korzeniewska 1, B. Dembowska Bagiska1 1The Children's Memorial Health Institute, Pediatric Oncology, Warsaw, Poland Background/Objectives: Vision loss in context of pediatric oncology is due to neurofibromatosis (NF1), retinoblastoma or brain tumors. In which cases vision loss could be partial or total, occurs immediately or as a progressive disease, touch children in various ages and level of development. Symptoms of vision loss are variable and determine different ways of early intervention and psychological support. Design/Methods: Whole oncological population in our center we search for vision deficits and assessed their special needs, determined by specific mechanism of sensory loss. We prepared recommendation for psychological procedures, including: challenges in the assessment of this population, the most effective vision functional assessment, psychological early rehabilitation and stimulation, psychological support for parents in decisions making about their child's treatment, rehabilitation and education. Results: As a dynamic disease NF1 causes progression of optic pathway gliomas and decreasing vision ability. Symptoms and grade of vision loss due to childhood brain tumors depend on localization of lesion, e.g. posterior fossa tumor - double vision, strabismus, nystagmus; lobe risk of total vision loss; occipital lobe - cortical visual impairment (CVI) or total vision loss (legal blindness); chiasma of optic nerves - hemianopia, loss of peripheral vision (tunnel vision). In our sample we observed also that relation between localization of brain damage (as a consequence of tumors) and vision loss is complex and mechanism is not clear. Retinoblastoma as a progressive disease caused gradual vision loss. Patients are adapted to this limitation and do not show significant behavior disturbances as the consequences of lack of sight. Child is too small to give feedback how is sighing. Same behaviors and reactions connected to vision loss are misdiagnosed, delayed diagnose and confused caregivers. Conclusions: Vision impairment in oncological population is specific and requires special psychological procedures and early intervention, started at the time of treatment. P-571 Physical Activity Behavior in Children and Adolescents Before, During and After Cancer Treatment M. Neu 1, S. St\u00f6ssel1, V. Rustler2, J. Faber1 1University Medical Center Mainz, Center for Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology/Hemostaseology, Mainz, Germany; 2German Sport University Cologne, Institute of Cardiovascular Research and Sports Medicine Department of Molecular and Cellular Sport Medicine, Cologne, Germany; 3Leipzig University Hospital, Department of Pediatric Oncology Hematology and Hemostaseology, Leipzig, Germany; 4University of Heidelberg, Institute of Sport and Sport Science, Heidelberg, Germany; 5University Hospital of Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine Center of Integrated Oncology K\u00f6ln Bonn, Cologne, Germany Background/Objectives: Childhood Cancer is associated with various disease and treatmentrelated sequelae on physical, psychological and social levels. Previous studies showed reduced physical activity levels in survivors after childhood cancer treatment (CCT) which may have considerable impact on child development, quality of life, social participation and cardiovascular health. The aim of this study was to evaluate physical activity behavior (PA) in children and adolescents before, during and after intensive CCT. Design/Methods: In this prospective multicenter study, 114 children and adolescents formerly treated for any type of cancer were enrolled (mean age 11.7 (4.1719.7) years). PA was assessed after completion of intensive treatment phase (time since diagnosis 3.7 (0.614) years) using an adapted version of the PA questionnaire from the German KiGGSStudy. The questionnaire included items asking for the level and intensity of PA before and during CCT, and at time of study participation, i.e. after completion of intensive CCT. Results were compared to 37 healthy controls (mean age 11.9 (5.417.3) years). Results: Compared to time before CCT, patients reported significantly lower PA levels during and after CCT, evaluated by a visual analog scale (p<0.05). Healthy controls reported higher PA levels than patients after CCT (p<0.05). Time of PA spent at a low intensity level was lower after CCT than before (p<0.05). 31.1% of patients did not participate in sport club activities before CCT and 51.1% after CCT whereas 2.7% of healthy controls did not participate. Conclusions: In conclusion, children and adolescents treated for cancer report modified PA behavior during and after CCT in comparison to time before CCT as well as in comparison to healthy controls. Further studies are needed to investigate the consequences of physical inactivity during and after CCT and to examine subsequently how physical activity behavior can be influenced positively. P-572 Neuropsychological Outcome of Different Treatments for Young Children with Medulloblastoma, Ependymoma and PNET: Multicenter Wuerzburg Children\u00b4s Center Mainfranken, Wuerzburg, Germany; 3Cleveland USA; 4University Germany; Oncology, Hamburg, Germany; 6University of Essen, Pediatrics III Oncology, Essen, Germany; 7University Hospital of Geneva, Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine Division of Pediatric Oncology, Geneva, Switzerland; Refenrence Center, Wuerzburg, of Leipzig, Department of Radiotherapy, Leipzig, Germany; 12University of Bonn, Department of Pediatric Oncology, Bonn, Germany Background/Objectives: Background: Medulloblastoma (MB), Ependymoma (ED) and Primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET) in young children in are associated with an unfavorable mental outcome after multimodal treatment. Therefore, craniospinal radiotherapy (CSI) is often delayed or replaced by intrathecal methotrexate (MTXi.th) and systemic Chemotherapy (CHT). Design/Methods: Procedures: Between October 2007 and March 2017 n = 327 surviving children treated within the HIT 2000 protocol at age of < 4 years were prospectively assessed by two neuropsychologist from the Wuerzburg team. The following tests were systematically applied: Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children (KABC) measuring the Mental Processing Composite (MPC), the Coloured Progressive Matrices (CPM), the Developmental Test of Visual Motor Integration (VMI), the Tapping Test (TP) und der Continuous Performance Test (CPTK). Data of n = 206 patients were included in this analysis. Results: Results Children were stratified according to diagnosis (MB, ED, PNET), Mstatus (M0, M+) and clinical response. The average IQ of all patients was: MPC IQ 84.96; SD 1.63. However, the values differed largely among the various treatment groups. As examples, the results of MB M+ patients (treated with systemic chemotherapy and the following RT) are shown: DMB M+ good responder no responder MPC IQ EP local RT, MPC IQ 97 EP III infratentorial local RT, MPC IQ 93 Interestingly, patients with infratentorial ED were found to have a KABC within normal age range. Conclusions: Conclusions In this longitudinal assessment of the HIT 200 cohort, we found that multimodal therapy without CSI in MB patients resulted in improved mental outcome as measured by KABC. This neuropsychological followup project was supported by the German Childhood Cancer Foundation. P-573 Dose Metrics and Memory Performance in Children Treated for Brain Tumor K. Raghubar 1, M. Lamba2, K. Cecil3, K. Yeates4, E.M. Mahone5, Ris1 1Baylor College of Medicine, Pediatrics, Houston, USA; 2University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Radiation Oncology, Cincinnati, USA; 3University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Radiology, Cincinnati, USA; 4Hotchkiss Brain Institute University of Calgary, Psychology, Calgary, Canada; 5Kennedy Krieger Institute, Neuropsychology, Baltimore, USA Background/Objectives: Advances in radiation oncology provide new opportunities to study neurocognitive outcomes of radiation therapy (RT) in pediatric patients treated for brain tumor. Specifically, these advances allow for the consideration of the multidimensionality inherent to individualized RT treatment planning when examining the relationship between RT and neurocognitive outcomes. The present study investigates the relationship between biophysical and physical dose metrics, as well as their relation to neurocognitive ability, namely learning and memory. Design/Methods: This study is based on a subsample (n = 20) of participants from a longitudinal, prospective, multisite study (BRISC: Brain Radiation Investigative Study Consortium). Participants included in this study were diagnosed between the ages of 5 and 16 years and received RT following surgical intervention. Detailed dose reconstruction metrics were collected, and results from neuropsychological evaluations completed on average 29 months posttreatment are reported. Physical (mean dose, prescribed dose, max dose) and biophysical (generalized equivalent uniform dose, integral biological effective dose) dose metrics for the whole brain, and right and left hippocampus were evaluated and correlated with learning and memory subtests from the Children's Memory Scale. Results: Biophysical dose metrics were highly correlated with the physical metric of mean dose (all Spearman's correlations > .82) but not prescribed dose. Although prescribed dose was uncorrelated with measures of learning and memory, biophysical metrics and mean dose correlated with most measures; and lateralizing findings were obtained. Conclusions: These preliminary findings suggest limited advantage of biophysical dose metrics over physical metrics of mean dose when calculated for specific regions of brain. Implications for evaluating and understanding the relation between RT and neurocognitive functioning are discussed. P-574 The Risk of Subsequent Malignancies Among Survivors of Pediatric Thyroid Cancer W.M. cancer HospitalEgypt57357, Research, Cairo, 2Armed Forces College of Medicine, Research, Cairo, Egypt; 3Charit\u00e9Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, Medicine, Berlin, Germany Background/Objectives: Thyroid carcinoma is a very rare tumor in pediatric, it accounts for only 3% of all newly diagnosed childhood carcinomas in the United States according to the SEER database. The incidence rates of thyroid carcinoma of children from 0 - 4 years of age is 0.4 per 100 000, and up to 1.5 per 100 000 for adolescents aged from 15 to19 years. It was reported from large cohort studies that thyroid carcinoma is associated with an increased risk of second primary malignancies after treatment. We aim to assess the risk of subsequent malignancies among survivors of pediatric thyroid cancer. Design/Methods: We used US SEER (Surveillance Research Program, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA) database to perform this study. SEER*STAT version 8.3.4 was used to extract data from SEER publicuse database. The cohort for this analysis consisted of pediatric cancer patients aged less than 20 years diagnosed with a primary thyroid cancer and identified by site code ICD03: C739, reported to a SEER 9 database between 1973 and 2013 To identify subsequent malignancies in this population, a query was performed to obtain all additional records of a new tumor diagnosis for each patient. Subsequent malignancies occurring 5 years or more after the original thyroid cancer diagnosis were included except thyroid cancer as a second malignancy. Results: A total of 38 patients diagnosed primarily with thyroid carcinoma with 42 incidence of subsequent malignancies as 4 patients developed third malignancy. Females represents 89.4% while males represent 10.5%. The subsequent malignancies of pediatric cancer survivors diagnosed with thyroid cancer includes many sites but high percent in both Female breast (21.3%) and Salivary gland (13.2%). Conclusions: Thyroid cancer is a rare tumor in childhood. The risk of developing second malignancy between pediatric cancer survivors mandates the presence of precise plan of longer followup. P-575 Cardiovascular Function in Adult Survivors of Pediatric Cancer I. Schmid 1, B. Reiner2, J. M\u00fcller2, A. 2Deutsches Herzzentrum M\u00fcnchen and Institute of Preventive Pediatrics Technical University of Munich, Department of Pediatric Cardiology and Congenital Heart Disease, Munich, Germany; 3Deutsches Herzzentrum M\u00fcnchen Technical University of Munich, Department of Pediatric Cardiology and Congenital Heart Disease, Munich, Germany; 4Institute of Preventive Pediatrics Technical University of Munich, Department of Pediatric Cardiology and Congenital Heart Disease, Munich, Germany Background/Objectives: Adult survivors of pediatric cancer are at high risk developing late cardiovascular events. The most important risk factor is the cumulative dose of anthracycline therapy. The goal of this prospective study was to detect any alterations regarding vascular structure, function and exercise capacity based on the dose of anthracyclines given. Design/Methods: 51 survivors of pediatric cancer (25 male) diagnosed at a median age of 12 years were examined at an average age of 22 years (1643 y) between 03/2015 and 01/2017. Patients with a cumulative dose of >250 mg/m\u00b2 anthracyclines were compared to patients with 100250 mg/m\u00b2 anthracyclines. All patients were asymptomatic and in NYHA class 1. To quantify dysfunction of the left ventricle, ejection fraction (EF) was determined by echocardiography. As cardiac biomarker, the plasma Nterminal probrain natriuretic protein (NTproBNP) level was measured. In addition, cardiopulmonary exercise test was performed to detect limitations in exercise capacity. Results: EF was reduced (EF <55%) in 17% of male and 16% of female survivors. There was no difference between the groups with high and moderate anthracycline dosage. NTproBNP was elevated (NTproBNP >100 ng/ml) in 20% of male and in 46% of female survivors. NTproBNP was significantly higher in the group with high compared to the group with moderate anthracyclines (p=0.03). There was no association between NTproBNP and EF. Cardiopulmonary exercise capacity was significantly lower in the group with high than with moderate anthracycline dosage (p=0.005). Conclusions: EF, NTproBNP levels and cardiopulmonary exercise tests are important parameters to detect early impairment of cardiovascular function in asymptomatic survivors of childhood cancer. Irene Schmid and Barbara Reiner contributed equally to this work. P-576 Late Effects of Treatment in Survivors of Childhood Cancers: Experience from India R. Seth 1, S. Seth2, A. Singh1, S. Sapra1 1ALl India Institute of Medical Sciences, Pediatrics, Delhi, India; 2ALl India Institute of Medical Sciences, Cardiology, Delhi, India Background/Objectives: Background: With improved survival of childhood cancer, longterm cancer survivors are increasing. Few studies have assessed the longterm morbidity after childhood cancer treatment in developing countries. Objectives: To study the prevalence and spectrum of late effects of cancer treatment in pediatric cancer survivors. Design/Methods: Methodology: Evaluation of the first 300 patients who completed 5 years of followup in the after treatment completion clinic was done. Details of primary diagnosis, treatment received and current clinical status was noted. The spectrum of late effects was ascertained by appropriate investigations. Results: Hematological malignancies comprised 25% of total cases.Commonest primary diagnosis comprised acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), retinoblastoma and Hodgkin lymphoma. The median age at evaluation and followup were 14 years and 8.5 years respectively. 23% (69) of the survivors had a minimal disability (growth retardation or underweight), 13% (39) had moderate disabilities needing medical attention (HbSAg positive, myocardial dysfunction, Azoospermia and hypothyroidism) while 2 % (1) had major/ life threatening disabilities (mental retardation, liver disease, mortality). Eleven patients relapsed on followup: of these five patients expired. Two second malignancies were recorded in our cohort of patients during the period of followup. Conclusions: Late effects are a concern however severe disability (grade 35) is seen in only 2% survivors: most can be tackled. Lifelong followup of childhood cancer survivors is recommended to define accurately cancerrelated morbidity, occurrence of a secondary neoplasm, facilitate timely diagnosis and implement remedial or preventive interventions that optimise health outcomes.. Awareness towards the existence of late effects of cancer therapy is required among parents, patients and health professionals P-577 Subsequent Glioma in Survivors of Paediatric Neoplasms L. Radiotherapy, St. Petersburg, of Division of Neurooncology, Moscow, Research Center of Pathology Department, Moscow, Russia; 4N.N. Burdenko Neurosurgical Institute Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, Division of Pathology, Moscow, Russia; 5Paediatric Hospital of Consultation Department, of NeuroOncology, Moscow, Russia Background/Objectives: Multimodal therapy has improved survival for most childhood tumours.The development of neoplasms subsequent to therapeutic cranial irradiation is a rare but serious and potentially fatal complication. Design/Methods: The analysis included 16 patients (pts) with subsequent glioblastoma (SG) from several institutions who underwent cranial or neck irradiation (1 case) to treat their primary disease (acute lymphoblastic leukaemia 12 pts, medulloblastoma 2 pts, choroid plexus papilloma 1 pt, lymphoma 1 pt.). All gliomas arose within the previous radiation fields and satisfied the widely used criteria for the definition of radiation induced neoplasms. The median RT dose administered was 18 Gy with the dosage ranges being 1236 Gy. Total body irradiation(TBI) was used in one patient with Phpositive ALL during bone marrow transplantation. Median latency period was 7 years until diagnosis of SG. The majority of SG (13 of 16 [81%]) occurred during the initial 9 years of followup, only 3 were diagnosed after 10 years. Patients underwent surgery resection followed by standard fractionated local radiation and chemotherapy. Results: A KaplanMeier analysis was used to illustrate the overall survival (OS) curves. OS rate was 37.5\u00b112.9% and 15.0\u00b19.7% at 1 and 2 years respectively. Conclusions: In case that paediatric neoplasms are treated by standard fractionated radiation or TBI is used, radiationinduced gliomas should be considered as possible longterm side effect. And the patients should be followed for a long term, even longer after the period of risk for relapse of the primary cancer has passed. P-578 The ApoE Genotype and White Matter Lesions in Childhood NonCNS Tumor Survivors C. Sleurs 1, J. Lemiere1, G. Vercruysse1, Vandenwyngaert1, cholesterol transporter, playing an important role in neuronal plasticity. Given the lack of evidence about neurodevelopment in childhood cancer patients, this study aims to explore potential brain lesions in survivors and the link with cognition and the ApoE4 allele. Design/Methods: We acquired neurocognitive data for survivors of solid nonCNS tumors (n=34) and agematched controls (n=34) [1635] years. Patients were treated since 2000. Neuropsychological assessments included intelligence, verbal and auditory memory, attentional measures. T2*weighted FLAIR images were investigated for white matter lesions. DNA samples were examined for the ApoE polymorphism. First, we compared behavioral scores on objective assessments (WAIS, AVLT, RVDLT, ANT) and subjective questionnaires (STAI, CFQ, BRIEF), with depression (BDI) and SES as covariates. The risk for white matter lesions within the patient group was predicted by the ApoE genotype (i.e. by the presence vs. absence of allele 2 and 4). Cognitive scores within the patient group were compared between the Apo4 patient subgroups, as well as between the white matter lesion (present vs. absent) subgroups. Results: Cognitive scores appeared lower for WAIS working memory (F=6.314, p=.015). WM lesions were present in 23.5% of patients (vs. .02% of controls). The risk of WM lesions predicted by the Apo4 allele, resulted in a correct categorization of 37.5% as lesion patient (Model: \u00b2= 8.708, p=.003). Neither of both factors were related to cognition. Conclusions: Survivors of solid tumors mainly complain about working memory, and also showed lower objective scores for processing speed, visual memory and QoL. The heterogeneity of WM lesions suggest that the impact on cognition is different, depending on the location and type of lesion. The ApoE genotype could be a potential biomarker for such lesions. P-579 Sonographic Image of Solitary Kidney in Wilms Tumor Survivors J. Stefanowicz 1, M. Kosiak2, E. AdamkiewiczDroyska3, A. Balcerska2, A. Kurylak4 Oncology, Gdask, Poland; 2Medical of Paediatrics and Oncology, Poland Background/Objectives: Study presents analysis of sonographic and laboratory parameters of solitary kidneys and prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in Wilms tumor survivors (WTs). Design/Methods: 53 WTs who completed treatment for Wilms tumor (WT) and 44 healthy individuals were enrolled to the study. Study protocol consists of: completing medical history, sonographic examination of solitary kidney, estimation of glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) with Schwartz or MDRD formula, albumin urine excretion (ACR), blood pressure measurement. Results: Sonographic sings of kidney damage were observed in 21 (39,6%) WTs. Hypertrophy of solitary kidney occurred in 71,7% of cases. Mean volume of solitary kidney was 77% of volume of sum of two kidneys in control group. Mean eGFR in WTs group was 117 \u00b1 19,5 ml/min/1,73m2 vs 131 \u00b1 12,8 ml/min/1,73m\u00b2 in Six WTs (11,3%) of eGFR below 90ml/min/1,73m2. Increased albumin urine excretion (ACR > 30mg/g) was observed in 7 WTs ( 13,2%) and in 3 (6,8%) individuals in control group. Conclusions: Sonographic image of solitary kidney in WTs differs from sonographic image in control group. The most frequently detected abnormality are hyperechoic rings around renal pyramids. There was no difference in sonographic image of solitary kidney according to chemotherapy. Sonographic examination in WTs ought to be performed not only to detect eventual tumor recurrence but also to assess risk of CKD and progressive deterioration of renal function.

Childhood Cancer International (CCI) P-580 Family Members' Perceptions Towards Equity and Quality in Accessing Health Care Services at Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt: A Mixed Methods Study M. Alattas 1, A. Hamdy2, S. Elmeniawy2, A. Elhaddad3, A. Abdelfattah3, M. Zamzam4, I. Albanti5 1Boston University School of Public Health, Global Health, Boston, USA; 2Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt 57357, Quality, Cairo, Egypt; Hospital Egypt 57357, Pediatric Oncology, Cairo, Egypt; 4Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt 57357, Healthcare Sciences Academy, Cairo, Egypt; 5Dana Farber Cancer Institute, The Global Health Initiative, Boston, USA Background/Objectives: Patients' experience within the health care system in terms of equity and quality influences their perception to access. This project explores the referral mechanism at Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt 57357 (CCHE) in Cairo and assesses perceptions of family members towards equity, quality, and other dimensions associated with access to pediatric oncology care. Design/Methods: This is a single site mixed methods study. Data were collected through indepth interviews using a structured interview guide which included probes, closeended and openended questions. A sample size of 100 family members were randomly selected and interviewed. A focus group with 5 mothers and 1 father was conducted to expand on parents' opinion on the referral process and overall experience. Results: Respondents reported the following factors when deciding to seek care at CCHE 1) Experience outside CCHE: Dissatisfaction with healthcare providers' knowledge, attitudes and behaviors; fragmented system; and under equipped hospitals. 2) Perceived quality of CCHE services: Advanced, specialized facility; effective treatment; high survival rate. 3) Reputation of CCHE: Trust in CCHE and brand awareness (word of mouth, television ads, doctors' recommendations). 4) Equity: CCHE's mission for equal access and free of charge treatment. Conclusions: Efficient patient centred referral process is a vital element of high quality care service. Our recommendations include suggestions to increase engagement of families into care, incorporate family members' feedback into quality improvement efforts, collaborate with national existing cancer centers to streamline the referral system and access, plan an outreach program for health care providers in rural areas to improve their communication skills, conduct followup surveys to expand on the public perception towards different access elements. P-581 The Cost of Childhood Cancer Treatment in Jordan I. Sultan 1, A. AlNassan1, A. Mansour2, S. Gupta3, S. Horton4, N. Bhakta5 1King Hussein Cancer Center, Department of Pediatrics, Amman, Jordan; 2King Hussein Cancer Center, Department of Radiology, Amman, Jordan; 3Hospital for Sick Children, Division of Hematology/ Oncology, Toronto, Canada; 4University of Waterloo School of Public Health and Health Systems, Global Health Economics, Ontario, Canada; 5St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Department of Global Pediatric Medicine, Memphis, USA Background/Objectives: Over the past 15 years, King Hussein Cancer Center (KHCC) has established a multidisciplinary cancer care program and become an important regional hub for oncology. Each year, the center treats over 3500 new cancer patients from both Jordan and its surrounding regions. KHCC provides stateoftheart medical equipment and services, including 8 operating rooms, 170 beds, and 18 intensive care units, including 6 dedicated pediatric ICU beds. Emerging data from KHCC has shown outcomes for many pediatric malignancies treated by the hospital are approaching those seen in highincome countries (HICs). The cost of childhood cancer treatment in upper middleincome countries (UMIC) like Jordan, however, has not been well investigated. The aim of this research is to determine the cost of operating a national childhood cancer treatment center in Jordan to help prioritize future interventions for childhood cancer treatment and provide an analytic framework to model future costing analyses elsewhere. Design/Methods: We will conduct a crosssectional study to evaluate the expenses of childhood cancer treatment covered by the budget and financing model in Jordan. Expenditures will be categorized by Personnel, Room and Board, Outpatient Clinic, Pharmacy, Pathology, Surgery, Radiation, and Imaging. To estimate the unit cost per bed, we will multiply the World Health Organization table of unit costs for a Tertiary Hospital, the average length of stay at KHCC (days) and the total number of inpatient visits per year. Results: We will calculate total costs based on annual cases diagnosed and admitted at KHCC. Costeffectiveness will be assessed by comparing costs with DisabilityAdjusted LifeYears estimated from centerspecific outcomes data. Conclusions: Both the cost and costeffectiveness results of this study will inform policy makers and other stakeholders in Jordan with planning, implementation and prioritization for childhood cancer treatment programs. The described methods also provide a template for other UMICs to conduct similar analyses. P-582 Building an Advocacy Campaign \"Go Gold India\" for Childhood Cancer to be a Child Health Priority in India K. Chawla 1, P. Bagai1, S. Sharma2, Delhi, India; 2CanKids...Kidscan, Parent & Survivor Group, Delhi, India; 3CanKids...Kidscan, CEPAA and Resource Mobilization, Delhi, India; 4CanKids...Kidscan, CEPAA & KCK, Delhi, India Background/Objectives: No childhood cancer control plan or policy in India. Survival outcomes estimated to be as low as 2040%. Awareness about childhood cancer, gold color, gold ribbon and gold glow as symbols was low. A focused advocacy campaign with a brand and to adopt new themes each year was built, to promote Gold color as brand, just as pink is for Breast cancer thereby engaging all stakeholders. Design/Methods: Go Gold India campaign launched in 2015 invoking Childhood Cancer international hash tag \"Act Now for Kids with Cancer\" with specific theme Taj Goes Gold between February International Childhood Cancer Day (ICCD) and September Childhood Cancer Awareness Month. On ICCD children with cancer decorated Light it up Gold Taj Mahal cut outs in 44 cancer centers lit up by hospital managements. On Nurses and Doctors' Day pediatric oncology professionals pinned with Gold ribbons. On Survivor Day \"I Deserve best cancer treatment, care and support\" poster and essay competition was spearheaded. Spanning 6 months, survivors pinned Gold Ribbons and ran Pledge campaign online and offline. September saw a 5day 1500km Car Rally in Uttar Pradesh and social mobilization campaign to bring children parents and survivors to Agra for Taj to go Gold. The campaign is followed in Year 2 by Go Gold India-for Warriors and Angels inspired by We are one song and using Yellow wristbands. Results: The Taj went Gold from September 2527 adorned with gold ribbons and Light it Up Gold Taj cut outs, first ever Childhood Cancer Exhibition, 1900 children, parents at Taj Mahal and extensive media coverage. 95,000 pledges collected from India and overseas, State Government announced formation of Task Force and WHO India and Central Government Health Ministry pledged support. Conclusions: Sustained and attractive advocacy campaign with strong image and brand needs to be built up year on year to engage stakeholders. P-583 Impact of Early Intensive Nutritional Intervention on Malnutrition Status in Pediatric Cancer -Role of Non Governmental Organisation (NGO) G. Chinnaswamy1, P. Bahl 2, J. Chadha2, K. Bhanushali1, Prasad1, B. Arora1, S. Banavali1 1Tata Memorial Hospital, Department of Pediatric and Medical Oncology, Mumbai, India; 2Cuddles foundation, Cuddles foundation, Mumbai, India Background/Objectives: Preexisting malnutrition in pediatric cancer patients adversely influences treatment outcomes. Additionally, treatment toxicities has a detrimental effect on the nutritional status. Early and aggressive nutritional intervention is found to improve nutritional status and in turn, overall outcomes. We analysed the impact of early intervention on the nutritional status of children across 6 hospitals in India where the nutritional intervention was supported by an NGO. Cuddles Foundation(CF) is the only organization in India that focuses on providing holistic nutritional intervention to children afflicted with cancer. Design/Methods: Children with newly diagnosed cancer, aged 016 years, and with coexisting severe acute malnutrition(SAM) between Jan'2016 to Dec'2016 were included in the study. Weight(for age), Height(for age), Weight for length, BMI, MUAC and Triceps skin fold thickness(TSFT) were measured and their Z scores/percentiles were calculated at baseline, 1st and 3rd month of assessment. Nutritional interventions included incorporating Ready to use therapeutic food(RUTF), other Nutritional supplements including micronutrients (Vitamin D, B12, Folate and Calcium if found deficient) and close monitoring by dedicated nutritionists who were recruited by the NGO. Results: 61 newly diagnosed pediatric cancer children with SAM, were enrolled. Mean age of the study group is 3.4 years and M:F1:1.2. Average BMI improved from 12.3 to 13.22Kg/m2 in 4 weeks. Correspondingly the median Weight shifted from 11.35 to 13.4 kg. Over 3 months, 77% showed an improvement in nutritional status with intervention: 31/61(51%) converted to mild malnutrition/normal nutrition and 16/61(26%) improved to moderate malnutrition status while only 14/61(23%) continued to be SAM. Conclusions: Early and aggressive nutritional intervention in cancer children with preexisting malnutrition significantly improves the nutritional status. This impacts positively on chemotherapy tolerance and long term outcomes. NGOs (CF) focussed on holistic nutritional support can play an important role in improving outcomes in LMICs where malnutrition is highly prevalent in children with cancer. P-584 UNITE2CURE Accelerating Drug Development N. Kick Cancer, Belgium Background/Objectives: There is growing recognition across the parent/patient and professional community that promising new drugs for children and teenagers with cancer are not being developed quickly enough. This is a multifaceted problem that requires an urgent coordinated panEuropean approach. The problem is not just medical but also economic. Pharmaceutical companies consider the adult population their key customer base. Childhood cancers have been neglected as they are made up of rare illnesses, none of which offer a lucrative market for commercially developed drugs. Design/Methods: There are many groups and charities working for similar aims. We aim to provide a parentled platform, that with the Accelerate Platform, will mobilize this support. Under the banner \"Unite Against Childhood and Teenage Cancer, we aim to build upon a growing desire for change in order to save more children with cancer and allow others to access better, kinder new drugs. Our approach will be to work supportively and collaboratively with all stakeholders to share ideas and identify solutions. Together we will amplify the voice of children and teenagers with cancer Results: A few basic changes to European law, as well as collaborative funding ideas could transform the situation and harness the major advances that have been made in biological science for the benefit of children Conclusions: The Paediatric Medicines Regulation promotes research into all children's illnesses. However, with regard to cancer in particular, it has not lived up to the promise it held out to provide them with safe and efficient medicines. Specific reforms to the PMR would ensure that every time a drug company develops a new treatment for adults, the drug's potential for combating childhood illnesses be evaluated. Alternative funding models also should be explored. This would have a significant impact on the health of young people generally, but, in particular, it would benefit those with cancer. P-585 Factors Associated with Abandonment of Pediatric Cancer Treatment in Peru: A Multicenter Cohort Study L. Vasquez 1, R. Chavez2, I. Maza1, E. Peru; Institute of Neoplastic Diseases, Pediatric Oncology, Lima, Peru Background/Objectives: Abandonment is a major cause of treatment failure and poor survival in children with cancer of low and middle income countries; although in our country it is not well documented. The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence and associated factors of treatment abandonment in pediatric patients with cancer. Design/Methods: We have analyzed sociodemographic and clinical data from the two major institutions in Peru in childhood cancer during 2012 to 2014. Definition of treatment abandonment was used from the SIOP (International Society of Paediatric Oncology) PODC (Paediatric Oncology in Developing Countries) Abandonment of Treatment Working Group recommendation. Results: A total of 1135 children diagnosed with malignant solid tumors were retrospectively reviewed and 209 (18.4%) abandoned treatment. Univariate logistic regression analysis showed significant higher abandonment rates in children living in the southern (OR 2.35; p<0.001) and eastern cities of Peru (OR 3.64; p=0.001); prolonged travel time to tertiary center (> 5 hours; OR 2.75, p= 0.002); rural setting (OR 3.44; p<0.001) and lack of parental formal job (OR 4.39; p= 0.001). According to cancer diagnosis, children with retinoblastoma had more abandonment rate (OR 1.79; p= 0.020) compared with other solid tumors. There was a trend of decreasing abandonment rates over time (p=0.004). In multivariate regression analyses, a rural origin and lack of formal parental employment were independently predictive of abandonment. Conclusions: Treatment abandonment prevalence in our country is high and closely related to sociodemographical factors. Outcome could be substantially improved by strategies that help to prevent abandonment of therapy based on these results. P-586 Developing a TieredSystem of Quality of Care Indicators for Pediatric Oncology ResourceLimited Settings C. Wong 1, A. Billett1, P. Friedrich2, C. 1DanaFarber/Boston Center, Pediatric Oncology, Boston, USA; 2St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Global Pediatric Medicine, Memphis, USA Background/Objectives: Consensus is lacking on prioritization (collection, monitoring, and benchmarking) of pediatric oncology (PO) quality of care (QoC) indicators in distinct resource settings. Measurement of resourcespecific indicators that shift from illustrating capacity to reflecting performance in cancer care delivery is needed to assess, identify gaps, and improve QoC. Objectives: To develop a pilot for consensus on a PO tieredsystem of indicators that measures QoC in low and middleincome countries. Design/Methods: Systematic and grey literature review generated potential indicators. A multidisciplinary group of experts reached consensus through a modified Delphi process. Indicators were rated on two consecutive rounds using a 5point Likert scale survey (1=Strongly Agree; 5=Strongly Disagree) based on importance and feasibility for resourcelimited PO settings. For round 3, participants individually categorized indicators applicable for each one of four resourcebased tiers ranging from basic (Tier1) to advanced (Tier4), then ranked a predetermined number of top (60th percentile) indicators for each tier (round 4). Roundtable discussions, review of results, and modification of indicators followed each round. Consensus was reached upon >65% agreement (or median <2) after consecutive rounds. Results: From an initial 107, consensus was reached on 10 top indicators for Tier 1; 28, 33, and 37 for Tiers 24, respectively. Indicators addressed a range of domains including safety, supportive care, treatment abandonment, and longterm survival. Only four indicators were represented across all tiers relating to the proportion of: patients with documented treatment plan available to all providers, handhygiene compliant providers, patients treated according to standardized treatment plans with monitoring of outcomes, and 5 year survival rates. Conclusions: The pilot led to consensus on PO QoC indicators for resourcelimited settings, but these varied across tiers based on resource availability. Validation of the tieredsystem of indicators with a larger group of experts and development of measurement strategies will follow. Other P-587 The Pediatric Hematology Oncology Bestbits Project: A Journal Review and Virtual Journal Club Initiative N. Alexander 1, J. Brzezinski1, N. Waespe1, F. Bellavance2, A. Punnett1 Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Toronto, Canada; 2Hospital for Sick Children, Information services, Toronto, Canada Background/Objectives: Scanning the appropriate journals for relevant articles to stay updated and interpreting the impact of new research is challenging in the expanding field of Pediatric Hematology Oncology. Following a pilot Journal Review Initiative, where 20 fellows participated by screening and appraising relevant articles in 27 journals, writing 155 summaries in 5 issues over 1 year, online expansion was proposed to broaden educational opportunities and participation and facilitate interactive discussions. We aim to create an open access online interactive learning resource of relevant current literature in Pediatric Hematology Oncology and facilitate practice of journal screening, summarizing and critical appraisal. We hypothesize that participation in \"BestBits\" initiative will improve journal reading habits, selfefficacy in screening journals and critically appraising journal articles, and be a convenient way to keep up to date with new literature. Design/Methods: A needs assessment was sent to Pediatric Hematology Oncology fellows and staff across Canada and they were invited to register online to participate in journal review and other learning activities. Following initial design and development of www.bestbits.ca, the first phase of the initiative was launched. A 2month schedule for Journal Review was developed: assigned journals are reviewed and relevant articles to read and appraise, selected using a standardized framework. Summaries with interpretation are submitted online after extensive editorial review and journal review is posted online. Results: Online participant surveys, editorial review and website statistics will be used to evaluate participation and provide feedback on learning activities and processes. We will analyze number of hours and articles read, proportion of articles read completely and selfefficacy in staying updated of the participants. Conclusions: Staying updated with Pediatric Hematology Oncology literature is challenging and creating an open access relevant resource may be useful to practitioners, and promote journal reading and critical appraisal. Further development will involve interactive virtual journal club and selfassessment educational activities. P-588 Development of the First East African Pediatric Hematology Oncology Fellowship Program in Uganda E. Ishigami 1, N. Kagoro2, J. Lubega2, J. Slone2, and Hematology Centers, USA; 2Baylor College of Medicine, Pediatrics, Houston, USA; 3Baylor College of Medicine Children's FoundationUganda, Pediatrics, Kampala, Uganda Background/Objectives: An estimated 300,000 children develop cancer annually. With few trained Pediatric Hematology/Oncology (PHO) experts to provide care in subSaharan Africa (SSA), the majority die. To sustainably improve quality of care in SSA, Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Centers (TXCH), and Baylor College of Medicine International Pediatric AIDS Initiative (BIPAI) partnered with the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Uganda and 3 other Ugandan Partners in 2015 to create the East Africa Pediatric Hematology Oncology Training (EAPHOT) fellowship. Design/Methods: The goal of the EAPHOT fellowship is to increase PHO expert numbers in East Africa. The two year curriculum includes didactics and supervised clinical experience. The program is directed by a fulltime TXCH faculty in Uganda complimented by rotating TXCH faculty. The curriculum includes online lectures together with electronic tracking of each fellow's progress, weekly Tumor Boards with TXCH faculty, a bimonthly leadership seminar, and access to the Texas Medical Center Library. The fellows can utilize the TXCH global consultation system for immediate help with difficult cases. The second year of fellowship focuses on clinical quality improvement and research. Results: As of March 2017, a total of 8 fellows from Uganda, Tanzania, and Kenya, have enrolled in the PHO fellowship program. The online lecture system has been well received. Fellows have accessed the didactic lectures over 111 times. Fellows spend 4 hours weekly reviewing lectures. Positive evaluations of faculty, lectures, and overall fellowship effectiveness were received. The EAPHOT program model has been adopted by Makerere University College of Health Sciences (Kampala) and Uganda Cancer Institute to develop other subspecialty training programs. Conclusions: The program is on track to train and build a critical mass of PHO specialists in the East Africa region and a similar program is planned for Botswana to train pediatric hematologistsoncologists for the Southern Africa region. P-589 Setting Up Strong Core Business Infrastructure to Ensure Sustainability: East Meets West How to Set Up in Developing Countries, Making Programs Sustainable K. WilsonLewis 1, N. Kagoro2, R. Bullock3, E. Ishigami1 1Texas Children's Hospital, Pediatrics, of Pediatrics, Houston, USA; 3Texas Children's Hospital, Cancer and Hematology, Houston, USA Background/Objectives: In an effort to improve the outcomes of children with cancer and blood disorders in developing countries, the Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Centers Global HOPE (Hematology Oncology Pediatric Excellence) program aims to build capacity and strengthen healthcare infrastructure in SubSaharan Africa (SSA). These activities require a significant investment of money, expertise and other resources. Given the level of investment needed, strong business management is critical to the overall success of these efforts. Design/Methods: Methods of business management vary between settings within SSA and those of western partners. Challenges include working in bureaucratic and underresourced government healthcare systems. While understanding that differences exist in business practices and that regulations vary, it is necessary to focus on achieving the highest level of practice possible. To that end, the approach has been to understand local practices and regulations, identify the differences and work with local leadership to strengthen practices where needed. Examples of this strategy include facilities planning and maintenance, financial management, monitoring and evaluation systems (M&E), information systems management and general operational management. This has been accomplished by creating and implementing Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) as a means to clarify process, role, and responsibility and to increase the transparency of business operations. Results: The process of developing SOPs proved helpful in obtaining stakeholder input and support for revised or new processes. Adjustments to existing processes proved challenging but not impossible. To date, outcomes include improved financial reporting and management capabilties, which has increased the confidence of program stakeholders thus, increasing program fundability and sustainability. Additionally, advances in data collection, management and reporting for M&E have been accomplished to add breadth and depth of information for program reporting. Conclusions: Good business practice should be viewed as a requirement of Global Health Programs to ensure program success and sustainability. P-590 Challenges in Managing Grants in Global Settings E. Ishigami 1, N. Kagoro2, L. Morin2, C. Children's Hospital, Pediatrics, Houston, USA; 2Baylor College of Medicine, Pediatrics, Houston, USA Background/Objectives: Grant funding plays a significant role in funding global health. As a center that has quite successfully obtained grant funding, the Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Centers (TXCH) has many years of experience in traditional U.S. based grants management. While this experience has proven helpful to supporting it's rapidly expanding Global HOPE (HematologyOncology Pediatric Excellence) Program, unique challenges have required adapted approaches to grants management in the global setting. Design/Methods: New challenges include the complexity of collaborations across countries, difficulty in longdistance communication, differences in grants management, finance, cash and procurement processes, pace of regulatory processes, and lack of resources at global sites. These challenges were making it difficult for Principal Investigators to accomplish their projects and spend grant funding as planned. For example, executed subawards from a U.S. institution to a global institution were difficult to obtain and challenging to implement due to reimbursement based cash flow practices. To better manage the portfolio of global grants, the TXCH formed a working group with representation of administrative and research leadership, pre and postaward staff, the PI and other key stakeholders to review new grant opportunities and to monitor the progress of awarded grants. Results: This working team has served to overcome many of the challenges through which were making grant funds difficult to spend. For example, clearer communication with the PI and grants managers has helped to overcome roadblocks with subawards, rebudgets and reporting. Dedicating pre and postaward staff increased their project familiarity, thus improving their response times and increasing team morale. A key realization was the need for increased support to PIs with global projects due to operational challenges they face in a global setting. Conclusions: Strong grants management is vital to the success of global health programs, where more grants management and operational support is needed to meet the unique challenges. P-591 Development of the Online Didactic Training Platform for the East African Pediatric Hematology Oncology (PHO) Fellowship Program N. Kagoro 1, Airewele1, K. of Medicine, Pediatrics, Houston, USA; 2Texas Children's Hospital, Pediatrics, Houston, USA Background/Objectives: There is a dire lack of specialists in pediatric oncology in Africa. Literature shows that a significant number of Africanborn physicians migrate to highincome countries to obtain specialist clinical training and few return. The East Africa PHO Fellowship was developed in Uganda to build a critical mass of PHO specialists from Uganda and the East Africa region through formal training and accreditation. The goal of the program was to develop a two-year PHO fellowship curriculum for local limited settings at low cost to ensure program sustainability. To address the lack of local PHO expertise and reduce the cost of sending fellows in a U.S. based institution for training, we integrated an online didactic platform into the PHO Fellowship. This online training comprises of webbased recorded lectures by Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Centers (TXCH)/ Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) exeperts accessible on Blackboard Design/Methods: A committee with African expertise, comprised of pediatric oncologists, hematologists, and psychosociologists, was created to spearhead the process of formatting, reviewing, and adapting lecture content to local settings. TXCH PHO specialists were invited to create lectures covering the curriculum topics that were then edited, reviewed and approved by the committee. Once approved, PHO specialists voice recorded the lectures which were then uploaded as interactive tools onto Blackboard. Results: Twentysix faculty members from TXCH/BCM recorded presentations that were uploaded as part of the curriculum. The fellows were subsequently exposed to numerous PHO specialties. Additionally, by not requiring Houstonbased faculty members to travel to Uganda to present, the program saved an annual expenditure of $260,000 USD. Conclusions: The content of the lectures will be periodically updated to ensure it remains relevant. Furthermore, at the end of the two year fellowship, the fellows will participate in exit surveys in order to attain feedback on their experience with the lectures and course. P-592 Localized Ewing's Sarcoma of the Mandible Managed Surgically with Free Fibula Flap Reconstruction in a Toddler S. Mishra 1, R. Arora2, S. Dabas3, S. Jain4, G. Kapoor4 1Department of Pediatric Surgical Oncology, Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Research Centre, Delhi, India; 2Department of Plastic and reconstructive surgery, Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Research Centre, Delhi, India; 3Department of Surgical Oncology, Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Research Centre, Delhi, India; 4Department of Pediatric Hematology & Oncology, Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Research Centre, Delhi, India Background: Ewing's sarcoma(ES) of head and neck is rare comprising 14% of all cases. Jaw lesions present a distinct surgical challenge due to cosmetic inadequacy and functional impairment. We wish to present this child with ES of mandible successfully managed with resection and free fibular flap reconstruction. Design/ Method: Retrospective review of hospital records Results 2 \u00bd yearsoldboy had left jaw swelling for 2 months. Workup confirmed localized ES of left mandible upto the midline. After 4 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (VAC/IE), there was partial response. Since radiation posed higher long term complications, parents chose surgery. He underwent segmental resection of left mandible including teeth of left lower jaw upto right 1st premolar, preserving the left angle of mandible. Frozensection revealed clear margins. Reconstruction was done by plastic and reconstructive surgeons using free fibular flap. Harvested vascularized fibula was remodeled by osteotomies after accurate measurements and calculations, to give the exact shape of excised mandible. Fixation with reabsorbable screws and plate allowed for growth potential. Vascular anastomosis was performed using operatingmicroscope and 90 sutures. Tracheostomy was done to prevent airway obstruction. The 7hours surgery did not require blood transfusion. He was electively ventilated for 48 hours and recovered smoothly. Tracheostomy tube was removed on 10th day. The free flap was healthy. Histopathology showed 100% necrosis (Huvos Grade 4) with negative margins, hence radiation was avoided. Cosmetic appearance was excellent. Soft diet was resumed after one month and chemotherapy was restarted. The child is well 5 months after surgery and awaits dental implants. Discussion: Free fibular flap reconstruction for ES of mandible gives an excellent cosmetic and functional result. A thorough literature search revealed that it has been reported in very few children younger than 3 years. Long term follow up through puberty is recommended for any growth discrepancy which may need distraction osteotomy. Haematology Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia PO-001 Pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia: The Journey So Far and the Long Road Ahead R. Chennamaneni 1, S. Bala1, S. Gundeti1, L. maddali1 1Nizam's Institute Oncology, Hyderabad, India Background/Objectives: Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia(ALL) is the most common childhood cancer,of which BALL and TALL account for 80% and 20% respectively.With the recent advances in therapy and supportive care,survival rates have improved dramatically,but are still lower in developing countries compared to developed countries.In the present study,we analyzed the outcomes in pediatric ALL at our institute. Design/Methods: This is a single centre,retrospective study.Patients with diagnosis of ALL aged from 021 years,who presented from January 2010 to December 2016 to our institute were evaluated. Results: A total of 240 patients were analyzed.The median age at presentation was 12 years (5months to 21years) with male to female ratio of 2.1:1.The median hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet count were 8.2gm/dl(1.216),18000cells/l(5004,40,000),50,000cells/l(40005,20,000)respectively.BALL and TALL were seen in 154(64%) and 86(36%) of patients respectively. Evaluable cytogenetics were present in 119(50%)of patients,of which 29(24%) had risk cytogenetics.Treatment protocols used MCP841 and BFM95 ALL.Postinduction complete response,partial response and induction failure were seen in 198(83%),29(12%),13(5%)patients respectively.The baseline characteristics were comparable among BALL and TALL groups except for higher median leukocyte count of 40,650(16004,40,000) in TALL.The 3year eventfree survival(EFS) and overall survival(OS) population was 52% and 58% respectively.The 3year EFS and OS in BALL and TALL were 59%,64% and 45%,49% respectively.On univariate analysis male sex,organomegaly,leukocyte count of >1 lakh and lack of postinduction response had significant impact on EFS and OS(p=0.006,0.003,0.02,0.003 for EFS respectively and p=0.005,0.01,0.04,0.001 for OS respectively). Age,lymphadenopathy,mediastinal mass or lineage(BALL vs TALL) had no significant impact.High risk cytogenetics had significant impact on EFS but not OS(p=0.04 for EFS). Conclusions: BALL constituted the majority in our study. Male sex,organomegaly,>1 lakh leukocyte count and lack of postinduction response had significant impact on outcome.3year EFS and OS was 52% and 58% which indicates that, we have a long way to go in terms of achieving outcomes equivalent to western published literature. PO-002 An Anusual Case of Massive Leukoencephalitis in a Child with an Early Meningeal Relapse of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia R. Parasole 1, Varone2, Unit, Napoli, Italy Background/Objectives: nervous system (CNS) is a frequent site of relapse in pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). Triple intrathecal therapy (TIT) with cytarabine, methotrexate and prednisone is the mainstay therapy of CNS relapse. However, TIT may provoke significant toxicity on CNS. We describe the case of a child with an early isolated CNS relapse of ALL who showed massive leukoencephalopathy after the first TIT. Design/Methods: At therapy discontinuation, during disease restaging, the diagnostic lumbar puncture showed turbid cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for pleocytosis (8100 cells/uL) and cytospin confirmed the presence of blast Bcells. The patient showed negative physical and neurological examination and normal blood count. Suddenly, TIT was performed to reduce the abnormal liquoral pleocytosis. To prevent toxicities from tumor lysis syndrome, hydratation, allopurinol, desamethasone, acetazolamide and seizure prophylaxis with levetiracetam. After few hours, the patient showed hyperthension, skin rash, hallucinations, hypothonia of lower limb, until complete paralisis of all legs. A brain resonance (MRI) showed diffuse hyperintensity of white matter, particularly in subcortical, cerebellar areas, optic chiasm and brainstem in T2Flair sequences. This pattern was interpreted as grade IV leukoencephalopathy. The child was transferred to intensive care unit due to respiratory distress that required intubation. A diagnostic lumbar puncture performed during the following days showed CSF negativity. Results: Patient persisted in deep coma for 5 days before restart a spontaneous breathing. After waking up, he showed rapid neurological ameliorations. Systemic chemotherapy with highdose MTX and IT ARAC was restarted without any additional neurotoxicity. Dosage of interleukin 6 levels on CSF is ongoing. Conclusions: The severity and rapidity of event's onset, associated with quickly CSF remission, suggests that neurotoxicity could be related to cytokine release syndrome due to massive blast lysis, rather than to direct drug damage on CNS. The CSF IL6 dosing could clarify the pathogenesis of the event. PO-003 Characteristic of Nutrition Status, Dietary Intake, Mother's Knowledge and Practices in Feeding to Children with Cancers at Pediatric Center, Hue Central Hospital, Vietnam P.H. Hung 1, H. Vu Thi2 1Hue Central Hospital, Pediatric Center, Hue, Vietnam; 2Hue Central Hospital, Pediatric Center, Hue Vietnam, Vietnam Background/Objectives: Adequate nutrition is one of the components of supportive and palliative care, plays an important role in success of childhood cancer treatment. However, this issue has not been paid much attention in Vietnam. The purpose of this study was to assess nutrition status, dietary intake of children with cancer, knowledge and practices on children care and how mothers feed the children. Design/Methods: A cross sectional study was conducted in 76 children with cancer aged 6 months 15 years. Children was measured their weight and height. Food intake data were taken and mothers were interviewed about feeding knowledge and practices. Results: The results showed that malnutrition accounts for 31,6% (<2SD to 3SD was 23,7% and <3SD %), under height was 44,8% (<2SD to 3SD was 29 % and <3SD to 4SD was 15,8 %). The energy consumption was less than 50% of the energy need by age and by disease. Protein energy consumption rate accounts for 10%. No dietary intake of milk was 34,6%, beef 32,6 %, eggs 19.2%. Conclusions: Nutrition is an important part of the health of all children, but it is especially important for children getting cancer treatment. In our center malnutrition and under height in children with cancer in our center were high. Nutritional knowledges and practices on childhood cancer care and the feeding of the mothers were quite poor. In order to improve the situation, providing education about nutrition for the mothers is needed. PO-004 Successful Treatment of Acute Biphenotypic Leukemia in Children LowDose Chemotherapy in Uzbekistan S. Ibragimova 1 1Institute Of Hematology And Blood Transfusion, Children, Tashkent, Uzbekistan Background/Objectives: According to some authors, the optimal therapeutic approach for acute biphenotypic leukemia may include aggressive chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation, but this is not supported by serious research. The paper assessed the effectiveness of chemotherapy protocol ALLMB2008 with lowdose methotrexate in the treatment of acute biphenotypic leukemia. Design/Methods: There were 5 patients with biphenotypic acute leukemia. The average age of the patients was 8,4 \u00b1 1,3, the ratio of the gender: 2 males, 3 females. In the immunological study of bone marrow, all patients had a blast cells linearly mixed immunophenotype (B + myelo), on morphological and cytochemical features of blast cells referred to lymphoblasts. An initial data: all patients spleen was less than 4 cm, initial leukocyte count was 30 thousand. One patient had t (9; 22) BCR / ABL p210 PCR, from the 15th day, for induction he received an additional imatinib 300 mg/m2 daily inside. Results: Of the 300 patients with acute leukemia treated in children's department of the Research Institute of Hematology in Uzbekistan for the period 20142016. 5 patients diagnosed with acute biphenotypic leukemia and treated with ALLbased induction regimen. Early response to the 15th day of treatment in all patients ascertained. All 5 patients went into clinical remission after induction course. During induction all 5 patients had severe sepsis, bronchopneumonia. On the 36th day, all patients achieved clinical remission. The patients received consolidation chemotherapy according to plan for the intermediaterisk group with low doses of MTX 30 mg/m2 intramuscularly weekly, with additional lumbar puncture with three cytotoxic drugs. A median followup of 15.4 months. The 2year diseasefree survival and overall survival estimates were 100%. Conclusions: ALLbased lowdose chemotherapy regimen has shown high efficacy in a significant reduction in toxicity. The use of this protocol enabled outpatient treatment. PO-005 Current Outcomes of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) Among Children in Gulf Counties (GC); A Systematic Analysis Z. Kanakkande Kandy 1 1Burjeel Hospital, pediatric hematology and ooncology, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates Background/Objectives: Published literature from GC on ALL in children is scant. This comprehensive review of published literature was conducted to understand the current outcome of childhood ALL in GC. Design/Methods: A search of Medline and EMBASE using keywords leukemia, child, and Gulf Countries was carried out. All studies, which reported outcomes on survival, related to ALL published up to, 2016, are included. The results of the searches were compared and merged. The reference list of all included studies was searched to identify any other eligible studies. Results: The number of studies published is scarce. Of the 8 studies identified, 7 single centre studies and 1 multicentre study from 4 out of 7 GC met the inclusion criteria. There were a total of 2,780 children with ALL (32698 children/study). The median age at presentation was 0\u20144.37 years in majority of the studies. Minimum Residual Disease (MRD) was not used in majority of cases. Treatment consisted of chemotherapy but there was considerable variation in chemotherapy use among different canters. Different chemotherapies were used; most commonly often without (Minimal Residual Disease) MRD based risk stratification. There was only one multicenter study published yet. Median overall survival (OS) was range 7286.9% and Event Free Survival (EFS) Range 30.673%. Reported rate of abandonment were limited. Data on longterm side effects was also very limited. Conclusions: Survival outcomes of ALL in children in GC are encouraging. Lack of publication from many centers makes it difficult to understand current practices and outcome from many centers. We recommend co ordinated multicentre approach in collaboration with western centers in treating and analyzing experiences to address several questions. Role of children cancer registry for entire Gulf Countries and its effective use is highly recommended.

Progress resulted from combination chemotherapy, central nervous system preventive therapy and maintenance chemotherapy. Cytogenetic, immunophenotyping, and early treatment response refine risk categorization. In our center we use Children Cancer Group CCG regimens. Objectives: Find relapse time and site, survival percentage in relapsed cases. Assess our event free survival EFS and overall survival OS and Death causes. Design/Methods: From January 2005 to December 2016 children with ALL are collected. Bone marrow BM immunophenotyping and cytogenetic data are gathered. Cerebrospinal fluid CSF, early treatment response and postinduction minimal residual disease MRD are collected. Relapse time and site are determined as well as EFS and OS. Results: Sixtysix patients, male29, age range (1.511) year, median 5 years. Immunophenotyping; 56/66 Blineage ALL, 5/66 TALL, 3 unknown, mixedlineage. CSF positive 7/66 (11%); cytogenetics; normal 12, hyperdiploidy for each MLL, Runx, TEL/AML and trisomy21. Early response to therapy available in 22/66; rapid early response 19/22 (86%) and slow early (14%). Positive MRD 3/17, combined and 1 isolated BM (2/3 survived). Early relapse; 2 BM, 2 combined, 1 CNS (4/5 survived). Late 4 survived). 11/17 survived relapsed cases; 4 allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT), 2 awaiting SCT, 5 cured with secondline chemotherapy. EFS (67%) and OS 56/66 (85%). Death causes; 5 refractory ALL, 3 toxic deaths, 1 secondary neoplasm 5 year offtherapy (Glioblastoma Multiform) and 1 died in car accident. Conclusions: CCG chemotherapy regimens with applying risk stratification would have favorable outcome. PO-007 Chromosome Abnormalities in Childhood Cancer K. Lee 1, J. Kim1, J. Seo1, E. Choi2, J. Kim1 1Kyungpook National University, Pediatrics, Daegu, Republic of Korea; 2Daegu Catholic University Medical Center, Pediatrics, Daegu, Republic of Korea Background/Objectives: Chromosome abnormalities have been found in leukemia and solid tumor since Nowell and Hungerford discovered the first in 1960. We reviewed the results of 15,921 cytogenetic studies for 34 years. Cytogenetic study had been done with various samples of peripheral blood for clinical diagnosis of chromosomal abnormal patient or reproductive problem, of amniotic fluid or cadaver for the genetic counseling or prenatal diagnosis and of peripheral blood, bone marrow and/or tumor mass for the cancer patient in the Pediatric Cytogenetic Laboratories of Kyungpook National University Hospital, Daegu, Republic of Korea between 1981 and 2014. Design/Methods: The type of cancer was various. In cancer patient the sample s were collected at diagnosis, remission and relapse. No mitogen was applied in cancer cytogenetic study. TrypsinGiemsa stain for banding was applied for all chromosome preparation. Chromosome study was done in 16,350 cases. The data were analyzed in 15,921 excluding 429 cases of no cell growth or no date. The samples were peripheral blood in 8,323, amniotic fluid and chorionic villi in 1,035, bone marrow (BM) and tissue in 6,563 cases. Annual number of examine was 816 in recent 10 years. Results: Male to female ratio was 1:1.1. The mean age was 23.8 y/o (1 day89 y/o). Of BM samples for cancer patient, numerical aberrations were found in 217 cases (hypodiploidy; 131, hyperdiploidy; 50, hypotriploidy; 3, hypertriploidy; 5, hypotetraploidy; 5 and hypertetraploidy; 23) and structural abnormalities monosomy; 461). Only 2 Philadelphia chromosomes were found in two childhood CML patient. Conclusions: During cell culture study we realized a certain factors will cause chromosome abnormalities during mitosis, perhaps just before prophase? Cytogenetic study for cancer patients is very convenient and very essential tool for the diagnosis, the process of remission and relapse classically since 1960. PO-008 Pattern of Acute Leukemia Presentation at a Tertiary Hospital in Nigeria V. Nwatah 1, A. Oyesakin1, N. Ukpai1, E. David2, T. Wakama2, Abuja, Department of Paediatrics, Abuja, Nigeria; 2National Hospital Abuja, Department of Hematology, Abuja, Nigeria Background/Objectives: Acute leukemia is a common childhood malignancy but its occurrence in low and middle income countries are underreported. Its pattern of presentation varies depending on several factors. The objective of this report is to determine the pattern of presentation of acute leukemias in children at a tertiary hospital in Nigeria. Design/Methods: A retrospective crosssectional study of children managed for acute leukemia at the Paediatric department in a 5 year period. Of 31 patients, 27 had adequate records which were reviewed. Data collected include patient's demographics, clinical features and treatment outcome. Results: There were 16 males and 11 females, aged 8 months to 16 years (mean 7.45 years \u00b1 4.75 SD). Middle class was the predominant socioeconomic status of caregivers (51.9%). Fortyeight percent of the patients were referred from tertiary health centre while 40.7% were from secondary health centres. The pattern of clinical features were fever (85.2%), pallor (92.6%) and splenomegaly (51.9%). The specific leukemia type ratio of Acute Myeloid leukemia (AML) to Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was 1: 2.9. The parents of three patients took their children away before commencement of treatment, one patient completed treatment and 6 (22.2%) died before completing treatment. Nearly half of the patients were lost to follow up to seek alternative care while 9 (33.3%) of the patients were in remission at last follow up. Lost to followup was found not to be significantly associated with socioeconomic status, age and sex with pvalues of 0.68, 0.43 and 0.56 respectively. Conclusions: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia remain the predominant type of childhood leukemia in our setting. Majority of the patients presented with fever and pallor moreover the default to followup plagued treatment completion. PO-009 OPG, RANKL and DKK1 in Acute Sfiridaki2, E. Athanasopoulos1, N. Katzilakis1, E. Stiakaki 1 of of Heraklion, Pediatric HematologyOncology, Heraklion Crete, Greece; 2Venizeleion General Hospital, Crete, Greece Background/Objectives: Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia(ALL) the commonest childhood malignancy, in many cases presents with musculoskeletal manifestations. Bone lessions are also manifested as treatment complications. The pathogenesis of bone disorders in children with ALL has not been clarified thoroughly so far. Recently, the biology of bone metabolism has been studied extensively and new molecules are identified such as osteoprotogerin(OPG), a protein which inhibits the loss of the bone, proteins RANKL/RANK with osteoclastic activity and the molecule Dickkopf (DKK1), a soluble inhibitor of the osteoblastic activity of the Wnt/bcatenin pathway. The study of the OPG, RANKL/RANK and DKK1 system in childhood ALL Design/Methods: Forty patients(24 boys), aged 118 years old(mean age 7 years) with ALL (38 lineage) were studied. All patients received treatment according to current ALL protocols and risk stratification group, 33 median and 7 high risk. Three (7,5%) of them relapsed. The serum values of OPG, RANKL and DKK1 were determined at diagnosis and the end of treatment. Statistic analysis was made with the use of ttest (paired ttest) Results: A statistically significant decrease of osteoprotogerin values was estimated at the end of treatment compared to the levels at diagnosis. The RANKL and DKK1 values determined increased at the end of treatment compared to diagnosis, without statistical signifigance. Although bone manifestations at diagnosis or during the treatment were documented in 25% of our patients, there was no statistically significant difference in OPG, RANKL and Dkk1 values between children with or without bone manifestations. Mean value at Diagnosis Mean value at the end of treatment P value SE Sons, Ltd. This article is being made freely available through PubMed Central as part of the COVID-19 public health emergency response. It can be used for unrestricted research re-use and analysis in any form or by any means with acknowledgement of the original source, for the duration of the public health emergency. Conclusions: According our preliminary results, a significant decrease of OPG values estimated between diagnosis and treatment completion.The precise role of OPG, RANKL/RANK and DKK1 in childhood ALL needs further investigation. PO-010 Microrna1555P, Promoted Proliferation and Suppressed Apoptosis by Regulating the FOXO3A Signaling Pathway, Is Associated with Early Relapse in Pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia 1The First Affiliated Hospital Sun Yatsen University, Department of Pediatrics, Guangzhou, China Background/Objectives: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common pediatric malignancy. Treatment effect in early recurrence of ALL is very bad, so we need to identify miRNAs that can predict risk of early relapse in pediatric patients with ALL. Design/Methods: We used the highthroughput miRNAseq analysis between three diagnostic bone marrow samples and three early relapse bone marrow samples to determine miRNA expression profiles associated with early relapse in ALL. Six miRNAs were selected for further confirmation performed by real time quantitative PCR on thirtyone diagnostic samples and ten early relapse samples. Apoptosis and proliferation were analyzed using siRNA transfection, MTS assay, western blot and flow cytometry. Results: results demonstrated that miR1555p was upregulated in early relapse samples compared with diagnostic samples. miR1555p promoted cell proliferation and suppressed cell apoptosis by negatively regulating the expression of tumor suppressorForkhead box O3a (FOXO3a) in ALL cells. Remarkably, miR1555p overexpression inhibited the expression of FOXO3a and its downstream targets bim and p27kip1. Meanwhile, miR1555p knockdown induced the expression of FOXO3a and its downstream targets. Furthermore, FOXO3a overexpression inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis by promoting the expression of bim and p27kip1 in ALL cells. Conclusions: These results provide a possible underlying molecular mechanism to explain the association between miR1555p and early relapse in pediatric ALL, and suggest that approaches to inhibit miR1555p expression or induce FOXO3a expression may offer promising therapeutic strategies in the ALL early relapse treatment. Haematology Myeloid Leukemias, Myelodysplastic and Myeloproliferative Syndromes of Children in Georgia: 10Year FollowUp M. Khvedelidze 1, A. Central Hospital, Hematology/Oncology, Tbilisi, Georgia Background/Objectives: Children with Down syndrome (DS) have a 10 to 15fold higher risk of developing Bcell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (DSALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (DSAML). Despite higher treatment related toxicities, riskbased therapy for Down syndrome related childhood acute leukemia has been widely appreciated across many clinical trials. Design/Methods: Clinical records of 7 children with Down syndrome associated acute leukemia, admitted over the last 10 years were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were treated at M. Iashvili Children's Central Hospital, department of hematology/oncology, the only facility in Georgia providing care for children with hematological malignancies. Results: 7 children (6 Males and 1 Female) with Down syndrome have been admitted since the January of 2005. Median age of the patients was 27 months (range: 1832 months), three of them were diagnosed DSAML and four presented with DSALL. Considering an overall number of 390 new cases of acute childhood leukemia (ALL307 and AML83 cases) admitted at the hospital since 2005, Down syndrome associated acute leukemia accounted for approximately 1.8% of all cases. Despite widely appreciated higher risk of developing acute megakaryocytic leukemia (AMLM7) in children with Down syndrome, none of the analyzed DSAML cases showed AMLM7 morphology or phenotype. All DSALL patients were diagnosed as Common ALL. DSAML patients were treated with AMLBFM2004 and DSALL cases with ALLICBFM 2004 protocol. All DSALL patients had good treatment response and have been staying disease free. One of the DSAML patients experienced an induction failure and another developed bone marrow relapse after 135 days of induction, both patients died of the disease. Conclusions: The 10year incidence of Down syndrome associated acute leukemia of childhood in Georgia is comparable to reported rates from other countries, although according to our data, the cases of DSALL outnumbered DSAML patients and we also observed a trend of higher event free survival of DSALL patients comparing to DSAML. PO-012 Acute Myeloid Leukemia: Correlation of Cytogenetics and Outcome in a Tertiary Care Pediatric Centre M. Naseer 1, P. Ankit1, K. Purva1, C. Shraddha1, Wadia for Children, Department of Pediatric HematoOncology, Mumbai, India Background/Objectives: Acute leukemia constitutes most common childhood cancers worldwide and in India. Over the past 20 years, the outcome of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) in children has improved substantially. There is limited data on childhood AML in India. Design/Methods: Retrospective analysis of 42 patients with AML from Jan 2012 till March 2017 was done. Demographic data collected, Cytogenetics obtained for risk stratification (WHO classification). Induction (7+3 & 5+2) followed high dose cytarabine (3 cycles) as consolidation followed by 1 year of maintenance with 6TG and Cytarabine. Remission and relapse rates calculated with respect to risk stratification. Follow up data analyzed. Results: 76% of the patients belonged to 110 years with Male: Female ratio of 2:1. Study included 35 patients of AML and 7 of APML. Of the 32 patients treated, 3 denied treatment. Post induction remission was seen in 56% with failure in 44%. Post induction remission rates (MRD <0.1%) were 38%, and failure rates of 7%, 64% and 28% in low, intermediate and high risk patients. None of Low risk patients relapsed whereas 25% and 28% of patients relapsed in intermediate and high risk respectively. Of the 6 who completed treatment 3 year overall survival was 50% (rest 3 relapsed). Of the 32 treated patients 6 (18%) had post induction death due to sepsis (90%), bleeding manifestation (6%) and other causes (4%) (Hyperleukocytosis).The low survival rate is due to low socioeconomic strata, poor supportive care, and non availability of bone marrow transplantation facility. Conclusions: Low risk group has good remission rates with none relapsing as yet with high percentage of relapse in intermediate and high risk group. To improve overall survival in intermediate and high risk patients, risk based chemotherapy, optimization of supportive care and affordable transplant facility is mandatory even in low resource set up. PO-013 Childhood Noonan Syndrome with FLT3ITDPositive Acute Myeloid Leukemia - A Case Report T. Sarashina 1,2, H. Goto2, N. Miyagawa2, 2Kanagawa Medical Center, Division of Hematooncology/Regenerative Medicine, Yokohama, Japan Background/Objectives: Noonan syndrome (NS) is a RASopathy characterized by facial dysmorphy, developmental disorder, short stature, and a wide spectrum of heart defects. Hematologic disorders such as myeloproliferative disease or acute lymphoid leukemia have been reported in patients with NS. In nonsyndromic patients, somatic PTPN11 mutations may be detected in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), pediatric common acute lymphoid leukemia, pediatric acute monocytic leukemia (FAB M5). Design/Methods: Case presentation: Here, we present a clinical and molecular characterization of a childhood NS patients with FMSlike tyrosine kinase3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3ITD)positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The patient was a 12yearold male who presented with swollen and bleeding gums and enlarged hepatomegaly, no splenomegaly. The complete blood count revealed thrombocytopenia and leukocytosis. Bone marrow aspiration consisted of 83.4% monoblasts, which were stained with nonspecific esterase and no peroxidase, and he was diagnosed with AML (FABM5a). Moreover, genetic testing revealed a FLT3ITDpositive mutation. From a clinical characteristic such as short stature and distinctive facial feature, PTPN11 mutation was detected by genetic testing, and Noonan syndrome was diagnosed. He received remission induction therapy. After short term of remission, AML relapsed during maintenance therapy. He underwent stem cell transplantation (SCT) and died of progressive disease. Comprehensive mutation analysis of an 88gene panel was performed using targeted nextgeneration sequencing in leukemic cells at the onset. Results: In our case, MLL partial tandem duplication, FLT3ITD, RUNX1 mutation were identified in the analysis. Conclusions: FLT3ITDpositive AML with NS is an extremely rare case and we discuss our patient with NS and the results of genetic analysis in leukemic cells. Haematology Lymphomas PO-014 Childhood NonHodgkin Lymphomas in the West and the Southwest Regions of Algeria from January, 2000 Till December, 2009 M. Rouaida1, L. D2, B. Ahmed 3, B. N4, K. L.A5, B. M6, T. Hadj7, Oran, Algeria; 8C H U Oran, HematoOncology, Oran, Algeria Background / Objectives: Summary The nonHodgkin lymphomas (NHL) occupied the first place of cancersin childhood during year 2003, with a 16.7 % frequency according to statistics given by the Register of cancers of Algiers. The objective of our study is to describe the epidemiological, clinical and histological profiles of paediatric NHLin the Western and the Southwest regions of Algeria during decade 2000 to 2009. Design/Methods: it is an observational study from the files of patients less than 16 years old, hospitalised in the Emir AbdelkaderCentre (CEA) for the diagnosis of NHL. LMNH was defined according to clinical, cytological and/or histological criteria of the WHO. Registration and analysis of data were performed on software SPSS version 20. Results: 213 children were registered as LMNH over ten years. A peak of incidence of NHLwas observed between 2 8 years. NHL are rare before the age of 2 years. The abdominal sitewas the most frequent with a 47 % rate. Unusual sites of the disease were observed in 11 % of patients. Stade III was predominant in all sites of our series. Lymphoblastichistological type was the most frequent with a 45 % rate, followed by Burkitt type (30 %) and type T (17 %). Conclusions: NHLare frequent in children. They are clinically different from adult NHL because of theextranodal disease. For these pathologies, early diagnosis remains a priority in themanagement. PO-015 PET/TC Utility in the Assessment of the Response to Treatment in Pediatric Lymphomas R. LopezAlmaraz 1, A. Echebarr\u00eda Barona1, U. Medicine Service, Cruces Bilbao, Spain Background/Objectives: Evaluate the response to chemotherapy (Ch) in the 18FFDGPET/CT of pediatric patients with Hodgkin's Lymphoma (HL) and NonHodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) to decide the correct therapeutic attitude. Design/Methods: Retrospective observational study of pediatric HL and NHL diagnosed in a tertiary hospital in the last 9 years (January 2008January 2017). Results: We reviewed 26 lymphoma (8%). Within the HL,30% were lymphocytic predominance; Half IA stages that were resolved exclusively with surgery and the remainder, IIA stages requiring Ch without radiotherapy (RT); All presented complete morphometabolic response in PET/CT. The remaining 10 patients(70%) were of the classical subtype: 9 patients (stages IA,IIA,IIIA and IV) required only Ch since some presented partial morphological response and all complete metabolic in PET/CT. A single patient with stage IV also required RT for partial morphometabolic response. 100%of patients are currently in complete remission (RC). Among the Burkitt L, 63% (2 IIIAR, 1 IVAR, 1 IIIRI and 1 IBR) required an increase in the risk group for presenting a partial morphometabolic response (one case confirmed by biopsy) 75% currently in CR, one in treatment and one deceased. The remaining three did not require group increase by complete morphometabolic response after Ch induction. Within patients with Lymphoblastic Lymphoma and anaplastic are all in CR; But only one PET/CT scan was used to evaluate the response Conclusions: The use of PET/CT is very established in the case of HL when making decisions regarding the therapeutic attitude. Nevertheless it needs more studies in NHL. It seems reasonable that in the presence of a partial metabolic response to induction in In NHL, should lead to an increase in the risk group. PO-016 Primary Bone Lymphomas: Report of 10 Cases from a Single Center N. Kurucu 1, C. Aky\u00fcz1, I. Bajin1, B. Aydn1, M. Buyukpamukcu1, T. 1Hacettepe Medicine, Department of Pedatric Oncology, ANKARA, Turkey; 2Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pathology, ANKARA, Turkey Background/Objectives: Primary bone lymphomas (PBL) constitute less than 5% of all extranodal nonHodgkin lymphomas (NHL). The objective of this study was to report our institutional experience with bone lymphomas over a 35year period. Design/Methods: From 1980 to 2016, 1412 children with NHL were admitted to the Pediatric Oncology Department of Hacettepe University. Of these, ten children with primary bone lymphoma (except for fascial bone and cranium) were evaluated retrospectively. Results: There were six males and four females with a median age of 84 months. Most common complaints were pain and swelling. Median duration of symptoms was 2 months. Most common tumor location was femur and tibia. Two patients had localized lymph node involvement and two had polyosseous disease. Histopathological subtypes were precursor T cell lymphoma in three patients, anaplastic large cell lymphoma in one, precursor B cell lymphoma in one and unclassified in five. Patients were treated with various chemotherapeutic regimens according to histopathological subtype. Three patients received radiotherapy. Recurrence was observed in four patients within a median 17.5 months; three of which lost the followup and one died with infection. Two patients died from disease progression, three died from treatmentrelated complications. Six patients (60%) are alive and disease free at a median of 172 (42322) months. Overall and event free survival rates were 77% and 48%. Polyosseous disease had shorter overall survival rates than monoosseous types (85% vs 66.7% p:0.68). Conclusions: Although secondary involvement of bones in lymphoma is not uncommon, lymphomas originating from bone are rare. Most cases are seen in the fifthsixth decade. Primary bone lymphoma constitutes 0.7% of our NHL cases. Lymph node involvement and polyosseous disease has worse prognosis in adults. Multicenter studies with more cases are necessary to determine prognostic factors in childhood bone lymphomas. PO-017 We Have Cases Withprimary Gastrointestinal Lymphoma Complicated with Intussusception, The Clinical Data were Retrospectively and Analyzed C. Zhang 1 1Zhengzhou Children's Hospital, Surgical pediatric oncology, ZhengZhou, China Background/Objectives: To summarize the features of children with primary gastrointestinal lymphoma complicated with intussusception. Design/Methods: Patients records in Childrens Hospital of Zhengzhou were retrieved for cases whose initial diagnosis was intussusception and discharge diagnosis included lymphoma.Clinical data of 11 patients with primary gastrointestinal lymphoma complicated with intussusception with extensive followup, treated in our department between January 2012 and December 2016, were retrospectively and analyzed. Results: All 11 patients with PGIL presented as intussusception initially, age from 1.6 to 10 (10 cases>3), while intussusception appeared repeatedly in 5 cases (3 cases>3). All 11 patients received surgical treatment,among them,abnormal lumps were found at intussusceptum in 9 cases,local intestinal wall were thicken and rigid. In 1 case, there was a suspicious focal necrosis around the rigid wall.Local resection was performed successfully for each case without postoperative complication of intestinal obstruction, anastomotic leakage or stricture.Pathological examination revealed 6 cases of diffuse large Bcell lymphoma and 5 of Burkitts lymphoma. 1 cases was classified to be tumor stage , the remaining 10 cases to be stage .10 cases were treated with chemotherapy, the other 1 given up treatment, and died 13 months after operation.During a median followup period of 25 months, tumor recurrence had not been found in these 10 cases. Conclusions: For children with recurrent intussusception or episode at atypical age, PGIL should be concerned.Abnormal mass on intestinal wall, or intestinal wall stiffness such as leather, or mesenteric mass should be resected for Pathological examination. Early postoperative chemotherapy can provide children with PGIL a good prognosis. Haematology Stem Cell Transplantation (Haematological Diseases/Technique and Supportive Care) PO-018 A Case of Congenital Dyserthropoietic Anemia Successfully Treated with Haploidentical Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation M. AlHameed 1, V. Balasa2, S. Bahrani3, H. AlHamid4, J. Rosenthal1 1City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Pediatrics Hematology/Oncology and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Duarte CA, cells therapeutics, Duarte CA, USA; 4Providence Hospital and Medical Center, Internal Medicine, Southfield MI, USA Background/Objectives: Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia (CDA) is a group of rare anemia disorders in which there is bone marrow dyserythropoiesis and secondary hemochromatosis. CDA is classified into three major types (I, II, III) based on bone marrow morphology, genetic mutations and inheritance pattern. Allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only cure for CDA and most reported cases used HLAidentical sibling or matched unrelated donors. Design/Methods: Case report. Results: We report an 8 yearold male with CDA requiring monthly blood transfusion and deferasirox who was referred to our center for HSCT evaluation. Due to lack of HLAidentical sibling or matched unrelated donor, the decision was made to proceed with haploidentical HSCT from his father. The nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen Antithymocyte globulin, Busulfan, and Fludarabine. Posttransplant cyclophosphamide (ptCY) following uneventful of mobilized hematopoietic stem cells, and tacrolimus with mycophenolatemofetil were used for prevention of graftvshost disease (GVHD). Myeloid and platelet engraftment were recorded on day +16 and day +78, respectively. The patient tolerated the treatment well with minimal adverse effects. Evaluation of bone marrow on day +111 showed normocellular marrow(60%) with mild erythrocytic hyperplasia and adequate granulopoiesis. During the treatment course, he experienced only few episodes of infections, mild GIGVHD, and mild skinGVHD that were all resolved. One year postHSCT, the peripheral count revealed; WBC(4.2k/L), hemoglobin(11.2g/dL), hematocrit(27.3%) and platelets(143,000/L). The patient condition remained stable and he remains transfusion free. He resumed his normal childhood and is happily attending school. Conclusions: CDA is a rare disorder with paucity of data regarding its management. HSCT is the only cure available today. Our experience showed that haploidentical donors are good alternatives when HLAmatched sibling or matched unrelated donors are unavailable. The advancement in the nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen with the use of ptCY, suggests that haploidentical HSCT could be an option for CDA treatment in the future. PO-019 Haploidentical Stem Cell Transplantation with PostTransplant Cyclophosphamide for Pediatric Relapsed/Refractory Solid Tumours: A Feasible Direction S. Kohli 1, S. with Tcell depleted grafts have been reported in few patients with neuroblastoma whereas T cell replete grafts and posttransplant Cyclophosphamide (PTCy) has rarely been reported for treatment of relapsed/refractory solid tumours, and needs to be evaluated in v/o unavailability of donors and cost issues in developing countries assocociated with T cell depleted grafts.We evaluated 6 such patients with refractory solid tumours. Design/Methods: Six patients with refractory solid tumours were evaluated prospectively. Of these 4 patients had neuroblastoma stage 3 to 4 disease post relapse. Fifth patient of Ewing's sarcoma had CNS and skeletal relapse with bone marrow involvement. Sixth patient with retinoblastoma had hepatic and skeletal relapse. All patients were in complete remission before SCT except two with neuroblastoma who had partial remission. All patients with neuroblastoma received MIBG with Bortezomib based chemotherapy before transplant. Conditioning: All patients received Fludarabine(Flu) and cyclophosphamide(Cy) and total body irradiation (TBI) except one patient with neuroblastoma who received melphalan with Flu/Cy. All Patients received part of GVHD prophylaxis. Results: Post SCT one patient with neuroblastoma died due to venoocclusive disease and the other died due to progressive CNS disease. The third patient was in complete remission with grade 1 chronic liver GVHD on treatment and is now 14 months posttransplant. Fourth patient of neuroblastoma relapsed 3 months posttransplant and was on palliative chemotherapy with WRIST protocol and is now 1 year post transplant. The patient with Ewing's sarcoma was in complete remission and is now day + 200 post HSCT with chronic GVHD of the skin on treatment. Sixth patient with retinoblastoma has a short followup and had neutrophil engraftment on Day + 13. Conclusions: Haploidentical SCT with PTCy seems feasible and efficacious for treatment of refractory solid tumours and needs further evaluation for long term outcomes. PO-020 Successful Haploidentical T Cell Replete Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in a Young Girl with Diamond Blackfan Anemia M. Ramzan 1, S. Katewa1 anemia (DBA) is a rare congenital hypoplastic anemia that usually presents in infancy and childhood. Only curative therapy for DBA is haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Most published cases have used matched related and unrelated donor HSCT with myeloablative conditioning regimens. Design/Methods: Haploidentical HSCT in DBA is scarcely mentioned in literature. We report a 5 years old girl who diagnosed with DBA at the age of 6 months. She was steroid refractory and on chronic transfusion therapy. Results: In view for nonavailability of suitable donor, underwent 5/10 haploidentical mismatch related T cell replete PBSC HSCT from ABO compatible father utilizing a myeloablative conditioning regimen including intravenous busulfan (total dose of 520 mg/m2), fludarabine (total 175mg/m2), thiotepa (10mg/kg) and rabbit ATG (4.5 mg/kg). She was also treated for class I and II HLA antibody (mean fluorescence index of 20000 each) followed by one cycle of fludarabine (total dose of 180mg/m2) and dexamethasone prior to HSCT to prevent rejection. Repeat HLA antibody titers were not done. Post transplant cyclophosphamide on day+3 and +4 with tacrolimus used as GVHD prophylaxis. Total CD34+ stem cell dose was 27 x 106/kg of recipient. Her neutrophil engrafted on day+ 15. She full on day+30, +60, +200 and +365. On she had steroid refractory grade III acute gut GVHD which was non responsive to adequate doses of etanercept, mesenchymal stem cells, basiliximab and infliximab, but eventually it responded to equine ATG and oral methotrexate. Her immunosuppression was weaned off very slowly. At 12 months of follow up she had full donor chimerism with hemoglobin of 15.2g/dl, reticulocytes of 1% and almost complete immune reconstitution of all hematopoietic stem cells. Conclusions: Haploidentical HSCT represents an effective option for cure in patients with DBA. Solid Non Brain Tumours Neuroblastoma PO-021 Burden of Neuroblastoma in Developing Countries: The Children's Hospital Lahore Pakistan Ahmad 1, N. Uddin1, F.S. Khan1 1The Children's Hospital Paediatric Haematology/Oncology, Lahore, Pakistan Background/Objectives: The Oncology Children's Hospital Lahore is a 60 bedded unit providing treatment to over 1000 new childhood cancer cases each year and over 300 admissions per month with bed occupancy rate around 200%.The aim of this retrospective study was to analyze the spectrum of Neuroblastoma and burden of high risk malignancy on the public sector tertiary center with lack of MIBG scan, NMyc amplification and stem cell transplantation services. Design/Methods: Prospective review of 70 patients with Neuroblastoma enrolled from June 2015 to December 2016 was done. Data regarding their age, sex, type, staging and clinical features, bone and bone marrow involvement, course of therapy and outcome after making diagnosis on tissue biopsy. Results: Total 70 patients with age ranging from< 1 to 9 years (Median age of 3 yrs) were included. M: F Ratio was 1.8:1, 49/70 70% of 21/70 30% with infantile type. 15/70 (22%) had stage III at presentation while 55/70 (78%) was of stage IV. 33/70 (47%) had mainly abdominal mass as the main presenting complaint, 5/70 (7%) as paraplegia, proptosis 25/70 (36%) as multiple presentations. 52/70(74%) had to travel more than 100KM to reach the primary treatment center. 37/70(53%)% had bone involvement at presentation and 49/70(70%) had bone marrow involvement. 28/70(40%) had successfully completed the chemotherapy, 13/70(19%) abandoned treatment, 17/70 (24%) expired due to progressive disease and infections, 7/70(10%) were put on palliative Rx at presentation 5/70(7%) on chemotherapy. Conclusions: In resource limited settings, Neuroblastoma stage IV is a challenging malignancy to deal with. There is intense need of increased capacity building to diagnose and treat them early and implementation of effective infection control measures with better survival options in these patients. PO-022 Therapeutic Plasma Exchange for a Case of Refractory Opsoclonus Myoclonus Ataxia Syndrome of Medicine, Hempstead, USA; 2Long Island Jewish Medical Center, Department of Pathology Transfusion Medicine, New Hyde Park, USA; 3Cohen Children's Medical Center, Division of Pediatric Hematology Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, New Hyde Park, USA Background/Objectives: Opsoclonus myoclonus ataxia syndrome (OMAS) of neuroblastoma cases. OMAS has a chronic, relapsingremitting course causing significant longterm morbidity. Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) effectively treats other immunemediated neurologic disorders. We present a case of paraneoplastic OMAS that was refractory to all common treatments, but resolved after TPE. Design/Methods: This is a case report of a 14monthold boy who achieved complete remission of otherwise refractory OMAS after TPE, and a 2nd remission after undergoing TPE for a relapse 3 years later. Results: A14monthold boy presenting with 6 weeks of chaotic eye movements, jerking of the extremities, diminishing truncal support, trembling, loss of motor milestones, and a mass of the celiac axis was diagnosed with intermediaterisk neuroblastoma with paraneoplastic OMAS. cycles of chemotherapy, including carboplatin, etoposide, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide, resulted in complete cancer remission, while the OMAS persisted. Over 4 years, oral prednisone, highdose pulse dexamethasone, monthly intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), 3 courses of rituximab, a 2nd course of cyclophosphamide, 2.5 years of adrenocorticotropic hormone, and several months of mycophenolate mofetil were trialed without resolution of symptoms. Ultimately, the patient achieved rapid remission with initiation of TPE, rituximab, and monthly IVIG. Following remission, he continued monthly tapering TPE, receiving 14 treatments in total. After over 3 years without relapse he represented with OMAS following a viral illness, with no evidence of neuroblastoma recurrence. Within 1 month of restarting treatment with TPE, oral prednisolone, IVIG, and rituximab, the patient again achieved remission. He maintained an OMAS score of 0 after a course of 6 TPE treatments without tapering and after weaning off of oral steroids. Conclusions: TPE prefaced complete remission of OMAS for a patient with highly refractory disease, initially, and again after relapse. This important proofofprinciple case demonstrates the potential efficacy of TPE in neuroblastomaassociated PO-023 Treatment P. Kerimov1, R. 1Blokhin Cancer Research Center, Department of thoracoabdominal childrens oncology surgery Institute of Pediatric Oncology, Moscow, Russia Background/Objectives: To improve the results of treatment of patients with highrisk neuroblastoma. Design/Methods: 32 patients with highrisk neuroblastoma received treatment from the DOG Research Institute from 2009 to 2016. The median followup time was 19.8 months. The study included 21 (65.6%) boys and 11 (34.4%) girls. The age of the patients ranged from 1.7 to 15 years, the average age was 4.6 \u00b1 3.3 years. Patients were divided into 2 groups depending on the regimens of chemotherapy.he programmed treatment included induction HT, surgical treatment, highdose CT, radiation therapy and biotherapy with retinoic acids. Four patients from group I who did not receive a complete response or a good partial response at the end of the phase of induction chemotherapy received systemic radiotherapy 131IMIBG. Results: The effectiveness of induction chemotherapy in the I group was 94.7%, in the II group 84.6%. Bone marrow cleansing, with induction chemotherapy, was significantly more frequent in group I after 1 course, in 71.5% of patients. All patients in the I group had bone marrow sanation, 2 (15.4%) patients in the II group of bone marrow sanation were not reached. The twoyear OS of patients with stage 4 in group I was 65.6 \u00b1 14.0%, in group II, 43.1 \u00b1 14.7%. The EFS in the I group was 33.4 \u00b1 14.5%, in the II group 23.1 \u00b1 11.7%. We found that systemic radiotherapy significantly correlated with the absence of progression or relapse of the disease. Radical surgery does not affect the prognosis of the disease. Conclusions: Induction HT with topotecan, used in group I showed a higher direct efficacy, OS and EFS in group I were higher. Patients who, at the end of the induction phase, have an active residual tumor tissue determined to perform systemic radiotherapy with 131IMIBG.

Design/Methods: Medical records of 21 patients with relapse/refractory neuroblastoma after treatment with TPOGNB 2003/2009 protocols were evaluated retrospectively. The clinical characteristics, relapse types and treatments were analized. Results: Median age at relapse was 3.5yrs was detected in 3 of MYCN() cases, del 1p was detected in one case. Shimada was unfavourable (15%), CNS (%10). There were 9 patients with refractory disease, 10 patients with systemic relapse, one patient with primary relapse. Median relapse time was 25mos (3064mos). Median progression time of refractory patients was 8mos Average 3 courses (18 courses) TCV (Topotecan, Cyclophosspamide, Vincristine) were given to 11 patients. Three courses ICE were given to 5 patients. Topotecan, temozolamide, metronomic treatment were given to one patient. High dose chemotharapy+ASCT were performed to total 11 patients (seven received TCV, 3 received ICE). Remission was not achieved in nine patients despite HDCT+ASCT, and TCV, ICE, metronomic therapy, RIST protocol, temozolomide were given to these cases. Remaining two patients died. In four refractory cases without ASCT history received TCV, ICE, vinorelbine+temozolamide treatments. Also TCV, ICE, RIST protocol or metronomic oral cyclophospamide/etoposide were given as 3th line relapse treatment. Median OS relapse patients was 41m (6m8yrs); 12mosOS 48%, 18mosOS 27%. Nine patients were than 4 years. Conclusions: Patients with relapse neuroblastoma had advanced stage disease, unfavourable histology, and MYCN amplification (35%). Progression free survival times prolonged up to 8 years. Relapse/refractory neuroblastoma behave as chronic disease with different, multiple treatment strategies. PO-026 Treatment of Non High Risk Neuroblastoma Patients Following Siopel Protocol in Vietnam from 2013 to 2015 Q. Vu 1, N. Nguyen2, L. Bui2, H. Pham3, C. Le4, Oncology Department, 6Vinmec International Hospital, Oncology Department, Hanoi, Vietnam; 7Hanoi University of Sciences Hanoi National University, Genetics Department, Hanoi, Vietnam; 8Vietnam Children's Hospital, Emergency Department, Hanoi, Vietnam Background/Objectives: Neuroblastoma is the most popular pediatric solid tumor in the first year. The treatment is based on the risk stratification. In Vietnam, we now focus in treatment for nonhigh risk patients. So we study in neuroblastoma patients in 3 years (20132015) for evaluation our results of treatment following the SIOPEL protocol. Design/Methods: The patients is classified in nonhigh risk group using the INRG classification and treated following the SIOPEL protocol. We followed up the patient each 6 months after treatment to collect the information. Results: There are 61 nonhigh risk patients in 3 years, in which 54/61 patients are treated by the SIOPEL protocol. The ratio of complete or partial response in our study at the end of protocol and at the end of study is 61,11% and 80%, respectively. The very low and low risk patients have the complete response. There are 3 aggressive patients in intermediate group. The spontaneous regression is found in 3 patients (1 Ms and 2 L2 stage). The 2 years EFS is 87,88%. Conclusions: The SIOPEL protocol for nonhigh risk neuroblastoma patient is adaptive, and give the good result for treatment on Vietnamese patients. PO-027 Clinical Effects of High Risk Neuroblastoma with Chromosome 1P36 Deletion Post Autologous Stem Cell Transplant D. Zhang 1, B. Wang1, Z. Yue1, W. Zhao1, G. Zhu1, X. Hospital Affiliated to Capital Medical University, Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing, China Background/Objectives: By describing the clinical features of post autologous stem cell transplant high risk Neuroblastoma (HRNB) patients with 1p36 deletion and their clinical outcomes, the goal was to make further progress in better survival rate and life quality. Design/Methods: A retrospective study of all HRNB patients with 1p36 deletion, who attended the pediatric hematology oncology centre from April 2014 to April 2016 and received systematic treatment and followup care, was performed. Results: A total of 11 HRNB patients with 1p36 deletion, all INSSIV, were included in the study,4 were male and 7 female. The average age was 43 months. There were 11 cases with bone marrow metastasis and 10 cases with multiple bone metastasis. Nmyc gene amplification was detected in 4 patients.11 patients were treated with 45 courses of chemotherapy before the operation. The amount of reinfused stem cells was 2.6210.68*106/L, and the median followup time was 14.9 months (932 months). All the 7 patients in stable state were in the maintenance treatment of retinoic acid. Three cases recurrent tumor progression in 3, 5 and 5 months after the reinfusion respectively. The other one occurred bone marrow recurrence and intracranial metastasis 3 months after retinoic acid chemotherapy completed. Conclusions: HRNB patients with 1p36 deletion had a high risk of developing bone marrow and bone metastases, and 1/3 of them were associated with Nmyc gene amplification. Autologous stem cell transplantation is a safe and effective therapeutic method. However, in 36 months after reinfusion and during retinoic acid maintenance therapy, tumor progression may happen and lead to poor prognosis, suggesting the strength of systemic treatment of these patients is not quiet enough. Therefore, close clinical monitoring was needed after stem cell transfusion. Intensification chemotherapy in 3 months interval, a second dose of autologous stem cell transplantation may be the primary means of prevention disease progression. PO-028 A SingleCenter Study on the Clinical Efficacy and Progression of Neuroblastoma in Pediatric Patients Y. Zhang 1, D. Huang1, W. Zhang1 1beijing tongren hospital capital medical university, pediatric, Beijing, China Background/Objectives: Study on the clinical outcome of NB associated with different risk factors by analyzing the clinical data of 147 NB patients collected in the past nine years at Beijing Tongren Hospital. Design/Methods: 147 patients of NB collected from January 2006 to January March 2015 and treated with induction and consolidation treatment.The average followingup time was 32.15\u00b121.05 months. We used SPSS 20.0 software for analyzinged the clinical data using SPSS 20.0 software for studying on the relationship between outcome of NB and different risk factors.. Results: In 147 cases, 97 patients were male (65.266%), and 50 patients were female (34.8%). The average age of the patients was (3.76\u00b12.83) years old.The OS of 147 NB patients was 54.4% (80/147). 67 Patients of NB were dead. The medium survival time of patients of NB was 48.0 months.The medium survival time of 117 patients of HR NB was 41.1 m, and the 1 year, 2 year, 3year, 4 year and 5 year OS of them was 69%,54%,45%,29%, and 16%. The medium survival time of 30 patients of IR NB was 60 m, and the 1 year, 2 year, 3year, 4 year and 5 year OS of them was 92%,86%,86%,86%, and 86%.73 patients of recurrence NB as followed up. Only 3 patients (3/73) of IR group of NB appeared recurrence (P=0.001). The 4 year OS of 70 patients (70/117) of HR NB with relapse was only 23%. Conclusions: Relapse was and older age were main risk factors in NB, no matter what group. The prognosis of IR NB was very good, but the prognosis of HR NB was poor. Therefore, we would like to resolve these problems for better prognosis we should diagnosis early and reduce relapse using reasonable diagnosis and treatment technology for improving the survival outcome of NB, special HR group patients.(improve the survival outcome?). Solid Non Brain Tumours Renal Tumours PO-029 A Rare Cause of Renal Mass in the Childhood: Malignant Solitary Fibrous Tumor G. Ersoy 1, D. Hematology Oncology, Istanbul, Turkey; 2Istanbul University School of Pediatric Oncology Department, Istanbul, Turkey Background/Objectives: Solitary fibrous tumors (SFT) are very rare, mostly benign neoplasms and originate from mesenchymal spindle cells. SFT rarely originate from kidney. Design/Methods: Here we desciribe a case of malignant, renal origin SFT with four local recurrences and metastases. Results: A 12 year old male patient admitted to our clinic with hematuria. Investigations revealed an abdominal mass of 40\u00d742 mm and radical nephrotomy was planned. Pathological diagnosis of the lesion was renal SFT the tumor was defined as malignant. As the tumor was totally resected, monthly followup was planned for the patient. One year later, ultrasound revealed a recurrent mass lesion at the primary tumor side. It was excised totally and pathological diagnosis was same as the primary tumor. After surgery, radiotherapy to tumor site and salvage chemotherapy with ifosfamide, cisplatin and etoposide were applied. No residual or recurrent mass were found at the end of the therapy. However 3 months later, a 1 cm noduler contrast enhanced mass lesion near L1 vertebra was recorded at magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The lesion was surgically removed and diagnosed as the primary tumor. An alternative chemotherapy protocol was applied after operation. Monthly followup was continued however 3 months after recurrent masses at renal and pelvic region were found. At surgery, 2 lesions with the sizes of 19x15x8 cm and 5,5 cm were found and resected. An alternative chemotherapy regimen was used again. The patient was up on bevacisumab for treatment. Conclusions: There are 49 renal SFTs described at the literature up to time and 7 are malignant. This tumour is mostly seen in adulthood, only 2 patients are younger than 18 years old (4 and 18) and both of them have benign tumors. This case is the youngest patient described in literature with malignant solitary fibrous tumour. PO-030 The First Local HighDose Chemotherapy Administration Experience in a Metastatic Wilms Tumor Pediatric Patient with Pleura and Lungs Involvement E. Levchenko 1, E. Gumbatova2, O. Mamontov1, S. Russia Background/Objectives: Our aim is to report the first clinical case of successful chemoperfusion of lungs and pleural cavity in a child with Wilms tumor. Design/Methods: In March 2014 a right kidney mass lesion was found. Tumor resection with right nephroureterectomy was performed in a local clinic. The patients received subsequent chemotherapy for stage III, blastemal type nephroblastoma according to SIOP 2003 protocol. In May 2015, a routine checkup revealed an early relapse with multiple lung metastases. Abroad 4 chemotherapy cycles with subsequent 15 Gy wholelung irradiation and highdose chemotherapy with autologous hemopoietic stem cell transplantation were performed. In May 2016 a chest CT scan revealed the second early relapse with lungs involvement. In June 2016 a left thoracotomy was performed. An intraoperative revision revealed two metastases in the lower lobe and an additional subpleural lesion 3 mm in diameter. After wedge resection of the lower lobe of the left lung the further revision yielded another centrally located lesion about 10 mm in diameter in the 6th segment. An anatomic resection of the segment was performed. Another three nodular lesions 3 to 4 mm in diameter were found on the parietal pleura of the diaphragm. After the partial pleurectomy results indicated metastatic pleural involvement by nephroblastoma. Therfore, the lung was disconnected from circulation, blood vessels were cannulated, and 30minute normothermic Due to the parietal pleura involvement found there followed an additional 60minutes hyperthermic perfusion with 150 mg of cisplatin. Results: The postoperative recovery was uneventful. The CT scan shows no signs of lungs involvement. Conclusions: The case described illustrated the feasibility and safety of local lung and pleura chemoperfusion in a heavily pretreated chemoresistant pediatric cancer patient. PO-031 NonWilms' Malignant Masses of Kidney: Experience of Few Patients with Improved Outcome B. kumar 1, V. upadhyaya1, R.N. rao2, S. kumar3 1Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute Lucknow UP India, Paediatric Surgical Superspeciality, Lucknow, India; 2Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute Medical Sciences Lucknow UP India, Pathology, Lucknow, India; 3Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical UP India, Radiodiagnosis, Lucknow, India Background/Objectives: Wilms' tumour accounts rare renal tumours including stromal tumours constitute only 15% of all paediatric renal masses. Differentiation is important for better outcome as each tumour has different chemotherapy protocol. Clear cell sarcoma, Rhabdoid tumour and Ewing`s / PNET tumour of kidney are rare tumours, considered as UNFAVORABLE tumorus due to its aggressive nature and late presentation. Our aim is to present the characteristics, disease course, management and final outcome with these rare renal tumours in few patients which showed relatively better outcome. Design/Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the electronic hospital, operation theatre and followup records of all patients having nonWilms' renal malignant masses between July 2012 to July 2016; managed at our centre. Details of patients were evaluated including demography, clinical presentations, investigations, intraoperative grading, pathology, management, final outcome and followup. Last followup was January 2017. Clinical examinations, ultrasonography, Xrays and CT/PETscans were tools of followup. Results: From July, 2012 to July, 2016, six patients with nonWilms' renal tumours were managed. Final diagnosis were clear cell sarcoma in 3 patients, rhabdoid tumour in 2 patients and Ewing's/PNET tumour in 1 patient. Almost all patients presented in stage II/III and received neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery and chemo/radiotherapy. One patient with clear cell sarcoma could not be operated; showed partial response to chemotherapy and died due to chemotherapy related toxicity. All 5 patients are under followup without recurrence. Followup period ranged from 6 - 48 months. Conclusions: The clinical characteristics of these rare renal tumours are similar to that of Wilms' tumour and preoperative diagnosis is almost impossible without histopathology/immunohistochemistry, even with modern imaging techniques. Some of these tumours progress rapidly and may result in fatal outcome. Early diagnosis and multimodal interventions in form of surgery/chem./radiotherapy are essential for better outcome.

Medical Center de ISSSTE, Pediatric Oncology, Mexico City, Mexico Background/Objectives: Ewing sarcoma occur more frequently in the second decade of life and comprise about 4% of pediatric tumors. With current protocols, survival for localized disease is around 60% and in metastatic disease is 25%. Design/Methods: A descriptive, longitudinal, observational study that included 20 patients\u00b4files with Ewing's Sarcoma at the National Medical Center \"20 de Noviembre\" ISSSTE in a period from January 2006 to December 2016. Results: Male predominance was observed (1.8:1) ; mean age of presentation was 9.9 years with a minimum and maximum age of 1 and 16 years. Of the total cases 8 (40%) were osseous and 12 (60%) were extraosseous; 9 cases were located and 11 metastasic cases, representing 45% and 55% respectively. The duration of onset of symptoms at diagnosis varied from 1 to 24 months with an average of 3.5 months. The primary sites of bone disease were lower extremities and lower limbs. The primary sites of extraosseous disease were Head and Thoracic Wall. The duration of followup varied from 1 month and 125 months with an average of 32.3 months; Overall survival was 85%; For patients with localized disease, overall survival was 88.9% and for metastatic disease 91%. Conclusions: A predominance was observed in the male gender, mean age of presentation of 9.9 years said results differ from that reported in other studies. Likewise, a predominance of extraosseous localization was observed, and overall survival was higher than that observed in other studies. PO-033 Clinical Presentation, Management and Outcomes of Primary Ewing Sarcoma of the Spine in Childhood A Case Series B. Dubashi 1, S. Kayal1, A. Mukherji2 1Jawaharlal Institute of Oncology, Puducherry, India; Radiotherapy, Puducherry, India Background/Objectives: Spine usually accounts for 6% of the Primary sites in Ewing Sarcoma. They usually present with malignant spinal cord compression necessitating early workup and treatment. Local therapy is challenging. We are presenting a shortcase series of the clinical presentation, management and outcomes of primary Ewing sarcoma of the spine in children. Design/Methods: The case records of 45 children during the period 2013 2016 with a diagnosis of Bone sarcoma presenting to the department of Medical Oncology in a regional cancer centre were screened for primary spinal Ewing Sarcoma. Clinical manifestations, treatment details including chemotherapy, surgery and radiotherapy and survival outcomes were noted. Results: Seven children with primary spinal Ewing Sarcoma were identified during the study period. The median age was 10 years (218) with M:F ratio of 3:4. Five children presented with Paraparesis of which two patients developed a flaccid paraplegia during the work up. Primary site of presentation included Cervical (n=3), Cervical and Thoracic (n=1), Dorsolumbar (n=1) and Lumbosacral (n=2). Two patients had metastasis to the bones at presentation. Three patients underwent laminectomy with excision of the mass. All patients received radiotherapy. Non metastatic patients were treated with VAC/IE protocol while patients with metastasis were treated with VAC protocol. On the date of analysis, 4 patients had progressive disease during the treatment and succumbed to illness, 2 patients completed treatment and are alive and free of disease with no neurological deficit. One patient is undergoing chemotherapy. Conclusions: Primary Spinal Ewing sarcoma are rare tumours requiring a multimodality treatment with surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. They can present with Oncologic emergency. They have a poor outcome to therapy in terms of response and survival.

Senay1, and Oncology, Istanbul, Turkey Background/Objectives: Ewing sarcoma (ES) is the second common primary bone malignancy in pediatric patients. Usually, these tumors occur in bone but sometimes they can olsa orginate in soft tissue. These tumors are agressive and treatment involves multidurgs chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery. The aim of this study was to determine outcomes of Ewing sarcoma in pediatric patients who was treated in our instution. Design/Methods: This is a retrospective study of 75 pediatric patients with Ewing Sarcoma treated in between 1996 to 2016. Results: During a 20year period, 75 patients were identified with Ewing Sarcoma in hospital database and their records were analyzed retrospectively. Of the 75 patients, 45 (60%) were males, 30 (40%) were females. The mean age was 10 years (ranging from 1year to 17 years). All of the patients had received the same chemotherapy protocol at presentation. This protocol involved ifosfamide, etoposide, vincristine, doxorubicine, cyclophosphamide and actinomycin. After 3 cycles of chemotherapy, surgery had been performed for most of the patients. Radiotherapy had been performed for the patients who had more than 10% viable cells after pathological examinations. For these patients, chemotherapy had been changed and continued during and after radiotherapy. The second chemotherapy protocol invoved vincristine, cyclophosphamide and topotecan. At the presentation, 22 (29 %) patients had metastatic disease. During the follow up 16 (23 %) patients had relapsed. The 5year event free survival and overall survival were 46 % and 58,5 %. Metastatic disease at presentation was the significant factor on overall survival. Conclusions: The management of a child or adolescent with Ewing sarcoma is best carried out in a specialized center under the care of a multidisciplinary team, in order to obtain the best outcome for the patient. Early diagnosis is very important because metastatic disease at presentation reduces the overall survival. PO-035 Expression of TUBB3 and RRM1 Proteins as Markers of Drug Resistance to Gemcitabine / Docetaxel Chemotherapy in Childhood Osteosarcoma A. and Oncology, Moscow, Russia; 2Experimental Diagnostic and Treatment of Tumor Institution FSBI \u00abN.N. Blokhin Russian Cancer Research Center\u00bb, Experimental Diagnostic and Treatment of Tumor, Moscow, Russia Background/Objectives: The treatment results of refractory childhood osteosarcoma are not satisfactory. According to the data of different pilot trials progressionfree survival curves dramatically tend to zero with a median followup in 610 months. Role of the TUBB3 and RRM1 proteins expression as markers of drug resistance to gemcitabine / docetaxel chemotherapy in childhood osteosarcoma is unknown. Design/Methods: The aim of this study was to estimate TUBB3 and RRM1 proteins expression in biopsy specimens and tumor tissue samples with poor response (grade I and II of tumor cells necrosis rate) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery of the primary site. TUBB3 and RRM1 proteins expression was assessed by immunohistochemical method antiRRM1 polyclonal (Protein Tech) and antiTUBB3 monoclonal (clone TU20, Santa Cruz) antibodies. TUBB3 positive specimen was defined as weak (+), moderate (++), strong (+++) colouring of the tumor nuclei with number of positive tumor cells above 10 percents. RRM1 positive specimen was defined as moderate (++), strong (+++) colouring of the tumor nuclei and cytoplasm with number of positive tumor cells above 25 percents. All patients were treated according to therapy like - EURAMOS1. Results: TUBB3 positive sample was revealed in 8 out of 14 (57.1%) biopsy specimens, in 3 out of 20 (15%) postoperative specimens. RRM1 positive sample was revealed in 10 out of 14 (71.4%) biopsy specimens, in 9 out of 20 (45%) postoperative specimens. TUBB3 positive, RRM1 positive sample was revealed in 5 out of 14 (37.5%) biopsy specimens, in 2 out of 20 (15%) postoperative specimens. There was not determined any significant correlation between expression of these markers and metastatic status of patients. Conclusions: These data suggest that optimal time of using gemcitabine / docetaxel could be adjuvant chemotherapy. PO-036 The Best Strategy as the First Line Treatment Through Pediatric Iranian Population with Osteosarcoma; A Retrospective Matched Cohort Study M. Faranoush 1, A. M. Treatment and Research Center, Oncology, Tehran, Iran; 2Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Bahrami Hospital, Tehran, Iran; 3Cancer Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran Background/Objectives: One of the utmost important challenges in Iranian health system is pediatric malignancies. Osteosarcoma, the common primary bone tumor, has a low survival rate in Iran. We designed this study to choose the best strategy for chemotherapy. Our goal is improving the survival rate of these patients. Design/Methods: This study conducted as a retrospective analytical cohort matched project. The randomized samples implied children less than 15 years old with approved pathological report of osteosarcoma. Patients with matched inclusion criteria categorized into two groups who administered by high dose methotrexate (HD MTX) and individuals with nonHD MTX. The failure events and survival rate of these groups were estimated by SPSS software version 22. Results: Fourty one eligible patients (non HD MTX (n=21) and HD MTX (n=20) groups) with the mean age of 11.5\u00b10.48 years were evaluated. 65.2% of patients with HD MTX and 34.8% of nonHD MTX group had conferred relapse and metastasis. The median time of events was one and nine months through patients with HD MTX and non HD MTX groups respectively. The 5year survival rate of patients with HD MTX and nonHD MTX was 18.4% versus 43.5%. Also the median time of disease free survival rate was more in non HD MTX patients (11.5 months versus one month). Conclusions: Findings revealed that survival rate and delaying in failure events were more in patients who administered by non HD MTX. As this study designed on the Iranian pediatric patients, the authors suggest on using nonHD MTX regiment for Iran pediatric osteosarcoma patients.

PO-037 Survival of Patients with Childhood Osteosarcoma; A Single Center Experience R.E. Senay1, B. Yilmaz1, A.G. Tokuc Faculty, Paediatric haematology oncology, Istanbul, Turkey Background/Objectives: This study presents clinical outcome and midterm follow up of patients with childhood osteosarcoma with <90 % necrosis rate according to the presence of metastasis during initial diagnosis Design/Methods: Retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected single center database were evaluated. Thirty one patients with the diagnosis of osteosarcoma were enrolled between December 1995 and February 2017. Demographic variables, necrosis degree, rate of recurrence, rate of remission and survival were analyzed according to the presence of metastasis during the initial diagnosis Results: Patents age ranged between 519 years during The initial diagnosis, 17 (54.8%) of them were female and,14 (45.2%) of them were male. The mean followup period ranged between 4133 months ( with an average of 41,13 \u00b1 35 months). There were metastases in 5 cases (16,1%) and local invasion in 1 case (3,2%) during the initial diagnosis. Chemotherapy and surgical therapy was performed for each patient. The rate of necrosis ranged from 5% to 100% and it was 90% in 20 (64.5) patients. During the follow up period; recurrence was observed in 10 (32.3%) cases, mortality was observed in 9 (29%) and complete remission was detected in 22 (71%) of the cases. The fiveyears overall survival rate was 80.6% and mean survival time was 104.23 \u00b1 10.27 months (95% CI: 84.11124.36). There was no statistically significant difference in survival between groups those include presence of metastasis at the time of diagnosis and <90% necrosis in followup and nonmetastatic at the time of diagnosis and <90% necrosis in followup (p>0,05). Conclusions: These data shows 80% survival rate in midterm follow up. There has been no difference demonstrated in survival according to the presence of metastasis during the initial diagnosis. Solid Non Brain Tumours Soft Tissue Sarcomas PO-038 Transnasal Endoscopic Surgery in Complex Treatment of Esthesioneuroblastoma in Children D. Buletov1, O. Merkulov 2, T. Gorbunova2, V. Polyakov2 1Russian Cancer Research Center N.N. Blokhin, head and neck tumors, Moscow, Russia; 2Russian Cancer Research Center N.N. Blokhin, head and neck department, Moscow, Russia Background/Objectives: Esthesioneuroblastoma is a rare malignant tumor. The efficacy of transnasal endoscopic removal of the tumor in the treatment of adult patients ENB is not in doubt. However, the possibility of this type of surgical treatment of ENB in children has not been studied sufficiently. Design/Methods: From 2003 to 2016 the study included 11 patients. Mean patient age at diagnosis 9 years. Staging according to the TNMclassification. Stage I was determined at 2, III y 1, IV in 8 cases. Intracranial spread has been observed in 4 cases. 8 patients had got chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Chemotherapy was included from 6 to 10 courses: Vincristine 1 mg/m2 to 1 and Day 8, cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 to 1 and Day 8, doxorubicin 20 mg/m2 of 2 and 4 day carboplatin 360 mg/m2 of 1 day. Chemotherapy was administered in neoadjuvant regime 5 patients. Radiation therapy was performed in 8 patients in the 1.8 2.4/day. At the primary tumor RT 50.4 Gy was performed in 5 patients and further irradiated lymph nodes 40 Gy in 3. Complex therapy, including surgical treatment, carried out in 7 patients. Transnasal removal of the tumor was performed in 6 patients, of whom one of them to remove the tumor transnasal access was conducted twice, a second operation was performed for recurrent disease. Results: Currently, 6 patients (54.5%) lived from 3 months to 13 years. One patient withdrew from the study immediately after diagnosis. Died of tumor progression 4 (36.4%). Conclusions: Based on our data shows the effectiveness of integrated treatment of common stages of ENB in children. In all cases of transnasal endoscopic removal of the tumor reached radicalism. The promise of this type of treatment requires further study and definition of clear criteria for inclusion in the scheme and therapy protocols ENB children. PO-039 Transnasal Endoscopic Surgery in Complex Treatment of Soft Tissue Sarcomas in Children D. Buletov 1, O. Merkulov2, V. Polyakov2, T. Gorbunova2 1Russian Cancer Research Center N.N. Blokhin, head and neck tumors, Moscow, Russia; 2Russian Cancer Research Center N.N. Blokhin, head and neck department, Moscow, Russia Background/Objectives: Currently, the method of transnasal endoscopic surgery (TEC) is becoming increasingly popular in the treatment of nasal cavity, skull base and paramenegial localization. This work is the first experience of TEC in children with Malignant tumors in Russia Design/Methods: From 2015 to 2017 25 transnazal surgical operations were performed in 24 patients. 14 female patients, 10 male patients. In 16 cases, onestage tumor removal was performed, in 9 cases cytoreductive tumor resection (biopsy) was performed.The youngest patient at the time of the operation was 36 days. The oldest patient 17 years and 1 month.The histological composition lymphomas, angoimas, and others. 23 patients are alive at the moment, 1 patient died 3 months after the end of special treatment for estezioneeroblastoma Results: 23 patients are alive at the moment, 1 patient died 3 months after the end of special treatment for estezioneeroblastoma. Surgical complications: intraoperative cavernous sinus lesions 2. There were no complications in the postoperative period Conclusions: Endonasal surgery with the help of modern endoscopy techniques plays an important role both in the formulation of the diagnosis, and in the subsequent treatment and detection of relapses. In the modern world it is a method of choosing for treatment benign neoplasm, but also malignant neoplasms of the nasal cavity, the base of the skull and paramenengial localization. It is important to note that with the use of these modern technologies in patients of different ages, we have achieved the main goals of endoscopic interventions: complete visual control of performed manipulations; safety; preservation of the mucosa and anatomical structure; Minimal traumatism for the patient (absence of skin incisions); Easy tolerability in adults and children; The possibility to do without a long period of rehabilitation in the postoperative period. PO-040 Treatment of Head and Neck Malignant Rhabdoid Tumors with Combined Intensive Chemotherapy and 125I Particle Implantation: Report of 2 Cases FollowUp for Over 2.5 Years C. Duan 1, M. Jin1, X. Ma1, D. Zhang1, Background/Objectives: Malignant rhabdoid tumors(MRT) is a rare, highly aggressive pediatric malignancy that primarily develops during infancy and early childhood. Despite the existing standard of intensive multimodal therapy, the prognosis of patients with MRT is still dismal. To add to the current knowledge, here we report 2 cases of MRT in the head and neck region treated with anthracycline and platinumbased chemotherapy and brachytherapy. Design/Methods: The clinical records of 2 patients with head and neck MRT treated in Beijing Children's Hospital between Oct 2011 and May 2014 were retrospectively studied. Results: The medical records of two boys, onset age of 1.2y and 4.5y respectively were studied. One patient with primary tumor site at the right neck, another patient with the primary tumor site at the left neck, and metastasis to the right nasopharynx and multiple facial bones. The primary tumors size were 8*8cm and 6*6 cm respectively, were all stage III, and were all unresectable. Immunohistochemical results showed that the INI1 were all negative. They were treated with chemotherapy after biopsies were done. The chemotherapy protocol was as follows: vincristine, 4,10,16,22,28. 125I particle implantations were done after 5 and 6 cycles of chemotherapy respectively. The evaluation showed very good partial remission of the tumor after the treatment completed. Both patients had IV grade neutropenia, III degree anemiaand thrombocytopenia.Both patients suffered from grade 12 skin reaction after seed implantation, manifested as erythema or mild edema of the local skin, which can be improved within 12 weeks. Now the followup time were 64 month and 34 month respectively, and the two patients remained stable. Conclusions: Anthracycline and platinumbased intensive chemotherapy combined with 125I particle implantation may be a promising treatment option for extrarenal, extracranial MRT without distant metastasis. PO-041 Outcome of Bone and Soft Tissue Sarcomas in Children at a Tertiary Care Center in Pakistan Z. Fadoo 1, S. Resham1, N. Mushtaq1, karachi, Pakistan; 2Aga Khan university, Pediatrics and Child Health, Karachi, Pakistan Background/Objectives: There is paucity of data regarding demographic characteristics and outcomes of bone and soft tissue sarcomas from the developing world including Pakistan. We analyzed the clinical features, and outcome of children with bone and soft tissue sarcomas treated over last 10 years at Aga Khan University Hospital. Design/Methods: Records of patients treated from January 2005 to December 2015 at Aga Khan University Hospital, histologically confirmed diagnosis of bone and soft tissue sarcomas were reviewed. KaplanMeier curves were created to assess overall survival (OS) and event free survival (EFS) with relapse and death as outcome. Results: Forty three patients were eligible. 27(62.7%) were bone tumors with 13(48.1%) osteosarcoma, and 14(51.8%) with synovial each There were 11/43(25.5%) patients with metastatic disease, 4 osteosarcomas, 4 ewings and 3 rhabdomyosarcoma respectively. The median age for bone sarcoma was 12 years while soft tissue sarcoma was 6 years. Distal Femur was the most involved site 10/27 (37%) in bone tumors and parameningeal 4/12 (33%) was the most common site in rhabdomyosarcoma. There were 6/43 (13.9%) patients who received minimal to no therapy. There were 10/43 (23%) relapses on therapy. The estimated 5year EFS was 43.4% (95%CI: 9.8%73.9%) and OS at was 54.7% (95%CI: 23.9%77.6%). Conclusions: Outcomes of sarcomas in the developing world are poor due to multiple factors. Delayed presentation, poor tolerance of therapy, poor nutritional status at baseline, abandonment of therapy and lack of easy access to medical care due to financial constraints are some of the major factors responsible. PO-042 Treatment Results in Pediatric Head and Neck Rhabdomyosarcomas: A Single Center Experience K. Mutafoglu1, D. nce 1, D. Kizmazoglu1, Y. Olgun2, M. Erdem1, Demiral3, Izmir, Turkey; 2Dokuz Izmir, Turkey; 3Dokuz Eylul University Oncology, Izmir, Turkey; 4Dokuz Eylul Izmir, Turkey; 5Dokuz Eylul University Faculty of Medicine, Dept. of Pathology, Izmir, Turkey Background/Objectives: To evaluate head and neck localized rhabdomyosarcomas in our center. Design/Methods: Medical records of 32 patients with head and neck localized RMS between 19882016, analyzed retrospectively. Results: The median age of diagnosis was 6.5yrs (18 mos17 yrs),M/F:1.0. Localization of surgery was performed for three patients. All other patients received chemotherapy as the initial treatment. IRS based treatment regimens were used in 24 patients, COG ARST0431 protocol was used for other 8 patients. RTwas given to all the primary sites except two who were lost to follow up. Total resection with secondary surgery was performed for one patient with cheek primary because of chemo and radioresistant tumor. The median followup time was 33 mos (2 mos17 yrs). Four patients were lost to follow up at 8th month with disease (n:3) and at 37th month without disease (n:1). 3yrsOS rate was 76%, 5and10yrs OS rates were 71%. rate was 63%, and 5, 10yrsEFS rates were 58%. Totally 7 patients died with progressive disease at median 26 months (1049 mos). Two patients died with refractory and progressive disease at 10 months. Nine patients relapsed. Median relapse time was 19mos (640 mos). Three patients with relapsed disease are alive and relapse treatment is going on. A treatment resistant patient is alive after second line surgery with NED. Five patients with relapsed disease died with progression despite anticancer treatment. Conclusions: Fourty percent of patients had advanced stage disease, 91% of patients were in clinical group 34, local control was problem. Overall and event free survival rates were acceptable. PO-043 Successful Treatment of Tandem HighDose Chemotherapy with Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation in Advanced Ewing Sarcoma T. Miyamura 1, Y. Hashii1, H. Yoshida1, T. Fujiwara1, K. Ozono1 1Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Pediatrics, Osaka, Japan; 2Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Orthopedic surgery, Osaka, Japan; 3Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Radiology, Osaka, Japan Background/Objectives: Ewing sarcoma (ES) is a rare malignancy of bone and soft tissue. The prognosis of advanced metastatic ES remains very poor and treatment strategy has not been established. We report two cases of advanced ES treated by tandem highdose chemotherapy with allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). They survived without disease for more than 4 years, therefore it may be an effective treatment strategy for advanced ES. Design/Methods: Patient 1 was a 15yearold girl with ES originating in right ilium with multiple lung metastases. Patient 2 was an 11yearold girl with ES originating in left ilium with multiple lung metastases. They received multidrug chemotherapy and radiation therapy to the primary legion. We then performed first highdose chemotherapy (VP16/CBDCA/CY) with autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT). They underwent surgical resection of primary lesion after hematological recovery. Their treatment response were good, and they achieved complete response. After that, we performed second highdose chemotherapy (CY/LPAM) with allogeneic SCT. The donor of patient 1 was HLAmatched sibling, and severe adverse event including GVHD was not detected. The donor of patient 2 was HLA 2 loci mismatched mother (KIR ligand mismatch). Moderate engraftment syndrome was occurred although severe GVHD was not detected. Results: Patients 1 and 2 survived without disease for 70 months and 54 months, respectively. Conclusions: We reported two cases of advanced ES treated with multidrug chemotherapy and local radiation therapy, plus tandem highdose chemotherapy with autologous and allogeneic stem cell rescue. They survived without disease progression for more than 4 years. It was reported that ES can express tumor antigens which can be recognized by T cells, making allogeneic SCT an effective option. Intensive highdose tandem chemotherapy with alkylating agents and allogeneic tumor immunotherapy could be an effective treatment strategy for advanced ES. Solid Non Brain Tumours Retinoblastoma PO-044 Evaluation of Retinoblastoma Patients Undergoing Enucleation in the Backdrop of IIRB and AJCC TNM Classification; Clinical Features and 5 Year Outcome Analysis A. alkofide 1, H. Katan2, M. Center, Pediatric Hematology riyadh, Saudi Arabia; Khaled Medcial College, Riyadh, Arabia; 4King Faisal Specialist Hopsital & Research Center, Oncology Center, riyadh, Saudi Arabia Background/Objectives: To determine the clinical profile and outcome of patients with Retinoblastoma (Rb) who underwent unilateral or bilateral enucleation in the backdrop of International intraocular retinoblastoma classification (ABC Classification) and TNM Staging System. Design/Methods: Medical charts of 58 pediatric (Age14 years) patients with retinoblastoma who underwent enucleation, treated at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre (KFSHRC), and King Khaled Eye Specialist Hospital Riyadh, Saudi Arabia from 20122016 were reviewed Results: Among the cohort, 51.7% (30) were female. Median age at diagnosis was 20.5 months (397.8). Retinoblastoma was unilateral in 51.7% (30), bilateral in 44.8% (26) and trilateral in 3.4(2) patients. One (1.7%) had metastatic disease at presentation. 61 enucleations were performed in 58 patients. International Classification for Intraocular Retinoblastoma was carried out for all eyes. 43 (70.5%) were in Group E, 11(18%) Group D, 3(4.9%) Group C and A each, followed by 1 (1.6%) in Group B. All patients underwent chemotherapy as chemoreduction and/or chemoprevention. 52 (85.2%) received chemoreduction and IIRB was available on 46 patients. 9 (19.5%) of our T1, T2a patients were classified as Stage D or Stage E. Postenucleation 17.2% (10) of our patients received External Beam Orbital Radiotherapy (EBORT). Of 44 evaluable cases, 93.2% (41) were in CR, 4.5(2) had stable disease and remaining 2.3% (1) progressive disease. With 3 (5.2%) mortalities (2 with bilateral, 1 with unilateral tumor), probability of five year overall survival for the whole cohort was 93% (0.930\u00b10.040); 94.5% (0.945\u00b10.038) for Group E and 80% (0.800\u00b10.179) for Group D. Conclusions: The IIRB is essential in making decision about enucleation however, TNM Classification plays a pivotal role in deciding on postenucleation treatment for RB patients to avoid over treatment. PO-045 Are Bone Marrow Examination and Lumbar Puncture Necessary in the Initial Evaluation of Retinoblastoma? Singapore, Singapore Background/Objectives: Retinoblastoma is the commonest primary intraocular malignancy of childhood. Bone marrow examination and lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology are done together with EUA as initial metastatic work up for all patients with retinoblastoma in our institution. However, this is not routinely practiced in some centres. This retrospective study aims to determine the prevalence of metastasis at diagnosis and to evaluate the value of these investigations in patients with retinoblastoma treated in KK Women's and Children's Hospital, Singapore (KKH). Design/Methods: The study was approved by Singhealth Centralized Institutional Review Board. Retrospective analysis of patients with retinoblastoma from May 1997 to March 2017 was performed. Results: Seventyeight patients were included; 38 (48.7%) boys, 40 (51.3%) girls. Fortyfive (57.7%) had unilateral disease, 32 (41%) bilateral disease and 1 (1.3%) trilateral disease. Median age at presentation was 25 months (range 1 to 107 months) for unilateral disease and 13 months (range 3 to 24 months) for bilateral disease. Two (2.6%) patients had positive family history. Four (5.1%) patients had metastatic disease at presentation to KKH. One had CSF (Cut optic nerve showed involvement) and one had bone marrow involvement (Blood count was abnormal) at diagnosis. One had initial treatment overseas and presented to KKH with metastatic relapse in bone marrow, CSF, liver and bone. The 4th patient had suprasellar extension on MRI but no CSF positivity. Costs for bone marrow and lumbar puncture tests were SGD 2500 to 3000 (USD 1785 to 2142). Conclusions: The prevalence of metastasis at diagnosis is very low at our institution. The patients with metastasis can be picked up by other means like clinical examination, blood counts, MRI and histology of optic nerve involvement. It is not necessary to investigate all patients with retinoblastoma, thus saving substantial financial and time costs for our patients and institution. PO-046 Clinicoradiologic Features of Retinoblastoma at National Institute of Child Health Karachi, Pakistan U. Imam 1, F. Ali1 1Child Aid Associationnational Institute Of Child Health, Pediatric Oncology, Karachi, Pakistan Background/Objectives: Retinoblastoma is a primary intra ocular neoplasm of childhood which is presented at a very young age with leukocoria. This study aims to determine the clinico radiological features of retinoblastoma over a period of nine years from 2007 to 2015 using existing hospital record sheets. Design/Methods: A record of 176 children with retinoblastoma derived from hospital sheets treated at Pediatric Oncology department of National Institute of Child Health, Karachi from January 2007 to December 2015 using specially designed Performa after informed consent from parents. Results: Out of 176 patients with Retinoblastoma, 99 (56%) were male and 77 (44%) were females, age range was 2 120 months, average (mean \u00b1 S.D.) age was 42 \u00b1 21.1 months. 50% clinically presented with orbital proptosis. 69.8% of children were referred from outside Karachi. Bilateral disease was significantly high in children below 2 years of age (31.6%) as compared to children above 2 years (11.5%) P< 0.05. Family history of Retinoblastoma was negative in all children with bilateral tumors. There was a mean time lag of 11.8 months between appearance of first symptom and consultation with the Oncologist. 24.4% patients were referred with tumor recurrence after primary enucleation and its frequency was high in children above 5 years of age [10 (52.6%) out of 19 children] as compared to patients below 5 years [33 (21.0%) out of 157 children] (p<0.01).56 patients (32 %) had metastatic disease and CNS involvement was noticed in 39 patients. Conclusions: High frequency of advanced stage disease suggests late referrals to the treatment facility and a significant percentage of children were registered with tumor recurrence, these findings reflect lack of multidisciplinary approach in patient management. Therefore, integrated efforts are needed to create awareness among masses and healthcare personnel for early referrals and uniformity in patient evaluation and management. PO-047 Effective Parameters at Diagnosis and Relation of Clinical Stage of the Disease in Children with Retinoblastoma E. Unal Cabi 1, D. Kavlak \u00dcniversity Faculty of Medicine, Ophthalmology, Ankara, Turkey Background/Objectives: RB cases are diagnosed in advanced intraocular stages and with orbital /metastatic disease in Turkey.We aimed to determine the duration of diagnosis & the parameters that affect this period, with the relation to clinical stage. Design/Methods: We enrolled 100 RB patients. The data obtained through a survey of the families. Patients' files were reviewed for the clinical stage, exact date of diagnosis, starting date of treatment, which can not be obtained from the family. In the questionnaire addressed to the parents; the parameters that could be effective during the clinical diagnosis & stage were questioned. The duration between detection of first symptom and diagnosis were evaluated with dividing into parts such as patient related delayed diagnosis, delayed diagnosis due to the doctor and delayed treatment. Results: The age of diagnosis 21day5 years, with median 11mos. Common finding was leucocoria in 59% & strabismus in 32% of patients. Family related delay of diagnosis was 2450 days. median 9 days, doctor related 0 416 days, median 5,5 days. The total diagnosis delay range 3640 days median of 42.5days. The eyes were Group E 44%, Group D 16.5%,19% Group C, 13% Group B 7,5%Group A. 64% of patients underwent enucleation in group E & the delay in diagnosis was longer than the other groups. In the families with low SES patientrelated diagnosis delay was higher than patientrelated diagnosis delay in families with high SES Familial RB retinoblastoma patients were diagnosed at an earlier stage,3%,71%,23% and 3% of the patients were diagnosed by first,second, third, fourth ophthalmologist, respectively. Conclusions: In our study, the delay time of RB diagnosis was shorter than some studies. However, more than half of our patients were diagnosed at advanced intraocular stages. We think that the most important and effective parameters in delayed diagnosis are insufficient awareness of families and especially healthcare workers. Solid Non Brain Tumours Liver Tumours PO-048 Localized Focal Nodular Hyperplasia of Liver in Children, 9 Cases, 5 Years Experiences W. han 1 1Beijing Children's Hospital, Department of Surgical Oncology, Bei Jing, China Background/Objectives: To evaluate the clinical diagnosis and treatment of focal nodular hyperplasia(FNH) in children of liver. Design/Methods: 9 cases of focal nodular hyperplasia of liver confirmed by operation and pathology in our hospital from 2006 to 2012 were investigated retrospectively. Results: The age of onset ranged from 111 years old. Primary clinical manifestation: 3 cases for fever, 1 case for vomiting, 1 case for abnormal liver function, 1 case for abdominal distension, 2 cases for abdominal pain, 1 case for intussusception, 1 case for tumor family history (lung cancer). All lesions were found by imaging.3 cases of alphafetoprotein (AFP) measuring mildly elevated, 6 cases were normal, 1 case of HCG increased, 8 cases were normal. Hepatitis B virus infection of 1 patient was positive. Pathological performance of 9 cases were typical, all patients underwent gross surgical resection, no complications and death postoperatively as well as perioperatively. AFP decreased to normal after surgery in 3 cases, the other two cases were not investigated. Liver function abnormality ameliorated after surgery. 510 year followup, all patients survived with event free. Conclusions: The genetic predisposition of FNH is not obvious. The disease can lead to abnormal liver function and AFP. The misdiagnosis is common although not fatal. Surgical resection is important for treatment also for ruling out the other malignancy of liver. PO-049 LivingRelated Transplantation of a Liver in Children with Hepatoblastoma A. Ijovskyi1, O. Kotenko2, G. Klymnyuk3, O. Grinenko2, D. Fedorov2, A. Korshak2 1National Institute MPH of Ukraine, Pediatric Oncology, Kiev, Ukraine; 2National Institute of Surgery and Transplantology named after O.O. Shalymov, Liver Transplantation, Kiev, Ukraine; 3National Cancer Institute, Department of Pediatric Oncology, Kiev, Ukraine; 4National Cancer Institute, Pediatric Oncology, Kiev, Ukraine Background/Objectives: Malignant liver tumors make 1 - 2% of a number of all tumors of the child age, with yearly incidence of 1,5 cases per million of children aged up to 15 years. Design/Methods: At the posthoc analysis as of from 2008 to 2014 in Ukraine at the stage of surgical treatment of hepatoblastomas in children 7 livingrelated transplantations of a liver were performed, among them: orthotopic transplantation of the lateral section of a liver from the live relative donor (mother) was executed to five patients at the stage of surgical treatment, to one patient hepatectomy, transplantation of the left lateral section of the liver from the live relative donor (mother) with cava portal transposition, and the transplantation concerning recurrence of hepatoblastoma after leftsided expanded hepatectomy was executed to one patient. Average age of children to whom the livingrelated transplantation of a liver was carried out made 2,7 years. Chemotherapy according to the clinical protocol SIOPEL 3 was carried out to all patients, group of high risk. Results: The average time of the execution of the operation made 14,5 hours. In the postoperative period biloma of the resective surface of the graft developed in 1 patient, it was removed by way of ultrasoundcontrolled puncture. Complete remission of the disease was recorded in all 7 patients to whom livingrelated transplantation of the liver was executed. The fiveyear survival rate of patients with hepatoblastoma to whom transplantation of the liver was executed makes 100%, the fiveyear survival of the graft made 100%. Conclusions: Executing the livingrelated transplantation of a liver in children with hepatoblastoma of a liver is a difficult stage of multimodality therapy demanding considerable material and technical support and it allows to achieve good remote results statistically authentically. Solid Non Brain Tumours Germ Cell Tumours PO-050 CCHE Experience in High Risk Malignant Extracranial Pediatric Germ Cell Tumors O. Arafah 1,2, S. Ahmad1,2, Taha3, M. D. Institute.

Cairo, Egypt; 657357 Hospital. Cairo, Radiodiagnosis, Cairo, Egypt; 757357 Hospital. Cairo, Clinical Trial Unit, Cairo, Egypt; 857357 Hospital. Cairo, Clinical Research, Cairo, Egypt Background/Objectives: Suboptimal outcomes remain for several groups of patients with malignant extracranial germ cell tumors (MGCTs), including patients with extragonadal tumors, advanced and metastatic diseases. Future studies should be directed toward intensifying therapy for those poor risk groups with long term follow up for late effects. Design/Methods: High risk patients with MGCTs treated at CCHE were retrospectively analysed for epidemiological and survival outcomes. They were treated according to the protocol adopted from AGCT01P1 for high risk from July 2007 till end of December 2015. All patients were followed up until June 2016. Results: 75 out of 122 eligible patients with MGCTs were high risk. Mean age was 4.8 years with male to female ratio 1:4. Extragonadal tumors were 56 cases (42 females and 14 males), versus 19 ovarian cases. Sacrococcygeal sites predominates in females while mediastinal followed by sacrococcygeal sites predominates in males. Main histological types in extragonadal cases were Yolk sac tumor followed by Mixed GCT and Germinoma. Main histological types in ovarian cases were Dysgerminoma followed by Yolk sac tumor and Mixed GCT. In Extragonadal sites, Five years OS were 77.8 % and 62.8 % for stage III and IV respectively while Five years EFS were 74.3 % and 67.8 % for stage III and IV respectively. In ovarian cases, Five years OS and EFS were 100% for stage III and 33.3% for stage IV. No significant P value in five years OS and EFS between those below 11 years of age and above. Conclusions: Poor outcome for high risk (MGCTs) necessitates more intensified therapy especially for metastatic tumors. Improved risk stratification systems, novel approaches and more efficient salvage protocols are needed to improve the outcome of those poor risk patients. PO-051 Primary Retroperitoneal/Abdominal Germ Cell Tumour in Children: Challenges S. kumar2, R.N. rao3 1Sanjay Paediatric Surgical Superspeciality, Lucknow, India; 2Sanjay Gandhi Medical Sciences, Radiodiagnosis, Lucknow, India; 3Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Pathology, Lucknow, India Background/Objectives: Primary extragonadal germ cell tumours are rare and account for only 1 - 4% of all germ cell tumours. Prognosis is usually excellent after complete excision but perioperative management is a distinct challenge. Aim of this study is to present perioperative problems and morbidity associated with management of these tumours. Design/Methods: We retrospectively evaluated the patients having nonrenal retroperitoneal/abdominal masses from July, 2012 to July, 2016 at our centre from hospital records with diagnosis of germ cell tumour. Details of patients were reviewed including demography, clinical presentations, investigations, perioperative problems, pathology, management, final outcome and followup. Results: From July, 2012 to July, 2016, 11 patients with retroperitoneal/abdominal germ cell tumour were managed. Diagnoses were yolk sac tumour (YST) in 3 patients and teratoma in 8 patients. 4 patients were female and age ranged from 2.5 months to 6 years (median age 14 months). 2 patients had respiratory problems while 3 had sub acute bowel obstructions at the time of presentation. Patients with YSTs and 2 patients with immature teratoma received chemotherapy. Almost complete excision performed in all patients. Perioperative problems include excessive bleeding (2), excision of part of adjacent organ (2), hypothermia and respiratory problems and chemo related toxicity (1). Adhesive bowel obstructions occurred in 5 patients with in 3 month of post surgery in which 4 required reexplorations and adhesiolysis. 2 patients were died while 2 were lost in followup. Rest patients are under followup without recurrence. Followup period ranged from 6 - 45 months. Conclusions: The management of retroperitoneal/abdominal germ cell tumour (GCT) is challenge. Various surgical difficulties and morbidity associated with resection of these tumours depends on clinical presentation, size and site of tumour and age of patient. PO-052 Twenty Years' Experience in the Management of Childhood Germ Cell Tumors R.E. Senay1, O. Dogru1, A.G. Tokuc 1, N. University Medical Faculty, Paediatric Oncology, Istanbul, Turkey Background/Objectives: Germ cell tumors (GCT) account for 23% of childhood tumors. It is most commonly seen under 3 years and over 12 years old. GCTs are most commonly localized in the gonads. We have examined our patients who diagnosed and treated with GCT at our center retrospectively. Design/Methods: Sixty two children and adolescence who were diagnosed and treated with GCT at our center between 1996 and 2016 analyzed retrospectively. Results: The patients age ranged between 5 days to 17 years. Thirtyfive of patients were girls (57%) and 27 were boys (43%). The most common tumor localization with 29(47%) patients was gonads. Sixteen patients (25,8%) had metastatic disease at presentation. The most common histologic subtype was mature teratoma with 14 (22%) patients and 14 patients (22%) with yolk sac tumor. Alphafetoprotein (AFP) was elevated in 29 (46%) of cases whereas betahuman chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) was elevated in only 4 (4%) of cases. Twentytwo cases (35%) were treated with total surgical resection and they didn't receive chemotherapy. Six patients (10%) received radiotherapy in addition to surgery and chemotherapy. Thirtythree patients (53,3 %) received BEP (bleomycin, etoposide, cisplatin) as a first line chemotherapy. During the follow up 6 (10 %) patients had relapsed. Five years overall survival rate of our patients was 95%, retrospectively. Conclusions: Germ cell tumors have favorable outcome in children. These tumors can be cured with surgical resection followed by cisplatinbased chemotherapy and radiotherapy for selected patients. As a result of our own data analysis, it has been found that our survival rates are similar to current literature data. Solid Non Brain Tumours Rare Tumours PO-053 Intracranial Reunion, Reunion; 2Chu F\u00e9lix Guyon, Pediatric Surgery, Saint Denis Pediatric Department, Mamoudzou, Mayotte Background/Objectives: Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors (IMT) are rare tumors in children and young adults, considered to be intermediate malignancies and rarely metastasizing. About 50% of IMT present an anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement. We report the case of a 15yearold girl, who developed a lung tumor and brain metastasis with a limited ALK amplification, who was treated with crizotinib. Design/Methods: In December 2015, the patient arrived in Mayotte hospital for cough and hemoptysis for one year. She also had 2 seizures after her arrival. Radiological thoracic explorations showed a 9cm tumor in the left inferior lobe and brain MRI showed five gadoliniumenhancing brain lesions, especially one of 6.5cm in the frontal lobe. Microscopic partial brain tumor resection was performed. The pulmonary tumor was completely removed by lobectomy. Both pathological exams showed an IMT negative for ROS1 but overexpressing ALK with a rearranged form in 12 to 15% of cells. Steroids (2mg/kg) alone during 2 weeks and then chemotherapy (Methotrexate/Vinblastine) were introduced but did not improve neurological lesions. Crizotinib was initiated as compassionate at a dose of 250mg twice daily. Results: Crizotinib is a chemical inhibitor of ALK and mesenchymalepithelial transition, but it also inhibits ROS1rearranged tyrosine kinase receptors. It has been shown to be effective in non-smallcell lung carcinoma and has also been tested successfully in other ALKdriven tumors, notably largecell anaplastic lymphoma and certain paediatric cancers. Previous reports suggested that crizotinib cannot cross the bloodbrain barrier and may be unable to control CNS IMT. In this case, complete remission on brain metastasis was achieved after 6 weeks of crizotinib despite multiple brain localizations and low ALK positive tumor cells rate. No recurrence of thoracic nor brain lesion was observed after a year. Conclusions: This case suggests that ALKtargeted therapy by crizotinib may strengthen current strategies against IMTs, even in CNS tumors. PO-054 Treatment of Kaposiform Hemangioendothelioma with KasabachMerritt Phenomenon by Corticosteroids and Vincristine: Experience of the Children's Hospital 1, Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam T. Nguyen 1, A. Phan1 1Children's Hospital 1, HematologyOncology, Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam Background/Objectives: Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma (KHE) is a rare vascular tumor with over 70% of cases associated with KasabachMerritt phenomenon (KMP), a lifethreatening constellation of thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy and purpura. We reported the results of corticosteroids and vincristine in the management of KHE with KMP. Design/Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of patients with KHE and KMP who were treated with corticosteroids and vincristine at Children's Hospital 1, Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam from January 2013 to December 2015. Results: Six cases, median age 3 months (116 months) with a male:female ratio of 1:1 were treated by corticosteroids and vincristine. All patients had large KHE developing from the lumbar region (33.3%), extremities (33.3%), face (16.7%) and purpura (16.7%), infection and ulceration at the hemangioendothelioma (16.7%) and acute respiratory distress due to the presence of tumoral compression (33.3%). At diagnosis, the median platelet count and levels was 10.5x109/L (417x109/L) and 0.8 g/L (0.60.9 g/L) The duration corticosteroid therapy was 23\u00b16 weeks. Vincristine was given intravenously at 0.05 mg/kg per dose weekly for four times, followed by monthly for six times. Only one out of 6 patients with partial response had to use vincristine for 9 months. The rates of complete, partial and no response were 50% (3/6 cases), 33.3% (2/6 cases) and 16.7% (1/6 cases) respectively with a median followup of 15 months. The platelet counts normalized after 3.6 \u00b11.2 weeks. Fibrinogen levels returned to normal after 3.3\u00b10.8 weeks. Reduction in size of the tumor by 50% was achieved after 4.2\u00b10.5 weeks, and by 80% after 27.2\u00b18.9 weeks. The recurrence rate of KMP was 33.3% (2/6 cases). Vincristine had mild and transient side effects compared to corticosteroids. Conclusions: Firstline therapy with corticosteroids and vincristine is one of the options for unresectable KHE with KMP. Solid Non Brain Tumours Histiocytosis PO-055 A Case of Juvenile Xanthogranuloma Involving Bone Marrow During Treatment of A PreB Acute Lymphoblatic Leukemia J.E. Park 1, O.K. Noh2 1Ajou School of Medicine, Pediatrics, Suwon, Republic of Korea; 2Ajou University School of Medicine, Radiation Onvology, Suwon, Republic of Korea Background/Objectives: Juvenile xanthogranuloma (JXG) is a rare benign disorder which is one of the diseases classified as nonLangerhans cell histiocytosis, whose etiology and pathogenesis is still unclear. JXG is generally characterized by solitary or multiple cutaneous nodules which resolve spontaneously over a few years. However, it is uncommonly possible to present extracutaneous disorder and progress symptomatic systemic disorder through involving multiple organs. Design/Methods: We review the chart a case of systemic JXG involving bone marrow, multiple bone and skin during treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Results: The adolescent patient suffered unexplained prolonged fever, scalp pain, hip joint pain, and right knee joint pain for 2 weeks during treatment in the course of interim maintenance chemotherapy. According to the pathologic findings of bone marrow, there is no evidence of leukemia relapse but finding diffuse infiltration of histiocytes with several Toutontype giant cells; positive for CD68, negative for CD1a, S100 protein. Bone and skin biopsies confirmed the same findings. Symptoms have been resolved since maintenance chemotherapy which included vincristine, dexamethasone, 6mercaptopurine and methotrexate. Bone marrow involvement of JXG is very rare and has been reported to occur only less than 1 year of age, but this case is reported in 16yearsold boy during acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment. Conclusions: We experienced a systemic JXG involving bone marrow, multiple bone and skin during treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Brain Tumours PO-056 Tumors of the Central Nervous System in the First Year of Life. One Single Institution Experience M. GarciaAriza 1, A. Echebarria Barona1, R. LopezAlmaraz1, Spain Background/Objectives: Central nervous system (CNS) tumors in the first year of life are a very specific pediatric brain tumor group, with difficulties in the diagnosis and treatment. They associate a worse prognosis and more sequelae compared to older children. We reviewed our series and experience. Design/Methods: A retrospective study of infants under one year of life diagnosed with CNS tumors from 2001 to 2016. Clinical, histological, treatment and sequelae data were collected. Results: Fourteen infants were identified. Males were 57%. Median age at diagnosis was 6 months (range 010). Most were supratentorial and without dissemination (93% in both cases). No CSF was positive. Astrocytic tumors represented the largest group of tumors (50%), most of them were low grade glioma (71%). 7% respectively. No ependymal tumor included surgery (partial chemotherapy (HDCH) 7%. No radiation therapy was administered in any case. Survival was 57% with a median follow up of 30 months. Among the survivors, the most frequent sequelae were neurological (75%) and ophthalmological (62.5%). Only in one case there was no sequel. Conclusions: In our review, survival in infants diagnosed with CNS tumors in the first year of life was 57%, and significant sequelae were observed. Localized supratentorial masses without dissemination was the most common presentation but neurosurgical procedures achieved complete resection in only 21%. Radiotherapy was avoided. Management of CNS tumors at this age is more complicated. The role of HDCH remains to be defined. PO-057 Diffuse Leptomeningeal Glioneuronal Tumour: A Case Report J. Messahel1, K. Allinson2 of Paediatric Oncology, Cambridge, United Kingdom; 2Addenbrookes Hospital, Department of Pathology, Cambridge, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: Diffuse leptomeningeal glioneuronal tumor (DLGNT) is a rare brain tumor with a distinct molecular profile and aggressive biological behavior. These lesions often present with insidious onset and can progress rapidly leading to death with a median survival reported as 22 months. The natural history of this rare entity is not fully understood. Design/Methods: We describe a rare case of DLGNT diagnosed on post mortem. A 23 month old boy presented with weight loss and vomiting. A MRI of the head and spine demonstrated extensive leptomeningeal spread in the spinal and intracranial compartments, suggestive of a neoplastic process. A leptomeningeal biopsy revealed a low grade primary glial lesion. There were no operative options and he was therefore commenced on treatment on the SIOP LGG2 Study. However he demonstrated progressive disease in spite of chemotherapy both radiologically and clinically with loss of speech and seizures. He later developed hydrocephalus and a ventriculoperitoneal shunt was inserted. He deteriorated and passed away at the age of 4 years. Results: The macroscopic, histological and molecular findings were characteristic of diffuse leptomeningeal gioneuronal tumour. Immunohistochemically, the tumour cells for CD34, NeuN, GFAP and mutant IDH1. The MIB1 proliferation than 1%. Interphase fluorescent in situ hybridisation (iFISH) showed a concurrent BRAFKIAA1549 gene fusion and loss of 1p36. Conclusions: This case demonstrates the need for biological markers to be integrated with clinicpathological markers in order for both diagnostic and prognostic risk stratification. PO-058 Retrospective Analysis of Our Patients with Pons Glioma D. NCE 1, D. Kizmazoglu1, M. Erdem1, A. Demiral2, Olgun1 Izmir, Turkey; 2Dokuz Eylul Oncology, Izmir, Turkey; 3Dokuz Eylul University Faculty of Medicine, Dept. of Radiodiagnostics, Izmir, Turkey Background/Objectives: To evaluate characteristics and treatment responses of with diffuse pons glioma in our center Design/Methods: Medical files of patients with malignant CNS tumors between 19872017 were analyzed retrospectively. There were 23 patients with pons glioma. Three of them went to another center, one of them diagnosed as demyelinizan disease and other one as encephelatic lesion laterly. These 5 patients excluded and 18 patients found evaluable. Results: The median age at diagnosis was 7 yrs (2.618yrs), M/F:1.25. Age distrubution: <5 yrs 4 patients, 510 yrs 8 patients, 1018 yrs 6 patients. The most frequent complaints: cranial nerve paralysis (61%), visial impairment (56%), headache (44%), power loss (44%) and speech disorder (%33). Surgery was performed to extrinsic component of mass in 3 patients. Sixteen patients received radiotherapy. Two patients died before RT, on 2th week and sixth month. RT total doses varied between 5060 Gy. Thirteen patients were received chemotherapy, four patients died before chemo, an one patient is still receiving RT. Chemotherapy protocoles were changed over the years: in five patients, oral cyclophosphamide in one patient, temozolamide in one patient and bevacizumab in one patient. Median progression free survival rate was 6mos (2weeks 18mos). Progression free survival rate for 6mos was 82%, for one year was 22%, for 18mos was 0%. Median dead time was 9.5mos (2 weeks2yrs). One year, 18mos, and two years overall survival rates were 52%, 39% and 13% respectively. Conclusions: Diffuse pons glioma is a group of tumor in which the helplessness experienced in treatment. Despite radiotherapy and chemotherapy, patients are still dying. The progression free and overall survival rates of patients were similar to literature. But we need new therapy agents which will improve the progression free survival rates. PO-059 Into CancerFree World with the Use of Mitotic Crossing Over Inhibitors P. Ivanovski 1, L. Garavelli2, I. Ivanovski2, A. Ivanovski3 1Children's University Serbia; 2Arcispedale Santa Maria NuovaIRCCS Reggio Emilia Italy., Clinical Genetics Department of Obstetrics and Pediatrics, Reggio Emilia, Italy; 3University of Belgrade, Chemical Faculty, Belgrade, Achivment of new SIOP mission: No Child Shoud Contract Cancer. Design/Methods: A comprehensive reading of papers on cancer epidemiology and pathogenesis, and creating an own theory for cancer prevention. Results: There are no literature data about neoplasms which originate from terminally differentiated cells (TDCs) such as Purkinje neurons, Betz neurons, and alpha motoneurons. This indicates that carcinogenesis cannot occur in cells not having mitotic potential, and consequently there is no mitotic crossing over (MCO) and no loss of heterozygosity (LOH), a mechanism responsible for the disabling of tumor suppressor genes. All known cancers so far, have been derived from cells possessing mitotic activity. Cancer is just a \"privilege\" of these cells. Larger body cell burden, longer life, means more mitoses, more MCO, more LOH and greater chances for cancer development. Li-Fraumeni syndrome(LFS) is a rare, autosomal dominant, hereditary disorder that predisposes carriers to cancer development, because of germline heterozygous TP53 mutation. This mutation is present in all body cells, including TDCs. Classical and most frequent LFS malignancies are sarcomas, cancers of the breast, brain (especially glioblastomas), adrenocortical carcinoma, leukemias and lymphomas. Despite exaggerated predisposition for cancer development, no cancer originating from TDCs has been seen in LFS persons, so far. In all malignant cells of all tumors in LFS, homozygous TP53 mutation (LOH at TP53) is present, which is generated by MCO events during mitoses of the cells. Conclusions: Experiments on TP53+/ mice (an animal LFS model) must be done, protecting the mice with MCO inhibitors (rad51, rad52, rad53 inhibitors, commercially available). If these experiments result in cancer prevention, then the scientists must search for MCO inhibitor which would be orally supplemented to all humans during the life. Presently, the drug of choice is Acidum Acetylsalicylicum. Before its use as cancer chemoprevention, the molecule must be modified, to be eliminated its hemorrhagic side effects. PO-060 Treatment Results of Who Grade III Ependymomas at EGE University Hospital A. Sahin1, M. Kantar 1, H. Hekimci Ozdemir1, Y. Anacak2, Turhan3 1Ege Medicine, Pediatrics Pediatric Oncology Division, Izmir, Turkey; 2Ege University School of Medicine, Radiation University School of Medicine, Pediatric Neurosurgery, Izmir, Turkey Background/Objectives: Prognosis of grade III ependymoma changed over the years, and requires multiinstitutional approach. In this analysis we aimed to analyze demographic features and treatment results of anaplastic ependymoma at our institution. Design/Methods: Thirteen patients aged mean 78 months (30192) were diagnosed to have WHO grade III ependymoma after surgery. There were 7 female, 6 male. Tumor location was infratentorial and spinal in 11 patients (85%) and supratentorial in 2 patients. Results: In treatment, 10 patients were amenable to grosstotal resection while, 3 underwent subtotal resection. Nine out of 13 patients were given CS radiation therapy (54 Gy primary, 36 Gy spinal), three cranial radiation only, and one primary spinal irradiation. As chemotherapy regimen, except two patients treated with vincristine, procarbazine and prednisolone, other patients were treated according to the POG posterior fossa study (cisplatinum plus etoposide for 3 cycles, cyclofosfamide plus vincristine for 8 cycles). Seven patients were also given intratecal methotrexate weekly for leptomeningeal involvement. Mean duration of followup is 114 months (5312). During this period three patients recurred and died of disease. In survival analysis, 5year EFS rate is 70.5%, and OS rate is %70.5. Conclusions: Grade III ependymomas are difficult group of tumors. Surgery followed by radiation are the standard treatment type. In analysis, resection type or tumor site were not significantly related with prognosis. PO-061 Ependymomas in Children: A Retrospective Analysis of 22 Cases C. Karadeniz 1, A. Okur1, F.G. Pinarli1, A. Borcek2, A. of Medicine, Pediatric Oncology, Ankara, Turkey; 2Gazi University School of Medicine, Pediatric Neurosurgery, Ankara, Turkey; 3Gazi University School of Medicine, Pathology, Ankara, Turkey; 4Gazi University School of Medicine, Radiation Oncology, Ankara, Turkey Background/Objectives: To evaluate the clinical characteristics and longterm outcome of pediatric patients with ependymoma. Design/Methods: A total of 22 patients (13 boys and 9 girls) with newly diagnosed ependymoma between 1993 and 2016 were retrospectively evaluated. An analysis of the demographic, histological and clinical data including the treatment modalities, followup and survival analyses were made. Histopathological examination was evaluated according to World Health Organization (WHO) classification and tumors are classified as lowgrade (WHO Grade III), and highgrade (WHO Grade III) ependymomas. Results: The median age at the time of diagnosis was 8.7 years. The median followup time was 17.5 months (range: 1236 months). The most common site of ependymomas was posterior fossa region (68.2%). Primary tumor localization were spinal cord in 3 patients. There were thirteen and nine patients with WHO Grade II and III histology, respectively. Two patients had evidence of spinal metastatic disease at diagnosis. Treatment consisted of surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Gross total resection and subtotal resection were achieved in 11 (50.0%) and 10 (45.5%) cases, respectively. Radiotherapy was administered to 17 patients and 8 patients received also chemotherapy. The most frequently used regimens were platinumbased. Three patients experienced tumor progression/relapse. Ten patients were alive without disease. Ten year overall and event free survival rates of all patients were %71 and %42, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in overall and evetfree survivals of the patients when compared according to subgroups consisting of grade (II vs III), gross total and less than gross total surgery, and with or without adjuvant chemotherapy (p>0.05). Conclusions: Ependymomas are locally invasive tumors with occasional spinal metastases. Despite multimodality treatment including surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the eventfree survival rates are not satisfactory. The role of the chemotherapy for ependymomas needs to be defined in larger series and clinical trials. PO-062 Pediatric Intracranial Germ Cell Tumors: A Single Institutional Experience C. Khaiman 1, S.L. Laohasurayothin1, Memorial Hospital, Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Department of Pediatrics, Bangkok, Thailand; 2Chulalongkorn University, Department of Pathology Faculty of Medicine, Bangkok, Thailand Background / Objectives: Background: Intracranial germ cell tumors (IGCTs) are considered rare with highly curable neoplasms. The incidence of IGCTs in Eastern Asia is high as compared to western countries. Objectives: To study clinical characteristics and outcomes of children with IGCTs. Design/Methods: A retrospective review in patients diagnosed with IGCTs at Department of Pediatrics, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital from 2007 to 2016. Results: Eighteen patients were diagnosed with IGCTs (11 males and 7 females). Age ranged from 5 to 14 years (median 10.5 years). Presenting symptoms were consisted of hydrocephalus (9 patients), weakness (2 patients), diabetes insipidus (2 patients), visual disturbances (3 patients) and increase intracranial pressure (2 patients). Histopathological diagnosis was germinoma in ten patients (55.6%), yolk sac tumor in 2 patients (11.1%) and mixed germ cells in 5 patients (27.8%). Elevated markers were revealed in approximately 25% of patients. Tumor sites were pineal gland (7 patients), suprasellar (5 patients) thalamic and cerebellar (1 patient each) while the rests were multifocal. Four patients had leptomeningeal involvement. Treatment included total removal in three, partial removal in four while the rest underwent biopsy. Adjuvant chemotherapy was given in all patients. Radiotherapy was given in 16 patients and craniospinal radiation (CSI) was given in leptomeningeal metastasis. With the median follow up of 26 months, five patients experienced relapse, four of them died of disease. Overall survival is 88.9% in germinomatous IGCT and outcomes of leptomeningeal metastasis and nongerminomatous IGCTs are poor. Innovation of therapy should be developed to improve outcomes. PO-063 Evaluation of Acute Toxicities and Treatment Outcomes for Pediatric Medulloblastoma Patients Treated with Craniospinal Irradiation (CSI) T. Mehmood 1 1Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Radiation Oncology, Lahore, Pakistan Background/Objectives: We retrospectively report the acute toxicities and outcomes of pediatric medulloblastoma patients treated with CSI using cranial and spinal posterioranterior photon at our institution. Design/Methods: From September 2011 to August 2013, 19 patients were treated. Standardrisk patients received 23.4 Gy (RBE) CSI and tumor bed boost to 54 Gy (RBE); highrisk (HR) 36Gy (RBE) and 55.8 Gy (RBE), respectively (2 with spine boosts of 5.4Gy (RBE) and 12.6 Gy (RBE)). All patients received concurrent weekly vincristine. 3 HR patients received additional daily carboplatin. Toxicities were documented according to CTCAEv4. Results: Median age was 10.3 years (range 3.717.4). 11 were female, 14 were standardrisk. At baseline, mean neuropsychological abilities across a broad range of performance based measures and parent reported functioning were in the average range (Wechsler IQ Mean=101.86, SD=13.18, Range 76115). Most she had with spine boost, vincristine and carboplatin. G3+ bone marrow toxicity occurred in 4/5 HR patients and all patients receiving carboplatin. Hepatic and renal toxicities were mild. Of 8 patients with available audiograms, at median 11.3 months from end of RT (range 6.626.6), 5 had mildmoderate hearing loss, 3 had none. Of 8 patients for whom detailed postradiotherapy imaging was available, none had radiation necrosis. Followup data were available for 16 patients. At median follow up of 13.8 months (range 3.824.5), 14 are alive without disease, 1 is alive with cerebellar and thecal sac recurrences, and 1 is alive with ventricular recurrence. Conclusions: The CSI technique is safe and welltolerated. The observed GI, bone marrow, hepatic, and renal toxicities depend on chemotherapy regimen. PO-064 ClinicalEpidemiological Characteristics of Central Nervous System Germ Cell Tumors in Children and Adolescents at the Edgardo Rebagliati Martins National Hospital During the E. Guzman1 1Rebagliati Hospital, Peru Background/Objectives: Brain germinal tumors are infrequents but good prognosis by multimodal treatment. Design/Methods: Descriptive, retrospective study of brain germinal tumor under 18 years. Results: Population of 3,263 cases oncologics, 447 patients with brain tumors where nine were brain germ cell tumors during the last 18 years. Mean age 8.2 years, five boys and four girls, male:female sex ratio 1:2. Race: indian one bifocal infrasellar. Twothirds had diabetes insipidus requiring vasopressin, 44.4% had hormone deficiencies requiring corticosteroids and thyroid hormone, one t presented low growth hormone. At diagnosis, five patients underwent radical subtotal resection (55.5%), three patients underwent a biopsy only and one patient underwent a gross total resection. Histopathology: germinoma in seven patients (77.7%) and non germinomatous in two cases (both immature teratomas); no patients demonstrated chromosomal deletions or translocations. Serum alphafetoprotein was elevated in one of seven cases of germinomas and elevated HCG in the two cases of immature teratoma. The first case was an eight years old boy diagnosed in 1998 who received radiotherapy alone after surgery and relapsedeath six months later. Since 1999, chemotherapy has been administered complementary to surgery and radiotherapy with four courses of carboplatinetoposide, alternated with ifosfamideetoposide. At the time of this report, seven patients (77.7%) are alive and in remission of disease, with an overall survival of 730 months and a median survival of 81.1 months Conclusions: Germinal tumors of the CNS are uncommon in Peru as opposed to germinal gonadal tumors. Brain germinal tumors are more frequent in boys, with the suprasellar localization and the germinoma subtype being the most frequent. Chemotherapy complementary to surgery and radiotherapy demonstrates a good response and avoids the need for a second surgery with high survival PO-065 Ectopic Meningioma of the Frontal Bone in a 14YearsOld Boy Followed by a Frontal Subdural Meningioma Case Report K. Zakrzewski Liberski3, M. Neurosuregry, \u00f3d, Poland; 2The Children's Memorial Health Institute, Department of Pathology, Warsaw, Poland; 3Medical University of \u00f3d, Department of Molecular Pathology and Neuropathology, \u00f3d, Poland Background/Objectives: Intracranial meningiomas are relatively rare tumors in children accounting for less than 5% of all primary brain tumors, part of them affecting patients with geneticallydependent phakomatoses or children post CNS irradiation. Ectopic meningiomas of the skull bone are extremely rare entity in a pediatric population. Design/Methods: We describe here the case of a 14yearsold boy presented with a 6months history of a slowgrowing solid mass of the right frontal bone. CT examination revealed tumor, 60 x 80 mm in diameter, located within the right frontal bone with destruction of its normal layers and visibly marked spiculated periosteal reaction. MRI examination confirmed right frontal bone tumor, 72 x 70 x 19 mm in diameter, slightly compressing adjacent brain structures. After contrast administration there was a small homogenous enhancement of the tumor with marked fragmentary enhancement of adjacent dura suggesting possible infiltration. No other intracranial abnormalities were noted. Results: The bone tumor was resected totally with subsequent cranioplasty, no infiltration of the dura was observed. In histological examination transitional meningioma (WHO grade I) was diagnosed. In the series of following MRI examinations slowly growing subdural, extracerebral mass in the same region was noted, One year after the iniltial surgery, the patient was operated on again. Subdural meningioma attached to the inner wall of the dura, was resected with the subsequent duraplasty. Histological examination revealed transitional meningioma (WHO grade I) identical as tumors located within the bone. Twoyears postoperative followup was uneventful, with no tumor recurrence on MRI examinations. Conclusions: Ectopic meningioma of childhood may present as a separate tumor of the skull, without macroscopically visible crossing and destroying the dura. However it may be followed by a second, subdural extracereballar tumor of the same histological pattern. Treatment and Care Surgery (IPSO) PO-066 Sacrococcygeal Tumors in Patients with and without Anorectal Malformations: A Single Institution Comparative Study C. Reck1, A. Vilanova Sanchez 1, T. Reconstruction, Columbus, USA; 2Nationwide Marrow Transplantation, Columbus, USA; 3Nationwide Children's Hospital The Ohio State University College of Medicine, Pediatric Surgery Center for Colorectal and Pelvic Reconstruction, Columbus, USA; 4Nationwide Children's Hospital The Ohio State University College of Medicine, Pediatric Surgery, Columbus, USA Background/Objectives: Despite variability at presentation, sacrococcygeal tumors (SCT) in patients with and without anorectal malformations (ARM) appear histologically similar. The purpose of this study was to identify differences in oncologic outcomes between these two groups. Design/Methods: A retrospective review was performed utilizing our institutional cancer database and colorectal/pelvic reconstruction database for patients with sacrococcygeal or presacral masses between 19902017. Data captured included age at surgical resection, Altman classification, histopathology, recurrence, and followup. Results: Fortyfive patients comprised our cohort, 12 had ARM. Median age at resection was older with ARM (15 months; range 2 days to 17.7 years) than without ARM (<1 month; range 1 day to 6.9 years) (p=0.05). All patients with ARM had Altman type 4 tumors, and histopathology included mature teratoma (8), yolk sac tumor (1), lipoma (1), and unknown (2). Altman classification for patients without ARM included type 1 (9), type 2 (9), type 3 (1), type 4 (7), and unknown (7). Histopathology for patients with SCT without ARM included mature teratoma (20), immature teratoma (7), malignant teratoma/germ cell tumor (4), ganglioneuroma (1), and unknown (1). Altman classification was statistically different between the groups (p<0.0001). There were 7 recurrences, 3 with ARM (25%) at a median time of 3.6 years, and 4 without ARM (12%) at a median time of 1.8 years. Recurrences were not statistically different between the two groups (p=0.36). Three of the recurrences were due to failure of coccyx resection (2 in the ARM group). 5 year event free survival was 64.3% (95% CI: 15.1% in the noARM masses in patients with ARM are resected at a later age, are more likely to have higher Altman classification, and have a high rate of recurrence without complete removal of coccyx at initial operation. PO-067 Caval Replacement in Pediatric Surgical Oncology: Evidences from 3 Cases C. Grimaldi 1, A. Bertocchini1, A. Crocoli1, retroperitoneal tumors is a rare complication in pediatric malignancies. Data about extensive tumor resections with simultaneous caval replacement in adults are scant. Furthermore, only few reports exist on in the pediatric population. In adults, indications to this challenging surgery are mainly oncological (absent or inadequate response to chemotherapy) or clinical (treatment of symptoms of caval obstruction: renal failure, lower limb edema). In children, this procedure is still considered a salvage treatment without clearly extablished indications. Design/Methods: Data were retrospectively collected from our Institution Cancer Data Base from January 2009 to February 2017. Results: Three patients (2 adrenal neuroblastomas, 1 renal cell carcinoma) underwent tumor resection and inferior vena cava (IVC) replacement. One patient with neuroblastoma underwent a auto transplantation of the kidney. One patient is alive a disease free 37 months after surgery. Two patients died of recurrence of the disease 26 and 21 months after surgery, respectively. In one patient the conduit is patent at follow up (37 months), while in 2 patients thrombosis of the conduit was demonstrated at short term after surgery, at 30 and 45 days respectively. In none of those patients signs of caval obstruction after thrombosis of the conduit were experienced. In all patients the anastomosed renal veins were patent at last follow up. Conclusions: This is a small but interesting series, however it's limited to pediatric patients and has a long followup. Major vascular reconstructions are possible with experienced surgeons tailoring reconstructive techniques to the anatomy and extension of the lesions with low mobility and good longterm function. PO-068 Systemic Response Evaluated by Curie Score is not Correlated to the Complexity and Outcome of Primary Tumor Resection in HighRisk Neuroblastoma T. Hishiki 1, M. Kitamura4, K. Matsumoto3 1National Center for Child Health and Development, Surgical Oncology, Tokyo, Japan; 2National Center for Child Health and Development, Pediatric Surgery, Tokyo, Japan; 3National Center for Child Health and Development, Children's Cancer Center, Tokyo, Japan; 4National Center for Child Health and Development, Radiology, Tokyo, Japan Background/Objectives: The role of surgical resection in the treatment of highrisk neuroblastoma has been a matter of debate. Some postulated the advantage of aggressive surgery, indicating that complete tumor resection leads to a better prognosis. However, this is questioned with the speculation that tumors responding better to chemotherapy are likely to be removed easily compared to chemoresistant tumors. We conducted a retrospective review of our institutional experience to eliminate the correlation between response to induction chemotherapy and surgical resectability Design/Methods: Medical records of 27 patients with metastatic neuroblastoma who underwent definitive surgery at our institute from 2002 to 2014 were reviewed. Systemic response to induction chemotherapy was evaluated using the Curie score (CS), a 123IMIBG scintigraphybased quantitative parameter for metastatic diseases. Surgical outcome of cases with one or more CS at the end of induction chemotherapy were compared to those whose CS were eradicated. Results: Twentythree cases had tumors of abdominal origin and four had mediastinal tumors. We used IDRF, which is a measure to predict safe resection of low and intermediate risk neuroblastoma, to evaluate the predicted complexity of definitive surgery. Clearance of IDRF by induction chemotherapy did not correlate to the clearance of CS. As a result of surgery, >90% resection was obtained in 22 cases, while five cases resulted in <90% resection. There were no statistical correlation between CS and extent of resection. The presence of CS was a significant predictor of lower overall survival, whereas the extent of surgery did not affect the overall and eventfree survival. Conclusions: Our study suggests that a good response to induction chemotherapy evaluated by Curie score does not guarantee an easier, complete resection of the primary tumor. There are tumors that are easy to remove in poor responders, and vice versa. Precise evaluation using a larger cohort is warranted to verify this finding. PO-069 Analysis of Surgery for Pediatric Solid Tumors after Centralization of Care in the Netherlands M. Jans 1, S. Terwisscha van Scheltinga1, C. van de G. Tytgat3, M. Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands Background/Objectives: Since 2015 all surgical care for pediatric solid tumors in The Netherlands has been centralized at the Princess M\u00e1xima Center for Pediatric Oncology in Utrecht. The aim of this study is to evaluate surgical complications and mortality for both neuroblastoma (NBL) and Wilms tumors (WT) since the start of centralization. Design/Methods: A prospective observational cohort study was conducted including all children diagnosed and treated for either neuroblastoma or WT between 20152017 at the Princess M\u00e1xima Center. Surgery related complications and mortality were documented. Outcome was compared with our precentralization cohort of pediatric solid tumors between 19982014. Results: [1] Primary tumor resection for NBL was performed in 33 children. Peroperative complication rate was 27% (vs. 42%). was 42% (vs. 43%). Postoperative PICU support due to complications was necessary for 3% (vs. 5%). Secondary surgery for complications was performed in 6% (vs. 8%). No surgery related mortality occurred (vs. 2%). [2] Surgery for WT was performed in 61 children. Peroperative complication rate was 6% (vs. 4%). No tumor rupture occured (vs. 2%). Shortterm complication rate was 26% (vs. 19%). No postoperative PICU support for surgical complications was necessary (vs. 2%). Secondary surgery for complications was performed in 8% (vs. 6%). No surgery related mortality occurred (vs. 0%). Conclusions: A series of surgery related complications and mortality in children treated for neuroblastoma and Wilms tumors since the start of centralized pediatric oncological care in The Netherlands is analyzed. Peroperative complication rate for neuroblastoma has clearly improved since the start of centralized care. Percentage of surgery related adverse events for Wilms tumors is similar. PO-070 Our Experience with Staged Nephron Sparing Surgery in Synchronous Bilateral Wilms Tumour Z. Jenovari Z. Karady2, E. Varga2, M. Csoka2, T. Budi2 1Semmelweis University, 2nd. Department of Pediatrics, Budapest, Hungary; 2Semmelweis University, 2nd Department of Pediatrics, Budapest, Hungary Background/Objectives: In bilateral Wilms tumour the primer nephrectomy on the more affected side and nephron sparing surgery on the other side was accepted method, but follow up studies proved the worsening of kidney function. There are no evidences yet regarding the optimal way to preserve the maximal renal tissue and to provide sufficient oncological treatment. Design/Methods: We retrospectively analysed the data of patients treated in our unit with synchronous bilateral Wilms tumour in the last 10 years. Results: 5 patients were found; all were infants at the first admission (av. 5 month). Male/female ratio: 1/4. None had pulmonary metastasis, or lymph node enlargement. 2 patients underwent primer surgery, the first patient bilateral enucleation, the other unilateral nephrectomy. After chemotherapy both patient underwent further operation, the first patient unilateral nephrectomy; the other wedge resection of the contralateral tumour. Both patients had postoperative chemotherapy, and both have worsening kidney function on the follow up. 3 patients underwent staged nephronsparing surgery started on the less affected side after preoperative chemotherapy. The timing of the operation was determined by regular MRI or US. None of these patients underwent biopsy. The histology (taken at the operation) was favorable in 2, unfavorable in one case. The 2nd stage contralateral nephronsparing surgery attempted after further chemo cycles, the timing was determined by radiology, and also followed by chemotherapy. None of the patients got radiotherapy. All but one patient is tumour free, all has both side significant renal tissue, and all has normal kidney function. One tumour recurrence occurred; nephronsparing surgery was done. The mean follow up is 4 years (8 months8 years) Conclusions: The preoperative chemotherapy may decrease the rate of nephrectomy. The staged nephron sparing surgery carried out after preoperative chemotherapy, with interval and postoperative chemotherapy seems safe and effective way to preserve the maximal amount of renal tissue. PO-071 Outcome of Bilateral Wilms Tumor: Experience from a Single Tertiary Care Centre from India B. Jindal 1, K. Sambandan1, K.K. Govindaranjan1, Background/Objectives: Approximately 57% of children with Wilms tumor present with bilateral disease. Bilateral WT are usually associated with the presence of nephrogenic rests, congenital malformations and predisposing syndromes. The major challenge in bilateral disease is to achieve a cure and at the same time to preserve sufficient functional renal tissue for normal growth and development. Renal failure is major contributor (12%) of morbidity and mortality. We planned to review the cases of bilateral WT treated at our institute, and factors contributing to their morbidity and mortality. Design/Methods: Retrospective review of case records of bilateral WT treated at our hospital, from year 2009 to 2016 and their outcome. Results: Total of 6 cases of bilateral WT were operated over the last 7 years. Of these six cases. Five were synchronous and one had metachronous bilateral WT; two had syndromic association, one each with Denysh Drash Syndrome and WAGR syndrome, of which one had additional associated horse shoe kidney anomaly. Two underwent sequential partial nephrectomy for synchronous bilateral WT, two had simultaneous nephrectomy and tumorectomy, and one with horse shoe kidney with bilateral WT underwent left nephrectomy and partial nephrectomy on other side. Of these six patients, three expired, two lost to follow up and only one is doing well at 2.5 year follow up. Conclusions: Renal failure is a major contributor of morbidity/mortality in bilateral WT and the incidence is high in developing countries due to late presentation. The associated glomerulopathy with Denysh Drash syndrome and WAGR syndrome in which condition the incidence of renal failure increases to 50% and 90% respectively. Nephron sparing surgery (NSS) should be the aim to prevent renal insufficiency, rather than achieving a negative surgical margin which can be dealt with radiotherapy. Sequential nephrectomy or simultaneous NSS still a debatable point which cannot be conferred from this small study. PO-072 Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters by Pediatric Surgeons for Children with Cancer: Initial Experience from a Developing Country W.E. F.F. Gon\u00e7alves1, V. Kremer1, Surgery Department, Barretos, Brazil Background/Objectives: A longterm venous access is essential in children when treating malignant diseases. Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) have been shown to be a valuable alternative to traditional devices providing central access for this patients. PICCs have been used for many years in developed countries, but there are few studies focused on pediatric oncology patients in developing countries. The purpose of this study was to evaluate our initial experience with PICCs specially with regard to feasibility, catheter life, complications and reason for removal in children with cancer in a developing country pediatric hospital. Design/Methods: A retrospective analysis of all pediatric oncology patients who underwent PICC line insertion by the pediatric surgery team at our institution from March 2016 to March 2017 were enrolled in the study. Demographic features, primary diagnosis, catheter days, reason for removal and complications were reviewed. Results: Fortysix PICCs were inserted into 40 children during the 12month period. Median catheter life was 40 days, ranging from 2 to 287 days, with a total of 3046 catheter days. Complication rate of 6.23 per catheter days was recorded. The common reasons for catheter removal were suspected infection, occlusion, dislodgement, and breakage with rates of 3.28, 2.29, 0.98, and 0.32 per 1,000 catheter days, respectively. When compared to solid tumors, hematological malignancies had a higher median catheter permanence (46 vs. 35 catheterdays), and Lymphomas showed the highest median with 84 catheterdays. Conclusions: PICC lines are feasible and provides reliable longterm intranegativenous access in children suffering from malignancies. Although better care and proper dressings are important to minimize premature removals and suspected infection. Education for both parents and nursing team and guidelines are needed to improve complication rates. PO-073 Tumour Biopsies Reaching the Core J. Burns 1, D. Wanaguru1, I. NicklausWollenteit2, S. McGuirk3, D. Hobin4, United Kingdom; 2Birmingham of Histopathology, United Kingdom; Department of Interventional Radiology, Birmingham, United Kingdom; 4Birmingham Children's Hospital, Department of Medical Oncology, Birmingham, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: Percutaneous renal tumour biopsies are crucial in planning neoadjuvant chemotherapy and the timing of surgical resection in the UK. The number of cores taken is operator dependant and can result in inadequate tissue for diagnosis or tumour rupture with consequent upstaging. This study attempts to define the minimum number of cores required for diagnosis and to document the incidence of tumour rupture in relation to number of core samples taken. Design/Methods: Biopsy technique was by the ultrasound guided percutaneous method in all cases and using the coaxial technique. This was a retrospective review of prospectively collected data. All percutaneous trucut renal tumour biopsies taken between February 2002 and September 2016 were included in the analysis. Those with inadequate data about the number of cores taken were excluded. Data on demographics, diagnosis, diagnostic adequacy and number of cores were collected. Details of whether immunohistochemistry, genetics and tissue typing had been performed on the biopsy tissue were also collected. Results: Renal units biopsied N=103; M:F 55:48 Diagnosis included Wilms number cores (range) was 4 (110). There were 6 nondiagnostic biopsies which had a median (range) number of cores 3 (16) There was one tumour rupture following a biopsy and this patient had 7 cores taken. The lowest number of core biopsies with 100% diagnostic accuracy was 3 and the lowest number able to give diagnosis, immunohistochemistry and genetics was 1 core. Conclusions: Three good cores are the minimum number required for diagnosis and this should be subjective and operator dependent. One single good core contains enough tissue for diagnosis, immunohistochemistry and genetics. Further investigation for other tumour sites is ongoing. PO-074 Possibilities of Endosurgery in Diagnosis of Tumor Diseases of of Thoracic and Abdominal Localization at Children D. Rybakova 1 1Federal State Budgetary Institution \"Russian Cancer Research Center. NN Blokhin \"of the Ministry of Health of Russia, Children oncology, Moscow, Russia Background/Objectives: Diagnostic endosurgery is successfully approved in adult oncology and there are data on use of this method in children oncology in foreign literature. Design/Methods: to define possibilities of endosurgery in diagnosis of tumor of thoracic and abdominal localization at children Results: From 2007 to 2012 with the diagnostic purpose it is carried out the 160th operation at 153 children, from which 63 laparoscopic and 44 thoracoscopic biopsies. Except diagnostic biopsies it was executed 53 thoracoscopic resections of lungs at 51 children for the purpose of diagnostics of progressing of a disease, confirmation of metastatic defeat or inflammatory process that made 33% of all diagnostic operations. The age of patients varied from 2 months to 19 years. And children about one year there were 9,8%. Duration the thoracoscopic and laparoscopic biopsies made from 20 minutes to 260 minutes, on average 59 minutes. Blood loss during diagnostic operations averaged 78,3 ml. Intraoperative complications are in 5 cases, and postoperative in - 8. After the endosurgery operations at 59,3% of patients special treatment was carried out, 7,4% had a repeated operation, but already in radical volume and in 33,3% were written out on continuation treatment in a residence or in profile establishment.The average time of the beginning of special treatment made 4 days. Conclusions: Advantages of use of endosurgery in children's oncology are: early terms of the beginning of special treatment, small injury, the minimum blood loss, low number of postoperative complications, early activation of the patient and reduction of terms staying in a hospital, good cosmetic effect. Performance the endosurgery of operations at children with malignant tumors it is possible aged from several weeks, thus the oncological principles of performance of surgery aren't broken, and also the age of the child isn't the limiting factor for performance the endosurgery of operations. PO-075 Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) Mimicking as Neuroblastoma LizanoContreras1, Department of Herrera\", Flow Cytometry Service Laboratory of Specialized Studies and Research, San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica Background/Objectives: Neuroblastoma MS has specific characteristics including presence 18 months of age and metastases to liver, skin, or bone marrow. The aim is present a case were a primary immunodeficiency was the etiology for the clinical findings in a child suspected of Neuroblastoma MS (NBMS). Design/Methods: Retrospective analysis of the medical record of a patient admitted in the National Children's Hospital (Costa Rica), which was first examined by the Oncology Service and subsequently diagnosed/treated by the Pediatric Immunology and Rheumatology Department (SIRP). Results: A 4monthsold female, with 2 previous admissions due to bronchiolitis and oxygen dependence, consulted for irritability, fever, and diarrhea. The mother mentioned 15 days of evolution of skin nodules. On physical examination hepatomegaly and subcutaneous nodules were documented. Abdominal ultrasound documented a solid nodule in the right adrenal gland, hepatomegaly with multiple disseminated solid nodular lesions. Upon clinical suspicion of NBMS, biopsy of a subcutaneous nodule and bone marrow aspirate/biopsy were performed. Skin biopsy did not report malignancy but cultured Nocardia farcinica. Bone marrow aspirate reported absence CD4/CD8 lymphocytes, and therefore assessment of the SIRP was requested. Review of previous blood counts showed persistent lymphopenia (<200/l). Patient required hospitalization (Intensive Care Unit) for infections treatment: subcutaneous nodule/tracheobronchial count was with Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) T B NK+. Followup abdominal ultrasound right adrenal gland\u00b4s nodule partially organized with microcalcifications. The patient received a bone marrow transplant from her HLA identical mother, 3 months after diagnosis. Conclusions: The blood count should be assessed for all neonatal/infant masses, to rule out leukopenia (Immunodeficiencies) before thinking about malignancy. Not all the classic features of NBMS should be classified as neoplastic origin without ruling out other pathologies. Treatment and Care New Drugs/Experimental Therapeutics PO-076 Early Evaluation of Precision Medicine Efficiency for Swedish Children and Adolescents with Cancer C. Rinaldo 1, J. Vigholm1, H. Haapa Pediatric oncology, Stockholm, Sweden Background/Objectives: Today approximately 20% of pediatric cancer patients will experience treatment failure and die of disease. Huge efforts from academics and pharmaceutics have resulted in many potential compounds to be clinically tested. ITCC - Innovative Therapies for Childhood Cancer is the umbrella organization for experimental clinical trials in Europe and currently 51 centers participate. AIMS:To enable all Swedish pediatric patients with relapse or refractory cancer to be included into early phase clinical trials of precision medicine against their disease with the long term aims to increase survival rates and quality of life for children and adolescents with cancer. Design/Methods: The innovative clinical trial unit at the Pediatric Oncology unit at Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm was accredited as an ITCC center in January 2016. Two senior consultants and two experienced pediatric oncology research nurses were appointed, all 50% for the time being. The need for additional research nurses and administrative staff is a priority for 2017. Results: The Working Plan is largely defined including designation of the organization structure, requirement of human resources, facilities, financial requirements, and education of the staff. The administrative work of a yearly opening of 3-4 clinical trials with approvals to the competent authorities and ethical board is finalized. 17 first patients have been enrolled in the INFORM study. Financial support has increased with the help of Barncancerfonden, Entrepreneurs of good and others (additional applications are pending). Conclusions: Initiation and management of a Phase I/II clinical trial unit for pediatric cancer patients in Sweden is of utmost significance. To be part of the future development of pediatric cancer treatment will stimulate clinicians and researchers to plan and conduct their own experimental trial questions. The unit is of important educational benefit for young health care staff during their specialization prior to pediatric cancer positions. Treatment and Care Supportive Care PO-077 Venous Thromboembolism in Children with Cancer Y. Aguilar de la Red1, B. Ponce Salas1, C. Mara Fernandez 1, J. Huerta Aragon\u00e9s1, E. Cela de Julian1 1Pediatric Oncohematology Section., Pediatric. Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n General University Hospital, Madrid, Spain Background/Objectives: Cancer may be considered as a hypercoagulable state and therefore, venous thromboembolism is a frequent complication in adulthood. Even though it is also frequent in pediatric oncology patients, risk factors and prophilaxis/treatment are not so well described. Design/Methods: We analysed 12 patients (016 years old) from 20112017, who presented a thrombosis or venous thromboembolism (VTE) during cancer treatment or the follow up. Results: 12 patients were studied, 8 were female (66.6%). Median age at diagnosis of cancer was 7.2 years old (DS 5.02). Median time from cancer diagnosis to VTE was 8.13 months(DS 11.6). Symptoms were only present in 16.7% of them. Underlying malignancies were: 8 solid tumours (66,6%)(Wilms the most acute leukemias(33,3%) 3 lymphoblastic, 1 acute promyelocytic leukemia(APL). The most common risk factor was the presence of a central venous catheter(CVC) (75%)8 patients (41,7% Portacath), hospitalization in 25% 4, surgery in 16% 2, recent treatment with corticosteroids (33%)4, with asparaginase (16 %)2, mechanical ventilation (16%)2. 7 of 10 patients (70%) were non0 blood group. Only 8patients had inherited thrombophilic factors studied, only 2 had any of them. Obesity and sepsis were not risk factors for VTE in our study. 5 patients (41,7%) received specific treatment for the VTE, all of them with enoxaparin at VTE diagnosis. On 3 of them therapy was substituted afterwards by acenocumarol. The duration of therapy in 2 patients(16.7%) was longer than specific malignancy treatment. Regarding results, 6(50%) of the VTE were completely resolved, 1 patient died during APL induction treatment. Conclusions: Children with cancer are at risk to develop secondary VTE. In our small study, most common risk factors described were having a CVC placed, and solid tumour versus haematologic malignancy. There is still much to be learned about risk factors and the need of specific guidelines for treatment and prophylaxis. PO-078 Dietary Management of Chylothorax Secondary to Mediastinal Trust, Department of Liverpool, United Kingdom; 2Alder Hey Children's Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Department of Paediatric Respiratory Medicine, Liverpool, United Kingdom; 3Alder Hey Children's Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Department of Paediatric Haematology, Liverpool, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: We report the case of a teenage patient newly diagnosed with T cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, presenting with chylous pleural effusions secondary to significant mediastinal lymphadenopathy. We describe our experience in the management of the condition, and a review of current literature. Design/Methods: As the patient continued to receive chemotherapy to treat his leukaemia, a conservative medical approach was taken, with intensive dietetic input to institute a minimal fat diet, incorporating an exchange system. The major dietetic challenge was providing sufficient calorie and protein intake, requiring fat free nutritional supplements (e.g. paediasure plus juice) which the patient found unpalatable. Subsequently, supplemental parenteral nutrition was commenced. As his clinical condition improved, fat content of the diet was gradually increased. Parenteral nutrition was stopped and medium chain triglyceride supplements were added, with relaxation of dietary restrictions based on clinical assessment. Results: Eventually, the chylothorax fully resolved both clinically and radiologically, through conservative management alone. The patient struggled significantly with dietary restriction, requiring significant nutritional counselling and adaptation of his diet to aid compliance. Conclusions: There are no best practice guidelines for the management of chylothorax. A single systematic review from 2015 identifies a lack of consensus in management options, with the strongest evidence coming from case reports, which are highly heterogeneous, and lacking in clinical detail. This case report provides greater detail on the crucial role of dietetic support in managing chyle leak, lacking in previous reports. Further research is needed to generate robust clinical guidance. PO-079 The Management of Fever in Children with Cancer in the North of Scotland T. Lawes1, J. Calley 1, L. Adam1, N. Abdelrazig1, H. Aberdeen Department of Paediatric Oncology, Aberdeen, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: Outcomes in children with cancer continue to improve but febrile neutropenia remains a major cause of mortality. Early recognition and treatment particularly rapid antibiotic administration improves outcomes, whilst appropriate deescalation of care can allow safe discharge. Standards of care have been proposed by both the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the Managed Service Network (MSN) for Children & Young People with Cancer in Scotland. Our aim was to audit the management of fever in paediatric oncology patients presenting to the tertiary centre in the North of Scotland and implement a quality improvement (QI) intervention to support care delivery. Design/Methods: A retrospective criterionbased sample of the first 50 episodes of fever retrieved from case notes of paediatric oncology patients treated in the years 20132015 was analysed for performance against key standards in clinical assessment, early intervention, and escalation/deescalation decisions. Results: The management of 52 episodes from 13 patients were analysed of which 28 were febrile neutropenia and 24 febrile nonneutropenia. Within the target time of 60 minutes 89% of patients were assessed by a doctor, 69% of blood cultures were performed and 64% of empirical antibiotics were administered. Those with a paediatric early warning score 2 were seen earlier, and were more likely to receive antibiotics within the target time (100% vs. 55%, P= 0.013). There was 98% adherence to local empirical antibiotic policy. 61% and 93% of patients were deescalated appropriately at 24 and 4896 hours respectively. Conclusions: Clinical assessment and intervention within the first 60 minutes was identified as our key target area for QI. A febrile neutropenia management proforma has been developed. This is being implemented as part of a wider QI project alongside updates to family information, reinforcement of emergency care standards by multidisciplinary team scenariobased training, and implementation of a programme of regular audit. PO-080 Parental Decision Making and Quality of Life in Children with Cancer M.H. and Technology, nursing, Hualien, Taiwan R.O.C.; 2National Taiwan University, nursing, Taipei, Taiwan R.O.C.; 3National Taiwan University, psychology, Taipei, Taiwan R.O.C.; 4Tamkang University, Mathematicis, Taipei, Taiwan R.O.C. Background/Objectives: This study purpose to explore the family's parental treatment decision making and quality of life of having a child diagnosed with cancer in the hospital. Design/Methods: The institutional review board at the hospital approved all study procedures. Research design using a Indepth interviews and focus group discussions approach in was parents of children diagnosed with cancer in the hospital.Using a participant observation study approach for data collection and themes were uncovered from each interview data set and rigorous methods to data analysis. Record the data with the process recording in interview and participant observation. Data analysis by authors and parent. Results: The cancer treatment decisions made by the parents while their hospitalized children are being treated for cancer mainly include choosing the appropriate hospitals and treatment process. There are fourth themes of the quality of life: (1)Physiologically: Their sleep is disturbed due to the treatments of the children; They are more prone to feeling tired or catching a cold.(2) Psychologically: They are concerned about (a) the side effects of the treatments on the children, and (b) the children's emotional changes under the invasive treatments; Feeling guilty when the other children in the family are being neglected; Feeling difficult reconciling the demands of work and caring for the sick children.(3) The changes in everyday lives: The diets are mainly composed of selfgrown food; Timely isolations in the home environments; Living in one's tribe.(4) Using the support system: The mutual support among husbands, wives, siblings, and paramedical staff. Conclusions: It was expected that findings of the study could provide family members and paramedical staff be the positive force supporting the healing of children. PO-081 Correlation Between Neck Circumference and ARM Muscle Area in Children and Adolescents with Malignant Sao Paulo, Brazil Background/Objectives: Malnutrition in children and adolescents with malignant neoplasms may be underestimated in the diagnosis of the disease when considering only the Body Mass Index. Anthropometric measures are able to detect early malnutrition. Neck circumference (NC) is a simple, inexpensive, and easily applicable measure in clinical practice. Arm Muscular Area (AMA) is recognized in the literature as a good indicator of muscle mass depletion. The main objective of this study is to verify if there is a correlation between the measurement of NC AMA. Design/Methods: A crosssectional study that evaluated children and adolescents between 0 and 20 years of age with malignant neoplasms at a Specialized Pediatric Oncology Institute from October 2015 to June 2016. The measurements of NC were evaluated and, for AMA calculation, arm circumference and skinfold triceps, all performed by trained evaluators, following anthropometric techniques standardized by the literature. The chisquare test was performed to verify the association between inadequacy of AMA and the sexes, with significance level p <0.05. The correlation between NC and AMA was performed through the Pearson correlation. Results: Among 647 patients, 42,66% (276) were females. The mean age for females was 8.65 (\u00b1 5.78) and for males was 9.07 (\u00b1 6.08). The correlation between NC and AMA was linear positive and strong (r=0.80), with a higher correlation coefficient for males than for females (r=0.84 vs r=0.74). There was a significant difference between the sexes and inadequacy of AMA (p=0.01). Conclusions: It was concluded that there is a strong correlation between NC and AMA, with a higher outcome for males. In addition, NC is a simple measure, easy to apply and very useful in clinical practice. PO-082 Emplacement of SingleLumen Subcutaneous Port by AngioRadiology Service: Our Experience in the Last Ten Years A. De Lucio 1, M. gonzalez1 1yes, HematologyOncology Department, Sta. Cruz of singlelumen subcutaneous port (SSQP) in pediatric patients is a daily routine. In last years, it has also been used not only in oncologic patients but also in children with chronic diseases with little complications. Design/Methods: Medical records of pediatric patients (15 years of age) who underwent SSQP at our Hospital between 2005 and 2015 by Angioradiology Service. Variables analyzed included gender, age at diseases' diagnostic, disease, time between diagnosis and collocation, absolute neutrophils and platelets count before procedure, vein used and complications in those years. Results: A total of 121 SSQPs placed in 105 patients (65 males and 40 females). Eighty four cases were malignant diseases (80%) and 21 no malignant (20%). Acute lymphoblastic/myeloblastic leukemia and lymphoma were the most common diagnosis (40%). Median age at diagnosis was 5.8 years (1m14.8 years).Time between diagnostic and collocation was 11.2 days in malignant cases (excluding two cerebral tumors and an opsoclonus syndrome). In the other group, it was 12.3 months. Right internal jugular vein was used as the first location in all the cases. Median absolute neutrophil count before procedure was 6147/mm3 (range 0-181,000) while median platelet was 261,384/mm3 (range 9,000835,000). Median weight was 27 Kilogram (range 477.5). A total of 34 patients (32.3%) had some complication: 16 catheter malfunction (81.2% solved with urokinase), 20 local positive blood cultures, 6 with hematoma or skin infection, 2 broken system and 1 hemotorax. During first month, there were 13 patients with any complication (5 within first week, 2 of them during procedure). New SSQP was placed in 13 patients for different causes (56.2% infections, 25% catheter broken/malfunction and 12.5% relapse after years). Conclusions: We conclude that SSQP is useful and safe in all pediatric patients with a low risk of complications. Their early collocation does not carry additional complications in comparison with other Services. PO-083 Assessment of the Use of Parenteral Nutritional in Intensive and Semi Intensive Therapy Units Pediatric Oncology B.C. Elias 1, P. dos Santos Background/Objectives: nutritional (PN) consists in provide the macro and micronutrients directly into the circulatory system for patients who are unable to receive enteral nutritional therapy (ENT). Considering that patients under cancer treatment undergo intensive treatments that compromise nutritional status, PN is an alternative to meet the patient's current needs. The present study had the goal to evaluate the use of PN in intensive care units (ICU) and pediatric oncology special care units (SCU). Design/Methods: Retrospective observational study performed at a pediatric oncology institute, which included patients aged 0 to 18 years old, hospitalized in the ICU and SCU for more than 24 hours using PN. Results: In a sample of 565 hospitalizations, 3,5% of patients had indication of PN. The main clinical diagnoses were tumors of the Central Nervous System (40%) and Osteosarcomas (15%). The main indication for PN was to the diagnosis of Typhlitis (35%). According the Body Mass Index, 60% had malnutrition and 40% eutrophy. Using the Arm Circumference, 30% were below adequate. The fasting time until the beginning of the PN ranged from 2 to 16 days. Hydroelectrolytic disorders, hemodynamic instability and scheduling of exams were the main reasons for prolonged fasting until early onset of PN. Conclusions: In cases where the enteral route is contraindicated, PN may provide better control of complex disease states, but studies analyzing its practice in pediatric oncology patients are scarce, indicating that more studies are needed. PO-084 Use of Apheresis Platelet Concentrates: One Center Experience Z. 1, sanli2, G. Aydogan1, Oncology, Istanbul, Turkey; 2Kanuni Sultan Suleyman Training and Research Hospital , Blood Bank Department, Istanbul, Turkey Background/Objectives: Thrombocytopenia is a commonly encountered problem for patients who are treated with chemotherapeutic agents. These patients are transfused by random donor platelets (RDPs) or apheresis derived platelets (ADPs) for bleeding or prophylaxis Design/Methods: This study is continued between 01 January 2012 and 30 April 2014 to assess indications to use ADPs instead of RDPs, in pediatric hematology and oncology clinic. Patients' data are collected retrospectively from blood bank records and patients' registry of our hospital database. Results: ADPs are reserved for 56 patients whose age between 1 to 16 years old. ALL is the most common patient group (36 patients:64,3 %), followed by the AML (12 patients:21,4 %), Wilms' tumor (3 patients), Glanzmann thrombasthenia (2 patients), nonHodgkin Lymphoma (2 patients), neuroblastoma (1 patient) respectively. ADPs ordered per patient are 1 to 20 (med:6,6\u00b14,1). ADPs are prepared as two bags mostly in form of 4+4 (92,1%), followed by 6+6 (4,5%) and 8+8 no:265 (74,6%) and no:90 (25,4%) for bleeding. No mortality from bleeding is observed during study period. Platelet counts before transfusion were between 100086000/mm3 (med: 26.000/mm\u00b3). 30 complete unit ADPs (8,4%) and 12 one bag ADPS are disposed due to expired date of use. Conclusions: Preparation of ADP from single donor is an expensive procedure. Usage of upcoming expiration dated thrombocyte concentrates must be monitored closely by blood bank. As a result it is understood that our clinic need to revise the indications of thrombocyte concentrates use and need to focus on education about thrombocyte concentrate use. PO-085 Assessing Nurses' Knowledge and Skills on Identification and Management of Cytotoxic Induced Extravasation in Oncology Day Care in a Tertiary Care Hospital Via Clinical Audit A. Feroz 1 1Aga Khan University Hospital, Pakistan Background/Objectives: Incidences of extravasations are being monitored as a key quality indicator in oncology areas, however to work more towards precision, a need for assessment of knowledge and hands on capacity of nurses in identifying and early managing of cytotoxic extravasation was identified. Design/Methods: Clinical Audit was the identified strategy for assessment, with the help of existing best practice institutional guideline, checklist was being developed; piloted on oncology nurses not working in day care oncology, and validity was gained. A clinical audit was performed from 15th July, 2016 to 5th August, 2016, in which initially observation was made on nurses' assessment of 48 cytotoxic administration followup patients. In second phase staffs were being asked to demonstrate management of extravasation in simulated based setting. Results: Around 82% of patients were being assessed for condition of last cannulated site, however only 3% of discoloration of IV sites were identified and being notified to physicians on floor. On hands on management of extravasation only 70% of nurses were able to aspirate residual cytotoxics from skin and 30% were comfortable in injecting hydrocortisone at extravsated site. Conclusions: A strong need for hands on training for extravasation assessment and management is being identified for oncology nurses. Video based and simulated based learning can be taken as a strategy for training of oncology nurses on rare occurring situations like extravasation. PO-086 An Assessment of Central Line Associated Blood Stream Infections (CLABSI) in Southern Vietnam R. Huynh 1, V.S. Nguyen1, C. Assanasen2 1UTHSCSA, Long School of Medicine, San Antonio Texas, USA; 2UTHSCSA, Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, San Antonio Texas, USA Background/Objectives: Though Vietnam has become one of the top 10 fastest growing economies globally, as an LMIC it still needs improvement in pediatric oncology care. Survival rates as low as 5% have been reported in Vietnam in 2008, and although it has risen beyond this point, the rates remain well below that of their Western developed counterparts. This low survival rate has been attributed to differences in chemotherapy treatments as well as inexperience with supportive care preventative measures such as central line associated blood stream infection (CLABSI) monitoring. Design/Methods: Medical directors at three institutions in Ho Chi Minh City Vietnam (City Children's Hospital, Children's Hospital #2, and Children's Hospital #1) were surveyed to determine how central line infections were identified and monitored in their pediatric hematology/oncology patient populations. Questions included whether the director was familiar with the recent ASPIC guidelines for the prevention of CLABSIs, monitoring policies, and current estimates. Education of staff using a trainthetrainer approach was implemented with the development of infrastructure and policies to monitor rates long term. Staff members surveyed also provide insight into gaps in care. Results: Though limited by many resources, two surveyed institutions reported the majority of their pediatric oncology patients used central lines regularly. One hospital had not yet begun caring for pediatric oncology patients. All three, however, did not have current policies or procedures in place for CLABSI monitoring. Estimated infection rates reported varied widely ranging from 1030%. Hospital directors have viewed initial responses to supportive care training positively. Direct observation revealed inconsistencies and unanticipated problems, such as ineffective occlusive dressing adhesive within the humid environment. Conclusions: There are no reports on the CLABSI rates in pediatric cancer hospitals within southern Vietnam. Our report represents the initiation and commitment toward this quality improvement effort. As improvement takes place over time, further details will be provided. PO-087 Hospital Construction or PersontoPerson Transmission is the Source of Pneumocystis Jiroveci Pneumonia Outbreaks in Pediatric Acute Leukemia Department of Pediatrics, Daegu, Republic of Korea Background/Objectives: After the era of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) prophylaxis, PCP is decreasing and rare. However, there are limited reports about transmission and disease courses of PCP in pediatric immunocompromised patients under TMP/SMX prophylaxis. Recently a cluster of PCP was reported in a hospital construction setting, we investigated this study to assess the risk factors of PCP outbreaks. Design/Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of pediatric patients who were diagnosed with hematologic malignancies and solid tumor and received chemotherapy at Kyungpook National University Children's hospital between October 2014 and March 2017. Among the patient diagnosed pneumonia during chemotherapy, medical records of patients who did not respond to empirical antibiotics therapy for community acquired pneumonia or hospital acquired pneumonia were reviewed. Clinical characteristics were reviewed. Results: From October 2014 to March 2017, four patients who received chemotherapy and TMP/SMX prophylaxis were diagnosed as proven or suspected PCP. All cases occurred within 3 months period from August to December 2016 under the hospital construction. The duration of each episode overlapped in time suggesting the possibility of persontoperson transmission. They were on chemotherapy with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, one on consolidation and the other three on maintenance chemotherapy. Three PCP patients during maintenance chemotherapy were clinically improved after TMP/SMX treatment and adjuvant corticosteroid therapy. The PCP patient during consolidation chemotherapy expired due to progressive acute respiratory distress syndrome and pneumothorax while receiving mechanical ventilator support. Two patients showed Pneumocystis carinii PCR positive and the other two patients showed negative results. Conclusions: The cluster of PCP is significant in terms of air borne and persontoperson transmission of pneumocystis in a hospital construction setting. Considering the high morbidity and mortality of PCP, respiratory isolation of suspected patients and construction environmental reservoirs control are also important in addition to accurate diagnosis and early treatment. PO-088 Sibling Support for Children Who have been Treated for a Cancer: A Collaborative Approach N. Kisby 1, N. 1Candlelighters, Support, Leeds, Kingdom; 2Leeds Oncology Outreach Team, Leeds, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: Candlelighters has been providing support for families affected by childhood cancer for over 40 years. As part of this support, specific sibling groups for children affected by childhood cancer have been developed. These groups are supported by wider members of the Multidisciplinary team. The overall aim in undertaking work directly with siblings, is that every brother and sister has the opportunity to receive support within an environment in which they feel safe and comfortable. Siblings are often viewed as the 'forgotten' group and their needs can be overlooked. As siblings try to come to terms with the severity of their brother or sister's illness this may give rise to a number of conflicting emotions. Design/Methods: The Candlelighters groups offer them the time and opportunity to be with other siblings who are in the same situation as themselves. It also gives them the opportunity to be the focus (even for just a few hours) and opportunity just to be themselves. The groups provide the chance to talk with some of the professionals who are directly involved with the care of their families enabling them to ask questions which they may feel uncomfortable asking their families for fear of upsetting them. Most importantly it is about providing a space for the siblings to have time out and to have fun. The groups are held once per month alternating between children going through treatment and bereaved siblings. Three times per year, the groups come together for a trip. The monthly groups are held at Candlelighters (The Square). Results: \"Candlelighters are fun and help me forget stuff going on at home\", \"Candlelighters help people make more friends\" and \"At Candlelighters you can always say your feelings\". Conclusions: As the feedback in our results states the sibling groups provide much needed support for all siblings affected by childhood cancer. PO-089 Breakthrough Disseminated Invasive Fusariosis Fungal Infection in a Patient with Acute Myeloid Leukemia Under Micafungin Prophylaxis, Case Report Y. Alsheshtawi5, L. Shalaby2 1National institute Cairo university EGYPT, pediatric oncology, CAIRO, Egypt; 2Children cancer hospital 57357 EGYPT, Pediatric oncology, Cairo, Egypt; cancer hospital 57357 Egypt, clinical pathology, Cairo, Egypt; 4children cancer hospital 57357 Egypt, clinical microbiology, Cairo, Egypt; 5children cancer hospital 57357 Egypt, clinical research, Cairo, Egypt Background/Objectives: Invasive fusariosis, though rare, may cause disseminated infections in patients with hematological malignancies and in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. The mortality attributable to Fusarium infections in immunocompromised patients ranges from 50% to 70% Design/Methods: We report a case of acute myeloid leukemia, male patient, 7 years old admitted in our hospital (Children Cancer Hospital Egypt 57357). Patient started induction chemotherapy with micafungin prophylaxis from d1 chemotherapy according to our policy. At day 20 induction patient had multiple skin lesion started as erythematous raised papules, indurated and painful with a central area of necrosis as well as target lesions and perforated nasal septum. Patient was shifted to broader spectrum liposomal amphotericin B. Results: Fusarium was isolated from Blood culture, fungal screening was done including CT Chest, sinuses and abdomen showing non specific bilateral pulmonary infiltration and sinusitis. Fundus examination was free. Biopsy taken from skin lesion showed fungal hyphae that are septated with branching and associated with round bulbous ends consistent with fusarium infection. Clinical improvement with healing and ulceration of skin lesion with resolution of pulmonary infiltration after recovery from neutropenia. Bone marrow aspirate done to assess response to treatment showed complete remission. Patient discharged on voriconazole after achieving therapeutic level. Reassessment before 2nd cycle chemotherapy showed clinical and radiological improvement, patient kept on voriconazole as secondary prophylaxis. Conclusions: Fusariosis though rare it should be suspected and covered with appropriate antifungal in presence of suspected cutaneous lesions in immunocompromised patients. Due to the lack of clinical trials and the critical role of immune reconstitution in the outcome of fusariosis, the optimal treatment strategy for patients with severe Fusarium infection remains unclear. Reversal of immunosuppression is recommended whenever possible. PO-090 Enteral Feeding with Gastrostomy in Pediartic a major prognostic factor in pediatric oncology. Enteral feeding by gastrostomy is increasingly used to prevent and treat malnutrition in this population. The main objective of our study is to describe immediate and late complications arising after a gastrostomy placement procedure. Design/Methods: We performed a retrospective monocentric observational study of children treated between 2012 and 2016 in a pediatric oncology center and who benefited from a placement of button gastrostomy during oncological treatment. Results: thirty three patients (17 male, 16 female), mean age 10.3 years, have benefited from a button gastrostomy placement. Fourteen were malnourished at the time of diagnosis (42%), and 27 at the time of gastrostomy insertion (81%), - on average 10.7 months later. Percutaneous radiologic placement was used in 66% of cases. Prophylactic antibiotics were prescribed for 22 patients (66.7%). Enteral feeding started on average 1.7 days after procedure. The mean delay from insertion to removal was 21.3 months. We report 46 side effects (1 arising in the first 15 days and 45 later) consisting in leaks (34.4%), infection requiring general (31.2%) or local (9.4%) antibiotic treatment, vomiting (23.3%), granulation tissue formation (21.2%), bedsore(6.2%), and accidental removal (15.2%). At the time of button removal 33 % of patients were still undernourished. Conclusions: Gastrostomy feeding in chronic pediatric diseases is well described. In pediatric oncology, its benefit is not clearly demonstrated and responsible for numerous late complications which could disturb oncological treatment plan. Some of these complications could be avoided by an earlier nutritional evaluation and support. PO-091 Exploring Nurses' Understanding of ChemotherapyInduced Nausea and Vomiting in Paediatric Cancer Patients: A Quantitative Study E. Neumann 1 1Birmignham Children's Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Haematology/Oncology, Birmingham, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: Background: Chemotherapy remains the firstline treatment for many paediatric cancer conditions but research by Wood et al. (2015) found chemotherapyinduced nausea and vomiting (CINV) to be the most documented distressing sideeffect of childhood cancer treatment. Research among the adult population found cancer nurses' played an integral role in the management of CINV but their knowledge and understanding was lacking. There was no comparable data available within the paediatric field. Aim: To explore and understand nurses' knowledge of CINV and identify future learning needs, ultimately improving patient care through improved knowledge of symptoms by staff. Design/Methods: Method: This quantitative study adapted a previously used questionnaire to explore nurses' understanding of CINV, working in a Principle Treatment Centre (PTC) and three, Level 3 Paediatric Oncology Shared Care Units (POSCU's) within the United Kingdom. A purposive sampling technique was utilised with a paperbased questionnaire targeting the population of all registered nurses working at these four sites (n=143). Results were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics to demonstrate nurses' overall understanding and knowledge of CINV in relation to paediatric cancer. Results: Results Response rate was 51%. An overall knowledge gap existed amongst nurses at all research sites and no significant differences in the knowledge level between PTC and POSCU nurses was observed. Nurses had no awareness of the available assessment tools for CINV. Conclusions: Conclusions Nurses' knowledge on these distressing symptoms needs to be increased in order to improve patient care and experience. The most popular choices for receiving further education were face: face and online modules while selfdirected learning featured as the least popular choice among all participants. There was a significant gap in knowledge regarding available assessment tools, therefore knowledge should be increased on this subject. PO-092 Current Status and Challenges of Support for Pediatric Cancer Patients' Siblings An Analysis of Ward Managers' Free Descriptions J. Nonaka 1, M. Yonayama1, S. Oka1, M. Yamazaki1, M. Uchida2 1kanagawa University of Human Services Faculty of Health & Social Work School of, nursing, Yokosuka, Japan; 2Nagano College of Nursing, Nursing, Nagano, Japan Background/Objectives: A questionnaire survey was conducted on support for the siblings of children with diseases or disabilities, involving ward managers, and their free descriptions were analyzed to clarify the current status and challenges of such support. Design/Methods: subjects:Seventy ward managers supporting the siblings of children hospitalized in pediatrics throughout Japan.Data collection method and procedure: Questionnaires were distributed in envelopes to facilities which previously consented to cooperate with the study. Analytical method: The contents of the collected descriptions were analyzed and grouped based on semantic similarities and differences to create categories. The approval of the research ethics committee of the researchers' facility was previously obtained. Results: Respondents' backgrounds: Among the 70 ward managers of hospitals specializing in pediatrics throughout Japan, 36 of 10 facilities responded. <Examples of inhospital sibling support> supporting endstage pediatric patients' siblings ; supporting siblings not allowed to enter wards> ; supporting discharge to home ; making environmental and temporal arrangements for siblings and families to stay together ; holding events for siblings ; providing explanations to siblings. <Desires, expectations, systems, and organizations related to sibling support in the in and outpatient divisions> making environmental and systematic arrangements for siblings and families to stay together ; organizing systems to take care for siblings ; developing human resources ; and performing nursing care for families. As for the status of sibling support, the respondents noted the following issues: insufficient manpower ; the risk of infection ; individualized approaches ; alternative equipment use. Conclusions: The ward managers made environmental, temporal, and systematic arrangements, such as coordinating visits, and gave considerations with awareness. It was also noted that they carefully considered appropriate methods to support endstage patients' siblings, as such support was difficult, and required sufficient consideration, highlighting the necessity of establishing systems for ward managers to provide sibling and family support. PO-093 Factors Affecting Fatigue in Pediatric Oncology Patients A.M. Platschek V. Abeln1, B. Hero2, T. Simon2, H.K. Str\u00fcder1 1German Sport University Cologne, Institute of Movement and Neurosciences, Cologne, Germany; 2University of Cologne, Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology Children's Hospital, Cologne, Germany Background/Objectives: Cancerrelated fatigue is one of the most frequent and severe symptoms experienced by pediatric oncology patients during treatment. Fatigue is multidimensional, with the most distressing symptoms affecting quality of life. There is uncertainty regarding the predictive power of physical activity prior to disease relative to other factors on fatigue outcome in pediatric cancer patients. Design/Methods: In eleven pediatric cancer patients (6 female; mean age=11.82\u00b12.44 years) PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale questionnaire was completed during cancer therapy. Types of cancer present in this study were leukemia (n=3), lymphoma (n=5), sarcoma (n=2) and neuroblastoma (n=1). The standard treatment for the pediatric patients was adjuvant chemotherapy according to national protocols. Daily activity level before disease was retrospectively interrogated with 24 hours division selfreport (active time, sleeping, sitting, lying awake in bed) at the beginning of treatment. Pearson correlations and Students ttest were used to analyze the data (=0.05). Results: Mean time between start of cancer therapy and fatigue questionnaire was 147.55\u00b164.46 days. Mean activity level before disease was 5.64\u00b12.11 hours per day and ranged between 2.00 and 8.00 hours. Patients with higher activity level before disease show a significant higher fatigue score during cancer therapy (r=0.715, P=0.013), higher scores indicate lower fatigue. However, age (r=0.356, P=0.283) and gender (r=0.584, P=0.059) had a less severe impact on fatigue outcome. Conclusions: Activity status before disease seems to be a more powerful predictor of fatigue among pediatric oncology patients than other factors like gender or age. These findings emphasize the importance of physical activity in lessening side effects in cancer therapy. PO-094 NAcetylcysteine as a Secondary Prophylaxis for Ifosfamide Induced Renal Tubulopathy in Children with Solid Tumors: Case Series M. Rojas Vasquez1, M. Diachinsky 1, (IFO) is a commonly used chemotherapy agent in pediatric solid tumors. A known side effect of IFO is renal tubulopathy (RT). There is limited data suggesting that Nacetylcysteine (NAC) can prevent nephropathy induced by IFO. We aim to report a cohort of children with RT secondary to IFO successfully treated with NAC. Design/Methods: Case series of children with solid tumors between the ages of 0 - 17 years and RT secondary to IFO treated with NAC. Results: Two patients fulfilled the criteria. Patients received NAC intravenously post IFO as follow: 150mg/kg hours 56, 50mg/kg hours 610 and 100mg/Kg hours 1024. Patient one had Relapsed Rhabdomyosarcoma and received IFO 2400 mg/m2/day with Etoposide 100mg/m2/day on days 1,2 and 3 and Carboplatin 635mg/m2 on day 3 that was extended for eight courses. Patient two had Osteosarcoma previously treated with highdose methotrexate, cisplatin and doxorubicin for ten weeks and subsequently required oral replacement with magnesium. She then received two courses of IFO 2800mg/m2/day and Etoposide (100mg/m2/day) for five days. Both patients received pre, posthydration and Mesna as per institutional guidelines. Patient one developed RT after course 5 and patient two after course 1. Both had significant hypophosphatemia, hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, hyponatremia and acidosis requiring intravenous replacement of sodium chloride, potassium phosphate and magnesium followed by two weeks of oral replacement. Patient one received NAC on courses 6, 7 and 8 and patient two on course 2. After first course of NAC, both patients developed mild hypophosphatemia, hypomagnesemia and acidosis with other electrolytes normal requiring few days of oral potassium, phosphate and magnesium. Patient one did not required electrolytes replacement after courses 7 and 8. Conclusions: We report two patients with solid tumors with RT secondary to IFO who responded to treatment with NAC when given concomitantly with IFO. Prospective studies are required to further confirm this therapeutic approach PO-095 Intestinal Mucor Infection in a Patient with NonHodgkin's Lymphoma During Induction Chemotherapy A. Erbay1, 1, S. Of Pediatric OncologyHematology, Department Of Pediatric Surgery, Department Of Pathology, Adana, Turkey Background/Objectives: Intestinal mucor mycosis is a very rare and frequently a fatal condition in immunocompromised patients. Design/Methods: An 8 yearold male was diagnosed as stage III NHL in another hospital. Before admission to our center, after first course of chemotherapy he had experienced a tumor lysis and posterior reversible ensefalopathy syndrome (PRESS). We detected a low creatinin clearence, panhypogammaglobulinemia, B type lymphopenia and partial response of lymphoma. Immunosupression type could not be adressed if it was primary or secondary. Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) was administered and B block of BFM regimen was started. Febrile neutropenia was occured early. Meropenem, teicoplanin and fluconazol were given as emprical treatment. Amikacin was added for resistant fever. In 5th day of antibiotics, he had abdominal cramps and vomiting. There were fluid levels in plain Xray. Nasogastric decompression, metronidazol and caspofungin were started. After 3 days of conservative management for cytological improvement, laparotomy was made. In jejunal and ileal segments were necrosis and perforations. Ileostomy and segmentary jejunal resection were made. After 2 days, a second surgery was made with resection of ileum with necrosis. Specimen showed mucor mycosis. Liposomal amfoterisin B was started. Results: After the completion of treatment for febrile neutropenia, a course of vinkristin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide and etoposide was given. A third surgery was done for abcess after 40 days of the second surgery. Mucor mycosis was again displayed in specimen.Amphotericin B was continued for 125 days. We switched to posaconazole because of kidney functions. Chemotherapy could not be continued due to fungal infection and nephrotoxicity. Weekly rituximab was adminestered for 4 courses. The patient is still under followup with in remission for 14 months for primary disease. Conclusions: This patient was presented because of rare and highly lethal fungal infection during induction treatment of Burkitt's lymphoma. He was treated with surgical resections and antifungal treatment. Treatment and Care Palliative Care PO-096 Palliative Care for Children Case Study at Taso Uganda S. Nandaula 1 1Uganda Cancer Institute, Palliative care and research, Kampala, Uganda Background/Objectives: Many people live and die of pain in Uganda. A study was done to describe family, and leaders from different communities on the impact of each community based service delivery and interventions. The major objective was to see that all childern are cared for with diginity especially when diagnosed with a terminal illness Design/Methods: Different modules were used in Uganda and there after rapid evaluation fields techniques in each community was done, getting data from three sources: observations of clinical and the encounters, interviews with informants and the local healthy leaders not forgetting data collections and statistics Results: We interviewed 33patients with a terminal illness, 27 caregivers, 36staff, 25client representatives and 29community leaders. In each site, Antivirals were used effectively. Children valued being treated with dignity and respect without discrimination. Being supported at home reduced physical, emotional and financial burden of traveling to and care at health facilities. Practical support and instruction in feeding and bathing patients facilitated a good death at home with all the information given. In each community mobile phones enabled access to clinical and social support work Client representatives and community leaders reported that caring for the HIV/AIDS children especially in poor communities was stressful, but also rewarding, with resilience forced by having good treatment therapies. Conclusions: This programme was new and it was reported to be successful because they integrated symptom control with practical physical care, education and spiritual care for these children. Holistic pediatric palliative care can be delivered effectively in the face of community leaders and integrated in public health approach. Treatment and Care Psychosocial (PPO) PO-097 Breaking the Barrier of Childhood Cancer Treatment Abandonment: The Case of Ghana A. Sarpong 1 1Korle Bu Teaching Hospital, Department of Child Health, Accra, Ghana Background/Objectives: High Treatment abandonment rates is a major contributor to treatment failure in developing countries. In 2010, 62% of children receiving treatment for cancer abandoned treatment in Ghana. In the same year, an International Twinning project commenced. There has been a continuous decline in the number of children that interrupted treatment between 2010 and 2016. This paper assesses the factors motivating parents to continue with treatment, despite daunting constraints; and the contributions of the Twinning Project towards the progress made. Design/Methods: Key project activities include training (workshops and internships), treatment sponsorship, psychosocial support and setting up of data registers. Analysis of data from two facilitybased registers established a consistent decline in treatment abandonment from 2010 to 2016. With the aid of questionnaire, 42% of the parents were randomly selected and interviewed facetoface, between January and December 2016. STATA (version 12) was used for the data analysis and descriptive statistics employed for the results presentation. Results: A total of 285 children were presented for cancer treatment at the two centres in 2016. Participants in the study were 120 parents (80% females, 20% males). Majority (31%) said treatment sponsorship was the key enabling condition helping them continue with treatment. Psychosocial support (peer counselling18% and nurseguardian counselling17%) were the most important factors that urged parents on. Other factors of motivation were financial support from extended family and other sources (8%), believe in God(7%), and love for the child(6%). Conclusions: Psychosocial support and treatment sponsorship combined were cited by twothirds (66%) of respondents as most important factors contributing to the lowering of treatment abandonment rates. International Twinning partnership with activities that include training, psychosocial support and treatment sponsorship hold the potential to lowering treatment abandonment rates in developing countries. Advocacy for sustainable treatment funding by governments is important if treatment abandonment could be eliminated in developing countries. PO-098 Setting An Agenda for Advocacy, Research, and Care of Siblings of Children with Cancer M. Alderfer 1, M. Goldish on behalf of SPARCCC & Summit participants2 1Alfred I duPont Hospital for Children, Center for Healthcare Delivery Science, Wilmington, USA; 2Sibling Partnership for Advocacy Research and Care in Childhood Cancer, USA Background/Objectives: The purpose of this presentation is to describe the process and outcome of the Sibling Research Summit, a 1.5 day invitationonly gathering of researchers, clinicians, advocates, communitypartners and siblings of children with cancer focused upon setting an agenda for advocacy, research, and care of siblings of children with cancer. Design/Methods: In November 2016, the Sibling Partnership for Advocacy, Research and Care in Childhood Cancer (SPARCCC) hosted a Sibling Research Summit in Philadelphia, with financial support from Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation (ALSF). After introductory remarks from members of SPARCCC and ALSF, the panel of adolescent and young adult siblings told their stories of how cancer impacted them and their families. The researchers, clinicians, and advocates then introduced themselves and their work. Recent systematic reviews of the sibling literature were presented and the group set out to identify priorities for moving advocacy, research and care of siblings of children with cancer forward. Results: Four priority areas were identified and discussed: 1) Identifying and measuring the \"ultimate costs\" of childhood cancer on siblings (i.e., psychosocial development, achievement, financial); 2) Screening siblings of children with cancer for unmet needs and adjustment difficulties and providing appropriate levels of care (e.g., education, monitoring, intervention); 3) Developing evidencebased interventions and empirically evaluating new and existing communitybased interventions for siblings (e.g., oncology camps, SuperSibs); and, 4) Advancing education and awareness within families, communities (e.g., schools) and the healthcare system regarding psychosocial issues faced by siblings in families of children with cancer and influencing healthcare policy (i.e., including siblings in familycentered care). Conclusions: Progress is being made in understanding and addressing the psychosocial needs of siblings of children with cancer, however, coordinated international collaborations of key stakeholders are needed to propel these efforts forward. We acknowledge the generous support of ALSF and CIGNA and wholeheartedly thank all Sibling Research Summit participants. PO-099 Exploring Family and Staff Educational Needs at Major Referral Pediatric Oncology Hospitals: A Qualitative Study in EL Salvador, Guatemala and Mexico E. Atwood 1, F. Antillon2, S. Fuentes Alabi3, L. VegaVega4, I. Albanti5 1Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Global Health & Population, Boston, USA; 2Unidad Nacional de Oncologia Pediatrica, Pediatric Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Global Health Institute, Boston, USA Background/Objectives: Best practices for identifying and matching the informational needs of parents at the time of their child's diagnosis with cancer are currently unknown, and research in low and middleincome countries is even more limited. There is also little guidance about how to deliver information to parents and in what setting. Aspects to consider when developing the information include the socioeconomic level of parents, cultural or language barriers, and the availability of qualified personnel or resources to create educational materials. This study assessed how families receive information and explored further needs regarding the most important topics and the desired method of communication. Design/Methods: A qualitative study was designed and over 50 inperson interviews were conducted in English and Spanish using a structured guide. Key informants included parents, physicians, nurses, psychosocial staff, administrative and foundation leadership, volunteers, communication and government professionals. The study sites included Unidad Oncolog\u00eda Pedi\u00e1trica in Guatemala, Benjamin Bloom Hospital in El Salvador, and Hospital Infantil Telet\u00f3n de Oncolog\u00eda in Mexico. NVivo was used for thematic analysis. Results: Across all sites, the most common questions were: Why my child? What is cancer? How do I discuss this with my other children? The educational needs included explaining the origin of cancer and addressing perceptions of guilt and myths about cancer, how to care for the child at home and adherence to treatment. The preferred communication medium was an audiovisual tool such as a video, with internet and radio as secondary options. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that educational needs of parents differ despite geographic proximity and shared language. Developing an educational program in resourcelimited settings can be challenging, but it is crucial to maintain family participation. This study can be used as a guide for other programs wanting to develop educational materials. Further research could evaluate the effectiveness of the information in educating parents. PO-100 The Effect of Sexual Health on Body Image and Self Esteem Among Adolescents and Young Adults with Cancer Y. BenGal 1 1Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel, Pediatric Hematologyoncology, PetachTikva, Israel Background/Objectives: During adolescence hormonal, physical and mental changes occur. These changes effect body image, self esteem and sexual health,and are more complex in teenager cancer patients. The disease and therapies, effect negatively on their body image and self esteem. Objectives identify the variables affecting self esteem, body image and sexuality among teenagers cancer patients Design/Methods: During 4 years, data was collected via interviews with 26 adolescent cancer patients that treated in the Department of Pediatric Hematology Oncology of SCMCI. Results: Fourteen adolescent boys and 12 girls participated. Average age was 16.46 years, Female adolescent possessed a lower selfimage and body image than their male counterparts (p < 0.0025). A decrease was found in body image among male adolescents who underwent fertility preservation procedure, (3.1) compared to those who had not (3.6) (p < 0.001). Female teenagers with GnRH antagonist treatment reported a significantly higher selfimage and body image compared to those not treated (p < 0.014). Adolescents who engaged in their sexuality prior to their illness experienced a decrease in selfimage and body image. Pearson test showed positive correlation (0.67) (p < 0.00) between body image and selfimage, and negative correlation (0.57) (p < 0.001) between body image and side effects. Regression analysis of demographic data and sexually related variants found higher satisfaction with body image (p < 0.00), intimate behavior prior to illness (p < 0.001) and parental marital status (married) are predictive of higher selfesteem during treatment. Conclusions: Selfesteem and body image are negatively affected by sideeffects of cancer treatment. As the perception of the side effects by the teenagers is greater, there is a decrease in bodyimage and selfesteem. There is a need for a comprehensive preparation prior to fertility preservation procedures and medical treatment with explanations and emotional support for adolescents. Preparing such an intervention, further study on the effect of fertility preserving procedures on bodyimage and selfesteem are needed. PO-101 Health Related Quality of Life During Treatment in Adolescents Aged 1218 Years with Cancer M. BultMulder 1, S. Sasja1,2,3, K. Van Bindsbergen1, Children's AMC, Pediatric Oncology, Amsterdam, Psychology, Memphis, USA; 4Amalia Children's Hospital Radboud University Medical Center, Medical Psychology, Nijmegen, The Netherlands; 5VU Medical Center, Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Amsterdam, The Netherlands Background/Objectives: A cancer diagnosis influences health related quality of life (HRQOL). The objectives for this study are: 1) to describe the HRQOL of adolescents aged 1218 years in active treatment for cancer and compare them to their healthy peers, 2 ) to get insight in the oncology specific HRQOL during treatment. Design/Methods: HRQOL was measured using the PedsQL (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory) 4.0. Mean scale scores were compared between adolescents with cancer (N=73, Mage=14.71, SD=1.85) and a healthy reference group MANOVA analysis. To measure Cancerspecific HRQOL, the PedsQL Cancer Module 3.0 was used. Scores were dichotomized as absence of problems ('neveralmost never') and prevalence of problems ('sometimes often, almost often). Percentages were calculated to determine the proportion of adolescents reporting problems on the PedsQL Cancer module 3.0. Results: Adolescents under active cancer treatment reported significantly lower physical ps<.05, effect sizes were small to large (2= .10 to .44). Prevalence of cancer specific HRQOL problems was highest for items on pain (hurt in joint or muscle, 42.9%), nausea (nausea during treatment 47.1%, food doesn't taste good 54.3%, nausea when smelling food 61.4%), worry (about relapse 45.7%, about side effects 52,9%), cognitive (problems paying attention 47.1%) and physical appearance (not looking good 47.1%) domains. Conclusions: Lower HRQOL and Cancer specific problems are experienced on both physical and psychosocial domains. Monitoring of HRQOL is of utmost importance to adequately support adolescents. Interventions should focus on physical aspects of relieving pain and nausea but also on information about treatment to decrease worrying, help with schoolwork and support for dealing with body image. PO-102 Preliminary Feasibility and Acceptability of Light Therapy to Increase Energy in Adolescents and Young Adults Newly Diagnosed with Solid Tumors V. Crabtree 1, H. Zhang2, J. Brigden1, L.A. Christy1, M. Wilson3, A. Pappo4 1St Children's Research Hospital, Psychology, Memphis, 2St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Biostatistics, Memphis, USA; Health Science Center, Ophthalmology, Memphis, USA; 4St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Oncology, Memphis, USA Background/Objectives: Fatigue is one of the most consistent, distressing symptoms reported by pediatric oncology patients. Bright white light has been shown to prevent increases in fatigue in adult breast cancer patients and reduce fatigue in adult cancer survivors. However, no definitive intervention to reduce fatigue has been developed for pediatric oncology patients. The current study was designed to estimate the feasibility and acceptability of bright white light as an intervention to decrease fatigue in adolescents/young adults (AYA) who are newly diagnosed and receiving treatment for solid tumors, including lymphoma. Design/Methods: Twentynine AYA (ages 1222) diagnosed with a solid malignancy, including lymphoma, in the past 30 days who have begun cancerdirected therapy have been approached to participate. Participants were randomized to receive dim red light (DRL, n = 12) or bright white light (BWL, n = 11) for 30 minutes upon awakening daily for eight weeks. Side effects are assessed weekly via modified Systematic Assessment for Treatment Emergent Effects (SAFTEE). Results: Feasibility of the intervention was a priori defined as at least 65% of participants consenting to participate. At preliminary data check, 79.3% of approached participants (n=23) consented, demonstrating initial evidence of feasibility. To determine acceptability, a stopping rule was developed to evaluate side effects of extreme headache or eye strain after the first 15 participants completed intervention. Preliminary findings demonstrate that no DRL patients reported extreme headaches or eye strain. One BWL patient reported extreme blurred vision during week 2, and no BWL patients reported extreme headache. Conclusions: Preliminary findings of this feasibility and acceptability trial of bright white light to reduce fatigue in AYA newly diagnosed with solid tumors demonstrate that use of light therapy is both feasible and acceptable. Measures of fatigue, mood, and adherence continue to be collected and should provide additional information regarding potential efficacy of this promising intervention. PO-103 Managing Your Health: Development of a SelfManagement Skills Intervention to Overcome Barriers to Transition Readiness Among Adolescent and Young Adult (AYA) Cancer Survivors A. Viola 1, M. Masterson2, D. Carey2, S. Stephens2, S. Manne1, K. Devine1 1Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Medicine/Population Science, New Brunswick, USA; 2Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Medicine, New Brunswick, USA Background/Objectives: Childhood cancer survivors are a growing population who are at risk for adverse late effects from treatment. Survivors require lifelong \"riskbased\" followup care; however, less than 1 in 5 survivors obtain the necessary care. Many survivors are lost to followup in the transition from pediatric to adult followup care, partially due to low \"transition readiness\" or having the skills, motivation, and resources to make the transition. Few interventions have been developed to improve transition readiness among adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with cancer. This study aimed to identify the content of the selfmanagement intervention for AYA survivors. Design/Methods: Initial interviews with 19 AYA survivors of pediatric cancer identified barriers and facilitators to riskbased care. Next, we conducted interviews with 5 AYA survivors (ages 1825, 3 female), 1 parent and 3 medical providers to identify essential components of a selfmanagement intervention. Informed by these interviews and the SocialEcological Model of Readiness to Transition, the basic content of the intervention was developed. Three AYA survivors gave feedback on intervention modules. Thematic content analysis by two independent raters was used to identify targets for the intervention. Results: The major themes for the selfmanagement modules included: understanding treatment and the survivorship care plan, the logistics of managing health care and insurance, negotiating family involvement in care, dealing with emotions, and staying healthy in the context of life transitions. Initial feedback from the AYA survivors indicated that the content was relevant, but should include interactive elements (narrated presentations, videos, tailored feedback) to make the intervention more engaging. Conclusions: Incorporating AYA survivors, parents, and providers in the design phase has been essential to content development for the selfmanagement program. We are currently refining the content to be used in a randomized controlled trial with AYA childhood cancer survivors. PO-104 Psychological Challenges Faced When Fighting Childhood Cancer During Wartime in Syria O. Fawaz 1, A. F PATENAUDE2 1al bairouni university hospital for cancer, pediatric department, damascus, Syria; 2DanaFarber Cancer Institute, Center for Cancer Genetics and Prevention, Boston, USA Background/Objectives: Childhood cancer is a challenge for the child, his/her parents and medical care providers in limited resource countries. When war conditions and violence are present, treatment is much harder, physically and emotionally for all involved. Design/Methods: From observations and discussions with colleagues, patients and parents during the 7 years in which much of Syria has experienced war, we report on ways in which occurrence of war and associated hardships adds multiple burdens and challenges, threatening the psychological equilibrium and coping efforts of patients, parents and providers. Observations occurred at the Department of Pediatric Oncology at Al Bairouni Hospital in Damascus, one of 3 Syrian hospitals offering specialized pediatric cancer treatment Results: Disempowerment was the major psychological burden. Fear, anxiety and loss of hope were also difficult. Psychological challenges faced when treating cancer during wartime include: changing the life priority of the child and his/her family, lack of medication availability and increased costs, difficulties and dangers of transport of patients to and from the hospital location, and the heavy, resulting psychological impacts on patient, parents and medical care providers. Exposure to war and worry about the safety of near and distant family members affects medical care providers' attention, availability and energy as well. Conclusions: Childhood cancer is a complicated problem in Syria. Unsafe hospital locations and difficulties of transport during wartime and other problems create challenge in childhood cancer management and increase the psychological burdens facing patients, their families and health care providers. PO-105 A Service Evaluation Comparing the Need for Psychology Input Between Paediatric NeuroOncology Patients and Paediatric Oncology Patients Within the Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust Between 20052009 S. Haley 1, E. S. Wilkins2, K. Hospitals Trust, Paediaric Oncology, Leeds, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: Children with brain cancer are known to be more likely to suffer from suicidal ideation and depression than their other oncology counterparts. We hypothesised the need for psychological input would be higher in paediatric neurooncology patients compared to other paediatric oncology patients. We aimed to assess the need for psychological services within the paediatric oncology department and alter services to meet demand. Design/Methods: Patient data were collated from the database within the paediatric oncology department at LTHT from a five year period. We collected information on the patients' age at diagnosis, gender, tumour type and treatment received, including number of psychology referrals made and reasons for referral. Treatments types and combinations were coded for interpretation. Results: Data was collected for 556 patients, and of these, 102 were referred to clinical psychology services within LTHT. Nearly 45% of the neurooncology patients were referred to psychology compared to 12% in the other oncology group. There were no significant differences for gender or age. The most common treatment for a significant majority(?) of referrals was chemotherapy only - potentially due to long hospital stays and the disruption to daily life. Conclusions: The results are consistent with existing research strengthening further the argument for targeted specialised psychological support in this group. Clinical implications for the service are discussed. PO-106 Survivorship Identity in Childhood Cancer Survivors and their Parents: Results from Project Reach C. Hungr 1, L.B. Kenney1, C.J. Recklitis1 1Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Pediatric Oncology, Boston, USA Background/Objectives: Health implications of \"Survivor\" and \"Victim\" identity have been described in adult cancer survivors, but little is known about identity in childhood cancer survivors (CCS). This study investigated CCS and their parents' views on the child's survivorship identity, and the association of identity with the child's functioning. Design/Methods: Fiftynine CCS (34% female, Mean age=16.7) from a prospective cohort study rated their identification with \"Survivor\" and \"Victim\" identity on a fivepoint scale, perceived impact of cancer on their identity, and frequency of thought about their cancer. Parents completed parallel ratings on perception of their child's identity, impact of cancer on their child, and frequency of their own thoughts about their child's cancer. Identity terms were dichotomized into high and low (cutoff 3). Current functioning was assessed by the PedsQL. Results: Overall, few CCS (3.5%) or parents (5.2%) endorsed \"Victim\" identity, while a majority of CCS (78%) and parents (86%) endorsed \"Survivor\" identity. PedsQL scores were not associated with parent or child ratings of either identity. Within parentchild dyads, a significant number of parents (16/59) thought about the cancer more frequently than their child did (Kappa=0.19). Also, dyads disagreed significantly on endorsement of \"Survivor\" identity, where 19 of 59 dyads gave discrepant ratings (K=0.09). Of these 19, 12 resulted from parents endorsing their child as \"Survivor\" while their child did not. Dyads agreed significantly on the impact cancer had on child's identity (K=0.24). Conclusions: Few CCS or parents identify with the term \"Victim,\" though they commonly identify with the term \"Survivor.\" Although parentchild dyads agreed on the impact cancer had on CCS identity, parents overall thought about the cancer more frequently, and were more likely than their child to see their CCS as a \"Survivor.\" Notably, CCS identity was not related to qualityoflife. Future study could explore longterm functional implications of survivorship identity. PO-107 Putting Ayas in a Room Together: Launching an Adolescent and Young Adult Oncology Council R. Johnson 1, B. Pflugeisen2, P. Bridge Children's Hospital/MultiCare Health System, MultiCare Institute for Research and Innovation, Tacoma, USA; 3CanTeen Australia, CanTeen Australia, Sydney NSW, Australia Background/Objectives: Facilities and programs targeting adolescents and young adults (AYAs; aged 1539) are now emerging within community cancer centers in the United States. We describe the formation and first meeting of a community AYA stakeholder council and report the discussion themes and priorities of this group. Design/Methods: We created a stakeholder council to identify the healthcare needs and preferences of AYAs treated at community cancer centers. The group, which included nine patients/survivors, two parents, one spouse, one sibling, two researchers, and an AYAfocused child life specialist, convened at a oneday workshop moderated by CanTeen Australia. Participants shared and compared their healthcare experiences and identified unmet needs. Workshop notes were analyzed using inductive content analysis to identify themes. The group also prioritized topics for future discussion and action. Results: The experiences of AYAs treated at community centers varied widely, but the majority reported satisfaction with their cancer treatment experience. Experience, identity, expression, and advocacy were the major themes of discussion. The group was enthusiastic about sharing stories and advocating for others. They identified topics for future discussion by identifying and ranking the greatest healthcarerelated needs of AYAs at community medical centers. Peer connection was identified as the most pressing need, followed by government advocacy to improve programming and financial support, complementary medicine, research & clinical trials, staff education, choice & voice in decisionmaking, fertility, survivorship, and mental health services. Conclusions: Most AYAs reported positive treatment experiences at community medical centers. They desire more peer connection, financial support and empowerment in healthcare decisionmaking. PO-108 Development of the First Psychosocial Oncology Program in Armenia A. Kamalyan 1, Y. Asribabayan1, Fernandez2, B. Delaney2, G. Tamamyan1 1Muratsan Hospital Complex of Yerevan Medical University, Clinic of Chemotherapy, Yerevan, Armenia; 2DanaFarber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Oncology and Palliative Care, Boston, USA; 3DanaFarber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Global Health Initiative, Boston, USA; 4DanaFarber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Pediatric Stem Cell Transplant Center, Boston, USA Background/Objectives: Historically in Armenia, cancer has been viewed exclusively as a medical issue and there were no comprehensive psychosocial services offered to patients. In an effort to integrate psychologic care into multidisciplinary cancer care we developed a psychosocial oncology program. The aim was to provide support to pediatric and adult cancer patients and their families beginning at the time of diagnosis and continuing throughout the course of treatment. Thus, in March 2016 at the Clinic of Chemotherapy of Muratsan Hospital Complex of Yerevan State Medical University, with the support of DanaFarber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center Global Health Initiative (DF/BC GHI) and City of Smile Foundation, the first psychosocial oncology program in Armenia was established. The program is staffed by two psychologists (parttime). Design/Methods: Program development has included the review and analysis of examples of psychooncology delivery of care in high, low- and middleincome countries (LMIC), design of a psychosocial model of care, creation of a needs assessment tool and format for clinical progress notes, translation of psychoeducational materials for patients, families, providers, and development of mechanisms for involving volunteers into the service. These activities and others have been carried out in ongoing consultation with the specialists of DF/BC GHI. Results: As a result of the program development the following services are now available to patients and families: psychosocial assessment, individual psychotherapy for patients and their families, group counselling for children and parents, bereavement support, psychoeducation, organized sociocultural activities. During the first year 22 children and their parents (100% of pediatric patients, 176 discrete visits) and 58 adult patients and their relatives (48% of adult patients, 194 visits) received psychosocial support. Conclusions: Psychosocial programs for oncology patients can be successfully implemented in LMIC. Our program can serve as a model for other cancer delivery programs in Armenia and can be replicated in other LMIC. PO-109 The Struggle of Families Who Experienced Childhood Cancer and Great East Japan Earthquake Disaster K. Kamibeppu 1, K. Kurihara1, M. Ikeda1,2, I. Sato1, T. Rikiishi6 1The Universty of Tokyo, Department of Family Nursing Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan; 2Tokyo Women's Medical University, School of Nursing, Tokyo, Japan; 3Osaka University, Division of Health Sciences Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan; 4Miyagi Children's Hospital, Nursing Graduate School of Medicine, Miyagi, Japan Background/Objectives: To clarify the struggle of families who experienced two big trauma such as childhood cancer and the Great East Japan Earthquake Disaster. Design/Methods: This study is a part of an ongoing longitudinal study started in April 2015. We conducted a semistructured interview every 6 months for 3 years for 7 families who experienced childhood cancer and the earthquake. We analyzed the first interviews of the families by content analysis. Results: The children were diagnosed as ALL, AML, or neuroblastoma etc. at the age of 0 to 15. Four families have experienced the disease before the disaster. At the beginning of the hospitalization, almost all the children missed families and schoolmates. Some mothers suppressed their fear for the prognosis, and faced their children's disease optimistically. Fathers tended to give priority to work, but fathers' emotional support encouraged mothers. If parents needed the other family members' assistance (i.e. healthy siblings' or grandparents'), they shared the diagnosis with them. Some sibling somatized psychological distress during prolonged hospitalization, when no one played mother's role at home. The impacts of the disaster varied according to causes (earthquake, tsunami, or radioactive contamination) and degree of the damages they received. Some families had increased cohesiveness through facing the disease, and overcame the disaster. In the opposite direction, some families gained strength by overcoming the disaster, and struggled with the disease constructively. A survivor in their young adulthood reaffirmed that happiness means living a normal life. Conclusions: Although the families had experienced two big trauma, they were able to struggle with the second one in mighty heart in the case families had increased cohesiveness by the first one. We will analyze their longitudinal narratives to clarify challenges, because there might be longrun biopsychosocial effects of both trauma on the families. PO-110 Distress and Biopsychosocial Needs of Brazilian Adolescent and Young Adults Patients with Cancer M.F.M. Manhaes 1, C.D. Bergerot1 1Universidade Federal clinical and experimental oncology, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil Background/Objectives: A cancer diagnosis can negatively affect the biopsychosocial functioning of adolescents and young adults (AYA).This study aims to describe levels of, and relationships between, distress and biopsychosocial unmet needs in a sample of Brazilian AYA patients with cancer. Design/Methods: A study was conducted among 122 AYA patients with cancer aged 18 to 35 years, treated at a Brazilian public hospital. They were assessed using the Distress Thermometer, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy General. Descriptive statistics were obtained for all measures, itemlevel frequencies were examined to identify common unmet needs and relationships between distress and unmet needs were explored. Results: AYA patients were mostly were male (50.8%), single (54.1%), white (52.5%), diagnosed with, central nervous system (31.1%), hematologic (23%) or genitourinary (15.6%) cancers, at an advanced disease stage (41.8%). AYA reported greater distress (50%), being commonly related to practical (60.7%), emotional (73.8%) and physical (86.1%) problems. Financial (32%), worry (56.6%), nervousness (50%), sadness (31.1%), pain (47.5%), fatigue (39.3%), memory concentration (35.2%), and sleep (32%)were the highest scored. However, 25.4% reported clinical symptoms of anxiety and 9.8% of depression. AYA patients reported poor levels of quality of life that is at 50th percentile of the US norm. Distress, symptoms of anxiety/depression and quality of life were significantly associated with biopsychosocial problems reported (p<.001). Higher levels of distress was predicted by symptoms of anxiety (B=0.2; p<.001), depression (B=0.2; p<.01) problems. Conclusions: Brazilian AYA patients reported high levels and numbers of unmet needs and substantial distress. Strong associations were found between increased distress and more unmet needs. Findings suggest the need for psychosocial intervention for Brazilian cancer patients that target helping them cope with biopsychosocial distress. Further, this preliminary data highlight opportunities to reorientate services to better meet AYA needs. PO-111 Reflective Practice and Leadership in Global Pediatric Hematology/Oncology P. Mehta 1, J. Slone1, K. Chinyundo1, E. Ishigami2, Wasswa1, G. of Pediatrics, Houston, USA; 2Texas Children's Hospital, Cancer and Hematology Centers, Houston, USA Background/Objectives: TXCH Global HOPE operates projects in subSaharan Africa (SSA). Placement in leadership positions in such settings can present significant challenges beyond the scope of preservice orientation. We have expanded our evidencebased Reflective Practice & Leadership Seminar (RP&L) methods to provide ongoing leadership education for team members in SSA and fellows in the East African Pediatric HematologyOncology Fellowship Program. Design/Methods: One hour teleconference seminars are routinely conducted with faculty, staff and fellows in 4 sites in SubSaharan Africa. Seminar participants present current challenges and seasoned faculty guide the discussion through a disciplined, stepwise analysis including a \"diagnosis\" of the situation and a plan for strategic action - the leadership dimension of a health care professional's role. Results: Topics covered in the seminar included the challenges of introducing a new subspecialty into a country, bringing new staff members onto a team, negotiating care delivered by an ancillary incountry service, petitioning for resources within the context of a larger local organization, negotiating for the change of medical personnel provided through a separate institution, and negotiating change within an external institution that directly affects program function. Selfreport postseminar questionnaires indicated participants strongly agreed (5 on 15 scale) with the following statements: the seminar improved their ability to 1) analyze complicated clinical service situations 2) navigate interinstitutional politics, and 3) effectively build crossservice relationships to improve patient care. Conclusions: This Global Leadership Seminar has demonstrated success in helping our SSA staff and trainees improve leadership capacity and negotiate change effectively. PO-112 HealthRelated Quality of Life in Mothers with Children with Cancer: A Systematic Review C. Nicolaou 1 1Cyprus University of Technology, Nursing, Limassol, Cyprus Background/Objectives: Studies among parents of children with cancer have focused on anxiety, depression, or posttraumatic stress, and less so on overall measures, such as HealthRelated Quality of Life (HRQoL). Design/Methods: Literature review in Scopus and Cinahl with terms: mothers OR carers etc AND child* OR adolesc* etc AND cancer or oncolog* etc AND quality of life OR HRQoL etc, in 65 combinations. Selection criteria: mothers (or predominately in mixed samples), children aged<18 in active treatment (no palliative), quantitative, some measure of quality of life, comparative (e.g. population norms, or control group) or correlational, or baseline in interventions, English language, prior 2016. Results: Of 237 studies reviewed in fulltext among 2184, 10 fulfilled all criteria: 6 mothers only, 4 mixed with separate results for mothers, and additional 10 with sample of predominately mothers. With the exception of a series of studies from Canada (N>400), most studies had small sample sizes (N<150). European studies originated from limited number of settings. There were singlesample correlational studies (e.g. coping, anxiety, depression, sleep quality), internal comparisons (e.g. single vs twoparent families, time since diagnosis, or same group longitudinal, etc) or external (i.e. mothers of healthy children, or other diagnosis, or population norms). SF36 was commonly used. In studies with external comparison, quality of life was significantly reduced amongst mothers (or parents) of children with cancer. Despite crossnational heterogeneity, in studies that the SF36 commonly effect sizes were in the range of 0.51 SD for mental health and 0.5 SD for physical health dimension. Conclusions: Physical health as well as mental health aspects of the quality of life appear affected in this vulnerable group, highlighting the need to monitor and incorporate QoL as an outcome measure in assessing the effectiveness of psychosocial intervention programs.The main message is: The Quality of life is compromised in mothers of children with cancer. PO-113 Integrating Young Adult Feedback into the CrossCultural Adaptation of an Advance Care Planning Guide for Brazilian Youth Living with Cancer M. N. F. ArrudaColli 1,2, M. A. Santos1, S. Z. Bedoya2, \u00c9. A. OliveiraCardoso1, L. Wiener2 1University of Sao Paulo, Faculty of Philosophy and Letters at Ribeirao Preto, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil; 2National Cancer Institute, Pediatric Oncology Branch, Bethesda, USA Background/Objectives: Given the importance of having culturally appropriate tools to initiate advance care planning conversations with young adults, a crosscultural adaptation of Voicing My CHOiCESTM (VMC) in Brazil is underway. Design/Methods: VMC was translated to Portuguese by 2 bilingual translators. A synthesis version was defined and submitted for semantic validation by experts. Patients aged 1839 undergoing cancer treatment were then invited to evaluate the modified version in terms of clarity, cultural and age appropriateness, helpfulness and stressfulness. The revised version was backtranslated to English by 2 bilingual translators and discussed with VMC's authors to refine the final Portuguese version. Quantitative data were analyzed by descriptive analysis, while qualitative data were evaluated by thematic content analysis. Results: Nine experts and 15 patients were enrolled. Overall, experts evaluated the tool as \"totally adequate\" or \"adequate\" in regards to document structure, relevance of topics covered and adequacy of use across settings with the targetpopulation. Suggestions for adaptation focused on cultural, legal and linguistic aspects. The document was revised and then introduced to patients. Over 80% of the patients considered all topics covered to be age and culturally appropriate. Similarly, over 80% of the participants found all the topics to be \"very helpful\" or \"helpful\" except for the section that addresses funeral planning, which only 53% described as \"helpful\" and endorsed as being \"very stressful\". Patients' feedback focused on cultural aspects and how to incorporate the tool into the treatment trajectory. Conclusions: Obtaining the targetpopulation feedback during the semantic validation was essential to ensure appropriate linguistic and cultural adaptations. Further study with the adapted version of VMC in Portuguese will be implemented to evaluate the tool's feasibility and to identify potential burdens and benefits of its use. Acknowledgement: This study is supported by grant #2016/152693, Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) and in part by the NIH Intramural Research Program. PO-114 A MixedMethod Study Conducted in Parents and Professionals to Improve the Concept and Tools of a Psychosocial Intervention to Support Parents in Pediatric Oncology D. Ogez 1, C.J. Bourque1, K. P\u00e9loquin2, Canada Background/Objectives: Only two manualized intervention programs have been effective to reduce parental distress when the child is being treated for cancer: Bright Ideas and SCCIP. These programs bear some limitations related to dissemination, focus on the individual vs the family, etc., which we wanted to deal with in a new integrative program, taking the best of what is currently available. The aim of this preliminary study was to refine the design of an integrative program \"Regain control together\" a 6session facetoface intervention to support parents. Design/Methods: This sequential mixedmethod study called for two steps: (1) parents were invited to an information session on the intervention project and completed a questionnaire on objectives, procedure, manuals and tools; (2) after the descriptive analysis of the questionnaire responses, areas for improvement were discussed in a focus group of parents. The process was repeated with professionals. Descriptive analyses of questionnaire responses and a computerized thematic analysis (NVIVO) allowed for organizing different categories of recommendations for program refinement. Results: Six parents and six professionals participated in the study. The results showed the strengths of the program: pertinence for solving problem practical approach and couple intervention. The main areas of improvement were the accessibility of the language for the manuals and the adaptation of the program to different cultures. We discuss the program, recommendations of participants and changes made accordingly. A final version available for a formal Phase II pilottest is available and its core features will be presented. Conclusions: This study illustrates that it is necessary to include parents and final users in the elaboration of such intervention programs. The final version will now be available for gradual implementation and testing (feasibility, acceptability, and effects). PO-115 Anxiety, Depression, Burn Out and Post Traumatic Stress Disorders in Children with Cancer and Their Mothers A. Okur 1, E.O. Turkey; 2Gazi University, Pediatric Psychiatry, Ankara, Turkey Background/Objectives: The aim of this prospective study is to investigate the prevalence of anxiety, depression, burnout and posttraumatic stress disorder in pediatric oncology patients and their mothers. Design/Methods: Children and adolescents (n=60) aged 818 years who were actively treated or followedup in remission at Gazi University Pediatric Oncology Department and their mothers were recruited as the study group. The control group for anxiety, depression and burnout (n=30) consisted of children without chronic disease who were admitted to General Pediatric Clinic as outpatients and their mothers. Selfreport questionnaires measuring anxiety and depression were administered to the children and mothers. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) scale for children and mothers were performed as facetoface surveys in the presence of the clinician. The control group for PTSD (n=15) consisted of children and their mothers who experiered a serious traumatic event such as traffic accident, earthquake and close relative's death. Results: There was no significant difference with regard to anxiety, depression and burn out in terms of any scale score between children in remission and children under treatment. The mothers of children under treatment were significantly more traumatized and more anxious than those of children in remission. However there was no significant difference in burnout symptoms between mothers of children under treatment and mothers of children in remission. Children with cancer were more depressed and worried than control groups. Mothers of healthy children were significantly less depressed and anxious than mothers of children under treatment and in remission. We found that there were significantly more PTSD symptoms in patients both under treatment and in remission children and mothers of patients than the PTSD control group. Conclusions: These findings suggest that pediatric cancer is a significant stressor for both children and their mothers. Clinicians should be aware of psychiatric symptoms of children who underwent such a lifethreatening condition. PO-116 Quality of Life in Survivors of Bone Tumours at Hospital Infantil Background/Objectives: Patients with bone tumours (BT) undergo extensive and aggressive chemotherapy treatment and surgery, which can have significant acute and longterm effects on patients. Considering the high survival rates of childhood cancer, physical and psychosocial longterm effects, as well as assessment of healthrelated quality of life (HRQoL), are becoming new focus of clinical research. Patients with these diagnoses are at high risk of poor HRQoL compared to other childhood cancer survivors. Assesment the Quality of life in survivors childhood with BT. Design/Methods: Descriptive and observational study conducted at Hospital Infantil de Mexico \"Federico G\u00f3mez\". Eligible study participants were enrolled between August 2015 and July 2016. Participants completed a selfadministered questionnaire (KIDSCREEN52). The instrument measures ten dimensions: physical wellbeing, psychological wellbeing, moods and emotions, selfperception, autonomy, parent relations and home life, social support and peers, school environment, social acceptance (Bullying), and financial resources. Test items are rated on a 100point Likerttype scale. High scores indicate good quality of life Results: Thirteen BT survivors between 8 and 18 years old, who were followed at least one year after complete treatment, participated in this study. Twelve patients with osteosarcoma and one with Ewing Sarcoma. Seven were male. Four (30%) had metastasis at diagnosis. Seven (53.8%) had undergone amputation KIDSCREEN52 scores were 64 points for physical wellbeing, 75 for psychological, 76 for autonomy, 79 for school environment and social support and 95 for social acceptance. Conclusions: Although many BT survivors report excellent functional and HRQoL outcomes, a significant number report longterm disability and impairments. Further followup of this cohort, including reassessment to observe changes in scores and perceived disability over time, is clearly warranted. We hope this study will help provide patients and families with needed information about anticipated longterm outcomes and how to maximize function and RHQoL PO-117 School Performance of Childhood Cancer Survivors in Korea: A MultiInstitutional Study on Behalf of Korean Society of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Pediatrics, Cheongju, Republic of Korea; 2Yeungnam University College of Medicine, Pediatrics, Daegu, Republic of Korea; 3National Cancer Center, Pediatric Oncology, Goyang, Republic of Korea; 4Kyungpook National University School of Medicine, Pediatrics, Daegu, Republic of Korea; 5Ulsan University Hospital University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Pediatrics, Ulsan, Republic of Korea; 6Hanyang University College of Medicine, Pediatrics, Seoul, Republic of Korea; 7Keimyung University College of Medicine, Pediatrics, Daegu, Republic of Korea; 8Korea Cancer Center Hospital, Pediatrics, Seoul, Republic of Korea; 9Chungnam National University College of Medicine, Pediatrics, Daejon, Republic of Korea; 10DongA University College of Medicine, Pediatrics, Busan, Republic of Korea; 11Inje University Busan Paik Hospital, Pediatrics, Busan, Republic of Korea; 12Dankook University College of Medicine, Pediatrics, Cheonan, Republic of Korea; 13Inha University College of Medicine, Pediatrics, Incheon, Republic of Korea; 14Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Pediatrics, Seongnam, Republic of Korea; 15Cancer Research Institute Seoul National University College of Medicine, Pediatrics, Seoul, Republic of Korea Background/Objectives: Successful return to school after cancer diagnosis is important to facilitate the child's normal learning and attainment of academic skills. Absenteeism in vulnerable cancer survivors might exacerbate treatmentrelated learning challenges. In this study, we addressed the issue of peer relationship, school attendance and academic achievement. Design/Methods: Between July 2015 and December 2016, 15 institutions in Korea participated in this study on behalf of Korean Society of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (KSPHO). We studied 241 children treated for cancer who, at the time of study, were older than 9 years. The selfreported paperandpencil questionnaire was used in this study. Results: Approximately 21% of the survivors suffered from lack of friends. Bullying was reported by 29.4% of survivors. There was no difference in experiencing bullying according to disease categories. However, survivors who returned to primary school reported higher incidence of bullying compared to survivors who returned to middle or high school (22.9%, 10.6% and 6.1%, p=0.03). The percentage of children who missed classes more than 4 days in a month was higher in survivors with brain tumor than those with other tumors (52.6% vs. 31.8%, p=0.04). Survivors reported that they missed school due to physical illness or fatigue (58.0%), medical care (19.0%), and parents' concern (19.0%). Approximately 41% of children reported learning difficulty, mainly due to the difficulty in understanding the materials (58.0%) or concentration in classes (28.7%). Children who received hospital school support during cancer treatment repeated less often than children who did not (8.3% vs. 17.2%, p=0.05). The school marks in Korean language (p=0.03), English (p=0.04), and physical education (p=0.04) was worse for the children with brain tumors than for the children with other tumors. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that survivors of cancers require special care and attention when they return to school. Those treated for brain tumor remain particularly vulnerable. PO-118 An Examination of Barriers to Care and Illness Uncertainty in Parents of Children Newly Diagnosed with Cancer M. Perez 1, C. Sharkey1, D. Bakula1, A. Mullins1, S. Mayes2, University, Psychology, Stillwater, 2University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Oklahoma City, USA Background/Objectives: A subset of caregivers of children newly diagnosed with cancer are at risk for psychological distress. Both parental illness uncertainty (IU) and barriers to care have been linked to parental distress. Our previous research indicates that IU may mediate the relationship between barriers to care and distress. To further evaluate the pathways by which barriers to care may impact IU, the present study assessed the relationships between distinct barriers to care (i.e., pragmatics, skills, expectations, marginalization, knowledge/beliefs) and specific components of IU (i.e., ambiguity, lack of clarity, lack of information). Design/Methods: Caregivers (N=52) of children newly diagnosed with cancer (MDays =91.1, SDDays =52.3) were recruited at a Midwest medical center, and completed the Barriers to Care Questionnaire (BCQ) and the Parent Perception of Uncertainty Scale (PPUS) as part of a larger study on parental adaptation to the pediatric cancer diagnosis. Results: Expectations significantly predicted ambiguity (p=0.003), lack of clarity (p<0.001), and lack of information (p=0.002). Marginalization significantly predicted ambiguity (p=0.006), lack of clarity (p=0.001), and lack of information (p=0.012). Skills significantly predicted ambiguity (p=0.013) and lack of information (p=0.010). Knowledge/beliefs significantly predicted ambiguity (p=0.043) and lack of clarity (p=0.041). Pragmatics significantly predicted ambiguity (p=0.036). Conclusions: Caregivers who perceived low quality of care or personalized the negative experiences of their child's care experienced higher ambiguity and deficits in clarity and information concerning the illness. Parents who reported lower confidence in ability to manage their child's medical care, experienced ambiguity and lack of information regarding illness and treatment. Lastly, parents who disagreed with medical professionals about care reported increased ambiguity and lack of clarity. The results suggest that parents perceiving care as being of low quality or parents disagreeing with medical treatments are experiencing higher IU. Improvements in communication and relationships between caregivers and the clinical team may reduce barriers and IU, and potentially attenuate distress. PO-119 Treatment Intensity and HealthRelated Quality of Life in Pediatric Cancer Survivors: The Role of Psychosocial Family Functioning N. Racine1, B. Russell2, M. Khu3, K. Reynolds4, G. Guilcher3, F. 5 Psychology, Calgary, Canada; Hospital, Survivor Clinic, Calgary, Canada; Children's Hospital, Hematology Oncology Transplant Program, Calgary, Canada Background/Objectives: With increased survival of children treated for pediatric cancer, attention has turned to their longterm health and wellbeing. The aim of the current study was to examine treatment intensity as a risk factor for poor HRQL (HealthRelated Quality of Life) in pediatric cancer survivors. It was hypothesized that higher treatment intensity would be associated with lower HRQL. However, it was also hypothesized that family psychosocial functioning (including family cohesion, social support, and availability of resources) would buffer survivors from the deleterious consequences of high treatment intensities. Design/Methods: Fiftytwo pediatric cancer survivors (mean age=11.92 yrs, Range= 617 yrs) and their parents were recruited during routine followup appointments at a hospitalbased longterm survivor clinic and completed questionnaires addressing HRQL (PedsQL 4.0) and family psychosocial risk (PAT 2.0). Intensity of treatment was determined via a standardized tool (Intensity of Treatment Rating Scale) and was independently rated by two health care providers. Results: Multiple regression analyses revealed that after controlling for age, sex, and parent psychological distress, treatment intensity (b= .23, p = .04) and psychosocial family risk (b= .61, p<.001) negatively predicted parentproxy reported HRQL. Psychosocial family risk moderated the association between parent psychological distress and child HRQL (b= .64, p=.04). Conclusions: Higher levels of treatment intensity for cancer put children at risk for poor HRQL, which in turn has implications for longterm social and mental health outcomes. In the current study, a resiliency effect was observed, where children with a history of high levels of treatment intensity were buffered from experiencing poor quality of life if they had low psychosocial family risk. PO-120 DecisionMaking in Pediatric Oncology: Needs, Preferences and Experiences of Families E.G. Robertson 1,2, J. Fardell1,2, R. Cohn1,2,3, C. Wakefield1,2 1Sydney Children's Sciences Unit Kids Cancer Centre, Randwick, Australia 2UNSW Medicine The University of New South Wales, Discipline of Paediatrics School of Women's and Children's Health, Randwick, Australia; 3Sydney Children's Hospital, Kids Cancer Centre, Randwick, Australia Background/Objectives: Families of children diagnosed with cancer are faced with difficult treatment decisions, including radiation therapy, fertility preservation, and enrolling in research studies. Many patients and parents find it difficult to understand the rationale and implications of treatment options. They may also be at risk of experiencing decisional anxiety and conflict, uncertainty, and distress. We aimed to qualitatively explore the decisionmaking process of parents and young people when faced with a treatment decision, as well as any information needs and preferences. Design/Methods: We conducted semistructured interviews with recently diagnosed adolescents and parents. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed via content analysis using NVivo. To date, 3 adolescents (mean age=14y) and 8 parents (mean age of child=8y) have completed the interview. The study is still recruiting; anticipated study close is Mar17. Results: To date, 3 adolescents (mean age=14y) and 8 parents (mean age of child=8y) have completed the interview. Early findings suggest families often engage in parentdriven or parentchild shared decisionmaking, with the relationship with their clinician a major influence in the decision process. Parents tend not to include their child in major decisions (e.g. clinical trial enrolment) due to the age of their child, however acknowledge the importance for children to be involved in daytoday decisions (e.g. pain relief). Some parents express dissatisfaction with their level of decisionalinvolvement. Barriers to involvement include feeling distressed and overwhelmed with information. Conclusions: Decisionmaking in pediatric oncology is complex. Families require clearer information provided in multiple modalities, more guidance to engage in shared decisionmaking, and more emotional support throughout the decision process. These findings have contributed to the development of Delta - an online decisionaid supporting families deciding whether to enrol in a pediatric oncology clinical trial. PO-121 Returning Research Results Caregivers' Reactions Following Computerized Cognitive Training Among Childhood Cancer Survivors S. Scott 1, J. Ashford1, K. Clark1, K. MartinElbahesh1, H. Conklin1 1St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Psychology, Memphis, USA Background/Objectives: Few researchers routinely disseminate results following participation in a study; however, there is increasing acknowledgment that benefits of returning results far outweigh potential risks. Some researchers endorse returning research results as another component of ethical research. Among a pediatric population, specifically, it is important to determine the preference in which families would like to receive research results and guidelines for developing a clear summary of results. The current study explores the practice of returning results to families of childhood cancer survivors following participation in a computerized cognitive training program using Children's Oncology Group (COG) guidelines. Design/Methods: In a previous study, survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or brain tumor (BT; N = 68) with identified cognitive deficits were randomly assigned to participate in a computerized cognitive intervention or assigned to a waitlist. Following conclusion of the previous study, participants' families were contacted by postal letter, phone call, and/or patient approach and provided with a summary of results from the computerized cognitive training study and a survey gauging their interpretation of the summary, reaction to the results, and preference regarding the return of results. Results: Fortythree participants returned the survey and caregivers indicated they perceived the results as important (93.0%), helpful (93.0%), relevant to their child (90.7%), and easy to understand (97.7%). The results provided in the summary were mostly interpreted in a positive manner, with many endorsing satisfaction (83.8%) and/or relief (41.9%). Further, many caregivers preferred receiving research results through postal letter (88.4%) or email (46.5%). Conclusions: In summary, the benefits of returning research results regarding the effects of computerized training on childhood cancer survivors far outweigh the perceived risks. The practice of regularly returning research results can directly benefit families when making future healthcarerelated decisions, in addition to disseminating accurate, nuanced research results. PO-122 Long Term Positive and Negative Psychological Late Effects for Parents of Childhood Cancer Survivors: An Updated Systematic Review K. Shimmon 1, B. Phillips2, P. Siddell1 1leeds teaching hospitals, Paediatric Psychology, leeds, United Kingdom; 2University of York, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, York, United Kingdom Background/Objectives: The long term psychological effects of childhood cancer upon parents has been studied extensively, yet uncertainty remains about the degree and nature of any positive or negative psychological sequelae. This paper updates and expands upon a review assessing the literature published between 1988 and 2010 on the positive and negative long term psychological late effects for parents of childhood cancer survivors (CCS) reported at least five years after the child's diagnosis and/or two years after the end of the child's treatment. Design/Methods: Standard systematic review methods were employed. Two independent reviewers conducted searches in the databases CINAHL, EMBASE, PsychINFO and PubMed, performing quality appraisal using the QUALSYST tool and extracting data. Ninetyone possible papers were reviewed, 19 assessed in fulltext and 10 added, with a total of 25 finally included. Synthesis of the data was undertaken using a narrative framework, as heterogeneity of the underlying data collection precluded quantitative metaanalysis. Results: A total of 10 new studies including 880 parents were added. Overall, the majority of studies report no differences in levels of psychological distress for parents of survivors compared to norms, with a small subset reporting elevated levels of Post Traumatic Stress Symptoms (PTSS). Two additional studies found lower PTSS and/or higher Post Traumatic Growth (PG). Factors associated with negative long term late effects included: more avoidant coping styles, age of parent, caregiver strain and conflictive family functioning. Conclusions: There is little evidence to suggest that having a child with cancer results in general with increased levels of psychological distress for parents in the long term; some opportunities for personal growth may be experienced, but for others the events trigger PTSS. The clinical implications of these findings argue for awareness and specific referrals when required. PO-123 Depressive Symptomathology in 100 AYA Cancer Survivors: A Significant Predictive Model M. Tremolada 1, S. Bonichini1, G. Scarzello2, G. Basso3, M. Pillon3 1University of Psychology, Health Oncology Hematology Division, Padua, Italy Background/Objectives: Due to advances in chemotherapy and supportive care in the last years, the number of childhood cancer survivors has fortunately increased. Unfortunately, they could selfreport several negative psychosocial effects linked to the cancer treatment. A few studies adopted a mixedmethod approach crossing narrative data with those coming from selfreport questionnaires to identify the possible significant predictors of psychopathologic symptoms in their quality of daily life and in their relationships' characteristics. The aim of this study is to assess quality of daily life, family and social relationships in pediatric cancer survivors, adopting the mixed method to identify the possible psychosocial factors impacting on their depressive symptomatology. Design/Methods: Participants consists in 100 northeast Italian AYA cancer survivors, mean age at diagnosis of 9.26 years (SD=4.29), 51 treated for haematologic disease and 49 for solid tumours, offtherapy from a mean of 8.19 years (SD=2.62). The Ecocultural Family Interview (Tremolada et al., 2013). new version AYA cancer survivors took place in the DH of the Oncohematology clinic during their medical controls. This interview resulted psychometrically reliable and solid with the extraction of 12 good internal consistence general dimensions from 102 items. Selfreport questionnaires measuring feelings and emotions (CCSS) and the Brief Cope were administered as well. Results: A hierarchical regression analysis showed that depressive symptoms (R2 = 0.36; F = 7.14 p = 0.0001) were predicted by Age at diagnosis (beta = 0.41; p = 0.03), by Relationships with parents (beta = 0.22; p = 0.01) and by Selfblame coping strategy (beta = 0.41; p = 0.0001). Medical and sociodemographic variables didn't impact significantly. Conclusions: A good relationship with parents and older age at the diagnosis were identified as protective factors for depressive symptomatology, while selfblame coping strategy represented a risk factor. These empirical data should lead to focused interventions. PO-124 Child and Family Perspectives of Pediatric Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant: A Retrospective Pilot Study C. West 1, D. Dusome2, L. Rallison3, J. Winsor1 1University of Manitoba, College of Nursing, Winnipeg, 2Brandon University, Faculty of Health Studies, Winnipeg, Canada; 3University of Calgary, Faculty of Nursing, Calgary, Canada Background/Objectives: Pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is a highly intensive treatment. Children and family members experience significant illness distress, including anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress symptoms. The distress of family members plays a pivotal role in the level of distress experienced by ill children during HSCT. The key limitation of existing research is the \"family\" has primarily been studied from the perspective of individual family members, not the family unit. This study used a family systemsexpressive arts framework to identify the main factors that influence the family transition through HSCT, as well as specific family needs and outcomes. Design/Methods: A retrospective pilot study was conducted using constructivist grounded theory. Fifteen family members (9 parents/primary caregivers, 3 recipients, 3 siblings) from six families participated in two qualitative interviews. During the second interview, participants drew an image of how they experienced HSCT treatment. The researchers guided family members through a \"dialoguing with images\" process: each family member asked the image questions, and then answered those questions as if they were the image. Results: An inductively derived theory of the family transition through HSCT was developed:the preHSCT trajectory, including the relationship dynamics within the family and those with the health care team, were powerful modulators of this transition. A highly tenuous process of family fragmentation occurred during hospitalization. Experiences of trauma occurred, particularly for 'parent caregivers' who lived in the transplant room 24 hours/day, sustaining the ill child. During hospitalization, family members experienced one of two dominant patterns of interaction with health care professionals: expressionsupport (5 families) or conflictwithdrawal (1 family). Following discharge, families struggled to reintegrate, holding unvoiced experiences of trauma, which differed for each family member. Conclusions: We identified a crucial need for targeted family systemsexpressive arts intervention during the transition into HSCT and posthospitalization.

PO-125 Validating the PatientReported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS25) to Measure HealthRelated Quality of Life in Pediatric Lymphoma Patients in Malawi K. Westmoreland 1,2, T. van der Gronde3, A. Amuquandoh3, Itimu3, Medicine, Oncology Disease, Lilongwe, Malawi; 6University of North Carolina, Oncology and Infectious Disease, Chapel Hill, USA; 7University of North Carolina, Health Policy and Management, Chapel Hill, USA Background/Objectives: Measuring healthrelated quality of life (HRQoL) among cancer patients is important to comprehensively and holistically assess outcomes. Internationally validated tools to measure patientreported HRQoL are available, but efforts to translate and culturally validate such tools in subSaharan Africa (SSA) have been scarce. Design/Methods: The PatientReported Outcomes Measurement Information System 25item short form (PROMIS25) assesses six HRQoL domains: mobility, anxiety, depression, fatigue, peer relationships, and pain interference by asking four questions per domain. A singleitem pain intensity question is also included. The PROMIS25 instrument was translated into Chichewa: two forward independent translations, reconciliation, back translation, three independent reviews, finalization, and harmonization. Cultural validation was conducted through five semistructured cognitive interviews. Baseline questionnaires were collected for children enrolled in an ongoing prospective lymphoma cohort at Kamuzu Central Hospital in Lilongwe. Psychometric validity was assessed using Spearman's correlation among items within and across domains, Cronbach's alpha for internal consistency reliability within each domain, and ttest for known group validity. Results: The interviews discovered that the translation of being able to walk 'one block' was not culturally applicable; therefore, this item was changed to 'the length of one soccer pitch'. Thirtytwo lymphoma patients completed the PROMISE25 questionnaire. Items within each domain were more correlated than with items outside the domain supporting structural validity. Reliability of each scale was satisfactory (range alpha= 0.680.91). Children with a hemoglobin <9.0 g/dL had worse fatigue HRQoL than those with hemoglobin 9.0 g/dL (p=0.048). Children with a Lansky performance status (LPS) 70 had a worse mobility HRQoL than those with LPS >70 (p=0.002). Conclusions: Translation and cultural validation of the PROMIS25 into Chichewa for Malawi was successful. As pediatric cancer care and research programs expand in SSA, it will be vital to incorporate assessment of HRQoL using selfreported instruments validated within the local context. PO-126 Educational Interventions with Pediatric Sibling Hematopoietic Stem Cell Donors to Increase Knowledge of Donation and Reduce Anxiety: A Pilot Study L. Wiener 1 1NCI, Pediatric Oncology Branch, Bethesda, USA Background/Objectives: Siblings are most often selected as a donor match for patients with malignant and nonmalignant hematologic diseases. Research on preparing siblings donors for stem cell donation is limited. Current data suggests that sibling donors are at risk for depression, anxiety, withdrawal, behavioral problems, and lowered selfesteem. Even after donation procedures are explained, siblings have been found to have difficulty understanding the information and to experience anxiety. No prospective studies examining educational tools and transplant knowledge in sibling stem cell donors are currently available. Design/Methods: A study was designed to assess donor comprehension of donation procedures and to compare knowledge and anxiety prior to and post educational interventions. Participants include siblings of pediatric patients, ages 1026. Assessment of baseline knowledge and state anxiety is obtained before and after the consent/assent meeting with the medical team. Donors are then stratified into 2 groups by age. Donors' ages 10 to 15 play an adapted version of ShopTalk and donors' ages 16 to 25 are provided a workbook designed for sibling stem cell donors. Knowledge and anxiety is reassessed 24 hours following the intervention and again 1 month later. Results: 16 sibling donors enrolled, 7 completed all time points. Knowledge about how stem cells can help a cancer patient was very good at baseline. Areas lacking include how stem cells are collected and possible complications post donation and transplant. A trend for increased knowledge and reduced anxiety has been found post intervention. Enrollment is ongoing. Conclusions: Preliminary results suggest that education that provides information via a game or workbook increases knowledge and may reduce anxiety in sibling donors. Providing detailed information about donation and discussion of procedures should be tailed to the individual learning style and supplemented with additional visual information. PO-127 Advantages, Challenges and Opportunities in Working with Participatory Visual Approaches in Qualitative Research Involving Children and Youth in the Context of Cancer Research R. Woodgate 1, P. Tennent1, M. Zurba1 1University of Manitoba, Rady Faculty of Health Sciences College of Nursing, Winnipeg, Canada Background/Objectives: Since the mid1990s, participatory visual approaches in qualitative research have grown in popularity. Such creative approaches work towards facilitating the authentic expression of the complex realities of people engaged in research, as well as the more affective connections between people, their environments and life situations. The purpose of this presentation is to describe the use of participatory visual approaches including the advantages, challenges and opportunities in research that seeks to advance our understanding of children and youth's perspectives of cancer and cancer prevention. Design/Methods: The advantages, challenges and opportunities in working with participatory visual approaches including drawing and photovoice in qualitative research are gleaned from the literature and research conducted by the first author. Results: Participatory visual approaches such as drawing and photography enable children and youth in qualitative research to have a conversation with themselves by thinking through how they wanted to represent their own perspectives and experiences. Through participatory visual methods, they are able to produce powerful metaphors or literal depictions of their lived realities. Nonetheless, procedural, ethical and relational challenges in working with participatory visual approaches at various stages from activation to interpretation and dissemination can result including issues with data validity and authenticity. Conclusions: The insights derived from the literature and through the research provide standards for the advancement of participatory visual approaches in qualitative research that seeks to advance our understanding of children and youth's perspectives of cancer and cancer prevention. Enhancements to the didactic quality of the research, and considerations for extending participatory visual approaches into care following the completion of research are two areas where these approaches could be developed with great promise. PO-128 Navigating Ethical Challenges in Qualitative Research with Children and Youth Living with Cancer and Other Complex Conditions: Sustaining Mindful Presence R. Woodgate 1, P. Tennent1, M. Zurba1 1University of Manitoba, Rady Faculty of Health Sciences College of Nursing, Winnipeg, Canada Background/Objectives: A number of ethical challenges can emerge when engaging children and youth in qualitative research. The purpose of this presentation is to discuss how to mitigate ethical challenges in research that seeks to advance our understanding of children and youth living with cancer and other complex conditions. Design/Methods: Ethical challenges in qualitative research are explored by bringing forward examples from the first author's research program that is focused on the significance of multiple perspectives and the value of gauging the needs of young people living with cancer and other complex conditions. The studies address what children and youth think about their illness and contribute to building insights into their lived experience of illness. Results: In addition to highlighting the ethical challenges in working with children and youth in research, a case that ethical considerations need to extend beyond research ethics boards protocols is made. \"Sustaining mindful presence\" is proposed as a novel and inclusive framework through which researchers can navigate ethical challenges in research and involves moving through the research field with careful forethought, attentive pace and receptive attention to and awareness of what is taking place with the potential for the authentic expression of participants. Sustaining mindful presence includes the following characteristics that can become highly developed within a researcher: (i) openness and curiosity, (ii) empathy and acceptance, (iii) receptive attention and deep listening, (iv) relationally engagement, (v) flexibility and reflexivity, (vi) selfawareness and selfregulation, and (vii) being nonjudgmental and respectful. Conclusions: Through sustaining mindful presence, researchers are more able to provide a safe and comfortable research environment, consider the young person's physical and psychological state and avoid placing demands on the young people that could cause harm to them physically or psychologically, and make careful preparations for exiting from the field. PO-129 Who do Young Adults Talk to and What do they Talk About Regarding their EndofLife (EOL) Care Preferences S. Zadeh Bedoya 1, H. Battles1, Lyon2, Institute, Pediatric Oncology Branch, Bethesda, USA; 2Children's National Medical Center, Center for Translational Research, Washington, USA; 3Children's National Medical Center, Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Washington, USA; 4Children's National Medical Center, Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders, Washington, USA; 5Children's Hospital of Orange County, Hyundai Cancer Institute, Orange, USA; 6DanaFarber Cancer Institute, Young Adult Program, Boston, USA; 7Cook Children's Medical Center, AYA Oncology Program, Fort Worth, USA Background/Objectives: About 9,000 young adults (YA) die from cancer each year, making it the 4th leading cause of death in this age group (ACS, 2015). Advance care planning (ACP) documents provide patients an opportunity to express their preferences for care and make informed decisions. Both family and providers describe discomfort with initiating these conversations with AYA. This study aims to understand whether AYA are having ACP conversations with family members, friends or health care providers and if not, what barriers they perceive in doing so. Design/Methods: Participants, aged 1839, with cancer or other life threatening illnesses were administered a questionnaire to determine whether they had engaged in communication with family, friends, and/or health care providers about preferences for care if they were to become seriously ill. Perceived barriers to having these conversations was also assessed. The study is open at 5 cancer centers. Results: Fiftythree AYA completed the questionnaire. Fiftyone percent of participants indicated having had an EoL planning conversation with a family member, while only 30% had spoken with a friend and 17% with a health care provider. Perceived barriers to communication include upsetting family, a desire to maintain normal life with friends, and not feeling comfortable initiating discussion about ACP with their health care providers. Conclusions: Most particpants have not had communication regarding their EoL preferences with either family, friends, or health care providers. Given the importance of endoflife planning and challenges in ensuring these conversations occur with the medical team, interventions are being developed to enhance provider comfort with initiating these discussions and helping helping patients communicate with their family and friends about what is most important to them when their EoL is near. Epidemiology Pathway of Care PO-130 Incidence of CNS Tumors in Adolescents at a Children Hospital in Ecuador A. Borja 1, M.J. According to literature about 25% of all tumors in children between 0-14 years old involve CNS. However this percentage decrease at the end of adolescence(25% in adults). Most CNS tumors in childhood are located in posterior fossa but the most common type are astrocytomas. Due to differences in epidemiology and management the APP and NCI recommend that children seek diagnose and treatment at specialized pediatric centers for cancer. According to studies, children receiving care in those institutions show 2040% higher survival rates. However, survival outcomes in adolescents with CNS tumors have not shown an improvance. This dispartity shows adolescents have a higher mortality, hence, understanding of distribution of CNS cancer in this group will contribute to better, individualized treatments. Objetive: Determine incidence of CNS tumors in adolescents at Children Hospital in Ecuador from January 2007 to August 2013. Design/Methods: Descriptive, retrospective study including 406 patients from 015 years old. Inclusion criteria was, age between 9years11months and 14years11months old, and diagnostic of CNS cancer confirmed by Radiology or Pathology area. Results: Only 8.6% (n = 35)children from a total of 406 patients were diagnosed with CNS Tumor. Most of cases were found in males and mean age of diagnosis was ten years old(32%). Fiftyseven percent corresponded to posterior fosa but globally most common type was Astrocytoma(43%) and least was Ependimoma(3%). Results are similar to previously findings in England and US, only population admitted in this pediatric hospital was enrolled causing selection Bias. Conclusions: Cancer treatment in Adolescents is still being a challenge because poor improvement in survival rates seen despite of changes in management. This study shows that incidence of CNS cancer in adolescents between 1015 years old is similar to distribution in children described in previous studies. Therefore, other causes rather than distribution should be related to survival outcomes. New factors need to be investigated. PO-131 New Patient Process Documentation at Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt (CCHE) and Recommendations for Improvement O. Elmadhoun 1, N. Ugonabo1, I. Albanti2 1Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Health Policy and Management, Boston, USA; 2Dana Farber/Boston Children's Hospital, The Global Health Initiative, Boston, USA Background/Objectives: This project at the Children's Cancer Hospital of Egypt57357 (CCHE) aimed to define the new patient process for solid tumor patients, study the patient flow and analyze the process to be able to identify root causes and suggest actionable recommendations for improvement. CCHE is the largest specialized children's cancer hospital in the world and is located in Cairo, Egypt. Being the only hospital offering high quality pediatric oncology care completely free of charge, 57357 experiences a very high demand which necessitates continuous improvement in the handling of new patients in order to make the process efficient and enhance the patient experience. Design/Methods: Our project aimed to apply Lean Management - Six Sigma tools to define the new patient process, collect data on the new patient process, study the patient flow and identify root causes. We also used and incorporated the Dana Farber/Boston Children's Quality Improvement policies and toolkits. Results: The key findings of this project include a full process map of the New Patient Solid Tumor Process at both 57357 and Dana Farber/ Boston Children's as well other visual tools utilized in LEAN/Six Sigma. In addition, we drafted a list of ten preliminary recommendations for improvement which we presented to the 57357 team. Conclusions: Those recommendations laid the groundwork for the establishment of a new patient clinic to meet the high patient volumes and enhance the patient experience. PO-132 Early Diagnostic of Cancer Children and Adolescents Program in South of Brazil, 8 Years of Activities C. Fiori 1, A. Carla Rosa1, C. Brazil Background/Objectives: Introduction: In developed countries the cure rate of cancer children exceeds 75%. This reality is far from being achieved in Brazil and the main reason is the difficulty that health professionals have to diagnose the disease early. The Cancer Hospital of Cascavel UOPECCAN in partnership with the Ronald McDonald Institute, through the Early Diagnosis of Cancer Children and Adolescents Program, trains professionals of health and pediatrics of the municipalities of ParanaBrazil. Objective: Trainning professionals of health and pediatricians in order to contribute to the early identification of cancer in children and adolescents, reducing the time between the onset of signs and symptoms and diagnosis in a specialized center. Design/Methods: Methodology: Health professionals from several cities of Parana were trained from April / 2008 to December /2016. They received basic information about children cancer and adolescents (Epidemiology; signs and symptoms of suspicion; care needed for the attention to children and adolescents with cancer). The groups were formed with 40 professionals, 16 hours / course. Results: Results There were trained 1805 professionals, 125 doctors, 193 nurses, 305 technicians / nursing assistants, 836 community health agents, 184 upper level and 162 mediumlevel professionals or auxiliary. Conclusions: Comments: Among the diagnosed cases of cancer in children in Brazil, many are referred to treatment centers with the disease at an advanced stage. One goal of the campaign is to encourage educational and preventive actions, spreading knowledge for more people about the disease. We observed in the last three years, a cha nge in staging diagnosis of patients who are coming to the reference center. Children are coming up with more localized disease. Shortening the time between the suspicion of cancer and early diagnosis and treatment will certainly contribute to the increasing expectations of cure in developing countries. PO-133 Children's Cancer in Morocco: An 11Year Retrospective Study Habib2, A. Soulaymani1, A. Mokhtari1, H. Hami 1 1Laboratory of Genetics and Faculty Science, Tofail Kenitra, Morocco; 2Al Azhar Oncology Center, Rabat, Morocco Background/Objectives: This study was conducted to determine the epidemiological characteristics of childhood cancer in Morocco. Design/Methods: This is a descriptive retrospective analysis of childhood cancer cases, diagnosed and treated at Al Azhar Oncology Center in Rabat during a period of 11 years (20052015). Results: During the study period, 115 children under the age of 15 were diagnosed with cancer at Al Azhar Oncology Center, accounting for 1.05% of all new cancer cases reported during this period. Nearly twothirds were boys with a malefemale ratio of 1.94. The average age at diagnosis was 8.45\u00b13.99 years. More than a quarter of the reported cases were diagnosed during the first five years of life, while the highest rate for children was noted between 10 and 14 years of age. Brain tumors were the most common childhood cancer (15%), followed by cavum cancer (13%). Among all detected cases, 2.6% were diagnosed with metastatic disease and 13.9% died during the study period. Conclusions: Although rare, cancer in children has a substantial impact on public health in Morocco. A national cancer registry will assist in better planning, resource allocation and management including psychosocial support to improve the quality of life of childhood cancer survivors and their families. PO-134 Financial Planning of Pediatric Cancer Hospitals in LowandMiddleIncome Countries: The Unidad Nacional de Oncologia Pediatrica's Experience G. De Dios3, I. Albanti4 1Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Health Policy and Management, Boston, USA; 2Unidad Nacional de Oncolog\u00eda City, Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Pediatric Oncology, Boston, USA Background/Objectives: While financial planning resources for the establishment of new pediatric oncology facilities in lowandmiddleincome countries (LMICs) are limited, Unidad Nacional de Oncolog\u00eda Pedi\u00e1trica (UNOP), Guatemala's national pediatric cancer hospital, in partnership with its foundation, Ay\u00fadame a Vivir (AYUVI), has sustainably operated for more than 15 years and has recently expanded to a new clinical site. This study aims to examine financial planning practices at UNOP and AYUVI, highlight important lessons learned, and assess the impact of effective budgeting on improving outcomes for children with cancer in Guatemala. Design/Methods: Semistructured facetoface key informant interviews were conducted with 9 staff members (physicians, administrators, accountants, and staff in volunteering and fundraising) in English or Spanish at UNOP and AYUVI. Interview content was transcribed and analyzed to identify recurring themes. Informants also provided relevant financial planning documentation. Results: Interviewees emphasized the importance of having diverse funding sources including the government, corporate sponsorships, and both local and international fundraising to prevent reliance on a sole funder. For budgeting, respondents highlighted the importance of gathering local epidemiological data to forecast disease burden and patient demand. These data are used to determine required number of patient beds, necessary quantities of equipment, and required clinical staff, which directly influence the construction, startup, and operational budgets. Informants noted several costs unique to pediatric cancer hospitals including the increased need of isolation areas and infectious disease care for immunocompromised patients, and the need to plan for lodging for parents from faraway locations to stay during longer treatments. Conclusions: UNOP's ability to increase Guatemala's overall survival rate from pediatric cancer from 20% to 70% over 15 years has been made possible in part due to strategic and effective financial management. This institution's continued success highlights the feasibility of providing costeffective access to care for children living with cancer in resourcelimited settings. Late Effects PO-135 Rendering of Rehabilitation Help to the Russian Children with Oncohematological Disordes E. Zhukovskaya1, A. Rumyantsev 2, V. Kasatkin1, Administration, Moscow, Russia Background/Objectives: The longterm consequences of chemoradiotherapy are preserved until 310 years or more after completion of treatment in children and adolescents. The aim of the research is analysis of the rehabilitation care for children and adolescents in Russian Federation cured of malignant neoplasms. Design/Methods: The rehabilitation care to patients with oncohematological pathology in 24 centers and clinics in Russian Federation were studied within the framework of the multicenter study. The sources of the data were official statistical reports and a questionnaire for physicians, including 22 parameters studied, 2,320 parents were interviewed with a prepared questionnaire. Results: Rehabilitation of patients cured of malignant neoplasms is carried out in rehabilitation departments of 3 regional hospitals, 3 specialized rehabilitation centers, in 14 cities, children receive rehabilitation courses during special shifts in children's sanatoriums, dispensaries. \"National Scientific and Practical Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology named after. Dmitry Rogachev\u00bb is a methodical center for the delivery and testing of rehabilitation technologies. Only 20% of survivors received rehabilitation courses in connection with insufficient number of the rehabilitation wards. The late effects of antitumor therapy were registered in 68.7% of patients aimed at rehabilitation had organic and functional health disorders, manifestations of deprivation and desocialisation, which caused the need to develop technologies for drug, nutritional, neurocognitive, physical and psychological and social rehabilitation of recovered patients. The parents' survey revealed the interest of families of patients in expanding rehabilitation opportunities; they prefer rehabilitating in the conditions of specialized centers. Conclusions: The doctors emphasize the lack of trained personnel in the field of restorative medicine,absence of the evidence based criterias of the causal patterns of the development revealed symptomatology, premorbid/comorbid conditions that limit the effectiveness of rehabilitation programs for patients with oncohematological diseases.The expense of compulsory medical insurance, social protection system ensures accessibility for families with children cured of malignant tumors.
