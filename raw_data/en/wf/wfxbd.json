SELF SURVEY F223 ________________________________________________________________________- REGULATION: F223 \u00a7483.13(b) Abuse The resident has the right to be free from verb al, sexual, physical, and me ntal abuse, corporal punishment, and involuntary seclusion. Intent \u00a7483.13(b): Each resident has the right to be free from abuse, corporal punishment, and involuntary seclusion. Residents must not be subjected to abuse by anyone, including, but not limited to, facility staff, other residents, consultants or volunteers, staff of ot her agencies serving the resident, family members or legal guardians, friends, or other individuals. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7483.13(b) and (c) \"Abuse\" means the willful infliction of injur y, unreasonable confinement, intimidation, or punishment with resulting physical harm, pain or mental anguish.\" (42 CFR \u00a7488.301). This also includes the deprivation by an individual, incl uding a caretaker, of goods or services that are necessary to attain or maintain physical, mental, and psychosocial wellbeing. This presumes that instances of abuse of all residents, even those in a coma, cause physical harm, or pain or mental anguish. \"Verbal abuse\" is defined as the use of oral, written or gestured la nguage that willfully includes disparaging and derogatory terms to re sidents or their families, or within their hearing distance, regardless of their age, ability to comprehend, or disability. Examples of verbal abuse include, but are not limited to: th reats of harm; saying th ings to frighten a resident, such as telling a reside nt that he/she will never be able to see his/her family again. \"Sexual abuse\" includes, but is not limited to, sexual harassment, sexual coercion, or sexual assault. \"Physical abuse\" includes hitting, slapping, pinching and kicking. It also includes controlling behavior thr ough corporal punishment. \"Mental abuse\" includes, but is not lim ited to, humiliation, harassment, threats of punishment or deprivation. \"Involuntary seclusion\" is defi ned as separation of a resident from other residents or from her/his room or confinement to her/his room (with or without roommates) against the resident's will, or the will of the resident's legal representative. Emergency or short term monitored separation from other Residents will not be considered involuntary seclusion and may be permitted if used for a limited peri od of time as a therapeutic intervention to reduce agitation until professional st aff can develop a plan of care to meet the resident's needs. Investigation of possible involuntar y seclusion, may involve one of two types of situations: that in which residents are living in an area of the facility that restricts their Revised September 2007 Page 1 Revised September 2007 Page 2 freedom of movement throughout the facility, or that in which a resident is temporarily separated from other residents. If the stated purpose of a unit which preven ts residents from fr ee movement throughout the facility is to provide sp ecialized care for residents who are cognitively impaired, then placement in the unit is not considered involunta ry seclusion, as long as care and services are provided in accordance with each resident 's individual needs a nd preferences rather than for staff convenience, and as long as th e resident, surrogate, or representative (if any) participates in the placement decision, and is involved in continuing care planning to assure placement continues to meet resident needs and preferences. If a resident is receiving emergency short- term monitored separation due to temporary behavioral symptoms (such as brief catastrophic reactions or combative or aggressive behaviors which pose a threat to the resident, other resident s, staff or others in the facility), this is not considered involuntary se clusion as long as this is the least restrictive approach for the minimum amount of time, and is being done according to resident needs and not for staff convenience. SELF SURVEY MODULE 483.13 (c) STAFF TREATMENT OF RESIDENTS TAG F224 __________________________________________________________________ \u00a7483.13(c) Staff Treatment of Residents (F 224* and F226**) The facility must develop and implement wri tten policies and procedures that prohibit mistreatment, neglect, and abuse of residents and misappropriation of resident property. \u00a7483.13(c)(1)(i) Staff Treatment of Residents (1) The facility must-- (i) Not use verbal, mental, sexu al, or physical abuse, corporal punishment, or involuntary seclusion; * Intent \u00a7483.13(c) (F224) Each resident has the right to be free from mistreatment, neglect and misappropriation of property. This includes the facility's identifi cation of residents w hose personal histories render them at risk for abusing other resident s, and development of intervention strategies to prevent occurrences, monitoring for change s that would trigger abusive behavior, and reassessment of the interventions on a regular basis. * Use tag F224 for deficiencies concerning mi streatment, neglect, or misappropriation of resident property. * Guidelines \u00a7483.13(c) (F224) \"Neglect\" means failure to pr ovide goods and services neces sary to avoid physical harm, mental anguish, or mental illness. (42 CFR 488.301) \"Misappropriation of resident property\" mean s the deliberate mispla cement, exploitation, or wrongful, temporary or permanent use of a resident's belongings or money without the resident's consent. (42 CFR 488.301) DATA COLLECTION: OBSERVATIONS: A.

Revised September 2007 Page 1 RECORD REVIEW: Review facility's policies/procedures and record documentation. Do they include the following components and are these components operationaliz ed? : (All of the fo llowing are not required, but are examples of what makes up a good program/policy and procedures). Screen potential applicants for a history of abus e, neglect or mistreating residents? Does the provider have a comprehensive interview process for potential hires? Does the provider check and documents references beyond the minimum information that is legally required? Does the provider check the prospe ctive employee's work history? Does the provider check criminal background for direct care staff? Check Personnel files for references, wo rk history, criminal background check, qualifications and training records Review staff schedules to confirm adequacy of staffing based on need and observations of individuals receiving serv ices. Do staff volume and quali fications match individual needs? Review provider's methods for detecting and preventing abuse and neglect and/or data pertinent to recruitment and /or hiring practices. Train employees through orientat ion and ongoing sessions on i ssues related to abuse prohibition practices? Training for employees should include the following: Basic communication skills Conflict resolution and anger management Clinical presentation of dementia, mental illness, developmental disabilities, cognitive impairment and strategies for communication Effect of cognitive impairment on communication and function Successful ways of coping with maladaptive behaviors. Knowledge of and respect for individual rights Staff behaviors that can elicit negative re sponses by individuals receiving services. Effect of disease specific and age related changes. Approaches and care necessary to detect and prevent feelings such as loss of control and resulting depression Restorative care that utilizes commonly accep ted approaches to help the individual function at his or her optimal level. Promotion of individual rights. Check training records for evidence that st aff have received upon orientation and on a regular basis thorough and accurate tr aining regarding abuse and neglect: Education on individual rights Conflict resolution training Coping with maladaptive behaviors. Education on cognitive challenges, mental illn ess, dementia, developmental disabilities, including communication techniques. Meeting the specific needs of the population. Response : The facility should provide residents, families and staff information on how and to whom they may report concerns, incidents and gr ievances and provide feedback regarding the concerns that have been expressed? Revised September 2007 Page 2 Are all allegations responded to and treated with the same degree of consideration and seriousness regardless of their nature? Was the response prompt? What care and attention are given to the indi viduals involved in the incident following the reporting of the incident? Was immediate action taken to protect the vi ctim and to address the behavior of the perpetrator? Review the corrective action plan that should be put into place. What did the facility do in response? Train/retrain staff? Rewrite policies and procedures? Revise the sy stem to better respond? Identification: Did the facility identify events, occu rrences, patterns and trends that may constitute abuse and determine th e direction of the inve stigation? Do the po licies and procedures address this? Typical abusers are direct caregivers are of ten the lowest paid workers in the most understaffed areas of facilities Some times facilities do not take allegations of abuse seriously or the reporter is afraid of retaliation. Does the facility have a method of recognizi ng factors that lead to abuse and neglect such as job burnout, inability to manage conflict, stress and insufficient training? Many times perpetrators are male, new hires and second-shift workers Low wages and poor benefits, compounded by the emotional and physical strain of the work contribute to quality control problems in long term care. Review the administrative structures such as the policy and procedures to see if they are contributing to abuse and neglect problems. External factors such as employment levels and pay rates can affect staffing. Tradition: long-standing practice in some settings can discourage attachment between individuals receiving services and those providing services. Isolation: some individuals who live in instit utions are isolated a nd have little contact within the community. Institutional environment such as the size and physical design of the building can affect the care provided. The facility should identify staff characteristic s that can contribute to neglect and abuse, such as experience level, e ducational level, challenging pers onal life style choices, and ethnic and cultural backgrounds. The facility should identify the characteristics of individual receivi ng services such as dependent, frail, chronically ill, impaired functi ons, and mentally incapacitated as well as residents being physically or verbally aggressive. Review incident reports. Investigate: Review different types of incidents and id entify the staff member responsible for the initial reporting, inve stigation of alleged violations a nd reporting of resu lts to proper authorities. Do the policy and procedures addre ss how to investigate the incident? Protection: How does the facility protect residents from harm during an investigation? Do the policy and procedures address this? How does the facility protect the rights of individuals re ceiving services? Are residents separated? Roommate change or staffing changes? Revised September 2007 Page 3 Staff changed, suspended, reassigned to other tasks during th e investigation? Is there a policy and procedure to determine if there is a mechanism in place to protect reporters, victims and suspected perpetrators? Does the documentation of the incident reflect efforts to protect the individual from the potential abuser? Report: Does the facility have a policy and proce dure on reporting all alle ged violations and all substantiated incidents to the State Agency and all other agencies as required? Does the facility then take all necessary corrective actions depending on the results of the investigation? Has the state agency (health care personnel registry been notif ied within 24 hours)? Has an investigative report been completed as required? Does the investigation have the following: Individual and caregiver in terviews, as indicated? Clinical examination? Staff interviews? Collaboration with state agencies? Methods to support the individual and dete ct and prevent further victimization. Was the resident examined in a thorough and timely manner? The Abuse Investigative Protocol requires that the survey team: 1. Review 2-3 alleged violations since th e previous time this was reviewed by the state. Review the written evidence to determin e how the facility has handled alleged violations. Did the facility impl ement adequate procedures for: Reporting and investigating? Protection of the resident during the investigation? Provision of corrective action? 2. From a list of employees hired within the previous four months , select 5 new hires and review written evidence from the f acility that the f acility conducted pre- screening checks based on regulat ory requirements at 42 CFR 483.13(c). 3.

SELF SURVEY MODULE 483.25 (c) _____________________________ REGULATION: F314 \u00a748 3.25(c) Pressure Sores Based on the comprehensive Assessment of a resident, the facility must ensure that-- (1) resident who enters the facility without pressure sores does not develop pressure sores unless the individual's c linical condition demonstrates that they were unavoidable; and (2) resident having pressure sores receives necessary treatment and services to promote healing, prevent infection and prevent new sores from developing. Intent: (F314) 42 CFR 483.25(c) The intent of this requirement is that th e resident does not develop pressure ulcers unless clinically unavoidable and that the facility provides care and services to: Promote the prevention of pr essure ulcer development; Promote the healing of pressure ulcers that are present (inc luding prevention of infection to the extent possible); and Prevent development of a dditional pressure ulcers. NOTE: A though the regulatory language refers to pressure sores, the nomenclature widely accepted presently refers to pre ssure ulcers, and the guidance provided in this document will refer to pressure ulcers. DEFINITIONS Definitions are provided to clarify clinical terms related to pressure ulcers and their evaluation and treatment. \"Pressure Ulcer\"- A pressure ulcer is any lesion caused by unrelieved pressure that results in damage to the underlying tissue(s). 1 Although friction and shear are not primary causes of pressure ulcers, friction and shear are important contri buting factors to the development of pressure ulcers. \"Avoidable/Unavoidable\" Pressure Ulcers o \"Avoidable\" means that the resident develope d a pressure ulcer a nd that the facility did not do one or more of the following: eval uate the resident's clinical condition and pressure ulcer risk factors; define and impl ement interventions that are consistent with resident needs, resident goals , and recognized standards of pr actice; monitor and evaluate the impact of the interventions; or re vise the interventions as appropriate. o \"Unavoidable\" means that the resident de veloped a pressure ulcer even though the facility had evaluated the resident's clinical condition and pressure ulcer risk factors; defined and implemented interventions that are consistent with resident needs, goals, and recognized standards of practice; monito red and evaluated the impact of the interventions; and revised th e approaches as appropriate. \"Cleansing/Irrigation\" o \"Cleansing\" refers to the use of an appropr iate device and solution to clean the surface of the wound bed and to remove the looser fore ign debris or contaminants in order to decrease microbial growth. 2 Revised September 2007 Page 1 o \"Irrigation\" refers to a type of mechanical debridement, which uses an appropriate solution delivered under pressure to the w ound bed to vigorously attempt to remove debris from the wound bed. 3 \"Colonized/Infected\" Wound 4, 5 o \"Colonized\" refers to the presence of bact eria on the surface or in the tissue of a wound without the signs and symptoms of an infection. o \"Infected\" refers to the presence of micr o-organisms in sufficient quantity to overwhelm the defenses of viable tissue s and produce the signs and symptoms of infection. \"Debridement\"- Debridement is the removal of devitalized/necrotic tissue and foreign matter from a wound to improve or facilitate the healing process. 6, 7, 8 Various debridement methods include: o \"Autolytic debridement\" refers to the use of moisture retentive dressings to cover a wound and allow devitalized tissue to self-digest by the action of enzyme s present in the wound fluids. o \"Enzymatic (chemical) debridement\" refers to the topical application of substances e.g., enzymes to break down devitalized tissue. o \"Mechanical debridement\" refers to the remo val of foreign material and devitalized or contaminated tissue from a wound by physical rather than by chemical or autolytic means. o \"Sharp or surgical debridement\" refers to removal of foreign mate rial or devitalized tissue by a surgical instrument. o \"Maggot debridement therapy (MDT)\" or medici nal maggots refers to a type of sterile intentional biological larval or biosurgical debridement that uses disinfected (sterile) maggots to clean wounds by dissolving the dead and infected tissue and by killing bacteria. 9 \"Eschar/Slough\" o \"Eschar\" is described as thic k, leathery, frequently black or brown in color, necrotic (dead) or devitalized tissue that has lost its usual physical properties and biological activity. Eschar may be loose or firmly adhered to the wound. o \"Slough\" is necrotic/avascular tissue in the process of separating from the viable portions of the body and is usually light co lored, soft, moist, a nd stringy (at times). \"Exudate\" o \"Exudate\" is any fluid that has been forced ou t of the tissues or it s capillaries because of inflammation or injury. It may contain se rum, cellular debris, ba cteria and leukocytes. o \"Purulent exudate/drainage/discharge\" is a ny product of inflammation that contains pus (e.g., leukocytes, bacteria, and liquefied necrotic debris). o \"Serous drainage or exudate\" is watery, clear, or slightly yellow/tan/pink fluid that has separated from the blood and presents as drainage. \"Friction/Shearing\" o \"Friction\" is the mechanical force exerted on skin that is dragged across any surface. o \"Shearing\" is the interacti on of both gravity and friction against the surface of the skin. Friction is always presen t when shear force is present. 10 Shear occurs when layers of skin rub against each other or when the skin remains stationary and the underlying tissue moves and stretches and angulates or tear s the underlying capillar ies and blood vessels causing tissue damage. \"Granulation Tissue\" Revised September 2007 Page 2 o \"Granulation tissue\" is the pink-red mois t tissue that fills an open wound, when it starts to heal. It contains new blood vessels, collagen, fibroblasts, and inflammatory cells. \"Tunnel/Sinus Tract/Undermining\"-Tunnel and sinus tract are often used interchangeably. o \"Tunneling\" is a passageway of tissue destru ction under the skin su rface that has an opening at the skin level from the edge of the wound. o A \"sinus tract\" is a cavity or channel underlying a wound th at involves an area larger than the visible surface of the wound. o \"Undermining\" is the destruction of tissu e or ulceration exte nding under the skin edges (margins) so that the pre ssure ulcer is larger at its ba se than at the skin surface. Undermining often develops from shearing forces and is differentiated from tunneling by the larger extent of the wound edge involved in undermining and the absence of a channel or tract extending from the pre ssure ulcer under the adjacent intact skin. INVESTIGATIVE PROTOCOL PRESSURE ULCER Objectives To determine if the identified pressure ulcer(s) is avoidable or unavoidable; and To determine the adequacy of the facility's interventions and efforts to prevent and treat pressure ulcers. Use Use this protocol for a sampled resident havi ng--or at risk of developing-- a pressure ulcer. If the resident has an ulcer, determine if it was identified as non- pressure related, e.g., vascular insufficiency or a neuropathic ulce r. If record review, staff and/or physician interview, and observation ( unless the dressing protocol precludes observing the wound) support the conclusion that the ulcer is not pressure related, do not proceed with this protocol unless the resident is at risk for developing, or also ha s, pressure ulcers. Evaluate care and services regarding non-pressure related ulcers at F3 09, Quality of Care. Procedures Briefly review the assessment, care plan and orders to identify facility interventions and to guide observations to be made. For a newly admitted resident either at risk or with a pressure ulcer, the staff is expected to assess and provide appropriate care from the day of admission. Corroborate observations by interview and record review. 1. Observation Observe whether staff consistently imple ments the care plan over time and across various shifts. During observations of th e interventions, note and/or follow up on deviations from the care plan as well as potential negative outcomes, including but not limited to the following: Erythema or color changes on areas such as the sacrum, buttocks, trochanters, posterior thigh, popliteal area, or heels when moved off an area: o If erythema or color change are noted, return approximately \u00bd - \u00be hours later to determine if the changes or other Stage I characteristics persist; o If the changes persist and exhibit te nderness, hardness, or alteration in temperature from surrounding skin, ask st aff how they determine repositioning schedules and how they evaluate and addr ess a potential Stage I pressure ulcer; Revised September 2007 Page 3 Previously unidentified open areas; Whether the positioning avoids pressu re on an existing pressure ulcer(s); Measures taken to prevent or reduce the potential for shearing or friction during transfers, elevation, and repositioning; and Whether pressure-redistributing devices fo r the bed and/or chair, such as gel- type surfaces or overlays are in place, working, and used according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Observation of Existing Ulcer/Wound Care If a dressing change is scheduled dur ing the survey, observe the wound care to determine if the record reflects the cu rrent status of th e ulcer(s) and note: Characteristics of the wound and surrounding tissues such as presence of granulation tissue, the Stage, presence of exudates, necr otic tissue such as eschar or slough, or evidence of erythema or swelling around the wound; The form or type of debridement, if used; Whether treatment and infection control practices reflect cu rrent standards of practice; and Based on location, steps taken to clean se and protect the wound from likely contamination by urine or fecal incontinence. If unable to observe the dr essing change due to the dr essing protocol, observe the area surrounding the ulcer(s). For ulcers with dressings that are not scheduled to be changed, the surveyor may request that the dressing be removed to observe the wound and surrounding area if other informa tion suggests a possible treatment or assessment problem. If the resident expresses (or appears to be in) pa in related to the ulcer or treatment, determine if the facility: Assessed for pain related to the ulcer, addressed and monitored interventions for effectiveness; and/or Assessed and took preemptive measures for pain related to dressing changes or other treatments, such as debridement/irrig ations, and monitored for effectiveness. 2. Resident/Staff Interviews Interview the resident, family or responsible party to the degree possible to identify: Involvement in care plan, choices, goals, and if interventions reflect preferences; Awareness of approaches, such as pressu re redistribution devices or equipment, turning/repositioning, weight shifting to prevent or address pressure ulcer(s); Presence of pain, if any, and how it is managed; If treatment(s) was refused, whether c ounseling on alternativ es, consequences, and/or other interventions was offered; and Awareness of current or history of an ul cer(s). For the reside nt who has or has had a pressure ulcer, identify, as possible, whether acute illness, weight loss or other condition changes occurred prior to developing the ulcer. Interview staff on various shifts to determine: Knowledge of prevention and treatm ent, including facility-specific guidelines/protocols and specific interventions for the resident; If nursing assistants know what, when, a nd to whom to report changes in skin condition; and Revised September 2007 Page 4 Who monitors for the implementation of the care plan, changes in the skin, the development of pressure ulcers, and the fr equency of review and evaluation of an ulcer. 3. Record Review Assessment Review the RAI and other documents such as physician orders, progress notes, nurses' notes, pharmacy or dietary no tes regarding the a ssessment of the resident's overall condition, risk factors and presence of a pressure ulcer(s) to determine if the facility identified the re sident at risk and evaluated the factors placing the resident at risk: For a resident who was admitted with an ulcer or who developed one within 1 to 2 days, review the admission documentation regarding the wound site and characteristics at the ti me of admission, the possib ility of underlying tissue damage because of immobility or illness prior to admission, skin condition on or within a day of admission, history of impa ired nutrition; and history of previous pressure ulcers; and For a resident who subsequently developed or has an existing pressure ulcer, review documentation regarding the wound site, characteristics, progress and complications including reassessment if there were no signs of progression towards healing within 2 to 4 weeks. In considering the appropriateness of a facility's respons e to the presence, progression, or deterioration of a pressure ulcer, take into account the resident's condition, complications, time needed to determine the effectiveness of a treatment, and the facility's efforts, where possible, to remove, modify, or stabilize the risk factors a nd underlying causal factors. Care Plan For the resident at risk for developing or who has a pressure ulcer, determine if the facility developed an individualized care plan that addresses prevention, care and treatment of any existing pressure ulcers, including specific interventions, measurab le objectives and approximate time frames. If the facility's care of a specific resident refers to a treatment pr otocol that contains details of the treatment regimen, the care plan should refer to that protocol. The care plan should clarify any major deviations from, or revisions t o, that protocol in a specific resident. A specific care plan intervention for risk of pressu re ulcers is not needed if other components of the care plan address related ri sks adequately. For example, the risk of skin breakdown posed by fecal/urinary incontinence might be addressed in that part of the care plan that deals with incontinence management. If the resident refuses or resists staff interven tions to reduce risk or treat existing pressure ulcers, determine if the care plan reflects effort s to seek alternatives to address the needs identified in the assessment. Revision of the Care Plan Determine if the staff have been monitoring the resident's response to interventions for prevention and/or treatment and have evaluated a nd revised the care plan based on the resident's Revised September 2007 Page 5 response, outcomes, and needs. Review the reco rd and interview staff for information and/or evidence that: Continuing the current approaches meets th e resident's needs, if the resident has experienced recurring pressure ulcers or lack of progression toward healing and staff did not revise the care plan; and The care plan was revised to modify the prevention strategies and to address the presence and treatment of a newly develope d pressure ulcer, for the resident who acquired a new ulcer. 4. Interviews with Health Care Practitioners and Professionals If the interventions defined or care provi ded appear not to be consistent with recognized standards of practice, intervie w one or more health care practitioners and professionals as necessary (e.g., physic ian, charge nurse, di rector of nursing) who, by virtue of training and knowledge of the resident, should be able to provide information about the causes, trea tment and evaluation of the resident's condition or problem. Dependi ng on the issue, ask about: How it was determined that chosen interventions were appropriate; Risks identified for which there were no interventions; Changes in condition that may justify a dditional or different interventions; or How they validated the effectiveness of current interventions. If the attending physician is unavailable, interview the medical director, as appropriate. DETERMINATION OF COMPLIANCE (Task 6, Appendix P) Synopsis of Regulation (F314) The pressure ulcer requirement has two aspects. The first aspect requires the facility to prevent the development of pressure ulcer(s) in a resident who is admitted without pressure ulcer(s), un less the development is clinically unavoidable. The second aspect requires the facility to provide necessary treatment and services to promote hea ling, prevent infection and prevent new ulcers from developing. A facility may have noncompliance in either or both aspects of this requirement. Criteria for Compliance Compliance with 42 CFR 483.25(c)(1), F314, Pressure Sore o For a resident who developed a pressure ulcer after admission, th e facility is in compliance with this requirement, if staff have: Recognized and assessed factors placing th e resident at risk for developing a pressure ulcer, including specific cond itions, causes and/or problems, needs and behaviors; Defined and implemented interventions for pressure ulcer prevention in accordance with resident needs, goals a nd recognized standards of practice; Monitored and evaluated the resident's response to preventive efforts; and Revised the approaches as appropriate. If not, the development of the pressure ulcer is avoidable, cite at F314. Compliance with 42 CFR 483.25(c)(2), F314, Pressure Sore o For a resident who was admitted with a pressure ulcer, who has a pressure ulcer that is not healing, or who is at risk of deve loping subsequent pressure ulcers, the facility is in complian ce with this requirement if they: Revised September 2007 Page 6 Recognized and assessed factors placing the resident at risk of developing a new pressure ulcer or experiencing non-healing or delayed healing of a current pressure ulcer, including specific cond itions, causes and/or problems, needs and behaviors; Defined and implemented interventions for pressure ulcer prevention and treatment in accordance with resident need s, goals and recognized standards of practice; Addressed the potentia l for infection; Monitored and evaluated the resident's response to preventive efforts and treatment interventions; and Revised the approaches as appropriate. If not, cite at F314. Non-compliance for F314 After completing the Investigative Protocol, analyze the data in order to determine whether or not noncompliance with the regulation exists. Non-compliance for F314 may include (but is not limite d to) one or more of the following, including failure to: Accurately or consistently assess a resident's skin integrity on admission and as indicated thereafter; Identify a resident at risk of developing a pressure ulcer(s); Identify and address risk factors for devel oping a pressure ulcer, or explain adequately why they could not or should not do so; Implement preventive interventions in accord with the resident's need and current standards of practice; Provide clinical justifica tion for the unavoidable development or non-healing/delayed healing or deteriorati on of a pressure ulcer; Provide appropriate interventi ons, care and treatment to an existing pressure ulcer to minimize infections and to promote healing; Implement interventions for existing wounds; Notify the physician of the resident's conditi on or changes in the resident's wound(s); Adequately implement pertinent infection ma nagement practices in relation to wound care; and Identify or know how to apply relevant pol icies and procedures for pressure ulcer prevention and treatment. Potential Tags for Additional Investigation During the investigation of F314, the surveyor may have determined that concerns may also be present with related outcome, pr ocess and/or structure requirements. The surveyor is cautioned to i nvestigate these related requi rements before determining whether non-compliance may be present. Some examples of related requirements that should be considered include the following: 42 CFR 483.10(b)(11)(i)(B)&(C), F157, Notification of Changes o Determine if staff notified the physician of significant changes in the resident's condition or failure of the treatment plan to prevent or heal pressure ulcers; or the resident's representative (if known) of significant changes in the resident's condition in relation to the development of a pressure ulcer or a change in the progression of healing of an existing pressure ulcer. 42 CFR 483.20(b)(1), F272, Co mprehensive Assessments Revised September 2007 Page 7 o Determine if the facility comprehensivel y assessed the resident's skin condition, including existing pressure ulce rs, and resident-specific risk factors (including potential causative factors) for the development of a pressure ulcer or non-healing of the ulcer. 42 CFR 483.20(k)(1), F279, Co mprehensive Care Plans o Determine if the facility developed a care plan that was consistent with the resident's specific conditions , risks, needs, behaviors, and preferences and current standards of practice and included measur able objectives and timetables, specific interventions/services to prevent the devel opment of pressure ulcers and/or to treat existing pressures ulcers. 42 CFR 483.20(k)(2)(iii), F280, Comp rehensive Care Plan Revision o Determine if the care plan was periodically reviewed and revised as necessary to prevent the development of pressure ulcer s and to promote the healing of existing pressure ulcers. 42 CFR 483.20(k)(3)(i), F281, Services Pr ovided Meet Professional Standards o Determine if pressure ulcer care was provided in accordance with accepted professional standards. 42 CFR 483.25, F309, Quality of Care o Determine if staff identified and implemented appropriate measures for the management of pain as indicated as rela ted to pressure ulcer s and pressure ulcer treatment. 42 CFR 482.30(a), F353, Sufficient Staff o Determine if the facility had qualified staff in sufficient numbers to assure the resident was provided necessary care and services, based upon the comprehensive assessment and care plan, to prevent or treat pressure ulcers. 42 CFR 483.40(a)(1), F385, Physician Supervision o Determine if the physician has assessed and de veloped a treatment regimen relevant to preventing or healing a pressure ulcer and responded appropriately to the notice of changes in condition. 42 CFR 483.75(i)(2), F501, Medical Director o Determine whether the medical director assi sted the facility in the development and implementation of policies and procedures for pressure ulcer prevention and treatment, and that these are based on current standa rds of practice; and whether the medical director interacts with the phys ician supervising the care of the resident if requested by the facility to intervene on behalf of the resident with a pressure ulcer(s). V. DEFICIENCY CATEGORIZATI ON (Part V, Appendix P) Once the team has completed its investigation, analyzed the data, reviewed the regulatory requirement, and identified the deficient practices that demonstrate that the facility failed to provide care and treatment to prevent or treat pr essure ulcers and that non-compliance exists, the team must determine the severity of the deficien t practice(s) and the resu ltant harm or potential for harm to the resident. The key elements for severity determination for F314 are as follows: 1. Presence of harm/negative outcome(s) or potential for negative outcomes because of lack of appropriate treatment and care. Actual or potential harm/negative outcome for F314 may include but is not limited to: Potential for development of, occurrence or recurrence of (an) avoidable pressure ulcer(s); Complications such as sepsis or pain related to the presence of avoidable pressure ulcer(s); and/or Revised September 2007 Page 8 Pressure ulcers that fail to improve as an ticipated or develop complications such as sepsis or pain because of the l ack of appropriate treatment and care. 2. Degree of harm (actual or potential) related to the non-compliance Identify how the facility practices cause d, resulted in, allowed or contributed to the actual or potential for harm: If harm has occurred, determine if the ha rm is at the level of serious injury, impairment, death, compromise or discomfort; and If harm has not yet occurred, determine how likely is the potential for serious injury, impairment, death, compromise or discomfort to occur to the resident. 3. The immediacy of correction required Determine whether the non-compliance requir es immediate correction in order to prevent serious injury, harm, impairment , or death to one or more residents. The survey team must evaluate the harm or pot ential for harm based upon the following levels of severity for tag F314. First, the team must rule out whether Severi ty Level 4, Immediate Jeopardy to a resident's health or safety exists by evaluating the deficient practice in relation to immediacy, culpability and severity. (Follow the guidance in Appendix Q.) Severity Level 4 Considerations: Immediate Jeopardy to Resident Health or Safety Immediate Jeopardy is a situation in which the facility's non-compliance: With one or more requirements of participation has caused/resulted in, or is likely to cause, serious injury, harm, im pairment or death to a resident; and Requires immediate correction as the facil ity either created the situation or allowed the situation to continue by failing to implement preventative or corrective measures. Examples of possible avoidable negative outcomes may include: Development of avoidable Stage IV pre ssure ulcer(s): As a result of the facility's non- compliance, permanent tissue damage (whether or not healing occurs) has compromised the resident, increasing the potential for serious complications including osteomyelitits and sepsis. Admitted with a Stage IV pressure ulcer(s) that has shown no signs of healing or shows signs of deterioration: As a result of the facility's non-compliance, a Stage IV pressure ulcer has shown signs of dete rioration or a failure to progress towards healing with an increased potential for serious complications including osteomyelitis and sepsis. Stage III or IV pressure ulcers with associated soft tissue or systemic infection: As a result of the facility's failure to assess or treat a resident with an infectious complication of a pressure ulcer. (See di scussion in guidelines and definitions that distinguishes colonizat ion from infection.) Extensive failure in multiple areas of pr essure ulcer care: As a result of the facility's extensive noncompliance in multiple areas of pressure ulcer care, the resident developed recurrent and/or multiple, avoidable Stage III or Stage IV pressure ulcer(s). NOTE: If immediate jeopardy has been ruled out based upon the evidence, then evaluate whether actual harm that is not immedi ate jeopardy exists at Severity Level 3. Severity Level 3 Considerations: Actual Harm that is not Immediate Jeopardy Revised September 2007 Page 9 Revised September 2007 Page 10 Level 3 indicates noncompliance that results in actual harm, and can include but may not be limited to clinical compromise, decline, or the resi dent's ability to maintain and/or reach his/her highest practicable well-being. Examples of avoidable negative outcome s may include but are not limited to: The development of avoidable Stage III pressure ulcer(s): As a result of the facility's non-compliance, Stage III pr essure ulcers occurred, which are open wounds in which damage has occurred into the subcutaneous level and may be painful. The development of recurrent or multiple avoidable Stage II pressure ulcer(s): As a result of the facility's non- compliance, the resident developed multiple and/or recurrent avoidable Stage II ulcers. Failure to implement the comprehensive care plan for a resident who has a pressure ulcer : As a result of a facility's failure to implement a portion of an existing plan related to pressure ulcer care , such as failure to provide for pressure redistribution, or inappropriate treatment/dressing changes, a wound increased in size or failed to progress towards hea ling as anticipated, or the resident experienced untreated pain. NOTE: If Severity Level 3 (actual harm that is not immediate jeopardy) has been ruled out based upon the evidence, then evaluate as to whet her Level 2 (no actual harm with the potential for more than minimal harm) exists. Severity Level 2 Considerations: No Actu al Harm with Potential for More Than Minimal Harm that is Not Immediate Jeopardy Level 2 indicates noncompliance that results in a resident outcome of no more than minimal discomfort and/or has the potential to compromise the resident's ability to maintain or reach his or her highest practicable level of well being. The potential exists for greater harm to occur if interventions are not provided. Examples of avoidable negative outcome s may include but are not limited to: The development of a single avoidab le Stage II pressure ulcer that is receiving appropriate treatment: As a result of the facility's non-compliance, a resident developed an avoidable Stage II pressure ulcer. The development of an avoidable Stage I pressure ulcer : As a result of the facility's non-compliance, a resident de veloped an avoidable Stage I pressure ulcer. Failure to implement an element of the care plan for a resident who has a pressure ulcer however, there has been no evidence of decline or failure to heal. Failure to recognize or address the po tential for developing a pressure ulcer: As a result of the fac ility's non-compliance, staff failed to identify the risks, develop a plan of care and/or cons istently implement a plan that has been developed to prevent pressure ulcers. Severity Level 1: No Actual Harm with Potential for Minimal Harm The failure of the facility to provide appropriate care and services to prevent pressure ulcers or heal existing pressure ulcers is more than minimal harm. Therefore, Severity Level 1 doesn't apply for this regulatory requirement. SELF SURVEY ssment, the facility must ensure that -- \u00a7483.25(d) (1) A resident who enters the facility without an indwelling catheter is not catheterized unless the resident's clinical cond ition demonstrates that catheterization was necessary; and \u00a7483.25(d) (2 ) A resident who is incontinent of bla dder receives appropriate treatment and services to prevent urinary tract infections a nd to restore as much normal bladder function as possible. INTENT: (F315) 42 CFR 483.25 (d) (1) and (2) Urinary Incontinence and Catheters The intent of this requirement is to ensure that: Each resident who is incontinent of ur ine is identified, assessed and provided appropriate treatment and services to achie ve or maintain as much normal urinary function as possible; An indwelling catheter is not used unless there is valid medical justification; An indwelling catheter for which continui ng use is not medically justified is discontinued as soon as clinically warranted; Services are provided to re store or improve normal bladder function to the extent possible, after the remova l of the catheter; and A resident, with or without a catheter, recei ves the appropriate care and services to prevent infections to the extent possible. DEFINITIONS Definitions are provided to clarify clinical terms related to evaluation and treatment of urinary incontinence and catheter use. \"Bacteremia\" is the presence of bacteria in the bloodstream. \"Bacteriuria\" is defined as the pres ence of bacteria in the urine. \"Urinary Incontinence\" is th e involuntary loss or leakage of urine. There are several types of urinary incontinence, and the individual resident may experience more than one type at a time. Some of the more common types include: o \"Functional Incontinence\" refers to loss of urine that occurs in residents whose urinary tract function is sufficiently in tact that they should be able to maintain continence, but who cannot remain continent because of external factors (e.g., inability to utilize the toilet facilities in time); o \"Mixed Incontinence\" is the combinat ion of stress incontinence and urge incontinence; o \"Overflow Incontinence\" is associated with leakage of small amounts of urine when the bladder has reached its maximum capacity and has become distended; o \"Stress Incontinence\" (outlet incompetence) is associated with impaired urethral closure (malfunction of the urethral sphincter) which al lows small amounts of urine leakage when intra-abdominal pressure on the bladder is increased by sneezing, coughing, laughing, lifting, standing from a sitting position, climbing stairs, etc.; Revised September 2007 Page 1 o \"Transient Incontinence\" refers to temporary episodes of urinary incontinence that are reversible once the cause(s) of the epis ode(s) is (are) identified and treated; and o \"Urge Incontinence\" (overactive bladder) is associated with detrusor muscle overactivity (excessive contraction of the smooth muscle in the wall of the urinary bladder resulting in a sudden, str ong urge (also known as urge ncy) to expel moderate to large amounts of urine befo re the bladder is full). \"Urinary Retention\" is the inability to completely empty the urinary bladder by micturition. \"Urinary Tract Infection\" (U TI) is a clinically detectab le condition associated with invasion by disease causing microorganisms of so me part of the urinarytract, including the urethra (urethritis), bladder (cystitis ), ureters (ureteritis ), and/or kidney (pyelonephritis). An infection of the urethra or bladder is classified as a lower tract UTI and infection involving the ur eter or kidney is classifi ed as an upper tract UTI. \"Urosepsis\" refers to the systemic inflamma tory response to infection (sepsis) that appears to originate from a urinary tract sour ce. It may present with symptoms such as fever, hypotension, reduced urine output, or acute change in mental status. INVESTIGATIVE PROTOCOL URINARY CONTINENCE AND CATHETERS Objectives To determine whether the initial insertion or continued use of an indwelling catheter is based upon clinical indication fo r use of a urinary catheter; To determine the adequacy of interventions to prevent, improve and/or manage urinary incontinence; and To determine whether appropriate treatment and services have been provided to prevent and/or treat UTIs. Use Use this protocol for a sampled resident w ith an indwelling urinary catheter or for a resident with urinary incontinence. Procedures Briefly review the assessment, care plan and or ders to identify facility interventions and to guide observations to be made. Staff are expected to assess a nd provide appropriate care from the day of admission, for residents w ith urinary incontinence or a condition that may contribute to incontinence or the pres ence of an indwelli ng urinary catheter (including newly admitted residents). Corroborate observations by interview and record review. NOTE: Criteria established in this protocol provid e general guidelines and best practices which should be considered when making a determinati on of compliance, and is not an exhaustive list of mandatory elements. 1. Observation Observe whether staff consistently implement ed care plan interventions across various shifts. During observations of the interven tions, note and/or follo w up on deviations from the care plan or from current standards of practice, as well as potential negative outcomes. Revised September 2007 Page 2 Observe whether staff make appropriate re sident accommodations consistent with the assessment, such as placing the call bell with in reach and responding to the call bell, in relation to meeting toileting n eeds; maintaining a clear path way and ready access to toilet facilities; providing (where indi cated) elevated toilet seats, grab bars, adequate lighting, and assistance needed to use devices su ch as urinals, bedpans and commodes. Observe whether assistance has been provided to try to prevent incontinence episodes, such as whether prompting, transfer, and/or stand-by assist to ambul ate were provided as required for toileting. For a resident who is on a program to restore co ntinence or is on a prompted void or scheduled toileting program, note: The frequency of breakthrough or transient incontinence; How staff respond to the incontinence episodes; and Whether care is provided in accord with standards of practice (including infection control practices) and with resp ect for the resident's dignity. For a resident who has been determined by clini cal assessment to be unable to participate in a program to restore continence or in a scheduled toileting program and who requires care due to incontinence of urine, observe: Whether the resident is on a schedul ed check and change program; and Whether staff check and change in a timely fashion. For a resident who has experienced an incontinent episode, observe: The condition of the pads/sheets/clothing (a delay in providing c ontinence care may be indicated by brown rings/circles, satu rated linens/clothi ng, odors, etc.); The resident's in integrity, maceration, erythema, erosion); The resident's psychosocial outcomes (such as embarrassment or expressions of humiliation, resignation, about being incontinent); Whether staff implemented appropriate hyg iene measures (e.g., cleansing, rinsing, drying and applying protective moisture barriers or barrier films as indicated) to try to prevent skin breakdown from prolonged e xposure of the skin to urine; and Whether the staff response to incontinence episodes and the provision of care are consistent with standards of practice (including infection control practices) and with respect for the resident's dignity. For a resident with an indwelling catheter , observe the delivery of care to evaluate: Whether staff use appropriate infection control practices regarding hand washing, catheter care, tubing, and the collection bag; Whether staff recognize and assess potential evidence of symptomatic UTI or other related changes in urine condition (such as onset of bloody urine, cloudiness, or oliguria, if present); How staff manage and assess ur inary leakage from the point of catheter insertion to the bag, if present; If the resident has catheter-related pai n, how staff assess and manage the pain; and What interventions (such as anchoring the catheter, avoiding excessive tugging on the catheter during transfer and care delivery) are being used to prevent inadvertent catheter removal or tissue injury from dislodging the catheter. For a resident experiencing incontinence and who has an indwelling or intermittent catheter, observe whether the resident is provided and en couraged to take enough fluids to meet the Revised September 2007 Page 3 resident's hydration needs, as reflected in various measures of hydration status (approximately 30ml/kg/day or as indicated based on the resident's clinical condition). For issues regarding hydration, see Guidance at 42 CFR 483.25(j), F327. 2. Interviews Interview the resident, family or responsible party to the degree possible to identify: Their involvement in care plan developm ent including defining the approaches and goals, and whether interventions re flect preferences and choices; Their awareness of the existing continen ce program and how to use devices or equipment; If timely assistance is provided as needed for toileting needs, hydration and personal hygiene and if continence care and/or catheter care is provided according to the care plan; If the resident comprehends and applies inform ation and instructions to help improve or maintain continence (where cognition permits); Presence of urinary tract-related pa in, including causes and management; If interventions were refused, whether conseq uences and/or other alternative approaches were presented and discussed; and Awareness of any current UTI, history of UTIs, or perineal skin problems. If the resident has a skin problem that may be related to incontin ence, or staff are not following the resident's care plan and continence/catheter care program, interview the nursing assistants to determine if they: Are aware of, and understand, the interventions specific to th is resident (such as the bladder or bowel restorative/management programs); Have been trained and know how to handle catheters, tubing and drainage bags and other devices used during the provision of care; and Know what, when, and to whom to report chan ges in status regarding bowel and bladder function, hydration status, urine characteris tics, and complaints of urinary-related symptoms. 3. Record Review Assessment and Evaluation. Review the RAI, the hist ory and physical, and other nformation such as physician orders, progress notes, nurses' notes, pharmacist reports, lab reports and any flow sheets or forms the facility uses to document the resident's voiding history, including the assessment of th e resident's overall condition, risk factors and information about the resident's contin ence status, rationale for using a catheter, environmental factors related to continence programs, and the resident's responses to catheter/continence services. Request staff a ssistance, if the information is not readily available. Determine if the facility assessm ent is consistent with or co rroborated by documentation within the record and comprehensively reflect s the status of the resident for: Patterns of incontinent episodes, da ily voiding patterns or prior routines; Fluid intake and hydration status; Risks or conditions that may affect urinary continence; Use of medications that may affect con tinence and impaired continence that could reflect adverse drug reactions; Type of incontinence (stress, urge, ove rflow, mixed, functio nal, or transient incontinence) and contributing factors; Revised September 2007 Page 4 Environmental factors that might facilitate or impede the ability to maintain bladder continence, such as access to the toilet, call bell, type of clothing and/or continence products, ambulation devices (walkers, canes), use of restraints, side rails; Type and frequency of physical assistan ce necessary to fac ilitate toileting; Clinical rationale for use of an indwelling catheter; Alternatives to extended use of an indwelling catheter (if possible); and Evaluation of factors possibly contributing to chronically recurring or persistent UTIs. Care Plan. If the care plan refers to a sp ecific facility treatment protocol that contains details of the reatment regimen, the protocol must be available to the direct care staff, so that they may be familiar with it and use it. The care plan should clarify any significant deviations from such a protocol for a specific resident. If car e plan interventions that address aspects of continence and skin care related to incontinen ce are integrated within the overall care plan, the interventions do not need to be re peated in a separate continence care plan. Review the care plan to determine if the plan is based upon the goals, needs and strengths specific to the resident and reflects the comp rehensive assessment. Determine if the plan: Identifies quantifiable, measurable objectives with time frames to be able to assess whether the objectives have been met; Identifies interventions specific enough to gui de the provision of se rvices and treatment (e.g., toilet within an ho ur prior to each meal and within 30 minutes after meals, or check for episodes of incontinence within 30 minutes after each meal or specific times based upon the assessment of voiding patterns); Is based upon resident c hoices and preferences; Promotes maintenance of resident dignity; Addresses potential psychosocia l complications of incontinence or catheterization such as social withdrawal, embarrassment, humiliation, isolation, resignation; Includes a component to inform the reside nt and representative about the risks and benefits of catheter use, on continence ma nagement approaches, medications selected, etc.; Addresses measures to promote sufficient fl uid intake, including alternatives such as food substitutes that have a high liquid c ontent, if there is reduced fluid intake; Defines interventions to prevent skin br eakdown from prolonged exposure to urine and stool; Identifies and addresses the potential imp act on continence of medication and urinary ract stimulants or irritants (e.g., caffeine) in foods and beverages; Identifies approaches to minimize risk of infection (personal hygiene measures and catheter/tubing/bag care); and Defines environmental approaches and devi ces needed to promote independence in toileting, to maintain continence, an d to maximize independent functioning. For the resident who is not on a scheduled toileting program or a program to restore normal bladder function to the extent possi ble, determine if the care plan provides specific approaches for a check and change program. For the resident who is on a scheduled toil eting or restorative program (e.g., retraining, habit training, scheduled voiding, prompted voiding, toileting devices), determine whether the care plan: Revised September 2007 Page 5 Identifies the type of urinary incontinen ce and bases the program on the resident's voiding/elimination patterns; and Has been developed by considering the resi dent's medical/health condition, cognitive and functional ability to participate in a relevant continence program, and needed assistance. For the resident with a catheter, determine whether the care plan: Defines the catheter, tubing and bag care, including indications, a ccording to facility protocol, for changing the catheter, tubing or bag; Provides for assessment and removal of the indwelling catheter when no longer needed; and Establishes interventions to minimize cat heter-related injury, pain, encrustation, excessive urethral tension, accidental removal, or obstruction of urine outflow. Care Plan Revision. Determine if the resident's condition and effec tiveness of the care plan interventions have been monitored and care plan revisions were made (or justificati ons for continuing the existing plan) based upon the following: The outcome and/or effects of goals and interventions; A decline or lack of improvement in continence status; Complications associated with catheter usage; Resident failure to comply with a continen ce program and alternative approaches that were offered to try to maintain or improve continence, including c ounseling regarding the potential consequences of not following the program; Change in condition, ability to make d ecisions, cognition, medications, behavioral symptoms or visual problems; Input by the resident and/or the responsible person; and An evaluation of the resident's level of participation in, a nd response to, the continence program. 4. Interviews with Health Care Practitioners and Professionals If inconsistencies in care or potential negativ e outcomes have been identified, or care is not in accord with standards of practice, in terview the nurse respons ible for coordinating or overseeing the resident's care. Determine: How the staff monitor implementation of th e care plan, changes in continence, skin condition, and the status of UTIs; If the resident resists toileting, how staff have been taught to respond; Types of interventions that have been at tempted to promote continence (i.e., special clothing, devices, types and fr equency of assistance, cha nge in toileting schedule, environmental modifications); If the resident is not on a restorative program, how it was de termined that the resident could not benefit from interventions such as a scheduled toileting program; For the resident on a program of toileting, wh ether the nursing staff can identify the programming applicable to the resident, and: o The type of incontinence; o The interventions to address that specific type; o How it is determined that the schedule and program is effective (i.e., how continence is maintained or if there has been a dec line or improvement in continence, how the program is revised to ad dress the changes); and Revised September 2007 Page 6 o Whether the resident has any physical or c ognitive limitations that influence potential improvement of his/her continence; For residents with urinary cathet ers, whether the nursing staff: o Can provide appropriate justification for the use of the catheter; o Can identify previous attempts made (and the results of the attempts) to remove a catheter; and o Can identify a history of UTIs (if present), and interventions to try to prevent recurrence. If the interventions defined or care provided do not appear to be consistent with recognized standards of practice, interview one or more health care practitioners and professionals as necessary (e.g., physician, charge nu rse, director of nursing) w ho, by virtue of training and knowledge of the resident, should be able to provide information about the causes, treatment and evaluation of the resident's condition or problem. Depending on the issue, ask about: How it was determined that the chosen interventions were appropriate; Risks identified for which there were no interventions; Changes in condition that may justify additiona l or different interventions; or how they validated the effectiveness of current interventions; and How they monitor the approaches to con tinence programs (e.g., policies/procedures, staffing requirements, how staff identify pr oblems, assess the toile ting pattern of the resident, develop and implement continence-r elated action plans, how staff monitor and evaluate resident's responses, etc.). If the attending physician is unavailable, interview the medical director, as appropriate. DETERMINATION OF COMPLIANCE (Task 6, Appendix P) Synopsis of regulation (F315) The urinary incontinence requireme nt has three aspects. The first aspect requires that a resident who does not have an indwelling ur inary catheter does not have one inserted unless the resident's clinical condition demonstrates th at it was necessary. The second as pect requires the facility to provide appropriate treatment and se rvices to prevent urinary tract infections; and the third is that the facility attempt to assist the resident to re store as much normal bladder function as possible. Criteria for Compliance Compliance with 42 CFR 483.25(d)(1) and (2), F315, Urinary Incontinence o For a resident who was admitted with an indwelling urinary catheter or who had one placed after admission, the facility is in compliance with this requirement, if staff have: - Recognized and assessed factors affecti ng the resident's urinary function and identified the medical justification for th e use of an indwelli ng urinary catheter; - Defined and implemented pertinent interven tions to try to minimize complications from an indwelling urinary catheter, and to re move it if clinically indicated, consistent with resident conditions, goals, and recognized standards of practice; - Monitored and evaluated the reside nt's response to interventions; and - Revised the approaches as appropriate. Revised September 2007 Page 7 If not, the use of an indwelli ng urinary catheter is not medical ly justified, and/or the ongoing treatment and services for cathete r care were not provided consiste nt with the resident's needs. Cite F315. o For a resident who is incontin ent of urine, the facility is in compliance with this requirement if they: - Recognized and assessed factors affecting the risk of symptomatic urinary tract infections and impair ed urinary function; - Defined and implemented interventions to address correctable underlying causes of urinary incontinence and to try to minimize the occurrence of symptomatic urinary tract infections in accordance with resident needs, goals, and recognized standards of practice; - Monitored and evaluated the resident's res ponse to preventive efforts and treatment interventions; and - Revised the approaches as appropriate. If not, the facility is not in comp liance with the requirement to assi st the resident to maintain or improve the continence status, and/ or prevent the declin e of the condition of urinary incontinence for the resident. Cite F315. o For a resident who has or has had a symptomatic urinary tract infection, the facility is in compliance with this requirement if they have: - Recognized and assessed factors affecting the risk of symptomatic urinary tract infections and impair ed urinary function; - Defined and implemented interventions to try to minimize the occurrence of symptomatic urinary tract infections and to address correctable underlying causes, in accordance with resident needs, goals, a nd recognized standards of practice; - Monitored and evaluated the resident's res ponses to preventive efforts and treatment interventions; and - Revised the approaches as appropriate. If not, the development of a symptomatic urinary tract infection, and/or de cline of the resident with one, was not consistent with the iden tified needs of the resident. Cite F315. Noncompliance for F315 After completing the Investigative Protocol, analyze the data in order to determine whether or not noncompliance with the regul ation exists. Noncompliance for F315 may include (but is not limite d to) one or more of the following, including failure to: Provide care and treatment to prevent inco ntinence and/or improve urinary continence and restore as much normal bl adder function as possible; Provide medical justification fo r the use of a catheter or provide services for a resident with a urinary catheter; Assess, prevent (to the extent possible) and treat a symptomatic urinary tract infection (as indicated by the resident's choices, clin ical condition and physic ian treatment plan); Accurately or consistently assess a resident's continence status on admission and as indicated thereafter; Identify and address risk factors for developing urinary incontinence; Implement interventions (such as bladder rehabilitative programs) to tr y to improve bladder function Revised September 2007 Page 8 or prevent urinary incontinence, consistent with the resident's assessed need and current standards of practice; Provide clinical justificati on for developing urinary incontinence or for the failure of existing urinary incontinence to improve; Identify and manage symptomatic urinary tr act infections, or e xplain adequately why they could or should not do so; Implement approaches to manage an indwel ling urinary catheter based upon standards of practice, including inf ection control procedures; Identify and apply relevant policies and pr ocedures to manage urinary incontinence, urinary catheters and/or urinary tract infections; Notify the physician of the resident's condition or changes in the resident's continence status or development of symptoms that may represent a symptomatic UTI (in contrast to asymptomatic bacteriuria). Potential Tags for Additional Investigation During the investigation of 42 CFR 483.25(d)(1) a nd (2), the surveyor may have identified concerns related to outcome, process and/or structure require ments. The surveyor should investigate these requirements before determin ing whether noncompliance may be present. The following are examples of related outcome, process and/or structure requirements that should be considered: 42 CFR 483.10(b)(11), F157, No tification of Changes o Determine if staff notified the physician of significant changes in the resident's continence, catheter usage, or the development, treatment an d/or change in symptomatic UTIs; or notified the resident or resident's representative (whe re one exists) of significant changes as noted above. 42 CFR 483.15(a), F241, Dignity o Determine if staff provide continence care an d/or catheter care to the resident in a manner that respects his/her dignity, strives to meet needs in a timely manner, monitors and helps the resident who cannot request assi stance, and strives to minimize feelings of embarrassment, humiliation and/or isolation related to impaired continence. 42 CFR 483.20(b)(1), F272, Co mprehensive Assessments o Determine if the facility comprehensively a ssessed the resident's continence status and resident-specific risk factor s (including potential causes), and assessed for the use of continence-related devices, including an indwelling catheter. 42 CFR 483.20(k), F279, Comp rehensive Care Plans o Determine if the facility developed a care plan (1) that was consistent with the resident's specific conditions, risks, needs, behaviors, and preferences and with current standards of practice and (2) that includes measurable objectives, approximate timetables, specific interventions and/or se rvices needed to prevent or address incontinence, provide catheter care; and to prevent UTIs to the extent possible. 42 CFR 483.20(k)(2)(iii), F280, Comp rehensive Care Plan Revision o Determine if the care plan was reviewed a nd revised periodically, as necessary, related to preventing, managing, or improving incont inence, managing an indwelling urinary Revised September 2007 Page 9 catheter, possible discontinuation of an indwel ling catheter, and attempted prevention and management of UTIs. 42 CFR 483.20(k)(3)(i), F281, Services Provided Meet Professional Standards o Determine if services and care were provide d for urinary incontin ence, catheter care and/or symptomatic UTIs in accordance with accepted professional standards. 42 CFR 483.25, F309, Quality of Care o Determine if staff identified and implemented appropriate measures to address any pain related to the use of an indwelling urinary catheter or skin complications such as maceration, and to provide the necessary ca re and services in accordance with the comprehensive assessment plan of care. 42 CFR 483.25 (a)(3) F312, Quality of Care o Determine if staff identified and implemented appropriate measures to provide good personal hygiene for the resident who cannot perform relevant activ ities of daily living, and who has been assessed as unable to achie ve and/or restore normal bladder function. 42 CFR 483.40(a), F385, Physician Supervision o Determine if the physician has evaluated a nd addressed, as indica ted, medical issues related to preventing or managing urinary inc ontinence, catheter usage, F444, Infec tion Control: Hand Washing o Determine if staff wash their hands after providing incontinence care, and before and after providing catheter care. 42 CFR 483.75(f), F498, Proficiency of Nurse Aides o Determine if nurse aides correctly deliver continence and catheter care, including practices to try to minimize skin brea kdown, UTIs, catheter-related injuries, and dislodgement. 42 CFR 483.30(a), F353, Sufficient Staff o Determine if the facility had qualified staff in sufficient numbers to provide necessary care and services on a 24-hour basis, base d upon the comprehensive assessment and care plan, to prevent, manage and/or impr ove urinary incontinence where possible. 42 CFR 483.75(i)(2), F501, Medical Director o Determine whether the medical director, in co llaboration with the facility and based on current standards of practice, has develope d policies and procedures for the prevention and management of urinary incontinence, for catheter care, and for the identification and management of symptomatic ur inary tract infections; and wh ether the medical director interacts, if requested by the facility, with the physician supervising the care of the resident related to the management of urinar y incontinence, catheter or infection issues. Revised September 2007 Page 10 V. DEFICIENCY CATEGORIZATION (Part V, Appendix P) Once the team has completed its investigation, analyzed the data, reviewed the regulatory requirements, and determined that non-compliance exists, the team must determine the severity of each deficiency, based on the resultant effect or potential for harm to the resident. The key elements for severity determination for F315 are as follows: 1. Presence of harm/negative outcome(s) or potential for negative outcomes because of lack of appropriate treatment and care. Actual or potential harm/negative outcome for F315 may include, but is not limited to: Development, recurrence, persistence, or increasing frequency of urinary incontinence, which is not the result of underlying clinical conditions; Complications such as uros epsis or urethral injury related to the presence of an indwelling urinar y catheter that is not clinically justified; Significant changes in psychosocial functioning, such as isolation, withdrawal, or embarrassment, relate d to the presence of un-assessed or unmanaged urinary incontinence and/or a decline in contin ence, and/or the use of a urinary catheter without a cl inically valid medical justification; and Complications such as skin breakdow n that are related to the failure to manage urinary incontinence; 2. Degree of harm (actual or potential) relate d to the noncompliance. Identify how the facility practices caused, resulted in, allowed or contributed to the actual or potential for harm: If harm has occurred, determine if th e harm is at the level of serious injury, impairment, death, compromise, or discomfort; and If harm has not yet occurred, determine the potential for serious injury, impairment, death, or compromise or di scomfort to occur to the resident; and 3. The immediacy of correction require d. Determine whether the noncompliance requires immediate correction in orde r to prevent serious injury, harm, impairment, or death to one or more residents. The survey team must evaluate the harm or pot ential for harm based upon the following levels of severity for tag F315. First, the team must rule out whether Severi ty Level 4, Immediate Jeopardy to a resident's health or safety exists by evaluating the deficient practice in relation to immediacy, culpability, and severity. (Follow the guidance in Appe ndix Q, Immediate Jeopardy.) Severity Level 4 Considerations: Immediate Jeopardy to Resident Health or Safety Immediate Jeopardy is a situation in which th e facility's noncomplian ce with one or more requirements of participation: Has allowed/caused/resulted in, or is likely to allow/cause /result in serious injury, harm, impairment, or death to a resident; and Requires immediate correction, as the facility either created the situation or allowed the situation to continue by failing to implem ent preventative or corrective measures. Revised September 2007 Page 11 Examples of possible negative outcomes as a re sult of the facility's deficient practices may include: Complications resulting from utilization of urinary appliance(s) without medical justification: As a result of incorrect or unwarrant ed (i.e., not medically indicated) utilization of a urinary catheter, pessary, etc ., the resident experiences injury or trauma (e.g., urethral tear) that requires surgical interven tion or repair. Extensive failure in multiple areas of incontinence care and/or catheter management: As a result of the facility's noncompliance in multiple areas of continence care or catheter management, the resident developed urosepsis with complications leading to prolonged decline or death. NOTE: If immediate jeopardy has been ruled out based upon the evidence, then evaluate whether actual harm that is not immedi ate jeopardy exists at Severity Level 3. Severity Level 3 Considerations: Actual Harm that is not Immediate Jeopardy Level 3 indicates noncompliance that results in actual harm, and can include but may not be limited to clinical compromise, decline, or the resident's ability to maintain and/or reach his/her highest practicable well-being. Examples of avoidable negative outcome s may include, but are not limited to: The development of a symptomatic UTI: As a result of the fac ility's noncompliance, the resident developed a symptomatic UTI, without long term complications, associated with the use of an indwelli ng catheter for which there was no medical justification. The failure to identify, assess and mange urinary retention: As a result of the facility's noncompliance, the resident ha d persistent overflow incontinence and/or developed recurrent symptomatic UTIs. The failure to provide appropriate catheter care: As a result of the facility's noncompliance, the catheter was improperly managed, resulting in catheterrelated pain, bleeding, urethral tears or urethral erosion. Medically unjustified use of an indw elling catheter with complications: As a result of the facility's noncompliance, a resident who was admitted with a urinary catheter had the catheter remain for an extended period of time without a valid medical justification for its continued use, or a urinary catheter was inserted after the resident was in the facility and used for an ex tended time without medical ju stification, during which the resident experienced significant complications such as recurrent symptomatic UTIs. Decline or failure to improve continence status: As a result of the facility's failure to assess and/or re-assess the resident's continence status, utilize sufficient staffing to implement continence programs and provide other related services based on the resident's assessed needs, and/ or to evaluate the possible a dverse effects of medications on continence status, the resident failed to maintain or improve continence status. Complications due to urinary incontinence: As a result of the facility's failure to provide care and services to a resident who is incontinent of urin e, in accordance with resident need and accepted standards of practic e, the resident developed skin maceration and/or erosion or declined to attend or participate in social situations (withdrawal) due to embarrassment or humiliation related to unmanaged urinary incontinence. Revised September 2007 Page 12 Revised September 2007 Page 13 NOTE: If Severity Level 3 (actual harm that is not immediate jeopardy) has been ruled out based upon the evidence, then evaluate as to whet her Level 2 (no actual harm with the potential for more than minimal harm) exists. Severity Level 2 Considerations: No Actual Harm with potential for more than minimal harm that is Not Immediate Jeopardy Level 2 indicates noncompliance that results in a resident outcome of no more than minimal discomfort and/or has the potential to compromise the resident's ability to maintain or reach his or her highest practicab le level of well being. The potential exists for greater harm to occur if interventions are not provided. Examples of potentially avoidable negative outcomes may include, but are not limited to: Medically unjustified use of an indwelling catheter: As a result of the facility's noncompliance, the resident has the potential for experiencing complications, such as symptomatic UTIs, bladder stones, pain, etc. Complications associated with inadequate care and services for an indwelling catheter: As a result of the facil ity's noncompliance, the resident has developed potentially preventable non-life-threatening problems related to the catheter, such as leaking of urine due to blockage of urine out flow, with or without skin maceration and/or dermatitis. Potential for decline or complications: As a result of the facility's failure to consistently implement a scheduled voiding program defined in accordance with the assessed needs, the resident experiences rep eated episodes of inc ontinence but has not demonstrated a decline or developed complications. Severity Level 1: No actual harm with potential for minimal harm The failures of the facility to provide appropriate care and services to improve continence, manage indwelling catheters, and minimize negative outcome places residents at risk for more than minimal harm. Therefore, Sever ity Level 1 does not apply for this regulatory requirement. SELF SURVEY MODULE 483.25 (h) The facility must ensure that - (1) The resident environment remains as free from accident hazards as is possible; and (2) Each resident receives ad equate supervision and assistance devices to prevent accidents. INTENT: 42 CFR 483.25(H) (1) AND (2) ACCIDENTS AND SUPERVISION The intent of this requirement is to ensure the facility provides an environment that is free from accident hazards over which the facili ty has control and provides supervision and assistive devices to each resident to prev ent avoidable accidents. This includes: Identifying hazard(s) and risk(s); Evaluating and analyzing hazard(s) and risk(s); Implementing interventions to re duce hazard(s) and risk(s); and Monitoring for effectiveness and modi fying interventions when necessary. DEFINITIONS Definitions are provided to clarify terms related to providing supervision and other interventions to prevent accidents. \"Accident\" refers to any unexpected or uni ntentional incident, which may result in injury or illness to a resident. This does not include adverse outcomes that are a direct consequence of treatment or care that is provided in accordance with current standards of practice (e.g., drug side effects or reaction). o \"Avoidable Accident\" means that an acci dent occurred becau se the facility failed to: - Identify environmental hazards and individual resident risk of an accident, including the need for supervision; and/or - Evaluate/analyze the hazar ds and risks; and/or - Implement interventions, including adequate superv ision, consistent with a resident's needs, goals, plan of care, and current standards of practice in order to reduce the risk of an accident; and/or - Monitor the effectiveness of the interv entions and modify the interventions as necessary, in accordance with cu rrent standards of practice. o \"Unavoidable Accident\" means that an accident occurred despite facility efforts to: - Identify environmental hazards and individual resident risk of an accident, including the need fo r supervision; and - Evaluate/analyze the h azards and risks; and - Implement interventions, including adequate supervis ion, consistent with the resident's needs, goals, plan of care, and current standards of practice in order to reduce the risk of an accident; and Revised September 2007 Page 1 - Monitor the effectiveness of the interv entions and modify the interventions as necessary, in accordance with cu rrent standards of practice. \"Assistance Device\" or \"Assistive Device\" refe rs to any item (e.g., fixtures such as handrails, grab bars, and devi ces/equipment such as transfer lifts, canes, and wheelchairs, etc.) that is used by, or in th e care of a resident to promot e, supplement, or enhance the resident's function and/or safety. NOTE: The currently accepted nomenclature refers to \"assistive devices.\" Although the term \"assistance devices\" is used in the regulation, the Guidance provided in this document will refer to \"assistive devices.\" \"Environment\" refers to the resident environment. (See definition for \"resident environment.\") \"Fall\" refers to unintentionally coming to rest on the ground, floor, or other lower level, but not as a result of an overwhelming ex ternal force (e.g., resident pushes another resident). An episode where a resident lost his/her balance and would have fallen, if not for staff intervention, is considered a fall. A fa ll without injury is s till a fall. Unless there is evidence suggesting otherw ise, when a resident is found on the floor, a fall is considered to have occurred. 1 \"Hazards\" refer to elements of the resident e nvironment that have th e potential to cause injury or illness. o \"Hazards over which the facility has contro l\" are those hazards in the resident environment where reasonable efforts by the f acility could influence the risk for resulting injury or illness. o \"Free of accident hazards as is possible\" re fers to being free of accident hazards over which the facility has control. \"Resident environment\" incl udes the physical surroundings to which the resident has access (e.g., room, unit, common use areas , and facility grounds, etc.). \"Risk\" refers to any external factor or characteristic of an individual resident that influences the likelihood of an accident. \"Supervision/Adequate Supervision\" refers to an intervention and means of mitigating the risk of an accident. Faciliti es are obligated to provide adequate supervision to prevent accidents. Adequate supervision is defined by the type and frequency of supervision, based on the individual resident 's assessed needs and identified hazards in the resident environment. Adequate supervision may vary fr om resident to resident and from time to time for the same resident. INVESTIGATIVE PROTOCOL ACCIDENTS AND SUPERVISION Objectives To determine if the facility has identified ha zard(s) present in the resident environment and the individual resident's risks for an avoidable accident posed by those hazards; To determine if a resident acciden t was avoidable or unavoidable; To evaluate whether the facility provides an environment that is as free as possible of hazards over which the facil ity has control, and minimizes the potential for harm; and To determine if the facility provides adequa te supervision and assistive devices to prevent avoidable accidents. Revised September 2007 Page 2 Use Use this protocol: For a sampled resident who is at risk for, or who has a history of accidents, falls, or unsafe wandering/elopement, to determine if the facility provided care and services, including assistive devices as necessary, to prevent avoidable accidents and to reduce the resident's risk to the extent possible; For a sampled resident who is at risk for accidents or who creates a risk to others, to determine if the facility has provi ded adequate supervision; and For identified hazards/risks, to determine if there are f acility practices in place to identify, evaluate and analyze hazards/risks; implement interventions to reduce or eliminate the hazards/risks, to the extent po ssible; and monitor the effectiveness of the interventions. Procedures Observe the general environment and sampled re sident environment. For a sampled resident, briefly review the assessment and plan of care to determine whether the facility identified resident risks and implemented interventions as necessary to guide observations during the investigation. For a newly admitted resident at risk for avoidable accidents, determine if the staff assessed and provided appropriate care from the day of admission. Corroborate observations through interview and record review. 1. Observation The survey team should make observations and investigate potential hazards that may be encountered throughout the survey. The existenc e of hazards may indicate a more serious problem; for example, that the organization lacks an effective system to identify and correct the problem independently. The prev ious discussion of sp ecific common hazards guides surveyors to look for items indicating a failure or absence of an organization's systems and processes to enable safety. During observation of the facility, the survey te am may see individual residents who are smoking tobacco products. Whether or not these residents are part of the sample, the issue of facility fires is important enough that the survey team should de termine if the situati on is hazardous, requiring further investigation. Observe the environment for the presence of potential/actual hazards including, but not limited to, the following: Accessibility of chemicals, toxics or other hazards such as housekeeping chemicals and supplies, medications, sharp utensils/tools, and cigarette lighter s/smoking materials; Environmental conditions such as unstable or slippery floor surfaces, loose hand rails, excessive water temperatures, electrical hazard s, insufficient or excessive light (glare), arrangement of living spaces, obstacles in corr idors, unsupervised access into or egress out of the facility, low or loose toilet seats, defective or nonfunctioning beds, or malfunctioning wheelchair brakes; Staff responses to verbal calls for help and alarms such as door, personal, and equipment alarms, and call bells; Assistive devices/equipment (e.g., mobility devices , lifts and transfer aids, bed rails, call lights, physical restrain ts, pumps, belts) that are defectiv e; not used properly or according to manufacturer's specifications; disabled or removed; not provided or do not meet the resident's needs (poor fit or not adapted); an d/or used without ade quate supervision, in relation to the facility's assessment of the resident; and/or Staff response to potential/actual hazard(s) (e.g., cleaning up spilled li quids in a resident area, keeping residents away from the hazard). Revised September 2007 Page 3 For a sampled resident at risk, observe whethe r staff implement the care plan consistently over time and across various shifts. Observe how staff respond to any identified resident hazards. Observe how staff supervise the reside nt, such as during transfers and/or meals, and if caregivers have remove d or modified observed hazards. During observations of the interventions, follow up on deviations from the plan of care, as well as potential negative outcomes. For a resident who smokes, the facility's dete rmination regarding the resident's abilities and capabilities would indicate wh ether supervision is required. If the resident is found to need supervision for smoking, this information is included in the resident's plan of care. Observe sampled resident(s) in the facility 's designated smoking area. If the resident's care plan states supervision is required while smoking, confirm that supervision is provided. For others, note any concerns such as difficulty holding or lighting a cigarette or burned areas in clothing that may indicate the need for supervision. Observe the resident to determine how the resident's risk influences his/her vulnerability to the observed potential hazard(s) and potential for an accident. Evaluate how the resident's risks relate to the observed po tential hazards such as: The resident's access to the hazard and th e ability to react appropriately; and/or The adequacy of the supervision provided fo r the resident who has been assessed to need supervision in relation to the identified potential hazard(s). 2. Interview Conduct interviews to determine the relationshi p between the resident's risk and hazards. Interview the resident, family, and/or responsible party to the degree possible to identify: If the resident and/or responsible party repo rted, or helped identif y the resident's risks for an accident and significant hazards in the resident's environment; If the resident and/or responsible party was aware of or identified a potential hazard for other residents; If the resident and/or responsible party report ed a hazard or potential risk to staff; and How and when staff responded to a hazard on ce it was identified. Interview staff to determine: If they were aware of planned interventions to reduce a resident's risk for an avoidable accident; If they reported potential resident risks or environmental hazards to the supervisor or others according to facility policy; If they acted to correct an immediat e hazard, such as spilled liquids; and If they are aware of, and follow facility procedures correctly to remove or reduce hazards. 3. Record Review Assessment and Evaluation: Review the RA I and other documents such as progress notes, physician orders, and nurses' and consultants' notes regarding the assessment of the resident's overall condition and risk factors to determine if the facility identified the resident's risk for avoidable accidents, evaluated and anal yzed any risks, implemented interventions to try to prevent accidents a nd reduce the resident's risks, and monitored and modified interventions as necessary. Revised September 2007 Page 4 Determine if the facility assessment is cons istent with or corroborated by documentation within the record and reflects th e status of the resident for: Behavior such as unsafe wandering, elopeme nt, ingesting nonfood items, altercations with others; Hearing, visual, and sensory impairments; Impaired physical functioning, balance, or gait problems; Diagnoses that could relate to safety awareness and safe pr actices, such as Alzheimer's and other dementias, arthritis, Parkinson's disease, seizure disorder, osteoporosis, cardiovascular/cerebrovascular di seases, depression/psychosis; Symptoms/conditions that could affect sa such as vertigo, postural hypotension, or acute illness; Use of physical restraints and/or other devices that might limit movement; Medications that could affect function, level of consciousness, gait, balance, visual acuity, or cognitive ability, use such as antidepressants, anticholinergic medications, anti- hypertensives, diuretics, psychotropic medi cations, or initiation of new medication therapy; and History of falls. Plan of Care: Review the plan of care to de termine if the facility developed interventions based on the resident's risks to try to prevent avoidable acci dents, and if the plan was modified as needed based on the response, outcomes, and needs of the resident. If the resident has had an accident, review the record to determine if the accident is: The result of an order not being followed; and/or A care need not being addressed; and/or A plan of care not being implemented. In addition, determine if the facility (1) investigated the cause of the accident and (2) if indicated, implemented revised inte rventions to prevent additional avoidable accidents. Plan of Care Revision: Determine if the facility has monitored a resident's condition and the effectiveness of the plan of care interventions and has made revisions (or has documented justification for con tinuing the existing plan) based upon the following: The outcome and/or effects of goals and interventions; Resident failure to comply with the plan of care and interventions; Input by the resident and/or the responsible person; and Changes in condition such as the ability to make decisions, cognition, functional impairment, or changes in the medication regimen. 4. Review of Facility Practices The presence or absence of effective facili ty practices to provide a safe resident environment can influence the likelihood of an accident occurring and subsequent harm to a resident(s). Hazards that have been a llowed to exist for a long time, or a facility history of similar problems, could indicate inad equate or ineffective facility practices. If, during the tour, surveyors identify care deliver y, hazards or potential hazards, or a history of resident accidents, the survey team shoul d share the findings with the entire team and determine who will lead the investigation of the facil ity's systems for identifying, evaluating and preventing avoidable accidents or hazards. Review of facility practices Revised September 2007 Page 5 may involve a review of policies and proce dures, staffing, staff tr aining, and equipment manufacturer's information, as well as in terviews with staff and management. If there is a pattern of accidents involving one or mo re residents, determine how the facility evaluates its responses to the accidents. Determine if the facility ensured that the resident environment remained as free of accide nt hazards as possible and if each resident received adequate supervisi on and assistive devices to tr y to prevent accidents by: Identifying potential hazards and risks (may require various strategies to gather such information); Evaluating and analyzing the informati on gathered to identify the underlying causes of the hazard and/or risk; Implementing interventions that addresse d the causes and prioritized actions based on severity of the hazard and immediacy of the risk; and Monitoring implementation of interventi ons and determining if modification is needed. DETERMINATION OF COMPLIANCE (Task 6, Appendix P) Synopsis of Regulation The requirements at 42 CFR 483.25(h)(1) and (2) have three aspects. The first aspect requires that a resident's environment remains as free of accident hazards as possible; the second aspect requires that the facility provide adequate supervision; and the third is that the facility provides assistive devices to prevent accidents. Criteria for Compliance The facility's responsibility to accommodate individual needs and preferences and abide by the resident's right to choice and self-determination must be balanced against compliance with F323 to protect the resident. Document ation regarding the resident's c hoices will assist the survey team in making compliance decisions. NOTE: It is important to remember that not all acci dents in a facility, regardless of outcome to a resident, are necessarily due to facility noncompliance. A resident can sustain bodily injury as a result of an accident over which the facility ha d no control (i.e., an unavoidable accident). The survey team needs to review the situation that led to the injury or potential for injury, as well as the facility practices, and resident's rights, preferences, and choices , to determine if the potential or negative outcome was avoidable or unavoidable. Compliance with 42 CFR 483.25(h)(1) and (2), F323, Accidents and Supervision For the resident who has had an accident or was assessed at risk for an avoidable accident, the facility is in compliance with this requirement, if staff have: Identified hazards and risk of an avoidable accident based on the facility's assessment of the resident environment and the resident, including the need for supervis ion and/or assistive devices; Evaluated/analyzed the hazards and risks; Implemented interventions, including adequate supervision and/or assistive devices, to reduce the risks of an accident that were consis tent with a resident's needs, goals, plan of care, and current standards of practice; Provided assistive devices consiste nt with a resident's needs; Properly deployed and maintained resident specific equipment (e.g., lifts, canes, wheelchairs, walkers); Revised September 2007 Page 6 Provided a safe environment, such as by m onitoring chemicals, wet floors, cords and other equipment; Operated equipment in accordance with ma nufacturer's recommendations and resident need; Provided and maintain a secure environmen t (e.g., resident room, unit, common use areas, stairs and windows, facility grounds , etc.) to prevent negative outcomes (e.g., prevent falling/tumbling down stairs or jumping from windows or eloping through exit doors) for residents who exhibit unsafe wanderi ng and/or elopement behavior (regardless of whether ambulatory, in wheelchair or using walker); and Monitored the effectiveness of the interven tions and modified the interventions as necessary, in accordance with cu rrent standards of practice. If not, cite F323. Noncompliance for F323 After completing the investigation, determine wh ether or not compliance with the regulation exists. Noncompliance for F323 may include, but is not limited to, one or more of the following failures to: Provide each resident an e nvironment that is as free as possible from hazards over which the facility has contro l, such as assuring safe storage of toxic chemicals and medications, and safe use of equi pment and electrical appliances; Provide adequate supervision for a resident who has exhi bited unsafe wandering and/or has a risk of and/or a history of elopement; Identify and correct hazards such as non-f unctional alarms or call systems, disabled locks, fire doors that have been propped open, irregular walking surfaces, inadequate lighting or unsafe water temperatures; Supervise and monitor a resident who smokes and whose comprehensive assessment and plan of care indicates a need for supervision; Provide assistive devices and/ or appropriate training for th e use of assistive devices, based upon the assessed n eeds of the resident; Monitor for defective or disabled equipmen t, such as pumps, ventilators or other equipment, or the improper use of assistive devices; Assess, develop interventions, and/or revise the plan of care for a resident who has experienced falls, or who is identified as having risk factors for falling; and Assess, develop interventions, and/or revise the plan of care for a resident who has exhibited or has a risk for unsafe wandering or elopement. Potential Tags for Additional Investigation During the investigation of 42 CFR 483.25(h)(1) a nd (2), the surveyor may have identified concerns related to outcome, process, and/or structure requi rements. The surveyor should investigate these requirements before determin ing whether noncompliance may be present. The following are examples of related outcome, process, and/or structure requir ements that should be considered: 42 CFR 483.13(a), F221, Restraints o Determine if staff attempted alternative approaches prior to the use of a restraint and if a medical indication for its use is present. 42 CFR 483.13(b), F223, Abuse o Determine if the resident was free from verbal, sexual, physical, and mental abuse, corporal punishment, and involuntary seclusion. Revised September 2007 Page 7 42 CFR 483.20(b)(1), F272, Co mprehensive Assessments o Determine if the facility comprehensiv ely assessed reside nt-specific risk factors (including potential causes) and a ssessed the need for and use of assistive devices. 42 CFR 483.20(k)(1), F279, Co mprehensive Care Plans o Determine if the facility developed a plan of care based on the comprehensive resident assessment consistent with the re sident's specific conditions, risks, needs, behaviors, and preferences and with cu rrent standards of practice, and that includes measurable objectives and approxima te timetables, specific interventions and/or services including necessary s upervision and/or any assistive devices needed to prevent accidents to the extent possible. 42 CFR 483.20(k)(2), F280, Compre hensive Care Plan Revision o Determine if the plan of care was re viewed and revised periodically, as necessary, related to preventing accidents, supervision required, and the use of assistive devices. 42 CFR 483.20(k)(3)(i), F281, Services Pr ovided Meet Professional Standards o Determine if services and care were pr ovided for the use of assistive devices, supervision, and prevention of accidents in accordance with accepted professional standards. 42 CFR 483.30(a), F353, Sufficient Staff o Determine if the facility had qualified staff in sufficient numbers to provide necessary care and services , including supervision, based upon the comprehensive assessment and care plan, to prevent accidents, as possible. 42 CFR 483.75(o), F520, Quality Assessment and Assurance o Determine whether the quality asse ssment and assurance committee has identified issues, and developed and impl emented appropriate plans of action to correct identified quality deficiencies in relation to hazards, accident prevention, and supervision of residents. V. DEFICIENCY CATEGORIZATION (Part V, Appendix P) Once the survey team has completed its investigat ion, analyzed the data, reviewed the regulatory requirements, and determined that noncompliance ex ists, the team must dete rmine the severity of each deficiency, based on the resultant effect or potential for harm to the resident. The key elements for severity determination for F323 are as follows: 1. Presence of harm/negative outcome(s) or potential for negative outcomes because of presence of environmental hazards, lack of adequate supervision to prevent accidents, or failure to provide assistive devices to prevent accidents. Actual or potential harm/negative outcome for F 323 may include, but is not limited to: Injuries sustained from falls a nd/or unsafe wandering/elopement; Resident-to-resident altercations; Thermal burns from spills/immersion of hot water/liquids; Falls due to environmental hazards; Ingestion of chemical substances; and Burns related to smoking materials. 2. Degree of harm (actual or potential) relate d to the noncompliance. Identify how the facility noncompliance caused, result ed in, allowed, or contributed to the actual or potential for harm. Revised September 2007 Page 8 If harm has occurred, determine if the ha rm is at the level of serious injury, impairment, death, compromise, or discomfort; and If harm has not yet occurred, determine the potential for serious injury, impairment, death, or compromise or discomfort to occur to the resident. 3. The immediacy of correction requi red. Determine whether the noncompliance requires immediate correction in orde r to prevent serious injury, harm, impairment, or death to one or more residents. The survey team must evaluate the harm or pot ential for harm based upon the following levels of severity for Tag F323. First, the team must rule out whether Severity Level 4, Immediate Jeopardy to a resident's health or safety, exists by evaluating the deficient pr actice in relation to immediacy, culpability, and severity. (Follow the guidance in Appendix Q, Guidelines for Determining Immediate Jeopardy .) Severity Level 4 Considerati ons: Immediate Jeopardy to Resident Health or Safety Immediate Jeopardy is a situation in which th e facility's noncomplian ce with one or more requirements of participation: Has allowed, caused, or resulted in (or is likely to allow, cause, or result in) serious injury, harm, impairment , or death to a resident; and Requires immediate correction, as the facility either created the situation or allowed the situation to continue by failing to impl ement preventive or corrective measures. NOTE: The death or transfer of a resident, who was harmed or injured as a result of facility noncompliance, does not always remove a finding of Immediate Jeopardy. The facility is required to implem ent specific actions to correct the noncompliance which allowed or caused the Immediate Jeopardy. When considering Severity Level 4, the surv ey team must have already determined noncompliance in the facility pr actices to provide a safe resi dent environment. Examples of negative outcomes that occurred or have the potential to occur as a result of the noncompliance might include the following: Esophageal damage due to inges tion of corrosive substances; Loss of consciousness rela ted to head injuries; 3 rd degree burn, or a 2 nd degree burn covering a large surface area; Fracture or other injury that may require surgical intervention and results in significant decline in mental and/or physical functioning; Electric shock due to use of unsafe or improperly maintained equipment; Entrapment of body parts, such as limbs, head, neck, or chest that cause injury or death as a result of defective or impr operly latched side ra ils or spaces within side rails, between split rails, between rails and the mattress, between side rails and the bed frame, or spaces between side rails and the head or foot board of the bed; Entrapment of body parts, such as limbs, head, neck, or chest that causes or has the potential to cause serious injury, harm, impairment or death as a result of any manual method, physical or mechanical device, material, or equipment; Revised September 2007 Page 9 Fall(s) that resulted in or had the potential to result in serious injury, impairment, harm or death (e.g. fracture or other injury that may require surgical intervention and/or results in signific ant decline in mental and/or physical functioning), and the facility had no esta blished measure(s) or practice(s), or ineffective measure(s) or practice(s), that would have prevented the fall or limited the resident's injury; or Unsafe wandering and/or elopement that re sulted in or had the potential to result in serious injury, impairment, harm or d eath (e.g., resident le aves facility or locked unit unnoticed and sustained or ha d potential to sustain serious injury, impairment, harm or death), and the faci lity had no established measure(s) or practice(s), or ineffective measure(s) or practice(s), that would have prevented or limited the resident's exposure to hazards. NOTE: If Immediate Jeopardy has been ruled out based upon the evidence, then evaluate whether actual harm that is not i mmediate jeopardy exists at Severity Level 3. Severity Level 3 Considerat ions: Actual Harm that is Not Immediate Jeopardy Severity Level 3 indicates noncompliance that results in actual harm and can include but may not be limited to clinical compromise, dec line, or the resident's ability to maintain and/or reach his/her highest practicable well-being. When considering Severity Level 3, the surv ey team must have already determined noncompliance in the facility pr actices to provide a safe resi dent environment. As a result of the noncompliance, a nega tive outcome occurred. Some examples of compromise include: Short-term disability; Pain that interfered with normal activities; 2nd degree burn; Fracture or other injury that may requi re surgical interv ention and does not result in significant decline in mental and/or physical functioning; Medical evaluation was necessary, and treatment beyond first aid (e.g., sutures) was required; Fall(s) that resulted in actual harm (e.g., short-term disability; pain that interfered with normal activities; fracture or other injury that may require surgical intervention and does not result in signif icant decline in mental and/or physical functioning; or medical evaluation was n ecessary, and treatment beyond first aid (e.g., sutures) was required) and the faci lity had established measure(s) or practice(s) in place that limited the reside nt's potential to fall and limited the resident's injury and prevented the harm from rising to a level of immediate jeopardy; or Unsafe wandering and/or elopement that re sulted in actual harm and the facility had established measure(s) or practice(s) in place that limited the resident's exposure to hazards and prevented the harm from rising to a level of immediate jeopardy. NOTE: Unsafe wandering or elopement that result ed in actual harm and the facility had no established measure(s) or practice(s), or ineffective measure(s) or practice(s) Revised September 2007 Page 10 Revised September 2007 Page 11 that would have prevented or limited the resident's exposure to hazards should be cited at Level 4, Immediate Jeopardy. NOTE: If Severity Level 3 (actual harm that is not immediate jeopard y) has been ruled out based upon the evidence, evaluate whet her Severity Level 2 (no actual harm with the potential for more than minimal harm) exists. Severity Level 2 Considerations: No Actual Harm with Potential for More Than Minimal Harm that is Not Immediate Jeopardy Severity Level 2 indicates noncompliance th at results in a resident outcome of no more than minimal discomfort and/or has the potential to compromise the resident's ability to maintain or reach hi s or her highest practicable level of well being. The potential exists for greater ha rm to occur if interventions are not provided. When considering Severity Level 2, th e survey team must have already determined noncompliance in the facility practices to provid e a safe resident environment. As a result of the noncom pliance, a negative outcome occurred, or the potential for a negative outcome exists, such as the following: Bruising, minor skin abrasions, and rashes; Pain that does not impair normal activities; 1 st degree burn; Medical evaluation or c onsultation may or may not have been necessary, and treatment such as first aid may have been required; Fall(s) which resulted in no more than minimal harm (e.g., bruising or minor skin abrasions; pain that does not impair normal activities; or medical evaluation or consultation ma y or may not have been necessary, and/or treatment such as first aid may have been required) because the facility had additional established measur e(s) or practice(s) that limited the resident's potential to fall or limited th e injury or potential for injury; or Unsafe wandering and/or elopement, which resulted in no more than minimal harm because the facility had additional established measure(s) or practice(s) that limited the resident's exposure to hazards. For example, a resident with Alzheimer's disease left the locked unit and was quickly found unharmed on another unit, and the building was considered a safe environment, as there was no way for the resident to leave the building. Severity Level 1 Considerations: No Actual Harm with Potential for Minimal Harm The failure of the facility to provide a safe environment and adequate supervision places residents at risk for more than mi nimal harm. Therefore, Severity Level 1 does not apply for this regulatory requirement. SELF SURVEY MODULE The facility must ensure that (1) the residen t environment remains as free of accident hazards as is possible. Tag 323 __________________________________________________________________________________ Regulation F 323: The facility must ensure th at (1) the resident en vironment remains as free of accident hazards as is possible. Intent: The intent of this provision is that th e facility prevents accidents by providing an environment that is as free from hazards over which the facility has control. Survey Outline for Hot Water Temperature General Procedures: -Staff should use their (survey team's thermometers). They should be calibrated right before the water temperatures are chec ked. The reason that we use ours is in the beginning we should be getting some t ype of feel for the water temperature. Sometimes placing your hand under the wa ter does not real ly give you a good sense of how hot the water act ually is. If the water is hot, i.e. by our thermometer after we have checked in several places in the building, then we should ask the facility staff to check the temperature of the water. The facility staff should use their thermometer and we would expect them to calibrate it. -We should be with the facility staff when they check the temperatures. - We should start by checking the water te mps in the shower and bathing areas first. These areas are the places that are at highest risk for resident injury. High water temps in resident sinks are probably not going to be immediate and serious. Observations: Take a sample of water temperatures in hand sinks and bathtubs in each unit or hall during peak usage times (i .e., when the facility is do ing dishes or laundry), if possible. Use the facility's thermometer and have facility staff present. After allowing the water to run for while, record the temperature in your notes. If the temperature is greater than 116 degrees Fahrenheit, reque st that the thermometers be calibrated and check agai n. (See note) Note if any steam is seen. Write down the temperature of the water heater's ther mostat serving the affected unit. Observe staff during bathing. Are they testing the water themselves prior to exposing the resident to the water? Footnote: CALIBRATION PR OCEDURES referenced from 1997 Food Code, DHHS, FDA, PHS. A wet ice and boiling water pr ocedure may be used for field checks of the thermometer and sensor. The ice should be broken into very small pieces, packed into an insulated container, and stirred with cold water into very thick slurry. The sensor should be placed at the very center of the container to a depth Revised September 2007 Page 1 1of a least 50-mm (2 inches) and should be frequently agitated. The temperature should be noted when the temperature has stabilized after 3 minutes and should be +/- 2 degrees F from 32 degrees F. INTERVIEWS STAFF INTERVIEWS: X. Direct Care Staff 1.

Each resident's drug regimen must be free from unnecessary drugs. An unnecessary drug is any drug when used: (i) In excessive dose (inc luding duplicate therapy); or (ii) For excessive duration; or (iii) Without adequate monitoring; or (iv) Without adequate i ndications for its use; or (v) In the presence of adverse consequen ces which indicate the dose should be reduced or discontinued; or (vi) Any combinations of the reasons above. 2. Antipsychotic Drugs. Based on a comprehen sive assessment of a resident, the facility must ensure that: (i) Residents who have not used antips ychotic drugs are not given these drugs unless antipsychotic drug therapy is necessary to treat a specific condition as diagnosed and documented in the clinical record; and (ii) Residents who use antipsychotic drugs receive gradual dose reductions, and behavioral interventions, unless clinica lly contraindicated, in an effort to discontinue these drugs. INTENT: \u00a7483.25(l) Unnecessary drugs The intent of this requirement is that each resident's entire drug/medication regimen be managed and monitored to achieve the following goals: The medication regimen helps promote or maintain the resident's highest practicable mental, physical , and psychosocial well-being, as identified by the resident and/or representa tive(s) in collaboration with the attending physician and facility staff; Each resident receives only those me dications, in doses and for the duration clinically indicated to treat the resident's assessed condition(s); Non-pharmacological interventions (such as behavioral interventions) are considered and used when indicated, instead of, or in addition to, medication; Clinically significant adverse c onsequences are minimized; and The potential contribution of the medication regimen to an unanticipated decline or newly emerging or worsening symptom is recogni zed and evaluated, and the regimen is modified when appropriate. NOTE: This guidance applies to a ll categories of medications including antipsychotic medications. Although the regulatory language refers to \"d rugs,\" the guidance in this document generally will refer to \"medications,\" ex cept in those situations where the term \"drug\" has become part of an establis hed pharmaceutical term (e.g., adverse drug event, and adverse drug r eaction or consequence). Revised September 2007 Page 1 For purposes of this guidance, references to \"the pharmacist\" mean the facility's licensed pharmacist, whether employed di rectly by the facility or through arrangement. The surveyor's review of medication use is not intended to constitute the practice of medicine. However, surveyors are e xpected to investigate the basis for decisions and intervention s affecting residents. DEFINITIONS Definitions are provided to clarify terminology related to medications and to the evaluation and treatment of residents. \"Adverse consequence\" is an unpleasan t symptom or event that is due to or associated with a medication, such as impairment or decline in an individual's mental or physical condition or functional or psychosocial status. It may include various ty pes of adverse drug reactions and interactions (e.g., medicationm edication, medication-food, and medication-disease). NOTE: Adverse drug reaction (ADR) is a form of adverse consequences. It may be either a secondary effect of a me dication that is usually undesirable and different from the therapeutic effect of the medication or any response to a medication that is noxious and unintended and occurs in doses for prophylaxis, diagnosis, or treatment. The term \"side effect\" is often used interchangeably with ADR; however, side effects are but one of five ADR categories, the others being hypersensitivity, idiosyncratic response, toxic reactions, and adverse medication interactions. A side effect is an expecte d, well-known reaction that occurs with a predictable frequency and may or may not constitute an adverse consequence. \"Anticholinergic side effect\" is an effect of a medicat ion that opposes or inhibits the activity of the parasympathetic (cholin ergic) nervous system to the point of causing symptoms such as dry mouth, blurred vision, tachycardia, urinary retention, constipati on, confusion, delirium, or hallucinations. \"Behavioral interventions\" are individua lized non-pharmacological approaches (including direct care and ac tivities) that are provided as part of a supportive physical and psychosocial environment, and are directed toward preventing, relieving, and/or accommodating a re sident's distressed behavior. \"Clinically significant\" refers to effects, results, or consequences that materially affect or are likely to aff ect an individual's mental, physical, or psychosocial well- being either positively by preventing, st abilizing, or improving a condition or reducing a risk, or negatively by exacer bating, causing, or contributing to a symptom, illness, or decline in status. \"Distressed behavior\" is behavior that reflects individual discomfort or emotional strain. It may present as crying, apathetic or withdrawn behavior, or as verbal or physical actions such as: pacing, cursing, hitt ing, kicking, pushing, scratching, tearing things , or grabbing others. \"Dose\" is the total amount/strength/con centration of a medication given at one time or over a period of time. The individual dose is the amount/strength/concentration received at each administration. The amount received over a 24-hour period may be referred to as the daily dose. o \"Excessive dose\" means the total amount of any medi cation (including duplicate therapy) Revised September 2007 Page 2 given at one time or over a period of time that is greater than the amount recommended by the manufacturer's label, package insert, current standards of practice for a resident's age and condition, or clinical studies or evidence-based review articles that are p ublished in medical and/or pharmacy journals and that lacks evidence of: - A review for the continued necessity of the dose; - Attempts at, or consideration of th e possibility of, ta pering a medication; and - A documented clinical rationale for th e benefit of, or necessity for, the dose or for the use of multiple medications from the same pharmacological class. \"Duplicate therapy\" refers to multiple medications of the same pharmacological class/category or any medication therapy th at substantially dup licates a particular effect of another medication that the individual is taking. \"Duration\" is the total length of time the medication is being received. o \"Excessive Duration\" means the medication is administered beyond the manufacturer's recommended time frames or facility-established stop order policies, beyond the length of tim e advised by current standards of practice, clinical practice guidelines, clinical studies or evidence-based review articles, and/or without eith er evidence of additional therapeutic benefit for the resident or clinic al evidence that would warrant the continued use of the medication. \"Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS)\" are neur ological side effects that can occur at any time from the first few days of treatment to years later. EPS includes various syndromes such as: o Akathisia, which refers to a distress ing feeling of internal restlessness that may appear as constant motion, the inability to sit still, fidgeting, pacing, or rocking. o Medication-induced Parkinsonism, wh ich refers to a syndrome of Parkinson-like symptoms including tr emors, shuffling gait, slowness of movement, expressionless face, drooling, postural unsteadiness and rigidity of muscles in the limbs, neck and trunk. o Dystonia, which refers to an acute , painful, spastic contraction of muscle groups (commonly the neck, eyes and trunk) that often occurs soon after initiating treatment and is more common in younger individuals. \"Gradual Dose Reduction (GDR)\" is th e stepwise tapering of a dose to determine if symptoms, conditions, or risks can be managed by a lower dose or if the dose or medication can be discontinued. \"Indications for use\" is the identifie d, documented clinical rationale for administering a medication that is base d upon an assessment of the resident's condition and therapeutic goals and is consistent with manufacturer's recommendations and/or clinical practic e guidelines, clinic al standards of practice, medication references, clinical st udies or evidence-based review articles that are published in medical and/or pharmacy journals. \"Insomnia\" is the inability to sleep ch aracterized by difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, early waking, or non-restorative sleep, which may result in impaired physical, social, or cognitive function. \"Medication Interaction\" is the impact of another substance (such as another medication, nutritional supplement including herbal products, food, or substances Revised September 2007 Page 3 used in diagnostic studies) upon a medi cation. The interactions may alter absorption, distribution, metabolism, or elimination. These interactions may decrease the effectiveness of the medicati on or increase the potential for adverse consequences. \"Medication Regimen Review\" (MRR) is a thorough evaluation of the medication regimen by a pharmacist, with the goal of promoting positive outcomes and minimizing adverse conseque nces associated with medication. The review includes preventing, identifyi ng, reporting, and resolving medication- related problems, medication errors, or ot her irregularities in collaboration with other members of the interdisciplinary team. 51 \"Monitoring\" is the ongoing collection and analysis of information (such as observations and diagnostic te st results) and comparison to baseline data in order to: o Ascertain the individual 's response to treatment and care, including progress or lack of progre ss toward a therapeutic goal; o Detect any complications or advers e consequences of the condition or of the treatments; and o Support decisions about modifying, discontinuing, or continuing any interventions. \"Neuroleptic Malignant S yndrome\" (NMS) is a syndrome related to the use of medications, mainly antipsychotics, that typically presents with a sudden onset of diffuse muscle rigidity, high fever, la bile blood pressure, tremor, and notable cognitive dysfunction. It is potentially fatal if not tr eated immediately, including stopping the offending medications. \"Non-pharmacological interventions\" refers to approaches to care that do not involve medications, generally directed towards stabilizing or improving a resident's mental, physical or psychosocial well-being. \"Psychopharmacological medication\" is any medication used for managing behavior, stabilizing mood, or tr eating psychiatric disorders. \"Serotonin Syndrome\" is a potentially seri ous clinical condition resulting from over stimulation of serotonin receptors. It is commonly related to the use of multiple serotonin-stimulating medications (e.g., SSRIs, SNRIs, triptans, certain antibiotics). Symptoms may include rest lessness, hallucinations, confusion, loss of coordination, fast heart beat, rapid changes in blood pressure, increased body temperature, overactive reflexes , nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. \"Tardive dyskinesia\" refers to abnormal , recurrent, involuntary movements that may be irreversible and typically present as lateral movements of the tongue or jaw, tongue thrusting, chewing, frequent blinking, brow arching, grimacing, and lip smacking, although the trunk or other pa rts of the body may also be affected. INVESTIGATIVE PROTOCOL UNNECESSARY MEDICATIONS - MEDICATION REGIMEN REVIEW Because they are closely related, the investig ations of the requirements for medication regimen review and the review for unnecessary medications have been merged. Objectives To determine whether each reside nt receives or is provided: o Only those medications that are clinic ally indicated in the dose and for the duration to meet his or her assessed needs; Revised September 2007 Page 4 o Non-pharmacological approaches when clin ically indicated, in an effort to reduce the need for or the dose of a medication; and o Gradual dose reduction attempts for antipsychotics (unless clinically contraindicated) and tapering of other medi cations, when clinically indicated, in an effort to discontinue the use or reduce the dose of the medication. To determine if the facility in co llaboration with the prescriber: o Identifies the parameters for moni toring medication(s) or medication combinations (including antipsychotic s) that pose a risk for adverse consequences; and for monitoring the eff ectiveness of medica tions (including a comparison with therapeutic goals); and o Recognizes and evaluates the onset or wo rsening of signs or symptoms, or a change in condition to determine whether these potentially may be related to the medication regimen; and follows-up as necessary upon identifying adverse consequences. To determine if the pharmacist: o Performed the monthly medication regime n review, and identified any existing irregularities regard ing indications for use, dose, du ration, and the potential for, or the existence of adverse consequenc es or other irregularities; and o Reported any identified irregularities to the attending physician and director of nursing. To determine whether the facility and/or practitioner acted on the report of any irregularity. Use Use this protocol during every initial and standard survey. In add ition, this protocol may be used on revisits or abbreviated survey (complaint investigation) as necessary. NOTE: This review is not intended to direct medication therapy. However, surveyors are expected to review factors related to the implementation, use, and monitoring of medications. The surveyor is not expected to prove that an adverse consequence was directly caused by a medication or combination of me dications, but rather that there was a failure in the care process related to considering and acting upon such possibilities. If during the course of this review, the surveyor needs to contact the attending physician regarding questions relate d to the medication regimen, it is recommended that the facility's staff have the opportunity to provide the necessary information about the resident and the conc erns to the physician for his/her review prior to respondi ng to the surveyor's inquiries. Procedures Review the medications (presc ription, over-the-counter medications, and nutritional supplements such as herbal products) currently ordered and/or discontinued by the prescriber at l east back to the most recent signed recapitulation/reorder of all medications. Obtain a copy of the current orders if necessary. Gather information regard ing the resident's mental, physical, Revised September 2007 Page 5 functional, and psychosocial status and the medication-related therapeutic goals identified in the care plan as the basis for further review. 1. Observation and Record Review Use the table below to guide observations, record review, and interviews with the resident or represen tative and relevant staff. Observe whether the medication- related interventions are consistently implemented over time and across various shifts. Note deviations from the care plan as well as potentia l medication-related adverse consequences. Verify observations by gathering additional information; for example, additional record reviews a nd/or interviews with the resident or representative, relevant staff, and practitioners. SYMPTOMS, SIGNS, AND CONDITION S THAT MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH MEDICATIONS REVIEW FOR HOW FACILITY M ANAGED MEDICATIONS FOR THE RESIDENT DETERMINE IF THE RESIDENT HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED TO REVIEW THE RECORD (INCLUDING THE CARE SYMPTOMS, SIGNS, AND CONDITIONS THAT MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH MEDICATIONS REVIEW FOR HOW FACILITY M ANAGED MEDICATIONS FOR THE RESIDENT acute care since the last survey and/or has recently (e.g., the previous 3 months) experienced a change in condition or curre ntly has signs and symptoms, such as: Anorexia and/or unplanned wei ght loss, or weight gain Behavioral changes, unusual behavior patterns (including increased distressed behavior) Bleeding or bruising, spont aneous or unexplained Bowel dysfunction including diarrhea, constipation and impaction Dehydration, fluid/electrolyte imbalance Depression, mood disturbance Dysphagia, swallowing difficulty Falls, dizziness, or eviden ce of impaired coordination Gastrointestinal bleeding Headaches, muscle pain, generalized or nonspecific aching or pain Mental status changes, (e.g., new or worsening confusion, new cognitive decline, worsening of dementia(including delirium)) Rash, pruritus Respiratory difficulty or changes Sedation (excessive), insomn ia, or sleep disturbance Seizure activity Urinary retention or incontinence If observations or record review indicate symptoms or changes in condition that may be related to medications (refer to Tables I and II, suppl emented with current medication references), determine whether the facility considered medica tions as a potential ca use of the change or Revised September 2007 Page 6 symptom. plan, comprehensive assessment, and ot her parts of the record as appropriate) to determine whether it reflects the following elements related to medication management for the resident: Clinical indications for use of the medication Consideration of nonpharmacological interventions Dose, including excessive dose and duplicate therapy Duration, including excessive duration Consideration of potential for tape ring/GDR or rationale for clinical contraindication Monitoring for and reporting of: o Response to medications and prog ress toward therapeutic goals o Emergence of medication-related adverse consequences Adverse consequences, if present and potentially me dication-related, note if there was: o Recognition, evaluation, reporting, a nd management by the facility o Physician action regarding potenti al medication-related adverse consequences 2. Interview Interview the resident and or family/respons ible party, to the extent possible, to determine: His/her participation in care planning and decision making, including discussions of the goals relate d to the use of medications; Whether approaches other than medications (as indicated) we re discussed; and His/her evaluation of the results of the medication therapy and other approaches (such as decreasing symptoms of pain, improving functional ability). If during the review, you identify concerns about the lack of indication for use; the dose or duration of a medication; lack of monitoring; failure to implement the care plan; or condition changes or functiona l decline that may be related to the medication regimen, interview knowle dgeable staff to determine: Whether the resident has experienced a ny changes in the functioning or amount of activity that he/she is able to do; The clinical rationale for the use of th e medication, dose or duration and how the interdisciplinary team is monitoring the resident's response to the medication; What process is in place to assure the care plan interventions for medication use are being implemented; Whether they were aware that the signs and symptoms may be adverse consequences related to the medication regimen; Whether the staff had contacted the attend ing physician to discuss the signs and symptoms and the current medication regimen; Whether and how the physician responded wh en informed of suspected adverse medication consequences; and Whether the pharmacist performed a medi cation regimen review and identified related signs and symptoms, or the staff in formed the pharmacist of them if they occurred after the last pharmacist visit. Interview the physician, as appropriate, to determine: Revised September 2007 Page 7 Whether staff notified him/her of pote ntial medication-re lated issues and concerns; His/her assessment of the significa nce of medication -related issues and concerns; and Rationale for his/her management of the resident's medications and/or medication-related issues or concerns. 3. Medication Regimen Review (MRR) Review for compliance with the MRR requirements at F428. Determine: If the pharmacist had identified and re ported to the director of nursing and attending physician any i rregularities with the medication regimen such as: o The emergence or existence of clinically significant adverse consequences; o Excess dose or duration, lack of mon itoring, lack of indication for use, lack of GDR (as indicated) or beha vioral interventi ons for residents receiving antipsychotics, medication in teractions potential ly affecting the medication's effectiveness; and Whether the attending physician and th e director of nursing acted on any irregularities identified in the report. The responses fr om the attending physician could include the following: o Changed the medication regimen in re sponse to the concern raised in the report (or after additiona l review of the situation); o Provided a clinically pertinent rationale that is relevant to that specific resident's signs and symptoms, prognos is, test results, etc., documenting or indicating why the benefit of the medication(s) or dose(s) outweighed the risks of the adverse consequence; o Provided a clinically pertinent ra tionale for why any gradual dose reduction (for antipsychotic medicat ions) and/or tapering (for other medications) is contraindicated, even for a trial period; or o Provided a clinically pertinent rationale for why a particular medication, dose, or duration is appropria te for a resident despite its risks (for example, the resident has had recu rrent seizures unle ss he/she receives anticonvulsant dosing that exceed s the usual recommended serum medication concentration level or th erapeutic range, a nd the attending physician and facility have been mo nitoring for and addressing adverse consequences). If the pharmacist identified a suspecte d adverse consequence, and the attending physician did not respond, determine if staff followed up with the attending physician. NOTE: If the staff and pharmacist identify a medi cation that they believe may be causing a serious adverse conseque nce or a risk of clinic ally significant adverse consequences for the resident, and th e attending physician did not address the risks or harm to the resident, determine what steps staff took; e.g., contacting the medical director to review the situation and address the issue with the attending physician, as necessary. See guidance at 42 CFR 483.75(i) Medical Director (F501) for additional guidance. If prob lems are identified with the MRR, interview the pharmacist, as indicated, to determine: Revised September 2007 Page 8 How he/she conducts the MRR, includi ng the frequency and extent of the medication review and under what circumstances a review might be conducted more often than monthly; How the facility communicates with him/her regarding medication-related issues in specific residents; and How he/she approaches the MRR process for short stay residents. DETERMINATION OF COMPLIANCE (Task 6, Appendix P) Synopsis of Regulation (F329) The unnecessary medication requirement has six aspects in order to assure that medication therapy is appropriate for the individual resident. The facility must assure that medication therapy (including antips ychotic agents) is based upon: An adequate indication for use; Use of the appropriate dose; Provision of behavioral interventions a nd gradual dose reduction for individuals receiving antipsychotics (unless clinically c ontraindicated) in an effort to reduce or discontinue the medication; Use for the appropriate duration; Adequate monitoring to determine whether therapeutic goals are being met and to detect the emergence or presence of adverse consequences; and Reduction of dose or discontinuation of th e medication in the presence of adverse consequences, as indicated. Criteria for Compliance Compliance with 42 CFR 483.25(l), F329, Unnecessary Medications For a resident who has been, or is, receiving me dication(s), the facility is in compliance if they, in collaboration with the prescriber: Assessed the resident to ascertain, to the ex tent possible, the cause s of the condition or symptoms requiring treatment, including recognizing, evaluating, and determining whether the condition or symptoms may have reflected an adverse medication consequence; Based on the assessment, determined that medication therapy was indicated and identified the therapeutic goals for the medication; Utilized only those medicati ons in appropriate doses for the appropriate duration, which are clinically necessary to treat the resident's assessed condition(s); Implemented a gradual dose reduction and behavioral interventions for each resident receiving antipsychotic medications unless clinically contraindicated; Monitored the resident for progress towa rds the therapeutic goal(s) and for the emergence or presence of adverse consequences , as indicated by the resident's condition and the medication(s); and Adjusted or discontinued the dose of a medicat ion in response to adverse consequences, unless clinically contraindicated. If not, cite F329. Noncompliance for F329 After completing the investigation, determ ine whether or not compliance with the regulation exists. Noncompliance for F329 may include: Revised September 2007 Page 9 Inadequate Indications for Use - Examples of noncompliance related to a medication being used without adequate indicati ons include, but are not limited to: o Failure to document a clinical reason or demonstrate a clinically pertinent rationale, verbally or in writing, for using medication(s) for a specific resident. o Prescribing or administering a medication despite an allergy to that medication, or without clarifying whethe r a true allergy existed as opposed to other reactions (e.g., idiosyncratic reaction or other side effect). o Failure to provide a clear clinical rationale for c ontinuing a medication that may be causing an adverse consequence. o Initiation of an antipsychotic medicat ion to manage distressed behavior without considering a possible underlyi ng medical cause (e.g., UTI, congestive heart failure)or environmental or psychosocial stressor. o Initiation of a medicati on presenting clin ically significant risks without considering relative risks and benefits or potentially lower risk medications. o Concomitant use of two or more medi cations in the same pharmacological class without a clinically pertinent explanation. Inadequate Monitoring - Examples of noncomplianc e related to inadequate monitoring include, but are not limited to: o Failure to monitor the responses to or effects of a medicat ion and failure to respond when monitoring indicates a lack of progress toward the therapeutic goal (e.g., relief of pain or normalization of t hyroid function) or the emergence of an adverse consequence. o Failure to monitor a medication consistent with the current standard of practice or manufacturer's guidelines. o Failure to carry out the monitoring that was ordered or failure to monitor for potential clinically significant advers e consequences. For example, use of warfarin in conjunction with: - Inadequate or absent monitoring of PT/INR during treatment; and/or - Failure to recognize and monitor the increased risk of adverse consequences when the resident is receiving other medications that are known to increase the risk of bleeding or to inter act with warfarin and increase PT/INR. Excessive Dose (including duplicate therapy) - Examples of noncompliance related to excessive dose include, but are not limited to: o Giving a total amount of any medication at one time or over a period of time that exceeds the amount recommended by the manufacturer's recommendations, clinical practice guidelines, evidence -based studies from medical/pharmacy journals, or standards of practice for a resident's age and condition, without a documented clinically pertinent rationale. o Failure to consider periodically the c ontinued necessity of the dose or the possibility of tapering a medication. o Failure to provide and/or document a clinical rationale for using multiple medications from the same pharmacological class. Excessive Duration - Examples of noncompliance re lated to excessive duration include, but are not limited to: o Continuation beyond the manufacturer' s recommended time frames, the stop date or duration indicated on the medicati on order, facilityestablished stop order policies, or clinical practice guid elines, evidencebased studies from Revised September 2007 Page 10 medical/pharmacy journals, or current st andards of practice, without documented clinical justification. o Continuation of a medicat ion after the desired therapeutic goal has been achieved without evaluating whether the medication can offer any additional benefit, for example: - Use of an antibiotic beyond the recomm ended clinical guid elines or the facility policy without adequate reassessment of the resident and determination of continuing need. - Failure to re-evaluate the rationale for continuing antipsychotic medication initiated in an emergency after the acute phase has stabilized. Adverse Consequences - Examples of noncompliance rela ted to adverse consequences include, but are not limited to: o Failure to act upon (i.e., discontinue a me dication or reduce the dose or provide clinical justification for why the benef it outweighs the adverse consequences) a report of the risk for or presence of clin ically significant adverse consequence(s); o Failure to respond to actual or poten tially clinically significant adverse consequences related to the use of warf arin when the PT/INR exceeds the target goal. Antipsychotic Medications without Gra dual Dose Reduction and Behavioral Interventions unless Clinically Contraindicated - Examples of noncompliance related to this requirement include, but are not limited to: o Failure to attempt GDR in the absence of identified and documented clinical contraindications. o Prolonged or indefinite antipsychotic use without attempting gradual dose reductions. o Failure to implement behavioral interven tions to enable attempts to reduce or discontinue an antip sychotic medication. Potential Tags for Additional Investigation If noncompliance with 483.25(l) has been id entified, then concerns with additional requirements may also have been identified. The surveyor is cautioned to investigate these related additional require ments before determining whether noncompliance with the additional requirements may be present. Exam ples of some of the related requirements that may be considered when noncompliance has been identified include the following: 42 CFR 483.10(b)(11), F157, No tification of Changes o Review whether the fac ility contacted the atte nding physician regarding a significant change in the re sident's condition in relati on to a potential adverse consequence of a medication, or if the re sident has not responded to medication therapy as anticipated and/or indicated. 42 CFR 483.10 (b)(3) and (4), F154, F155, No tice of Rights and Services and (d)(2) Free Choice o Determine whether the resident was a dvised of her/his medical condition and therapy and was informed about her/his treatment including medications and the right to refuse treatments. 42 CFR 483.20(b), F272, Comprehensive Assessments o Review whether the facility's initial and periodic comprehensive assessments include an assessment of the resident's medication regimen. 42 CFR 483.20(k)(1) and (2), F279, F280, Comprehensive Care Plans o Review whether the resident's comprehensive care plan: Revised September 2007 Page 11 a) was based on the assessment of the resident's conditions, risks, needs, and behavior; b) was consistent with the resident's therapeutic goals; (c) considered the need to monito r for effectiveness based on those therapeutic goals and for the em ergence or presence of adverse consequences; and (d) was revised as needed to address medication-related issues. 42 CFR 483.25(a)(1), F310, Decline in ADL o Review whether the facility had iden tified, evaluated, and responded to a new or rapidly progressive decline in f unction, development or worsening of movement disorders, increased fatigue a nd activity intolerance that affected the resident's ADL ability in relation to pot ential medication adverse consequences. 42 CFR 483.25(d), F315, Urinary Incontinence o Review whether the facility had id entified, evaluated, and responded to a change in urinary function or continence st atus in relation to potential medication adverse consequences. 42 CFR 483.25(f)(1)&(2), F319, F320, Me ntal and Psychosocial Functioning o Review whether the facility had id entified, evaluated, and responded to a change in behavior and/or psychosocia l changes, including depression or other mood disturbance, distress, restlessness, increasing confusion, or delirium in relation to potential medicat ion adverse consequences. 42 CFR 483.25(i)(1), F325, Nutritional Parameters o Review if the facility had identified, ev aluated, and responded to a change in nutritional parameters, anorexia or unpl anned weight loss, dysphagia, and/or swallowing disorders in relation to pote ntial medication adverse consequences. 42 CFR 483.25(j), F327, Hydration o Review if the facility had identified, ev aluated, and responded to a change in hydration or fluid or electr olyte balance (for example, high or low sodium or potassium) in relation to potential medication adverse consequences. 42 CFR 483.40(a), F385, Physician Supervision o Review if the attending physician supervis ed the resident's medical treatment, including assessing the resident's cond ition and medications, identifying the clinical rationale, and monitoring for and addressing adverse consequences. 42 CFR 483.40(b), F386, Physician Visits o Review if the attending physician or de signee reviewed the resident's total program of care and wrote, signed, and dated progress notes covering pertinent aspects of the medication re gimen and related issues. 42 CFR 483.60(c), F428, Medi cation Regimen Review o Review whether the licensed pharmacist has provided consultation regarding the integrity of medicatio n-related records (e.g., MAR, physician order sheets, telephone orders), and potential or actual medication irregularities. 42 CFR 483.75(i), F501, Medical Director o Review whether the medical director, when requested by the facility, interacted with the attending physician regarding a failure to respond or an inadequate response to identified or reported potentia l medication irregularities and adverse consequences; and whether the medical dir ector collaborated with the facility to help develop, implement, and evaluate pol icies and procedures for the safe and effective use of medications in the care of residents. Revised September 2007 Page 12 IV. DEFICIENCY CATEGORIZATION (Part IV, Appendix P) Once the team has completed its investigation, analyzed the data, reviewed the regulatory requirement, and identified any deficient practice(s) that demonstrate that noncompliance with the regulation at F329 exists, the team must determine the severity of each deficiency, based on the resultant harm or pot ential for harm to the resident. The key elements for severity determination for F329 are as follows: 1. Presence of potential or actual harm /negative outcome(s) due to a failure related to unnecessary medications. Examples of actual or potential harm /negative outcomes for F329 may include, but are not limited to: Potential for life-threatening toxicity fr om excessive dose or lack of indication for the use of digoxin. Complications (such as diarrhea with lif e threatening fluid loss, nephrotoxicity, hearing loss, or anaphylactic shock) fr om use of an antibiotic when no clear indication for use has been established or response to the use has not been monitored. Fractures or falls with injury resulti ng from the continuing use of medications (e.g., hypnotics/sedatives, antipsychotics, antidepressants, antihypertensives) in the presence of predisposing risks or adverse conseque nces such as persistent dizziness or recurrent falling without inte rvening or reevaluati ng the need for and dose of the medication believed to be the cause of the gait instability. 2. Degree of potential or actual harm/negat ive outcome(s) due to a failure related to unnecessary medications. Identify how the facility practices caused, resulted in, allowed, or contributed to the actual or potential for harm: If harm has occurred, determine if the ha rm is at the level of serious injury, impairment, death, compromise, or discomfort; or If harm has not yet occurred, determine how likely is the potential for serious injury, impairment, death, compromise, or discomfort to occur to the resident. 3. The immediacy of correction required. Determine whether the noncompliance requires immediate correction in order to prevent serious injury, harm, impairment, or death to one or more residents. The survey team must evaluate the harm or potential for harm based upon the following levels of severity for tag F329. First, the te am must rule out whether Severity Level 4, Immediate Jeopardy to a reside nt's health or safety, exis ts by evaluating the deficient practice in relation to immediacy, culpabil ity, and severity. (Follow the guidance in Appendix Q.) NOTE: The death or transfer of a resident who was harmed or injured as a result of facility noncompliance does not remove a finding of immediate jeopardy. The facility is required to implement specific actions to remove the jeopardy and correct the noncompliance which allowed or caused the immediate jeopardy. Severity Level 4 Considerations: Immediate Jeopardy to Resident Health or Safety Immediate Jeopardy is a situation in which th e facility's noncomplian ce with one or more requirements of participation: Has allowed, caused, or resulted in, or is likely to allow, cause, or result in serious injury, harm, impairment , or death to a resident; and Revised September 2007 Page 13 Requires immediate correction, as the facility either created the situation or allowed the situation to continue by failing to implem ent preventative or corrective measures. Examples may include, but are not limited to: Failure to assess or respond a ppropriately for a resident taking warfarin who had an elevated INR of 9 or greater with or wit hout bleeding, or the elevated INR persisted without assessment/follow-up. Failure to monitor PT/INR for a resident on anticoagulant therapy in accordance with current standards of practice a nd to recognize and/or respond to a life threatening adverse consequence related to anticoagulation. Failure to recognize developing sero tonin syndrome (e.g., confusion, motor restlessness, tremor) in a resident receiving a SSRI, leading to the addition of medications with additive serotonin effect or medication to suppress the symptoms. Failure to recognize and res pond to signs and symptoms of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). In the presence of gastrointestinal bl eeding, the failure to recognize medication therapies (such as NSAIDs or COX-2 inhi bitors, bisphosphonates) as potentially causing or contributing to the gastrointestinal blee d, resulting in the continued administration of the medication, until the resident requir ed hospitalization for severe bleeding. NOTE: If immediate jeopardy has been ruled out based upon the evidence, then evaluate whether actual harm that is not immedi ate jeopardy exists at Severity Level 3. Severity Level 3 Considerations: Actual Harm that is Not Immediate Jeopardy Level 3 indicates noncompliance that resulted in actual harm, and ma y include, but is not limited to, clinical compromise, decline, or th e resident's inability to maintain and/or reach his/her highest practicable well-bei ng. Examples may include, but are not limited to: Facility failure to take appropriate ac tion (e.g., suspending administration of the anticoagulant) in response to an INR greater than 4 and less th an 9 for a resident who is receiving warfarin until spontaneous bruising or frank bleeding occurs, resulting in the need to transfuse or hospitalize the resident. Facility failure to evaluate the medicati on regimen as a potential cause of seizure activity resulting in the addition of anticonvulsants to treat recent-onset seizures that can be adverse consequen ces of medications. Facility failure to implement a GDR that was not contraindicated in a resident receiving prolonged, continuous antipsychotic therapy re sulting in functional decline, somnolence, lethargy, tremors, increased fa lling, or impaired ambulation. NOTE: If Severity Level 3 (actual harm that is not immediate jeopardy) has been ruled out based upon the evidence, then evaluate as to whether Severity Level 2 (no actual harm with the potential for more than minimal harm) exists. Severity Level 2 Considerations: No Actual Harm with Potential for More Than Minimal Harm that is Not Immediate Jeopardy Level 2 indicates noncompliance that resulted in a resident outcome of no more than minimal discomfort and/or has the potential to compromise the resident's ability to maintain or reach his or her highest practicab le level of well-being. The potential exists for greater harm to occur if interventions are not provided. Examples may include, but are not limited to: Revised September 2007 Page 14 Revised September 2007 Page 15 Facility failure to take appropriate action (e .g., change or suspend administration of the warfarin dose) for a resident who has an IN R greater than 4 and less than 9 without any bleeding. Failure to monitor INR for a resident who has been stabilized on warfarin, but who has not had bleeding. Facility failure to identify and act upon minor symptoms of allergic response to medications, such as a rash. Facility failure to monitor for response to therapy or for the emergence or presence of adverse consequences before the resident has experienced an a dverse consequence or decline in function (e.g., monito ring periodically for symptoms of behavioral distress in someone receiving psychopharmacological medication; monitoring thyroid function at least annually in an individual receiving t hyroid hormone replacement; and monitoring hydration status and basic metabolic profile for a resident receiv ing diuretics or ACE inhibitors, who had a change in mental status after the onset of diarrhea). Severity Level 1: No Actual Harm with Potential for Minimal Harm The failure of the facility to provide a ppropriate care and services to manage the resident's medication regimen to avoid unnecessary medications and minimize negative outcome places residents at risk for more than minimal harm. Therefore, Severity Level 1 does not apply for this regulatory requirement.

SELF SURVEY MODULE F 498 Proficiency of Nurse aides - Tag 498 REGULATION: F 498: Proficiency of Nurse aides .: The facility must ensure that nurse aides are able to demonstr ate competency in skills and techniques necessary to care for residents' need s, as identified through re sident assessments, and described in the plan of care. INTENT: The intent of this regulation is to determine if \"competency in skills and techniques necessary to care for residents' needs\" includes competencies in areas such as communication and personal skills, basic nursi ng skills, personal care skills, mental health and social service needs, basic re storative services and residents rights. DATA COLLECTION OBSERVATIONS: During the resident review observe nurse aides. If problems are identified with a particular staff person, continue to observe th at person's performance to determine if it is a one time problem or skill/knowledge base missing. If there is a specific complaint, a concer n or an identified problem with the aides competency then the specific aide, perfor ming this specific task should be observed. Observe other aides to determine if the issue is specific to one aide, or are aides as a rule deficient in this area. Observe: 1. Staff transfers (follows care plan, uses safety belts and straps, uses and secures on lifts; positions for pivots) 2. Incontinence care (front to back t echnique; wash with soap, rinse, dry) 3. Assistance/supervision during resident care activities (during toileting; bathing, dressing, feeding). 4. Handling resident to resident conflict (assistance to room, redirection) 5.
