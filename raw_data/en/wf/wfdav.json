They serve as reference points or recommendations, not rigid criteri a. Guidelines and Principles should be followed in most cases, but there is an understanding that, depending on the patient, the setting, the circumstances, or other factors, care can and should be tailored to fit individual needs. Purpose and Scope : Chronic pain and prescription opioid misuse are both major public health problems that exist across the continuum of care. Pain is a major driver for visits to physicians, a major reason for taking medications, a major cause of disability, and a key factor in quality of life and productivity. These principles aim to identify and promote the essential elements of acute, chronic and palliative pain assessment and management for both children and adults, as well as recognize the risks of opioid use disorder. The Community Principles of Pain Management provide recommendations for primary care clinicians who are assessing, managing and prescribing treatment, including opioids, for acute, chronic pain and active cancer treatment, palliative care, and end- of-life care. The Principles were revised to align with national guidelines developed by a panel of experts and aim to help clinicians meet federal and state regulations . Improving the way opioids are prescribed through clinical practice guidelines and principles can ensure patients have access to safe and effective chronic pain treatment s, while reducing the number of people who misuse or overdose from these drugs. Drug overdose deaths and opioid- involved deaths continue to increase in the United States. Deaths from drug overdose are up among men and women, all races, and adults of nearly all ages. Key Recommendations/Messa ge s: While all patients should be screened for pain, identifying a specific etiology for pain is challenging. A complete assessment, including physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual components is helpful in determining the appropriate course of management. It is essential to establish and focus treatment on patient specific SMART (Specific, Measurable, Agreed Upon, R ealistic, Time-based) goals that result in improved function and quality of life and reduction in suffering. All patients should be engaged in active management of their pain (active approach.) Because chronic pain affects the whole person (body, mind, and spirit), patient -centered nonpharmacologic therapies that acknowledge the patients' roles in their own healing processes have the potential to provide more efficient and comprehensive chronic pain management. Active self -care therapies allow for a more diverse, patient -centered treatment of complex symptoms, promote self-management, and are relatively safe and cost -effective. Treat acute pain actively to avoid transition to chronicity. Treat chronic pain thoughtfully and systematically. Long- term opioid use often begins with treatment of acute pain. When opioids are used for acute pain, clinicians should prescribe the lowest effective dose of immediate- release opioids & no greater quantity than needed for the expected duration of pain severe enough to require opioids. Check Prescription Drug Monitoring Program for opioids or benzodiazepines from other sources. Follow State and federal regulations. Use risk assessment tools (e.g. Opioid Risk Tool -Revised ), treatment agreements (1 Prescriber, 1 Pharmacy) , and medically necessary urine drug testing . Opioids are not first line for chronic pain , which should be managed with an active nondrug approach and non- opioid pain relievers, if possible. Consider opioid therapy based on a careful risk assessment that determines the expected benefits for both pain & function are anticipated to outweigh risks. When opioids are indicated, establish treatment goals and c ombine with an active nondrug approach and & nonopioid pharmacologic therapy , as indicated. When opioids are indicated, develop and document a written treatment plan in the medical record. Review at least annually , using a risk/benefit analysis . Treatment plans must include the goals for pain management and functional improvement based on the patient's diagnosis. A full discussion of how this opioid treatment will be tapered to lower doses or tapered and discontinued, if benefits do not outweigh the risks, is required. The physician must also advise the patient of alternatives to and the risks of alternatives to opioids (informed consent is a discussion of the risks/benefits/alternatives including the alternatives, no treatment, and risks of alternatives) . When opioids are indicated, use a Pain Management Agreement and Informed Consent . 1Continue opioid therapy only if there is clinically meaningful improvement in pain and function that outweighs risks to patient safety. If benefits do not outweigh harms of continued opioid therapy, optimize other therapies and work with patients to taper opioids to lower dosages or to taper and discontinue opioids. Avoid abrupt cessation of opioids . Address opioid- seeking behavior and addiction behaviors without moving patients to illegal means of obtaining opioids. Prescribe Medication- Assisted Therapy (MAT) for opioid use disorder; prescribe naloxone for patients at increased risk for opioid overdosing Ensure safe medication disposal to avoid unauthorized access, reduce potential harm, and conserve the env ironment When to Refer: For acute pain, refer early to appropriate specialist or pain center if diagnosis unclear or pain refractory to treatment . For chronic pain, refer \"difficult to treat\" cases to a physician with pain management expertise. For opioid- seeking behavior and addiction behaviors, refer to addiction or pain specialist and community services as needed.

A complete assessment, including physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual components is helpful in determining the appropriate course of management. All patients should be actively engaged in self -management of their pain (an 'active' approach.) If necessary, therapies that represent a 'passive' approach may be utilized to encourage self -management strategies to help achieve patient centered goals. History: Assess Onset, location, quality, intensity, temporal pattern, aggravating and alleviating factors, associated symptoms Character istics of pain Red flags : indicative of underlying pathology Yellow flags : Psychosocial factors shown to be indicative of long -term chronicity and disability: A negative attitude that pain is harmful or potentially severely disabling; fear avoidance behavior and reduced activity levels; an expectation that passive, rather than active, treatment will be beneficial; a tendency to depression, low morale, and social withdrawal; social or financial problems Review previous methods of treatment , response to treatment & adverse reactions Other medical and surgical conditions Substance use Psychosocial History: Assess Depression, anxiety, PTSD, sleep pattern, suicide risk Impact on quality of life, ADLs & functional status Pain coping skills Patient, family, and caregiver's cultural and spiritual beliefs Secondary gain: psychosocial/financial Pain, Function & Quality of Life: Assess Evaluate pain on all patients using the 0 -10 scale (Use Faces Pain Scale - Revised) : A. mild pain: 1 -3 B. mo derate: 4 -7 (interferes with work or sleep) C. severe: 8 -10 (interferes with all activities) Capture variation in pain severity at different sites of pain ( Use Ransford Pain Drawing) Recognize pain varies at different times of day Assess impact of pain on function & quality of life (Use PEG Scale : A Three- Item Scale Assessing Pain Intensity and Interference Ask the patient what matters most and about personal goals for care Diagnosis & Treatment Plan Order and evaluate appropriate diagnostic testing Determine diagnosis Develop & document a written treatment plan in medical records .Goals Treat acute pain actively to avoid transition to chronicity. Treat chronic pain thoughtfully and systematically. If possible, identify and address the etiology of pain, including potential confounders (such as psychosocial issues.) Maintain an active approach that enables the ability to functionsafely and productively . Allow emergence of emotions associated with pain . Establish patient specific S MART (Specific, Measurable, Agreed Upon, Realistic, Time-based) goals that result in improved function and quality of life & reduction in suffering. Nonpharmacologic Therapy: Active Approach Patient and Family Education Cogniti ve Behavioral Therapy; Supportive Psychotherapy Community and Web- based Support Group Exercise: Yoga, Tai Chi, Qi Gong, Walking, Water Therapy Meditation, Mindful Practice; Visualization/Interactive GuidedImagery Physical Therapy; Chiropractic/Osteopathic Care Relaxation Techniques: Biofeedback Nonpharmacologic Therapy: Passive Approach Acupressure (trigger point therapy) Counterstimulation: TENS Cutaneous Stimulation: Ice, Heat Manipulation/Manual Therapies Massage, Music, Hydrobath Therapeutic Touch, Reiki, Healing Touch Pharmacologic Therapy Nonpharmacologic therapy and nonopioid pharmacologic therapy are preferred for treatment of pain. For neuropathic pain, use anti -epilepsy drugs (AEDs) first Use adjuvant therapies or analgesics as needed Opioids are not first line for chronic pain , which should be managed with an active approach and non- opioid pain relievers, if possible. Consider opioid therapy based on a careful risk assessment that determines the expected benefits for both pain & function are anticipated to outweigh risks. If opioids are used, establish treatment goals, combine w/active approach & nonopioid analgesics as indicated. When opioids are indicated establish treatment goals, combine with an active approach & adjuvant medication as indicated. See Opioid Guidelines on Equianalgesic Table for Adults. Avoid combination with potentiatordrugs (i.e. benzodiazepines)General Reassess pain, quality of life and function regularly, focusing on patient -centered goals Follow amount and duration of response Partner with patient/family in setting goals of care Balance function vs. acceptable control of pain Referrals Acute pain Refer early to appropriate specialist or Pain Center,if diagnosis unclear or pain refractory to treatment Chronic pain Set realistic chronic care goals Transition from passive recipient to patient -directed management. Refer \"difficult to treat\" cases (H/O substanceabus e, neuropathic pain, rapidly escalating opioid doses) to physician with pain management expertise Special Considerations for Patients on Opioids Use risk assessment tools (e.g. O RT-R), treatment agreements, and medically necessary urine drug testing for c ompliance/diversion Check Prescription Drug Monitoring Program for opioids or benzodiazepines from other sources Follow state and federal regulations Evaluate benefits & harms w/patients in 1- 4 wks. of starting opioid for chronic pain or dose escalation. Consider co -prescribing naloxone in at -risk patients (i.e. H/O substance abuse, high MME dose, polypharmacy) Review safe disposal of opioids Evaluate benefits & harms of continued therapy with patients every 3 months or more frequently. If benefits do not outweigh harms of continued opioid therapy, optimize other therapies and work with patients to taper opioids to lower dosages or to taper and discontinue opioids. Avoid abrupt cessation of opioids Address opioid -seeking behavior and addiction behaviors without moving patients to illegal means of obtaining opioids.

See Opioid Guidelines on Equianalgesic Table for Children. Avoid inappropriate use of opioids; prevents potential misuse Older children and adolescents are not immune to opioiddependence, addiction, abuse and experimentation. Opioids are often prescribed for acute sports injuries and other trauma: the lowest possible doses and briefest duration of therapy should be used to minimize risk of dependence and addiction.

The following chart summarizes the uses and cautions that apply to many of the non -opioid analgesic medications. Doses are not definitive and must be individualized to the specific needs of the patient. Choice of agent should take into account other concurrent medical conditions and treatment modalities. Th e common use in chronic pain management represents both FDA approved indications and off -label uses. Some medications have multiple effects that can be used to treat the patient's pain as well as other comorbid conditions that are often found to co -exist w ith chronic pain (e.g. depression, anxiety, insomnia) . Neuropathic pain encompasses multiple conditions, such as painful polyneuropathy (e.g. diabetic neuropathy) , post -herpetic neuralgia, and central neuropathic pain. Non -opioid Pharmacologic Therapy for Chronic Pain in Adultsa, 2 Drug Common Use(s) Suggested Dose(s) Clinical Considerations Analgesics Acetaminophen15 Musculoskeletal pain Up to 3,000 -4000mg/day, divided doses dependent on formulation Not anti-inflammatory Acetaminophen's recommended maximum daily dose (MDD) is 3000mg if patient is self-treating or 4000mg if their health care professional instructs them to do so. The MDD may be decreased for patients who consume alcohol (e.g. >3 alcoholic beverages per day) or have elevated liver enzymes NSAID, COX -2 selective NSAID Musculoskeletal pain Indication specific Assess risk of nephrotoxicity, drug interactions, CV disease and GI toxicity prior to prescribing; administer with PPI or H2 blocker if GI intolerance or high risk; risk of cardiac adverse events (ibuprofen > naproxen); COX 2 agents ma ybe preferred agents for cardiac & renal safety; consider topical agents for individuals unable to use oral therapy Anticonvulsants Carbamazepine7-9 Trigeminal or glossopharyngeal neuralgia Initial: 100mg/day, increase weekly by 100 -200mg/day Effective: 200-400mg three times Common AEs: dizziness, drowsiness, vomiting, xerostomia , weakness, Major AEs: aplastic anemia and serious dermatologic reactions (e.g. toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens -Johnson syndrome) , test for HLA - B*1502 allele prior to initiating treatment in patients with Asian ancestry, including South As ian Indians, as they have an increased likelihood of carrying this allele Consider monitoring blood levels, particularly after dosage adjustment.

For more up to date information please refer to the medication's package insert available on the FDA website (www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/ ). Decisions regarding the pharmacological management of a patient's condition should be made based on the individual needs of the patient (i.e. frequency of dosing, duration of action needed). G uidelines and principles are intended to be flexible. They serve as reference points or recommendations, not rigid criteria. Guidelines & principles should be followed in most cases, but there is an understanding that, depending on the patient, the setting, the circumstances, or other factors, care can and should be tailored to fit individual needs.

There are many different types of exercise, including aerobic, strengthening, and flexibility, and this should be considered when interpreting evidence. There is a moderate level of evidence supporting exercise as an intervention for chronic LBP ( www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/low -back -pain). The benefit of exercise for pain control likely comes from the impact of exercise on the endogenous opioid system and on central pain modulatory systems. Patients with some chronic pain conditions seem to have a dysfunctional endogenous pain modulatory system, which should be considered when prescribing exercise. The prescription of exercise for chronic pain must address the biomechanical issues and the psychosocial factors that contribute to the patient's pain and disability. Patient education, coordination of care within the health care team, and selecting an exercise regimen that is meaningful to and achievable by the patient are all -important components to promote a successful rehabilitation program. Exercise therapy for chronic pain. Kroll HR. Phys Med Rehabil Clin N Am. 2015 May;26(2):263- 81 Exercise , not to exercise , or how to exercise in patients with chronic pain? Applying science to practice. Daenen L, Varkey E, Kellmann M, Nijs J. Yoga /Tai Chi Yoga is a movement and spiritual discipline that originated in India. There is a growing body of evidence supporting yoga as an effective approach to treating chronic pain conditions, including low back pain, osteoarthritis, and fibromyalgia. https://nccih.nih.gov/health/yoga Yoga has been found to reduce pain and improve function in these populations (Nahin RL et al. Evidence- based evaluation of complementary health approaches for pain management in the united states. 2016; 91 (9): 1292- 1306.). Yoga required active participation, can be practiced individually or in groups, and can be combined with mindfulness practices . T ai Chi is a nother movement discipline, originally developed as a martial art form in China, which entails the performance of slow, gentle, focused movements. There is evidence to support Tai Chi as effective in reducing chronic pain associated with osteoarthritis and low back pain. (Kong, L. J. et al. Tai Chi for Chronic Pain Conditions: A Systematic Review and Meta- analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials. Sc i. Rep. 6 , 25325; doi: 10.1038/srep25325 (2016). Tai Chi also requires active participation, individually or in groups. 13Mindfulness Meditation Although there is not a large pool of evidence available on the effectiveness of meditation on pain, recent individual studies are promising, for example: Zeidan F, Adler -Neal AL, Wells RE, et al. Mindfulness -meditation -based pain relief is not mediated by endogenous opioids. Journal of Neuroscience. 2016;36(11):3391 -3397 -this study found that meditation was effective in reducing experimentally induced pain. Two RCT's, one published in JAMA, found meditation to be effective in treating chronic low back pain: Cherkin DC, Sherman KJ, Balderson BH, Cook AJ, Anderson ML, Hawkes RJ, Hansen KE, Turner JA. Effect of Mindfulness -Based Stress Reduction vs Cognitive Behavioral Therapy or Usual Care on Back Pain and Functional Limitations in Adults With Chronic Low Back Pain A Randomized Clinical Trial . JAMA. 2016;315(12):1240- 1249. doi:10.1001/jama.2016.2323 Psychological Approaches (Cognitive - Behavioral, Relaxation techniques) Systematic reviews provide evidence that cognitive -behavioral interventions improve function and decrease pain in the non- specific low back pain population when compared to no intervention (Richmond H et al, 2015). Evidence for effectiveness in treating headaches is equivocal (Harris P et al, 2015). According to AHRQ, when considered in conjunction with other psychological approaches including relaxation techniques and biofeedback, the strength of evidence is low for reducing pain and improving function in the chronic low back pain population (www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/low -back -pain .). May include multiple different interventions. CBT is effective in altering mood and catastrophising outcomes, when compared with treatment as usual/waiting list, with some evidence that this is maintained at six months. Behaviour therapy has no effects on mood, but showed an effect on catastrophising immediately post - treatment. Sturgeon JA. Psychological therapies for the management of chronic pain. Psychology Research and Behavior Management . 2014;7:115- 124. doi :10.2147/PRBM.S44762. Relaxation Techniques Relaxation training follows a specific method, process, procedure, or activity with the intent to release physical tension and refocus the mind away from anxious, angry, or disturbing thoughts in order to reduce stress and/or pain and achieve a sense of well -being and calmness Lee C, Crawford C, Hickey A.

Pain Med. 2014 Apr;15 Suppl 1:S21- 39. doi: 10.1111/pme.12383. 14Superficial Heat There is moderate level evidence that heat decreases pain and improves function for acute phase low back pain - at 4-5 days. There is low level evidence that heat is more effective than acetaminophen or ibuprofen for acute phase pain.

Intervention Summary Comments PASSIVE Acupuncture Has been found to be effective in the treatment of a variety of conditions, including chronic low back pain (LBP) and osteoarthritis (OA). NIH considers acupuncture a \"reasonable\" option for OA (nccih.nih.gov) . Low to moderate level of evidence for chronic back pain according to AHRQ (www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/low -back-pain). Acupuncture is effective for the treatment of chronic pain and is therefore a reasonable referral option. Significant differences between true and sham acupuncture indicate that acupuncture is more than a placebo. However, these differences are relatively modest, suggesting that factors in addition to the specific effects of needling are important contributors to the therapeutic effects of acupuncture.

Arch Intern Med. 2012 Oct 22;172(19):1444- 53.) A dditionally, in a recent systematic review and meta-analysis, acupuncture was found to provide significant relief of low back pain compared to sham acupuncture and no treatment (Yuan QL, Guo TM, Liu L, Sun F, Zhang YG.

Pain, 108, 137-147. Massage May be helpful for low back pain. There is a l ow level of evidence for acute and subacute low back pain (nccih.nih.gov). This is consistent with the findings of the AHRQ analysis for massage as a treatment of acute and subacute low back pain (www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/low -back -pain.) S imilar findings can be found for massage as a treatment for fibromyalgia, neck pain, and osteoarthritis, with generally short -term improvements in pain, and no significant long- term improvements in function (Nahin RL et al. Evidence- based evaluation of complementary health approaches for pain management in the united states. 2016 ; 91 (9): 1292- 1306.) Manipulation Manipulation has been studied extensively for the treatment of low back pain (LBP). Manipulation has been found to be effective in reducing pain and improving function in people with LBP. There is low -to- moderate level evidence that it is effective in the chronic LBP population ( www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/low -back-pain.). It is recommended for the treatment of non- specific low back pain in the majority of national clinical guidelines for LBP management. There is less evidence to support its use in the treatment of neck pain. It has been found to be effective in the treatment of some types of headache and osteoarthritis. C hiropractors, Osteopathic Physicians, and Physical Therapi sts most commonly utilize manipulation in back pain management. Although it is a passive intervention, it is often combined with exercise in patient management. Electrotherapy / TENS Passive physical modalities as a whole have small -to-no effect on treating common pain problems (AHRQ). Systemic reviews suggest that TENS is effective for post- operative pain, osteoarthritis, diabetic neuropathy, and some acute pain 16conditions when applied at adequate intensities. T here is insufficient evidence to recommend specific TENS regimes at this time. ( Vance, C., Dailey, D., Rakel, B., & Sluka, K. (2014). Using TENS for pain control: the state of evidence. Pain Management, 4(3), 197-209 and Chou, R., Gordon, D., de Leon- Casasola, O., Rosenberg, J., et al. (2 016). Guidelines on the Management of Postoperative pain. Journal of Pain, 17(2), 131- 157) AHRQ Levels of Evidence: High : High confidence that the evidence reflects the true effect. Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. Moderat e: Moderate confidence that the evidence reflects the true effect. Further research may change our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. Low: Low confidence that the evidence reflects the true eff ect. Further research is likely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. Insufficient: Evidence either is unavailable or does not permit a conclusion. 17Faces Pain Scale -Revised (FPS -R) P urpose: To assess pain intensity in persons who are able to self -report , but unable to use a numeric rating scale (NRS). Some studies show African Americans and Asians prefer the FPS. W hen to Use: 1) At admission 2) At each quarterly nursing review 3) Each shift in resident with pain 4) Each time a change in resident pain status is reported 5) Following a pain intervention to evaluate treatment effectiveness Ho w to Use: Instruct t he person that \"The faces show how much pain or discomfort one is feeling. The face on the left shows no pain. Each face shows more and more pain up to the last face that shows the worst pain possible. Point to the face that shows how bad your pain is right now .\" T hen s core the chosen face 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10, counting left to right, so '0' = 'no pain' and '10' = 'very much pain.' N OTE: This tool is not to be used by the health care provider to look at the resident's facial expression and pick a face. D ocumentation: Document/record all scores in a location that is readily accessible by other health care providers.

A ccessed with permission from GeriatricPain.org 18The Ransford Pain Drawing Purpose This is a useful tool to enable the patient to give the evaluator an idea of where they feel certain symptoms. This may be done in an informal way during the initial intake interview and the drawing will prompt di alogue between the two parties regarding symptoms, their frequency, behavior and when they occurred in relation to others. Alternatively, this may be done in a formal way utilizing the Ransford Pain Drawing (Ransford, et al, 1976). The Ransford Pain Drawing is used to assess the pain and psychodynamics in a patient with low-back pain. Administration Provide the patient with a body chart compri sing anterior and posterior views of the body. If the informal version is used, ask the client to indicate on the chart where they feel symptoms using a key to describe di fferent symptoms. The evaluator may ask the client to elaborate on each symptom during the process or at the end. The client may make notes on the chart to fu rther describe symptoms. The Ransford Pain Drawing must be done on a specific body chart with four symptoms described above, namely stabbing, burning, pins and needles, and numbness. The instructions are at the top of the chart and read as follows : \"Indicate where your pain is located and what type of pain you feel at the present time. Use the symbols below to describe your pain. Do not indicate areas of pain which are not related to your present condition.\" Ransford showed that the drawings drawn by patients in the study correlated very well with the Hypochondria's and Hysteria scores on an MMPI (Minnesota Mulitphasic Personality Inventory) ta ken at the same time. Scoring The evaluator should observe the drawing and determine if any of the criteria listed below feature in the drawing. The appropriate sc ore is given and all scores are totaled at the end to reach a final score. 1. Unreal drawing (Poor anatomic local ization, scores 2 unless indicated; bilateral pain not wei ghted unless indicated). A.Total leg pain B.Lateral whole leg pain (trochanteri c area and lateral thigh allowed) C.Circumferential thigh pain D.Bilateral anterior tibial area pain (unilateral allowed) E.Circumferential foot pain (scores 1) F.Bilateral foot pain (scores 1) G.Use of all four modalities suggested in instructions (We feel patient is unlikely to have \"burning areas\", stabbing pain, pins-and-needles and numbness all together; scores 1) 192. Drawing showing expansion or magnificat ion of pain. (May also represent unrelated symptomology. Bila teral pain not weighted.) A.Back pain radiating to iliac crest, groi n or anterior perine um (each scores 1; coccygeal pain allowed) B.Anterior knee pain (scores 1) C.Anterior ankle pain (scores 1) D.Pain drawing outside the outline; this is a particularly good indication of magnification (scores 1 or 2 depending on extent). 3. \"I particularly hurt here\" indicators. Some patients need to make sure the evaluator is fully aware of the extent of symptoms (each category scores 1; multiple use of each category is not weighted). A.Add explanatory notes B.Circle painful areas C.Draw lines to demarcate painful areas D.Use arrows E.Go to excessive trouble and detail in demonstrating the pain areas (using the symbols suggested). 4. \"Look how bad I am\" indicators.A.Additional painful areas in the tr unk, head, neck or upper extremities drawn in. Tendency towards total body pain (scores 1 if limited to small areas, otherwise scores 2). Interpretation A score of 3 or above indicates poor psychodynamics. The test is also useful as a distraction test to observe patient beha vior while sitting or standing, depending what position he/s he is in when doing the drawing. This test takes approximately 5 to 8 minutes to administer and approximately 5 minutes to score. 20INSTRUCTIONS Indicate where your pain is located and what type of pain you feel at the present time.

Consider Major Depressive Disorder - if there are at least 5 3s in the shaded section (one of which corresponds to Question #1 or # 2) Consider Other Depressive Disorder - if there are 2-4 3s in the shaded section (one of which corresponds to Question #1 or #2) No te: Since the questionnaire relies on patient self-report, all responses should be verified by the clinician, and a definitive diagnosis is made on clinical grounds ta king into account how we ll the patient understood the questionnaire, as well as other rele vant information from the patient. Diagnoses of Major Depressive Disorder or Other Depressive Disorder also require impairment of social, occu pat ional, or other important areas of functioning (Question #10) and ruling out normal bereavement, a history of a Manic Episode (Bipolar Disorder), and a physical disorder, medication, or other drug as the biological cause of the depressive symptoms. To m onitor severity over time for newly diagnosed patients or patients in c urrent treatment for depression: 1 . Patients may complete questionnaires at baseline and at regular intervals (eg, every 2 week s) at ho me and bring them in at their next appointment for scoring or they may complete th e que stionnaire during each scheduled appoin tment. 2.Add up 3s by column.

Assess and manage pain in adult patients using the CPPM Adult Guide. N.B. Opioids are not first line for chronic pain, even moderate to severe pain, which should be managed with an active approach and non-opioid pain relievers whenever possible. B When opioids are indicated, based on a careful risk assessment, combine with an active and passive approach to nonpharmacologic therapy. Be wary of dose escalation over time due to tolerance. 2. How to dose opioids: A. Give baseline medication around the clock. B. For breakthrough pain order 10% total daily dose as a PRN given q 1 -2h for oral and q 30 -60 min for SC/IV. C. For continuous infusion, PRN can be either the hourly rate q 15 min or 10% of total daily dose q 30 -60 min. D. Adjust baseline upward daily in amount roughly equivalent to total amount of PRN. E. Determine acceptable level of pain control that support patient's goals . 3. In general, oral route is preferable, then trans -cutaneous > subcutaneous > intravenous. 4. If parenteral medication is needed for mild to moderate pain,use half the usual starting dose of morphine or equivalent. 5. Use a short -acting medication for acute pain exacerbation. Switch to long -acting preparations when pain is chronic and the total daily dose is determined. 6. Avoid multiple agents of s imilar duration. 7. When converting from one opioid to another, some experts recommend reducing the equianalgesic dose by 1/3 to 1/2, then titrate as in #2 above. 8. Older adults, or those with severe renal or liver disease, should start on half the usual starting dose. Watch carefully for toxicity from accumulation. 9. Use care with combinations. Ensure total consumption of APAP from ALL sources & ALL purposes does not exceed 3 g/day (2 -3 g for frail elders). 10. Patients with substance abuse history may need a higherstarting dose due to tolerance. Monitor urine drug screenings. Consider abuse -deterrent opioids &/or co -prescribing naloxone . 1 information fentanyl use. Review CPPM methadone and buprenorphine guidelines. 12. Refer to protocol for naloxone us e. 13.

Opioids are sometimes called narcotics. I understand they may be helpful . I also recognize that these medicines are dangerous if not taken correctly. They may be misuse d. Because of possible danger and misuse, they are closely controlled by my medical providers and by law. The following conditions will help give me the best pain relief and avoid misuse. I agree to follow them: ______ 1. I will take my pain medicines correctly. I agree to take the medicine only as prescribed. I will contact my provider before making any changes. I understand that taking more of my medicine than prescribed could lead to a drug overdose. An overdos e m ay cause my heart or breathing to become very slow or stop. This could lead to death. I understand that physical dependence is normal and expected when using these medicines for a long time. I understand that physical dependence is not the same as addiction. I understand that decreasing or stopping my medicine suddenly could lead to withdrawal symptoms . These include sweating, chills, and j oint pain. I may also have trouble sleeping or be sick to my stomach. If I need to stop taking my medicine, I w ill follow my provider's direction to do so slowly. I understand that my pain medicine may cause addiction or opioid use disorder . Addiction means a lack of control over the use of the medic ine. Lack of control includes using the medicine in spite of harm to me or craving the medic ine. Harm could be physical, mental or social. I understand that tolerance means that I may require more medicine to obtain the same amount of pai n r elief. Taking more medicine may not lessen my pain. Instead, it may cause distressing side effects . T olerance or failure to respond well to my medicine may lead my provider to choose another form of treatment. I understand that my provider will review the effect of my medicine with me on a regular basis. If my quality of life does not get better, the medicine may be stopped. In that case, I will follow my provider's direction t o s lowly stop my opioid medicine. ______ 2. I will report side effects. I understand that there are side effects from my opioid medicine. I will tell my provider at my next appointment about any side effects that are new, don't go away, or affect my thinking. These may include: Drowsiness Confusion Constipation Nausea Hallucinations (seeing things that aren't there) Vomiting Itching Dizziness Slowed breathing Slowed reaction times For most people, these side effects decrease with continued use of the medicine. I will not involve myself in any activity that may be dangerous to me or someone else if I feel drowsy or am not thinking clearly. Such activities include but are not limited to: oDriving a motor vehicle or using heavy equipment oBeing responsible for another individual who is unable to care for himself ______ 3. I will tell all of my medical providers that I am taking opioid medicine. I understand that other medicines and substances can affect the way opioid medicines work in my body. I understand that taking opioid medicines with alcohol may cause: overy slow breathing overy low blood pressure oextreme drowsiness oand even death. I understand that I should not drink alcohol or take medicines containing alcohol while taking my opioi d m edicine . I understand that I must talk with my provider before taking other medicines . Some common medicines that may interact with my oMedical Marijuana I will tell my provider as soon as possible if I need to visit another provider or the Emergency Room due t o pai n. If I go to the Emergency Room, I will tell the Emergency Room provider that I have signed this pai n agr eement . Failure to do so may result in my discharge from care. ______ 4. I will not use stre et drugs while on opioid medicine. If I have misused substances or alcohol in the past, I have discussed this with my provider. I agree to provide urine and blood for drug screening at any time my provider asks me. These tests will show the use of prescription and street drugs. I will not use any drugs that were not prescribed for me. ______ 5. I will tell my provider right away if I become pregnant or am planning to become pregnant. ______ 6. I will keep my appointments. ______ 7. I will keep track of my medicine and prescription refills. I understand that prescription refills : Will b e written for a time period that my prescriber believes is safe. Will not be given if I : oRun out early oLose the prescription oSpill or misplace the medicine oHave the medicine stolen . W ill be refilled at the same pharmacy unless I have made other plans with my provider. ______ 8. I will keep my opioid medicine safe in a LOCKED place. I understand that the opioid medicine is only for my use. The medicine should never be given or sold t o ot hers. If I have children in the house, I will ask the pharmacy for a childproof top. If my medic ine is stolen, I will report this to my local police department . I will also get a stolen item report. I will safely dispose of unused opioid medicine. ______ 9. I have received education about my opioid medicine. I have had the chance to ask my provider questions about my opioid medicine. ______ 10. I understand that I need to follow all of the above co nditions . If I do not follow these conditions, my provider may no longer prescribe opioid medicines for me. I also understand that if I have a problem or question with any of the above information, I will discuss this with my provider . ______ 11. I understand the importance of obtaining my opioid prescription from one prescriber and one pharmacy. I understand that the effect of my medicine will be reviewed with my provider on a regular basis. If my daily function or quality of life does not get better from the opioid medicine, it may be stopped. In that case, I will follow my provider's direction to slowly stop my opioid medicine. I have read the above information (or it has been read to me) and have received a copy of the agreement. I understand my responsibilities and agree to these conditions while receiving opioid medic ines. ________________________________ _____________________________ Patient Prescriber Signature Date My Prescriber I agree to obtain my opioid prescription from: _____________________________ My PHARMACY I agree to obtain my opioid prescription from : ____________________________ I will re port side effects to: __________________________________________________________ The OPIOID medicine that I have been prescribed is: ____________________________________ 33Approved June 2019 . Next Scheduled Update in 2021 .Opioid Use Disorder Community Principles of Pain Management P rescription drug abuse continues as a health care problem in our nation and state. Despite the fact that the NYS PDMP(Prescription Drug Monitoring Progr am, has yielded a 75% improvement in \"doctor shopping\" for opioid prescriptions, since 2013, death by overdose on prescription opioids remains significant in NYS (4.9/100,000 in 2012,2013,2014)1 I n 2005- 2014 unintentional injury (where overdoses are classified) was the Number one cause of death for ages 15- 44. (Suicide was number 4. Homicide number 5 for this age group) 2 According to the 2009 Partnership Attitude Tracking Study, over half of teens agree prescription drugs are easier to get than illegal drugs. Most teens surveyed believe that the prescription drugs are being taken from the family medicine cabinet. 1 in 7 teens in grades 9- 12 have reported taking a prescription pain reliever for non- medicinal purposes in the past year. T hough the most recent data in NYS shows a significant increase in heroin and fentanyl in overdose deaths (4.2/100,000)1, prescription opioids remain a major source of addiction, and overdose deaths. W hen treating a patient with chronic pain, there must be a balance of controlling the individual's pain with minimizing the risks of treatment. Risk assessment should be conducted prior to initiating opioid therapy. Patients should be assessed for known risk factors. Here is a list of items that elevate a patient's risk for medication misuse and addiction: Perso nal or family history of substance or ETOH abuse History of pre- adolescent sexual abuse Psychiatric illnesses Poor reliability/compliance with medical care Poor social support or unstable living circumstances Youth (age <45) Smoking These risk factors do not exclude an individual from receiving proper pain treatment, but would suggest that this patient may require strict or frequent monitoring. Some aberrant drug taking behaviors are more obvious (such as doctor shopping, prescription forgery, inappropriate route of administration), while others are less suggestive (such as requesting specific drugs, multiple occasions of non- adherence with therapy, resistance to a change in therapy .6 N umerous screening tests are available to assist with risk assessment , including the Opioid Risk Tool (ORT)5, the DIRE (diagnosis, intractability, risk, efficacy) 6,7, and the SOAPP (screener and opioid assessment for patients with pain)8. The Opioid Risk Tool ORT8 is a simple five question survey that can predict an individual's risk. The ORT and DIRE are probably the two most widely used screening tools . Other helpful tools include prescription monitoring programs (available in most states, including New York S tate), random urine drug screening, pill counts and patient education. T erms associated with drug therapy are often used interchangeably; however , they have drastic differences in definition. Below is some of the terminology associated with opioid therapy .9,10 Opioid Use Disorder is a medical condition characterized by the compulsive use of opioids despite advers e c onsequences from continued use and the development of a withdrawal syndrome when opioid use stops. P hysical dependence is a state of adaptation that is manifested by a drug class -specific withdrawal syndrome that can be produced by abrupt cessation or rapid dose reduction of a drug, or by administration of an antagonist. This w ill oc cur in 100% of patients on chronic opioids. Psychological dependence is a subject ive sense of a need for a specific psychoactive substance, either for its positive effects or to avoid negative effects associated with its abstinence. Tolerance is increasing amounts of drug are required to produce an equivalent level of efficacy. This too will occur i n 100% of patients on chronic opioids. Addiction is a primary, chronic disease of brain reward, motivation, memory and related circuitry. Dysfunction i n t hese circuits leads to characteristic biological, psychological, social and spiritual manifestations. This is reflected i n an i ndividual pathologically pursuing reward and/or relief by substance use and other behaviors . Addiction is characterized by inability to consistently abstain, impairment in behavioral control, craving, diminished recognition of significant problems with one's behaviors and interpersonal relationships, and a dysfunctional emotional response. Like other chronic diseases, addiction often involves cycles of relapse and remission. Without treatment orengagement in recovery activities, addiction is progressive and can result in disability or premature death. Addictiv e behav ior is much more common in those at risk as identified in a risk assessment tool which should be utilized befor e pr escribing opioids. 34Approved June 2019 .

However, methadone has a long, variable half -life (ranging from 6 to 190 hours depending on the dosage). The rapid titration guidelines used for other opi oids do not apply to methadone. The dose should not be increased more frequently than every 4 days in lower doses and 1 to 2 weeks in higher doses. Small changes in total daily dosage may progressively have a larger effect on blood level s when patients are on dosages greater than 30 mg per day. Dos e-conversion ratios are complex, non- linear, and vary based on current opioid dosage and individual factors (see table below). Conversion table from morphine to methadone (most commonly used in the USA) 24 hour total dose of oral morphine | Conversion ratio (oral morphine: oral g | Consult with palliative care or pain specialist prior to prescribing Because of the potential for drug accumulation from the long half -life, always write \"hold for sedation\" when initially prescribing or changing dosages of methadone. Converting from methadone back to morphine or other opioids is especially complex, because methadone affects more opioid receptors than other opioid analgesics. Assistance from palliative care or pain management experts is highly recommended for such a transition if patients have been more than 30 mg for more than a few weeks. Because of its long half -life, methadone is better used as a baseline, scheduled analgesic, with shorter -acting opioids such as morphine or hydromorphone used prn. There is some literature suggesting methadone can be used as a prn, however the risks if overused are much greater with methadone. Under most circumstances, unless the prescriber is very familiar with methadone pharmacokinetics and the patient is very reliable, it is safer to use an immediate release opioid as a prn when using methadone as the baseline opioid. The usual calculation ratios and intervals used for determining breakthrough doses of other opioids do not apply to methadone (and fentanyl). Although the ratio of oral methadone to intravenous methadone may v ary fro m 1:1 to 2:1, when converting from oral to intravenous methadone it is prudent to reduce the total daily dose of methadone by 50%. On the other hand, when converting from intravenous methadone to oral methadone, it is recommended to use the most conservative 1:1 conversion to avoid over -medicating the patient. Closely monitor for under - and over -dosing in all transitions . (See Table 1 Patient Selection for Methadone Therapy in McPherson et al) Cautions about Methadone The long half -life causes drug accumulation, and can lead to possible sedation, confusion, and respiratory depression, especially in the elderly or with rapid dose adjustments. Respiratory depression must be tr eated with nalox one i nfusion due to methadone's long half -life. Methadone in moderate to high dosages can prolong the QTc interval and increase the risk of the potentially lethaltorsades de pointes arrhythmia. (See below for greater detail ) Medications that can decrease methadone levels modafinil, and number of antiretroviral agents. Medications that can increase methadone and diazepam. Grapefruit juice and acute ETOH use also can increase methadone level s. Methadone has some serotonin activity and can contribute to serotonin syndrome.Methadone is not a first line pain medication and should be used primarily by thos e with pain and palliative expertise. Despite representing only 2% of opioid prescriptio ns, methadone has been involved in 30% of opioid related deaths in recent years. Inexperienced prescribers should seek consultation. 36Approved in June 2019; Next Schedu led Update in 2021. Careful patient selection and counseling should be undertaken to outline risks and benefits when using methadone. S ample Calculation - Complete Conversion to Methadone A 50-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer has good pain control with sustained- release oral morphine 200 mg, two tablets twice a day. However, she develops persistent myoclonus. A decision is made to rotate opioids to methadone. (Our conversion table [Table 2.1] always requires that the equianalgesic amount of oral morphine be determined to calculate a daily dosage of methadone.) S tep 1. Calculate the total daily oral morphine dosage. T wo tablets of 200 mg each, taken twice daily = 800 mg total oral morphine per day S tep 2. Convert to methadone. For a dosage of 800 mg per day, the conversion ratio of morphine to methadone is 15:1 (see \"Conversion table from morphine to methadone\" on previous page). 800 mg per day oral morphine \u00d7 1 mg methadone/15 mg oral morphine = 53 mg methadone per day S tep 3. Reduce the dosage because of incomplete cross -tolerance. Reduce the equianalgesic dose by 1/2 when switching opioids because of incomplete cross -tolerance. 53 mg \u00d7 1/2 equals about 26 mg methadone Total daily dosage should be about 26 mg methadone per day (general consensus that starting doses should not exceed 30- 40 mg per day - see McPherson et al and Chou et al. ). S tep 4. Determine dosing schedule. Methadone is initially dosed in divided doses three times per day (the analgesic effect is shorter than the half -life, s o m ethadone should be generally given three times per day for pain, even though for methadone maintenance it c an be gi ven daily or even less frequently). A dosage of about 26 mg per day of methadone can be given as 7.5 mg to 10 mg of methadone three times per day (total daily dose of methadone being either 22.5mg or 30mg respectively). When ordering methadone, because of its long and variable half -life, always write \"hold for sedation.\" S tep 5. Choose a prn medication. Because of its potentially long half -life, prn doses of methadone are difficult to manage correctly and are subject t o c ompletely different rules than other prn opioids. Therefore, unless you are a very experienced methadone prescriber , an opi oid with a short half -life is highly preferable for prn dosing. S tep 6. Determine the prn dose (morphine). The prn dose should be 10% of the total daily opioid dosage. Because the patient was already on 800 mg per day of oral morphine, the prn dose based on the prior total daily dosage of morphine would be: 800 mg oral morphine \u00d7 10% = 80 mg oral morphine every 1 to 2 hours as needed. This could be given as 4 cc of 20 mg/cc morphine concentrate or equivalent every 1 to 2 hours as needed. S tep 7. Adjustments to regimen Due to the variable and often long half life, changes in dosing should be made no more frequently than 5-7 days. I n c ases like this where higher doses of methadone are being used, 7- 14 days is advised. Due to multiple drug interactions, close monitoring of the complete medication list of methadone patients is critical P ractical facts Tablets 5, 10mg; Liquid 1mg/mL, 2mg/mL; 10mg/ml . 40mg and addiction tx only . T ablets can be crushed and are reasonably well absorbed sublingually, buccally or rectally if necessary. Cost oxycodone ER, 1/15 of transdermal fentanyl. Any physician with a Schedule II DEA license can prescribe methadone for pain. A special license is only requir ed w hen using for the treatment of addiction. (N.B. Must write \"for pain\" on the prescription when used for pain.) Seek consultation if converting from large doses of other opioids, converting to IV, or if inexperienced. QT c Prolongation D epending on the goals of treatment, the presence of associated heart disease, the patient's prognosis, and t he presence of other medications that prolong QTc, ECG monitoring may be indicated. 37Approved in June 2019; Next Schedu led Update in 2021.If risk factors present, get baseline QTc. oPrevious QTc > 450ms or known congenital abnormalities, hx of ventricular arrhythmias , congestive heart failure oUse of other medications that prolong QTc and have a known risk of TdP (see ht tps://www.crediblemeds.org/ for additional information) ) oElectrolyte abnormalities (especially low K , Ca, and Mg) oHypothyroidism Begin monitoring after each dosage change if their baseline QTc exceeds 450ms and for all patients if and w hen their daily dose exceeds 30mg mg of methadone per day. For high- risk patients, monitor after initiation and each increase . O nce a new steady state has been achieved, repeat ECG; generally about 4- 7 days. There is no need for repeated checking unless dose is changed or another drug is added that would raise t he bl ood level or affect the QTc. If QTc becomes significantly prolonged (QTc 450- 499 milliseconds = moderate risk; QTc > 500 milliseconds = high risk), consider lowering the methadone dosage or rotating to an alternate opioid. Formal or informal consultation with palliative care, acute pain service, cardiology, and pharmacy should be considered.

It binds to various opioid receptors, and acts as a partial agonist at mu- opioid receptors and as an antagonist at kappa receptors . This opioid is used to treat opioid addiction in higher doses and chronic pain in lower doses . There are two properties that distinguish buprenorphine from other opioi ds. First, a ceiling effect occurs as the dose is increased. This contributes greatly to its safety profile but may limit its usefulness for treatment of severe, escalating pain. In other words, a t high doses , the respiratory depressive and analgesic effects level off . In overdose situations , however, respiratory depression can still occur and will be more difficult to treat with naloxone compared to overdoses with other opioids due to buprenorphine's very tight binding to opioid receptors (very high naloxone doses of 10- 35mg may be required) . Secondly, it has a bell -shaped dose- response curve. At moderate to high doses, the euphoric effects also level off, thus lowering its potential for misuse and overdose. The abuse potential of buprenorphine, although low, is further reduced in a transdermal preparation because the plasma levels slowly rise to a therapeutic level, unlike the rapid peak level that occurs with other formulations. B uprenorphine has poor oral bioavailability due to significant first pass metabolism and therefore is not offered as an oral formulation. Buprenorphine is highly lipophilic and well absorbed by the oral mucosa. As such, transdermal, sublingual, and buccal formulations are available in addition to an injectable (intravenous/intramuscular) formulation. Buprenorphine is currently available in four types of single agent products: 1. utrans and Belbuca are FDA indicated for the treatment of chronic pain in patients requiring a continuous, around- the-clock opioid analgesic for an extended period of time. Subutex is not FDA indicated for treatment of acute or chronic pain and carries a manufacturer warning against use as an analgesic due to reported deaths of opioid na\u00efve patients receiving a buprenorphine 2 mg sublingual dose. Sublingual buprenorphine has been successfully studied for postoperative pain control, although caution is warranted if using off label for this indication given the manufacturer warning of fatal overdose at 2 mg in opioid na\u00efve patients (Johnson, Fudala, Payne, 2005). Buprenex is indicated for acute moderate to severe pain. Buprenex has a slow onset of analgesic effect (15 minutes to onset, 1- 3 hours to peak effect) and therefore may not be considered an ideal analgesic choice for acute pain management in comparison to other injectable opioids. Parenteral buprenorphine is approximately 30 times more potent than parenteral morphine (buprenorphine 0.3 mg ~ morphine 10 mg). Please note that all buprenorphine formulations do still carry a black box warning due to the risk of severe, life-threatening respiratory depression B uprenorphine is also available in combination with naloxone for the treatment of substance abuse disorder in products such as Bunavail, Suboxone, and Zubsolv. These medications when used for opioid dependence are limited for use by qualified prescribers. 39Approved in June 2019; Next patch: F or Opioid na\u00efve patients : initiate treatment with a 5mcg/hr patch, replaced weekly . C onversion from Other Opioids to Butrans : Discontinue all other around- the-clock opioids when Butrans therapy is initiated to reduce potential of precipitated withdrawal.

Consider the use of an alternate analgesic . Limitations of Use: Do not exceed a dose of one 20 mcg/hour Butrans system due to the risk of QTc interval prolongation. Use with caution when prescribing with other medications which increase the QTc interval. dosing of Belbuca buccal strips: For na\u00efve patients : initiate treatment with a 75 mcg film once daily or, if tolerated, every 12 hrs. C onversion from Other Opioids to Belbuca : To reduce the risk of opioid withdrawal, taper patients to no more than 30mg oral morphine equivalent daily before beginning Belbuca. Initial Belbuca dose: Previous Opioid Analgesic Daily Dose (Oral Morphine Equivalent) before taper <30 mg 30-89 mg adequate analgesia for patients requiring greater than 160 mg oral morphine equivalent per day. Consider the use of an alternate analgesic. The maximum daily dose of Belbuca is 900mcg. In itial dosing of Buprenex injectable (IV/IM) formulation: The usual dosage for persons 13 years of age and over is 1 mL buprenorphine hydrochloride injection (0.3 mg buprenorphine) given by deep intramuscular or slow (over at least 2 minutes) intravenous injection at up to 6- hour intervals, as needed. Repeat once (up to 0.3 mg) if required, 30 to 60 minutes after initial dosage, giving consideration to previous dose pharmacokinetics, and thereafter only as needed. I n high- risk patients (e.g., elderly, debilitated, presence of respiratory disease, etc.) and/or in patients where other CNS depressants are present, such as in the immediate postoperative period, the dose should be reduced by approximately one- half. Extra caution should be exercised with the intravenous route of administration, particularly with the initial dose. 40Approved in June 2019; Next Schedu led Update in 2021R eferences B uprenorphine Is a Weak Partial Agonist Opioid Receptor Desensitization Virk M, Arttamanghul S, Birdsong W T , Williams J T.

S ubutex Buprenorphine A guideline for increasing community access to naloxone. On March 15, 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain. These guidelines indicate clinicians should offer naloxone when factors that increase risk for opioid overdose are present, such as history of overdose, history of substance use disorder, higher opioid dosages (50 mg oral morphine equivalents/day), or concurrent benzodiazepine use.^ Nationally, many key stakeholders endorse increasing community access to naloxone, including the CDC, Attorney General, Surgeon General, Food and Drug Administration, World Health Organization, American Medical Association, Ame rican Society of Addiction Medicine, American Public Health Association, National Association of Drug Diversion Investigators, and the Office for National Drug Control Policy. Naloxone may be offered to anyone who feels they are at risk for witnessing a dr ug overdose. Naloxone may be prescribed to patients at increased risk for opioid overdose including: History of addiction, drug abuse, or drug overdose Moderate or high risk of opioid addiction (score of 4 or greater on the Opioid Risk Tool) Long -acting opioid use (sustained or extended -release oral formulation, fentanyl patch, or methadone) Oral morphine equivalents of 50 mg or more per day (50 mg oral hydrocodone/day, 30 mg oral oxycodone/day, 12.5 mg oral hydromorphone/day, ~12 mg oral methadone/day, any strength fentanyl patch) Concurrent opioid and benzodiazepine use There are two ways to offer naloxone: NON -PRESCR IPTION Any patient or non- patient community member may pick up a Naloxone Kit. Kits contain two prefilled naloxone syringes that require a nasal atomizer be affixed prior to administration. Free Kits are available at NYS Dept of Health registered programs found at: http://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/aids/general/resources/oop_directory/index.htm . Some community pharmacies also carry kits for purchase (approximately $60). PRESCRIPTION Patients may pick up a prescription for naloxone at their usual pharmacy.

Unwanted medicines left in the home can endanger others, particularly children, seniors, and pets, and can be subject to drug abuse or accidental ingestion/overdose. Proper disposal of unwanted or expired medications makes a difference for our community and our environment. Safe medication disposal programs have been shown to be the most conve nient, cost -effective, and secure method of disposal. As of 2019, all drug disposal costs for hospitals and pharmacies in New York will be covered by drug manufacturers, as a result of the Senate's \"Drug Take Back Act,\" which was passed July -releases/senates -drug -take -back -act- becomes -law.) Most abused prescription drugs come from family and friends. Pharmaceutical drugs can be just as dangerous as street drugs when taken without a prescription or a doctor's supervision. Most teenagers abusing prescription drugs get them from family and friends - and the home medicine cabinet. Unused prescriptions thrown in the trash can be retrieved and abused or illegally sold. Unused drugs that are flushed contaminate the water supply. Proper disposal of unused drugs save lives and protect the environment. How to dispose of unused/expired medicine Medicine take -back options Consumers and caregivers should remove expired or unused medicines from their home as quickly as possible to help reduce the chance that others may accidentally take or intentionally misuse the unneeded medicine. Medicine take- back options are the preferred way to safely dispose of most types of unneeded medicines. There are generally two kinds of take -back options: periodic events and permanent collection sites Periodic events The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) periodically hosts National Prescription Drug Take -Back events where temporary collection sites are set up in communities nationwide for safe disposal of prescription drugs. A small number of medicines have specific directions to immediately flush them down the toilet when they are no longer needed, and a take -back option is not readily available. Local law enforcement agencies may also sponsor medicine take -back events in your community. Consumers can contact their local waste management authorities to learn abo ut events in their area. Permanent collection sites Another option for consumers and long -term care facilities to dispose of unneeded medicines is to transfer these medicines to DEA -registered collectors, which safely and securely collect and dispose of 45Approved June 2019. Next Scheduled Update in 2021. ph armaceuticals containing controlled substances and other medicines. Authorized permanent collection sites may be in retail pharmacies, hospital or clinic pharmacies, and law enforcement facilities. Some authorized collection sites may also offer mail- back programs or collection receptacles, sometimes called \"drop- boxes,\" to assist consumers in safely disposing of their unused medicines. Visit the DEA's website for more information about drug disposal, National Prescription Drug Take -Back Day events and to locate a DEA -registered collector in their area. To find an authorized collector, call the DEA Office of Diversion Control's Registration Call Center at 1 -800- 882- 9539 in their community. Disposal in the household trash If no take -back programs or DEA -registered collectors are available in your area, and there are no specific disposal instructions in the product package insert, you can also follow these simple steps to dispose of most medicines in the household trash*: Mix medicines (do not crush tablets or capsules) with an unpalatable substance such as dirt, cat litter, or used coffee grounds; Place the mixture in a container such as a sealed plastic bag; Throw the container in your household trash; and Delete all personal information on the prescription label of empty pill bottles or medicine packaging, then dispose of the container. *Other technologies to provide additional options for patients to use to dispose of medicines in thehousehold trash have been developed. Flushing certain poten tially dangerous medicines in the toilet A small number of medicines have specific instructions to immediately flush down the toilet when no longer needed and a take -back option is not readily available. These medicines may be especially harmful and, in some cases, fatal with just one dose if they are used by someone other than the person for whom they were prescribed. But as drug take -back programs and sites increase across the country, these could be options too, if one is readily available.
