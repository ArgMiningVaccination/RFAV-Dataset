A cancer diagnosis elicits strong psychophysiological reactions that characterize stress. Stress is experienced by all patients but is usually not discussed during patient-healthcare professional interaction; thus underdiagnosed, very few are referred to support services. The prevalence of CAM use in patients with history of ca ncer is growing. The purpose of the paper is to review the aspects of cancer-related stress and interventions of commonly used compl ementary and alternative techniques/products for amelioration of cancer-related stress. Feasibility of intervention of sever al CAM techniques and products commonly used by cancer patients and survivors has been established in some cancer populations. E cacy of some CAM techniques and products in reducing stress has been documented as well as stress-related symptoms in patients with cancer such as mindfulness-based stress reduction, yoga,T ai Chi Chuan, acupuncture, energy-based techniques, and physical activity. Much of the research limitations include small studysamples and variety of intervention length and content. E cacy and safety of many CAM techniques and some herbs and vitamin B and D supplements need to be conrmed in further studies using scientic methodology. Several complementary and alternative medicine therapies could be integrated into standard cancer care to ameliorate cancer-related stress. 1. Introduction Cancer-related distress is dened as an \"unpleasant emo- tional experience of a psychological, social, and/or spiritualnature that may interfere with the ability to cope e ectively with cancer, its physical symptoms, and its treatment\" [ 1]. Several factors can cause stress during the cancer experience;a cancer diagnosis itself is a strong stressor associated with\"disbelief, anxiety, depression, \" and disturbances of sleep,appetite, and routine daily activities [ 2]. In addition to uncertainty about the disease and its treatment, there isalso fear of death, disease progression, reduction in qualityof life (QOL) and relationships, a loss of sense of control [3-10], and impacts on decision-making ability and treat- ment compliance [ 1]. Cancer patients experience a broad spectrum of individual and cooccurring symptoms suchas pain, anxiety, depression, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea,wasting, and cognitive impairments, which both promoteand indicate distress [ 11]. Regardless of treatment regi- men, distressing symptoms such as fatigue, insomnia, pain, depression, hot flashes, sexual dysfunction, and cognitive decits frequently occur and often persist following treat-ment [ 12,13]. Overall, a cancer diagnosis creates a vicious and compounding cycle of stress. Although all patients with a history of cancer experience variable level of stress across the continuum of disease [ 1], often information sharing on this topic does not happen dur- ing interaction of patients with their healthcare professionals [1]. The reported prevalence of cancer-related distress is 24-59% depending on the type of cancer [ 10], stage of dis- ease, patient population studied, and study setting [ 14,15]. A recent study of newly diagnosed cases reported distress in about 67% of lung cancer patients and 50% of breast cancer patients [ 16]. Another study found self-reported distress in 25% of cancer outpatients, 59% of patients with advanced2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine cancer undergoing palliative care, and 16% of cancer patients in the general community [ 14]. Psychosocial interventions including experiential-existential group psychotherapy andcognitive-behavioral stress management [ 17-22] have shown positive results in coping with daily stressors. Additionally,pharmacologic treatments for some of the cancer-related psychiatric symptoms are available. Some resources are available in the form of information on its identicationand possible counseling services recommended by variousnational societies and institutions [ 1]. However, only a small percentage of patients with distress are detected andreferred for treatment [ 1]. The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has increased among cancerpatients at the time of diagnosis, during treatment, andeven after treatment is complete [ 23]. The primary reasons for CAM use by cancer patients are pain relief, immune-system boost, symptom management [ 24], and better quality of life [ 25]. However, there are concerns about the use of CAM techniques related to cancer experience since theecacy of several of these techniques/products has not been documented or due to possibility of interaction withtreatment. This paper reviews aspects of cancer-related stressand CAM interventions for the amelioration of stress duringand after the cancer experience. Researchers over time haveused the words \"stress\" and \"distress\" interchangeably, and inthis paper, the term \"stress\" will be used unless the referencedstudy used the word \"distress\" . 2. Neuroendocrine and Immunological Aspects of Stress and Cancer Stress is characterized by psychophysiological processes in response to an event or circumstance that is per-ceived as threatening, harmful, or challenging [ 26]. The hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the sym-pathetic nervous system (SNS) are involved in the physicalstress response. The HPA axis functions through a negativefeedback system: increased cortisol and other glucocorti-coid (GC) of corticotrophin-releasinghormone (CRH) and adrenocorticotropic (ACTH)from the neurons of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland,respectively, leading to a reduction in GC levels ( Figure 1(a) ). A chronic or repeated exposure to a stressor decreases CRH,ACTH, and GC levels [ 27,28] indicating a reduction in negative feedback in the HPA axis. In cancer patients, such dysregulation of the HPA axis and the SNS may be related to the development, maintenance, and recurrence of cancer.For instance, norepinephrine has been linked to the etiologyof cancer [ 29], and epinephrine has been shown to protect against cellular apoptosis in cancer cells [ 30]. In women with metastatic breast cancer, HPA axis dysregulation was char-acterized by increased cortisol levels pituitary gland and thehypothalamus [ 31]. Although a linear relationship between resting cortisol levels and stage of cancer was observed,ACTH levels were normal in both early and late stages [ 31]. Other studies have shown that some cancer patients havea flattened diurnal cortisol rhythm compared to healthycontrols [ 32,33], which is associated with shorter survival times [ 33]. Stressful events like cancer have been shown to lead to increased risk of disease progression and decreasedsurvival [ 34-37], and they can contribute to dysregulation of the immune system, chronic inflammation, and numerous adverse e ects [ 38]. Psychological stress and altered HPA axis function can influence the activity of a variety ofimmune cells, including natural killer (NK) cells, T cells,and macrophages [ 39]. Disrupting the balance of immune cells leads to a chronic proinflammatory cytokine-mediatedcascade of events resulting in enhanced psychological stress,depression, anxiety, fatigue, sleep disturbance, cognitiveimpairments, and ultimately reduced quality of life [ 40-44]. Stress hormones can impair the immune response and mayaect tumor progression and cancer prognosis. Chronically elevated stress hormones shift the balance between the Th1(cellular) and Th2 (humoral) immune responses toward theTh2 response. Expression of Th1 cytokines IFN- and IL- 12 during cytokines IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-13 increase (reviewed in [ 45,46]). These changes are associated with decreased cytotoxic T-lymphocyte and natural killer (NK) cell activity [ 47,48]. Evidence from animal models suggests that these typesof immune deciencies can lead to tumor progression.For example, mice subjected to social isolation stress haddecreased splenic NK cell activity [ 49]. In the same mice, metastasis required less time after tumor cell injection instressed animals than in controls. Stressed animals also didnot respond as well to chemotherapy [ 50]. Stress hormones can also alter cell-signaling pathways, which have been implicated in cancer progression. Manystudies suggest that stress hormones can decrease apoptosisin certain cancer cells through decreased activity of pro-apoptotic caspases-3, 8, and 9 [ 51] and protein BAD [ 52]. Increases in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),which is important for tumor vascularization and survival[53], have been shown in cancer cell culture models as a result of norepinephrine-dependent -adrenoreceptor acti- vation of the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway [ 54-56], and this could be critical in tumor progression. In an animal model ofovarian cancer, psychological stress simultaneously increasedVEGF expression and tumor burden [ 57]. Metastasis relies on tumor cell invasion, which requires proteins that can break down the extracellular matrices ofthe invaded tissues; preliminary evidence of the norepinephrine-stimulated ovarian cell invasionand increased matrix-metalloproteinase- (MMP-)2 and 9expression through activation of the -adrenergic receptor [58] and an increase in MMP-2 and 9 associated with psychological stress in the ovarian cancer mouse model[57]. Thus, it is conceivable that stress management might reduce disease progression and improve quality of life inpatients with cancer. We note that while this is a plausible hypothesis, the evidence supporting it in cancer patients is lacking. Several modalities for stress reduction have shownpromise; use of other options can be considered based onevidence provided by recent research on complementary andalternative medicine (CAM) techniques/products.Evidence-Based Complementary and levels Figure 1: Overview of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis in relation to the stress response in healthy individuals (a) and those with cancer (b).

Complementary and Alternative Medicine Utilization in Cancer CAM has been dened by the National Center for Comple- mentary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) as \"a groupof diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not generally considered part of con- ventional medicine\" [ 59]. Such techniques include mind- body medicine, natural products, nutritional supplemen-tation, manipulative body-based practices, energy-basedtechniques, and traditional medical systems (e.g. and American-Indian). These modalities haverecently been classied as integrative medicine as they arenot an alternative to conventional medicine use; however, forthe purpose of this paper the term CAM will be employed.CAM use has been increasing among cancer patients [ 23] and currently ranges from 22% to 73% [ 60]. Based on 2002 National Health Interview data, 26% of female survivorsand 13.7% of male cancer survivors reported using CAM[61]. A more recent study revealed that 62% of female breast cancer survivors used CAM [ 62]. CAM use in cancer patients is associated with high levels of distress and failureof conventional medicine to meet psychosocial needs [ 63]. Although emotional distress along with other psychologicalindices signicantly predicted CAM use in male and femalesurvivors of colon cancer [ 64], a study of predictors of CAM use in early-stage breast cancer within a year ofdiagnosis suggested that such use may be motivated by theexpected benets and may not necessarily indicate distress or dissatisfaction [ 65]. 4. Mind-Body Medicine Mind-body medicine (MBM) includes a variety of practices that enable the mind to influence body functions. Some ofthe early works in the area of MBM include research ontranscendental meditation (TM) [ 66-69] and application of meditation techniques for stress reduction by Kabat-Zinn[70]; the latter was called mindfulness-based stress reduction(MBSR). MBM is increasingly used by breast cancer patients [71]. A recent study reported that 64.2% of breast cancer patients practiced mind-body techniques following theirdiagnosis, and this usage was associated with Hispanic race,higher education, low income, and other CAM use [ 72]. Research on MBM in cancer has grown in the past decade,although the majority of studies have been conducted inthe breast cancer population. Moreover, studies have used avariety of designs, intervention programs, and measures toevaluate e ects, and most of the research has involved small sample sizes. Larger studies are needed to conrm the e ects of many mind-body techniques on common symptoms ofcancer and its treatment. Several studies in cancer patients have examined the eect of meditation and yoga on quality of life, fatigue, and sleep [ 73-80]. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), a program that includes meditation, yoga postures, andrelaxation [ 81], helps patients understand their personal responses to stress and teaches them how to modify theirresponses. A program of MBSR reported lower levels of total mood disturbance and distress [ 82] as well as signicant improvements in mood, sleep quality, and fatigue in amixed cancer population [ 83]. Other studies using MBSR interventions in cancer patients have shown decreases instress symptoms and cortisol levels and improvements inpatient-reported quality of life [ 74]. A recent randomized controlled trial of a 6-week MBSR program for breast cancersurvivors reported reduced anxiety, depression, and fear ofrecurrence and better perception of physical functioning inthe intervention group [ 78]. Sixteen studies have shown that participation in pro- grams consisting of traditional holistic yoga results instatistically signicant improvements in stress, anxiety,irritability, emotional well-being, sadness, energy, invigo-ration, cognitive function, relaxation, pain, sleep, mood,depression, fatigue, symptom severity, hot flashes, appetite,bowel function, nausea, vomiting, QOL, and tolerance ofcancer treatment [ 73,75,76,84-96]. The yoga interventions typically lasted from 6 to 24 weeks and most often involved4 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine weekly sessions of 75-120 minutes. The types of yoga used in the interventions also varied; the majority of theinterventions used systems of yoga that involved meditation,breathing, gentle yoga, and restorative yoga. These studiesindicate that clinicians and patients are very receptive tostress reduction programs, including yoga, as a treatment modality in traditional cancer centers and that it is feasible to recruit patients and conduct these types of interventionsin a wide variety of communities. A large community-basedtrial of a yoga program in cancer survivors was found toimprove their sleep, fatigue, quality of life [ 97], circadian rhythm, anxiety, and mood [ 98] .S o m es t u d i e so fy o g ah a v e examined its e ects on measures of stress and its physiologic parameters. Y ogic relaxation training has been found toreduce perceived stress after surgery in breast cancer [ 99]; another study of yoga during radiation treatment in breastcancer patients observed a 27% reduction in perceived stressscore [ 84]. A recent study of Iyengar yoga in breast cancer survivors observed reduced morning and evening cortisollevels along with improved fatigue, emotional well-being[73], and vitality and reduced pain [ 96] following eight- and twelve-week interventions. T ai Chi Chuan (TCC) is a form of martial arts used for centuries in China as a health exercise involving aseries of individual movements continuously linked togetherand performed in conjunction with deep breathing andmental concentration. At least 20 prospective, randomized,controlled clinical trials in a number of populations includ-ing the elderly, cardiovascular patients, and patients withchronic diseases have been conducted using TCC [ 100]. TCC as an intervention may provide benets to cancer survivors related to physical deconditioning, cardiovasculardisease risk, and psychological stress. In a randomized,controlled clinical trial conducted by Mustian et al., womenwho completed treatment for breast cancer and receivedTCC demonstrated signicant improvements in functionalcapacity, aerobic capacity, muscular strength and flexibil-ity, self-esteem, bone health, immune function, and QOL[101-106]. Thus, physical activity seems to be an interven- tion capable of reducing anxiety and distress associated withthe cancer experience. Conversely, higher levels of anxietymay reduce the likelihood of participation in physical activityfollowing cancer treatment. Acupuncture, a mind-body technique that is also classi- ed as manipulative body-based technique and energy-basedtechnique, has been shown to ameliorate distress in healthyadults [ 107]. It has also been found to reduce fatigue and distress in patients with advanced breast and ovarian cancer[108]. A recent systematic review of 15 studies of CAM interventions (acupuncture, massage, yoga and relaxation,hypnosis, vitamins, and medical qigong) in cancer-relatedfatigue reported most benets from acupuncture [ 109]. Acupuncture has also been found benecial in cancer-relatedvasomotor symptoms [ 110] and anxiety associated with hot flashes [ 111] and other symptoms associated with cancer such as pain, nausea and vomiting, fatigue that could berelated to stress [ 112]. Another MBM technique, hypnosis, combined with cognitive behavioral therapy prevented theincrease of fatigue in breast cancer patients compared tostandard medical care during radiation therapy [ 113]a n d reduced fatigue in women who underwent lumpectomy forbreast cancer [ 114]. 5. Herbal and Natural Products The use of herbal and natural supplements has dramatically increased over the last ten years. Herbal (or natural)supplements are commonly used to combat stress-relatedsymptoms such as anxiety, depression, insomnia, and fatigue[115-117]. Herbal supplements are one of the three most common forms of CAM used by cancer patients [ 116-119]. In a recent study conducted by MD Anderson Cancer Center,52% of 309 cancer patients reported using one or more formsof CAM modalities, and 26% reported herbal supplementusage [ 118]. Unfortunately, little evidence supports the eectiveness of herbal interventions for long-term reduction in stress [ 115,116]. Sedative herbal and natural supplements have been used since the middle ages to reduce stress and improvequality of life. Herbal supplements are usually ingested as extracts (i.e., tea) or capsules or inhaled as essential oils (i.e., aromatherapy). Commonly used herbal supplements forstress include lemon balm, kava, valerian root, lavender, St.John's wort, and passionflower [ 115-117]. Lemon balm has proven e ective and safe for relieving stress with long-term use [ 116,120-123]. Substantial evidence indicates that kava reduces anxiety and stress; however, it has been implicatedin liver failure and is therefore not clinically recommendedbut may be safe for short-term use in patients with mild tomoderate anxiety [ 115,116,119,122,124,125]. Although valerian is considered safe at low doses for less than onemonth, no clinical evidence supports its use for anxiety ordistress [ 116,121-123,125]; however, combined with lemon balm and kava it has been associated with reduction in stress-related insomnia [ 120,121,125]. Lavender aromatherapy is recommended to relieve anxiety and depression andpromote calmness and positivity, but denitive evidence forecacy is lacking [ 117,123,124]. A randomized controlled trial which combined lavender essential oils with massagein patients with cancer reported reductions in distress,but the study was not able to conclude whether lavenderaromatherapy supplemented the e ects of massage [ 124]. Likewise, passionflower demonstrated a reduction in anxietycompared to oxazepam [ 116,126]. St. John's wort is used mostly for depression and is less popular for treating anxiety and distress [ 116]. Some evidence suggests that Siberian ginseng and European mistletoe may reduce side e ects of cancer treatment and improve quality of life [ 127-129]. Possible mechanisms of some herbals in stress are depicted in Figure 2. Thus patients with high levels of stress could benetfrom herbal supplements [ 116-118,124] but patients should discuss any proposed supplement use with their physician toensure safety. Researchers have studied the e ects of numerous vita- mins, minerals, and dietary supplements on psycholog-ical stress. The most promising include the B vitamins(folic acid, B6 and B12) and vitamin D. However, there is aEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 5 dearth of investigation of the e ects of these compounds on psychological distress in cancer patients, perhaps due to thereluctance of oncologists to prescribe vitamin and mineralsupplementation during treatment, believing that the antiox-idant e ects of these supplements might decrease treatment ecacy. Nevertheless, the few studies available show that vitamin and mineral supplementation administered during treatment do not reduce treatment e cacy [ 130,131]. Following the completion of treatment, cancer survivors usevitamin and mineral supplementation at a higher rate thanthe general population, with 64-81% of cancer survivorsusing supplements compared to approximately 50% of thegeneral population [ 132]. A large amount of the literature reports the e ects of B vitamins (folic acid (B9), pyridoxine (B6), and cobalamins(B12)) on psychological stress, particularly depression. Thereis a biological rationale for the association of B vitaminswith psychological stress. B vitamin deciency can lead toan increase in homocysteine levels [ 133], which is associ- ated with increased depression rates [ 134]. Cross-sectional studies commonly nd that patients with psychologicalstress disorders have decient folic acid levels [ 135-137]. Similar ndings were reported for vitamin B12, with lowlevels seen in patients with psychological distress [ 138- 140]. Evidence from cross-sectional studies also indicates that psychologically stressed patients have low levels ofvitamin B6 [ 141,142], but the evidence is not as strong as for folic acid or vitamin B12. Other studies show thatindividuals decient in B vitamins have a poorer responseto antidepression therapy and higher rates of relapse of depression. Randomized trials have shown that adding folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation to existing treatmentsincreases the e cacy of antidepressant treatment [ 143-145]. Recent research has shown that vitamin D may be involved in psychological well-being. Vitamin D plays acrucial role in brain development and function [ 146,147]. A recent study in bromyalgia patients found a signicantlyhigher rate of vitamin D deciency in patients with anxiety[148]. Other studies have associated vitamin D deciency with cognitive impairment [ 149,150], mood disorders [ 150], and depression [ 148,151]. Vitamin D deciency has also been associated with seasonal a ective disorder (SAD), a condition with depression-like symptoms that occur inwinter, when vitamin D levels are typically at their lowest[152]. Randomized trials also show that vitamin D supple- mentation may ameliorate symptoms of depression [ 151] and SAD [ 153,154]. Thus, research indicates that individuals with low levels of folic acid, vitamin B12, and vitamin D havehigher rates of psychological stress, and limited evidencefrom randomized trials show that supplementation withthese vitamins may improve anxiety, mood disorders, anddepression. 6. Manipulative and Other CAM Therapies Research on massage therapy, a manipulative body-basedtechnique, for stress reduction in cancer populations hasnot provided consistent results [ 164-167]. Polarity Therapy,Reiki, therapeutic touch, healing touch, and Qigong involve manipulation of the body energy elds. Polarity therapy(PT) has been shown to reduce cancer-related fatigue duringradiation treatment [ 168] when compared with modied massage therapy and standard care [ 169]; the potential for its use in management of cancer-related stress can be explored since PT has been shown to decrease stress in caregivers of dementia patients [ 170]. The fact that Reiki ameliorates pain in advanced cancer patients [ 171] and reduces cancer-related fatigue [ 172] may indicate that it can also lower cancer- related stress, although there is no supporting evidence. Thetrials of music in reducing stress in cancer have not yieldedconsistent results; one study in women with metastatic breastcancer showed no signicant di erences in the music therapy led by a therapist and the usual care groups [ 173]. However, one study of music imagery intervention has suggestedreduction of anxiety in adults undergoing chemotherapy,particularly those with lower initial stress levels [ 174]. 7. Exercise Exercise training improves resilience to stress [ 175,176]. A 6-week exercise intervention in patients receivingchemotherapy was found to have benecial e ects on psychological distress [ 177]. Similarly, in postoperative breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, a 12-weekhome-based exercise intervention was found to improvemood disturbance compared to a nonexercise controlgroup [ 178]. Researchers have found that cancer patients who exercised before undergoing treatment for cancer experienced lower levels of anxiety and depression [ 179]. Early-stage breast cancer patients undergoing a 6-weekwalking exercise intervention during radiation treatmentalso noted improvements in anxiety [ 180]. In colorectal cancer survivors, a relationship was established betweenpsychological distress, anxiety, and participation in physicalactivity. Cancer survivors with higher levels of anxiety areless likely to participate in physical activity [ 181]. 8. CAM in Children, Adolescents, and the Elderly with Cancer A recent systematic review estimated that the prevalence of CAM use by children with cancer ranges from 6% to 91%,with signicant variation between studies [ 182]. Children's and adolescents' use of CAM has been linked to parents' use of CAM [ 183,184]. Parents with higher educational backgrounds are more likely to consider [ 185]a n dt o use [ 182] CAM approaches for their children, although no consistent correlations between CAM use and parentalincome, child age, or ethnicity have been reported [ 182]. CAM use and consideration were shown to be positivelyrelated to a lower survival perspective [ 186]a n df e w e r days since relapse [ 185], respectively, suggesting that CAM therapies may be a coping strategy for families in an attemptto try every possible approach for curing or alleviating painand distress in their children. A review by Sencer and Kelly[187] suggests that families' use of CAM may increase their6 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine Cancer/cancer treatment Stress Anxiety Depression Sleep disturbance Fatigue Sedative (inhibit NE; increase serotonin)Antioxidant and/or COX2)GABA Areceptor agonist Figure 2: Mechanisms of herbal supplements for stress. Cancer and cancer treatment a ect a patient's quality of life resulting in various symptoms of stress, such as anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance, and fatigue [ 155]. The human body's response to such stressors involves many di erent mechanistic pathways. This diagram outlines the mechanisms by which herbal supplements reduce stress-related symptoms in cancer patients. The majority of herbal supplements have anti-inflammatory properties, but their primary target of action is di erent. Lavender acts as vascular smooth muscle relaxant phosphorylation and myosin light chain dephosphorylation [156]. Lemon balm is an immune stimulating agent with potent free radical scavenging properties [ 157-159]. Kava and St. Johns's wort function reduce norepinephrine (NE) and increase serotonin levels, similar to antianxiety drugs such as Valerian GABA sedative e ect [ 161,162]. Ginseng and mistletoe are potent anti- inflammatory agents that inhibit NFkB and/or COX2 [ 127,163]. sense of control and active participation in treatment, and therefore open discussion of CAM should be useful forphysicians in building relationships with families and inunderstanding all potential influences on the child's care. The quality of research related to CAM use in pediatric oncology has varied greatly from study to study. Within thepast 10 years, there has been considerable movement towardsmore rigorous research testing, including randomized clini- cal trials conducted through the Children's Oncology Group or other multisite studies [ 188-191]. There is a great need for rigorous safety and e cacy trials, particularly for biologically based therapies [ 188,192]. Research has reported physical and psychological benets from a massage intervention forchildren with various cancers and blood disorders [ 193]; however, another randomized trial of a combined massageand humor intervention found no signicant di erences across groups in children undergoing stem cell transplants[190]. A trial of music video compared to audiotape and usual care in adolescents and young adults undergoing stem-cell transplantation suggested less distress in music groupat 100-day follow-up [ 194]. Thus, several promising CAM therapies are available to help children with cancer to manageemotional and physical distress related to cancer and itstreatment; however, much work is needed to document theirecacy and safety. Aging alone is associated with declines in physical function, including reduction in functional capacity [ 195, 196], reduced muscular strength [ 197], arthralgia [ 198], and reductions in bone mineral density [ 199]. Depression [ 200],anxiety [ 201], and cognitive di culties [ 202] also a ect older adults. Cancer treatments can further exacerbate these age-related declines and stressors. Cancer survivors aged 65 andolder report more limitations in activities of daily living[203], a lower quality of life [ 204], lower self-rated health [204], a greater incidence of frailty [ 203], and higher rates of dementia, depression, falls, incontinence, and osteoporosis[203]. Other stressors in this population include relocation, nancial changes with retirement, caring for grandchildren and/or a spouse, the death of friends and family members,chronic illnesses, and the fear of losing independence[205-208]. Stress is associated with depression in the elderly [209]. Emotional stress is also a potential trigger impairing the mechanisms responsible for balance, increasing the riskof falls that can lead to hip and femur fractures [ 210]. These additional declines in physiological and psychologicalfunction likely exacerbate the stress experienced by oldercancer survivors. Physical activity and social interactions reduce functional decline in the elderly [ 211]. Physical activity is also associated with a reduction in stress and anxiety. The American Collegeof Sports Medicine (ACSM) recommends that older adults,even those with chronic medical conditions, participate inregular aerobic exercise training (150-300 minutes per week)and resistance exercise training (at least 2 days a week)[212]. The exercise prescription for those older adults who are functionally limited should be tailored and progressedgradually [ 213] .T h el i t e r a t u r es u p p o r t st h eu s eo fp h y s i c a l activity in cancer survivors younger than 65, but little hasEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 7 been done to determine the benets of physical activity or other forms of complementary and alternative medicinefor cancer survivors who are 65 years of age and older.Researchers have investigated the benets of T ai Chi Chuanin older adults without a history of cancer, nding thatT ai Chi can reduce depression [ 214], improve self-e cacy [215], improve muscular strength and endurance [ 216], and improve balance and reduce falls [ 217]. Y oga can improve gait [ 218], quality of life [ 219], and depression [ 220] in the elderly. Research is limited concerning the implementationof CAM in older cancer survivors in particular, despiteits promising impact on physiological and psychologicalfunction. Stress in particular has received very little researchfocus in older cancer survivors, but because the benets ofphysical activity are so profound in older adults, it is animportant and promising area of research. 9. Conclusions and Future Directions Cancer-related stress a ects all patients with cancer and negatively impacts cancer outcomes in terms of response totreatment, quality of life, disease progression, and survival indierent phases of their experience. Feasibility of interven- tion with several CAM techniques and products commonlyused by cancer patients and survivors has been establishedin some cancer populations: for example, mind-body tech-niques of meditation, yoga, T ai Chi Chuan, acupuncture,manipulative techniques massage, energy-based polaritytherapy and Reiki, and some natural products. E cacy of some CAM techniques and products in reducing stress and/or stress-related symptoms in patients with cancer hasbeen documented (1) Mindfulness-based stress reduction program with components similar to yoga showed reductionof stress levels in population of breast cancerand prostate cancer patients and improvements inendocrine indices of stress were also reported. Somestudies of yoga intervention have shown signicantstress reduction while some have shown bene-cial e ects on symptoms associated with stress for example, fatigue, sleep disturbances, hot flashes, andquality of life. However, the majority of studies ofyoga were conducted in small samples of patients andthere was a wide range of the length of intervention.This area of mind-body intervention seems to bepromising in cancer; however, lack of uniformity ofthe intervention program in terms of its length andcontent makes it di cult to compare study results. Larger study samples with the use of comparableintervention programs may be more conclusive. (2) Acupuncture can relieve anxiety, fatigue, and distress associated with advanced cancer. (3) Practice of T ai Chi Chuan may be helpful in improv- ing quality of life. (4) Some herbs like lemon balm may be used, long in the term for relieving stress. Most current researchsuggests that patients with high levels of stress benetthe most from herbal supplements; therefore, studies are needed to examine their e cacy as well as safety. (5) Most research on vitamins and supplements con- ducted in noncancer patients show promise in reliev-ing stress; further trials in cancer patients are neededto demonstrate the safety of vitamin B and D sup-plementation in cancer patients receiving treatmentbefore testing their e cacy on psychological stress. (6) Physical activity may be helpful in reducing anxiety and distress in cancer survivors; however, the role ofanxiety in a ecting physical activity should be given consideration while designing intervention studies incancer population. (7) Research on CAM therapies for stress in child- hood cancers is insu cient. Several promising CAM therapies may help children with cancer manageemotional and physical distress related to cancerand its treatment after the safety and utility of such therapies has been established. (8) Stress in older cancer survivors is an important and promising area that is desperately needed to beexamined as older adults are at much greater risk ofdeveloping cancer than young adults. It is especiallyimportant since by the year 2030, 70% of cancerpatients will be elderly. Although some CAM techniques/products could be integrated into cancer care, much more research is neededto conrm their e cacy. Moreover, the wide variety of study designs and types of interventions are an obstacle to reacheective conclusions. Additionally, there is a need to study mechanisms of action of various techniques and productsusing innovative designs such as research on the e ects of CAM on apoptotic and angiogenesis pathways; this maybe helpful in understanding tumor development and itsprogression and applying CAM as a part of personalizedmedicine to ensure cancer-free and better quality of life. CAM is primarily used by cancer patients to relieve disease- and treatment-related side e ects. Although many of the symptoms usually subside after treatment, CAM utiliza-t i o nc o u l dh e l pm a i n t a i nas y m p t o m - f r e ea n dg o o dq u a l i t yof life during cancer treatment. The word \"stress\" cannotbe over emphasized when associated with cancer experience.Stress reported by cancer patients could potentially alerthealthcare providers about the impending negative outcomes of cancer treatments. Most CAM techniques are relatively inexpensive, simple to administer or practice, and encompassthe holistic nature of healing. CAM for stress managementcould restore a patient's sense of control, maintain quality oflife, reduce risk of cancer recurrence, and minimize physicianvisits. The rst prescription following a cancer-related visitwith a healthcare provider may be for stress managementtechnique/product. Further research on CAM and stress canhelp healthcare professionals as well as patients with theirunderstanding of the signicance of safe use of integrativemodes of treatment, better compliance with conventionaltreatment, improve treatment outcomes and survival, andpossibly reduce the risk of recurrence of cancer. Thus, CAM8 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine for stress management could be a critical component of cancer care.
