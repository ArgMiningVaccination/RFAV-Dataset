By comparison, only 20% of NYC's intubated patients recover at all. May 17, 2020. To study oxygen -\u00adozone therapy for Covid -\u00ad19, single and multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trials (involving 800 patients and 26 hospitals) are currently underway in multiple countries including Italy [ 1,2], Spain [3,4], and China [ 5,6,7]. Meanwhile, the Italian Scientific Society of Oxygen -\u00adOzone Therapy (SIOOT) has released 3 reports on hosp italized Covid -\u00ad19 patients in Italy that show extremely promising results for oxygen -\u00adozone therapy [8]. This document compiles these reports. To aid in interpreting the data, contextual informa tion is also included, available from international press interviews of SIOOT's international president, Dr. Marianno Franzini, and others. Background: Oxygen -\u00adozone therapy is a proven, safe antiviral [9, 10]. On March 24, 2020 the research wing of the Italian Ministry of Health, the Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0 (ISS) approved the SIOOT's request to use oxygen -\u00adozone therapy in Italian hospitals for Covid -\u00ad19 patients [ 11]. The SIOOT is responsible for distributing required equipment, training doctors in their protocol, and reporting results to the ISS [ 12,18]. Currently more than 20 hospitals are using oxygen-\u00ad ozone therapy, including in Rome, Milan, Vimercate, Comparative analysis shows promising results: The Italian data reports below show a significantly lower death rate for the oxygen -\u00adozone group and rapid improvement compared to areas where oxygen -\u00adozone therapy is not being utilized, such as NYC. Control data of blood biomarkers in Report 5 (below) also show broad beneficial effects. Businessinsider.com reports that in NYC 80% of intubated patients ultimately die [ 16]. Only 17% of intubated patients on oxygen -\u00adozone therapy died. Similarly, abc7.com reports that NYC's intubated patients average 11 -\u00ad21 days become extubated [ 17]. The oxygen -\u00adozone group's extubates became so in only 5 days on average. According to Dr. Luigi Valdenassi, national president of SIOOT and co -\u00adsigner of the reports with Dr. Marianno Franzini, \"the immediately detectable data is that oxygen ozone therapy, applied with the SIOOT protocol, is 100% effective on Covid patients in Phase 1 and 2, that is before intubation.\" Dr. Franzini added, \"The 7 patients [out of 73 -\u00ad-\u00ad 4 intubated, 3 not] who had an unsuccessful outcome were in very serious condition, with bacterial superinfection, septic shock, pulmonary embolism and myocarditis, to the point that it was not even possible to subject them to the full cycle of oxygen -\u00adozone. [The] 3 [non -\u00adintubated of the 7]...were in such critical condition that there was not even time to take them to intensive care.\" \"This data confirms that, if ozone therapy was practiced on patients who are positive or have symptoms that are in isolation at home, oxygen -\u00adozone...could eradicate the epidemic and safely restart economic activities,\" concluded Dr. Vandenassi [18]. Please note however, as reported by the Wall Street Journal , South Korean doctors believe Covid -\u00ad19 can linger in the body long after symptoms subside, and may take weeks to months to fully clear [ 19]. The last line on the first Italian report below ( Report 3 ) shows that 14% of the o xygen -\u00adozone group test negative on a double swab test after only 5 days of treatments. Report 3 also states, \"[95% of survivors] significantly improved.\" So why didn't they all test negative? It's possible improved -\u00adyet-\u00adstill-\u00adpositive patients are on a path to full recovery. Advanced cases with extensive viral progressio n could take longer. The various international clinical trials are tracking participants for 10 -\u00ad 300 days and may clarify when one can expect the oxygen -\u00adozone group to fully clear the virus. Mechanisms of Action: In a peer -\u00adreviewed article, Dr. Robert R owen and Dr. Howard Robins describe how ozone may inactivate coronavirus by oxidizing the cysteine on its spike proteins, in addition to \"improving blood rheology, oxygen delivery, oxygen utilization, endothelial nitric oxide production, and immune modulat ion via cytokine induction\" [ 20]. Additionally, Dr. Rodolfo Pizzuto Antinoro, a top Italian cardiologist who was Knighted by the Italian Republic explains, \"Covid -\u00ad19 kills because it causes a pulmonary embolism...[for which] forced ventilation has no effect because the peripheral vessels of the lung are closed and oxygen can not go into the blood. ...[So] you have to find a way to oxygenate the blood by bypassing the lungs. This is why major auto -\u00adhemo infusions with ozone [MAH] are made: to ensure that the blood is oxygenated efficiently and abundantly. ...When there is a shortage of oxygen in the blood, it happens that the heart, kidneys and brain enter a suffering condition that can generate irreversible damage.\" Dr. Pizzuto further specified that the therapeutic properties of ozone -\u00adoxygen are known and widely proven by the scientific literature [ 21]. Evidence suggest s oxygen-\u00ad ozone therapy could radically reduce Covid-\u00ad 19 deaths and suffering in as little as one week.
