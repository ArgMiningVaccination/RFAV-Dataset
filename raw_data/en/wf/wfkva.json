And on and on. To some extent, all of these factors may be influencing the situation. But the experts missed one of the most important factors: post-viral fatigue. Simply put, many people have experienced\u2014and continue to experience-profound multi-system fatigue following infection with SARS-CoV-2. As is the case with other viral pathogens, this one can render people profoundly debilitated and, in many cases, unable to return to work. A Widespread Problem I believe the Great Resignation isn't happening because people are lazy; it is happening in large part because many people are burdened with chronic illness. Countless infections can trigger persistent chronic fatigue syndrome or fibromyalgia (CFS/FMS). For example, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Herpes simplex (HSV-1), Lyme disease, and even polio have been implicated. We can now add SARS-CoV-2 to this list. Between 10 to 15% of people who've had Covid-19 develop persistent exhaustion, as part of the syndrome we're now calling Long Covid. Unfortunately, our healthcare system seems to be treating Long Covid in the same way it has always treated CFS/FMS. Essentially, it is \"gaslighting\" people, telling them they are depressed or lazy. Historically, physicians have done this for complex, poorly understood, and time-intensive conditions, especially when they affect women and when they're not easily diagnosed or quickly treated with profitable drugs or procedures. Some examples? Multiple sclerosis used to be called \"hysterical paralysis.\" When I was in medical school, Lupus was still considered a neurosis. With CFS/FMS, patients often go for years without the correct diagnosis or thorough treatment. Too often, their doctors abusively insinuate that, \"since I don't know what's wrong with you, you must be crazy.\" This is now occurring with Long Covid as well. Long Covid carries considerable social stigma. A recent UK study of nearly 900 such patients showed that 95% experienced stigma at least sometimes, and 76% experienced it often. Practitioners may unintentionally contribute to the problem by failing to recognize that CFS/FM is rooted in actual post-viral pathophysiology, leading patients to believe their fatigue is a character flaw. Exhaustion & Insomnia Part of the challenge in treating post-Covid fatigue is that it is seldom an \"all or nothing\" condition, where people are either totally disabled or \"just fine.\" Many are \"walking wounded\", so to speak. They're marginally functional, but far from their pre-Covid energy levels. Despite the fatigue, many have difficulty sleeping. A Cleveland Clinic study just published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine shows that 40% of a cohort of 962 patients with Long Covid have moderate to severe sleep problems. The paradox of chronic exhaustion with insomnia is a typical feature of post-viral FM/CFS. The insomnia, along with brain fog, chronic pain, and weight gain, indicate hypothalamic dysfunction. When someone is overloaded by viral infections, other types of infections, or extreme stress, the hypothalamus basically shuts down and the body loses one of it's key 'circuit-breakers'. This key control center in the brain regulates sleep, along with hormonal and autonomic function. But it's a tricky situation because in the first year after a primary SARS-CoV-2 infection, patients may experience hypersomnolence, which later gives way to insomnia. I've created a simple 10-minute free quiz to help people make a CFS/FMS diagnosis. There's also an easy-to-use one-page checklist for determining if someone meets the American College of Rheumatology's 2016 diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia. Though these tools are for CFS and FM in general, and not specific to Long Covid, they can be helpful in the post-Covid context. The acronym stands for: Sleep, Hormones (and Hypotension), Infections, Nutrition, and Exercise. By addressing these five domains, we can greatly improve the health of people with post-viral CFS. SHINE includes supplements, botanicals, hormonal therapies and in some cases, antivirals, antifungals, antidepressants, and drugs for sleep. Exercise also plays a role. The basic protocol includes a multivitamin, magnesium plus malic acid, melatonin, and a Valerian/Melissa combination. But there are many additional options depending on an individual's test results and clinical history. I've written a number of articles on applying the SHINE protocol at the patient care level. If you're interested in learning how, email me at FatigueDoc@gmail.com Ginseng Revival One herb that I've found to be particularly helpful for CFS/FM is Panax ginseng. For centuries, Ginseng has been one of most popular herbal medicines in Asia, and for good reason: it can be dramatically effective for numerous conditions. The problem is that for wild ginseng, it takes at least 17 years for a plant to mature and to develop high levels of active ginsenosides in response to harsh weather, threats from insects, and other challenges. And since it is the root portion that we use therapeutically, harvesting usually means ending the life of the plant. Decades ago, over-harvesting of wild ginseng led to insane prices (over $700 a pound), encouraged adulterations and substitutions, and essentially drove the plant to the brink of extinction. In response, farmers began cultivating ginseng, but I found that products derived from farmed ginseng just weren't as effective as those from wild plants. Because of this, I stopped using ginseng in my practice over 30 years ago. Recently, cultivators developed a unique and ingenious aquaponic farming technique which reproduces the challenges the plants face in the wild. It results in a form of farmed ginseng, called HRG80TM Red Ginseng, that has the same active phytochemical profile as mature wild plants. Initially skeptical when I first tried it, I was shocked at how effective it was. Enough so, that I decided to do an open-label study using the product with 188 patients with severe post-viral CFS. Prior to treatment, all patients reported that they were functioning at 50% or less of their pre-illness energy levels. They supplemented with 200-400 mg of the HRG80 in capsule form, or 100-200 mg in tablet form, daily for one month. The results speak for themselves: 60% rated themselves as \"improved,\" with 13% rating themselves \"much better\" (p<.001) 67% average increase in energy 44% average increase in overall well-being 48% average improvement in mental clarity 46% average improvement in sleep 33% average decrease in pain 72% average increase in stamina The bottom line is, this unique form of aquaponically-grown red ginseng resulted in marked improvements in people with disabling fatigue, including post-viral fatigue. Of the two delivery forms (capsule or tablet), I prefer the chewable tablets. They contain natural gamma cyclodextrin, which increases absorption almost eightfold. That means, one half to one tablet can be as effective as four capsules. Important Considerations Botanicals like ginseng, and other supplements, can be a big help in recovering from post-viral CFS/FM. But there are many other important things to consider: Consider adrenal fatigue if the person gets irritable when hungry (\"Hangry\"). Give thyroid & reproductive hormone support if symptoms suggest they are needed. Address orthostatic intolerance (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)): This is common. Here's a quick POTS screening method you can do in the office or even have patients do at home. Ask the patient to lie supine quietly for 10 minutes, then check the pulse and blood pressure. Then, ask the patient to stand up and check the pulse and BP again, every two minutes, for 10 minutes. If the pulse goes up by 15 BPM any time during the 10-minute standing period, it is suggestive of orthostatic intolerance. If it goes up 30 BPM or more, it confirms the diagnosis. A drop of more than 10 points in systolic BP is also suggestive. Covid-related CFS/FMS is more likely in people who felt they needed to push through the acute infection phase, instead of resting. It's so important to let patients know that rest is critical when fighting off a viral pathogen\u2014or any bug, for that matter. Metformin may also have a role in preventing Long Covid. According to a large phase 3 treatment trial of 663 overweight people in TheLancet earlier this year, metformin reduced incidence of long Covid by half, if the drug was given within the first four days of acute symptoms. When starting patients on metformin, I begin with 500 mg on the first day, to make sure that nausea or diarrhea are not severe, and then increase the dose to 500 mg twice a day for 4 days. From there, I increase to 500 mg each morning and 1000 mg at bedtime for a total of two weeks. Metformin is especially important for people who already have CFS/FMS, to decrease the risk of a flare.

He is the author of several best-sellers, including From Fatigued to Fantastic!, the Beat Sugar Addiction Now! series, The Fatigue and Fibromyalgia Solution, and the popular free smartphone app Cures A-Z. He is the lead author of 4 studies on effective treatment for CFS/FM. In 1975, an extended bout of post-viral CFS left him homeless. He has dedicated his life to researching and writing about effective treatments for CFS/FM. Dr. Teitelbaum earned his MD from Ohio State University, and recently celebrated his 50th year as a physician. Government agencies and medical organizations have yet to reach consensus on formal definitions of Long Covid, and there is considerable debate about its prevalence and its risk factors. But by any accounting, it is a significant public health problem. According to the World Health Organization, up to 10% of all people who've had Covid have persistent symptoms three months (90 days) or more after acute infection. Roughly 2% still have symptoms at 12 months. The Centers for Disease Control defines Long Covid as the presence of symptoms 30 days post-acute infection. By that definition, one in five US adults have (or have had) Long Covid. Recent reports suggest that incidence may be on the wane. According to a national survey of more than 60,000 individuals by the Census Bureau and the National Center for Health Statistics, the number of Covid patients who report long-term symptoms declined from 35% to 28% between June 2022 and January 2023. That's a positive signal, but on a population basis, the Long Covid numbers are still massive. And official figures may underestimate the problem, because cases only show up in epidemiological databases when practitioners diagnose them and code for them properly. Given that many Long Covid symptoms overlap other disorders, a lot of cases may not be properly logged. A Chaotic Situation There are upwards of 200 distinct symptoms linked with the post-Covid syndrome, and they can affect nearly every organ system. Though sometimes disabling, they're often diffuse and episodic, appearing, disappearing, and reappearing in seemingly random manner. And unlike the acute infection, there is no definitive \"yes or no\" test for Long Covid. In May, the National Institutes of Health published the first data from the Researching Covid to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER) project. Based on records from nearly 10,000 adults, the paper is NIH's first attempt to formally define the post-Covid syndrome, catalog its most common symptoms, identify who's at risk, and provide direction for future clinical guidelines and research projects. On a practical level, though, RECOVER offers little to help practitioners right now. For patients, questions about the formal definition are academic: they simply know that their health cratered after having Covid. They want help, and they have trouble finding it. A Coherent Framework Over the last year, a working group of functional medicine practitioners came together to review the world's literature, compare clinical experiences, and lay groundwork for a comprehensive therapeutic approach to Long Covid. \"The five pathophysiological drivers give us points of orientation for treatment\" The 10-member PVRP working group was directed by OvationLab's Laurie Hofmann, MPH, and included Patrick Hanaway, MD, Kara Parker, MD, Michael Stone, MD, and Kristine Burke, MD. The group defines Long Covid as \"diverse symptoms of new, returning, or ongoing health problems...after an acute Covid infection.\" The protocols they developed are centered around the core observation that there are five main physiological drivers underlying the syndrome and its myriad manifestations: ACE2-mediated tissue damage Viral persistence Chronic inflammation Microbiome dysbiosis Mitochondrial dysfunction These basic processes are inter-related, and often concurrent (Fig.1). For example, ACE2-mediated tissue damage in one or more organs can trigger chronic, systemic inflammation. Likewise, the presence of persistent viral particles drives immune system dysregulation which feeds the inflammatory cascade. All of the above can disrupt the gut microbiome, resulting in dysbiosis, which adds to the symptom burden. \"The five pathophysiological drivers give us points of orientation for treatment,\" says Hanaway, formerly the chief medical education officer of the Institute for Functional Medicine, and founding medical director of the Cleveland Clinic Center for Functional Medicine. He and other Working Group members described the PVRP principles and protocols in a series of three free webinars sponsored by ANDHealth and supported by all of the major functional and integrative medicine education organizations. \"If there's ongoing tissue damage, we can treat it. If there's evidence of viral persistence, can we identify the pathogen or pathogens and focus there. If there's chronic inflammation, we need to define what's out of balance and take steps to rectify that. Same for the microbiome. And then there's supporting the mitochondria. These factors all overlap, you can't just focus on one aspect because they're all inter-related.\" Working group members recognized that Long Covid shares features with other post-viral syndromes, and that exposure to SARS-CoV-2 often reactivates latent sequestered viruses like EBV, Herpes, and Varicella. Though Long Covid has its own unique characteristics, lessons from post-acute EBV, chronic fatigue, other coronavirus-related diseases, and even Lyme disease, have relevance in this context. Who's at Risk? \"We know that people who had more severe SARS CoV-2 infection are more likely to get long Covid,\" says Dr. Hanaway. \"However, we find that about two-thirds of those 2 million-plus people who have Long Covid actually had mild cases of acute SARS CoV-2.\" That's in part because, statistically, far more people had mild versus severe primary infections. The point is, long term problems often develop in people who had mild initial infections. Obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and/or cardiovascular disease raise the risk of Long Covid, as does having a history pre-Covid CFS or other post-viral syndromes. \"If we talk to people and get their clinical histories, we can predict who's going to get Long Covid with 95% accuracy.\" -Patrick Hanaway, MD In 2022, researchers at the Institute for Systems Biology published a study looking at potential predictive factors for Long Covid in a cohort of 309 patients. They identified four factors-type 2 diabetes, presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia, Epstein-Barr virus viremia, and presence of specific auto-antibodies as highly predictive (Su Y, et al. Cell. 2022). They also found that patients with severe post-Covid GI problems, show a unique expansion of cytotoxic T-cells measurable during the acute phase of illness. All that said, roughly one-third of people with Long Covid have no pre-existing conditions or major risk factors at the time of primary infection. Assessing Long Covid There are no definitive tests for Long Covid. The Working Group says practitioners can rule out other potential etiologies and concerns from the following basic lab tests: Complete blood count (with D-dimer; Fibrinogen; high-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein, Vitamin D, Thyroid hormones. Viewed in context of a patient's history and timeline, these tests can tell a lot about the patterns of tissue damage, pathogenic reactivation, inflammatory and autoimmune processes, dysbiosis, and mitochondrial function. Several research groups contend there are distinct \"endotypes\" or \"immunophenotypes\" of Long Covid, identifiable by particular cytokine profiles, autoantibodies, and cellular activation phenotypes. In a landmark 2021 paper, Proal and VanElzakker propose that lab testing can predict which patients will likely have clotting and vascular problems, or impairment of brain and vagal nerve function, or viral reactivations, or Iwasaki and colleagues at Yale School of Medicine showed that by measuring cytokines and markers of cellular activation, they could predict 96% of Long Covid cases in a cohort of 215 individuals. (Klein JB, et al. MedRxiv. 2022). According to the PVRP Working Group, immunophenotyping may be valuable for research, but it is seldom needed for routine patient care. Assessing Functional Status \"If we talk to people and get their clinical histories, we can predict who's going to get Long Covid with 95% accuracy. We don't need all of the sophisticated immunophenotyping. It won't really change what we're going to do,\" says Dr. Hanaway. Lab data needs to be viewed in the context of a patient's symptom patterns and functional status. The PVRP Working Group advocates routine use of the PROMIS-29 (Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System), through which patients can self-assess seven key domains-pain, fatigue, physical function, sleep, anxiety, depression, and social wellbeing\u2014with simple point-rating scales. Make sure to evaluate exercise tolerance, Hanaway added. Movement is vital for restoration of health, but it needs to be carefully tailored to a patient's abilities and functional status. Too much can be as problematic as too little. ACE2-Mediated Tissue Damage All five drivers play a role in the pathogenesis of Long Covid, to varying degrees. But ACE-2 mediated tissue damage is, arguably, the most central to the disease process. SARS-CoV-2 can enter any organ containing tissue that expresses ACE2 receptors. This means the heart, liver, pancreas, kidneys, spleen, brain, and tissues throughout the GI tract are vulnerable to viral invasion, inflammation, and damage. Virally-induced tissue injury leads to immune system dysregulation, which causes further tissue damage. \"It's a feed-forward process,\" says Dr. Hanaway. SARS-CoV-2 can enter any organ containing tissue that expresses ACE2 receptors. This means the heart, liver, pancreas, kidneys, spleen, brain, and tissues throughout the GI tract are vulnerable to viral invasion, inflammation, and damage. According to Harry Crook and colleagues at the Imperial College, London, that simple fact goes a long way in explaining the diversity of Long Covid symptoms (Crook H, et al. BMJ, 2021). (Fig 2). A 2021 study of 201 people following acute Covid showed that 66% had MRI evidence of damage in the heart, liver, pancreas, kidneys, or spleen 4 months after infection. Many had multi-organ involvement (Dennis A, et al. BMJ Open. 2021). In an excellent review article, Malaysian researchers noted that in the brain, the brainstem region shows the highest density of ACE2 receptors. Viral damage to the brainstem worsens acute Covid, and may underlie longer term neurological and cognitive changes (Yong SJ, Infect Dis (Lond). 2021). Neuroinflammation may be triggered directly by the virus, or it may be secondary to generalized systemic inflammation, said Dr. Hanaway. It accounts for many of the common symptoms that patients experience: brain fog, sleep disturbances, chronic distress, and anxiety. The myocardium, which expresses high levels of ACE2, is also vulnerable. In a study of 79 Covid survivors, 29% showed radiological evidence of ventricular remodeling (Moody WE, et al. J Am Soc Echocardiog. 2021). Persistent cardiac symptoms like chest pain, palpitations, and tachycardia are common Long Covid. So far, there is no evidence of long-term sequestration of whole SARS-CoV-2 virus in human tissue. But researchers have identified a number of specific viral protein fragments that hang around long after the acute illness phase. These can trigger and perpetuate inflammatory responses. Treating Long Covid There's no simple \"magic bullet\" treatment for Long Covid. Restoring health in the wake of SARS-CoV-2 requires a carefully-tailored, long-term, multimodal approach that includes diet and lifestyle changes, attention to sleep hygiene and stress mitigation, movement and exercise, and intensive nutritional support. \"Changing lifestyle and helping people optimize it in the post-Covid context is not just about treating the Covid-related symptoms. It's about preventing future harm and future chronic disease,\" said Kara Parker, MD, of Hennepin Healthcare, Minneapolis, who is a member of the Working Group. \"There's no downside to helping people improve their lifestyles.\" During the PVRP webinars, which had several thousand physician attendees, Dr. Parker reviewed the key lifestyle facets of the PVRP: Food & Nutrition: Plant-based, colorful, and minimally processed are the watchwords for good nutrition following Covid. The PVRP nutrition program is built around the Whole30 plant-based program, which Dr. Parker described as \"simple and well-resourced.\" The plan provides patients with grocery guides, shopping lists, meal planning tools, plant-based recipes, and tips for navigating the inevitable the ups and downs of energy levels. Citing a six-country study of nearly 3,000 healthcare workers that looked at the impact of various diet patterns on Covid severity, Dr. Parker noted that those who had plant-based diets prior to infection had a 72% lower rate of hospitalizations and deaths. Those who were primarily plant-based but also included fish had a 50% reduction, compared to those who routinely consumed a lot of meat, processed foods, sugar, alcohol. In general, plant-based diets reduce HbA1c, increase insulin sensitivity, lower total and LDL cholesterol, improve mood and motivation, downregulate inflammation, reduce BMI, and improve the gut microbiome. All of the above will likely improve the health status of someone dealing with long Covid. The Working Group chose Whole30 because it simplifies plant-based nutrition. There's a strictly vegetarian version, and one that includes some animal protein, giving patients the option based on their preferences and nutritional needs. In general, the Working Group advises: Eliminating processed foods and sweetened beverages as much as possible Time-restricted eating, for those who can tolerate it Low-glycemic meals, to reduce post-prandial glucose surges and inflammation Increasing intake of lactofermented foods, to rebuild the microbiome. The exceptions here are patients whose symptoms are suggestive of mast cell dysregulation. Thse patients should avoid foods that trigger histamine release. This includes most fermented foods, aged cheeses, and leftovers of all sorts Increasing intake of herbs and spices for flavor and medicinal effects. For example, rosmarinic acid in rosemary, thyme, and other herbs, can help rebuild depleted ACE2 receptors. \"Sleep Snacks\": Circadian rhythm dysfunction, combined with the neuroinflammation caused by the virus, aka \"Coronasomnia,\" is rampant these days, said Dr. Parker. It can cause blood brain barrier leakage, which creates a feed-forward cycle of more sleep disruption and further circadian dysregulation. \"With sleep, both quantity and quality matter. Any way that we can help patients improve their sleep hygiene and their deep restoration time, will be important.\" One helpful way to do this is to teach patients about ultradian rhythms\u2014the cyclical ebbs and flows of energy that naturally occur over the course of a day\u2014and to work with these cycles rather than fighting them and \"pushing through.\" Periodic \"sleep snacks\" during the day can be extremely helpful for people who don't sleep well at night. Ultradian breaks need not always be full-on naps. Standing and stretching, yoga postures, walking outdoors, non-caffeinated herbal teas, engaging with a friend or pet, drawing, journaling, reading something enjoyable offscreen, or just giving the mind time to wander, can all be highly restorative. Regarding nutraceuticals for sleep, the Working Group recommends melatonin when appropriate. Not only does it help reset circadian rhythms, it prevents peroxidation of cardiolipin in mitochondrial membranes. Given that mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of Long Covid, this effect would have obvious benefit for these patients. Exercise: \"Movement is certainly a pillar of healing from Long Covid. But you have to be careful in how you message this. People know this, and they want to move, but oftentimes they have severe post exertional malaise, or POTS (postural orthostatic tachycardia), or orthostatic hypotension, and movement in the way they used to move is not an option,\" says Dr. Parker. For some, even minor exertion can result in days-long fatigue and symptom relapse. Still, some activity is better than none. The key is to tailor activity to the patient's current energy level, and progress slowly. \"Make goals that are attainable for each patient accommodating the new limitations. Be aware that some patients may feel a lot of grief over the loss of their previously high functional levels. It can be a big, big loss.\" Group Visits: A group visit model enables practitioners to efficiently scale their Long Covid care to help more patients, while simultaneously providing patients with much needed social and emotional support. \"For people experiencing Long Covid to be with other people who understand them, and what they're going through is fantastic,\" says Dr. Parker who's worked with hundreds of patients in groups over the last 3 years. She runs the groups in 7-week series, that includes in-person and virtual visits. The latter, she says are really helpful for these patients, many of whom \"already have a medicalized life, and are often going to lots of visits.\" \"Movement is certainly a pillar of healing from Long Covid. But you have to be careful in how you message this. People know this, and they want to move, but oftentimes they have severe post exertional malaise, or POTS, or orthostatic hypotension, and movement in the way they used to move is not an option,\" -Kara Parker, MD Targeted Supplementation Dietary improvements and other lifestyle changes go a long way in improving someone's general health status post-Covid. But most patients with Long Covid will require a period of intensive supplementation aimed at mitigating the physiological drivers of the condition. In developing their supplement recommendations, the PVRP Working Group made an exhaustive search of the global literature to find safe, evidence-based botanicals and nutraceuticals that would be relevant for and accessible to Long Covid patients. \"We found ourselves needing a curated suite of nutritional product solutions that were targeted at the five main drivers of Long Covid: ACE2 mediated microbiome/dysbiosis,\" said Kristine Burke, MD, a member of the Working Group. \"We're not promoting specific brands necessarily. But the ones on the list, we found data to support the use of each of them to target one or more of the five key drivers,\" she said during the PVRP webinars. The protocols are divided into two sets: Foundational Supplements that include basic vitamins, minerals, omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, and products to optimize mitochondrial function; and \"Specialty\" Supplements, which specifically target the five drivers. \"We found ourselves needing a curated suite of nutritional product solutions that were targeted at the five main drivers of Long Covid: ACE2 mediated microbiome/dysbiosis.\" -Kristine Burke, MD The latter list includes some new and unique products, like Tollovid (Todos Medical)\u2014a compound derived from Lithospermum erythrorhizon, an Asian medicinal plant. It binds the 3CL protease that many RNA viruses produce to cleave their RNA. In so doing, it inhibits viral replication, thus targeting the Viral Persistence driver. Another new product called ITIS (Return Healthy) is a combination of anti-inflammatory herbs including Scutellaria (Skullcap), Curcumin, Boswellia, and others. It is unique in that it crosses the blood-brain barrier, meaning that it will help with the cognitive impairment and mood disturbances often seen in Long Covid. It also mitigates inflammation, reduces pain, and improves joint and muscle function. Dr. Parker says that addition of the PVRP supplement regimens can make a major difference over lifestyle changes alone. \"I've seen this over and over again.\" But it is important to recognize that adherence to this 90-day program requires a strong commitment. \"Supplementation is, in fact, a lifestyle change for many patients.\" Origins of the PVRP OvationLab, a consulting firm focused on developing products, services, protocols, and technologies in the functional and integrative medicine field became the hub of the protocol development process because its leaders\u2014Laurie Hofmann, Tom Blue, and Andie Crosby are well-known and well connected in the functional medicine space, and because they began doing surveys on the impact of Covid early on in the pandemic. Hofmann told Holistic Primary Care that she and her colleagues saw an urgent need for a comprehensive, systematized, \"root cause\" approach to the evaluation and treatment of Long Covid. ANDHealth, a private company that specializes in bundling condition-specific, root-cause care services for chronic disease reversal, played a catalytic role in the evolution of PVRP. ANDHealth launched in 2021 and is funded in part by the venture capital arm of the American Medical Association. It provides its services to patients across the socioeconomic spectrum Ovation and ANDHealth already had a working relationship when, in late 2021, AND provided funding to assemble the Long Covid working group. Early in 2022, the team convened what Hofmann called a \"social listening\" study, analyzing over 1 million social media conversations about Covid and its post-acute sequelae, to find out what people were experiencing, what were their greatest concerns, and what were their biggest unmet needs. Simultaneously, the 10-member clinical working group was gathering and assimilating the scientific literature on the post-Covid syndrome, sharing their own patient care experiences, and studying the prevention and treatment recommendations developed earlier in the pandemic by medical organizations like the Institute for Functional Medicine. From this process emerged the identification of the 5 primary physiologic drivers, a standardized set of outcomes measures, the lifestyle recommendations, and the 90-day treatment protocol which are the basic components of the PVRP. Outcomes Research Research is of paramount importance to Ovation and the members of the Working Group. To that end, the group collaborated with National University of Naturopathic Medicine to establish a REDCap patient registry to track and quantify functional outcomes in cohorts of patients as they progress through the PVRP protocols. Last December, the PVRP group began enrolling its first patients, notably Dr. Parker's group visit patients at Hennepin Healthcare, and from numerous clinical practices around the country. The goal is to evaluate patients at 30, 60, and 90 days into the PVRP program, using the PROMIS-29 and post-Covid Function Scale (PCFS). The initial patient intake process is quite thorough, and gathers complete history, lab values, and timeline information, though Parker said the forms are \"specifically written for people with low energy and brain fog.\" As of April 2023, more than 100 patients have enrolled in the registry, and the first cohort has completed the 90-day treatment protocol. The initial outcomes data will help the Working Group revise and refine the protocols. They will also provide the basis for a series of case studies from the project, the first step toward a full-scale, IRB-approved, controlled clinical trial. From a review of 30 patients with Long Covid (average 15 months) who completed the PVRP at 90 days, there was a 40% improvement in scores on the Post Covid Function Scale. Though the group has accomplished much in the last two years, Hofmann stressed that the PVRP is still in an early stage, and the discovery process is ongoing. The program and the protocols continue to be evaluated and refined. \"Right now, we're still in this phase of trying to understand what continues to be an emerging cluster of more than 200 different symptoms, and how to approach them from a systems medicine perspective. It's a very complicated constellation and, it's still very new. There are no proven therapies, no standards of care, and no clinical outcomes data from the NIH RECOVER initative,\" she told Holistic Primary Care. \"There's a window of opportunity now to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. At the same time, I feel very cautious about touting that we have something too soon. We need to continue enrolling patients in the program and the registry to track outcomes. The Long Covid nutritional protocol developed by the 10-member practitioner working group under the aegis of OvationLab and ANDHealth, is divided into two parts\u2014Foundational Supplements aimed at improving overall health, and Specialty Supplements focused on the five main drivers of Long Covid: ACE2-mediated tissue damage; viral persistence; chronic inflammation; microbiome/dysbiosis. The working group is continually re-evaluating and refining the protocol and dosing schedule. The Foundational Supplement protocol includes: MitoCore (Ortho Molecular Products): a comprehensive multivitamin that also Manganese, and Zinc. The working group recommends 2 caps, twice daily for 90 days. OmegaGenics (Metagenics), a concentrated Omega-3 product containing 710 mg EPA and 290 mg DHA; 1,000 mg twice daily for 90 days. Magnesium Glycinate, 200 mg twice daily for 90 days Co-Enzyme Q10, 200 mg per day, for 90 days Quercetin, 500 mg, twice daily for 90 days Vitamin K2 with D3: Up to 10,000 IU daily, with specific dosing based on each patient's serum levels. If the serum level is below 40 ng/ml, use 10,000 IU. If it's within 40-60 ng/ml, use 5,000IU. If above 60 ng/ml, the patient does not need supplementation. The Specialty Supplement protocol consists of: Arterosil (Calroy Health Sciences): The main constituent in Arterosil is Rhamnan sulfate, a sulfated polysaccharide from two marine algae (Monostroma Latissium and Monostroma Nitidum). Rhamnan sulfate has a similar structure to glycosaminoglycans found in the human endothelial glycocalyx\u2014the thin gel-like layer that coats the luminal surfaces of healthy blood vessels. Glycocalyx damage is one of the earliest steps in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease, and it is a common consequence of Covid. \"In order to have any hope of repairing tissue damage, we need optimized blood flow and optimized vessel health. Arterosil targets the regeneration and repair of the endothelial glycocalyx,\" said Kristine Burke, MD, a co-chair of the PVRP Working Group, during a webinar outlining the protocols. ITIS (Return Healthy): This product is a complex of anti-inflammatory Burke noted that Scutellaria produces a compound called Baikalin that is able to cross the blood-brain barrier, making the product useful for mitigating the cognitive impairment, mood disturbances, and \"brain fog\" that many Long Covid patients experience. That's in addition to the product's capacity to reduce systemic inflammation, one of the main drivers of the post-viral syndrome. Tollovid (Todos Medical): This unique substance is derived from an herb called Lithospermum erthythrorhizon, known colloquially in English as Gromwell root, or Zicao in Traditional Chinese Medicine. \"Tollovid addresses persistent viral infections by blocking viral replication capacity,\" explained Dr. Burke. It does this by binding tightly to the 3CL protease, an enzyme that coronaviruses use to cleave the long polypeptide chains produced from their mRNA during the replication process. Tollovid is among a number of 3CL inhibitors being explored in the Covid context. Essentially, it shuts down the replication process. MegaSporeBiotic (Microbiome Labs): This probiotic product delivers spores from five strains of Bacillus subtilis. PVRP Working Group members believe it is ideally suited to address the marked microbiome alterations associated with Covid and sometimes, Covid vaccination. \"We want to recondition the gut and bring back a healthier microbiome, especially facilitating the resurgence of those species that are important in immune regulation,\" Burke said. Rather than \"seeding\" the gut with exogenous probiotic organisms, the goal of treatment with a spore-based product like this is to shift the microbial ecology so that it favors growth and flourishing of a patient's own endogenous bacterial species. MegaPre (Microbiome Labs): A prebiotic product containing three different types of non-digestible oligosaccharides derived from kiwi fruit, nonGMO corn cobs, and rBST-free cow's milk. Supplementation with this combination increases GI microbial diversity and selectively feeds beneficial organisms like Akkermansia muciniphilia, Faecalibacterium prauznitzii, and various species of Bifidbacteria which, Dr. Burke noted, are often decimated by SARS-CoV-2 infection. \"We found ourselves needing a curated suite of nutritional product solutions that were targeted at the five main drivers of Long Covid: ACE2 mediated microbiome/dysbiosis.\" -Kristine Burke, MD For the first 30 days, in addition to the full array of Foundational supplements, patients should take: Arterosil, 2 caps twice daily; ITIS, 2 caps thrice daily; Tollovid 3 caps 4 times per day; and MegaSpore alone (the prebiotic is added later), 1 cap daily for the first 7 days, and then 2 caps daily until the bottle is finished. From Day 30 to Day 90, patients can cut the doses to: Arterosil 1 cap twice daily; and Tollovid 1 cap twice daily for 30 days. They should eliminate the MegaSpore probiotic, replacing it with the MegaPre oligosaccharide formula, 3 caps per day. All products in the protocols are available as a bundle from Fullscript. Practitioners with Fullscript accounts can prescribe the complete protocols for patients, and Fullscript will deliver the full product suite to their homes, along with detailed implementation instructions. Dr. Burke and members of the Working Group stress that the current protocols, though based on a scientific review of hundreds of potential candidate products, are still a work in progress. The team has established a standardized registry to track outcomes in hundreds of patients now on the protocols, and they will use the data to revise the protocols if necessary. She added that these regimens are flexible. \"There may be some patients for whom we want to add some other tools not on the protocol list. You may choose to add or subtract products. But this is the broadest and simplest set of products and processes that we could develop. We're not promoting specific brands necessarily. But the ones on the list, we found data to support the use of each of them to target one or more of the five key drivers of long Covid.\" Disclosure: ANDHealth and Calroy Health Sciences are clients of OvationLab. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), \"At the biological level, aging results from the impact of the accumulation of a wide variety of molecular and cellular damage over time.\" Age-related functional decline occurs from exposure to physiological and metabolic stressors that cause subsequent epigenetic changes. Overall health depends, in large part, on cellular resilience to these stressors. Research suggests that a critical coenzyme called nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is an important factor in cellular resilience. NAD+ plays an essential role in maintaining healthy mitochondrial and cellular function. It activates DNA repair mechanisms, and helps cells resist the effects of metabolic stressors. The different forms of vitamin B3 serve as NAD+ precursors. While the RDA for vitamin B3 (about 15mg/day) is sufficient to prevent pellagra, it may not be sufficient to support optimal mitochondrial health. Subclinical NAD+ deficiency is hypothesized to be a common factor of aging. In this webinar, Andrew Shao, PhD, shares insight on why and how to boost NAD+ to support cellular energy and healthy aging. You'll discover how achieve NAD+ repletion through supplementation with NAD+ precursors, and why Nicotinamide Riboside (NR) is the most efficient precursor for boosting NAD+ How cells use NAD+ to support energy production and cellular metabolism The factors that disrupt NAD+ homeostasis and deplete the NAD+ pool The importance of NAD+ repletion and the use of NAD+ precursors The properties and functions of Nicotinamide Riboside, a unique form of vitamin B3, and an NAD+ precursor.

Long-haul Covid has unique features, but essentially, it is a variant of post-viral syndrome. That's good news because many of the features of post-viral syndrome are easily treated. Between 20% and 25% of all Covid patients have persistent symptoms of some sort. Those numbers are similar to what we see with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and mononucleosis; roughly 25% of college students who get mono develop chronic fatigue. There are similar patterns with other infections, such as Avian flu. This is just what you see after certain kinds of viruses. Post-Covid symptoms are diverse. For some it's persistent loss of smell, or chronic fatigue and muscle pain. For others its brain fog and cognitive impairment, or chronic respiratory problems. But the \"official\" definition of long-haul is simply any symptom after the acute phase. Everything gets lumped together. That's absurd, because the patterns are not the same. I have been researching post-viral syndromes and working with patients affected by them for the last 45 years. My interest emerged from personal experience: I had post-viral complications back in 1975. The resulting chronic fatigue sidelined me for almost a year during med school. Between 20% and 25% of all Covid patients have persistent symptoms of some sort. Those numbers are similar to what we see with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and mononucleosis. Over the years, I developed a comprehensive approach I call the SHINE Protocol. The acronym stands for: Sleep, Hormones, Infections, Nutrition, and Exercise. By addressing these five domains, we can greatly improve the health of people with post-viral CFS. Much of what we've learned from CFS is applicable to post-Covid patients. SHINE includes supplements, botanicals, hormonal therapies and in some cases, antivirals, antifungals, antidepressants, and drugs for sleep. The basic protocol includes a multivitamin, magnesium plus malic acid, melatonin, and a Valerian/Melissa combination. But there are many additional options depending on an individual's test results and clinical history. When a patient comes in saying, \"I still feel lousy,\" months after Covid, the first step is to characterize the symptom patterns. They typically fall into one of the following patterns: Fatigue, brain fog, achiness, poor non-restorative sleep: This is the majority of long Covid patients. They experience extreme fatigue, yet they don't sleep well. Energy is low; thinking and memory are foggy. Some have muscle pain. This is classic post-viral CFS. The basic SHINE protocol works well here. For post-viral CFS, 91% of people will improve if they follow it closely. Pneumonia, respiratory distress, \"shock lung\": Some patients have long-term respiratory symptoms, especially if they had severe lung involvement during the acute phase. Again, this is not unique to Covid. Other viruses can also trigger shock lung. It usually improves on its own over time, but it can cause a lot of distress. For these patients, I recommend a highly-absorbed form of curcumin, and a reduced glutathione to turn off the inflammation and the oxidative stress. And also, low-dose naltrexone to turn off the microglial activation. Some people experience difficulty breathing in the absence of actual lung damage. A pulse oximeter-available for about $25 on Amazon\u2014is a valuable tool. If someone feels short of breath, but oxygen levels are OK, the problem is likely due to vagal inflammation, not permanent alveolar damage. This occurs in roughly 27% of long-haulers. What happens is the inflamed vagus signals the diaphragm to tighten, causing a sensation of constriction. It's alarming but it does not mean there's an oxygen deficit. An oximeter can assure that oxygen is sufficient despite the sensation. This can avert panic and hyperventilation. Cardiac involvement: If a patient had cardiovascular problems tied to Covid, and shows residual impairment, think about treating with coenzyme Q10, acetyl carnitine, magnesium, and D-ribose. This needs to be coordinated with whatever conventional therapies the patient was prescribed by his/her cardiologist. Here, too, pulse oximetry provides insight. If someone has an oxygen saturation of 93 at rest, and then it drops when they walk, that's a sure sign there is actual cardiac or lung involvement, and not just vagal nerve inflammation. Loss of smell and/or taste: This is a unique feature of Covid. While many patients find that the problem resolves over a few months, for others it persists. These patients will benefit from 25-50 mg of zinc. Smell and taste are highly dependent on zinc, and also vitamin A. These two nutrients work together. For men, I recommend 8,000 IU per day of retinol. That's safe for men, but could potentially cause birth defects if a woman gets pregnant. The minimum RDA for vitamin A is about 3,000 IU for men, and 2,500 IU for women. So, 8,000 is not exactly a megadose. But I don't recommend it for women. Direct Brain involvement: Brain fog often follows Covid, and is part post-viral syndromes in general. If someone has brain fog alone, and not fatigue or other symptoms, it suggests direct brain involvement. In these cases, curcumin, antioxidants, and low-dose naltrexone are helpful. I give 750-1,500 mg of curcumin twice daily, and clinical glutathione twice daily, for 2-3 months. It's like putting out a fire\u2014we have to quench inflammation and oxidative stress. A small number of people have post-Covid encephalopathy, clots, or stroke. For them, conventional medicine is the best way to go. Allostatic Load & Long-Haul Risk Severe stress during the initial viral phase raises the odds of long-haul. If someone is not able to rest while ill with Covid, this also raises risk. It's all about allostatic load\u2014the total stress index. When you get beyond a certain stress level, you trip a hypothalamic circuit-breaker which controls sleep, hormones, and autonomic function. Once you trigger that circuit-breaker, you get CFS and fibromyalgia. Energy drops, you experience insomnia and/or non-restorative sleep. Helping People Sleep Sleep problems are common in post-viral syndromes. In most cases, this is not due to poor sleep hygiene but rather to hypothalamic dysfunction. As a holistic practitioner, you probably have some preferred sleep supplements and herbs that you recommend. I find sustained release melatonin to be helpful. I also formulated a mix of six ingredients (Valerian, Passionflower, Hops, Lemon Balm, 5-HTP, and L-theanine) that can be helpful. There are lots of natural options. Herbs tend to help people stay asleep, but they do not always help people fall asleep. So, many of these patients will need prescription drugs in addition to natural remedies. I use Trazadone (25-50 mg), Cyclobenzaprine (2.0 to 2.5 mg), and Gabapentin (100-300 mg). Zolpidem (Ambien) may also be helpful, at low doses of 5-10 mg. I keep doses low\u2014just enough to get the desired effect. Tiny doses of several things, instead of high doses of one, will create an additive effect without the 'hangover' the next day. It's akin to the traditional Chinese medicine approach of using small amounts of different herbs. This is how it should be with prescription drugs too, especially in this population, because they often have trouble detoxing drugs. Because they're not sleeping well, many of these patients lack energy during the day. Rather than caffeine or pharmaceutical stimulants, I recommend a form of Red Ginseng known as HRG80. It is hydroponically grown, so it is much less expensive than wild Ginseng, and it is very high in active constituents. I take it myself, and I'm very impressed. I studied it in 188 post-viral fatigue patients, 60% of whom improved. There was quite a dramatic increase in energy and stamina. Mitigating Viral Reactivation There are some viruses that the body kills off totally, and others like herpes, chicken pox, and EBV that the body never fully eliminates. The reasons for that are not clear. But when immunity goes down, you see a jailbreak, and these other viruses reactivate. For example, shingles is a jailbreak of the chicken pox virus. It shows up in the skin, and it is very obvious, so mainstream medicine can't ignore it. A similar process happens in other bodily systems, but instead of a big rash, it manifests as fatigue, muscle pain, etc. This is the \"I\" in SHINE\u2014the other residual infections. Reactivation is very real. We need to treat latent infections like candida and other fungi, and latent viruses. If someone has chronic nasal congestion, sinusitis, post-nasal drip, or irritable bowel syndrome, or intense sugar cravings, assume there's chronic candida and treat with Diflucan. If someone has chronic flu-like symptoms, I give Famciclovir (500-750 mg, 3x/d) and plus an NSAID. Celecoxib (Celebrex), it turns out, has antiviral effects. I'm targeting EBV, HSV1, any of the other herpes viruses. Give the combination for 4-6 months. It takes 2-4 months to see effects. By applying therapies that have proven effective in the aftermath of other viral infections, we can go a long way in helping our post-Covid patients recover quickly. -END- Jacob Teitelbaum, MD, is one of the most frequently quoted integrative medical authorities in the world.

As the Omicron blizzard sweeps across the country, so many questions have emerged. My comments here are based on available scientific data and, where indicated, on my clinical experience with the latest surge. Here are a few key points we can safely say we know about the Omicron variant: It is Highly Transmissible: Omicron is so highly contagious that no level of vaccination or prior infection will fully prevent transmission. The vaccines and prior bouts of COVID do help people resist serious illness, but their effect begins to wane after 3 months. Vaccine booster shots, despite the very high antibody levels they produce, begin losing their effectiveness after 10 weeks. The peak of infectivity, as measured by the amount of live virus in nasal swabs, occurs between 3-6 days after the onset of symptoms or the first positive test. The Omicron variant spreads readily outdoors. It does not require prolonged interpersonal contact, and is less impacted by the wearing of face masks or physical distancing than previous variants. Respiratory droplets can travel as far as 27 feet, and may stay airborne for as long as 15 minutes in still air. The CDC now recommends N95 and KN95 masks as masks of choice. Cloth masks alone are not likely to be effective. A study from Japan, not yet published, gives evidence\u2014not just opinion\u2014about the infectivity of the Omicron variant. The data show this: the peak of infectivity, as measured by the amount of live virus in nasal swabs, occurs between 3-6 days after the onset of symptoms or the first positive test. Infectivity probably starts before symptoms, as has been true for other variants. Live viruses persist for 10 days after symptom onset or first positive swab, and then rapidly fall off. The CDC's recent guidelines recommending just 5 days of quarantine are misguided and not based on this new evidence. Please note this in making personal and family decisions. Omicron May Manifest Differently Than Older Variants: Sore throat and stuffed nose are the usual symptoms of infection with Omicron in people who have some degree of COVID immunity. People lacking COVID immunity tend to be much sicker. At this time, if you think you have a cold, there is a 50% chance you have COVID-19. Get tested. Rapid antigen tests may yield false negatives, so if you have symptoms, get a PCR test, and repeat it in 48 hours if the test is negative but symptoms persist. If you test positive, notify anyone and everyone with whom you've been in contact. The exposure is likely to have occurred 4-5 days before the onset of symptoms, and you probably became infectious to others within 48-72 hours after exposure. Omicron May Not be as \"Mild\" as it Seems: The reported decrease in severity of Omicron compared to previous variants may be due to two factors: (a) Most people in the US already have some degree of protective immunity (from prior infection, vaccines, or both), (b) Omicron grows more readily in the upper respiratory passages and less readily in the lungs, when compared to previous variants. This growth pattern decreases the likelihood of severe pneumonia. But it may not decrease the likelihood of neurological problems, including the so-called \"Long COVID\" with its associated cognitive dysfunction. The virus can enter the brain directly from the nose. At this time, if you think you have a cold, there is a 50% chance you have COVID-19. Get tested. Anti-Viral Nasal Sprays Appear to Be Somewhat Protective: Heparin-based products do work to prevent viral attachment, but they need to be used regularly and frequently (about every 4 hours) in situations where exposure might occur. This includes living with someone else who is not as careful as you are. I recommend heparin as a nasal spray taken before and after any type of brief encounter with other people, and every 4 hours during longer encounters. The nasal mucosa is the main portal of entry for the virus into your body. The mucosal cells contain the highest co-concentration of the factors needed for SARS-CoV-2 to enter. The nose acts like an incubator in which the virus multiplies and from which it is inhaled into the lungs. Preventing or limiting viral entry into the nose has the potential to prevent or reduce systemic disease In July 2020 I designed a nasal spray containing low-dose heparin which is produced by compounding pharmacies. The concentration in this spray is 100 units per spray, which should be more than enough to saturate the virus, even when diluted by nasal secretions. At the low dose used, heparin does not kill the virus; but it prevents viral attachment to the lining of the nose. It is safe, simple, and stable. (Read Preventing COVID With Nasal Sprays). Monoclonal Antibodies Do Not Work Well for Omicron: Sotrovimab, the only monoclonal with demonstrated effects against Omicron, is limited in its availability. Pfizer's new anti-viral drug, Paxlovid, which was 89% effective at preventing hospitalization, also has very limited distribution. Paxlovid has a short lifespan in the body, so it is administered with another antiviral called Ritonavir, which interacts with many commonly-prescribed drugs. This makes it unsuitable for many people. Paxlovid works by inhibiting a coronavirus enzyme called 3CL-protease or the main protease. As I discuss in my free online Coronavirus Guidebook, there are many natural products that inhibit 3CL-protease. Among these are the flavonoid quercetin, and the herbs Andrographis paniculata and Houttuynia cordata. Specific protocols are available from my office and have been updated for 2022.
