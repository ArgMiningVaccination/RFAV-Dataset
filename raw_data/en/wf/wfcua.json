Are you someone who loves taking a long bath to soothe away worries and stress? Magical baths are becoming more and more popular in modern spirituality for good reason! Whatever your reason for taking ritual baths, we have the ESSENTIAL guide to spell and spiritual bathing for you here including how-tos, ritual bath recipes, and more. First, What is a Ritual Bath? A ritual bath is a bath taken with a spiritual purpose. Maybe you want to cleanse your aura, heal your heart, or draw money into your life. Ritual baths are effective for these intentions and so much more! Since ancient times, people bathed to clean their bodies but also to purify their spirits. To rid themselves of disease and ward off evil spirits. Water is cleansing, healing, renewing, and refreshing. And when we add things to the water, we boost its magical effects. Water acts as a conduit for spirit and therefore enhances our connection to the universe. Learn more about the power of the [water element here.](https://otherworldlyoracle.com/water-element/) Herbs and Flowers in Ritual Baths When you look up spell baths or spiritual baths online, you'll notice lots of people adding things to their bath water. Herbs and flowers are a favorite. Here are some favorite herbs and flowers to add to your ritual baths: - Rose petals - Chamomile - Rosemary - Peppermint - Lavender - Oats - Dandelion - Jasmine WARNING: Make sure whatever herb or flower you add to your bath doesn't irritate the skin. Try a bit of it on your arm first before bathing yourself in it! This way you'll know if you have an allergy or not. Do your research first. ALSO, pregnant women should be extra cautious of what herbs and oils they're using in their ritual baths. Your health is in your own hands! There are dozens of herbs and plants that can be added to your spiritual baths to enhance the experience, rejuvenate the skin, and cleanse the aura. Don't forget to look up the herbs' magical properties to match your intention. Ritual Bathing: Optional Herbs to Add By Intention: - To Draw Love: Aloe, Apple, Lemon Balm, Basil, Catnip, Chamomile, Chickweed, Gardenia, Ginger, Hemp, Hibiscus, Jasmine, Orange, Papaya, Peach, Pear, Peppermint, Plum, Plumeria, Raspberry, Rose, Rosemary, Rue (be careful - this herb sometimes causes folks a rash), Spearmint, Strawberry, Sugar, Thyme, Vanilla, Violet, Yarrow - Make Money Bath Herbs: Almond, Basil, Orange Bergamot, Blackberry, Chamomile, Clover, Dill, Elder, Fern, Ginger, Honeysuckle, Jasmine, Marjoram, Mint, Oak (3 leaves is plenty!), Orange, Pine, Pineapple, Pomegranate, Rice, Wheat - Cleanse the Aura: Basil, Blueberry, Chamomile, Coconut, Lavender, Lemon, Lemon Verbena, Lotus, Parsley (especially the roots), Peppermint, Rosemary, Rue (again, watch this one for allergy...test first!), Thyme - Uncrossing (ridding yourself of bad luck): Basil, Fern, Garlic, Leek, Mallow, Mint, Mullein, Peach, Pine, Rosemary, Yarrow - Herbs to Mullein, Oak, Thyme - To Bring Peace: Gardenia, Lavender, Passion Flower, Violet - Increase Intuition and Psychic Abilities: Honeysuckle, Lemongrass, Lotus, Mugwort, Peppermint, Rose, Rosemary, Saffron, Star Anise, Thyme, Uva Ursi, Yarrow How do I add flowers and herbs to my bath? There's a few different ways to add flowers and herbs to your ritual baths. One way is to throw the herbs and flowers directly into the tub. But, to be honest, this makes for a messy clean-up and sometimes takes away from the experience of the ritual itself. Yes, it looks pretty on Instagram and social media, but the experience is far more different than pictures online. Trust me. An easier way is to put the herbs and flowers in a muslin bag or teabag and let the herbs steep in the tub...like a big cup of tea! And yet another way to make an herbal ritual bath is by brewing an infusion on the stove first, then adding the strained concoction to your hot bath. Crystals and Stones in Spiritual Baths In addition to adding herbs and flowers to your spell baths, crystals and stones can also lend their magical energy. HOWEVER, just like with herbs, do your research before bathing with crystals. Some crystals and stones dissolve in water and some even have toxic materials that will come off into the water and then onto your skin! It might be safer to set the crystals around the top of the tub instead of in the water with you. The crystals I like to place around the tub include rose quartz, clear quartz, amethyst, and agate. Taking a Spiritual Bath at the Right Time: Moon Phases, Etc. You can take a ritual bath any time you need to; however, when you align your intentions with the moon's phases, ritual baths become SO much more powerful. When powerful cleansing or uncrossing is needed, take a bath on the Waning or New Moon. When you want to attract love or money into your life, bathe on the Full Moon. When you are growing a new business, take a ritual bath on the Waxing Moon. In addition to moon bathing, you can also time your ritual baths with sabbats and certain magical times of the day. If you find yourself more drawn to the sun, consider taking your ritual baths in conjunction with a specific [time of day](https://otherworldlyoracle.com/spell-timing-times-day/), [day of the week](https://otherworldlyoracle.com/magical-days-of-the-week/), month of the year, or even season. All times that are based on the sun's energy instead of the moon. For instance, if you'd like to draw love into your life with a ritual bath, plan to take it on Friday. Friday is Freya's Day, and the magical day of love. Or you can take a ritual bath based on the season. In Autumn, add apples and rosemary to your bath to invoke the elemental energies of Fall. Other Ritual Bath Items and Practices Truly your ritual bath is special because of the thought and effort you put into it! There are so many ways to take a spiritual or spell bath, including dimming the lights and lighting a few candles. Play relaxing music or nature sounds that match your intentions. Salts can be added to the bath for extra purifying effects - epsom salts are popular. Infusing moon water, sun water, or holy water into your bath amplifies the magick, too. Milk and dried [fruits](https://otherworldlyoracle.com/magical-properties-of-fruits/) are also magical ingredients. Some use essential oils in their spiritual baths, though I prefer to leave oils out. There's too many stipulations on what oils are dangerous or not dangerous and in what amounts, etc. Ritual Bath Recipe #1: Spiritual Bath for Money Here's one of our favorite recipes for a spiritual bath for money. Money's not going to pour out of the faucet, but if you do it right, you may see more $$$ in your pocket very soon! Time this ritual bath on the Waxing or Full Moon. Spiritual Bath for Money Ingredients: - A clean bathtub - A quiet atmosphere - A green candle - Handful of mint leaves - Moss agate (4 pieces) Instructions: - Run a hot bath. - Light your green candle and set it near the bathtub. - Turn down the lights and get into a relaxed state of mind. - Add a handful of mint leaves to the tub. - Place your moss agate pieces in the north, east, south and west positions around the tub. - Get into the tub and visualize the mint leaves as dollar bills. The moss agate pieces are glowing bright green like money. - Visualize yourself bathing in a tub of free cash. If you wash yourself, wash from your feet and up to your head - this draws money towards you instead of washing it away. - When you're finished bathing, stand up out of the water and let yourself drip-dry. This allows the magical effects of the spiritual bath for money to seep into your skin and aura. - Thank the universe/the gods and snuff out the candle. - Gather the mint leaves and moss agate in a small bag/sachet. Carry this with you in your purse or wallet.

Hang on your bedroom door. #3 Mother Holle's Healing Well: A Bath for Rest and Regeneration What You'll Need: - A clean bathtub - flowers and flower petals (your choice) - apple bread or pie - a white candle or two - cleansed golden jewelry or clothing OR white clothing - A new moon is best for timing Something to understand before the ritual: Your bathtub and bathroom are playing a symbolic role of Mother Holle's sacred well. The sacred well in pagan (and Christian) times symbolizes the earth's womb. We return to the earth's womb upon death, rest there, and then are reborn. Water in the well (tub) plays the conduit of healing and rebirth. Well-dressing is an ancient custom in which people in Europe decorated sacred wells with flower garlands in honor of the goddesses/spirits and energies there. I recommend reading the full fairy tale Mother Holle, which can be [read here](http://www.authorama.com/grimms-fairy-tales-21.html). This spell is a recreation of the fairy tale and harnesses Mother Holle's regenerative healing gifts to those who are pure of heart and hard working. Instructions: - Before the actual ritual takes place, you're going to set up the sacred space which will be your bathroom or wherever you bathe. Cleanse it with smoke or however way you deem fit. Turn on relaxing music (preferably with no lyrics). Light a few candles. - Next, decorate the bathtub with flowers and flower petals. This is called well-dressing and is an offering to Mother Holle, who resides at the bottom of the well. Set the apple bread/pie closeby, as well. This also serves as an offering to Mother Holle whose sacred symbols include bread and apple. - When everything is ready, undress and turn down the lights. Carry a white candle with you to the tub. As you step in, carefully close your eyes and sink into the water, visualizing yourself descending down into Mother Holle's well. This may seem a bit unnerving to some, but relax and breathe. Feel Mother Holle's healing, earth energy surrounding you. Washing and Drying: Tips and Tricks Everyone has their own personal way of doing things, but here are some tips and tricks when it comes to how you wash and dry yourself during and after a ritual bath. If you want to attract something into your life, wash yourself from foot to head (upwards) to draw things to you. If you want to rid yourself of something, wash from head to foot (downwards). If you're doing a cleansing/uncrossing type of ritual bath, dry yourself from head to foot and FULLY clean out the bathtub. If you're performing a money or love drawing bath or attracting something to you, let yourself drip-dry instead of towel-drying off. Ocean and River Ritual Bathing Don't forget - if you have the ability to bathe in the ocean or river, this is just as powerful if not MORESO than a homemade ritual bath. What better way to cleanse oneself than with the energy of the ocean or river? There's an old custom of going out into the ocean at dawn and allowing the first seven waves that come your way to wash over your head. This is a powerful purification ritual. The salt, waves, and energy of the ocean is powerful enough to wash away all negative vibrations. There's a reason so many religions perform baptisms in rivers. Rivers are bodies of water that typically flow strongly in one direction. In the magical community, spell remnants with intentions that we'd like taken far away from us are sent downriver. When we bathe in the river, we do the same thing for our auras - we allow the funk to run off of us and down the river. Saying goodbye to it forever. We emerge refreshed and anew.
