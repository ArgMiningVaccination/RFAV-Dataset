This document supercedes the relevant sections contained in the 1985 Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Guideline for Handwashing and Environmental Control . 1 Because maximum effectiveness from disinfection and sterilization results from first cleaning and removing organic and inorganic materials, this document also reviews cleaning methods. The chemical disinfectants disc ussed for patient -care equipment include alcohols, glutaraldehyde, iodophors, ortho- phthalaldehyde, peracetic acid, phenolics, quaternary ammonium compounds, and chlorine. The choice of disinfectant, concentration, and exposure time is based on the risk for infection associated with use of the equipment and other factors discussed in this guideline. The sterilization methods discussed include steam sterilization, ethylene oxide (ETO), hydrogen peroxide gas plasma, and liquid peracetic acid. When properly used, these cleaning, disinfection, and sterilization processes can reduce the risk for infection associated with use of invasive and noninvasive medical and surgical devices. However, for these processes to be effective, health -care workers should adhere strictly to the cleaning, disinfection, and sterilization recommendations in this document and to instructions on product labels. In addition to updated recommendations, new topics addressed in this guideline include 1. inact ivation of antibiotic -resistant bacteria, bioterrorist agents, emerging pathogens, and bloodborne pathogens; 2. toxicologic, environmental, and occupational concerns associated with disinfection and sterilization practices; 3. disinfection of patient -care equi pment used in ambulatory settings and home care; 4. new sterilization processes, such as hydrogen peroxide gas plasma and liquid peracetic acid; and 5. disinfection of complex medical instruments (e.g., endoscopes). Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 9 of 163 Introduction In the United States, approximately 46.5 million surgical procedures and even more invasive medical procedures \u2014including approximately 5 million gastrointestinal endoscopies \u2014are performed each year . 2 Each procedure involves contac t by a medical device or surgical instrument with a patient's sterile tissue or mucous membranes. A major risk of all such procedures is the introduction of pathogens that can lead to infection. Failure to properly disinfect or sterilize equipment carries not only risk associated with breach of host barriers but also risk for person- to-person transmission (e.g., hepatitis B virus) and transmission of environmental pathogens (e.g., Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Disinfection and sterilization are essential for ensuring that medical and surgical instruments do not transmit infectious pathogens to patients. Because sterilization of all patient -care items is not necessary, health- care policies must identify, primarily on the basis of the items' intended use, whether cleaning, disinfection, or sterilization is indicated. Multiple studies in many countries have documented lack of compliance with established guidelines for disinfection and sterilization . 3-6 Failure to comply with scientifically -based guidelines has led to numerous outbreaks. 6-12 This guideline presents a pragmatic approach to the judicious selection and proper use of disinfection and sterilization processes; the approach is based on well -designed studies assessing the efficacy (through laboratory investigations) and effectiveness (through clinical studies) of disinfection and sterilization procedures . Methods This guideline resulted from a review of all MEDLINE articles in English listed under the MeSH headings of disinfection or sterilization (focusing on health- care equipment and supplies) from January 1980 through August 2006. References listed in these articles also were reviewed. Selected articles published before 1980 were reviewed and, if still relevant, included in the guideline. The three major peer - reviewed journals in infection control \u2014American Journal of Infection Control, Infection Cont rol and Hospital Epidemiology, and Journal of Hospital Infection\u2014 were searched for relevant articles published from January 1990 through August 2006. Abstracts presented at the annual meetings of the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America and Association for professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology , Inc. during 1997- 2006 also were reviewed; however, abstracts were not used to support the recommendations. Definition of Terms Sterilization describes a process that destroys or eliminates all forms of microbial life and is carried out in health- care facilities by physical or chemical methods. Steam under pressure, dry heat, EtO gas, hydrogen peroxide gas plasma, and liquid chemicals are the principal sterilizing agents used in health- care facilities. Sterilization is intended to convey an absolute meaning; unfortunately, however, some health professionals and the technical and commercial literature refer to \"disinfection\" as \"sterilization\" and items as \"partially sterile.\" When chemicals are used to destroy all forms of microbiologic life, they can be called chemical sterilants. These same germicides used for shorter exposure periods also can be part of the disinfection process (i.e., high- level disinfection). Disinfection describes a process that eliminates many or all pathogenic microorganisms, except bacterial spores, on inanimate objects (Tables 1 and 2). In health- care settings, objects usually are disinfected by liquid chemicals or wet pasteurization. Each of the various factors that affect the efficacy of Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 10 of 163 disinfection can nullify or limit the efficacy of the process. Factors that affect the efficacy of both disinfection and sterilization include prior cleaning of the object; organic and inorganic load present; type and level of microbial contamination; concentration of and exposure time to the germicide; physical nature of the object (e.g., crevices, hinges, and lumens); presence of biofilms; temperature and pH of the disinfection process; and in some cases, relative humidity of the sterilization process (e.g., ethylene oxide). Unlike sterilization, disinfection is not sporicidal. A few disinfectants will kill spores with prolonged exposure times (3- 12 hours); these are called chemical sterilants . At similar concentrations but with shorter exposure periods (e.g., 20 minutes for 2% glutaraldehyde), these same disinfectants will kill all microorganisms except large numbers of bacterial spores; they are called high- level disinfectants . Low- level disinfectants can kill most vegetati ve bacteria, some fungi, and some viruses in a practical period of time ( 10 minutes). Intermediate- level disinfectants might be cidal for mycobacteria, vegetative bacteria, most viruses, and most fungi but do not necessarily kill bacterial spores. Germicides differ markedly, primarily in their antimicrobial spectrum and rapidity of action. Cleaning is the removal of vis ible soil (e.g., organic and inorganic material) from objects and surfaces and normally is accomplished manually or mechanically using water with detergents or enzymatic products. Thorough cleaning is essential before high- level disinfection and sterilizat ion because inorganic and organic materials that remain on the surfaces of instruments interfere with the effectiveness of these processes. Decontamination removes pathogenic microorganisms from objects so they are safe to handle, use, or discard. Terms with the suffix cide or cidal for killing action also are commonly used. For example, a germicide is an agent that can kill microorganisms, particularly pathogenic organisms (\"germs\"). The term germicide includes both antiseptics and disinfectants. Antiseptics are germicides applied to living tissue and skin; disinfectants are antimicrobials applied only to inanimate objects. In general, antiseptics are used only on the skin and not for surface disinfection, and disinfectants are not used for skin antisepsi s because they can injure skin and other tissues. Virucide, fungicide, bactericide, sporicide, and tuberculocide can kill the type of microorganism identified by the prefix. For example, a bactericide is an agent that kills bacteria . 13-18 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 11 of 163 A Rational Approach to Disinfection and Sterilization More than 30 years ago, Earle H. Spaulding devised a rational approach to disinfection and sterilization of patient -care items and equipment.14 This classification scheme is so clear and logical that it has been retained, refined, and successfully used by infection control professionals and others when planning methods for disinfection or sterilization. 1, 13, 15, 17, 19, 20 Spaulding believed the nature of disinfection could be understood readily if instruments and items for patient care were cate gorized as critical, semicritical, and noncritical according to the degree of risk for infection involved in use of the items. The CDC Guideline for Handwashing and Hospital Environmental Control 21, Guidelines for the Prevention of Transmission of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) to Health- Care and Public -Safety Workers22, and Guideline for Environ mental Infection Control in Health- Care Facilities23 employ this terminology. Critical Items Critical items confer a high risk for infection if they are contaminated with any microorganism. Thus, objects that enter sterile tissue or the vascular system must be sterile because any microbial contamination could transmit disease. This category includes surgical instruments, cardiac and urinary catheters, implants, and ultrasound probes used in sterile body cavities. Most of the items in this category should be purchased as sterile or be sterilized with steam if possible. Heat -sensitive objects can be treated with EtO, hydrogen peroxide gas plasma; or if other methods are unsuitable, by liquid chemical sterilants. Germicides categorized as chemical sterilants peracetic 0.2% peracetic acid, and 0.08% peracetic acid with 1.0% hydrogen peroxide. Liquid chemical sterilants reliably produce sterility only if cleaning precedes treatment and if proper guidelines are followed regarding concentration, contact time, temperature, and pH. Semicritical Items Semicritical items contact mucous membranes or nonintact skin. This category includes respiratory therapy and anesthesia equipment, some endoscopes, laryngoscope blades 24, esophageal manometry probes, cystoscopes 25, anorectal manometry catheters, and diaphragm fitting rings. These medical devices should be free from all microorganisms; however, small numbers of bacterial spores are permissible. Intact mucous membranes, such as those of the lungs and the gastrointestinal tract, generally are resistant to infection by common bacterial spores but susceptible to other organisms, such as bacteria, mycobacteria, and viruses. Semicritical items minimally require high- level disinfection using chemical disinfectants. Glutaraldehyde, hydrogen peroxide, ortho- phthalaldehyde, and peracetic acid with hydrogen peroxide are cleared by the Food and Drug A dministration (FDA) and are dependable high- level disinfectants provided the factors influencing germicidal procedures are met (Table 1). When a disinfectant is selected for use with certain patient -care items, the chemical compatibility after extended use with the items to be disinfected also must be considered. High-level disinfection traditionally is defined as complete elimination of all microorganisms in or on an instrument, except for small numbers of bacterial spores. The FDA definition of high- level disinfection is a sterilant used for a shorter contact time to achieve a 6- log10 kill of an appropriate Mycobacterium species. Cleaning followed by high- level disinfection should eliminate enough pathogens to prevent transmission of infection. 26, 27 Laparoscopes and arthroscopes entering sterile tissue ideally should be sterilized between patients. However, in the United States, this equipment sometimes undergoes only high- level disinfection between patients . 28-30 As with flexible endoscopes, these devices can be difficult to clean and high- level disinfect Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 12 of 163 or sterilize because of intricate device design (e.g., long narrow lumens, hinges). Meticulous cleaning must precede any high- level disinfection or sterilization process. Although sterilization is preferred, no reports have been published of outbreaks resulting from high- level disinfection of these scopes when they are properly cleaned and high- level disinfected. Newer models of these instruments can withstand steam sterilization that for critical items would be preferable to high- level disinfection. Rinsing endoscopes and flushing channels with sterile water, filtered water, or tap water will prevent adverse effects associated with disinfectant retained in the endoscope (e.g., disinfectant -induced colitis). Items can be rinsed and flushed using sterile water af ter high- level disinfection to prevent contamination with organisms in tap water, such as nontuberculous mycobacteria, 10, 31, 32 Legionella, 33-35 or gram - negative bacilli such as Pseudomonas . 1, 17, 36 -38 Alternatively , a tapwater or filtered water (0.2 \u00b5 filter) rinse should be followed by an alcohol rinse and forced air drying. 28, 38-40 Forced- air drying markedly reduces bacterial contamination of stored endoscopes, most likely by removing the wet environment favorable for bacterial growth. 39 After rinsing, items should be dried and stored (e.g., packaged) in a manner that protects them from recontamination. Some items that may come in contact with nonintact skin for a brief period of time (i.e., hy drotherapy tanks, bed side rails) are usually considered noncritical surfaces and are disinfected with intermediate- level disinfectants (i.e., phenolic, iodophor, alcohol, chlorine) 23. Since hydrotherapy tanks have been associated with spread of infection, some facilities hav e chosen to disinfect them with recommended levels of chlorine 23, 41. In the past, high- level disinfection was recommended for mout hpieces and spirometry tubing (e.g., glutaraldehyde) but cleaning the interior surfaces of the spirometers was considered unnecessary . 42 This was based on a study that showed that mouthpieces and spirometry tubing become contaminated with microorgani sms but there was no bacterial contamination of the surfaces inside t he spirometers. Filters have been used to prevent contamination of this equipment distal to the filter; such filters and the proximal mouthpiece are changed between patients. Noncritic al Items Noncritical items are those that come in contact with intact skin but not mucous membranes. Intact skin acts as an effective barrier to most microorganisms; therefore, the sterility of items coming in contact with intact skin is \"not critical.\" In this guideline, noncritical items are divided into noncritical patient care items and noncritical environmental surfaces 43, 44. Examples of noncritical patient -care items are bedpans, blood pressure cuffs, crutches and computers 45. In contrast to critical and some semicritical items, mos t noncritical reusable items may be decontaminated where they are used and do not need to be transported to a central processing area. Virtually no risk has been documented for transmission of infectious agents to patients through noncritical items 37 when they are used as noncritical items and do not contact non- intact skin and/or mucous membranes. Table 1 lists several low-level disinfectants that may be used for noncritical items. Most Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) -registered disinfectants have a 10- minute label claim. However, multiple investigators have demonstrated the effectiveness of these disinfectants against vegetative bacteria (e.g., Listeria , Escherichia coli , Mycobac terium tuberculosis ), and viruses (e.g. poliovirus) at exposure times of 30- 60 seconds46-64 Federal law requires all applicable label instructions on EPA -registered products to be followed (e.g., use- dilution, shelf life, storage, material compatibility, safe use, and disposal ). If the user selects exposure conditions (e.g., exposure time) that differ from those on the EPA -registered products label, the user assumes liability for any injuries resulting from off - label use and is potentially subject to enforcement action under Fe deral Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) 65. Noncritcal environmental surfaces include bed rails, some food utensils, bedside tables, patient furniture and floors. Noncritical environmental surfaces frequently touched by hand (e.g., bedside tables, Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 13 of 163 bed rails) potentially could contribute to secondary transmission by contaminating hands of health- care workers or by contacting medical equipment that subsequently contacts patients 13, 46-48, 51, 66, 67. Mops and reusable cleaning cloths are regularly used to achieve low -level disinfection on environmental surfaces. However, they often are not adequa tely cleaned and disinfected, and if the water -disinfectant mixture is not changed regularly (e.g., after every three to four rooms, at no longer than 60- minute intervals), the mopping procedure actually can spread heavy microbial contamination throughout the health- care facility 68. In one study, standard laundering provided acceptable decontamination of heavily contaminated mopheads but chemical disinfection with a phenolic was less effective. 68 Frequent laundering of mops (e.g., daily), therefore, is recommended. Single- use disposable towels impregnated with a disinfectant also can be used for low -level disinfection when spot -cleaning of noncritical surfaces is needed45. Changes in Disinfection and Sterilization Since 1981 The Table in the CDC Guideline for Environmental Control prepared in 1981 as a guide to the appropriate selection and use of disinfectants has undergone several important changes (Table 1).15 First , formaldehyde- alcohol has been deleted as a recommended chemical sterilant or high- level disinfectant because it i s irritating and toxic and not commonly used. Second , several new chemical sterilants have been added, including hydrogen peroxide, peracetic acid 58, 69, 70, and peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide in combination. Third , 3% phenolics and iodophors have been deleted as high- level disinfectants because of their unproven efficacy against bacterial spores, M. tuberculosis, and/or some fungi. 55, 71 Fourth , isopropyl alcohol and ethyl alcohol have been excluded as high- level disinfectants 15 because of their inability to inactivate bacterial spores and because of the inability of isopropyl alcohol to inactivate hydrophilic viruses and 0.075% sodium phenate when diluted) has been deleted as a high- level disinfectant because this product was removed from the marketplace in December 1991 because of a lack of bactericidal activi ty in the presence of organic matter; a lack of fungicidal, tuberculocidal and sporicidal activity; and virucidal activity.49, 55, 56, 71, 73 -79 Sixth , the exposure time required to achieve high- level disinfection has been changed from 10- 30 minutes to 12 minutes or more depending on the FDA -cleared label claim and the scientific literature . 27, 55, 69, 76, 80 -84 A glutaraldehyde and an ortho- phthalaldehyde have an FDA -cleared label claim of 5 minutes w hen used at 35\u00b0 C and 25\u00b0C, respecti vely, in an automated endoscope reprocessor with FDA -cleared capability to maintain the solution at the appropriate temperature. 85 In addition, many new subjects have been added to the guideline. These include inactivation of emerging pathogens, bioterrorist agents, and bloodborne pathogens; toxicologic, environmental, and occupational concerns associated with disinfection and sterilization practices; disinfection of patient -care equipment used in ambulatory and home care; inactivation of antibiotic -resistant bacteria; new sterilization processes, such as hydrogen peroxide gas plasma and liquid peracetic acid; and disinfection of complex medical instruments (e.g., endoscopes). Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 14 of 163 Disinfection of Healthcare Equipment Concerns about Implementing the Spaulding Scheme One problem with implementing the aforementioned scheme is oversimplification. For example, the scheme does not consider problems with reprocessing of complicated medical equipment that often is heat-sensitive or problems of inactivating certain types of infectious agents (e.g., prions, such as Creutzfeldt -Jakob disease [CJD] agent). Thus, in some situations, choosing a method of disinfection remains difficult, even after consideration of the categories of risk to patients. This is true particularly for a few medical devices (e.g., arthroscopes, laparoscopes) in the critical category because of controversy about whether they should be sterilized or high- level disinfected . 28, 86 Heat -stable scopes (e.g., many rigid scopes) should be steam sterilized. Some of these items cannot be steam sterilized because they are heat-sensitive; additionally, sterilization using ethylene oxide (EtO) can be too time- consuming for routine use between patients (new technologies, such as hydrogen peroxide gas plasma and peracetic acid reprocessor, provide faster cycle times). However, evidence that sterilization of these items improves patient care by reducing the infect ion risk is lacking29, 87-91. Many newer models of these instruments can withstand steam sterilization, which for critical items is the preferred method. Another problem with implementing the Spaulding scheme is processing of an instrument in the semicritical category (e.g., endoscope) that would be used in conjunction with a critical instrument that contacts sterile body tissues. For example, is an endoscope used for upper gastrointestinal tract investigation still a semicritical item when used with sterile biopsy forceps or in a patient who is bleeding heavily from esophageal varices? Provided that high- level disinfection is achieved, and all microorganisms except bacterial spores have been removed from the endoscope, the device should not represent an infection risk and should r emain in the semicritical category 92-94 . Infection with spore- forming bacteria has not been reported from appropriately high- level disinfected endoscopes. An additional problem with implementation of the Spaulding system is that the optimal contact time for high-level disinfection has not been defined or varies among professional organizations, resulting in different strategies for disinfecting different types of semicritical items (e.g., endoscopes, applanation tonometers, endocavitary transducers, cryosurgical instruments, and diaphragm fitting rings). Until simpler and effective alternatives are identified for device disinfection in clinical settings, following this guideline, other CDC guidelines 1, 22, 95, 96 and FDA -cleared instructions for the liquid chemi cal sterilants/high- level disinfectants would be prudent. Reprocessing of Endoscopes Physicians use endoscopes to diagnose and treat numerous medical disorders. Even though endoscopes represent a valuable diagnostic and therapeutic tool in modern medicine and the incidence of infection associated with their use reportedly is very low (abou t 1 in 1.8 million procedures) 97, more healthcare -associated outbreaks have been linked to contaminated endoscopes than to any other medical device 6-8, 12, 98. To prevent the spread of health- care- associated infections, endoscopes, bronchoscopes, nasopharygoscopes) must be properly cleaned and, at a minimum, subjected to high- level disinfection after each use. High- level disinfection can be expected to destroy all microorganisms, although when high numbers of bact erial spores are present, a few spores might survive. Because of the types of body cavities they enter, flexible endoscopes acquire high levels of microbial contamination (bioburden) during each use 99. For example, the bioburden found on flexible gastrointestinal endoscopes after use has ranged from 105 colony forming units (CFU)/mL to 1010 CFU/mL, with the highest levels found in the suction channels 99-102. The average load on bronchoscopes before cleaning was 6.4x104 CFU/mL. Cleaning reduces th e level of microbial contamination by 4- 6 log 10 83, 103. Using human immunovirus (HIV) -contaminated endoscopes, several investigators have shown that cleaning completely eliminates the microbial contaminati on on the scopes 104, 105. Similarly, other investigators found that EtO sterilization or soaking in 2% glutaraldehyde for 20 minutes was effective only when the device first was properly cleaned 106. Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 15 of 163 FDA maintains a list of cleared liquid chemical sterilants and high- level disinfectants that can be used to reprocess heat -sensitive medical devices, such as flexible endoscopes [This link is no longer active: http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/germlab.html. The current version of this document may differ from original version: FDA-Cleared Sterilants and High Level Disinfectants with General Claims for Processing Reusable Medical and Dental Devices - Marc h 2015 ] (http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/ReprocessingofReusableMedicalDevi ces/ucm437347.htm ). At this time, the with 0.08% perac etic acid, and 7.5% hydrogen peroxide 85. These products have excellent antimicrobial activity; however, some oxidizing chemicals (e.g., 7.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 1.0% hydrogen peroxide with 0.08% peracetic acid [latter product is no longer marketed]) reportedly have caused cosmetic and functional damage to endoscopes 69. Users should check with device manufacturers for information about germicide compatibility with their device. If the germicide is FDA -cleared, then it is safe when used according to label directions; however, professionals should review the scientific literature for newly available data regarding human safety or materials compatibility. EtO sterilization of flexible endoscopes is infrequent because it requires a lengthy processing and aeration time (e.g., 12 hours) and is a potential haz ard to staff and patients. The two products most commonly used for reprocessing endoscopes in the United States are glutaraldehyde and an automated, liquid chemical sterilization process that uses peracetic acid 107. The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) recomm ends glutaraldehyde solutions that do not contain surfactants because the soapy residues of surfactants are difficult to remove during rinsing 108. ortho- phthalaldehyde has begun to replace glutaraldehyde in many health- care facilities because it has several potential advantages over glutaraldehyde: is not known to irritate the eyes and nasal passages, does not require activation or exposure monitoring, and has a 12- minute high- level disinfection claim in the United States 69. Disinfectants that are not FDA -cleared and should not be used for reprocessing endoscopes include iodophors, chlorine solutions, alcohols, quaternary ammonium compounds, and phenolics. These solutions might still be in use outside the United States, but their use should be strongly discouraged because of lack of proven efficacy against all microorganisms or materials incompatibility. FDA clearance of the contact conditions listed on germicide labeling is based on the manufacturer's test results [This link is no longer active: http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/germ lab.html. The current version of this document may differ from original version: FDA-Cleared Sterilants and High Level Disinfect ants with General Claims for Processing Reusable Medical and Dental Devices - March 2015 (http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/ReprocessingofReusableMedicalDevi ces/ucm437347.htm) ]. Manufacturers test the product under worst -case co nditions for germicide formulation (i.e., minimum recommended concentration of the active ingredient), and include organic soil. Typically manufacturers use 5% serum as the organic soil and hard water as examples of organic and inorganic challenges. The soil represents the organic loading to which the device is exposed during actual use and that would remain on the device in the absence of cleaning. This method ensures that the contact conditions completely eliminate the test mycobacteria (e.g., 105 to 106 Mycobacteria tuberculosis in organic soil and dried on a scope) if inoculated in the most difficult areas for the disinfectant to penetrate and contact in the absence of cleaning and thus provides a margin of safety 109. For 2.4% glutaraldehyde that requires a 45- minute immersion at 25\u00baC to achieve high- level disinfection (i.e., 100% kill of M. tuberculosis ). FDA itself does not conduct testing but relies solely on the disinfectant manufacturer's data. Data suggest that M. tuberculosis levels can be reduced by at least 8 log 10 with cleaning (4 log 10) 83, 101, 102, 110, followed by chemical disinfection for 20 mi nutes at 20\u00b0C (4 to 6 log 10) 83, 93, 111, 112. On the basis of these data, APIC 113, the Society of Gastroenterology Nurses and Associates (SGNA) 38, 114, 115, the ASGE 108, Ameri can College of Chest Physicians 12, and a multi -society guideline 116 recommend alternative contact conditions with 2% glutaraldehyde to achieve high- level disinfection (e.g., that equipment be immersed in 2% glutaraldehyde at 20\u00b0C for at least 20 minutes for high- level disinfection) . Federal regulations are to follow the FDA -cleared label claim for high- level disinfectants. The FDA -cleared labels for high- level disinfection with >2% glutaraldehyde at 25\u00b0C range from 20- 90 minutes, depending upon the product based on three tier testing which includes AOAC sporicidal tests, simulated use testing with mycobacterial and in- use testing. The studies supporting the efficacy of >2% glutaraldehyde for 20 minutes at 20\u00baC assume adequate cleaning prior to disinfection, whereas the FDA -cleared label claim incorporates an Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 16 of 163 added margin of safety to accommodate possible lapses in cleaning practices. Facilities that have chosen to apply the 20 minute duration at 20\u00baC have done so based on the IA recommendation in the July 2003 SHEA position paper, \" Multi- society Guideline for Reprocessing Flexible Gastrointestinal Endoscopes\"19, 57, 83, 94, 108, 111, 116 -121. Flexible GI Endoscope Reprocessing Update [June 2011] : are particularly difficult to disinfect 122 and easy to damage because of their intricate design and delicate materials. 123 Meticulous cleaning must precede any sterilization or high- level disinfection of these instruments. Failure to perform good cleaning can result in sterilization or disinfection failure, and outbreaks of infection can occur. Several studies have demonstrated the importance of cleaning in experimental studies with the duck hepatitis B virus (HBV) 106, 124, HIV 125and Helicobacter pylori . 126 An examination of health- care- associated infections related only to endoscopes through July 1992 found 281 infections transmitted by gastrointestinal endoscopy and 96 transmitted by bronchoscopy. The clinical spectrum ranged from asymptomatic colonization to death. Salmonella species and Pseudomonas aeruginosa repeatedly were identified as causative agents of infections transmitted by gastrointestinal endoscopy, and M. tuberculosis , atypical mycobacteria, and P. aeruginosa were the most common causes of infections transmitted by bronchoscopy 12. Major reasons for transmission were inadequate cleaning, improper selection of a disinfecting agent, and failure to follow recommended cleaning and disinfection procedures 6, 8, 37, 98, and flaws in endoscope design 127, 128 or automated endoscope reprocessors. 7, 98 Failure to follow establ ished guidelines has continued to result in infections associated with gastrointestinal endoscopes 8 and bronchoscopes 7, 12. Potential device- associated problems should be reported to the FDA Center for Devices and Radiologic Health. One multistate investigation found that 23.9% of the bacterial cultures from the internal channels of 71 gastrointestinal endoscopes grew 100,000 colonies of bacteria after completion of all disinfection and sterilization procedures (nine of 25 facilities were using a product that has been removed from the marketplace [six facilities using 1:16 glutaraldehyde phenate], is not FDA -cleared as a high- level disinfectant [an iodophor] or no disinfecting agent) and before use on the next patient129. The incidence of postendoscopic procedure infections from an improperly processed endoscope has not been rigorously assessed. Automated endoscope reprocessors (AER) offer several advantages over manual reprocessing: they automate and standardize several important reprocessing steps130-132, reduce the likelihood that an essential reprocessing step will be skipped, and reduce personnel exposure to high- level disinfectants or chemical sterilants. Failure of AERs has been linked to outbreaks of infections 133 or colonization 7, 134, and the AER water filtration system might not be able to reliably provide \"sterile\" or bacteria- free rinse water135, 136. Establishment of correct connectors between the AER and the device is critical to ensure complete flow of disinfectants and rinse water 7, 137. In addition, some endoscopes such as the duodenoscopes (e.g., endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography [ERCP]) contain features (e.g., elevator -wire channel) that require a flushing pressure that is not achieved by most AERs and must be reprocessed manually using a 2- to 5-mL syringe, until new duodenoscopes equipped with a wider elevator -channel that AERs can reliably reprocess become available 132. Outbreaks involving removable endoscope parts 138, 139 such as suction valves and endoscopic accessories designed to be inserted through flexible endoscopes such as biopsy forceps emphasize the importance of cleaning to remove all foreign matter before high- level disinfection or sterilization. 140 Some types of val ves are now available as single- use, disposable products (e.g., bronchoscope valves) or steam sterilizable products (e.g., gastrointestinal endoscope valves). AERs need further development and redesign 7, 141, as do endoscopes 123, 142, so that they do not represent a potential source of infectious agents. Endoscopes employing disposable components (e.g ., protective barrier devices or sheaths) might provide an alternative to conventional liquid chemical high- level disinfection/sterilization143, 144. Another new technology is a swallowable camera- in-a-capsule that travels through the digestive tract and transmits color pictures of the small intestine to a receiver worn outside the body. This capsule currently does not replace colonoscopi es. Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 17 of 163 Published recommendations for cleaning and disinfecting endoscopic equipment should be strictly followed 12, 38, 108, 113 -116, 145 -148. Unfortunately, audits have shown that personnel do not consistently adhere to guidelines on reprocessing 149-151 and outbreaks of infection continue to occur. 152-154 To ensure reprocessing personnel are properly trained, each person who reprocesses endoscopic instruments should receive initial a nd annual competency testing 38, 155. In general, endoscope disinfection or sterilization with a liquid chemical sterilant inv olves five steps after leak testing: 1. Clean: mechanically clean internal and external surfaces, including brushing internal channels and flushing each internal channel with water and a detergent or enzymatic cleaners (leak testing is recommended for endosc opes before immersion). 2. Disinfect: immerse endoscope in high- level disinfectant (or chemical sterilant) and perfuse (eliminates air pockets and ensures contact of the germicide with the internal channels) disinfectant into all accessible channels, such as the suction/biopsy channel and air/water channel and expose for a time recommended for specific products. 3. Rinse: rinse the endoscope and all channels with sterile water, filtered water (commonly used with AERs) or tap water (i.e., high- quality potable water that meets federal clean water standards at the point of use). 4. Dry: rinse the insertion tube and inner channels with alcohol, and dry with forced air after disinfection and before storage. 5. Store: store the endoscope in a way that prevents recontamination and promotes drying (e.g., hung vertically). Drying the endoscope (steps 3 and 4) is essential to greatly reduce the chance of recontamination of the endoscope by microorganisms that can be present in the rinse water 116, 156. One study demonstrated that reprocessed endoscopes (i.e., air/water channel, suction/biopsy channel) generally were negative after 24 hours; 90% after 7 days [1 CFU of coagulase- negative Staphylococcus in one channel]) for bacterial growth when stored by hanging vertically in a ventilated cabinet157. Other investigators found all endoscopes were bacteria- free immediately after high- level disinfection, and only four of 135 scopes were positive during the subsequent 5- day assessment (skin bacteria cultured from endoscope surfaces). All flush -through samples remained sterile 158. Because tapwater can contain low levels of microorganisms159, some researchers have suggested that only sterile water (which can be prohibitively expensive) 160 or AER filtered water be used. The suggestion to use only sterile water or fil tered water is not consistent with published guidelines that allow tapwater with an alcohol rinse and forced air -drying 38, 108, 113 or the scientific literature. 39, 93 In addition, no evidence of disease transmission has been found when a tap water rinse is followed by an alcohol rinse and forced- air drying. AERs produce filtered water by passage through a bacterial filter (e.g., 0.2 \u00b5). Filtered rinse water was identified as a source of bacterial contamination in a study that cultured the accessory and suction channels of endoscopes and the internal chambers of AERs during 1996 -2001 and reported 8.7% of samples collected during 1996 -1998 had bact erial growth, with 54% being Pseudomonas species . After a system of hot water flushing of the piping (60\u00baC for 60 minutes daily) was introduced, the frequency of positive cultures fell to approximately 2% with only rare isolation of >10 CFU/mL 161. In addition to the endoscope repr ocessing steps, a protocol should be developed that ensures the user knows whether an endoscope has been appropriately cleaned and disinfected (e.g., using a room or cabinet for processed endoscopes only) or has not been reprocessed. When users leave endos copes on movable carts, confusion can result about whether the endoscope has been processed. Although one guideline recommended endoscopes (e.g., duodenoscopes) be reprocessed immediately before use 147, other guidelines do not require this activity 38, 108, 115 and except for the Association of periOperative Registered Nurses (AORN), professional organizations do not recommended that reprocessing be repeated as long as the original processing is done correctly. As part of a quality assurance program, healthcare facility personnel can consider random bacterial surveillance cul tures of processed endoscopes to ensure high- level disinfection or sterilization7, 162-164 . Reprocessed endoscopes should be free of microbial pathogens except for small numbers of relatively avirulent microbes that represent exogenous environmental contamination (e.g., coagulase- negative Staphylococcus , Bacillus species , diphtheroids). Although recommendations exist for the final rinse water used during endoscope Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 18 of 163 reprocessing to be microbiologically cultured at least monthly 165, a microbiologic standar d has not been set, and the value of routine endoscope cultures has not been shown 166. In addition, neither the routine culture of reprocessed endoscopes nor the final rinse water has been validated by correlating viable counts on an endoscope to infection after an endoscopic procedure. If reprocessed endoscopes were cultured, sampling the endoscope would assess water quality and other important steps (e.g., disinfectant effectiveness, exposure time, cleaning) in the reprocessing procedure. A number of methods for sampling endoscopes and water have be en described 23, 157, 161, 163, 167, 168. Novel approaches (e.g., detection of adenosine triphosphate [ATP]) to evaluate the effectivenes s of endoscope cleaning 169, 170 or endoscope reprocessing 171 also have been evaluated, but no method has been established as a standard for assessing the outcome of endoscope reprocessing. The carrying case used to transport clean and reprocessed endoscopes outside the health- care environment should not be used to store an endoscope or to transport the instrument within the health- care facility. A contaminated endoscope should never be placed in the carrying case because the case can also become contaminated. When the endoscope is removed from the case, properly reprocessed, and put back in the case, the case could recontaminate the endoscope. A contaminated carrying case should be discarded (Olympus America, June 2002, written communication). Infection- control professionals should ensure that institutional policies are consistent with national guidelines and conduct infection- control rounds periodically (e.g., at least annually) in areas where endoscopes are reprocessed to ensure policy complia nce. Breaches in policy should be documented and corrective action instituted. In incidents in which endoscopes were not exposed to a high- level disinfection process, patients exposed to potentially contaminated endoscopes have been assessed for possible acquisition of HIV, HBV, and hepatitis C virus (HCV). A 14- step method for managing a failure incident associated with high- level disinfection or sterilization has been described [Rutala WA, 2006 #12512] . The possible transmission of bloodborne and other infectious agents highlights the importanc e of rigorous infection control172, 173. Laparoscopes and Arthroscopes Although high- level disinfection appears to be the minimum standard for processing laparoscopes and arthroscopes between patients 28, 86, 174, 175, this practice continues to be debated 89, 90, 176. However, neither side in the high- level disinfection versus sterilization debate has sufficient data on which to base its conclusions. Proponents of high- level disinfection refer to membership surveys 29 or institutional experiences 87 involving more than 117,000 and 10,000 laparoscopic procedures, respectively, that cite a low risk for infection (<0.3%) when high- level disinfection is used for gynecologic lapar oscopic equipment. Only one infection in the membership survey was linked to spores. In addition, growth of common skin microorganisms (e.g., Staphylococcus epidermidis , diphtheroids) has been documented from the umbilical area even after skin preparation with povidone- iodine and ethyl alcohol. Similar organisms were recovered in some instances from the pelvic serosal surfaces or from the laparoscopic telescopes, suggesting that the microorganisms probably were carried from the skin into the peritoneal cavi ty 177, 178. Proponents of sterilization focus on the possibility of transmitting infection by spore- forming organisms. Researchers have proposed several reasons why sterility was not necessary for all laparoscopic equipment: only a limited number of organisms (usually 10) are introduced into the peritoneal cavity during laparoscopy; minimal damage is done to inner abdominal structures with little devitalized tissue; the peritoneal cavity tolerates small numbers of spore- forming bacteria; equipment is simple to clean and disinfect; surgical sterility is relative; the natural bioburden on rigi d lumened devices is low179; and no evidence exists that high- level disinfection instead of sterilization increases the risk for infection 87, 89, 90. With the advent of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, concern about high- level disinfection is justifiable because the degree of tissue damage and bacterial contamination is greater than with laparoscopic procedures in gynecology. Failure to completely dissemble, clean, and high- level disinfect laparoscope parts has led to infections in patients180. Data from one study suggested that disassembly, cleaning, and proper re assembly of laparoscopic equipment used in gynecologic procedures before steam sterilization presents no risk for infection181. Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 19 of 163 As with laparoscopes and other equipment that enter sterile bod y sites, arthroscopes ideally should be sterilized before used. Older studies demonstrated that these instruments were commonly (57%) only high-level disinfected in the United States 28, 86. A later survey (with a response rate of only 5%) reported that high- level disinfection was used by 31% and a sterilization process in the remainder of the health- care facilities30 High-level disinfection rather than sterilization presumably has been used because the incidence of i nfection is low and the few infections identified probably are unrelated to the use of high- level disinfection rather than sterilization. A retrospective study of 12,505 arthroscopic procedures found an infection rate of 0.04% (five infections) when arthroscopes were soaked in 2% glutaraldehyde for 15- 20 minutes. Four infections were caused by S. aureus ; the fifth was an anaerobic streptococcal infection 88. Because these organisms are very susceptible to high- level disinfectants, such as 2% glutaraldehyde, the infections most likely originated from the patient's skin. Two cases of Clostridium perfringens arthritis have been reported when the arthroscope was disinfected with glutaraldehyde for an exposure time that is not effective against spores 182, 183. Although only limited data are available, the evidence does not demonstrate that high- level disinfection of arthroscopes and laparoscopes poses an infection risk to the patient. For example, a prospective study that compared the reprocessing of arthroscopes and laparoscopes (per 1,000 procedures) with EtO sterilization to high- level disinfection with glutaraldehyde found no statistically significant difference in infection risk between the two methods (i.e., EtO, 7.5/1,000 procedures; glutaraldehyde, 2.5/1,000 procedures)89. Although the debate for high- level disinfection versus sterilization of laparoscopes and arthroscopes will go unsettled until well -designed, randomized clinical trials are published, this guideline should be followed 1, 17. That is, laparoscopes, arthroscopes, and other scopes that enter normally steri le tissue should be sterilized before each use; if this is not feasible, they should receive at least high -level disinfection. Tonometers, Cervical Diaphragm Fitting Rings, Cryosurgical Instruments, and Endocavitary Probes Disinfection strategies vary widely for other semicritical items (e.g., applanation tonometers, rectal/vaginal probes, cryosurgical instruments, and diaphragm fitting rings). FDA requests that device manufacturers include at least one validated cleaning and disinfection/sterilization protocol in the labeling for their devices. As with all medications and devices, users should be familiar with the label instructions. One study revealed that no uniform technique was in use for disinfection of applanation tonometers, with disinfectant contact times varying from <15 sec to 20 minutes 28. In view of the potential for transmission of viruses (e.g., herpes simplex virus [HSV], adenovirus 8, or HIV) 184 by tonometer tips, CDC recommended that the tonometer tips be wiped clean and disinfected for 5- 10 minutes with either 3% hydrogen peroxide, 5000 ppm chlorine, 70% ethyl al cohol, or 70% isopropyl alcohol 95. However, more recent data suggest that 3% hydrogen peroxide and 70% isopropyl alcohol are not effective against adenovirus capable of causing epidemic keratoconjunctivitis and similar viruses and should not be used for disinfecting applanation tonometers 49, 185, 186. Structural damage to Schiotz tonometers has been observed with a 1:10 sodium hypochl orite (5, 000 ppm chlorine) and 3% hydrogen peroxide187. After disinfection, the tonometer should be thoroughly rinsed in tapwater and air dried before use. Although these disinfectants and exposure times should kill pathogens that can infect the eyes, no studies directly support this 188, 189. The guidelines of the American Academy of Ophthalmology for preventing infections in ophthalmology focus on only one potential pathogen: HIV. 190 Because a short and simple decontamination procedure is desirable in the clinical setting, swabbing the tonometer tip with a 70% isopropyl alcohol wipe sometimes is practiced. 189 Preliminary reports suggest that wiping the tonometer tip with an alcohol swab and then allowing the alcohol to evaporate might be effective in eliminating HSV, HIV, and adenovirus189, 191, 192. However, because these studies involved only a few replicates and were conducted in a controlled laboratory set ting, further studies are needed before this technique can be recommended. In addition, two reports have found that disinfection of pneumotonometer tips between uses with a 70% isopropyl alcohol wipe contributed to outbreaks of epidemic keratoconjunctivi tis caused Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 20 of 163 by adenovirus type 8193, 194. Limited studies have evaluated disinfection techniques for other items that contact mucous membranes, such as diaphragm fitting rings, cryosurgical probes 195, flexible 196 or vaginal/rectal probes used in sonographic scanning. Lettau, Bond, and McDougal of CDC supported the recommendation of a diaphragm fitting ring manufacturer that involved using a soap- and-water wash followed by a 15- minute immer sion in 70% alcohol96. This disinfection method should be adequate to inactivate HIV, HBV, and HSV even though alcohols are not classified as high -level disinfecta nts because their activity against picornaviruses is somewhat limited72. No data are available regardi ng inactivation of human papillomavirus (HPV) by alcohol or other disinfectants because in vitro replication of complete virions has not been achieved. Thus, even though alcohol for 15 minutes should kill pathogens of relevance in gynecology, no clinical s tudies directly support this practice. Vaginal probes are used in sonographic scanning. A vaginal probe and all endocavitary probes without a probe cover are semicritical devices because they have direct contact with mucous membranes (e.g., vagina, rectum, pharynx). While use of the probe cover could be considered as changing the category, this guideline proposes use of a new condom/probe cover for the probe for each patient, and because condoms/probe covers can fail 195, 197 -199, the probe also should be high- level disinfected. The relevance of this recommendation is reinforced with the findings that sterile transvaginal ultrasound probe covers have a very high rate of perforations even before use (0%, 25%, and 65% perforations from three suppliers). 199 One study found, after oocyte retrieval use, a very high rate of perforations in used endovaginal probe covers from two suppliers (75% and 81%) 199, other studies demonstrated a lower rate of perforations after use of condoms (2.0% and 0.9%) 197 200. Condoms have been found superior to commercially available probe covers for covering the ultrasound probe (1.7% for condoms versus 8.3% leakage for probe covers)201. These studies underscore the need for routine probe disinfection between examinations. Although most ultrasound manufacturers recommend use of 2% glutaraldehyde for high- level disinfection of contaminated transvaginal transducers, the this agent has been questioned 202 because it might s horten the life of the transducer and might have toxic effects on the gametes and embryos 203. An alter native procedure for disinfecting the vaginal transducer involves the mechanical removal of the gel from the transducer, cleaning the transducer in soap and water, wiping the transducer with 70% alcohol or soaking it for 2 minutes in 500 ppm chlorine, and rinsing with tap water and air drying204. The effectiveness of this and other methods 200 has not been validated in either rigorous laboratory experiments or in clinical use. High-level di sinfection with a product (e.g., hydrogen peroxide) that is not toxic to staff, patients, probes, and retrieved cells should be used until the effectiveness of alternative procedures against microbes of importance at the cavitary site is demonstrated by we ll- designed experimental scientific studies. Other probes such as rectal, cryosurgical, and transesophageal probes or devices also should be high- level disinfected between patients. Ultrasound probes used during surgical procedures also can contact steri le body sites. These probes can be covered with a sterile sheath to reduce the level of contamination on the probe and reduce the risk for infection. However, because the sheath does not completely protect the probe, the probes should be sterilized between each patient use as with other critical items. If this is not possible, at a minimum the probe should be high- level disinfected and covered with a sterile probe cover. Some cryosurgical probes are not fully immersible. During reprocessing, the tip of the probe should be immersed in a high- level disinfectant for the appropriate time; any other portion of the probe that could have mucous membrane contact can be disinfected by immersion or by wrapping with a cloth soaked in a high-level disinfectant to allo w the recommended contact time. After disinfection, the probe should be rinsed with tap water and dried before use. Health- care facilities that use nonimmersible probes should replace them as soon as possible with fully immersible probes. As with other h igh-level disinfection procedures, proper cleaning of probes is necessary to ensure the success of the subsequent disinfection 205. One study demonstrated that vegetative bacteria Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 21 of 163 inoculated on vaginal ultrasound probes decreased when the probes were cleaned with a towel 206. No information is available about either the level of contamination of such probes by potential viral pathogens such as HBV and HPV or their removal by cleaning (such as with a towel). Because these pathogens might be present in vaginal and rectal secretions and contaminate probes during use, high- level disinfection of the probes after such use is recommended. Dental Instruments Scientific articles and increased publicity about the potential for transmitting infectious agents in dentistry have focused attention on dental instruments as possible a gents for pathogen transmission207, 208. The American Dental Association recommends that surgical and other instruments that normally penetrate soft tissue or bone (e.g., extraction forceps, scalpel blades, bone chisels, periodontal scalers, and surgical burs) be classified as critical devices t hat should be sterilized after each use or discarded. Instruments not intended to penetrate oral soft tissues or bone (e.g., amalgam condensers, and air/water syringes) but that could contact oral tissues are classified as semicritical, but sterilization after each use is recommended if the instruments are heat -tolerant 43, 209. If a semicritical item is heat -sensitive, it should, at a minimum, be processed with high- level disinfection 43, 210. Handpieces can be contaminated internally with patient material and should be heat sterilized after each patient. Handpieces that cannot be heat sterilized should not be used. 211 Methods of sterilization that can be used for critical or semicritical dental instruments and materials that are heat -stable include steam under pressure (aut oclave), chemical (formaldehyde) vapor, and dry heat (e.g., 320\u00baF for 2 hours). Dental professionals most commonly use the steam sterilizer 212. All three sterilization procedures can damage some dental instruments, including steam -sterilized hand pieces 213. Heat-tolerant alternatives are available f or most clinical dental applications and are preferred43. CDC has divided noncritical surfaces in dental offices into clinical contact and housekeeping surfaces43. Clinical contact surfaces are surfaces that might be touched frequently with gloved hands during patient care or that might become contaminated with blood or other potentially infectious material and subsequently contact instruments, hands, gloves, or devices (e.g., light handles, switches, dental X - ray equipment, chair -side computers). Barrier protective coverings (e.g., clear plastic wraps) can be used for these surfaces, particularly those that are difficult to clean (e.g., light handles, chair switches). The coverings should be changed when visibly soiled or damaged and routinely (e.g., between patients). Protected surfaces should be disinfected at the end of each day or if contamination is evident. If not barrier -protected, these surfaces should be disinf ected between patients with an intermediate- disinfectant (i.e., EPA -registered hospital disinfectant with tuberculocidal claim) or low -level disinfectant (i.e., EPA - registered hospital disinfectant with an HBV and HIV label claim) 43, 214, 215. Most housekeeping surfaces need to be cleaned only with a detergent and water or an EPA - registered hospital disinfectant, depending of the nature of the surface and the type and degree of contamination. When housekeeping surfaces are visibly contaminated by blood or body substances, however, prompt removal and surface disinfection is a sound infection control practice and required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 43, 214. Several studies have demonstrated variability among dental practices while trying to meet these recommendations216, 217. For example, 68% of respondents believed they were sterilizing their instruments but did not use appropriate chemical sterilants or exposure times and 49% of respondents did not challenge autoclaves with biological indicators216. Other investigators using biologic indicators have found a high proportion (15% -65%) of positive spore tests after assessing the efficacy of sterilizers used in dental offices. In one study of Minnesota den tal offices, operator error, rat her than mechanical malfunction218, caused 87% of sterilization failures. Common factors in the improper use of steri lizers include chamber overload, low temperature setting, inadequate exposure t ime, failure to preheat the sterilizer , and interruption of the cycle. Mail-return sterilization monitoring services use spore strips to test sterilizers in dental cl inics, but Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 22 of 163 delay caused by mailing to the test laboratory could potentially cause false- negatives results. Studies revealed, however, that the post -sterilization time and temperature after a 7- day delay had no influence on the test results219. Delays (7 days at 27\u00baC and 37\u00baC, 3- day mail delay) did not cause any predictable pattern of inaccurate spore tests 220. Disinfection of HBV -, HCV -, HIV - or TB-Contaminated Devices The CDC recommendation for high- level disinfection of HBV -, HCV -, HIV - or TB -contaminated devices is appropriate because experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of high- level disinfectants to inactivate these and other pathogens that might contaminate semicritical devices 61, 62, 73, 81, 105, 121, 125, 221-238. Nonetheless, some healthcare facilities have modified their disinfection procedures when endoscopes are used with a patient known or suspected to be infected with HBV, HIV, or M. tuberculosis 28, 239. This is inconsistent with the concept of Standard Precautions that presumes all patients are potentially inf ected with bloodborne pathogens228. Several studies have highli ghted the inability to distinguish HBV - or HIV -infected patients from noninfected patients on clinical grounds240-242. In addition, mycobacterial infection is unlikely to be clinically apparent in many patients. In most instances, hospitals that altered their disinfection procedure used EtO sterilization on the endoscopic instruments because they believed this practice reduced the risk for infection 28, 239. EtO is not routinely used for endoscope sterilization because of the lengthy processing time. Endoscopes and other semicritical devices should be managed the same way regardless of whether the patient is known to be infected with HBV, HCV, HIV or M. tuberculosis . An evaluation of a manual disinfection procedure to eliminate HCV from experimentally contami nated endoscopes provided some evidence that cleaning and 2% glutaraldehyde for 20 minutes should prevent transmis sion 236. A study that used experimentally contaminated hysteroscopes detected HCV by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in one (3%) of 34 samples after cleaning with a detergent, but no samples were positive after treatment with a 2% glutaraldehyde solution for 20 minutes 120. Another study demonstrated complete elimination of HCV (as detected by PCR) from endoscopes used on chronically infected patients after clean ing and disinfection for 3- 5 minutes in glutaraldehyde 118. Similarly, PCR was used to demonstrate complete elimination of HCV after standard disinfection of experimentally contaminated endoscopes 236 and endoscopes used on HCV -antibody - positive patients had no detectable HCV RNA after high- level disinfection 243. The inhibitory activity of a phenolic and a chlorine compound on HCV showed that the phenolic inhibited the binding and replication of HCV, but the chlorine was ineffective, probably because of its low concentration and its neutralization in the presence of organic matter 244. Disinfection in the Hemodialysis Unit Hemodialysis systems incl ude hemodialysis machines, water supply, water -treatment systems, and distribution systems. During hemodialysis, patients have acquired bloodborne viruses and pathogenic bacteria 245-247. Cleaning and disinfection are important components of infection control in a hemodialysis center. EPA and FDA regulate disinfectants used to reprocess hemodialyzers, hemodialysis machines, and water -treatment systems. Noncritical surfaces (e.g., dialysis bed or chair, countertops, external surfaces of dialysis machines, and equipment [scissors, hemostats, clamps, blood pressure cuffs, stethoscopes]) should be disinfected with an EPA -registered disinfectant unless the item is visibly contaminated with blood; in that case a tuberculocidal agent (or a disinfectant with specific label claims for HBV and HIV) or a 1:100 dilution of a hypoch lorite solution (500 -600 ppm free chlorine) should be used 246, 248. This procedure accomplishes two goals : it removes soil on a regular basis and maintains an environment that is consistent with good patient care. Hemodialyzers are disinfected with peracetic acid, formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, heat pasteurization with citric acid, and chlorine- containing compounds 249. Hemodialysis systems usually are disinfected by chlorine- based disinfectants (e.g., sodium hypochlorite), aqueous Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 23 of 163 formaldehyde, heat pasteurization, ozone, or peracetic acid 250, 251. All products must be used according to the manufacturers' recommendations. Some dialysis systems use hot -water disinfection to control microbial contamination. At its high point, 82% of U.S. chronic hemodialysis centers were reprocessing (i.e., reusing) dialyzers for the same patient using high- level disinfection 249. However, one of the large dialysis organizations has decided to phase out reuse and, by 2002 the percentage of dialysis facilities reprocessing hemodialyzers had decreased to 63% 252. The two commonly used disinfectants to reprocess dialyzers were peracetic acid and formaldehyde; 72% used peracetic 20% used formaldehyde to disinfect hemodialyzers. Another 4% of the facilities used either glutaraldehyde or heat pasteurization in combination with citric acid 252. Infection- control recommendations, including disinfection and sterilization and the use of dedicated machines for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) - positive patients, in the hemodialysis setting were detailed in two reviews 245, 246. The Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation(AAMI) has published recommendations for the reuse of hemodialyzers253. Inactivation of Clostridium difficile The source of health- care- associated acquisition of Clostridium difficile in nonepidemic settings has not been determined. The environment and carriage on the hands of health- care personnel have been considered possible sources of infection 66, 254. Carpeted rooms occupied by a patient with C. difficile were more heavily contaminated with C. difficile than were noncarpeted rooms 255. Because C. difficile spore- production can increase when exposed to nonchlorine- based cleaning agents and the spores are more resistant than vegetative cells to commonly used surface disinfectants256, some investigators have recommended use of dilute solutions of hypochlorite (1,600 ppm available chlorine) for routine environmental disinfection of rooms of patients with C. difficile -associated diarrhea or colitis 257, to reduce the incidence of C. difficile diarrhea 258, or in units with high C. difficile rates. 259 Stool samples of patients with symptomatic C. difficile colitis contain spores of the organism, as demonstrated by ethanol treatment of the stool to reduce the overgrowth of fecal flora when isolating C. difficile in the laboratory260, 261. C. difficile -associated diarrhea rates were shown to have decreased markedly in a bone- marrow transplant unit (from 8.6 to 3.3 cases per 1,000 patient -days) during a period of bleach disinfection (1:10 dilution) of environmental surfaces compared with cleaning with a quaternary ammonium compound. C. difficile Update [M ay 2019] EPA- registered products specific for inactivating C. difficile spores, should be used in units with high C. difficile rates. Thus, combined use of appropriate hand hygiene, barrier precautions, and meticulous environmental cleaning, and use of an EPA -regis tered disinfectant that is appropriate for the level of risk, should effectively prevent spread of the organism. [ LIST K: EPA's Registered Antimicrobial Products Effective against Clostridium difficile Spores ] Acidified bleach and regular bleach (5000 ppm chlorine) can inactivate 106 C. difficile spores in 10 minutes 262. However, studies have shown that asymptomatic patients consti tute an important reservoir within the health- care facility and that person- to-person transmission is the principal means of transmission between patients. Thus, combined use of hand washing, barrier precautions, and meticulous environmental cleaning with an EPA -registered disinfectant (e.g., germicidal detergent) should effectively prevent spread of the organism 263. Contaminated medical devices, such as colonoscopes and thermometers,can be vehicles for transmission of C. difficile spores 264. For this reason, investigators have studied commonly used disinfectants and exposure times to assess whether current practices can place patients at risk. Data demonstrate that 2% glutaraldehyde 79, 265 -267 and peracetic acid 267, 268 reliably kill C. difficile spores using exposure times of 5- 20 minutes. ortho- Phthalaldehyde and 0.2% peracetic acid (WA Rutala, personal communication, April 2006) also can inactivate 104 C. difficile spores in 10- 12 minutes at 20\u00baC 268. Sodium dichlorois ocyanurate at a concentration of 1000 ppm available chlorine achieved lower log 10 reduction factors against C. difficile spores at 10 min, ranging from 0.7 to 1.5, than 0.26% peracetic acid Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 24 of 163 with log 10 reduction factors ranging from 2.7 to 6.0268. OSHA Bloodborne Pathogen Standard In December 1991, OSHA promulgated a standard entitled \"Occupational Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens\" to eliminate or minimize occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens 214. One component of this requirement is that all equipment and environmental and working surfaces be cleaned and decontaminated with an appropriate disinfectant after contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials. Even though the OSHA standard does not specify the type of disinfectant or procedure, the OSHA original compliance document 269 suggested that a germicide must be tuberculocidal to kill the HBV. To follow the OSHA compliance document a tuberculocidal disinfectant (e.g., phenolic, and chlorine) would be needed to clean a blood spill. However, in February 1997, OSHA amended its policy and stated that EPA -registered disinfectants labeled as effective against HIV and HBV would be considered as appropriate disinfectants \". . . provided such surfaces have not become contaminated with agent(s) or volumes of or concentrations of agent(s) for which higher level disinfection is recommended.\" When bloodborne pathogens other than HBV or HIV are of concern, OSHA continues to require use of EPA -registered tuberculocidal disinfectants or hypochlorite solution (diluted 1:10 or 1:100 with water) 215, 228. Studies demonstrate that, in the presence of large blood spills, a 1:10 final dilution of EPA -registered hypochlorite solution initially should be used to inactivate bloodborne viruses 63, 235 to minimize risk f or infection to health- care personnel from percutaneous injury during Respiratory Syndrome [SARS] Coronavirus) Emerging pathogens are of growing concern to the general public and infection- control professionals. Relevant pathogens include tuberculosis , and nontuberculous mycobacteria (e.g., M. chelonae). The susceptibility of each of these pathogens to chemical disinfectants and sterilants has been studied. With the exceptions discus sed below, all of these emerging pathogens are susceptible to currently available chemical disinfectants and sterilants 270. Cryptosporidium is resistant to chlorine at concentrations used in potable water. C. parvum is not completely inactivated by most disinfectants used in healthcare including ethyl alcohol 271, glutaraldeh yde 271, 272, 5.25% hypochlorite 271, acid 271, ortho- phthalaldehyde 271, phenol 272, povidone- iodine 271, 272, and quaternary ammonium compounds271. The only chemical disinfectants and sterilants able to inactivate greater than 3 log 10 of C. parvum were 6% and 7.5% hydrogen peroxide 271. Sterilization methods will fully inactivate C. parvum, including steam 271, EtO 271, 273, and hydrogen peroxide gas plasma271. Although most disinfectants are ineffective against C. parvum, current cleaning and disinfection practices appear satisfactory to prevent healthcare- associated transmission. For example, endoscopes are unlikely to be an important vehicle for transmitting C. parvum because the results of bacterial studies indicate mechanical cleaning will remove approximately 104 organisms, and drying results in rapid loss of C. parvum viability (e.g., 30 minutes, 2.9 log 10 decrease; and 60 minutes, 3.8 log 10 decrease) 271. Chlorine at ~1 ppm has been found capable of eliminating approximately 4 log 10 of E. coli O157:H7 within 1 minute in a suspension test64. Electrolyzed oxidizing water at 23 \u00b0C was effective in 10 minutes in producing a 5- log10 decrease in E. coli O157:H7 inoculate d onto kitchen cutting boards274. The following disinfectants eliminated >5 log 10 of E. coli O157:H7 within 30 seconds: a quaternary ammonium compound, a hypochlorite (1:10 dilution of 5.25% bleach), and ethanol53. Disinfectants including chlorine compounds can reduce E. coli O157:H7 experimentally inocula ted onto alfalfa seeds or sprouts 275, 276 or beef carcass surfaces277. Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 25 of 163 Data are limited on the susceptibility of H. pylori to disinfectants. Using a suspension test, one study assessed the effectiveness of a variety of disinfectants against nine strains of H. pylori 60. Ethanol (80%) and glutaraldehyde (0.5%) hypochlorite (150 ppm) killed all strains within 30 seconds. Both ethanol (80%) and glutaraldehyde (0.5%) retained similar bactericidal activ ity in the presence of organic matter ; the other disinfectants showed reduced bactericidal activity. In particular, the bactericidal activity of povidone- iodine (0.1%) and sodium hypochlorite (150 ppm) markedly decreased in the presence of dried yeast solution with killing times increased to 5 - 10 minutes and 5 - 30 minutes, respectively. Immers ing biopsy forceps in formalin before obtaining a specimen does not affect the ability to culture H. pylori from the biopsy specimen 278. The following methods are ineffective for eliminating H. pylori from endoscopes: cl eaning with soap and water 119, 279, immersion ethanol for 3 minutes280, instillation of 0.2% Hyamine solution281. The differing results with regard to the efficacy of ethyl alcohol against Helicobacter are unexplained. Cleaning followed by use of 2% alkaline glutaraldehyde (or automated peracetic acid) has been demonstrated by culture to be effective in eliminating H. pylori 119, 279, 282. Epidemiologic investigations of patients who had undergone endoscopy with endoscopes mechanically washed and disinfected with 2.0% -2.3% glutaraldehyde have revealed no evidence of person- to- person transmission of H. pylori 126, 283. Disinfection experimentally contaminated endoscopes using 2% ( 10-minute, times ) or the peracetic acid system (with and without active peracetic acid) has been demonstrated to be effective in eliminating H. pylori 119. H. pylori DNA has been detected by PCR in fluid flushed from endoscope channels after cleaning and disinfection with 2% glutaraldehyde 284. The clinical signif icance of this finding is unclear. In vitro experiments have demonstrated a >3.5- log10 reduction in H. pylori after exposure to 0.5 mg/L of free chlorine for 80 seconds285. An outbreak of healthcare- associated rotavirus gastroenteritis on a pediatric unit has been reported 286. Person to person through the hands of health- care workers was proposed as the mechanism of transmission. Prolonged survival of rotavirus on environmental surfaces (90 minutes to >10 days at room temperature) and hands (>4 hours) has been demonstrated. Rotavirus suspended in feces can survi ve longer 287, 288. Vectors have included hands, fomites, air, water, an d food 288, 289. Products with demonstrated efficacy (>3 log 10 reduction in virus) against rotavirus within 1 ammonium compounds 59, 290- 293. In a human challenge study, a disinfectant spray (0.1% ortho- phenylphenol and 79% ethanol), sodium hypochlorite (800 and a phenol -based product (14.7% phenol diluted 1:256 in tapwater) when sprayed onto contaminated stainless steel disks , were effective in interrupting transfer of a human rotavirus from stainless steel disk to fingerpads of volunteers after an exposure time of 3- 10 minutes. A quaternary ammonium product (7.05% quaternary ammonium compound diluted 1:128 in tapwater) and tapwater allowed transfer of virus 52. No data exist on the inactivation of HPV by alcohol or other disinfectants because in vitro replication of complete virions has not been achieved. Similarly, little is known about inactivation of noroviruses (members of the family Caliciviridae and important causes of gastroenteritis in humans) because they cannot be grown in tissue culture. Improper disinfection of environmental surfaces contaminated by feces or vomitus of infected patients is believed to play a role in the spread of noroviruses in some settings 294-296. Prolonged survival of a norovirus surrogate (i.e., feline calicivirus virus [FCV], a closely related cultivable virus) has been demonstrated (e.g., at room temperature, FCV in a dried state survived for 21- 18 days) 297. Inactivation studies with FCV have shown the effectiveness of chlorine, glutaraldehyde, and iodine- based products whereas the quaternary ammonium compound, detergent, and ethanol failed to inactivate the virus completely. 297 An evaluation of the effectiveness of several disinfectants against the feline calicivirus found that bleach diluted to 1000 ppm of available chlorine reduced infectivity of FCV by 4.5 logs in 1 minute. Other effective (log 10 reduction factor of >4 in virus) disinfectants included accelerated hydrogen peroxide, 5,000 ppm (3 min); chlorine dioxide, 1,000 ppm Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 26 of 163 chlorine (1 min); a mixture of four quaternary ammonium compounds, 2,470 ppm (10 min); 79% quaternary ammonium compound (3 min); and 75% ethanol (10 min) 298. A quaternary ammonium compound exhibited activity against feline calicivirus supensions dried on hard surface carriers in 10 minutes 299. Seventy percent ethanol and 70% 1- propanol reduced FCV by a 3- 4-log10 reduction in 30 seconds 300. CDC announced that a previously unrecognized human virus from the coronavirus family is the leading hypothesis for the cause of a described syndrome of SARS 301. Two coronaviruses that are known to infect humans cause one third of common colds and can cause gastroenteritis. The virucidal efficacy of chemical germicides against coronavirus has been investigated. A study of disinfectants against coronavirus 229E found several that were effective after a 1- minute contact time; these included sodium hypochlorite (at a free chlorine concentration of 1,000 ppm and 5,000 ppm), 70% ethyl alcohol, and povidone- iodine (1% iodine) 70% ethanol, >3 logs of two animal coronaviruses (mouse hepatitis virus, canine coronavirus) after a 10- minute exposure time 302. The activity of povidone- iodine has been demonstrated against human coronaviruses 229E and OC43 303. A study also show ed complete inactivation of the SARS coronavirus by 70% ethanol and povidone- iodine with an exposur e times of 1 minute and 2.5% glutaraldehyde with an exposure time of 5 minute 304. Because the SARS coronavirus is stable in feces and urine at room temperature for at least 1 -2 days [The current version of this document may differ from original: First data on stability and resistance of SARS coronavirus compiled by members of WHO laboratory network (http://www.who.int/csr/sars/survival_2003_05_04/en/) ], surfaces might be a possible source of contamination and lead to infection with the SARS coronavirus and should be disinfected. Until more precise information is available, environments in which SARS patients are housed should be considered heavily contaminated, and rooms and equipment should be thoroughly disinfected daily and after the patient is discharged. EPA -registered disinfectants or 1:100 dilution of household bleach and water should be used for surface disinfection and disinfection on noncritical patient -care equipment. High- level disinfection and sterilization of semicritical and critical medical devices, respectively, does not need to be altered for patients with known or suspected SARS. Free-living amoeba can be pathogenic and can harbor agents of pneumonia such as Legionella pneu mophila. Limited studies have shown that 2% peracetic acid do not completely inactivate Acanthamoeba polyphaga in a 20-minute exposure time for high- level disinfection. If amoeba are found to contaminate instruments and facilitate infect ion, longer immersion times or other disinfectan ts may need to be considered 305. Inactivation of Bioterrorist Agents Publications have highlighted concerns about the potential for biological terrorism306, 307. CDC has categorized several agents as \"high priority\" because they can be easily disseminated or transmitted from person to person, cause high mortality, and are likely to cause public panic and social disruption 308. These agents include Bacillus anthracis (the cause of anthrax), Yersinia pestis (plague), variola major (smallpox), Clostridium botulinum A few comments can be made regarding the role of sterilization and disinfection of potential agents of bioterrorism309. First, the susceptibility of these agents to germicides in vitro is similar to that of other related pathogens. For example, variola is similar to vaccinia 72, 310, 311 and B. anthracis is similar to B. atrophaeus (formerly B. subtilis)312, 313. B. subtilis spores, for instance, proved as resistant as, if not more resistant than, B. anthracis spores (>6 log 10 reduction of B. anthracis spores in 5 minutes with acidified bleach [5,250 ppm chlorine])313. Thus, one can extrapolate from the larger database available on the susceptibility of genetically similar organisms314. Second, many of the potential bioterrorist agents are Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 27 of 163 stable enough in the environment that contaminated environmental surfaces or fomites could lead to transmission of agents such as B. anthracis , F. tularensis , variola major, C. botulinum toxin, and C. burnetti 315. Third, data suggest that current disinfection and sterilization practices are appropriate for managing patient -care equipment and environmental surfaces when potentially contaminated patients are evaluated and/or admitted in a health- care facility after exposure to a bioterrorist agent. For example, sodium hypochlorite can be used for surface disinfection (see [This li nk is no longer active: http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/factsheets/chemicals/bleachfactsheet.htm.]). In instances where the health- care facility is the site of a bioterrorist attack, environmental decontamination might require special decontamination procedures (e.g., chlorine dioxide gas for B. anthracis spores). Because no antimicrobial products are registered for decontamination of biologic agents after a bioterrorist attack, EPA has granted a crises exemption for each product (see [This link is no longer active: http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/factsheets/chemicals/bleachfactsheet.htm.]). Of only theoretical concern is the possibility that a bioterrorist agent could be engineered to be less susceptible to disinfection and sterilization processes 309. Toxicological, Environmental and Occupational Concerns Health hazards associated with the use of germicides in healthcare vary from mucous membrane irritation to death, with the latter involving accidental injection by mentally disturbed patients316. Although their degrees of toxicity vary 317-320, all disinfectants should be used with the proper safety precautions 321 and only for the intended purpose. Key factors associated with assessing the health risk of a chemical exposure include the duration, intensity (i.e., how much chemical is involved), and route (e.g., skin, mucous membranes, and inhalation) of exposure. Toxicity can be acute or chronic. Acute toxicity usually results from an accidental spill of a chemical substanc e. Exposure is sudden and often produces an emergency situation. Chronic toxicity results from repeated exposure to low levels of the chemical over a prolonged period. Employers are responsible for informing workers about the chemical hazards in the workpl ace and implementing control measures. The OSHA Hazard Communication Standard (29 CFR 1910.1200, 1915.99, 1917.28, 1918.90, 1926.59, and 1928.21) requires manufacturers and importers of hazardous chemicals to develop Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for each chemical or mixture of chemicals. Employers must have these data sheets readily available to employees who work with the products to which they could be exposed. Exposure limits have been published for many chemicals used in health care to help provide a safe environment and, as relevant, are discussed in each section of this guideline. Only the exposure limits published by OSHA carry the legal force of regulations . OSHA publishes a limit as a time -weighted average (TWA), that is, the average concentration for a normal 8- hour work day and a 40- hour work week to which nearly all workers can be repeatedly exposed to a chemical without adverse health effects. For example, the permissible exposure limit (PEL) for EtO is 1.0 ppm, 8 hour TWA. The CDC National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) develops recommended exposure limits (RELs). RELs are occupational exposure limits recommended by NIOSH as being protective of worker health and safety over a working lifetime. This limit is frequently expressed as a 40 -hour TWA exposure for up to 10 hours per day during a 40- hour work week. These exposure limits are designed for inhalation exposures. Irritant and al lergic effects can occur below the exposure limits, and skin contact can result in dermal effects or systemic absorption without inhalation. The American Conference on Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIN) also provides guidelines on exposure limits 322. Information about workplace exposures and methods to reduce them (e.g., work practices, engineering controls, PPE) is available on the OSHA (https://www.osha.gov/) and NIOSH (https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ ) websites. Some states have excluded or limited concentrations of certain chemical germicides (e.g., glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, and some phenols) from disposal through the sewer system. These Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 28 of 163 rules are intended to minimize environmental harm. If health- care facili ties exceed the maximum allowable concentration of a chemical (e.g., 5.0 mg/L), they have three options. First, they can switch to alternative products; for example, they can change from glutaraldehyde to another disinfectant for high-level disinfection o r from phenolics to quaternary ammonium compounds for low -level disinfection. Second, the health- care facility can collect the disinfectant and dispose of it as a hazardous chemical. Third, the facility can use a commercially available small -scale treatment method (e.g., neutralize glutaraldehyde with glycine). Safe disposal of regulated chemicals is important throughout the medical community. For disposal of large volumes of spent solutions, users might decide to neutralize the microbicidal activity before disposal (e.g., glutaraldehyde). Solutions can be neutralized by reaction with chemicals such as sodium bisulfite 323, 324 or glycine 325. European authors have suggested that instruments and ventilation therapy equipment should be disinfected by heat rather than by chemicals. The concerns for chemical disinfection include toxic side effects for the patient caused by chemical residues on the instrument or object, occupational exposure to toxic chemicals, and recontamination by rinsing the disinfectant with microbially contaminated tap water 326. Disinfection in Ambulatory Care, Home Care, and the Home With the advent of managed healthcare, increasing numbers of patients are now being cared for in ambulatory -care and home settings. Many patients in these settings might have communicable diseases, immunocompromising conditions, or invasive devices. Therefore, adequate disinfection in these settings is necessary to provide a safe patient environment. Because the ambulatory -care setting (i.e., outpatient facility) provides the same risk for infection as the hospital, the Spauld ing classification scheme described in this guideline should be followed (Table 1) .17 The home environment should be much safer than hospitals or ambulatory care. Epidemics should not be a problem , and cross -infection should be rare. The healthcare provider is responsible for providing the responsible family member information about infection- control procedures to follow in the home, including hand hygiene, proper cleaning and disinfection of equipment, and safe storage of cleaned and disinfected devices. Among the products recommended for home disinfection of reusable objects are bleach, alcohol, and hydrogen peroxide. APIC recommends that reusable objects (e.g., tracheostomy tubes) that membranes be disinfected by immersion in 70% isopropyl alcohol for 5 minutes or in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 30 minutes. Additionally, a 1:50 dilution of 5.25% -6.15% sodium hypochlorite (household bleach) for 5 minutes should be effective 327-329. Noncritical items (e.g., blood pressure cuffs, crutches) can be cleaned with a detergent. Blood spills should be handled according to OSHA regulations as previously described (see section on OSHA Bloodborne Pathogen Standard). In general, sterilization of critical items is not practical in homes but theoretically could be accomplished by chemical sterilants or boiling. Single- use disposable items can be used or reusable items sterilized in a hospital 330, 331. Some environmental groups advocate \"environmentally safe\" products as alternatives to commercial germicides in the home- care setting. These alternatives (e.g., ammonia, baking soda, vinegar, Borax, liquid detergent) are not registered with EPA and should not be used for disinfecting because they are ineffective against S. aureus . Borax, baking soda, and detergents also are ineffective against Salmonella Typhi and E.coli ; however, undiluted vinegar and ammonia are effective against S. Typhi and E.coli 53, 332, 333. Common commercial disinfectants designed for home use also are effective against selected antibiotic -resistant bacteria 53. Public concerns have been raised that the use of antimicrobials in the home can promote development of antibiotic -resistant bacteria 334, 335. This issue is unresolved and needs to be considered Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 29 of 163 further through scientific and clinical investigations. The public health benefits of using disinfectants in the home are unknown. However, some facts are known: many sites in the home kitchen and bathroom are microbially contaminated 336, use of hypochlorites markedly reduces bacteria 337, and good standards of hygiene (e.g., food hygiene, hand hygiene) can help reduce infections in the home 338, 339. In addition, laboratory studies indicate that many commercially prepared household disinfectants are effective against common pathogens 53 and can interrupt surface- to-human trans mission of pathogens 48. The \"targeted hygiene concept\" \u2014which means identifying sit uations and areas (e.g., food- preparation surfaces and bathroom) where risk exists for transmission of pathogens \u2014may be a reasonable way to identify when disinfection might be appropriate 340. Susceptibility of Antibiotic -Resistant Bacteria to Disinfectants As with antibiotics, reduced susceptibility (or acquired \"resistance\") of bacteria to disinfectants can arise by either chromosomal gene mutation or acquisition of genetic material in the form of plasmids or transposons 338, 341 -343, 344 , 345, 346. When changes occur in bacterial susceptibility that renders an antibiotic ineffective against an infection previously treatable by that antibiotic, the bacteria are referred to as \"resistant.\" In contrast, reduced susceptibility to disinfectants does not correlate with failure of the disinfectant because concentrations used in disinfection still greatly exceed the cidal level. Thus, the word \"resistance\" when applied to these changes is incorrect, and the preferred term i s \"reduced susceptibility\" or \"increased tolerance\"344, 347. No data are available that show that antibiotic -resistant bacteria are less sensitive to the liquid chemical germicides than antibiotic -sensitive bacteria at currently used germicide contact conditions and concentrations . MRSA and vancomycin- resistant Enterococcus (VRE) are important health- care- associated agents. Some antiseptics and disinfectants have been known for years to be, because of MICs, somewhat less inhibitory to S. aureus strains that contain a plasmid- carrying gene encoding resistance to the antibiotic gentamicin 344. For example, gentamicin resistance has been shown to also encode reduced susceptibility to propamidine, quaternary ammonium compounds, and ethidium bromide 348, and MRSA strains have been found to be less susceptible than methicillin- sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) strains to chlorhexidine, propamidine, and the quaternary ammonium compound cetrimide 349. In other studies, MRSA and MSSA strains have been equally sensitive to phenols and chlorhexidine, but MRSA strains were slightly more tolerant to quaternary ammonium compounds 350. Two gene families ( qacCD [now referred to as smr ] and qac AB) are involved in providing protection against agents that are components of disinfectant formulations such as quaternary ammonium compounds. Staphylococci have been proposed to evade destruction because the protein specified by the qacA determinant is a cytoplasmic -membrane -associated protein involved in an efflux system that act ively reduces intracellular accumulation of toxicants, such as quaternary ammonium compounds, to intracellular targets . 351 Other studies demonstrated that plasmid- mediated formaldehyde tolerance is transferable from Serratia marcescens to E. coli 352 and plasmid- mediated quaternary ammonium tolerance is transferable from S. aureus to E. coli .353. Tolerance to mercury and silver also is plasmid borne. 341, 343- 346 Because the concentrations of disinfectants used in practice are much higher than the MICs observed, even for the more tolerant strains, the clinical relevance of these observations is questionable. Several studies have found antibiotic -resistant hospital strains of common healthcare- associated pathogens (i.e., Enterococcus, P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella , S. aureus, and S. epidermidis ) to be equally susceptible to disinfectants as antibiotic -sensitive strains 53, 354 -356. The susceptibility of glycopeptide- intermediate S. aureus was similar to vancomycin- susceptible, MRSA 357. On the basis of these data, routine disinfection and housekeeping protocols do not need to be altered because of antibiotic resistance pr ovided the disinfection method is effective 358, 359. A study that evaluated the efficacy of s elected cleaning methods (e.g., QUAT -sprayed cloth, and QUAT -immersed cloth) for eliminating VRE found that currently used disinfection processes most likely are highly effective in eliminating VRE. However, surface disinfection must involve contact with a ll contaminated Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 30 of 163 surfaces 358. A new method using an invisible flurorescent marker to objectively evaluate the thoroughness of cleaning activities in patient rooms might lead to improvement in cleaning of all objects and surfaces but needs further evaluation. 360 Lastly, does the use of antiseptics or disinfectants facilitate the development of disinfectant -tolerant organisms? Evidence and reviews indicate enhanced tolerance to disinfectants can be developed in response to disinfectant exposure 334, 335, 346, 347, 361. However, the level of tolerance is not important in clinical terms because it is low and unlikely to compromise the effectiveness of disinfectants of which much higher concentrations are used 347, 362. The issue of whether low -level tolerance to germicides selects for antibiotic -resistant strains is unsettled but might depend on the mechanism by which tolerance is attained. For example, changes in the permeability barrier or efflux mechanisms might affect susceptibility to both antibiotics and germicides, but specific changes to a target site might not. Some researchers have suggested that use of disinfectants or antiseptics (e.g., triclosan) could facilitate development of antibiotic -resistant microorganisms 334, 335, 363. Although evidence in laboratory studies indicates low -level resistance to triclosan, the concentrations of triclosan in these studies were low (generally <1 g/mL) and dissimilar from the higher levels used in antimicrobial products (2,000 -20,000 g/mL) 364, 365. Thus, researchers can create laboratory -derived mutants that demonstrate reduced susceptibility to antiseptics or disinfectants. In some experiments, such bacteria have demonstrated reduced susceptibility to certain antibiotics 335. There is no evidence that using antiseptics or disinfectants selects for antibiotic -resistant organisms in nature or that such mutants survive in nature366. ). In addition, the action of antibiotics and the action of disinfectants differ fundamentally. Antibiotics are selectively toxic and generally have a single target site in bacteria, thereby inhibiting a specific biosynthetic process. Germicides generally are considered nonspecific antimicrobials because of a multiplicity of toxic -effect mechanisms or target sites and are broader spectrum in the types of microorganisms against which they are effective 344, 347. The rotational use of disinfectants in some environments (e.g., pharmacy production units) has been recommended and practiced in an attempt to prevent development of resistant microbes 367, 368. There have been only rare c ase reports that appropriately used disinfectants have resulted in a clinical problem arising from the selection or development of nonsus ceptible microorganisms 369. Surface Disinfection The effective use of disinfectants is part of a multibarrier strategy to prevent health- care- associated infections. Surfaces are considered noncritical items because they contact intact skin. Use of noncritical items or contact with noncritical surfaces carries little risk of causing an infection in patients or staff. Thus, the routine use of germicidal chemicals to disinfect hospital floors and other noncritical items is controversial 370-375. A 1991 study expanded the Spaulding scheme by dividing the noncritical environmental surfaces into housekeeping surfaces and medical equipment surfaces 376. The classes of disinfectants used on housek eeping and medical equipment surfaces can be similar. However, the frequency of decontaminating can vary (see Recommendations). Medical equipment surfaces (e.g., blood pressure cuffs, stethoscopes, hemodialysis machines, and X -ray machines) can become cont aminated with infectious agents and contribute to the spread of health- care- associated infections 248, 375. For this reason, noncritical medical equipment surfaces should be disinfected with an EPA -registered low - or intermediate- level disinfectant. Use of a disinfectant will provide antimicrobial activity that is likely to be achieved with minimal additional cost or work. Environmental surfaces (e.g., bedside table) also could potentially contribute to cross -transmission by contamination of health- care personnel from hand contact with contaminated surfaces, medi cal equipment, or patients 50, 375, 377. A paper reviews the epidemiologic and microbiologic data ( Table 3) regarding the use of disinfectants on noncritical surfaces 378. Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 31 of 163 Of the seven reasons to usie a disinfectant on noncritical surfaces, five are particularly noteworthy and support the use of a germicidal detergent. First, hospital floors become contaminated with microorganisms from settling airborne bacteria: by contact with shoes, wheels, and other objects; and occasionally by spills. The removal of microbes is a component in controling health- care- associated infections. In an investigation of the cleaning of hospital floors, the use of soap and water (80% reduction) was less effective in reducing the numbers of bacteria than was a phenolic disinfectant (94% - 99.9% reduction) 379. However, a few hours after floor disinfection, the bacterial count was nearly back to the pretreatment level. Second, detergents become contaminated and result in seeding the patient's environment with bacteria. Investigators have shown that mop water becomes increasingly dirty during cleaning and becomes contaminated if soap and water is used rather than a disinfectant. For example, in one study, bacterial contamination in soap and water without a disinfectant increased from 10 CFU/mL to 34,000 CFU/mL after cleaning a ward, whereas contamination in a disinfectant solution did not change (20 CFU/mL) 380. Contamination of surfaces close to the patient that are frequently touched by the patient or staff (e.g., bed rails) could result in patient exposures0 381. In a study, using of detergents on floors and patient room furniture, increased bacterial contamination of the patients' environmental surfaces was found after cleaning (average increase = 103.6 CFU/24cm2) 382. In addition, a P. aeruginosa outbreak was reported in a hematology -oncology unit associated with contamination of the surface cleaning equipment when nongermicidal cleaning solutions instead of disinfectants were used to decontaminate the patients' environment 383 and another study demonstrated the role of environmental cleaning in controlling an outbreak of Acinetobacter baumannii 384. Studies also have shown that, in situations where the cleaning procedure failed to eliminate contamination from the surface and the cloth is used to wipe another surface, the contamination is transferred to that surf ace and the hands of the person holding the cloth381, 385. Third, the CDC Isolation Guideline recommends that noncritical equipment contaminated with blood, body fluids, secretions, or excretions be cleaned and disinfected after use. The same guideline recommends that, in addition to cleaning, disinfection of the bedside equipment and environmental surfaces (e.g., bedrails, bedside tables, carts, commodes, door -knobs, and faucet handles) is indicated for certain pathogens, e.g., enterococci, which can survive in the inanimate en vironment for prolonged periods 386. Fourth, OSHA requires that surfaces contaminated with blood and other potentially infectious materials (e.g., amniotic, pleural fluid) be disinfected. Fifth, using a single product throughout the facility can simplify both training and appropriate practice. Reasons a lso exist for using a detergent alone on floors because noncritical surfaces contribute minimally to endemic health- care- associated infections 387, and no differences have been found in healthcare -associated infections rates when floors are cleaned with detergent rather than disinfectant 382, 388, 389. However, these studies have been small and of short duration and suffer from low statistical power because the outcome\u2014healthcare- associated infections \u2014is of low frequency. The low rate of infections makes the efficacy of an intervention statistically difficult to demonstrate. Because housekeeping surfaces are assoc iated with the lowest risk for disease transmission, some researchers have suggested that either detergents or a disinfectant/detergent could be used 376. No data exist that show reduced healthcare -associated infection rates with use of surface disinfection of floors, but some data demonstrate reduced microbial lo ad associated with the use of disinfectants. Given this information; other information showing that environmental surfaces (e.g., bedside table, bed rails) close to the patient and in outpatient settings 390 can be contaminated with epidemiologically important microbes (such as VRE and MRSA)47, 390 -394; and data showing these organisms survive on various hospital surfaces 395, 396; some researchers have suggested that such surfaces should be disinfected on a regular schedule 378. Spot decontamination on fabrics that remain in hospitals or clinic rooms while patients move in and out (e.g., privacy curtains) also should be considered. One study demonstrated the effectiveness of spraying the fabric with 3% hydrogen peroxide 397. Future studies should evaluate the level of contamination on noncritical environmental surfaces as a function of high and low hand contact and whether some surfaces (e.g., bed rails) near the patient with high contact frequencies require more frequent disinfection. Regardless of whether a detergent or disinfectant is used on surfaces in a health- care facility, surfaces should be cleaned routinely and when dirty or soiled to provide an aesthetically pleasing environment and to prevent potentially contaminated objects from serving as a source for health- care- associated infections . 398 The value of designing surfaces (e.g. hexyl -polyvinylpyridine) that kill bacteria Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 32 of 163 on contact 399 or have sustained antimicrobial activity 400 should be further evaluated. Several investigators have recognized heavy microbial contamination of wet mops and cleaning cloths and the potential for spread of such contamination 68, 401. They have shown that wiping hard surfaces with contaminated cloths can contaminate hands, equipment, and other surfaces 68, 402. Data have been published that can be used to formulate effective policies for decontamination and maintenance of reusable cleaning cloths. For example, heat was the most reliable treatment of cleaning cloths as a detergent washing followed by drying at 80 \u00b0C for 2 hours produced elimination of contamination. However, the dry heating process might be a fire hazard if the mop head contai ns petroleum -based products or lint builds up within the equipment or vent hose (American Health Care Association, personal communication, March 2003). Alternatively, immersing the cloth in hypochlorite (4,000 ppm) for 2 minutes produced no detectable surv iving organisms in 10 of 13 cloths 403. If reusable cleaning cloths or mops are used, they should be decontaminated regularly to prevent surface contamination during cleaning with subsequent transfer of organisms from these surfaces to patients or equipment by the hands of health- care workers. Some hospitals have begun using a new mopping technique involving microfiber materials to clean floors. Microfibers are densely constructed, polyester and polyamide (nylon) fibers, that are approxim ately 1/16 the thickness of a human hair. The positively charged microfibers attract dust (which has a negative charge) and are more absorbent than a conventional, cotton- loop mop. Microfiber materials also can be wet with disinfectants, such as quaternary ammonium compounds. In one study, t he microfiber system tested demonstrated superior microbial removal compared with conventional string mops when used with a detergent cleaner (94% vs 68%). The use of a disinfectant did not improve the microbial eliminat ion demonstrated by the microfiber system (95% vs 94%). However, use of disinfectant significantly improved microbial removal when a conventional string mop was used (95% vs 68%) (WA Rutala, unpublished data, August 2006). The microfiber system also prevents the possibility of transferring microbes from room to room because a new microfiber pad is used in each room. An important issue concerning use of disinfectants for noncritical surfaces in health- care settings is that the contact time specified on the label of the product is often too long to be practically followed. The labels of most products registered by EPA f or use against HBV, HIV, or M. tuberculosis specify a contact time of 10 minutes. Such a long contact time is not practical for disinfection of environmental surfaces in a health- care setting because most health- care facilities apply a disinfectant and all ow it to dry (~1 minute). Multiple scientific papers have demonstrated significant microbial reduction with contact times of 30 to 60 seconds46-56, 58 -64. In addition, EPA will approve a shortened contact time for any product for which the manufacturers will submit confirmatory efficacy data. Currently, some EPA -registered disinfectants have contact times of one to three minutes. By law, users must follow all applicable label instructions for EPA -registered products. Ideally, product users should consider and use products that have the shor tened contact time. However, disinfectant manufacturers also need to obtain EPA approval for shortened contact times so these products will be used correctly and effectively in the health- care environment. Air Disinfection Disinfectant spray -fog techniques for antimicrobial control in hospital rooms has been used. This technique of spraying of disinfectants is an unsatisfactory method of decontaminating air and surfaces and is not recommended for general infection control in routine patient -care areas386. Disinfect ant fogging is rarely, if ever, used in U.S. healthcare facilities for air and surface disinfection in patient -care areas. Methods (e.g., filtration, ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, chlorine dioxide) to reduce air contamination in the healthcare settin g are discussed in another guideline 23. Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 33 of 163 Microbial Contamination of Disinfectants Contaminated disinfectants and antiseptics have been occasional vehicles of health- care infections and pseudoepidemics for more than 50 years. Published reports describing contaminated disinfectants and antiseptic solutions leading to health- care- associate d infections have been summarized 404. Since this summary additio nal reports have been published 405-408. An examination of reports of disinfectants contaminated with microorganisms revealed noteworthy observations. Perhaps most importantly, high- level disinfectants/liquid chemical sterilants have not been associated with outbreaks due to intrinsic or extrinsic contamination.Members of the genus Pseudomonas (e.g., P. aeruginosa ) are the most frequent isolates from contaminated disinfectants \u2014recovered from 80% of contaminated products. Their ability to remain viable or grow in use- dilutions of disinfectants is unparalleled. This survival advantage for Pseudomonas results presumabl y from their nutritional versatility, their unique outer membrane that constitutes an effective barrier to the passage of germicides, and/or efflux systems 409. Although the concentrated solutions of the disinfectants have not been demonstrated to be contaminated at the point of manufacture, an undiluted phenolic can be contaminated by a Pseudomonas sp. during use 410. In most of the reports that describe illness associated with contaminated disinfectants, the product was used to disinfect patient -care equipment, such as cystoscopes, cardiac catheters, and thermometers. Germicides used as disinfectants that were reported to have been contaminated include chlorhexidine, quaternary ammonium compounds, phenolics, and pine oil. The following control measures should be instituted to reduce the frequency of bacterial growth in disinfectants and the threat of serious healthcare- associated infections from the use of such contaminated products 404. First, some disinfectants should not be diluted; those that are diluted must be prepared correctly to achieve the manufacturers' recommended use- dilution. Second, infection- control professionals must learn from the literature what inappropriate activities resul t in extrinsic contamination (i.e., at the point of use) of germicides and train users to prevent recurrence. Common sources of extrinsic contamination of germicides in the reviewed literature are the water to make working dilutions, contaminated container s, and general contamination of the hospital areas where the germicides are prepared and/or used. Third, stock solutions of germicides must be stored as indicated on the product label. EPA verifies manufacturers' efficacy claims against microorganisms. These measures should provide assurance that products meeting the EPA registration requirements can achieve a certain level of antimicrobial activity when used as directed. Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 34 of 163 Factors Affecting the Efficacy of Disinfection and Sterilization The activity of germicides against microorganisms depends on a number of factors, some of which are intrinsic qualities of the organism, others of which are the chemical and external physical environment. Awareness of these factors should lead to better use of disinfection and sterilization processes and will be briefly reviewed. More extensive consideration of these and other factors is available elsewhere 13, 14, 16, 411 -413. Number and Location of Microorganisms All other conditions remaining constant, the larger the number of microbes, the more time a germicide needs to destroy all of them. Spaulding illustrated this relation when he employed identical test conditions and demonstrated that it took 30 minutes to k ill 10 B. atrophaeus (formerly Bacillus subtilis ) spores but 3 hours to kill 100,000 Bacillus atrophaeus spores. This reinforces the need for scrupulous cleaning of medical instruments before disinfection and sterilization. Reducing the number of microorganisms that must be inactivated through meticulous cleaning, increases the margin of safety when the germicide is used according to the labeling and shortens the exposure time required to kill the entire microbial load. Researchers also have shown that aggr egated or clumped cells are more difficult to inactivate than monodispersed cells 414. The location of microorganisms also must be considered when factors affecting the efficacy of germicides are assessed. Medical instruments with multiple pieces must be disassembled and equipment such as endoscopes that have crevices, joints, and channels are more difficult to disinfect than are flat - surface equipment because penet ration of the disinfectant of all parts of the equipment is more difficult. Only surfaces that directly contact the germicide will be disinfected, so there must be no air pockets and the equipment must be completely immersed for the entire exposure period. Manufacturers should be encouraged to produce equipment engineered for ease of cleaning and disinfection. Innate Resistance of Microorganisms Microorganisms vary greatly in their resistance to chemical germicides and sterilization processes (Figure 1) 342 Intrinsic resistance mechanisms in microorganisms to disinfectants vary. For example, spores are resistant to disinfectants because the spore coat and cortex act as a barrier, mycobacteria have a waxy cell wall that prevents disinfectant entry, and gram -negative bacteria possess an outer membrane that acts as a barrier to the uptake of disinfectants 341, 343 -345. Implicit in all disinfection strategies is the consideration that the most resistant microbial subpopulation controls the sterilization or disinfection time. That is, to destroy the most resistant types of microorganisms (i.e., bacterial spores), the user needs to employ exposure times and a concentration of germicide needed to achieve complete destruction. Except for prions, bacterial spores possess the highest innate resistance to chemical germicides, followed by coccidia (e.g., Cryptosporidium ), mycobact eria (e.g., poliovirus, and coxsackievirus), fungi (e.g., Aspergillus, and Candida), vegetative bacteria (e.g., Staphylococcus, and Pseudomonas ) and lipid or medium -size viruses (e.g., herpes, and HIV). Th e germicidal resistance exhibited by the gram -positive and gram -negative bacteria is similar with some exceptions (e.g., P. aeruginosa which shows greater resistance to some disinfectants) 369, 415, 416. P. aeruginosa also is significantly more resistant to a variety of disinfectants in its \"naturally occurring\" state than are cells subcultured on laboratory media 415, 417. Rickettsiae , Chlamydiae, and mycoplasma cannot be placed in this scale of relative resistance because information about the efficacy of germicides against these agents is limited 418. Because these microorganisms contain lipid and are similar in structure and composition to other bacteria, they can be predicted to be inactivated by the same germicides that destroy lipid viruses and vegetative bacteria. A known exception to this supposit ion is Coxiella burnetti , which has demonstrated resistance to disinfectants 419. Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 35 of 163 Concentration and Potency of Disinfectants With other variables constant, and with one exception (iodophors), the more concentrated the disinfectant, the greater its efficacy and the shorter the time necessary to achieve microbial kill. Generally not recognized, however, is that all disinfectants are not similarly affected by concentration adjustments. For example, quaternary ammonium compounds and phenol have a concentration exponent of 1 and 6, respectively; thus, halving the concentration of a quaternary ammonium compound requires doubling its disinfecting time, but halving the concentration of a phenol solution requires a 64- fold (i.e., 26) increase in its disinfecting time 365, 413, 420. Considering the length of the disinfection time, which depends on the potency of the germicide, also is important. This was illustrated by Spaulding who demonstrated using the mucin- loop test that 70% isopropyl alcohol destroyed 104 M. tuberculosis in 5 minutes, whereas a simultaneous test with 3% phenolic required 2- 3 hours to achieve the same level of microbial kill 14. Physical and Chemical Factors Several physical and chemical factors also influence disinfectant procedures: temperature, pH, relative humidity, and water hardness. For example, the activity of most disinfectants increases as the temperature increases, but some exceptions exist. Furthermore, too great an increase in temperature causes the disinfectant to degrade and weakens its germicidal activity and thus might produce a potential health hazard. An increase in pH improves the antimicrobial activity of some disinfectants (e.g., glutaraldehyde, quaternary ammonium compounds) but decreases the antimicrobial activity of others (e.g., phenols, hypochlorites, and iodine). The pH influences the antimicrobi al activity by altering the disinfectant molecule or the cell surface 413. Relative humidity is the single most important factor influencing the activity of gaseous disinfectants/sterilants, such as EtO, chlorine dioxide, and formaldehyde. Water hardness (i.e., high concentration of divalent cations) reduces the rate of kill of certain disinfectants because divalent cations (e.g., magnesium, calcium) in the hard water interact with the disinfectant to form insoluble precipitates 13, 421. Organic and Inorganic Matter Organic matter in the form of serum, blood, pus, or fecal or lubricant material can interfere with the antimicrobial activity of disinfectants in at least two ways. Most commonly, interference occurs by a chemical reaction between the ger micide and the organic matter resulting in a complex that is less germicidal or nongermicidal, leaving less of the active germicide available for attacking microorganisms. Chlorine and iodine disinfectants, in particular, are prone to such interaction. Alt ernatively, organic material can protect microorganisms from attack by acting as a physical barrier 422, 423. The effects of inorganic contaminants on the sterilization process were studied during the 1950s and 1960s 424, 425. These and other studies show the protection by inorganic contaminants of microorganisms to all sterilization processes results from occlusion in salt crys tals 426, 427. This further emphasi zes the importance of meticulous cleaning of medical devices before any sterilization or disinfection procedure because both organic and inorganic soils are easily removed by washing 426. Duration of Exposure Items must be exposed to the germicide for the appropriate minimum contact time. Multiple investigators have demonstrated the effectiveness of low -level disinfectants against vegetative bacteria (e.g., Listeria , E. coli Salmonella , VRE, ., Candida), mycobacteria (e.g., M. tuberculosis ), and viruses (e.g., poliovirus) at exposure times of 30- 60 seconds 46-64. By law, all Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 36 of 163 applicable label instructions on EPA -registered products must be followed. If the user selects exposure conditions that differ from those on the EPA- registered product label, the user assumes liability for any injuries resulting from off -label use and is potentially subject to enforcement action under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) . All lumens and channels of endoscopic instruments must contact the disinfectant. Air pockets interfere with the disinfection process, and items that float on the disinfectant will not be disinfected. The disinfectant must be introduced reliably into the internal channels of the devi ce. The exact times for disinfecting medical items are somewhat elusive because of the effect of the aforementioned factors on disinfection efficacy. Certain contact times have proved reliable (Table 1), but, in general, longer contact times are more effec tive than shorter contact times. Biofilms Microorganisms may be protected from disinfectants by production of thick masses of cells 428 and extracellular materials, or biofilms 429-435. Biofilms are microbial communities that are tight ly attached to surfaces and cannot be easly removed. Once these masses form, microbes within them can be resistant to disinfectants by multiple mechanisms, including physical characteristics of older biofilms, genotypic variation of the bacteria, microbial production of neutralizing enzymes, and physiologic gradients within the biofilm (e.g., pH). Bacteria within biofilms are up to 1,000 times more resistant to antimicrobials than are the same bacteria in suspension 436. Although new decontamination methods 437 are being investigated for removing biofilms, chlorine a nd monochloramines can effectively inactivate biofilm bacteria 431 438. Investigators have hypothesized that the glycocalyx -like cellular masses on the interior walls of polyvinyl chloride pipe would protect embedded organisms from some disinfectants and be a reservoir for continuous contamination 429, 430, 439. Biofilms have been found in whirlpools 440, dental unit waterlines441, and numerous medical devices (e.g., contact lenses, pacemakers, hemodialysis systems, urinary cath eters, central venous catheters, endoscopes) 434, 436, 438, 442. Their presence can have serious implications for immunoco mpromised patients and patients who have indwelling medical devices. Some enzymes 436, 443, 444 and detergents 436 can degrade biofilms or reduce numbers of viable bacteria within a biofilm, but no products are EPA -registered or FDA -cleared for this purpose. Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 37 of 163 Cleaning Cleaning is the removal of foreign material (e.g., soil, and organic material) from objects and is normally accomplished using water with detergents or enzymatic products. Thorough cleaning is required before high- level disinfection and sterilization because inorganic and organic materials that remain on the surfaces of instruments interfere with the effectiveness of these processes. Also, if soiled materials dry or bake onto the instruments, the removal process becomes more difficult and the disinfection or sterili zation process less effective or ineffective. Surgical instruments should be presoaked or rinsed to prevent drying of blood and to soften or remove blood from the instruments. Cleaning is done manually in use areas without mechanical units (e.g., ultrasonic cleaners or washer - disinfectors) or for fragile or difficult -to-clean instruments. With manual cleaning, the two essential components are friction and fluidics. Friction (e.g., rubbing/scrubbing the soiled area with a brush) is an old and dependable method. Fluidics (i.e., fluids under pressure) is used to remove soil and debris from internal channels after brushing and when the design does not allow passage of a brush through a channel 445. When a washer -disinfector is used, care should be taken in loading instruments: hinged instruments should be opened fully to allow adequa te contact with the detergent solution; stacking of instruments in washers should be avoided; and instruments should be disassembled as much as possible. The most common types of mechanical or automatic cleaners are ultrasonic cleaners, washer - decontami nators, washer -disinfectors, and washer -sterilizers. Ultrasonic cleaning removes soil by cavitation and implosion in which waves of acoustic energy are propagated in aqueous solutions to disrupt the bonds that hold particulate matter to surfaces. Bacterial contamination can be present in used ultrasonic cleaning solutions (and other used detergent solutions) because these solutions generally do not make antibacterial label claims 446. Even though ultrasound alone does not significantly inactivate bacteria, s onication can act synergistically to increase the cidal efficacy of a disinfectant 447. Users of ultrasonic cleaners should be aware that the cleaning fluid could result in endotoxin contamination of surgical instruments, which could cause severe inflammatory reactions 448. Washer -sterilizers are modified steam sterilizers that clean by filling the chamber with water and detergent through which steam passes to provide agitation. Instruments are subsequently rinsed and subjected to a short steam - sterilization cycle. Another washer -sterilizer employs rotating spray arms for a wash cycle followed by a steam sterilization cycle at 285\u00b0F 449, 450. Washer -decontaminators/disinfectors act like a dishwasher that uses a combination of water circulation and detergents to remove soil. These u nits sometimes have a cycle that subjects the instruments to a heat process (e.g., 93\u00baC for 10 minutes) 451. Washer -disinfectors are generally computer -controlled units for cleaning, disinfecting, and drying solid and hollow surgical and medical equipment. In one study, cleaning (measured as 5- 6 log 10 reduc tion) was achieved on surfaces that had adequate contact with the water flow in the machine 452. Detailed information about cleaning and preparing supplies for terminal sterilization is provided by professional organizations 453, 454 and books 455. Studies have shown that manual and mechanical cleaning of endoscopes achieves approximately a 4- log10 reduction of contaminat ing organisms 83, 104, 456, 457. Thus, cleaning alone effectively reduces the number of microorganisms on contaminated equipment. In a quantitative analysis of residual protein contami nation of reprocessed surgical instruments, median levels of residual protein contamination per instrument for five trays were 267, 260, 163, 456, and 756 \u00b5g 458. In another study, the median amount of protein from repr ocessed surgical instruments from different hospitals ranged from 8 \u00b5g to 91 \u00b5g 459. When manual methods were compared with automated methods for cleaning reusable accessory devices used for minimally invasive surgical procedures, the automated method was more efficient for cleaning biopsy forceps and ported and nonported laparoscopic devices and achieved a >99% reduction in soil parameters (i.e., protein, carbohydrate, hemoglobin) in the ported and nonported laparoscopic devices 460, 461 For instrument cleaning, a neutral or near -neutral pH detergent solution commonly is used because such solutions generally provide the best material compatibility profile and good soil removal. Enzymes, Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 38 of 163 usually proteases, sometimes are added to neutral pH solutions to assist in removing organic material. Enzymes in these formulations attack proteins that make up a large portion of common soil (e.g., blood, pus). Cleaning solutions also can contain lipases (enzymes active on fats) and amylases (enzymes activ e on starches). Enzymatic cleaners are not disinfectants, and proteinaceous enzymes can be inactivated by germicides. As with all chemicals, enzymes must be rinsed from the equipment or adverse reactions (e.g., fever, residual amounts of high- level disinfe ctants, proteinaceous residue) could result 462, 463. Enzyme solutions should be used in accordance with manufacturer's instructions, which include proper dilution of the enzymatic detergent and contact with equipment for the amount of time specified on the label 463. Detergent enzymes can result in asthma or other allergic effects in users. Neutral pH detergent solutions that contain enzymes are compatible with metals and other materials used in medical instruments and are the best choice for cleaning delicate medical instruments, especially flexible endoscopes 457. Alkaline - based cleaning agents are used for processing medical devices because they efficiently dissolve protein and fat residues 464; however, they can be corrosive 457. Some data demonstrate that enzymatic cleaners are more effective than neutral detergents 465, 466 in removing microorganisms from surfaces but two more recent studies found no difference in cleaning efficiency between enzymatic and alkaline- based cleaners 443, 464. Another study found no significant difference between enzymatic and non- enzymatic cleaners in terms of microbial cleaning efficacy 467. A new non- enzyme, hydrogen peroxide- based formulation (not FDA-cleared) was as effective as enzymatic cleaners in removing protein, blood, carbohydrate, and endotoxin from surface test carriers468 In addition, this product effected a 5- log10 reduction in microbial loads with a 3- minute exposure at room temperature 468. Although the effectiveness of high- level disinfection and sterilization mandates effective cleaning, no \"real-time\" tests exist that can be emplo yed in a clinical setting to verify cleaning. If such tests were commercially available they could be used to ensure an adequate level of cleaning.469-472 The only way to ensure adequate cleaning is to conduct a reprocessing verification test (e.g., microbiologic sampling), but this is not routinely recommended 473. Validation of the cleaning processes in a laboratory -testing program is possible by microorganism detection, chemical detection for organic contaminants, radionuclide tagging, and chemi cal detection for s pecific ions 426, 471. During the past few years, data have been published describing use of an artificial soil, prot ein, endotoxin, X -ray contrast medium, or blood to verify the manual or automated cleaning process 169, 452, 474 -478 and adenosine triphosphate bioluminescence and microbiologic sampling to evaluate the effectiveness of environmental surface cleaning170, 479. At a minimum, all instruments should be individually inspected and be visibly clean. Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 39 of 163 Disinfection Many disinfectants are used alone or in combinations (e.g., hydrogen peroxide and peracetic acid) in the health- care setting. These include alcohols, chlorine and chlorine compounds, formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, ortho- phthalaldehyde, hydrogen peroxide, iodophors, peracetic acid, phenolics, and quaternary ammonium compounds. Commercial formulations based on these chemicals are considered unique products and must be registered with EPA or cleared by FDA. In most instances, a given product is designed for a specific purpose and is to be used in a certain manner. Therefore, users should read labels carefully to ensure the correct product is selected for the intended use and applied efficiently. Disinfectants are not inter changeable, and incorrect concentrations and inappropriate disinfectants can result in excessive costs. Because occupational diseases among cleaning personnel have been associated with use of several disinfectants (e.g., formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, and c hlorine), precautions (e.g., gloves and proper ventilation) should be used to minimize exposure 318, 480, 481. Asthma and reactive airway disease can occur in sensitized persons exposed to any airborne chemical, including germicides. Clinically important asthma can occur at levels below ceiling levels regulated by OSHA or recommended by NIOSH. The preferred method of control is elimination of the chemical (through engineering controls or substitution) or relocation of the worker. The following overview of the performance characteristics of each provides users with sufficient information to select an appropriate disinfectant for any item and use it in the most efficient way. Chemical Disinfectants Alcohol Overview. In the healthcare setting, \"alcohol\" refers to two water -soluble chemical compounds \u2014ethyl alcohol and isopropyl alcohol \u2014that have generally underrated germicidal characteristics 482. FDA has not cleared any liquid chemical sterilant or high- level disinfectant with alcohol as the main active ingredient. These alcohols are rapidly bactericidal rather than bacteriostatic against vegetative forms of bacteria; they also are tuberculocidal, fungicidal, and virucidal but do not destroy bacterial spores. Their cidal activity drops sharply when diluted below 50% concentration, and the optimum bactericidal concentration is 60% -90% solutions in water (volume/volume) 483, 484. Mode of Action. The most feasible explanation for the antimicrobial action of alcohol is denaturation of proteins. This mechanism is supported by the observation that absolute ethyl alcohol, a dehydrating agent, is less bactericidal than mi xtures of alcohol and water because proteins are denatured more quickly in the presence of water 484, 485. Protein denaturation also is consistent with observations that alcohol destroys the dehydrogenases of Escheri chia coli 486, and that ethyl alcohol increases the lag phase of Enterobacter aerogenes 487 and that the lag phase effect could be reversed by adding certain amino acids. The bacteriostatic action was believed caused by inhibition of the production of metabolites essential for rapid cell division. Microbicidal Activity. Methyl alcohol (methanol) has the weakest bactericidal action of the alcohols and thus seldom is used in healthcare 488. The bactericidal activity of various concentrations of ethyl alcohol (ethanol) was examined against a variety of microorganisms in exposure periods ranging from 10 seconds to 1 hour 483. Pseudomo nas aeruginosa was killed in 10 seconds by all concentrations of ethanol from 30% to 100% (v/v), and Serratia marcescens, E, coli and Salmonella typhosa were killed in 10 seconds by all concentrations of ethanol from 40% to 100%. The gram -positive organism s Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes were slightly more resistant, being killed in 10 seconds by ethyl alcohol concentrations of 60% -95%. Isopropyl alcohol (isopropanol) was slightly more bactericidal than ethyl alcohol for E. coli and S. aur eus 489. Ethyl alcohol, at concentrations of 60% -80%, is a potent virucidal agent inactivating all of the lipophilic viruses (e.g., herpes, vaccinia, and influenza virus) and many hydrophilic viruses (e.g., Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 40 of 163 adenovirus, enterovirus, rhinovirus, and rotaviruses but not hepatitis A virus (HAV) 58 or poliovirus) 49. Isopropyl alcohol is not active against the nonlipid enteroviruses but is fully active against the lipid viruses 72. Studies also have demonstrated the ability of ethyl and isopropyl alcohol to inactivate the hepatitis B virus (HBV) 224, 225 and the herpes virus, 490 and ethyl alcohol to inactivate human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 227, rotavirus, echo virus, and astrovirus 491. In tests of the effect of ethyl alcohol against M. tuberculosis , 95% ethanol killed the tubercle bacilli in sputum or water suspension within 15 seconds 492. In 1964, Spaulding stated that alcohols were the germicide of choice for tuberculocidal activity, and they should be the standard by which all other tuberculocides are compared. For example, he compared the tuberculocidal activity of iodophor (450 ppm), a substituted and isopropanol (70%/volume) using the mucin -loop test (106 M. tuberculosis per loop) and determined the contact times needed for complete destruction were 120- 180 minutes, 45- 60 minutes, and 5 minutes, respectively. The mucin- loop test is a severe test developed to produce long survival times. Thus, these figures should not be extrapolated to the exposure times needed when these germicides are used on medical or surgical material 482. Ethyl alcohol (70%) was the most effective concentration for killing the tissue culture phases of the latter three organisms aerosolized onto various surfaces. The culture phase was more resistant to the action of ethyl alcohol and required about 20 minutes to disinfect the contaminated surface, compared with <1 minute for the tissue phase 493, 494. Isopropyl alcohol (20%) is effective in killing the cysts of Acanthamoeba culbertsoni (560) as are chlorhexidine, hydrogen peroxide, and thimerosal 496. Uses. Alcohols are not recommended for sterilizing medical and surgical materials principally because they lack spor icidal action and they cannot penetrate protein- rich materials. Fatal postoperative wound infections with Clostridium have occurred when alcohols were used to sterilize surgical instruments contaminated with bacterial spores 497. Alcohols have been used effectively to disinfect oral and rectal thermometers498, 499, hospital pagers 500, scissors 501, and stethoscopes have been used to disinfect fiberoptic endoscopes 503, 504 but failure of this disinfectant have lead to infection 280, 505. Alcohol towelettes have been used for years to disinfect small surfaces such as rubber stoppers of multiple- dose medication vials or vaccine bottles. Furthermore, alcohol occasionally is used to disinfect external surfaces of equipment (e.g., stethoscopes, ventilators, manual ventilation bags) 506, CPR manikins 507, ultrasound instruments 508 or medication preparation areas. Two studies demonstrated the effect iveness of 70% isopropyl alcohol to disinfect reusable transducer heads in a controlled environment 509, 510. In contrast, three bloodstream infection outbreaks have been described when alcohol was used to disinfect transducer heads in an intensive- care setting 511. The documented shortcomings of alcohols on equipment are that they damage the shellac mountings of lensed instruments, tend to swell and harden rubber and certain plastic tubing after prolonged and repeated use, bleach rubber and plastic tiles 482 and damage tonometer tips (by deterioration of the glue) after the equivalent of 1 working year of routine use 512. Tonometer biprisms soaked in alcohol for 4 days developed rough front surfaces that potentially could cause corneal damage; this appeared to be caused by weakening of the cementing substances used to fabricate the biprisms 513. Corneal opacification has been reported when tonometer tips were swabbed with al cohol immediately before measurement of intraocular pressure 514. Alcohols are flammable and consequently must be stored in a cool, well -ventilated area. They also evaporate rapidly, making extended exposure time difficult to achieve unless the items are immersed. Chlorine and Chlorine Compounds Overview. Hypochlorites, the most widely used of the chlorine disinfectants, are available as liquid (e.g., sodium hypochlorite) or solid (e.g., calcium hypochlorite). The most prevalent chlorine products in Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 41 of 163 the United States are aqueous solutions of 5.25% -6.15% sodium hypochlorite (see glossary), usually called household bleach. They have a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity, do not leave toxic residues, are unaffected by water hardness , are inexpensive and fast acting 328, remove dried or fixed organisms and biofilms from surfaces465, and have a lo w incidence of serious toxicity 515-517. Sodium hypochlorite at the concentration used in household bleach (5.25- 6.15%) can produce ocular irritation or orophary ngeal, esophageal, and gastric burns 318, 518 -522. Other disadvantages of hypochlorites include corrosiveness to metals in high concentrations (>500 ppm) , inactivation by organic matter, discoloring or \"bleaching\" of fabrics, release of toxic chlorine gas when mixed with ammonia or acid (e.g., household cleaning agents) 523-525, and relative stability 327. The microbicidal activity of chlorine is attributed largely to undissociated hypochlorous acid (HOCl). The dissociation of HOCI to the less microbicidal form (hypochlorite ion OCl-) depends on pH. The disinfecting efficacy of chlorine decreases with an increase in pH that parallels the conversion of undis sociated HOCI to OCl- 329, 526. A potential hazard is production of the carcinogen bis(chloromethyl) ether when hypochlorite solutions contact formaldehyde 527 and the product ion of the animal carcinogen trihalomethane when hot water is hyperchlorinated 528. After reviewing environmental fate and ecologic data, EPA has determined the currently registered uses of hypochlorites will not result in unreasonable adverse effects to the environment 529. Alternative compounds that release chlorine and are used in the health- care setting include demand- release chlorine dioxide, sodium dichloroisocyanurate, and chloramine- T. The advantage of these compounds over the hypochlorites is that they retain chlorine longer and so exert a more prolonged bactericidal effect. Sodium dichloroisocyanurate tablets are stable, and for two reasons, the microbicidal activity of solutions prep ared from sodium dichloroisocyanurate tablets might be greater than that of sodium hypochlorite solutions containing the same total available chlorine. First, with sodium dichloroisocyanurate, only 50% of the total available chlorine is free (HOCl and OCl-), whereas the remainder is combined (monochloroisocyanurate or dichloroisocyanurate), and as free available chlorine is used up, the latter is released to restore the equilibrium. Second, solutions of sodium dichloroisocyanurate are acidic, whereas sodium hypochlorite solutions are alkaline, and the more microbicidal type of chlorine (HOCl) is believed to predominate 530-533. Chlorine dioxide- based disinfectants are prepared fresh as required by mixing the two components (base solution [citric acid with preservatives and corrosion inhibitors] and the activator solution [sodium chlorite]). In vitro suspension tests showed that solutions containing about 140 ppm chlorine dioxide achieved a reduction factor exceeding 106 of S. aureus in 1 minute and of Bacillus atrophaeus spores in 2.5 minutes in the presence of 3 g/L bovine albumin. The potential for damaging equipment requires consideration because long-term use can damage the outer plastic coat of the insertion tube 534. In another study, chlorine dioxide solutions at either 600 ppm or 30 ppm killed Mycobacter ium avium- intracellulare within 60 seconds after contact but contamination by organic material significantly affected the microbicidal properties535. The microbicidal activity of a new disinfectant, \"superoxidized water,\" has been examined The concept of electrolyzing saline to create a disinfectant or antiseptics is appealing because the basic materials of saline and electricity are inexpensive and the end product (i.e., water) does not damage the environment. The main products of this water are hypochlorous acid (e.g., at a concentration of about 144 mg/L) and chlorine. As with any germicide, the antimicrobial activity of superoxidized water is strongl y affected by the concentration of the active ingredient (available free chlorine) 536. One manufacturer generates the disinfectant at the point of use by passing a saline solution over coated titanium electrodes at 9 amps. The product generated has a pH of 5.0 -6.5 and an oxidation- reduction potential (redox) of >950 mV. Although superoxidized water is intended to be generated fresh at the point of use, when tested u nder clean conditions the disinfectant was effective within 5 minutes when 48 hours old 537. Unfortunately, the equipment required to produce the product can be expensive because parameters such as pH, current, and redox potential must be closely monitored. The solution is nontoxic to biologic tissues. Although the United Kingdom manufacturer claims the solution is noncorrosive and nondamaging to endoscopes and processing equipment, one flexible endoscope manufacturer (Olympus Key -Med, United Kingdom) has voided the warranty on the endoscopes if superoxidized water is used to disinfect them 538. As with an y germicide formulation, the user should check with the device Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 42 of 163 manufacturer for compatibility with the germicide. Additional studies are needed to determine whether this solution could be used as an alternative to other disinfectants or antiseptics for hand washing, skin antisepsis, room cleaning, or equipment disinfection (e.g., endoscopes, dialyzers) 400, 539, 540. In October 2002, the FDA cleared superoxidized water as a high- level disinfectant (FDA, personal communication, September 18, 2002). Mode of Action. The exact mechanism by which free chlorine destroys microorganisms has not been elucidated. Inactivation by chlorine can result from a number of factors: oxidation of sulfhydryl enzymes and amino acids; chlorination of amino acids; loss of intracellul ar contents; decreased uptake of nutrients; inhibition of protein decreased adenosine triphosphate production; breaks in DNA; and depressed DNA synthesis 329, 347. The actual microbicidal mechanism of chlorine might involve a combination of these fa ctors or the effect of chlorine on critical sites 347. Microbicidal Activity. Low concentrations of free available chlorine (e.g., HOCl, OCl-, and elemental chlorine- Cl2) have a biocidal mycoplasma (25 ppm) and vegetative bacteria (<5 ppm) in seconds in the absence of an organic load 329, 418. Higher concentrations (1,000 ppm) of chlorine are required to kill M. tuberculosis using the Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) tuberculocidal test 73. A concentration of 100 ppm will kill 99.9% of B. atrophaeus spores within 5 minutes 541, 542 and destroy mycotic agents in <1 hour 329. Acidified bleach and regular bleach (5,000 ppm chlorine) can inactivate 106 Clostridium difficile spores in 10 minutes 262. One study reported that 25 different viruses were inactivated in 10 minutes with 200 ppm available chlorine 72. Several studies ha ve demonstrated the effectiveness of diluted sodium hypochlorite and other disinfectants to i nactivate HIV 61. Chlorine (500 ppm) showed inhibition of Candida after 30 seconds of exposure 54. In experiments using the AOAC Use- Dilution Method, 100 ppm of free chlorine killed S. aureus , Salmonella choleraesuis , and P. aeruginosa in <10 minutes 327. Because contains 5.25% -6.15% sodium or 52,500 -61,500 dilution -62 ppm available chlorine, and a 1:10 dilution of household bleach provides about 5250- 6150 ppm . Data are available for manufacturers' bactericidal, fungicidal, sporici dal, tuberculocidal, and virucidal label claims 543-546. A chlorine dioxide generator has been shown effective for decontaminating flexible endoscopes 534 but it is not currently FDA -cleared for use as a high- level disinfectant 85. Chlorine dioxi de can be produced by mixing solutions, such as a solution of chlorine with a solution of sodium chlorite 329. In 1986, a chlorine dioxide product was voluntarily removed from the market when its use caused leakage of cellulose- based dialyzer membranes, which allowed bacteria to migrate from the dialysis fluid side of the dialyzer to the blood si de 547. Sodium dichloroisocyanurate at 2,500 ppm available chlorine is effective against bacteria in the presence of up to 20% plasma, compared with 10% plasma for sodium hypochlorite at 2,500 ppm 548. \"Superoxidized water\" has been tested against bacteria, mycobacteria, viruses, fungi, and spores 537, 539, 549. Freshly generated superoxidized water is rapidly effective (<2 minutes) in achieving a 5- log10 reduction of pat hogenic microorganisms (i.e., M. tuberculosis , M. chelonae , poliovirus, , Enterococcus faecalis, P. aeruginosa) in the absence of organic loading. However, the biocidal activity of this disinfect ant decreased substantially in the presence of organic material (e.g., 5% horse serum) 537, 549, 550. No bacteria or viruses were detected on artificially contaminated endoscopes after a 5- minute exposure to superoxidized water 551 and HBV -DNA was not detected from any endoscope experimentally contaminated with HBV -positive mixed sera after a disinfectant exposure time of 7 minutes552. Uses. Hypochlorites are widely used in healthcare facilities in a variety of settings. 328 Inorganic chlorine solution is used for disinfecting tonometer heads 188 and for spot -disinfection of counter tops and floors. A 1:10- 1:100 dilution of 5.25% -6.15% sodium hypochlorite (i.e., household bleach) 22, 228, 553, 554 or Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 43 of 163 an EPA -registered tuberculocidal disinfectant 17has been recommended for decontaminating blood spills. For small spills of blood (i.e., drops of blood) on noncritical surfaces, t he area can be disinfected with a 1:100 dilution of 5.25% -6.15% hypochlorites and other germicides are substantially inact ivated in the presence of blood 63, 548, 555, 556, large spills of blood require that the surface be cleaned bef ore an EPA -registered disinfectant or a 1:10 (final concentration) solution of household bleach is applied 557. If a sharps injury is possible, the surface initially should be decontaminated 69, 318, then cleaned and disinfected (1:10 final concentration) 63. Extreme care always should be taken to prevent percutaneous injury. At least 500 ppm available chlorine for 10 minutes is recommended for decontaminating CPR training manikins 558. Full-strength bleach has been recommended for self -disinfection of needles and syringes used for illicit -drug injection when needle- exchange programs are not available. The difference in the recommended concentrations of bleach reflects the difficulty of c leaning the interior of needles and syringes and the use of needles and syringes for parenteral injection 559. Clinicians shou ld not alter their use of chlorine on environmental surfaces on the basis of testing methodologies that do not simulate actual disinfection practices 560, 561. Other uses in healthcare include as an irrigating agent in endodontic treatment 562 and as a disinfectant for manikins, laundry, dental appliances, hydrotherapy tanks 23, 41, regulated medical waste before disposal 328, and the water distribution system in hemodialysis centers and hemodialysis machines 563. Chlorine long has been used as the disinfectant in water treatment. Hyperchlorination of a Legionella- contaminated hospital water system 23 resulted in a dramatic decrease ( from 30% to 1.5%) in the isolation of L. pneumophila from w ater outlets and a cessation of healthcare- associated Legionnaires' disease in an affected unit 528, 564. Water disinfection with monochloramine by municipal water -treatment plants substantially reduced the risk for healt hcare- associated Legionnaires disease 565, 566. Chlorine dioxide also has been used to control Legionella in a hospital water supply. 567 Chloramine T 568 and hypochlorites 41 have been used to disinfect hydrotherapy equipment. Hypochlorite solutions in tap water at a pH >8 stored at room temperature (23\u00baC) in closed, opaque plastic containers can lose up to 40% -50% of their free available chlorine level over 1 month. Thus, if a user wished to have a solution containing 500 ppm of available chlorine at day 30, he or she should prepare a solution containing 1,000 ppm of chlorine at time 0. Sodium hypochlorite solution does not decompose after 30 days when stored in a closed brown bottle 327. The use of powders, composed of a mixture of a chlorine- releasing agent with highly absorbent resin, for disinfecting spills of body fluids has been evaluated by laboratory tests and hospital ward trials. The inclusion of acrylic resin particles in formulations markedly increases the volume of fluid that can be soaked up because the resin can absorb 200- 300 times its own weight of fluid, depending on the fluid consistency. When experimental formulations containing 1%, 5%, and 10% available chlorine were evaluated by a standardized surface test, those containing 10% demonstrated bactericidal activity. One problem with chlorine- releasing granules is that they can generate chlorine fumes when applied to urine 569. Formaldehyde Overview. Formaldehyde is used as a disinfectant and sterilant in both its liquid and gaseous states. Liquid formaldehyde will be considered briefly in this section, and the gaseous form is reviewed elsewhere 570. Formaldehyde is sold and used principally as a water -based solution called formalin, which is 37% formaldehyde by weight. The aqueous solution is a bactericide, tuberculocide, fungicide, virucide and sporicide 72, 82, 571 -573. OSHA indicated that formaldehyde should be handled in the workplace as a potential carcinogen and set an employee exposure standard for formaldehyde that limits an 8- hour time- weighted average exposure concentration of 0.75 ppm 574, 575. The standard includes a second permissible exposure limit in the form of a short -term exposure limit (STEL) of 2 ppm that is the maximum exposure all owed during a 15- minute period 576. Ingestion of formaldehyde can be fatal, and long- term exposure to low levels in the air or on the skin can cause asthma- like respiratory problems and skin irritation , such as dermatitis and itching. For these reasons, employees should have limited direct contact Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 44 of 163 with formaldehyde, and these considerations limit its role in sterilization and disinfection processes. Key provisions of the OSHA standard that protects workers from exposure to formaldehyde appear in Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 1910.1048 (and equivalent regulations in states with OSHA- approved state plans) 577. Mode of Action. Formaldehyde inactivates microorganisms by alkylating the amino and sulfhydral groups of proteins and ring nitrogen atoms of purine bases 376. Microbicidal Activity. Varying concentrations of aqueous formaldehyde solutions destroy a wide range of microorganisms. Inactivation of poliovirus in 10 minutes required an 8% concentration of formalin, but all other viruses tested were inactivated with 2% formalin 72. Four percent formaldehyde is a tuberculocidal agent, inactivating 104 M. tuberculosis in 2 minutes 82, and 2.5% formaldehyde inact ivated about 107 Salmonella Typhi in 10 minutes in the presence of organic matter 572. The sporicidal action of formaldehyde was slower than that of glutaral dehyde in comparative tests with 4% aqueous formaldehyde and 2% glutaraldehyde against the spores of B. anthracis 82. The formaldehyde solution required 2 hours of contact to achieve an inactivation factor of 104, whereas glutaraldehyde required only 15 minutes. Uses. Although formaldehyde- alcohol is a chemical sterilant and formaldehyde is a high- level disinfectant, the health- care uses of formaldehyde are limited by its irritating fumes and its pungent odor even at very low levels (<1 ppm). For these reasons and other s\u2014such as its role as a suspected human carcinogen linked to nasal cancer and lung cancer 578, this germicide is excluded from Table 1. When it is used, , direct exposure to employees g enerally is limited; however, excessive exposures to formaldehyde have been documented for employees of renal transplant units 574, 579, and student s in a gross anatomy laboratory 580. Formaldehyde is used in the health- care setting to prepare viral vaccines (e.g., poliovir us and influenza); as an embalming agent; and to preserve anatomic specimens; and historically has been used to sterilize surgical instruments, especially when mixed with ethanol. A 1997 survey found that formaldehyde was used for reprocessing hemodialyzer s by 34% of U.S. hemodialysis centers \u2014a 60% decrease from 1983 249, 581. If used at room temperature, a concentration of 4% with a minimum exposure of 24 hours is required to disinfect disposable hemodialyzers reused on the same patient 582, 583. Aqueous formaldehyde solutions (1% -2%) also have been used to disinfect the internal fluid pathways of dialysis machines 583. To minimiz e a potential health hazard to dialysis patients, the dialysis equipment must be thoroughly rinsed and tested for residual formaldehyde before use. Paraformaldehyde, a solid polymer of formaldehyde, can be vaporized by heat for the gaseous decontaminatio n of laminar flow biologic safety cabinets when maintenance work or filter changes require access to the sealed portion of the cabinet. Glutaraldehyde Overview. Glutaraldehyde is a saturated dialdehyde that has gained wide acceptance as a high- level disinfectant and chemical sterilant 107. Aqueous solutions of glutaraldehyde are acidic and generally in this state are not sporicidal. Only when the solution is \"activated\" (made alkaline) by use of alkalinating agents to pH 7.5 -8.5 does the solution become sporicidal. Once activated, these solutions have a shelf -life of minimally 14 days because of the polymerization of the glutaraldehyde molecules at alkaline pH levels. This polymerization bl ocks the active sites (aldehyde groups) of the glutaraldehyde molecules that are responsible for its biocidal activity. Novel formulations alkaline glutaraldehyde) produced in the past 30 years have overcome the problem of rapid loss of activity (e.g., use- life 28 -30 days) while generally maintaining excellent microbicidal activity 584-588. However, antimicrobial activity depends not only on age but also on use conditions, such as dilution and organic stress. Manufacturers' literature for these preparations suggests the neutral or alkaline glutaraldehydes possess microbicidal and anticorrosion properties superior to Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 45 of 163 those of acid glutaraldehydes, and a few published reports substantiate these claims 542, 589, 590. However, two studies found no difference in the microbicidal activity of alkaline and acid glutaraldehydes 73, 591. The use of glutaraldehyde- based solutions in health- care facilities is widespread because of their advantages, including excellent biocidal properties; activity in the presence of organic matter (20% bovine serum); and noncor rosive action to endoscopic equipment, thermometers, rubber, or plastic equipment (Tables 4 and 5). Mode of Action. The biocidal activity of glutaraldehyde results from its alkylation of sulfhydryl, hydroxyl, carboxyl, and amino groups of microorganisms, which alters RNA, DNA, and protein synthesis. The mechanism of action of glutaraldehydes are reviewed extensively els ewhere 592, 593. Microbicidal Activity. The in vitro inactivation of microorganisms by glutaraldehydes has been extensively investigated and reviewed 592, 593. Several investigators showed that 2% aqueous solutions of glutaraldehyde, buffered to pH 7.5 -8.5 with sodium bicarbonate effectively killed vegetative bacteria in <2 minutes; M. tuberculosis , fungi, and viruses in <10 minutes; and spores of Bacillus and Clostridium species in 3 hours 542, 592 -597. Spores of C. d ifficile are more rapidly killed by 2% glutaraldehyde than are spores of other species of Clostridium and Bacillus 79, 265, 266. Microorganisms with substantial resistance to glutaraldehyde have been reported, including som e 0.2% glutaraldehyde solution used to store porcine prosthetic heart valves 604. Two percent alkaline glutaraldehyde solution inactivated 105 M. tuberculosis cells on the surface of penicylinders within 5 minutes at 18\u00baC 589. However, subsequent studies82 questioned the mycobactericidal prowess of glutaraldehydes. Two percent alkaline glutaraldehyde has slow action (20 to >30 minutes) against M. tuberculosis and compares unfavorably with alcohols, formaldehydes, iodine, and phenol 82. Suspensions of M. avium, M. intracellulare, and M. gordonae were more resistant to inactivation by a 2% alkaline glutaraldehyde (estimated time to complete inactivation: ~60 minutes) than were virulent M. tuberculosis (estimated time to complete inactivation ~25 minutes) 605. The rate of kill was directly proportional to the temperature, and a standardized suspension of M. tuberculosis could not be sterilized within 10 minutes 84. An FDA -cleared chemical sterilant containing 2.5% glutaraldehyde uses increased temperature (35\u00baC) to reduce the time required to achieve high- level disinfection (5 minutes) 85, 606, but its use is limited to automatic endoscope reprocessors equipped with a heater. In another study employing membrane filters for measurement of mycobactericidal activity of 2% alkaline glutaraldehyde, complete inactivation was achieved within 20 minutes at 20\u00baC when the test inoculum was 106 M. tuberculosis per membrane 81. Several investigators 55, 57, 73, 76, 80, 81, 84, 605 have demonstrated that glutaraldehyde solutions inactivate 2.4 to >5.0 log 10 of M. tuberculos is in 10 minutes (including multidrug- resistant M. tuberculosis ) and 4.0- 6.4 log 10 of M. tuberculosis in 20 minutes. On the basis of these data and other studies, 20 minutes at room temperature is considered the minimum exposure time needed to reliably kill Mycobacteria and other vegetative bacteria with 2% glutaraldehyde 17, 19, 27, 57, 83, 94, 108, 111, 117 - 121, 607. Glutaraldehyde is commonly diluted during use, and studies showed a glutaral dehyde concentration decline after a few days of use in an automatic endoscope washer 608, 609. The decline occurs because instruments are not thoroughly dried and water is carried in with the instrument, which increases the solution's volume and dilutes its effective concentration 610. This emphasizes the need to ensure that semicritical equipment is disinfected with an acceptable concentration of glutaraldehyde. Data suggest that 1.0% -1.5% glutaraldehyde is the mi nimum effective concentration for >2% glutaraldehyde solutions when used as a high- level disinfectant 76, 589, 590, 609. Chemical test strips or liquid chemical monitors 610, 611 are available for deter mining whether an effective concentration of glutaraldehyde is present despite repeated use and dilution. The frequency of testing should be based on how frequently the solutions are used (e.g., used daily, test daily; used weekly, test before use; used 30 times per day, test each 10 th use), but the strips should not be used to extend the use life beyond the expiration date. Data suggest the Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 46 of 163 chemicals in the test strip deteriorate with time 612 and a manufacturer's expiration date should be placed on the bottles. The bottle of test strips should be dated when opened and used for the period of time indicated on the bottle (e.g., 120 days). The results of test strip monitoring should be documented. The glutaraldehyde test kits have been preliminarily evaluated for accuracy and range 612 but the reliabilit y has been questioned 613. To ensure the presence of minimum effective concentration of the high- level disinfectant, manufacturers of some chemical test strips recommend the use of quality -control procedures to ensure the strips perform properly. If the manufacturer of the chem ical test strip recommends a quality - control procedure, users should comply with the manufacturer's recommendations. The concentration should be considered unacceptable or unsafe when the test indicates a dilution below the product's minimum effective conc entration (MEC) (generally to 1.0% -1.5% glutaraldehyde) by sodium phenate when diluted 1:16 is not recommended as a high- level disinfectant because it lacks bactericidal activity in the presence of organic matter and lacks tuberculocidal, fungicidal, virucidal, and sporicidal activity 49, 55, 56, 71, 73-79, 614. In December 1991, EPA issued an order to stop the sale of all batches of this product because of efficacy data showing the product is not effective against spores and possibly other microorganisms or inanimate objects as claimed on the label 615. FDA has cleared a glutaraldehyde -phenol/phenate concentrate as a high- level disinfectant that contains 1.12% glutaraldehyde with 1.93% phenol/phenate at its use concentration. cleared glutaraldehyde sterilants that contain 2.4% -3.4% glutaraldehyde are used undiluted 606. Uses. Glutaraldehyde is used most commonly as a high- level disinfectant for medic al equipment such as endoscopes 69, 107, 504, spirometry tubing, dialyzers 616, transducers, anesthesia and respiratory therapy equipment 617, hemodialysis proportioning and dialysate delivery systems 249, 618, and reuse of laparosc opic disposable plastic trocars 619. Glutaraldehyde is noncorrosive to metal and does not damage lensed instruments, rubber . or plastics. Glutaraldehyde should not be used for cleaning noncritical surfaces because it is too toxic and expensive. Colitis believed caused by glutaraldehyde exposure from residual disinfecting solution in endoscope solution channels has been reported and is preventable by careful endoscope rinsing 318, 620 -630. One study found that residual glutaraldehyde levels were higher and more variable after manual disinfection (<0.2 mg/L to 159.5 mg/L) than after automatic disinfection (0.2- 6.3 mg/L)631. Similarly, keratopathy and corneal decompensation were caused by ophthalmic instruments that were inadequately rinsed aft er soaking in 2% glutaraldehyde 632, 633. Healthcare personnel can be exposed to elevated levels of glutaraldehyde vapor when equipment is processed in poorly ventilated rooms, when spills occur, when glutaraldehyde solutions are activated or changed,634, or when open immersion baths are used. Acute or chronic exposure can result in skin irritation or dermatitis, mucous membrane irritation (eye, nose , mouth), or pulmonary sy mptoms 318, 635-639. Epistaxis, allergic contact dermatitis, asthma, and rhinitis also have been reported in healthcare workers exposed to glutaraldehyde 636, 640-647. Glutaraldehyde exposure should be monitored to ensure a safe work environment. Testing can be done by four techniques: a silica gel tube/gas chromatography cassette/high- performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with an ultraviolet (UV) detector, a passive badge/HPLC, or a handheld glutaraldehyde air monitor 648. The silica gel tube and the DNPH -impregnated cassette are suitable for monitoring the 0.05 ppm ceiling limit. The passive badge, with a 0.02 ppm limit of detection, is considered marginal at the Americal Council of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) ceiling level. The ceiling lev el is considered too close to the glutaraldehyde meter's 0.03 ppm limit of detection to provide confidence in the readings 648. ACGIH does not require a specific monitoring schedule for glutaraldehyde; however, a monitoring schedule is needed to ensure the level is less than the ceiling limit. For example, monitoring Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 47 of 163 should be done initially to determine glutaraldehyde levels, af ter procedural or equipment changes, and in response to worker co mplaints 649. In the absence of an OSHA permissible exposure limit, if the glutaraldehyde level is higher than the ACGIH ceiling limit of 0.05 ppm, corrective action and repeat monitoring would be prudent 649. Engineering and work -practice controls that can be used to resolve these problems include ducted exhaust hoods, air systems that provide 7 -15 air exchanges per hour, ductless fume hoods with absorbents for the glutaraldehyde vapor, tight -fitting lids on im mersion baths, personal protection (e.g., nitrile or butyl rubber gloves but not natural latex gloves, goggles) to minimize skin or mucous membrane contact, and automated endoscope processors 7, 650. If engineering controls fail to maintain levels below the ceiling limit, institutions can consider the us e of respirators (e.g., a half -face respirator with organic vapor cartridge 640 or a type \"C\" supplied air respirator with a full facepiece operated in a positive pressure mode) 651. In general, engineering controls are preferred over work -practice and administrative controls because they do not req uire active participation by the health- care worker. Even though enforcement of the OSHA ceiling limit was suspended in 1993 by the U.S. Court of Appeals 577, limiting employee exposure to 0.05 ppm (according to ACGIH) is prudent because, at this level, glutaraldehyde can irritate the eyes, throat, and nose 318, 577, 639, 652. If glutaraldehyde disposal through the sanitary sewer system is restricted, sodium bisulfate can be used to neutrali ze the glutaraldehyde and make it safe for disposal. Hydrogen Peroxide Overview. The literature contains several accounts of the properties, germicidal effectiveness, and potential uses for stabilized hydrogen peroxide in the health- care setting. Published reports ascribe good germicidal activity to hydrogen peroxide and attest to its bactericidal, virucidal, sporicidal, and fungicidal properties 653-655. (Tables 4 and 5) The FDA website lists cleared liquid chemical sterilants and high- level disinfectants containing hydrogen peroxide and their cleared contact conditions. Mode of Action. Hydrogen peroxide works by producing destructive hydroxyl free radicals that can attack membrane lipids, DNA, and other essential cell components. Catalase, produced by aerobic organisms and facultative anaerobes that possess cytochrome systems, can protec t cells from metabolically produced hydrogen peroxide by degrading hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen. This defense is overwhelmed by the concentrations used for disinfection 653, 654. Microbicidal Activity. Hydrogen peroxide is active against a wide range of microorganisms, including bacteria, yeasts, fungi, viruses, and spores 78, 654. A 0.5% accelerated hydrogen peroxide demonstrated bac tericidal and virucidal activity in 1 minute and mycobactericidal and fungicidal activity in 5 minutes 656. Bactericidal effectiveness and stability of hydrogen peroxide in urine has been demonstrated against a variety of health- care- associated pathogens; organisms with high cellular catalase ac tivity (e.g., S. aureus , S. marcescens , and Proteus mirabilis ) required 30- 60 minutes of exposure to 0.6% hydrogen peroxide for a 108 reduction in cell counts, whereas organisms with lower catalase activity (e.g., E. coli, S treptococcus species, and Pseudo monas species) required only 15 minutes' exposure 657. In an investigation of 3%, 10%, and 15% hydrogen peroxide for reducing spacecraft bacterial populations, a complete kill of 106 spores (i.e., Bacillus species) occurred with a 10% concentration and a 60- minute expos ure time. A 3% concentration for 150 minutes killed 106 spores in six of seven exposure trials 658. A 10% hydrogen peroxide solution resulted in a 103 decrease in B. atrophaeus spores, and a 105 decrease when tested against 13 other pathogens in 30 minutes at 20\u00baC 659, 660. A 3.0% hydrogen peroxide solution was ineffective against VRE after 3 and 10 minutes exposure times 661 and caused only a 2- log10 reduction in the number of Acanthamoeba cysts in approximately 2 hours 662. A 7% stabilized hydrogen peroxide proved to be sporicidal (6 hours of exposure), mycobactericidal (20 minutes), fungicidal (5 minutes) at full strength, virucidal (5 minutes) and bactericidal (3 minutes) at a 1:16 dilution when a quantitative carrier test was used 655. The 7% solution of hydrogen peroxide, tested after 14 days of stress (in the form of germ -loaded carriers and respiratory therapy equipment), was sporicidal (>7 log 10 reduction in 6 hours), mycobactericidal (>6.5 log 10 reduction in 25 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 48 of 163 minutes), fungicidal (>5 log 10 reduction in 20 minutes), bactericidal (> 6 log 10 reduction in 5 minutes) and virucidal (5 log 10 reduction in 5 minutes) 663. Synergistic sporicidal effects were observed when spores were exposed to a combination of hydr ogen peroxide (5.9% -23.6%) and peracetic acid 664. Other studies demonstrated the antiviral activity of hydrogen peroxide against rhinovirus 665. The time required for inactivating three serotypes of rhinovirus using a 3% hydrogen peroxide solution was 6- 8 minutes; this time increased with decreasing concentrations (18- 20 minutes at 1.5%, 50- 60 minutes at 0.75%). Concentrations of hydrogen peroxide from 6% to 25% show promise as chemical sterilants. The product marketed as a sterilant is a premixed, ready -to-use chemical that contains 7.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.85% phosphoric acid (to maintain a low pH) 69. The mycobactericidal activity of 7.5% hydrogen peroxide has been corroborated in a study showing the inactivation of >105 multidrug -resistant M. tuberculosis after a 10- minute exposure 666. Thirty minutes were required for >99.9% inactivation of poliovirus and HAV 667. Three percent and 6% hydrogen peroxide were unable to inactivate HAV in 1 minute in a carrier test 58. When the effectiveness of 7.5% hydrogen peroxide at 10 minutes was compared with 2% alkaline glutaraldehyde at 20 minutes in manual disinfection of endoscopes, no significant difference in germicidal activity was observed 668. ). No complaints were received from the nursing or medical staff regarding odor or toxicity. In one study, 6% hydrogen peroxide (unused product was 7.5%) was more effective in the high- level disinfection of flexible endoscopes than was the 2% glutaraldehyde solution 456. A new, rapid- acting 13.4% hydrogen peroxide formulation (that is not yet FDA-cleared) has demonstrated sporicidal, mycobactericidal, fungicidal, and virucidal efficacy. Manufacturer data demonstrate that this solution sterilizes in 30 minutes and provides high- level disinfection in 5 minutes669. This product has not been used long enough to evaluate material compatibility to endoscopes and other semicritical devices, and further assessment by instrument manufacturers is needed. Under normal conditions, hydrogen peroxide is extremely stable when properly stored (e.g., in dark containers). The decomposition or loss of potency in small containers is less than 2% per year at ambient temperatures 670. Uses. Commercially available 3% hydrogen peroxide is a stable and effective disinfectant when used on inanimate surfaces. It has been used in concentrations from 3% to 6% for disinfecting soft contact lenses (e.g., 3% for 2- 3 hrs) 653, 671, 672, tonometer biprisms 513, ventilators 673, fabrics 397, and endoscopes 456. Hydrogen peroxide was effective in spot -disinfec ting fabrics in patients' rooms 397. Corneal damage from a hydrogen peroxide- soaked tonometer tip that was not pr operly rinsed has been reported 674. Hydrogen peroxide also has been instilled into urinary drainage bags in an attempt to eliminate the bag as a source of bladder bacteriuria and environmental contamination 675. Although the instillation of hydrogen peroxide into the bag reduced microbial contamination of the bag, this procedure did not reduce the incidence of catheter -associated bacteriuria 675. A chemical irritation resembling pseudomembranous colitis caused by either 3% hydrogen peroxide or a 2% glutaraldehyde has been reported 621. An epidemic of pseudomembrane- like enteritis and colitis in seven patients in a gastrointestinal endoscopy unit also has been associated with inadequate rinsing of 3% hydrogen peroxide from the endoscope 676. As with other chemical sterilants, dilution of the hydrogen peroxide must be monitored by regularly testing the minimum effective concentration (i.e., 7.5% -6.0%). Compatibility testing by Olympus America of the 7.5% hydrogen peroxide found both cosmetic changes (e.g., discoloration of black anodized metal finishes) 69 and functional changes with the tested endoscopes (Olympus, written communication, October 15, 1999). Iodophors Overview. Iodine solutions or tinctures long have been used by health professionals primarily as antiseptics on skin or tissue. Iodophors, on the other hand, have been used both as antiseptics and Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 49 of 163 disinfectants. FDA has not cleared any liquid chemical sterilant or high- level disinfectants with iodophors as the main active ingredient. An iodophor is a combination of iodine and a solubilizing agent or carrier; the resulting complex provides a sustained- release reservoir of iodine and releases small amounts of free iodi ne in aqueous solution. The best -known and most widely used iodophor is povidone- iodine, a compound of polyvinylpyrrolidone with iodine. This product and other iodophors retain the germicidal efficacy of iodine but unlike iodine generally are nonstaining a nd relatively free of toxicity and irritancy 677, 678. Several reports that documented intrinsic microbial contamination antiseptic formulations of povidone- iodine and poloxamer -iodine 679-681 caused a reappraisal of the chemistry and use of iodophors682. \"Free\" iodine (I 2) contributes to the bactericidal activity of iodophors and dilutions of iodophors demonstrate more rapid bactericidal action than does a full -strength povidone- iodine solution. The reason for the observation that dilution increases bactericidal activity is unclear, but dilution of povidone- iodine might weaken the iodine linkage to the carrier polymer with an accompanying increase of free iodine in solution 680. Therefore, iodophors must be diluted according to the manufacturers' directions to achieve antimicrobial activity. Mode of Action. Iodine can penetrate the cell wall of microorganisms quickly, and the lethal effects are believed to result from disruption of protein and nucleic acid structure and synthesis. Microbicidal Activity. Published reports on the in vitro antimicrobial efficacy of iodophors demonstrate that iodophors are bactericidal, mycobactericidal, and virucidal but can require prolonged contact times to kill certain fungi and bacterial spores 14, 71-73, 290, 683 -686. Three brands of povidone- iodine solution have demonstrated more rapid kill (seconds to minutes) of S. aureus and M. chelonae at a 1:100 dilution than did the stock solution 683. The virucidal activity of 75- 150 ppm available iodine was demonstrated against seven viruses 72. Other investigators have questioned the efficacy of iodophors against poliovirus in the presence of organic matter 685and rotavirus SA-11 in distilled or tapwater 290. Manufacturers' data demonstrate that commercial iodophors are not , but they are and bactericidal at their recommended use- dilution. Uses. Besides their use as an antiseptic, iodophors have been used for disinfecting blood culture bottles and medical equipment, such as hydrotherapy tanks, thermometers, and endoscopes. Antiseptic iodophors are not suitable for use as hard- surface disinfectants because of concentration differences. Iodophors formulated as antiseptics contain less free iodine than do those formulated as disinfectants 376. Iodine or iodine- based antiseptics should not be used on silicone catheters because they can adversely affect the silicone tubing 687. Ortho -phthalaldehyde (O PA) Overview. Ortho- phthalaldehyde is a high -level disinfectant that received FDA clearance in October 1999. It contains 0.55% 1,2 -benzenedicarboxaldehyde ( OPA) . OPA solution is a clear, pale- blue liquid with a pH of 7.5. (Tables 4 and 5) Mode of Action. Preliminary studies on the mode of action of OPA suggest that both OPA and glutaraldehyde interact with amino acids, proteins, and microorganisms. However, OPA is a less potent cross- linking agent. This is compensated for by the lipophilic aromatic nature of OPA that is likely to assist its uptake through the outer layers of mycobacteria and gram -negative bacteria 688-690. OPA appears to kill spores by blocking the spore germination process 691. Microbicidal Activity. Studies have demonstrated excellent microbicidal activity in vitro 69, 100, 271, 400, 692-703. For example, OPA has superior mycobactericidal activity (5- log10 reduction in 5 minutes) to glutaraldehyde. The mean times required to produce a 6- log10 reduction for M. bovis using 0.21% OPA was 6 minutes, compared with 32 minutes using 1.5% glutaraldehyde 693. OPA showed good activity against the mycobacteria tested, including the glutar aldehyde -resistant strains, but 0.5% OPA was not sporicidal with 270 minutes of exposure. Increasing the pH from its unadjusted level (about 6.5) to pH 8 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 50 of 163 improved the sporicidal activity of OPA 694. The level of biocidal activity was directly related to the temperature. A greater than 5- log10 reduction of B. atrophaeus spores was observed in 3 hours at 35\u00baC, than in 24 hours at 20\u00baC. Also, with an exposure time 5 minutes, biocidal activity decreased with increasing serum concentration. However, efficacy did not differ when the exposure time was 10 minutes 697. In addition, OPA is effective (>5- log10 reduction) against a wide range of microorganisms, including glutaraldehyde- resistant mycobacteria and B. atrophaeus spores 694. The influence of laboratory adaptation of test strains, such as P. aeruginosa, to 0.55% OPA has been evaluated. Resistant and multiresistant strains increased substantially in susceptibility to OPA after laboratory adaptation (log 10 reduction factors increased by 0.54 and 0.91 for resistant and multiresistant strains, respectively) 704. Other studies have found naturally occurring cells of P. aeurginosa were more resistant to a variety of disinfectants than were subcultured cells 705. Uses. OPA has several potential advantages over glutaraldehyde. It has excellent stability over a wide pH range (pH 3 -9), is not a known irritant to the eyes and nasal passages 706, does not require exposure monitoring, has a barely perceptible odor, and requires no activation. OPA, like glutaraldehyde, has excellent material compatibility. A potential disadvantage of OPA is that it stains proteins gray (including unprotected skin) and thus must be handled with caution 69. However, sk in staining would indicate improper handling that requires additional training and/or personal protective equipment (e.g., gloves, eye and mouth protection, and fluid- resistant gowns). OPA residues remaining on inadequately water -rinsed transesophageal echo probes can stain the patient's mouth 707. Meticulous cleaning, using the correct OPA exposure time (e.g., 12 minutes) and copious rinsing of the prob e with water should eliminate this problem. The results of one study provided a basis for a recommendation that rinsing of instruments disinfected with OPA will require at least 250 mL of water per channel to reduce the chemical residue to a level that wil l not compromise patient or staff safety (<1 ppm) 708. Personal protectiv e equipment should be worn when contaminated instruments, equipment, and chemicals are handled 400. In addition, equipment must be thoroughly rinsed to prev ent discoloration of a patient's skin or mucous membrane. In April 2004, the manufacturer of OPA disseminated information to users about patients who reportedly experienced an anaphylaxis -like reaction after cystoscopy where the scope had been reprocessed using OPA. Of approximately 1 million urologic procedures performed using instruments reprocessed using OPA, 24 cases (17 cases in the United States, six in Japan, one in the United Kingdom) of anaphylaxis -like reactions have been reported after repeated cystoscopy (typically after four to nine treatments). Preventive measures include removal of OPA residues by thorough rinsing and not using OPA for reprocessing urologic instrumentation used to treat patients with a history of bladder cancer (Nevine Erian, personal communication, June 4, 2004; Product Notification, Advanced Sterilization Products, April 23, 2004) 709. A few OPA clinical studies are available. In a clinical -use study, OPA exposure of 100 endoscopes for 5 minutes resulted in a >5- log10 reduction in bacterial load. Furthermore, OPA was effect ive over a 14-day use cycle 100. Manufacturer data show that OPA will last longer in an automatic endoscope reprocessor before reaching its MEC limit (MEC after 82 cycles) than will glutaraldehyde (MEC after 40 cycles) 400. High-pressure liquid chromatography confirmed that OPA levels are maintained above 0.3% for at least 50 cycles 706, 710. OPA must be d isposed in accordance with local and state regulations. If OPA disposal through the sanitary sewer system is restricted, glycine (25 grams/gallon) can be used to neutralize the OPA and make it safe for disposal. The high- level disinfectant label claims f or OPA solution at 20\u00baC vary worldwide (e.g., 5 minutes in Europe, Asia, and Latin America; 10 minutes in Canada and Australia; and 12 minutes in the United States). These label claims differ worldwide because of differences in the test methodology and requirements for licensure. In an automated endoscope reprocessor with an FDA -cleared capability to maintain solution temperatures at 25 \u00b0C, the contact time for OPA is 5 minutes . Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 51 of 163 Peracetic Acid Overview. Peracetic, or peroxyacetic, acid is characterized by rapid action against all microorganisms. Special advantages of peracetic acid are that it lacks harmful decomposition products (i.e., acetic acid, water, oxygen, hydrogen peroxide), enhances removal of organic material 711, and leaves no residue. It remains effective in the presence of organic matter and is sporicidal even at low temperatures (Tables 4 and 5). Peracetic acid can corrode copper, brass, bronze, plain steel, and galvanized iron but these effects can be reduced by additives and pH modifications. It is considered unstable, particularly when diluted; for example, a 1% solution loses half its strength through hydrolysis in 6 days, whereas 40% peracetic acid loses 1% -2% of its active ingredients per month 654. Mode of Action. Little is known about the mechanism of action of peracetic acid, but it is believed to function similarly to other oxidizing agents \u2014that is, it denatures proteins, disrupts the cell wall permeability, and oxidizes sulfhydryl and sulfur bonds in proteins, e nzymes, and other metabolites 654. Microbicidal Activity. Peracetic acid will inactivate gram -positive and gram -negative bacteria, fungi, and yeasts in 5 minutes at <100 ppm. In the presence of organic matter, 200- 500 ppm is required. For viruses, the dosage range is wide (12- 2250 ppm), with poliovirus inactivated in yeast extract in 15 with 1,500- 2,250 ppm. In one study, 3.5% peracetic acid was ineffective against HAV after 1- minute exposure using a carrier test 58. Peracetic acid (0.26%) was effective (log 10 reduction factor >5) against all test strains of mycobacteria ( M. tuberculosis, M. avium- intracellulare, M. chelonae, and M. fortuitum) within 20 -30 minutes in the presence or absence of an organic load 607, 712. With bacterial spores, 500 -10,000 ppm (0.05% -1%) inactivates spores in 15 seconds to 30 minutes using a spore suspension test 654, 659, 713-715. Uses. An automated machine using peracetic acid to chemically sterilize medical (e.g., endoscopes, arthroscopes), surgical, and dental instruments is used in the United States716-718. As previously noted, dental handpieces should be steam sterilized. The sterilant, 35% peracetic acid, is diluted to 0.2% with filtered water at 50\u00baC. Simulated- use trials have demonstrated excellent microbicidal activity 111, 718 -722, and three clinical trials have demonstrated both excellent microbial killing and no clinical failures leading to infection90, 723, 724. The high efficacy of the system was demonstrated in a comparison of the efficacies of the system with that of ethylene oxide. Only the peracetic acid system completely killed 6 log 10 of M. chelonae, E. faecalis, and B. atrophaeus spores with both an organic and inorganic challenge722. An investigation that compared the costs, performance, and maintenance of urologic endoscopic equipment processed by high- level disinfection (with glutaraldehyde) with those of the peracetic acid system reported no clinical differences between the two systems. However, the use of this system led to higher costs than the high- level disinfection, including costs for processing ($6.11 vs. $0.45 per cycle), purchasing and training ($24,845 vs. $16), installation ($5,800 vs. vs. $445) 90. Furthe rmore, three clusters of infection using the peracetic acid automated endoscope reprocessor were linked to inadequately processed bronchoscopes when inappropriate channel connectors were used with the system 725. These clusters highlight the importance of training, proper model -specific endoscope connector systems, and quality -control procedures to ensure compliance with endoscope manufacturer recommendations and professional organization guidelines. An alternative high- level disinfectant available in the United Kingdom contains 0.35% peracetic acid. Although this product is rapid ly effective against a broad range of microorganisms 466, 726, 727, it tarnishes the metal of endoscopes and is unstable, resul ting in only a 24- hour use life 727. Peracetic Acid and Hydrogen Peroxide Overview. Two chemical sterilants are available that contain peracetic acid plus hydrogen peroxide (i.e., 0.08% peracetic acid plus 1.0% hydrogen peroxide [no longer marketed] ; and 0.23% peracetic acid plus 7.35% hydrogen peroxide (Tables 4 and 5). Microbicidal Activity. The bactericidal properties of peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide have been demons trated 728. Manufacturer data demonstrated this combination of peracetic acid and hydrogen Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 52 of 163 peroxide inactivated all microorganisms except bacterial spores within 20 minutes. The 0.08% peracetic acid plus 1.0% hydrogen peroxide product effectively inactivated glutaraldehyde- resistant mycobacteria729. Uses. The combination of peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide has been used for disinfecting hemodialyzers 730. The percentage of dialysis centers using a peracetic acid- hydrogen peroxide- based disinfectant for r eprocessing dialyzers from 5% in 1983 to 56% in 1997249. Olympus America does not endorse use of 0.08% peracetic acid plus 1.0% hydrogen peroxide (Olympus America, personal communication, April 15, 1998) on any Olympus endoscope because of cosmetic and functional damage and will not assume liability for chemical damage resulting from use of this product. This product is not currently available. FDA has cleared a newer chemical sterilant with 0.23% peracetic acid and 7.35% hydrogen peroxide (Tables 4 and 5). After testing the 7.35% hydrogen peroxide and 0.23% peracetic acid product, Olympus America concluded it was not compatible with the company's flexible gastrointestinal endoscopes; this conclusion was based on immersi on studies where the test insertion tubes had failed because of swelling and loosening of the black polymer layer of the tube (Olympus America, personal communication, September 13, 2000). Phenolics Overview. Phenol has occupied a prominent place in the field of hospital disinfection since its initial use as a germicide by Lister in his pioneering work on antiseptic surgery. In the past 30 years, however, work has concentrated on the numerous phenol derivatives or phenolics and their antimicrobial properties. Phenol derivatives originate when a functional group (e.g., alkyl, phenyl, benzyl, halogen) replaces one of the hydrogen atoms on the aromatic ring. Two phenol derivatives commonly found as constituents of hospital disinfectants are ortho- phenylphenol and ortho- benzyl -para- chlorophenol. The antimicrobial properties of these compounds and many other phenol derivatives are much improved over those of the parent chemical. Phenolics are absorbed by porous materials, and the residual disinfectant can irri tate tissue. In 1970, depigmentation of the skin was reported to be caused by phenolic germicidal detergents containing para- tertiary butylphenol and para- tertiary amylphenol 731. Mode of Action. In high concentrations, phenol acts as a gross protoplasmic poison, penetrating and disrupting the cell wall and precipitating the cell proteins. Low concentrations of phenol and higher molecular -weight phenol derivatives cause bacterial death by inactivation of essential enzyme systems and leakage of essential metabolites from the cell wal l 732. Microbicidal Activity. Published reports on the antimicrobial efficacy of commonly used phenolics showed they were bactericidal, fungicidal, virucidal, and tuberculocidal 14, 61, 71, 73, 227, 416, 573, 732 -738. One study demonstrated little or no virucidal effect of a phenolic against coxsackie phenylphenol failed to inactivate any of the three hydrophilic viruses after a 10- minute exposure time, although 5% phenol was lethal for these viruses 72. A para- tertiary -amylphenol) all but one of 11 fungi tested 71. Manufacturers' data using the standardized AOAC methods demonstrate that commercial phenolics are not sporicidal but are tuberculocidal, fungicidal, virucidal, and bactericidal at their recommended use- dilution. Attempts to substantiate the bactericidal label claims of phenolics using the AOAC Use- Dilution Method occasionally have failed 416, 737. However, results from these same studies have varied dramatically among laboratories testing identical products . Uses. Many phenolic germicides are EPA -registered as disinfectants for use on environmental surfaces (e.g., bedside tables, bedrails, and laboratory surfaces) and noncritical medical devices. Phenolics are not FDA -cleared as high- level disinfectants for use with semicritical items but could be used to preclean Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 53 of 163 or decontaminate critical and semicritical devices before terminal sterilization or high- level disinfection . The use of phenolics in nurseries has been questioned because of hyperbilirubinemia in infants placed in bassinets where phenolic detergents were used 739. In addition, bilirubin levels were reported to increase in phenolic -exposed infants, compared with nonphenolic -exposed infants, when the phenolic was prepared according to the manufacturers' recommended dilution 740. If phenolics are used to clean nursery floors, they must be diluted as recommended on the product label. Phenolics (and other disinfectants) should not be used to clean infant bassinets and incubators while occupied. If phenolics are used to terminally clean infant bassinets and incubators, the surfaces should be rinsed thoroughly with water and dried before reuse of infant bassinets and incubators 17. Quaternary Ammonium Compounds Overview. The quaternary ammonium compounds are widely used as disinfectants. Health- care- associated infections have been reported from contaminated quaternary ammonium compounds used to disinfect patient -care supplies or equipment, such as cystoscopes or cardiac catheters 741, 742. The quaternaries are good cleaning agents , but high w ater hardness 743 and materials such as cotton and gauze pads can make them less microbicidal because of insoluble precipitates or cotton and gauze pads absorb the active ingredients, respectively. One study showed a significant decline (~40% -50% lower at 1 hour) in the concentration of quaternaries released when cotton rags or cellulose -based wipers were used in the open- bucket system, compared with the nonwoven spunlace wipers in the closed- bucket system 744 As with several other disinfectants (e.g., phenolics, iodophors) gram -negative bacteria can survive or grow in them 404. Chemically, the quaternaries are organically substituted ammonium compounds in which the nitrogen atom has a valence of 5, four of the substituent radicals (R1- R4) are alkyl or heterocyclic radicals of a given size or chain length, and the fifth (X-) is a hali de, sulfate, or similar radical 745. Each compound exhibits its own antimicrobial characteristics, hence the search for one compound with outstanding antimicrobial properti es. Some of the chemical names of quaternary ammonium compounds used in healthcare are The newer quaternary ammonium compounds (i.e., fourth generation), referred to as twin- chain or dialkyl quaternaries dioctyl dimethyl ammonium bromide), purportedly remain active in hard water and are tolerant of anionic residues 746. A few case reports have documented occupational asthma as a result of exposure to benzalkonium chloride 747. Mode of Action. The bactericidal action of the quaternaries has been attributed to the inactivation of energy -producing enzymes, denaturation of essential cell proteins, and disruption of the cell membrane746. Evidence exists that supports these and other possibilities 745 748. Microbicidal Activity. Results from manufacturers' data sheets and from published scientific literature indicate that the quaternaries sold as hospital disinfectants are generally fungicidal, bactericidal, and virucidal against lipophilic (enveloped) v iruses; they are not sporicidal and generally not tuberculocidal or virucidal against hydrophilic (nonenveloped) viruses14, 54- 56, 58, 59, 61, 71, 73, 186, 297, 748, 749. The poor mycobactericidal activities of quaternary ammonium compounds have been demonstrated 55, 73. Quaternary ammonium compounds (as well as 70% isopropyl alcohol, phenolic, and a chlorine- containing wipe effectively (>95%) remove and/or inactivate vancomycin- resistant Entercoccus , P. aeruginosa ) from computer keyboards with a 5- second application time. No functional damage or cosmetic changes occurred to the computer keyboards after 300 applications of the disinfectants 45. Attempts to reproduce the manufacturers' bactericidal and tuberculocidal claims using the AOAC tests Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 54 of 163 with a limited number of quaternary ammonium compounds occasionally have failed 73, 416, 737. However, test results have varied extensively among laboratories testing identical products 416, 737. Uses. The quaternaries commonly are used in ordinary environmental sanitation of noncritical surfaces, such as floors, furniture, and walls. EPA -registered quaternary ammonium compounds are appropriate to use for disinfecting medical equipment that contacts intact skin (e.g., blood pressure cuffs). Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 55 of 163 Miscellaneous Inactivating Agents Other Germicides Several compounds have antimicrobial activity but for various reasons have not been incorporated into the armamentarium of health- care disinfectants. These propylene), and the Tego disinfectants. Two authoritative references examine these agents in detail 16, 412. A peroxygen- containing formulation had marked bacteric idal action when used as a 1% weight/volume solution and virucidal activity at 3% 49, but did not have mycobactericidal activity at concentrations of 2.3% and 4% and exposure times ranging from 30 to 120 minutes 750. It also required 20 hours to kill B. atrophaeus spores 751. A powder -based peroxygen compound for disinfecting contaminated spill was st rongly and rapidly bactericidal 752. In preliminary studies, nanoemulsions (composed of detergents and lipids in water) showed activity against vegetative bacteria, enveloped viruses and Candida. This product represents a potential agent for use as a topical biocidal agent . 753-755. New disinfectants that require further evaluation include glucoprotamin756, tertiary amines 703. and a light-activated antimicrobial coating 757. Several other disinfection technologies might have potential applications in the healthcare setting 758. Metals as Microbicides Comprehensive reviews of antisepsis 759, disinfection421, and anti -infective chemotherapy 760 barely mention the antimicrobial activity of heavy metals761, 762. Nevertheless, the anti -infective activity of some heavy metals has been known since antiquity. Heavy metals such as silver have been used for prophylaxis of conjunctivitis of the newborn, topical therapy for burn wounds, and bonding to indwelling catheters, and the use of heavy metals as antiseptics or disinfectants is again being explored 763. Inactivation of bacteria on stainless steel surfaces by zeolite ceramic coatings containing silver and zinc ions has also been demonstrated 764, 765. Metals such as silver, iron, and copper could be used for environmental control, disinfection of water, or reusable medical devices or incorporated into medical devices (e.g., intravascular catheters) 400, 761 -763, 766-770. A comparative evaluation of six disinfectant formulations for residual antimicrobial activity demonstrated that only the silver disinfectant demonstrated significant residual activity against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa 763. Preliminary data suggest metals are effective against a wide variety of microorganisms. Clinical uses of other heavy metals include copper -8-quinolinolate as a fungicide against Aspergillus preservative/disinfectant (e.g., thimerosal [currently being removed from vaccines]) in pharmaceuticals and cosmetics 762. Ultraviolet Radiation (UV) The wavelength of UV radiation ranges from 328 nm to 210 nm (3280 A to 2100 A). Its maximum bactericidal effect occurs at 240 -280 nm. Mercury vapor lamps emit more than 90% of their radiation at 253.7 nm, which is near the maximum microbicidal activity 775. Inactivation of microorganisms res ults from destruction of nucleic acid through induction of thymine dimers. UV radiation has been employed in the disinfection of drinking water 776, air 775, titanium implants 777, and contact lenses778. Bacteria and viruses are more easily killed by UV light than are bacterial spores 775. UV radiation has several potent ial applications, but unfortunately its germicidal effectiveness and use is influenced by organic matter; wavelength; type of suspension; temperature; type of microorganism; and UV intensity, which is affected Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 56 of 163 by distance and dirty tubes779. The application of UV radiation in the health- care environment (i.e., operating rooms, isolation rooms, and biologic safety cabinets) is limited to destruction of airborne organisms or inactivation of microorganisms on surfaces. The effect of UV radiation on postoperative wound infections was investigated in a double- blind, randomized study in five university medical centers. After following 14,854 patients over a 2- year period, the investigators reported the overall wound infection rate was unaffected by UV radiation, although postoperative infection in the \"refined clean\" surgical procedures decreased signifi cantly (3.8% -2.9%) 780. No data support the use of UV lamps in isolation rooms, and this practice has caused at least one epidemic of UV -induced skin erythema and keratoconjunctivitis in hospital patients and visitors 781. Pasteurization Pasteurization is not a sterilization process; its purpose is to destroy all pathogenic microorganisms. However, pasteurization does not destroy bacterial spores. The time- temperature relation for hot -water pasteurization is generally ~ 70\u00b0C (158\u00b0F ) for 30 minutes. The water temperature and time should be monitored as part of a quality -assurance program 782. Pasteurization of respiratory therapy 783, 784 and anesthesia equipment 785 is a recognized alternativ e to chemical disinfection. The efficacy of this process has been tested using an inoculum that the authors believed might simulate contamination by an infected patient. Use of a large inoculum (107) of P. aeruginosa or Acinetobacter calcoaceticus in sets of respiratory tubing before processing demonstrated that machine- assisted chemical processing was more efficient than machine- assisted pasteurization with a disinfection failure rate of 6% and 83%, respectively 783. Other investigators found hot water disinfection to be effective (inactivation factor >5 log 10) against multiple bacteria, including multidrug- resistant bacteria, for disinfecting reusable anesthesia or respiratory therapy 784-786. Flushing- and Washer -Disinfectors Flushing- and washer -disinfectors are automated and closed equipment that clean and disinfect objects from bedpans and washbowls to surgical instruments and anesthesia tubes. Items such as bedpans and urinals can be cleaned and disinfected in flushing- disinfectors. They have a short cycle of a few minutes. They clean by flushing with warm water, possibly with a detergent, and then disinfect by flushing the items with hot water or with steam. Because this machine empties, cleans, and disinfects, manual cleaning is eliminated, fewer disposable items are needed, and fewer chemical germicides are used. A microbiologic evaluation of one washer/disinfector demonstrated complete inactivation of suspensions of E. faecalis or poliovirus 787. Other studies have shown that strains of Enterococcus faecium can survive the British Standard for heat disinfection of bedpans (80\u00baC for 1 minute). The significance of this finding with reference to the potential for enterococci to survive and disseminate in the health- care environment is debatable 788-790. These machines are available and used in many European countries. Surgical instruments and anesthesia equipment are more difficult to clean. They are run in washer - disinfectors on a longer cycle of approximately 20 -30 minutes with a detergent. These machines also disinfect by hot water at approximately 90\u00b0 C 791. Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 57 of 163 The Regulatory Framework for Disinfectants and Sterilants Before using the guidance provided in this document, health- care workers should be aware of the federal laws and regulations that govern the sale, distribution, and use of di sinfectants and sterilants. In particular, health- care workers need to know what requirements pertain to them when they apply these products. Finally, they should understand the relative roles of EPA, FDA, and CDC so the context for the guidance provided i n this document is clear. EPA and FDA In the United States, chemical germicides formulated as sanitizers, disinfectants, or sterilants are regulated in interstate commerce by the Antimicrobials Division, Office of Pesticides Program, EPA, under the authority of the Federal Insecticide, Fungici de, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) of 1947, as amended 792. Under FIFRA, any substance or mixture of substances intended to prevent, destroy, repel, or mitigate any pest (including microorganisms but excluding those in or on living humans or animals) must be registered before sale or distribution. To obtain a registration, a manufacturer must submit specific data about the safety and effectiveness of each product. For example, EPA requires manufacturers of sanitizers, disinfectants, or chemical sterilants to test formulations by using accepted methods for microbiocidal activity, stability, and toxicity to animals and humans. The manufacturers submit these data to EPA along with proposed labeling. If EPA conc ludes the product can be used without causing \"unreasonable adverse effects,\" then the product and its labeling are registered, and the manufacturer can sell and distribute the product in the United States. FIFRA also requires users of products to follow explicitly the labeling directions on each product. The following standard statement appears on all labels under the \"Directions for Use\" heading: \"It is a violation of federal law to use this product in a manner inconsistent with its labeling.\" This stat ement means a health- care worker must follow the safety precautions and use directions on the labeling of each registered product. Failure to follow the specified use- dilution, contact time, method of application, or any other condition of use is considere d a misuse of the product and potentially subject to enforcement action under FIFRA. In general, EPA regulates disinfectants and sterilants used on environmental surfaces, and not those used on critical or semicritical medical devices; the latter are reg ulated by FDA. In June 1993, FDA and EPA issued a \"Memorandum of Understanding\" that divided responsibility for review and surveillance of chemical germicides between the two agencies. Under the agreement, FDA regulates liquid chemical sterilants used on c ritical and semicritical devices, and EPA regulates disinfectants used on noncritical surfaces and gaseous sterilants 793. In 1996, Congress passed the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA). This act amended FIFRA in regard t o several types of products regulated by both EPA and FDA. One provision of FQPA removed regulation of liquid chemical sterilants used on critical and semicritical medical devices from EPA's jurisdiction, and it now rests solely with FDA 792, 794. EPA continues to register nonmedical chemical sterilants. FDA and EPA have considered the impact of FQPA, and in January 2000, FDA published its final guidance document on product submissions and labeling. Antiseptics are considered antimicrobial drugs used on living tissue and thus are regulated by FDA under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. FDA regulates liquid chemical sterilants and high- level disinfectants intended to process critical and semicritical devices. FDA has published recommendations on the types of test methods that manufacturers should submit to FDA for 510[k] clearance for such agents. CDC At CDC, the mission of the Coordinating Center for Infections Diseases is to guide the public on how to prevent and respond to infectious diseases in both health- care settings and at home. With respect to disinfectants and sterilants, part of CDC's role is to inform the public (in this case healthcare personnel) of current scientific evidence pertaining to these products, to comment about their safety and ef ficacy, and to recommend which chemicals might be most appropriate or effective for specific microorganisms and settings. Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 58 of 163 Test Methods The methods EPA has used for registration are standardized by the AOAC International; however, a survey of scientific literature reveals a number of problems with these tests that were reported during 1987 -1990 58, 76, 80, 428, 736, 737, 795 -800 that cause them to be neither accurate nor reproducible 416, 737. As part of their regulatory authority, EPA and FDA support development and validation of methods for assessing disinfection claims 801-803. For example, EPA has supported the work of Dr. Syed Sattar and coworkers who have developed a two- tier quantitative carrier test to assess sporicidal, mycobactericidal, bactericidal, fungicidal, virucidal, and protozoacidal activity of chemical germicides 701, 803. EPA is accepting label claims against hepatitis B virus (HBV) using a surrogate organism, the duck HBV , to quantify disinfectant activity 124, 804. EPA also is accepting labeling claims against hepatitis C virus using the bovine viral diarrhea virus as a surrogate. For nearly 30 years, EPA also performed intramural preregistration and postregistration efficacy testing of some chemical disinfectants in its own laboratories. In 1982, this was stopped, reportedly for budgetary reasons. At that time, manufacturers did not need to have microbiologic activity claims verified by EPA or an independent testing laboratory when registering a disinfectant or chemical sterilant 805. This occurred when the frequency of contaminated germicides and infections secondary to their use had increased 404. Investigations demonstrating that interlaboratory reproducibility of test results was poor and manufacturers' label claims were not verifiable 416, 737 and symposia sponsored by the American Society for Microbiology 800 heightened awareness of these problems and reconfirmed the need to improve the AOAC methods and reinstate a microbiologic activity verification program. A General Accounting Office report entitled Disinfectants: EPA Lacks Assurance They Work 806 seemed to provide the necessary impetus for EPA to initiate corrective measures, including cooperative agreements to improve the AOAC methods and independent verification testing for all products labeled as sporicidal and disinfectants label ed as tuberculocidal. For example, of 26 sterilant products tested by EPA, 15 were canceled because of product failure. A list of products registered with EPA and labeled for use as sterilants or tuberculocides or against HIV and/or HBV is available throug h EPA's website at [This link is no longer active: http://www.epa.gov/oppad001/chemregindex.htm . The current version of this document may differ from original version: Selected EPA -registered Disinfectants (https://www.epa.gov/pesti cide- registration/selected- epa-registered- disinfectants ).]. Organizations (e.g., Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) are working to standardize requirements for germicide testing and registration. Neutralization of Germicides One of t he difficulties associated with evaluating the bactericidal activity of disinfectants is prevention of bacteriostasis from disinfectant residues carried over into the subculture media. Likewise, small amounts of di sinfectants on environmental surfaces can make an accurate bacterial count difficult to get when sampling of the health- care environment as part of an epidemiologic or research investigation. One way these problems may be overcome is by employing neutraliz ers that inactivate residual disinfectants 807-809. Two commonly used neutralizing media for chemical disinfectants are Letheen Media and D/E Neutralizing Media. The former contains lecithin to neutralize quaternaries and polysorbate 80 (Tween 80) to neutralize phenolics, hexachlorophene, formalin, and, with lecithin, ethanol. The D/E Neutralizing media will neutralize a broad spectrum of antiseptic and disinfectant chemicals, including quaternary ammonium compounds, phenols, iodine and chlorine compounds, mercurials, formaldehyd e, and glutaraldehyde 810. A review of neutralizers used in germicide testing has been published808. Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 59 of 163 Sterilization Most medical and surgical devices used in healthcare facilities are made of materials that are heat stable and therefore undergo heat, primarily steam , sterilization. However, since 1950, there has been an increase in medical devices and instruments made of materials (e.g., plastics) that require low - temperature sterilization. Ethylene oxide gas has been used since the 1950s for heat - and moisture- sensitive medical devices. Within the past 15 years, a number of new, low -temperature sterili zation systems (e.g., hydrogen peroxide gas plasma, peracetic acid immersion, ozone ) have been developed and are being used to sterilize medical devices. This section reviews sterilization technologies used in healthcare and makes recommendations for their optimum performance in the processing of medical devices 1, 18, 811-820. Sterilization destroys all microorganisms on the surface of an article or in a fluid to prevent disease transmission associated with the use of that item. While the use of inadequately sterilized critical items represents a high risk of transmitting pathogens, documented transmission of pathogens associated with an inadequately sterilized critical item is exceedingly rare 821, 822. This is likely due to the wide margin of safety associated with the sterilization processes used in healthcare facilities. The concept of what constitutes \"sterile\" is measured as a probability of sterility for each item to be sterilized. This probability is commonly referred to as the sterility assurance level (SAL) of the product and is defined as the probability of a single viable microorganism occurring on a product after sterilization. SAL is normally expressed a 10-n. For example, if the probability of a spore surviving were one in one million, the SAL woul d be 10-6 823, 824. In short, a SAL is an estimate of lethality of the entire sterilization process and is a conservative calculation. Dual SALs (e.g., 10-3 SAL for blood culture tubes, drainage bags; 10-6 SAL for scalpels, implants) have been used in the United States for many years and the choice of a 10-6 SAL was strictly arbitrary and not as sociated with any adverse outcomes (e.g., patient infections) 823. Medical devices that have contact with sterile body tissues or fluids are considered critical items. These items should be sterile when used because any microbial contamination could result in disease transmission. Such items include surgical instruments, biopsy forceps, and implanted medical devices. If these items are heat resistant, the recommended sterilization process is steam sterilization, because it has the largest margin of safety due to its re liability, consistency, and lethality. However, reprocessing heat- and moisture- sensitive items requires use of a low -temperature sterilization technology (e.g., ethylene oxide, hydrogen peroxide gas plasm a, peracetic acid) 825. A summary of the advantages and disadvantages for commonly used sterilization technologies is presented in Table 6. Steam Sterilization Overview. Of all the methods available for sterilization, moist heat in the form of saturated steam under pressure is the most widely used and the most dependable. Steam sterili zation is nontoxic, inexpensive 826, rapidly microbicidal, sporicidal, and rapidly heats and penetrates fabrics (Table 6 ) 827. Like all sterilization processes, steam sterilization has some deleterious effects on some materials, including corrosion and combustion of lubricants associated with dental handpieces212; reduction in ability to transmit light associated with laryngoscopes828; and increased hardening ti me (5.6 fold) with plaster - cast 829. The basic principle of steam sterilization, as accomplished in an autoclave, is to expose each item to direct steam contact at the required temperature and pressure for the specified time. Thus, there are four parameters of steam sterilization: steam, pressure, temperature, and time. The ideal steam for sterilization is dry saturated steam and entrained water (dryness fraction 97%)813, 819. Pressure serves as a means to obtain the high temperatures necessary to quickly kill microorganisms. Specific temperatures must be obtained to ensure the microbicidal activity. The two common steam -sterilizing temperatures are 121\u00b0C (250\u00b0F ) and 132\u00b0C (270\u00b0F ). These temperatures (and other high temperatures) 830 must be maintained for a minimal time to kill microorganisms. Recognized minimum exposure periods for sterilization of wrapped healthcare supplies are 30 minutes at 121 \u00b0C (250\u00b0F ) in a gravity displacement Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 60 of 163 sterilizer or 4 minutes at 132\u00b0C (270\u00b0C ) in a prevacuum sterilizer (Table 7). At constant temperatures, sterilization times vary depending on the type of item (e.g., metal versus rubber, p lastic, items with lumens), whether the item is wrapped or unwrapped, and the sterilizer type. The two basic types of steam sterilizers (autoclaves) are the gravity displacement autoclave and the high-speed prevacuum sterilizer. In the former, steam is admitted at the top or the sides of the sterilizing chamber and, because the steam is lighter than air, forces air out the bottom of the chamber through the drain vent. The gravity displacement autoclaves are primarily used to process laboratory media, water, pharmaceutical products, regulated medical waste, and nonporous articles whose surfaces have direct steam contact. For gravity displacement sterilizers the penetration time into porous items is prolonged because of incomplete air elimination. This point is illustrated with the decontamination of 10 lbs of microbiological waste, which requires at least 45 minutes at 121\u00b0C because the entrapped air remaining in a load of waste greatly retards steam permeation and heating efficiency831, 832. The high- speed prevacuum sterilizers are similar to the gravity displacement sterilizers except they are fitted with a vacuum pump (or ejector) to ensure air removal from the sterilizing chamber and load before the steam is admitted. The advantage of using a vacuum pump is that there is nearly instantaneous steam penetration even i nto porous loads. The Bowie- Dick test is used to detect air leaks and inadequate air removal and consists of folded 100% cotton surgical towels that are clean and preconditioned. A commercially available Bowie -Dick-type test sheet should be placed in the c enter of the pack. The test pack should be placed horizontally in the front, bottom section of the sterilizer rack, near the door and over the drain, in an otherwise empty chamber and run at 134\u00b0C for 3.5 minutes813, 819. The test is used each day the vacuum -type steam sterilizer is used, before the first processed load. Air that is not removed from the chamber will interfere with steam contact. Smaller disposable test packs (or process challenge devices) have been devised to replace the stack of folded surgical towels for testing the efficacy of the vacuum system in a prevacuum sterilizer. 833 These devices are \"designed to simulate product to be sterilized and to constitute a defined challenge to the sterilization process\"819, 834. They should be representative of the load and sim ulate the greatest challenge to the load835. Sterilizer vacuum performance is acceptable if the sheet inside the test pack shows a uniform color change. Entrapped air will cause a spot to appear on the test sheet, due to the inability of the steam to reach the chemical indicator. If the sterilizer fails the Bowie- Dick test, do not use the sterilizer until it is inspected by the sterilizer maintenance personnel and passes the Bowie- Dick test813, 819, 836. Another design in steam sterilization is a steam flush- pressure pulsing process, which removes air rapidly by repeatedly alternating a steam flush and a pressure pulse above atmospheric pres sure. Air is rapidly removed from the load as with the prevacuum sterilizer, but air leaks do not affect this process because the steam in the sterilizing chamber is always above atmospheric pressure. Typical sterilization temperatures and times are 132 \u00b0C to 135 \u00b0C with 3 to 4 minutes exposure time for porous loads and instruments827, 837. Like other sterilization systems, the steam cycle is monitored by mechanical, chemical, and biological monitors. Steam sterilizers usually are monitored using a printout (or graphically) by measuring temperature, the time at the temperature, and pressure. Typically, chemical indicators are affixed to the outside and incorporated into the pack to monitor the temperature or time and temperature. The effectiveness of steam sterilization is monitored with a biological indicator containing spores of Geobacillus stearotherm ophilus (formerly Bacillus stearothermophilus ). Positive spore test results are a relatively rare event 838 and can be attributed to operator error, inadequate steam delivery839, or equipment malfunction. Portable (table -top) steam sterilizers are used in outpatient, dental, and rural clinics840. These sterilizers are designed for small instruments, such as hypodermic syringes and needles and dental instruments. The ability of the sterilizer to reach physical parameters necessary to achieve sterilization should be monitored by mechanical, chemical, and biological indicators. Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 61 of 163 Microbicidal Activity. The oldest and most recognized agent for inactivation of microorganisms is heat. D-values (time to reduce the surviving population by 90% or 1 log 10) allow a direct comparison of the heat resistance of microorganisms. Because a D -value can be determined at various temperatures, a subscript is used to designate t he exposure temperature (i.e., D 121C). D121C-values for Geobacillus stearothermophilus used to monitor the steam sterilization process range from 1 to 2 minutes. Heat - resistant nonspore- forming bacteria, yeasts, and fungi have such low D 121C values that they cannot be experimentally measured841. Mode of Action. Moist heat destroys microorganisms by the irreversible coagulation and denaturation of enzymes and structural proteins. In support of this fact, it has been found that the presence of moisture significantly affects the coagulation temperature of proteins and the temperature at which microorganisms are destroyed. Uses. Steam sterilization should be used whenever possible on all critical and semicritical items that are heat and moisture resistant (e.g., steam sterilizable respiratory therapy and anesthesia equipment), even when not essential to prevent pathogen transmission. Steam sterilizers also are used in healthcare facilities to decontaminate microbiological waste and sharps containers 831, 832, 842 but additional exposure time is required in the gravity displacement sterilizer for these items. Flash Sterilization Overview. \"Flash\" steam sterilization was originally defined by Underwood and Perkins as sterilization of an unwrapped object at 132\u00b0C for 3 minutes at 27- 28 lbs. of pressure in a gravity displacement sterilizer843. Currently, the time required for flash sterilization depends on the type of sterilizer and the type of item (i.e., porous vs non- porous items)(see Table 8 ). Although the wrapped method of sterilization is preferred for the reasons listed below, correctly performed flash sterilization is an effective process for the sterilization of critical medical devices844, 845. Flash sterilization is a modification of conventi onal steam sterilization (either gravity , prevacuum , or steam -flush pressure- pulse) in which the flashed item is placed in an open tray or is placed in a specially designed, covered, rigid container to allow for rapid penetration of steam. Historically, it is not recommended as a routine sterilization method because of the lack of timely biological indicators to monitor performance, absence of protective packaging following sterilization, possibility for contamination of processed items during transportation to the operating rooms, and the sterilization cycle parameters (i.e., time, temperature, pressure) are minimal. To address some of these concerns, many healthcare facilities have done the following: placed equipment for flash sterilization in close proxi mity to operating rooms to facilitate aseptic delivery to the point of use (usually the sterile field in an ongoing surgical procedure); extended the exposure time to ensure lethality comparable to sterilized wrapped items (e.g., 4 minutes at 132 \u00b0C)846, 847; used biological indicators that provide results in 1 hour for flash- sterilized items846, 847; and used protective packaging that permits steam penetration812, 817 -819, 845, 848. Further, some rigid, reusable sterilization container systems have been designed and validated by the container manufacturer for use with flash cycles. When sterile items are open to air, they will eventually become contaminated. Thus, the longer a sterile item is exposed to air, the greater the number of microorganisms that will settle on it. Sterilization cycle parameters for flash sterilization are shown in Table 8. A few adverse events have been associated with flash sterilization. When evaluating an increased incidence of neurosurgical infections, the investigators noted that surgical instruments were flash sterilized between cases and 2 of 3 craniotomy infections involved plate implants that were flash sterili zed849. A report of two patients who r eceived burns during surgery from instruments that had been flash sterilized reinforced the need to develop policies and educate staff to prevent the use of instruments hot enough to cause c linical burns850. Staff should use precautions to prevent burns with potentially hot instruments (e.g., transport tray using heat -protective gloves). Patient burns may be prevented by either air-cooling the instruments or immersion in sterile liquid (e.g., saline). Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 62 of 163 Uses. Flash sterilization is considered acceptable for processing cleaned patient -care items that cannot be packaged, sterilized, and stored before use. It also is used when there is insufficient time to sterilize an item by the preferred package method. Flash sterilization should not be used for reasons of convenience, as an alternative to purchasing additional instrument sets, or to save time817. Because of the potential for serious infections, flash sterilization is not recommended for implantable devices (i.e., devices placed into a surgically or naturally formed cavity of the human body); however, flash sterilization may be unavoidable for some devices (e.g., orthopedic screw, plates). If flash sterilization of an implantable device is unavoidable, recordkeeping ( i.e., load identification, patient's name/hospital identifier, and biological indicator result) is essential for epidemiological tracking (e.g., of surgical site infection, tracing results of biological indi cators to patients who received the item to document sterility), and for an assessment of the reliability of the sterilization process (e.g., evaluation of biological monitoring records and sterilization maintenance records noting preventive maintenance and repairs with dates). Low-Temperature Sterilization Technologies Ethylene oxide (ETO) has been widely used as a low -temperature sterilant since the 1950s. It has been the most commonly used process for sterilizing temperature- and moisture- sensitive medical devices and supplies in healthcare institutions in the United States. Two types of ETO sterilizers are available, mixed gas and 100% ETO. Until 1995, ethylene oxide sterilizers combined ETO with a chloroflourocarbon (CFC) stabilizing agent, most comm only in a ratio of 12% ETO mixed with 88% CFC (referred to as 12/88 ETO). For several reasons, healthcare personnel have been exploring the use of new low -temperature sterilization technologies825, 851. First, CFCs were phased out in December 1995 under provisions of the Clean Air Act 852. CFCs were classified as a Class I substance under the Clean Air Act because of scientific evidence linking them to destruction of the earth's ozone layer. Second, some states (e.g., California, New York, Michigan) require t he use of ETO abatement technology to reduce the amount of ETO being released into ambient air from 90 to 99.9% depending on the state. Third, OSHA regulates the acceptable vapor levels of ETO (i.e., 1 ppm averaged over 8 hours) due to concerns that ETO ex posure represents an occupational haz ard318. These constraints have led to the development of alternative technologies for low -temperature sterilization in the healthcare setting. Alternative technologies to ETO with chlorofluorocarbon that are currently available and cleared by the FDA for medical equipment include 100% ETO; ETO with a different stabilizing gas, such as carbon dioxide or hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFC); i mmersion in peracetic acid; hydrogen peroxide gas plasma; and ozone. Technologies under development for use in healthcare facilities, but not cleared by the FDA, include vaporized hydrogen peroxide, vapor phase peracetic acid, gaseous chlorine dioxide, ionizing radiation, or pulsed light 400, 758, 853. However, there is no guarantee that these new sterilization technologies will receive FDA clearance for use in healthcare facilities. These new technologies should be compared against the characteristics of an ideal low -temperature (<60\u00b0C) sterilant (Table 9 ). 851 While it is apparent that all technologies will have limitations (Table 9), understanding the limitations imposed by restrictive device designs (e.g., long, narrow lumens ) is critical for proper application of new sterilization technology854. For example, the development of increasingly small and complex endoscopes presents a difficult challenge for current sterilization processes. This occurs because microorganisms must be in direct contact with the sterilant for inactivation to occur. Several peer -reviewed scientific publications have data demonstrating concerns about the efficacy of several of the low -temperature sterilization processes (i.e., gas plasma, vaporized hydrogen peroxide, ETO, peracetic acid), particularly when the test organisms are challenged in the presence of serum and salt and a narrow lumen vehi cle469, 721, 825, 855, 856. Factors shown to affect the efficacy of sterilization are shown in Table 10 . Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 63 of 163 Ethylene Oxide \"Gas\" Sterilization Overview. ETO is a colorless gas that is flammable and explosive. The four essential parameters (operational ranges) are: gas concentration (450 to 1200 mg/l); temperature (37 to 63 \u00b0C); relative humidity (40 to 80%)(water molecules carry ETO to reactive si tes); and exposure time (1 to 6 hours). These influence the effectiveness of ETO sterilization814, 857, 858. Within certain limitations, an increase in gas concentration and temperature may shorten the time necessary for achieving sterilization. The main disadvantages associated with ETO are the lengthy cycle time, the cost, and its potential hazards to patients and staff; the main advantage is that it can sterilize heat - or moisture- sensitive medical equipment without deleterious effects on the m aterial used in the medical devices (Table 6 ). Acute exposure to ETO may result in irritation (e.g., to skin, eyes, gastrointestinal or respiratory tracts) and central nervous system depression859-862. Chronic inhalation has been linked to the formation of cataracts, cognitive impairment, neurologic dysfunction, and disabling polyneuropathies860, 861, 863 -866. Occupational exposure in healthcare facilities has been linked to hematologic changes 867 and an increased risk of spontaneous abortions and various cancers318, 868-870. ETO should be considered a known human carcinogen871. The basic ETO sterilization cycle consists of five stages (i.e., preconditioning and humidification, gas introduction, exposure, evacuation, and air washes) and takes approximately 2 1/2 hrs excluding aeration time. Mechanical aeration for 8 to 12 hours at 50 to 60 \u00b0C allows desorption of the toxic ETO residual contained in exposed absorbent materials. Most modern ETO sterilizers combine sterilization and aeration in the same chamber as a continuous process. These ETO models minimize potential ETO exposure during door opening and load transfer to the aerator. Ambient room aeration also will achieve desorption of the toxic ETO but requires 7 days at 20 \u00b0C. There are no federal regulations for ETO sterilizer emission; however, many states have promulgated emission- control regulations814. The use of ETO evolved when few alternatives existed for sterilizing heat - and moisture- sensitive medical devices; however, favorable properties (Table 6) account for its continued widespread use872. Two ETO gas mixtures are available to replace ETO -chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) mixtures for large capacity, tank -supplied st erilizers. The ETO -carbon dioxide (CO 2) mixture consists of 8.5% ETO and 91.5% CO 2. This mixture is less expensive than ETO -hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFC), but a disadvantage is the need for pressure vessels rated for steam sterilization, because higher pressures (28- psi gauge) are required. The other mixture, which is a drop- in CFC replacement, is ETO mixed with HCFC. HCFCs are approximately 50- fold less damaging to the earth's ozone layer than are CFCs. The EPA will begin regulation of HCFC in the year 2015 and will terminate production in the year 2030. Two companies provide ETO -HCFC mixtures as drop- in replacement for CFC -12; one mixture consists of 8.6% ETO and 91.4% HCFC, and the other mixture is co mposed of 10% ETO and 90% HCFC872. An alternative to the pressurized mixed gas ETO systems is 100% ETO. The 100% ETO sterilizers using unit-dose cartridges eliminate the need for external tanks. ETO is absorbed by many materials. For this reason, following sterilization the item must undergo aeration to remove residual ETO. Guidelines have been promulgated regarding allowable ETO limits for devices that depend on how the device is used, how often, and how long in order to pose a minimal risk to patients in normal product use814. ETO toxicity has been established in a variety of animals. Exposure to ETO can cause eye pain, sore throat, difficulty breathing and blurred vision. Exposure can also cause dizziness, nausea, headache, convulsions, blisters and vomiting and coughing873. In a variety of in vitro and animal studies, ETO has been demonstrated to be carcinogenic. ETO has been linked to spontaneous abortion, genetic damage, nerve damage, peripheral paralysis, muscle weakness, and impaired thinking and memory873. Occupational exposure in healthcare facilities has been linked to an increased risk of spontaneous abortions and various cancers318. Injuries (e.g., tissue burns) to patients have been associated with ET O residues in implants used in surgical procedures874. Residual ETO in capillary flow dialysis membranes has been shown to be neurotoxic in vitro875. OSHA has established a PEL of 1 ppm airborne ETO in the workplace, expressed as a TWA for an 8- hour work shift in a 40- hour work week. The \"action level\" for Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 64 of 163 ETO is 0.5 ppm, expressed as an 8- hour TWA, and the short -term excursion limit is 5 ppm, expressed as a 15- minute TWA814. For details of the requirements in OSHA's ETO standard for occupational exposures, see Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 1910.1047873. Several personnel monitoring methods (e.g., charcoal tubes and passive sampling devices) are in use814. OSHA has established a PEL of 5 ppm for ethylene chlorohydrin (a toxic by -product of ETO) in the workplace876. Additional information regarding use of ETO in health care facilities is available from NIOSH. Mode of Action. The microbicidal activity of ETO is considered to be the result of alkylation of protein, DNA, and RNA. Alkylation, or the replacement of a hydrogen atom with an alkyl group, within cells prevents normal cellular metabolism and replication877. Microbicidal Activity. The excellent microbicidal activity of ETO has been demonstrated in several studies 469, 721, 722, 856, 878, 879 and summarized in published rep orts877. ETO inactivates all microorganisms although bacterial spores (especially B. atrophaeus ) are more resistant than other microorganisms. For this reason B. atrophaeus is the recommended biological indicator. Like all sterilization processes, the effectiveness of ETO sterilization can be altered by lumen length, lumen diameter, 855, 856, 879. For example, although ETO is not used commonly for reprocessing endoscopes28, several studies have shown failure of ETO in inactivating contaminating spores in endoscope channels 855or lumen test units 721, 879 and residual ETO levels averaging 66.2 ppm even after the standard degassing time456. Failure of ETO also has been observed when dental handpieces were contaminated with Streptococcus mutans and exposed to ETO880. It is recommended that dental handpieces be steam sterilized. Uses. ETO is used in healthcare facilities to sterilize critical items (and sometimes semicritical items) that are moisture or heat sensitive and cannot be sterilized by steam sterilization. Hydrogen Peroxide Gas Plasma Overview. New sterilization technology based on plasma was patent ed in 1987 and marketed in the United States in 1993. Gas plasmas have been referred to as the fourth state of matter (i.e., liquids, solids, gases, and gas plasmas). Gas plasmas are generated in an enclosed chamber under deep vacuum using radio frequency or microwave energy to excite the gas molecules and produce charged particles, many of which are in the form of free radicals. A free radical is an atom with an unpaired electron and is a highly reactive species. The proposed mechanism of action of this de vice is the production of free radicals within a plasma field that are capable of interacting with essential cell components (e.g., enzymes, nucleic acids) and thereby disrupt the metabolism of microorganisms. The type of seed gas used and the depth of the vacuum are two important variables that can determine the effectiveness of this process. In the late 1980s the first hydrogen peroxide gas plasma system for sterilization of medical and surgical devices was field- tested. According to the manufacturer, t he sterilization chamber is evacuated and hydrogen peroxide solution is injected from a cassette and is vaporized in the sterilization chamber to a concentration of 6 mg/l. The hydrogen peroxide vapor diffuses through the chamber (50 minutes), exposes all surfaces of the load to the sterilant, and initiates the inactivation of microorganisms. An electrical field created by a radio frequency is applied to the chamber to create a gas plasma. Microbicidal free radicals (e.g., hydroxyl and hydroperoxyl) are gen erated in the plasma. The excess gas is removed and in the final stage (i.e., vent) of the process the sterilization chamber is returned to atmospheric pressure by introduction of high- efficiency filtered air. The by -products of the cycle (e.g., water vapor, oxygen) are nontoxic and eliminate the need for aeration. Thus, the sterilized materials can be handled safely, either for immediate use or storage. The process operates in the range of 37- 44\u00b0C and has a cycle time of 75 minutes. If any moisture is present on the objects the vacuum will not be achieved and the cycle aborts856, 881 -883. A newer version of the unit improves sterilizer efficacy by using two cycles with a hydrogen peroxide Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 65 of 163 diffusion stage and a plasma stage per sterilization cycle. This revision, which is achieved by a software modification, reduces total processing time from 73 to 52 minutes. The manufacturer believes that the enhanced activity obtained with this system is due in part to the pressure changes that occur during the injection and di ffusion phases of the process and to the fact that the process consists of two equal and consecutive half cycles, each with a separate injection of hydrogen peroxide. 856, 884, 885 This system and a smaller version 400, 882 have received FDA 510[k] clearance with limited application for sterilization of medical devices (Table 6). The biological indicator used with this system is Bacillus atrophaeus spores851. The newest version of the unit, which employs a new vaporization system that removes most of the water from the hydrogen peroxide, has a cycle time from 28- 38 minutes (see manufacturer's literature for device dimension restrictions). Penetration of hydrogen peroxide vapor into long or narrow lumens has been addressed outside the United States by the use of a diffusion enhancer. This is a small, breakable glass ampoule of concentrated hydrogen peroxide (50%) with an elastic connector that is inserted into the device lumen and crushed immediately before sterilization470, 885. The diffusion enhancer has been shown to sterilize bronc hoscopes contaminated with Mycobacteria tuberculosis886. At the present time, the diffusion enhancer is not FDA cleared. Another gas plasma system, which differs from the above in several important ways, including the use of peracetic acid- acetic acid-hydrogen peroxide vapor, was removed from the marketplace because of reports of corneal destruction to patients when ophthalmic surgery instruments had been processed in the sterilizer887, 888. In this investigation, exposure of potentially wet ophthalmologic surgical instruments with small bores and brass components to the plasma gas led to degradation of the brass to copper and zinc888, 889. The experimenters showed that when rabbit eyes were exposed to the rinsates of the gas plasma- sterilized instruments , corneal decompensation was documented. This toxicity is highly unlikely with the hydrogen peroxide gas plasma process since a toxic, soluble form of copper would not form (LA Feldman, written communication, April 1998). Mode of Action. This process inactivates microorganisms primarily by the combined use of hydrogen peroxide gas and the generation of free radicals (hydroxyl and hydroproxyl free radicals) during the plasma phase of the cycle. Microbicidal Activity. This process has the ability to inactivate a broad range of microorganisms, including resistant bacterial spores. Studies have been conducted against vegetative bacteria (including mycobacteria), yeasts, fungi, viruses, and bacterial spores469, 721, 856, 881 -883, 890 -893. Like all sterilization processes, the effectiveness can be altered by lumen length, lumen diameter, inorganic salts, and organic materials469, 721, 855, 856, 890, 891, 893. Uses. Materials and devices that cannot tolerate high temperatures and humidity, such as some plastics, electrical devices, and corrosion- susceptible metal alloys, can be sterilized by hydrogen peroxide gas plasma. This method has been compatible with most (>95%) medical devices and materials tested884, 894, 895. Peracetic Acid Sterilization Overview. Peracetic acid is a highly biocidal oxidizer that maintains its efficacy in the presence of organic soil. Peracetic acid removes surface contaminants (primarily protein) on endoscopic tubing711, 717. An automated machine us ing peracetic acid to sterilize medical, surgical, and dental instruments chemically (e.g., endoscopes, arthroscopes) was introduced in 1988. This microprocessor -controlled, low - temperature sterilization method is commonly used in the United States107. The sterilant, 35% peracetic acid, and an anticorrosive agent are supplied in a single- dose container. The container is punctured at the time of use, immediately prior to closing the lid and initiating the cycle. The concentrated peracetic acid is diluted to 0.2% with filtered water ( 0.2 \u00b5m) at a temperature of approximately 50 \u00b0C. The diluted peracetic Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 66 of 163 acid is circulated within the chamber of the machine and pumped through the channels of the endoscope for 12 minutes, decontaminating exterior surfaces, lumens, and accessories. Interchangeable trays are available to permit the processing of up to three rigid endoscopes or one flexible endoscope. Connectors are available for most types of flexible endoscopes for the irrigation of all channels by directed flow. Rigid endoscopes are placed within a lidded container, and the sterilant fills the lumens either by immersion in the circulating sterilant or by use of channel connectors to direct flow into the lumen(s) (see below for the importance of channel connectors). The peracetic acid is discarded via the sewer and the instrument rinsed four times with filtered water. Concern has been raised that filtered water may be inadequate to maintain sterility896. Limited data have shown that low -level bacterial contamination may follow the use of filtered water in an AER but no data has been published on AERs using the peracetic acid system161. Clean filtered air is passed through the chamber of the machine and endoscope channels to remove excess water719. As with any sterilization process, the system can only sterilize surfaces that can be contacted by the sterilant. For example, bronchoscopy -related infections occurred when bronchoscopes were processed using the wrong connector155, 725. Investigation of these incidents revealed that bronchoscopes were inadequately reprocessed when inappropriate channel connectors were used and when there were inconsistencies between the reprocessing instructions provided by the manufacturer of the bronchoscope and the manufacturer of the automatic endoscope reprocessor155. The importance of channel connectors to achieve sterilization was also shown for rigid lumen devices137, 856. The manufacturers suggest the use of biological monitors ( G. stearothermophilus spore strips) both at the time of installation and routinely to ensure effectiveness of the process. The manufacturer's clip must be used to hold the strip in the designated spot in the machine as a broader clamp will not allow the sterilant to reach the spores trapped under it897. One investigator reported a 3% failure rate when the appropriate clips were used to hold the spore strip within the machine718. The use of biological monitors designed to monitor either steam sterilization or ETO for a liquid chemical sterilizer has been questioned for several reasons including spore wash- off from the filter paper strips which may cause less valid monitoring898-901. The processor is equipped with a conductivity probe that will automatically abort the cycle if the buffer system is not detected in a fresh container of the peracetic acid solution. A chemical monitoring strip that detects that the active ingredient is >1500 ppm is available for routine use as an additional process control. Mode of Action. Only limited information is available regarding the mechanism of action of peracetic acid, but it is thought to function as other oxidizing agents, i.e., it denatures proteins, disrupts cell wall permeability, and oxidizes sulfhydral and sulfur bonds in proteins, enzymes, and other metabolites654, 726. Microbicidal Activity. Peracetic acid will inactivate gram -positive and gram -negative bacteria, fungi, and yeasts in <5 minutes at <100 ppm. In the presence of organic matter, 200- 500 ppm is required. For viruses, the dosage range is wide (12- 2250 ppm), with poliovirus inactivated in yeast extract in 15 minutes with 1500 to 2250 ppm. Bacterial spores in suspension are inactivated in 15 seconds to 30 minutes with 500 to 10,000 ppm (0.05 to 1%)654. Simulated -use trials have demonstrated microbicidal activity 111, 718- 722 and three clinical trials have demonstrated both microbial killing and no clinical failures leading to infection90, 723, 724. Alfa and co- workers, who compared the peracetic acid system with ETO, demonstrated the high efficacy of the system. Only the peracetic acid system was able to completely kill 6- log10 Mycobacterium chelonae , Enterococcus faecalis , both an organic and inorganic challenge722. Like other sterilization processes, the efficacy of the process can be diminished by soil challenges 902 and test conditions856. Uses. This automated machine is used to chemically sterilize medical (e.g., GI endoscopes) and surgical (e.g., flexible endoscopes) instruments in the United States. Lumened endoscopes must be connected to an appropriate channel connector to ensure that the sterilant has direct contact with the contaminated lumen. 137, 856, 903 Olympus America has not listed this system as a compatible product for Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 67 of 163 use in reprocessing Olympus bronchoscopes and gastrointestinal endoscopes (Olympus America, January 30, 2002, written communication). Microbicidal Activity of Low -Temperature Sterilization Technologies Sterilization processes used in the United States must be cleared by FDA, and they require that sterilizer microbicidal performance be tested under simulated- use conditions904. FDA requires that the test article be inoculated with 106 colony -forming units of the most resistant test organism and prepared with organic and inorganic test loads as would occur after actual use. FDA requires manufacturers to use organic soil (e.g., 5% fetal calf serum), dried onto the device with the inoculum, to represent soil remaining on the device following marginal cleaning. However, 5% fetal calf serum as a measure of marginal cleaning has not been validated by measurements of protein load on devices following use and the level of protein removal by various cleaning methods. The inocula must be placed in various locations of the test articles, including those least favorable to penetration and contact with the sterilant (e.g., lumens). Cleaning before sterilization is not allowed in the demonstration of sterilization efficacy904. Several studies have evaluated the relative microbicidal efficacy of these low -temperature sterilization technologies (Table 11). These studies have either tested the activity of a sterilization process against specific microorganisms892, 905, 906, evaluated the microbicidal activity of a singular technology 711, 719, 724, 855, 879, 882 -884, 890, 891, 907 or evaluated the comparative effectiveness of several sterilization technologies271, 426, 469, 721, 722, 856, 908, 909. Several test methodologies use stainless steel or porcelain carriers that are inoculated with a test or ganism. Commonly used test organisms include vegetative bacteria, mycobacteria, and spores of Bacillus species. The available data demonstrate that low -temperature sterilization technologies are able to provide a 6- log10 reduction of microbes when inoculat ed onto carriers in the absence of salt and serum. However, tests can be constructed such that all of the available sterilization technologies are unable to reliably achieve complete inactivation of a microbial load. 425, 426, 469, 721, 856, 909 For example, almost all of the sterilization processes will fail to reliably inactivate the microbial load in the presence of salt and serum469, 721, 909. The effect of salts and serums on the sterilization process were studied initially in the 1950s and 1960s424, 910. These studies showed that a high concentration of crystalline- type materials and a low protei n content provided greater protection to spores than did serum with a high protein content426. A study by Doyle and Ernst demonstrated resistance of spores by crystalline material applied not only to low-temperature sterilization technology but also to steam and dry heat425. These studies showed that occlusion of Bacillus atrophaeus spores in calc ium carbonate crystals dramatically increased the time required for inactivation as follows: 10 seconds to 150 minutes for steam (121\u00b0C ), 3.5 hours to 50 hours for dry heat (121 \u00b0C), 30 seconds to >2 weeks for ETO (54\u00b0C ). Investigators have corroborated and extended these findings469, 470, 721, 855, 908, 909. While soils containing both organic and inorganic materials impair microbial killing, soils that contain a high inorganic salt -to-protein rati o favor crystal formation and impair sterilization by occlusion of organisms425, 426, 881. Alfa and colleagues demonstrated a 6- log10 reduction of the microbial inoculum of porcelain penicylinders using a variety of vegetative and spore- forming organisms (Table 11 )469. However, if the bacterial inoculum was in tissue- culture medium supplemented wi th 10% serum, only the ETO 12/88 and ETO-HCFC sterilization mixtures could sterilize 95% to 97% of the penicylinder carriers. The plasma and 100% ETO sterilizer demonstrated significantly reduced activity (Table 11 ). For all sterilizers evaluated using pen icylinder carriers (i.e., ETO 12/88, 100% ETO, hydrogen peroxide gas plasma), there was a 3- to 6-log10 reduction of inoculated bacteria even in the presence of serum and salt. For each sterilizer evaluated, the ability to inactivate microorganisms in the presence of salt and serum was reduced even further when the inoculum was placed in a narrow -lumen test object (3 mm diameter by 125 cm long). Although there was a 2- to 4-log10 reduction in microbial kill, less than 50% of the lumen test objects were sterile when processed using any of the sterilization methods evaluated except the peracetic acid immersion system (Table 11 )721. Complete killing (or of 6- log10 of Enterococcus faecalis, Mycobacterium chelonei , and Bacillus atrophaeus in the presence of salt and serum and lumen test objects was observed only for the peracetic acid immersion system. Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 68 of 163 With respect to the results by Alfa and coworkers469, Jacobs showed that the us e of the tissue culture media created a technique- induced sterilization failure426. Jacobs et al. s howed that microorganisms mixed with tissue culture media, used as a surrogate body fluid, formed physical crystals that protected the microorganisms used as a challenge. If the carriers were exposed for 60 sec to nonflowing water, the salts dissolved and the protective effect disappeared. Since any device would be exposed to water for a short period of time during the washing procedure, these protective effects would have little clinical relevance426. Narrow lumens provide a challenge to some low -temperature sterilization processes. For example, Rutala and colleagues showed that, as lumen size decreased, increased failures occurred with some low - temperature sterilization technologies. However, some low -temperature processes such as ETO -HCFC and the hydrogen peroxide gas plasma process remained effective even when challenged by a lumen as small as 1 mm in the absence of salt and serum856. The importance of allowing the sterilant to come into contact with the inoculated carrier is demonstrated by comparing the results of two investigators who studied the peracetic acid immersion system. Alfa and coworkers demonstrated excellent activity of the peracetic acid immersion system against three test organisms using a narrow -lumen device. In these experiments, the lumen test object was connected to channel irrigators, which ensured that the sterilant had direct contact with the contaminated carriers722. This effectiveness w as achieved through a combination of organism wash- off and peracetic acid sterilant killing the test organisms722. The data reported by Rutala et al. demonstrated failure of the p eracetic acid immersion system to eliminate Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores from a carrier placed in a lumen test object. In these experiments, the lumen test unit was not connected to channel irrigators. The authors attributed the failure of the peracetic acid immersion system to eliminate the high levels of spores from the center of the test unit to the inability of the peracetic acid to diffuse into the center of 40- cm long, 3- mm diameter tubes. This may be caused by an air lock or air bubbles f ormed in the lumen, impeding the flow of the sterilant through the long and narrow lumen and limiting complete access to the Bacillus spores137, 856. Experiments using a channel connector specifically designed for 1- , 2-, and 3- mm lumen test units with the peracetic acid immersion system were completely effective in eliminating an inoculum of 106 Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores7. The restricted diffusion environment that exists in the test conditions would not exist with flexible scopes processed in the peracetic acid immersion system, because the scopes are connected to channel irrigators to ensure that the sterilant has direct contact with contaminated surfaces. Alfa and associates attributed the efficacy of the peracetic acid immersion system to the ability of the liquid chemical process to dissolve salts and remove protein and bacteri a due to the flushing action of the fluid722. Bioburden of Surgical Devices In general, used medical devices are contaminated with a relatively low bioburden of organisms179, 911, 912. Nystrom evaluated medical instruments used in general surgical, gynecological, orthopedic, and ear - nose- throat operations and found that 62% of the instr uments were contaminated with <101 organisms after use, 82% with <102, and 91% with <103. After being washed in an instrument washer, more than 98% of the instruments had <101 organisms, and none >102 organisms911. Other investigators have published similar findings179, 912. For example, after a standard cleaning procedure, 72% of 50 surgical instruments contained <101 organisms, 86% <102, and only 6% had >3 X 102912. In another study of rigid- lumen medical devices, the bioburden on both the inner and outer surface of the lumen ranged from 101 to 104 organis ms per device. After cleaning, 83% of the devices had a bioburden 102 organisms179. In all of these studies, the contaminating microflora consisted mainly of vegetative bacteria, usually of low pathogenicity (e.g., coagul ase-negative Staphylococcus )179, 911, 912. An evaluat ion of the microbial load on used critical medical devices such as spinal anesthesia needles and angi ographic catheters and sheaths demonstrated that m esophilic microorganisms were detected at levels of 101 to 102 in only two of five needles. The bioburden on used angiographic catheters Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 69 of 163 and sheath introducers exceeded 103 CFUs on 14% (3 of 21) and 21% (6 of 28), respectively907. Effect of Cleaning on Sterilization Efficacy The effect of salt and serum on the efficacy of low -temperature sterilization technologies has raised concern regarding the margin of safety of t hese technologies. Experiments have shown that salts have the gr eatest impact on protecting microorganisms from killing426, 469 . However, other studies have suggest ed that these concerns may not be clinically relevant. One study evaluated the relative rate of removal of inorganic salts, organic soil, and microorganisms from medical devices to better understand the dynamics of the cleaning process 426. These tests were conducted by inoculating Alfa soil (tissue- culture media and 10% fetal bovine serum) 469 containing 106 G. stearothermophi lus spores onto the surface of a stainless -steel scalpel blade. After drying for 30 minutes at 35 \u00b0C followed by 30 minutes at room temperature, the samples were placed in water at room temperature. The blades were removed at specified times, and the concentration of total protein and chloride ion was measured. The results showed that soaking in deionized water for 60 seconds resulted in a >95% release rate of chloride ion from NaCl solution in 20 seconds, Alfa soil in 30 seconds, and fetal bovine serum in 120 seconds. Thus, contact with water for short periods, even in the presence of protein, rapidly leads to dissolution of salt crystals and complete inactivation of spores by a low -temperature sterilization process (Table 10 ). Based on these experimental data, cleaning procedures would eliminate the detrimental effect of high salt content on a low-temperature sterilization process. These articles 426, 469, 721 assessing low -temperature sterilization technology reinforce the importance of meticulous cleaning before sterilization. These data support the critical need for healthcare facilities to develop rigid protocols for cleaning contaminated objects before sterilization472. Sterilization of instruments and medical devices is compromised if the process is not preceded by meticulous cleaning. The cleaning of any narrow -lumen medical device used in patient care presents a major challenge to reproc essing areas. While attention has been focused on flexible endoscopes, cleaning issues related to other narrow -lumen medical devices such as sphinct ertomes have been investigated913. This study compared manual cleaning with tha t of automated cleaning with a narrow -lumen cleaner and found that only retro- flushing with the narrow lumen cleaner provided adequate cleaning of the three channels. If reprocessing was delayed for more than 24 hours, retro- flush cleaning was no longer ef fective and ETO sterilization failure was detected when devices were held for 7 days 913. In another study involving simulated- use cleaning of laparoscopic devices, Alfa found that minimally the use of retro- flushing should be used during cleaning of non- ported laparoscopic devices914. Other Sterilization Methods Ionizing Radiation. Sterilization by ionizing radiation, primarily by cobalt 60 gamma rays or electron accelerators, is a low -temperature sterilization method that has been used for a number of medical products (e.g., tissue for transplantation, pharmaceuticals, medical devices). There are no FDA -cleared ionizing radiation sterilization processes for use in healthcare facilities. Because of high sterilization costs, this method is an unfavorable alternative to ETO and plasma sterilization in healthcare facilities but is suitable for large- scale sterilization. Some deleterious effects on patient -care equipment associated with gamma radiation include induced oxidation in polyethylene 915 and delamination and cracking in polyethylene knee bearings916. Several reviews 917, 91 8 dealing with the sources, effects, and application of ionizing radiation may be referred to for more detail. Dry-Heat Sterilizers. This method should be used only for materials that might be damaged by moist heat or that are impenetrable to moist heat (e.g., powders, petroleum products, sharp instruments). The advantages for dry heat include the following: it is nontoxic and does not harm the environment; a dry heat cabinet is easy to install and has relatively low operating costs; it penetrates materials; and it is noncorrosive for metal and sharp instruments. The disadvantages for dry heat are the slow rate of heat penetration and microbial killing makes this a time- consuming method. In addition, the high temperatures Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 70 of 163 are not suitable for most mat erials919. The most c ommon time- temperature relationships for sterilization with hot air sterilizers are 170\u00b0C (340\u00b0F ) for 60 minutes, 160\u00b0C (320\u00b0F) for 120 minutes, and 150 \u00b0C (300\u00b0F ) for 150 minutes. B. atrophaeus spores should be used to monitor the sterilization process for dry heat because they are more resistant to dry heat than are G. stearothermophilus spores. The primary lethal process is considered to be oxidation of cell constituents. There are two types of dry -heat sterilizers: the static -air type and the forced- air type. The static -air type is referred to as the oven- type sterilizer as heating coils in the bottom of the unit cause the hot air to rise inside the chamber via gravity convection. This type of dry -heat sterilizer is much slower in heating, requires longer time to reach sterilizing temperature, and is less uniform in temperature control throughout the chamber than is the forced- air type. The forced- air or mechanical convection sterilizer is equipped with a motor -driven blower that circulates heated air throughout the chamber at a high velocity, permitting a more rapid transfer of energy f rom the air to the instruments920. Liquid Chemicals. Several FDA -cleared liquid chemical sterilants include indications for sterilization of medical devices (Tables 4 and 5)69. The indicated contact times r ange from 3 hours to 12 hours. However, except for a few of the products, the contact time is based only on the conditions to pass the AOAC Sporicidal Test as a sterilant and not on simulated use testing with devices. These solutions are commonly used as high- level disinfectants when a shorter processing time is required. Generally, chemical liquid sterilants cannot be monitored using a biological indicator to verify sterility899, 90 0. The survival kinetics for thermal sterilization methods, such as steam and dry heat, have been studied and characterized extensively, whereas the kinetics for sterilization with liquid steri lants are less well understood921. The information that is available in t he literature suggests that sterilization processes based on liquid chemical sterilants, in general, may not convey the same sterility assurance level as sterilization achieved usi ng thermal or physical methods823. The data indicate that the survival curves for liquid chemic al sterilants may not exhibit log- linear kinetics and the shape of the survivor curve may vary depending of the formulation, chemical nature and stability of the liquid chemical sterilant. In addition, the design of the AOAC Sporicidal Test does not provid e quantification of the microbial challenge. Therefore, sterilization with a liquid chemical sterilant may not convey the same sterility assurance as other sterilization methods. One of the differences between thermal and liquid chemical processes for st erilization of devices is the accessibility of microorganisms to the sterilant. Heat can penetrate barriers, such as biofilm, tissue, and blood, to attain organism kill, whereas liquids cannot adequately penetrate these barriers. In addition, the viscosity of some liquid chemical sterilants impedes their access to organisms in the narrow lumens and mated surfaces of devices922. Another limitation to sterilization of devices with liquid chemical germicides is the post -processing environment of the device. Devices cannot be wrapped or adequately contained during processing in a liquid chemical sterilant to maintain sterility following processing and during storage. Furthermore, devices may require rinsing following exposure to the liquid chemical sterilant with water that typically is not sterile. Therefore, due to the inherent limitations of using liquid chemical sterilants, their use should be rest ricted to reprocessing critical devices that are heat -sensitive and incompatible with other sterilization methods . Several published studies compare the sporicidal effect of liquid chemical germicides against spores of Bacillus and Clostridium78, 659, 660, 715. Acid. Perfo rmic acid is a fast -acting sporicide that was incorporated into an automated endoscope reprocessing system400. Systems using performic acid are not currently FDA cleared. Filtration. Although filtration is not a lethality -based process and is not an FDA -cleared sterilization method, this technology is used to remove bacteria from thermolabile pharmaceutical flu ids that cannot be purified by any other means. In order to remove bacteria, the membrane pore size (e.g., 0.22 \u00b5m) Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 71 of 163 must be smaller than the bacteria and uniform throughout923. Some investigators have appropriately questioned whether the removal of microorganisms by filtration really is a sterilization method because of slight bacterial passage through filters, viral passage through filters, and transference of the sterile filtrate into the final container under aseptic conditions entail a risk of contaminatio n924. Microwa ve. Microwaves are used in medicine for disinfection of soft contact lenses, dental instruments, dentures, milk, and urinary catheters for intermittent self -catheterization925-931. However, microwaves must only be used with products that are compatible (e.g., do not melt) 931. Microwaves are radio- frequency waves, which are usually used at a frequency of 2450 MHz. The microwaves produce friction of water molecules in an alternating electrical field. The intermolecular friction derived from the vibrations generates heat and some authors believe that the effect of microwaves depends on the heat produced while others postulate a nonthermal lethal effect932-934. The initial reports showed microwaves to be an effec tive microbicide. The microwaves produced by a \"home- type\" microwave oven (2.45 GHz) completely inactivate bacterial cultures, mycobacteria, viruses, and G. stearothermophilus spores within 60 seconds to 5 minutes depending on the challenge organism933, 935-937. Another study confirmed these resuIts but also found that higher power microwaves in the presence of water may be needed for sterilization932. Complete destruction of Mycobacterium bovis was obtained with 4 minutes of microwave exposure (600W, 2450 MHz)937. The effectiveness of microwave ovens for different sterilization and disinfection purposes should be tested and demonstrated as test conditions affect the results (e.g., presence of water, microwave power). Sterilization of metal instruments can be accomplished but requires certain precautions.926. Of concern is that home- type microwave ovens may not have even distribution of microwave energy ov er the entire dry device (there may be hot and cold spots on solid medical devices); hence there may be areas that are not sterilized or disinfected. The use of microwave ovens to disinfect intermittent -use catheters also has been suggested. Researchers found that test bacteria (e.g., E. coli , Klebsiella pneumoniae, Candida albicans ) were eliminated from red rubber catheters within 5 minutes 931. Microwaves used for sterilization of medical devices have not been FDA cleared. Glass Bead \"Sterilizer\". Glass bead \"sterilization\" uses small glass beads (1.2- 1.5 mm diameter) and high temperature (217 \u00b0C -232\u00b0C) for brief exposure times (e.g., 45 seconds) to inactivate microorganisms. These devices have been used for several years in the dental profession938-940. FDA believes there is a risk of infect ion with this device because of potential failure to sterilize dental instruments and their use should be discontinued until the device has received FDA clearance. Vaporized Hydrogen Peroxide (VHP ). Hydrogen peroxide solutions have been used as chemical sterilants for many years. However, the VHP was not developed for the sterilization of medical equipment until the mid- 1980s. One method for delivering VHP to the r eaction site uses a deep vacuum to pull liquid hydrogen peroxide (30- 35% concentration) from a disposable cartridge through a heated vaporizer and then, following vaporization, into the sterilization chamber. A second approach to VHP delivery is the flow -through approach in which the VHP is carried into the sterilization chamber by a carrier gas such as air using either a slight negative pressure (vacuum) or slight positive pressure. Applications of this technology include vacuum systems for industrial ster ilization of medical devices and atmospheric systems for decontaminating for large and small areas853. VHP offers several appealing features that include rapid cycle time (e.g., 30- 45 minutes); low temperature; environmentally safe by - products (H 2O, oxygen [O 2]); good material compatibility; and ease of operation, installation and monitoring. VHP has limitations including that cellulose cannot be processed; nylon becomes brittle; and VHP penetration capabilities are less than those of ETO. VHP has not been cleared by FDA for sterilization of medical devices in healt hcare facilities. The feasibility of utilizing vapor -phase hydrogen peroxide as a surface decontaminant and sterilizer was evaluated in a centrifuge decontamination application. In this study, vapor -phase hydrogen peroxide was shown to possess significant sporicidal activity 941. In preliminary studies, hydrogen peroxide vapor decontamination has been found to be a highly effective method of eradicating MRSA, Serratia Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 72 of 163 marcescens, Clostridium botulinum spores and Clostridium diff icile from rooms, furniture, surfaces and/or equipment; however, further investigation of this method to demonstrate both safety and effectiveness in reducing infection rates are required942-945. Ozone. Ozone has been used for years as a drinking water disinfectant. Ozone is produced when O 2 is energized and split into two monatomic (O 1) molecules. The monatomic oxygen molecules then collide with O 2 molecules to form ozone, which is O 3. Thus, ozone consists of O 2 with a loosely bonded third oxygen atom that is readily available to attach to, and oxidize, other molecules. This additional oxygen atom makes ozone a powerful oxidant that destroys microorganisms but is highly unstable (i.e., half -life of 22 minutes at room temperature). A new sterilization process, which uses ozone as the sterilant, was cleared by FDA in August 2003 for processing reusable medical devices. The sterilizer creates its own sterilant internally from USP grade oxygen, steam -quality water and electricity; the sterilant is converted back to oxygen and water vapor at the end of the cycle by a passing through a catalyst before being exhausted into the room. The duration of the sterilization cycle is about 4 h and 15 m, and it occurs at 30- 35\u00b0C . Microbial efficacy has been demonstrated by achieving a SAL of 10-6 with a variety of microorganisms to include the most resistant microorganism, Geobacillus stearothermophilus . The ozone process is compatible with a wide range of commonly used materials including stainless steel, titanium, anodized aluminum, ceramic, glass, silica, PVC, Teflon, silicone, polypropylene, polyethylene and acrylic. In addition, rigid lumen devices of the following diameter and length can be processed: internal diameter ( ID): > 2 mm, length 25 cm; ID > 3 mm, length 47 cm; and ID > 4 mm, lengt h 60 cm . The process should be safe for use by the operator because there is no handling of the sterilant, no toxic emissions, no residue to aerate, and low operating temperature means there is no danger of an accidental burn. The cycle is monitored us ing a self -contained biological indicator and a chemical indicator. The sterilization chamber is small, about 4 ft3 (Written communication, S Dufresne, July 2004). A gaseous ozone generator was investigated for decontamination of rooms used to house pat ients colonized with MRSA. The results demonstrated that the device tested would be inadequate for the decontamination of a hospital room946. Formaldehyde Steam. Low-temperature steam with formaldehyde is used as a low -temperature sterilization method in many countries, particularly in Scandinavia, Germany, and the United Kingdom. The process involves the use of formalin, which is vaporized into a formaldehyde gas that is admitted into the sterilization chamber. A formaldehyde concentration of 8- 16 mg/l is generated at an operating temperature of 70- 75\u00b0C. The sterilization cycle consists of a series of stages that include an initial vacuum to remove air from the chamber and load, followed by steam admission to the chamber with the vacuum pump running to purge the chamber of air and to heat the load, followed by a series of pulses of formaldehyde gas, followed by steam. Formaldehyde is removed from the sterilizer and load by repeated alternate evacuations and flushing with steam and air. This system has some advantages, e.g., the cycle time for formaldehyde gas is faster than that for ETO and the cost per cycle is relatively low. However, ETO is more penetrating and operates at lower temperatures than do steam/formaldehyde sterilizers. Low-temperature steam formaldehyde sterilization has been found effective against vegetative bacteria, mycobacteria, B. atrophaeus and G. stearothermophilus spores and Candida albicans947-949. Formaldehyde vapor cabinets also may be used in healthcare facilities to sterilize heat -sensitive medical equ ipment950. Commonly, there is no circulation of formaldehyde and no temperature and humidity controls. The release of gas from paraformaldehyde tablets (placed on the lower tray) is slow and produces a low partial pressure of gas. The microbicidal qualit y of this procedure is unknown951. Reliable sterilization using formaldehyde is achieved when performed with a high concentration of Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 73 of 163 gas, at a temperature between 60\u00b0 and 80 \u00b0C and with a relative humidity of 75 to 100%. Studies indicate that formaldehyde is a mutagen and a potential human carcinogen, and OSHA regulates formaldehyde. The permissible exposure limit for formaldehyde in work areas is 0.75 ppm measured as a 8- hour TWA. The OSHA standard includes a 2 ppm STEL (i.e., maximum expos ure allowed during a 15- minute period). As with the ETO standard, the formaldehyde standard requires that the employer conduct initial monitoring to identify employees who are exposed to formaldehyde at or above the action level or STEL. If this exposure l evel is maintained, employers may discontinue exposure monitoring until there is a change that could affect exposure levels or an employee reports formaldeh yde- related signs and symptoms269, 578. The formaldehyde steam sterilization system has not been FDA cleared for use in healthcare facilities. Gaseous chlorine dioxide. A gaseous chlorine dioxide system for sterilization of healthcare products was developed in the late 1980s853, 952, 953. Chlorine dioxide is not mutage nic or carcinogenic in humans. As the chlorine dioxide concentration increases, the time required to achieve sterilization becomes progressively shorter. For example, only 30 minutes were required at 40 mg/l to sterilize the 106 B. atrophaeus spores at 30\u00b0 to 32 \u00b0C954. Currently, no gaseous chlorine dioxide system is FDA cleared. Vaporized Peracetic Acid. The sporicidal activity of peracetic acid vapor at 20, 40, 60, and 80% relative humidity and 25 \u00b0C was determined on Bacillus atrophaeus spores on paper and glass surfaces. Appreciable activity occurred within 10 minutes of exposure to 1 mg of peracetic acid per liter at 40% or higher relative humidity955. No vaporized peracetic acid system is FDA cleared. Infrared radiation. An infrared radiation pr ototype sterilizer was investigated and found to destroy B. atrophaeus spores. Some of the possible advantages of infrared technology include short cycle time, low energy consumption, no cycle residuals, and no toxicologic or environmental effects. This may provide an alternative technology for sterilization of selected heat -resistant instruments but there are no FDA -cleared systems for use in healthcare facilities 956. The other sterilization technologies mentioned above may be used for sterilization of critical medical items if cleared by the FDA and ideally, the microbicidal effectiveness of the technology has been published in the scientific literature. The selection and use of disinfectants, chemical sterilants and sterilization processes in the healthcare field is dynamic, and products may become available that are n ot in existence when this guideline was written. As newer disinfectants and sterilization processes become available, persons or committees responsible for selecting disinfectants and sterilization processes should be guided by products cleared by FDA and EPA as well as information in the scientific literature. Sterilizing Practices Overview. The delivery of sterile products for use in patient care depends not only on the effectiveness of the sterilization process but also on the unit design, d econtamination, disassembling and packaging of the device, loading the sterilizer, monitoring, sterilant quality and quantity, and the appropriateness of the cycle for the load contents, and other aspects of device reprocessing. Healthcare personnel should perform most cleaning, disinfecting, and sterilizing of patient -care supplies in a central processing department in order to more easily control quality. The aim of central processing is the orderly processing of medical and surgical instruments to protec t patients from infections while minimizing risks to staff and preserving the value of the items being reprocessed957. Healthcare facilities should promote the same level of efficiency and safety in the preparation of supplies in other areas (e.g., operating room, respiratory therapy) as is practiced in central processing. Ensuring consistency of sterilization practices requires a comprehensive program that ensures operator competence and proper methods of cleaning and wrapping instruments, loading the sterilizer, operating the sterilizer, and monitoring of the entire process. Furthermore, care must be consistent from Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 74 of 163 an infection prevention standpoint in all patient -care settings, such as hospital and outpatient facilities. Sterilization C ycle Verification . A steriliza tion process should be verified before it is put into use in healthcare settings. All steam, ETO, and other low -temperature sterilizers are tested with biological and chemical indicators upon installation, when the sterilizer is relocated, redesigned, after major repair and after a sterilization failure has occurred to ensure they are functioning prior to placing them into routine use. Three consecutive empty steam cycles are run with a biological and chemical indicator in an appropriate test package or tray. Each type of steam cycle used for sterilization (e.g., vacuum -assisted, gravity) is tested separately. In a prevacuum steam sterilizer three consecutive empty cycles are also run with a Bowie -Dick test. The sterilizer is not put back into use until all biological indicators are negative and chemical indicators show a correct end- point response811-814, 819, 958. Biological and chemical indicator testing is also done for ongoing quality assurance testing of representative samples of actual products being sterilized and product testing when major changes are made in packaging, wraps, or load configuration. Biological and chemical indicators are placed in products, which are processed in a full load. When three consecutive cycles show negative biological indicators and chemical indicators with a correct end point response, you can put the change made into routine use811-814, 958. Items processed during the three evaluation cycles should be quarantined until the test results are negative. Physical Facilities. The central processing area(s) ideally should be divided into at least three areas: decontamination, packaging, and sterilization and storage. Physical barriers should separate the decontamination area from the other sections to contain contamination on used items. In the decontamination area reusable contaminated supplies (and possibly disposable items that are reused) are received, sorted, and decontaminated. The recommended airflow pattern should contain contaminates within the decontamination area and minimize the flow of contaminates to the clean areas. The American Insti tute of Architects 959 recommends negative pressure and no fewer than six air exchanges per hour in the decontamination area (AAMI recommends 10 air changes per hour) and 10 air changes per hour with positive pressure in the sterilizer equipment room. The packaging area is for inspecting, assembling, and packaging clean, but not sterile, material. The sterile storage area should be a limited access area with a controlled temperature (may be as high as 75 \u00b0F) and relative humidity (30- 60% in all works areas except sterile storage, where the relative humidity should not exceed 70% )819. The floors and walls should be constructed of materials capable of withstanding chemical agents used for cleaning or disinfecting. Ceilings and wall surfaces should be constructed of non- shedding materials. Physical arrangements of processing areas are presented schematically in four references811, 819, 920, 957. Cleaning. As repeatedly mentioned, items must be cleaned using water with detergents or enzymatic cleaners 465, 466, 468 before processing. Cleaning reduces the bioburden and removes foreign material (i.e., organic residue and inorganic salts) that interferes with the sterilization process by acting as a barrier to the sterilization agent179, 426, 457, 911, 912. Surgical instruments are generally presoaked or prerinsed to prevent drying of blood and tissue. Precleaning in patient -care areas may be needed on items that are heavily soiled with feces, sputum, blood, or other material. Items sent to central processing without removing gross soil may be difficult to clean because of dri ed secretions and excretions. Cleaning and decontamination should be done as soon as possible after items have been used. Several types of mechanical cleaning machines (e.g., utensil washer -sanitizer, ultrasonic cleaner, washer -sterilizer, dishwasher, washer -disinfector) may facilitate cleaning and decontamination of most items. This equipment often is automated and may increase productivity, improve cleaning effectiveness, and decrease worker exposure to blood and body fluids. Delicate and intricate objects and heat - or moisture- sensitive articles may require careful cleaning by hand. All used items sent to the central processing area should be considered contaminated (unless decontaminated in the area of origin), handled with gloves (forceps or tongs are sometimes needed to avoid exposure to sharps), and decontaminated by one of the aforementioned methods to render them safer to handle. Items composed of more than one removable part should be disassembled. Care should be taken to ensure that all parts Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 75 of 163 are kept together, so that reassembly c an be accomplished efficiently811. Investigators have described the degree of cleanliness by visual and microscopic examination. One study found 91% of the instruments to be clean visually but, when examined microscopically, 84% of the instruments had residual debris. Sites that contained residual debris included junctions between insulating sheaths and activating mechanisms of laparoscopic i nstruments and articulations and grooves of forceps. More research is needed to understand the clinical significance of these findings 960 and how to ensure proper cleaning. Personnel working in the decontamination area should wear household- cleaning -type rubber or plastic gloves when handling or cleaning contaminated instruments and devices. Face masks, eye protection such as goggles or full -length faceshields, and appropriate go wns should be worn when exposure to blood and contaminated fluids may occur (e.g., when manually cleaning contaminated devices)961. Contaminated instruments are a source of microorganisms that could inoculate personnel through nonintact skin on the hands or through contact with the mucous membranes of eyes, nose, or mouth214, 811, 813. Reusable sharps that have been in contact with blood present a special hazard. Employees must not reach with their gloved hands into trays or containers that hold these sharps to retrieve them214. Rather, employees should use engineering controls (e.g., forceps) to retrieve these devices. Packaging. Once items are cleaned, dried, and inspected, those requiring sterilization must be wrapped or placed in rigid containers and should be arranged in instrument trays/baskets according to the guidelines provided by the AAMI and other professional organizations454, 811 -814, 819, 836, 962. These guidelines state that hinged instruments should be opened; items with removable parts should be disassembled unless the device manufacturer or researchers provide specific instructions or test data to the contrary181; complex instruments should be prepared and sterilized according to device manufacturer's instructions and test data; devices with concave surfaces should be positioned to facilitate drainage of water; heavy items should be positioned not to damage delicate items; and the weight of the instrument set should be based on the design and density of the instruments and the distribution of metal mass811, 962. While there is no longer a specified sterilization weight limit for surgical sets, heavy metal mass is a cause of wet packs (i.e., moisture inside the case and tray after completion of the sterilization cycle)963. Other parameters that may influence drying are the density of the wraps and the design of the set964. There are several choices in methods to maintain sterility of surgical instruments, including rigid containers, peel -open pouches (e.g., self -sealed or heat -sealed plastic and paper pouches), roll stock or reels (i.e., paper -plastic combinations of tubing designed to allow the user to cut and seal the ends to form a pouch) 454 and sterilization wraps (woven and nonwoven). Healthcare facilities may use all of these packaging options. The packaging material must allow penetration of the sterilant, provide protection against contact contamination during handling, provide an effective barrier to microbial penetration, and maintain the sterility of the processed item after sterilization 965. An ideal steril ization wrap would successfully address barrier effectiveness, penetrability (i.e., allows sterilant to penetrate), aeration (e.g., allows ETO to dissipate), ease of use, drapeability, flexibility, puncture resistance, tear strength, toxicity, odor, waste disposal, linting, cost, and transparency966. Unacceptable packaging for use with ETO (e.g., foil, polyvinylchloride, and polyvinylidene chlorine [ kitchen -type transparent wrap]) 814 or hydrogen peroxide gas plasma (e.g., linens and paper ) shoul d not be used to wrap medical items. In central processing, double wrapping can be done sequentially or nonsequentially (i.e., simultaneous wrapping). Wrapping should be done in such a manner to avoid tenting and gapping. The sequential wrap uses two sheets of the standard sterilization wrap, one wrapped after the other. This procedure creates a package within a package. The nonsequential process uses two sheets wrapped at the same time so that the wrapping needs to be performed only once. This latter met hod provides multiple layers of protection of surgical instruments from contamination and saves time since wrapping is Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 76 of 163 done only once. Multiple layers are still common practice due to the rigors of handling within the facility even though the barrier effic acy of a single sheet of wr ap has improved over the years966. Written and illustrated procedures for preparation of items to be packaged should be readily available and used by personnel when pack aging procedures are performed454. Loading. All items to be sterilized should be arranged so all surfaces will be directly exposed to the sterilizing agent. Thus, loading procedures must allow for free circulation of steam (or another sterilant) around each item. Historically, it was recommended that muslin fabric packs should not exceed the maximal dimensions, weight, and density of 12 inches wide \u00d7 12 inches high \u00d7 20 inches long, 12 lbs , and 7.2 lbs per cubic foot, respectively. Due to the variety of textiles and metal/plastic containers on the market, the textile and metal/plastic container manufacturer and the sterilizer manufacturers should be consulted for instructions on pack preparation and density parameters819. There are several important basic principles for loading a sterilizer: allow for proper sterilant circulation; perforated trays should be placed so the tray is parallel to the shelf; nonperforated containers should be placed on their edge (e.g., basins); small items should be loosely placed in wire baskets; and peel packs should be placed on edge in perforated or m esh bottom racks or baskets454, 811, 836. Storage. Studies in the early 1970s suggested that wrapped surgical trays remained sterile for varying periods depending on the type of material used to wrap the trays. Safe storage times for sterile packs vary with the porosity of the wrapper and storage conditions (e.g., open versus closed cabinets). Heat -sealed, plastic peel -down pouches and wrapped packs sealed in 3- mil (3/1000 inch) polyethylene overwrap have been reported to be sterile for as long as 9 months after sterilization. The 3- mil polyethyle ne is applied after sterilization to extend the shelf life for infrequently used items967. Supplies wrapped in double- thickness muslin comprising four layers, or equivalent, remain sterile for at least 30 days. Any item that has been sterilized should not be used after the expiration date has been exceeded or if the sterilized package is wet, torn, or punctured. Although some hospitals continue to date every sterilized product and use the time- related shelf -life practice, many hospitals have switched to an event -related shelf -life practice. This latter practice recognizes that t he product should remain sterile until some event causes the item to become contaminated (e.g., tear in packaging, packaging becomes wet, seal is broken)968. Event -related factors that contribute to the contamination of a product include bioburden (i.e., the amount of contamination in the environment), air movement, traffic, location, humidity, insects, vermin, flooding, storage area space, open/closed shelving, tem perature, and the properties of the wrap material966, 969. There are data that support the event -related shelf -life practice970-972. One study examined the effect of time on the sterile integrity of paper envelopes, peel pouches, and nylon sleeves. The most important finding was the absence of a trend toward an increased rate of contamination over time for any pack when placed in covered storage971. Another evaluated the effectiveness of event -related outdating by microbiologically testing sterilized items. During the 2- year study period, all of the items tested were sterile972. Thus, contamination of a sterile item is event -related and the probability of contamination increases with increased handling973. Following the sterilization process, medical and surgical devices must be handled using aseptic technique in order to prevent contamination. Sterile supplies should be stored far enough from the floor (8 to 10 inches), the ceiling (5 inches unless near a sprinkler head [18 inches from sprinkler head] ), and the outside walls (2 inches) to allow for adequate air circulation, ease of cleaning, and compliance with local fire codes (e.g., supplies must be at least 18 inches from sprinkler heads). Medical and surgical supplies should not be stored under sinks or in other locations where they can become wet. Sterile items that become wet are considered contaminated because m oisture brings with it microorganisms from the air and surfaces. Closed or covered cabinets are ideal but open shelving may be used for storage. Any package that has fallen or been dropped on the floor must be inspected for damage to the packaging and contents (if the items are breakable). If the package is heat -sealed in impervious plastic and the seal is Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 77 of 163 still intact, the package should be considered not contaminated. If undamaged, items packaged in plastic need not be reprocessed. Monitoring. The sterilization procedure should be monitored routinely by using a combination of mechanical, chemical, and biological indicators to evaluate the sterilizing conditions and indirectly the microbiologic status of the processed items. The mechanical monitors f or steam sterilization include the daily assessment of cycle time and temperature by examining the temperature record chart (or computer printout) and an assessment of pressure via the pressure gauge. The mechanical monitors for ETO include time, temperature, and pressure recorders that provide data via computer printouts, gauges, and/or displays814. Generally, two essential elements for ETO sterilization (i.e., the gas concentration and humidity) cannot be monitored in healthcare ETO sterilizers. Chemical indicators are convenient, are inexpensive, and indicate that the item has been exposed to the sterilization process. In one study, chemical indicators were more likely than biological indicators to inaccurately indicate sterilization at marginal sterili zation times (e.g., 2 minutes)847. Chemical indicators should be used in conjunction with biological indicators, but based on current studies should not replace them because they indicate sterilization at marginal sterilization time and because only a biological indicator consisting of resistant spores can measure the microbial killing power of the sterilization process.847, 974. Chemical indicators are affixed on the outside of each pack to show that the package has been processed through a sterilization cycle, but these indicators do not prove sterilization has been achieved. Preferably, a chemical indicator also should be plac ed on the inside of each pack to verify sterilant penetration. Chemical indicators usually are either heat -or chemical -sensitive inks that change color when one or more sterilization parameters (e.g., steam -time, temperature, and/or saturated steam; ETO-time, temperature, relative humidity and/or ETO concentration) are present. Chemical indicators have been grouped into five classes based on their ability to monitor one or multiple sterilization parameters813, 819. If the internal and/or external indicator suggests inadequate processing, the item should not be used815. An air -removal test (Bowie- Dick Test) must be performed daily in an empty dynamic -air-removal sterilizer (e.g., prevacuum steam sterilizer ) to ensure air removal . Biological indicators are recognized by most authorities as being closest to the ideal monitors of the sterilization process 974, 975 because they measure the sterilization process directly by using the most resistant microorganisms (i.e., Bacillus spores), and not by merely testing the physical and chemical conditions necessary for sterilizat ion. Since the Bacillus spores used in biological indicators are more resistant and present in greater numbers than are the common microbial contaminants found on patient - care equipment, the demonstration that the biological indicator has been inactivated strongly implies that other potential pathogens in the load have been killed844. An ideal biological monitor of the sterilization process should be easy to use, be inexpensive, not be subject to exogenous contamination, provide positive results as soon as possible after the cycle so that corrective action may be accomplished, and provide positive results only when the sterilization parameters (e.g., steam -time, temperatur e, and/or saturated steam; ETO -time, temperature, relative humidity and/or ETO concentration) are inadequate to kill microbial contaminates847. Biological indicators are the only process indicators that directly monitor the lethality of a given sterilization process. Spores used to monitor a sterilization process have demonstrated resistance to the sterilizing agent and are more resistant than the bioburden found on medical devices179, 911, 912. B. atrophaeus spores (106) are used to monitor ETO and dry heat, and G. stearothermophilus spores (105) are used to monitor steam sterilization, hydrogen peroxide gas plasma, and liquid peracetic acid sterilizers. G. stearothermophilus is incubated at incubated at 35- 37\u00b0C. Steam and low temperature sterilizers (e.g., hydrogen peroxi de gas plasma, peracetic acid) should be monitored at least weekly with the appropriate commercial preparation of spores. If a sterilizer is used frequently (e.g., several loads per day), daily use of biological indicators allows earlier discovery of equipment malfunctions or procedural errors and thus minimizes the extent of patient surveillance and Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 78 of 163 product recall needed in the event of a positive biological indicator811. Each l oad should be monitored if it contains implantable objects. If feasible, implantable items should not be used until the results of spore tests are known to be negative. Originally, spore- strip biological indicators required up to 7 days of incubation to detect viable spores from marginal cycles (i.e., when few spores remained viable). The next generation of biological indicator was self -contained in plastic vials containing a spore- coated paper strip and a growth media in a crushable glass ampoule. This indicator had a maximum incubation of 48 hours but significant failures could be detected in 24 hours. A rapid -readout biological indicator that detects the presence of enzymes of G. stearothermophilus by reading a fluorescent product produced by the enzy matic breakdown of a nonfluorescent substrate has been marketed for the more than 10 years. Studies demonstrate that the sensitivity of rapid- readout tests for steam sterilization (1 hour for 132\u00b0C gravity sterilizers, 3 hrs for 121\u00b0C gravity and 132\u00b0C vacuum sterilizers) parallels that of the conventional sterilization- specific biological indicators 846, 847, 976, 977 and the fluorescent rapid readout results reliably predict 24 - and 48- hour and 7- day growth978. The rapid- readout biological indicator is a dual indicator system as it also detects acid metabolites produc ed during growth of the G. stearothermophilus spores. This system is different from the indicator system consisting of an enzyme system of bacterial origin without spores. Independent comparative data using suboptimal sterilization cycles (e.g., reduced ti me or temperature) with the enzyme -based indicator system have not been published979. A new rapid- readout ETO biological indicator has been designed for rapid and reliable monitoring of ETO sterilization processes. The indicator has been cleared by the FDA for use in the United States400. The rapid- readout ETO biological indicator detects the presence of B. atrophaeus by detecting a fluorescent signal indicating the activity of an enzyme present within the B. atrophaeus organism, beta- glucosidase. The fluorescence indicates the presence of an active spore- associated enzyme and a sterilization process failure. This indicator also detects acid metabolites produced during growth of the B. atrophaeus spore. Per manufacturer's data, the enzyme always was detected whenever viable spores were present. This was expected because the enzyme is relatively ETO resistant and is inactivated at a slightly longer exposure time than the spore. The rapid -readout ETO biological indicator can be used to monitor 100% ETO, and ETO -HCFC mixture sterilization cycles. It has not been tested in ETO -CO 2 mixture sterilization cycles. The standard biological indicator used for monitoring full -cycle steam sterilizers does not provide reliable monitoring flash sterilizers980. Biological indicators specifically designed for monitoring flash sterilization are now available, and studies comparing them have been published846, 847, 981. Since sterilizati on failure can occur (about 1% for steam)982, a procedure to follow in the event of positive spore tests with steam sterilization has been provided by CDC and the Association of periOperative Registered Nurses (AORN). The 1981 CDC recommendation is that \"objects, other than implantable objects, do not need to be recalled because of a single positive spore test unless the steam sterilizer or the sterilization procedure is defective.\" The rationale for this recommendation is that single positive spore tests in sterilizers occur sporadically. They may oc cur for reasons such as slight variation in the resistance of the spores983, improper use of the sterili zer, and laboratory contamination during culture (uncommon with self -contained spore tests). If the mechanical (e.g., time, temperature, pressure in the steam sterilizer) and chemical (internal and/or external) indicators suggest that the sterilizer was functioning properly, a single positive spore test probably does not indicate sterilizer malfunction but the spore test should be repeated immediately 983. If the spore tests remain positive, use of the sterilizer should be discontinued until it is serviced1. Similarly, AORN states that a single positive spore test does not necessarily indicate a sterilizer failure. If the test is positive, the sterilizer should immediately be rechallenged for proper use and function. Items, other than implantable ones, do not necessarily need to be recalled unless a sterilizer malfunction is found. If a sterilizer malfunction is discovered, the items must be considered nonsterile, and the items f rom the suspect load(s) should be recalled, insof ar as possible, and reprocessed 984. A suggested protocol for management of positive biological indicators is shown in Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 79 of 163 Table 12839. A more conservative approach also has been recommended 813 in which any positive spore test is assumed to represent st erilizer malfunction and requires that all materials processed in that sterilizer, dating from the sterilization cycle having the last negative biologic indicator to the next cycle showing satisfactory biologic indicator challenge results, must be consider ed nonsterile and retrieved, if possible, and reprocessed. This more conservative approach should be used for sterilization methods other than steam (e.g., ETO, hydrogen peroxide gas plasma). However, no action is necessary if there is strong evidence for the biological indicator being defective 983 or the growth medium contained a Bacillus contaminant985. If patient -care items were used before retrieval, the infection control professional should assess the risk of infection in collaboration with central processing, surgical services, and risk management staff. The factors that should be considered include the chemical indicator result (e.g., nonreactive chemical indicator may indicate temperature not achieved); the results of other biological indicators that followed the positive biological indicator (e.g., positive on Tuesday, negative on Wednesday); the parameters of the sterilizer associate d with the positive biological indicator (e.g., reduced time at correct temperature); the time- temperature chart (or printout ); and the microbial load associated with decontaminated surgical instruments (e.g., 85% of decontaminated surgical instruments hav e less than 100 CFU). The margin of safety in steam sterilization is sufficiently large that there is minimal infection risk associated with items in a load that show spore growth, especially if the item was properly cleaned and the temperature was achieve d (e.g., as shown by acceptable chemical indicator or temperature chart). There are no published studies that document disease transmission via a nonretrieved surgical instrument following a sterilization cycle with a positive biological indicator. False -positive biological indicators may occur from improper testing or faulty indicators. The latter may occur from i mproper storage, processing, product contamination, material failure, or variation in resistance of spores. Gram stain and subculture of a positive biological indicator may determine if a contaminant has created a false- positive result839, 986. However, in one incident, the broth used as growth medium contained a contaminant, B. coagulans, which res ulted in broth turbidity at 55 \u00b0C985. Testing of paired biological indicator s from different manufacturers can assist in assessing a product defect839. False -positive biological indicators due to extrinsic contamination when using self -contained biological indicators should be uncommon. A biologic al indicator should not be considered a false- positive indicator until a thorough analysis of the entire sterilization process shows this to be likely. The size and composition of the biological indicator test pack should be standardized to create a significant challenge to air removal and sterilant penetration and to obtain interpretable results. There is a standard 16- towel pack recommended by AAMI for steam sterilization 813, 819, 987 consisting of 16 clean, preconditioned, reusable huck or absorbent surgical towels each of which is approximately 16 inches by 26 inches. Each towel is folded lengthwise into thirds and then folded widthwise in the middle. One or more biological indicators are placed between the eight and ninth towels in the approximate geometric center of the pack. When the towels are folded and placed one on top of another, to form a stack (approximately 6 inch height) it should weigh approximately 3 pounds and should have a density of approximately 11.3 pounds per cubic foot813. This test pack has not gained universal use as a standard pack that simulates the actual in- use conditions of steam sterilizers. Commercially available disposable test packs that have been shown to be equivalent to the AAMI 16 towel test pack als o may be used. The test pack should be placed flat in an otherwise fully loaded sterilizer chamber, in the area least favorable to sterilization (i.e., the area representing the greatest challenge to the biological indicator). This area is normally in the front, bottom section of the steriliz er, near the drain811, 813. A control biological indicator from the lot used for testing should be left unexposed to the sterilant, and then incubated to verify the presterilization viability of the test spores and proper incubation. The most conservative approach would be to use a control for each run; however, less frequent use may be adequate (e.g., weekly). There also is a routine t est pack for ETO where a biological indicator is placed in a plastic syringe with plunger, then placed in the folds of a clean surgical towel, and wrapped. Alternatively, commercially available disposal test packs that have been shown to be equivalent to t he AAMI test pack may be used. The test pack is placed in the center of the sterilizer load814. Sterilization records (mechanical, chemical, and biological) Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 80 of 163 should be retained for a time period in compliance with standards (e.g., Joint Commission for the Accreditation of Healthcare Facilities requests 3 years) and state and federal regulations. In Europe, biological monitors are not used routinely to monitor the sterilization process. Instead, release of sterilizer items is based on monitoring the physical conditions of the sterilization process that is termed \"parametric release.\" Parametric release requires that there is a defined quality system in place at the facility performing the sterilization and that the sterilization process be validated for the items being sterilized. At present in Europe, parametric release is accepted for steam, dry heat, and ionizing radiation processes, as the physical conditions are understood and can be monitored directly988. For example, with steam sterilizers the load could be monitored with probes that would yield data on temperature, time, and humidity at representative locations in the chamber and compared to the specifications developed during the validation process. Periodic infection control rounds to areas using sterilizers to standardize the sterilizer's use may identify correctable variances in operator competence; documentation of sterilization records, including chemical and biological indicator test results; sterilizer maintenance and wrapping; and load numbering of packs. These rounds also may identify improvement activities to ensure that operators are adhering to establi shed standards989. Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 81 of 163 Reuse of Single -Use Medical Devices The reuse of single- use medical devices began in the late 1970s. Before this time most devices were considered reusable. Reuse of single- use devices increased as a cost -saving measure. Approximately 20 to 30% of U.S. hospitals reported that they reuse at least one type of single- use device. Reuse of single- use devices involves regulatory, ethical, medical, legal and economic issues and has been extremely controversial for more than two d ecades990. The U.S. public has expressed increasing concern regarding the risk of infection and injury when reusing medical devices intended and labeled for single use. Although some investigators have demonstrated it is safe to reuse disposable medical devices such as cardiac electrode catheters, 991-993 additional studies are needed to define the risks 994 and document the benefits. In August 2000, FDA released a guidance document on single -use devices reprocessed by third parties or hospitals995. In this guidance document, FDA states that hospitals or third- party reprocessors will be considered \"manufacturers\" and regulated in the same manner. A reused single- use device will have to comply with the same regulatory requirements of the device when it was originally manufactured. This document presents FDA's intent to enforce premarket submission requirements within 6 months (February 2001) for class III devices (e.g., cardiovascular intra- aortic balloon pump, transluminal coronary angioplasty catheter); 12 months (August 2001) for class II devices (e.g., blood pressure cuff, bronchoscope biopsy forceps); and 18 months (February 2002) for class I devices (e.g., disposable medical scissors, ophthalmic knife). FDA uses two types of premarket requirements for nonexempt class I and II devices, a 510(k) submission that may have to show that the device is as safe and effective as the same device when new, and a premarket approval application. The 510(k) submission must provide scientific evidence that the device is safe and effective for its intended use. FDA allowed hospitals a year to comply wit h the nonpremarket requirements (registration and listing, reporting adverse events associated with medical devices, quality system regulations, and proper labeling). The options for hospitals are to stop reprocessing single- use devices, comply with the rule, or outsource to a third- party reprocessor. FDA guidance document does not apply to permanently implantable pacemakers, hemodialyzers, opened but unused single- use devices, or healthcare settings other than acute- care hospitals. The reuse of single use medical devices continues to be an evolving area of regulations. For this reason, healthcare workers should refer to FDA (http://www.fda.gov/ ) for the latest guidance 996. Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 82 of 163 Conclusion When properly used, disinfection and sterilization can ensur e the safe use of invasive and non- invasive medical devices. However, current disinfection and sterilization guidelines must be strictly followed. Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 83 of 163 Web -Based Disinfection and Sterilization Resources Additional information about disinfection and sterilization is available at the following dedicated websites: Food and Drug Administration, Rockville, Maryland [This link is no longer active: http://www.fda.gov/dcrh/ode/germlab.html.] Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, D.C Selected EPA -registered Disinfectants (https://www.epa.gov/pesticide -registration/selected- epa- registered- disinfectants ) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia Healthcare- associated Infections (HAI) (https://www.cdc.gov/HAI/index.html ) University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina Disinfection and Sterilization (http://www.disinfectionandsterilization.org ) Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 84 of 163 Recommendations for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities A. Rationale The ultimate goal of the Recommendations for Disinfection and Sterilization in Health- Care Facilities, 2008, is to reduce rates of health- care associated infections through appropriate use of both disinfection and sterilization. Each recommendation is categorized according to scientific evidence, theoretical rationale, applicability, and federal regulations. Examples are included in some recommendations to aid the rea der; however, these examples are not intended to define the only method of implementing the recommendation. The CDC system for categorizing recommendations is defined in the following (Rankings) section. B. Rankings Category IA . Strongly recommended for implementation and strongly supported by well -designed experimental, clinical, or epidemiologic studies. Category IB . Strongly recommended for implementation and supported by some experimental, clinical, or epidemiologic studies, and by a strong theoretica l rationale. Category IC. Required by state or federal regulations. Because of state differences, readers should not assume that the absence of an IC recommendation implies the absence of state regulations. Category II . Suggested for implementation and sup ported by suggestive clinical or epidemiologic studies or by a theoretical rationale. No recommendation . Unresolved issue. These include practices for which insufficient evidence or no consensus exists regarding efficacy. New Categorization Scheme for Updated Recommendations [November 2018] In November 2018, HICPAC voted to approve an updated recommendation scheme. The category Recommendation means that we are confident that the benefits of the recommended approach clearly exceed the harms (or, in the c ase of a negative recommendation, that the harms clearly exceed the benefits). In general, Recommendations should be supported by high- to moderate- quality evidence. In some circumstances, however, Recommendations may be made based on lesser evidence or ev en expert opinion when high- quality evidence is impossible to obtain and the anticipated benefits strongly outweigh the harms or when then Recommendation is required by federal law. This new categorization scheme applies to recommendations made after November 2018. For more information, see November 2018 HICPAC Meeting Minutes [PDF - 126 pages] (https://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/pdf/2018- Nov-HICPAC -Meeting- 508.pdf) . C. Recommendations 1. Occupational Health and Exposure a. Inform each worker of the possible health effects of his or her exposure to infectious agents (e.g., hepatitis B virus [HBV], hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]), and/or chemicals (e.g., EtO, formaldehyde). The information should be consistent with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requirements and identify the areas and tasks in which potential exists for exposure. Category II, IC214, 320, 959, 997, 998 b. Educate health- care workers in the selection and proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Category II, IC c. Ensure that workers wear appropr iate PPE to preclude exposure to infectious agents or chemicals through the respiratory system, skin, or mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, or mouth. PPE can Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 85 of 163 include gloves, gowns, masks, and eye protection. The exact type of PPE depends on the infectious or chemical agent and the anticipated duration of exposure. The employer is responsible for making such equipment and training available. Category II, IC . 214, 997- 999 d. Establish a program for monitoring occupational exposure to regulated chemicals (e.g., formaldehyde, EtO) that adheres to state and federal regulations. Category II, IC . 997, 1000, 1001 e. Exclude healthcare workers with weeping dermatitis of hands from direct contact with patient - care equipment. Category IB . 1002, 1003 2. Cleaning of Patient -Care Devices a. In hospitals, perform most cleaning, disinfection, and sterilization of patient -care devices in a central processing department in order to more easily control quality. Category II . 454, 836, 959 b. Meticulous ly clean patient -care items with water and detergent, or with water and enzymatic cleaners before high- level disinfection or sterilization procedures. Category IB. 6, 83, 101, 104 -106, 124, 179, 424-426, 436, 465, 471, 911 -913, 1004 i. Remove visible organic residue (e.g., residue of blood and tissue) and inorganic salts with cleaning. Use cleaning agents that are capable of removing visible organic and inorganic residues. Category IB. 424-426, 466, 468, 469, 471, 908, 910 ii. Clean medical devices as soon as practical after use (e.g., at the point of use) because soiled materials become dried onto the instruments. Dried or baked materials on the instrument make the removal process more difficult and the disinfection or sterilization process less effective or ineffective. Category IB. 55, 56, 59, 291, 465, 1005, 1006 c. Perform either manual cleaning (i.e., using friction) or mechanical cleaning (e.g., with ultrasonic cleaners, washer -disinfector, washer -sterilizers). Category IB . 426, 456, 471, 999 d. If using an automatic washer/disinf ector, ensure that the unit is used in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. Category IB . 7, 133, 155, 725 e. Ensure that the detergents or enzymatic cleaners selected are compatible with the metals and other materials used in medical instruments. Ensure that the rinse s tep is adequate for removing cleaning residues to levels that will not interfere with subsequent disinfection/sterilization processes. Category II . 836, 1004 f. Inspect equipment surfaces for breaks in integrity that would impair either cleaning or disinfection/sterilization. Discard or repair equipment that no longer functions as intended or cannot be properly cleaned, and disinfected or sterilized. Category II . 888 3. Indications for Sterilization, High- Level Disinfection, and Low -Level Disinfection a. Before use on each patient, sterilize critical medical and surgical devices and instruments that enter normally sterile tissue or the vascular system or through which a sterile body fluid flows (e.g., blood). See recommendation 7g for exceptions. Category IA . 179, 497, 821, 822, 907, 911, 912 b. Provide, at a minimum, high- level disinfection for semicritical patient -care equipment (e.g., gastrointestinal endoscopes, endotracheal tubes, anesthesia breathing circuits, and respiratory therapy equipment) that touches either mucous membranes or nonintact skin. Category IA . 6-8, 17, 20, 99, 101, 108, 113 -115, 129, 138, 139, 147, 152-154, 4 71, 1007 c. Perform low -level disinfection for noncritical patient -care surfaces (e.g., bedrails, over -the-bed table) and equipment (e.g., blood pressure cuff) that touch intact skin (see Recommendation 5g). Category II . 17, 46-48, 50 -52, 67, 68, 372, 373, 378, 382, 401 4. Selection and Use of Low -Level Disinfectants for Noncritical Patient -Care Devices a.

Use protective gloves and other PPE (e.g., when sharps are involved use forceps to pick up sharps, and discard these items in a puncture- resistant container) appropriate for this task. Disinfect areas contaminated with b lood spills using an EPA - registered tuberculocidal agent, a registered germicide on the EPA Lists D and E (i.e., products with specific label claims for HIV or HBV or freshly diluted hypochlorite solution. Category II, IC . 214, 215, 557, 1013 1. * If sodium hypochlorite solutions are selected use a 1:100 dilution (e.g., 525- 615 ppm available chlorine) to decontaminate nonporous surfaces after a small spill (e.g., <10 m L) of either blood or OPIM. If a spill involves large amounts (e.g., >10 m L) of blood or OPIM, or involves a culture spill in the laboratory, use a 1:10 dilution for the first application of hypochlorite solution before clea ning in order to reduce the risk of infection during the cleaning process in the event of a sharp injury.

C. difficile Update [ May 2019]: This recommendation was updated to reflect changes in Federal regulatory approvals: LIST K: EPA's Registered sporicidal disinfectant for environmental disinfection in units with high rates of endemic Clostridium difficile infection or in an outbreak setting. New Categorization Scheme: Recommendation \" See \"New Categorization Scheme for Recommendations\" on page 83. r. In units with high rates of endemic Clostridium difficile infection or in an outbreak setting, use dilute solutions of 5.25% -6.15% sodium hypochlorite (e.g., 1:10 dilution of household bleach) for routine environmental disinfection. Currently, no products are EPA -registered specifically for inactivating C. difficile spores . Category II . 257-259 s. If chlorine solution is not prepared fresh daily, it can be stored at room temperature for up to 30 days in a capped, opaque plastic bottle with a 50% reduction in chlorine concentration after 30 days of storage (e.g., 1000 ppm chlorine [approximately a 1:50 dilution] at day 0 decreases to 500 ppm chlorine by day 30). Category IB . 327, 1014 t. An EPA- registered sodium hypochlorite product is preferred, but if such products are not available, generic versions of sodi um hypochlorite solutions (e.g., household chlorine bleach) can be used. Category II. 44 6. Disinfectant Fogging a. Do not perform disinfectant fogging for routine purposes in patient -care areas. Category II . 23, 228 Environmental Fogging Clarification Statement [December 2009] : CDC and HICPAC have recommendations in the 2008 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities that Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 88 of 163 state that the CDC does not support disinfectant fogging. These recommendations refer to the spraying or fogging of chemicals (e.g., formaldehyde, phenol - based agents, or quaternary ammonium compounds) as a way to decontaminate environmental surfaces or disinfect the air in patient rooms. The recommendation against fogging was based on studies in the 1970's that reported a lack of microbicidal efficacy (e.g., use of quaternary ammonium compounds in mist applications) but also adverse effects on healthcare workers and others in facilities where these methods were utilized. Furthermore, some of these chemicals are not EPA -registered for use in fogging- type applications. These recommendations do not apply to newer technologies involving fogging for room decontamination (e.g., ozone mists, vaporized hydrogen peroxide) that have become available since the 2008 recommendations were made. These newer technologies were assessed by CDC and HICPAC in the 2011 Guideline for the Prevention and Control of Norovirus Gastroenteritis Outbreaks in Healthcare Settings, which makes the recommendation: \"More research is required to clarify the effectiveness and reliability of fogging, UV irradiation, and ozone mists to reduce norovirus environmental contamination. (No rec ommendation/ unresolved issue)\" The 2008 recommendations still apply; however, CDC does not yet make a recommendation regarding these newer technologies. This issue will be revisited as additional evidence becomes available. 7. High -Level Disinfection of Endoscopes a. To detect damaged endoscopes, test each flexible endoscope for leaks as part of each reprocessing cycle. Remove from clinical use any instrument that fails the leak test, and repair this instrument. Category II . 113, 115, 116 b. Immediately after use, meticulously clean the endoscope with an enzymatic clean er that is compatible with the endoscope. Cleaning is necessary before both automated and manual disinfection. Category IA . 83, 101, 104 -106, 113, 115, 116, 124, 126, 456, 465, 466, 471, 1015 c. Disconnect and disassemble endoscopic components (e.g., suction valves) as completely as possible and completely immerse all components in the enzymatic cleaner. Steam sterilize these components if they are heat stable. Category IB . 115, 116, 139, 465, 466 d. Flush and brush all accessible channels to remove all organic (e.g., blood, tissue) and other residue. Clean the external surfaces and accessories of the devices by using a soft cloth or sponge or brushes. Continue brushing until no debris appears on t he brush. Category IA 6, 17, 108, 113, 115, 116, 137, 145, 147, 725, 856, 903. e. Use cleaning brus hes appropriate for the size of the endoscope channel or port (e.g., bristles should contact surfaces). Cleaning items (e.g., brushes, cloth) should be disposable or, if they are not disposable, they should be thoroughly cleaned and either high-level disin fected or sterilized after each use. Category II . 113, 115, 116, 1016 f. Discard enzymatic cleaners (or detergents) after each use because they are not microbicidal a nd, therefore, will not retard microbial growth. Category IB . 38, 113, 115, 116, 466 g. Process endoscopes (e.g., arthroscopes, cystoscope, laparoscopes) that pass through normally sterile tissues using a sterilization procedure before each use; if this is not feasible, provide at least high- level disinfection. High -level disinfection of arthroscopes, laparoscopes, and cystoscopes should be followed by a sterile water rinse. Category IB . 1, 17, 31, 32, 35, 89, 90, 113, 554 h. Phase out endoscopes that are critical items (e.g., arthroscopes, laparoscopes) but cannot be steam sterilized. Replace these endoscopes with steam sterilizable instruments when feasible. Category II . i. Mechanically clean reusable accessories inserted into endoscopes (e.g., biopsy forceps or other cutting instruments) that break the mucosal barrier ( e.g., ultrasonically clean biopsy forceps) and then sterilize these items between each patient. Category IA . 1, 6, 8, 17, 108, 113, 115, 116, 138, 145, 147, 153, 278 j. Use ultrasonic cleaning of reusable endoscopic accessories to remove soil and organic material from hard- to-clean areas.

Process endoscopes and accessories that contact mucous membranes as semicritical items, and use at least high- level disinfection after use on each patient. Category IA . 1, 6, 8, 17, 108, 113, 115, 116, 129, 138, 145-148, 152-154, 278 l. Use an FDA -cleared sterilant or high- level disinfectant for sterilization or high- level disinfection (Table 1). Category IA . 1, 6-8, 17, 85, 108, 113, 115, 116, 147 m. After cleaning, use formulations containing glutaraldehyde, glutaraldehyde with phenol/phenate, ortho- phthalaldehyde, hydrog en peroxide, and both hydrogen peroxide and peracetic acid to achieve high- level disinfection followed by rinsing and drying (see Table 1 for recommended concentrations). Category IB . 1, 6-8, 17, 38, 85, 108, 113, 145 -148 n. Extend exposure times beyond the minimum effective time for disinfecting semicritical patient -care equipment cautiously and conservatively because extended exposure to a high- level disinfectant is more likely to damage delicate and intricate instruments such as flexible endoscopes. The exposure times vary among the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -cleared high- level disinfectants (Table 2). Category IB . 17, 69, 73, 76, 78, 83 o. Federal regulations are to follow the FDA-cleared label claim for high- level disinfectants. The FDA - cleared labels for high- level disinfection with >2% glutaraldehyde at 25\u00b0C range from 20- 90 minutes, depending upon the product based on three tier testing which includes AOAC sporicidal tests, simulated use testing with mycobacteria l and in- use testing. Category IC . p. Several scientific studies and professional organizations support the efficacy of >2% glutaraldehyde for 20 minutes at 20\u00baC; that efficacy assumes adequate cleaning prior to disinfection, whereas the FDA -cleared label claim incorporates an added margin of safety to accommodate possible lapses in cleaning practices. Facilities that have chosen to apply the 20 minute duration at 20\u00baC have done so based on the IA recommendation in the July 2003 SHEA position paper, \"Multi -society Guideline for Reprocessing Flexible Gastrointestinal Endoscopes .\" 12, 17, 19, 26, 27, 49, 55, 57, 58, 60, 73, 76, 79 -81, 83 -85, 93, 94, 104 -106, 110, 111, 115 -121, 124, 125, 233, 235, 236, 243, 265, 266, 609 Update [June 2011] : Multisociety guideline on FDA -cleared high- level disinfectants, use manufacturers' r ecommended exposure conditions. Certain products may require a shorter exposure time (e.g., 0.55% ortho -phthalaldehyde for 12 minutes at 20\u00b0C , 7.35% hydrogen peroxide plus 0.23% peracetic acid for 15 minutes at 20 \u00b0C) than glutaraldehyde at room temperature because of their rapid inactivation of mycobacteria or reduced exposure time because of increased mycobactericidal activity at elevated temperature (e.g., 2.5% glutaraldehyde at 5 minutes at 35 \u00b0C). Category IB . 83, 100, 689, 693, 694, 700 r. Select a disinfectant or chemical sterilant that is compatible with the device that is being reprocessed. Avoid using reprocessing chemicals on an endoscope if the endoscope manufacturer warns against using these chemicals because of functional damage (with or without cosmetic damage). Category IB . 69, 113, 116 s. Completely immerse the endoscope i n the high- level disinfectant , and ensure all channels are perfused. As soon as is feasible, phase out nonimmersible endoscopes. Category IB . 108, 113 -116, 137, 725, 856, 882 t. After high- level disinfection, rinse endoscopes and flush channels with sterile water, filtered water, or tapwater to prevent adverse effects on patients associated with disinf ectant retained in the endoscope (e.g., disinfectant induced colitis). Follow this water rinse with a rinse with 70% - 90% ethyl or isopropyl alcohol. Category I B. 17, 31-35, 38, 39, 108, 113, 115, 116, 134, 145- 148, 620-622, 624-630, 1017 u. After flushing all channels with alcohol, purge the channels using forced air to reduce the likelihood of contamination of the endoscope by waterborne pathogens and to facilitate drying.

Do not use packaging materials and containers in flash sterilization cycles unless the sterilizer and the packaging material/container are designed for this use. Category IB . 812, 819, 1025 e. When necessary, use flash sterilization for patient -care items that will be used immediately (e.g., to reprocess an inadvertently dropped instrument). Category IB . 812, 817, 819, 845 f. When necessary, use flash sterilization for processing patient -care items that cannot be packaged, sterili zed, and stored before use. Category IB . 812, 819 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 93 of 163 14. Methods of Sterilization a. Steam is the preferred method for sterilizing critical medical and surgical instruments that are not damaged by heat, steam, pressure, or moisture. Category IA . 181, 271, 425, 426, 827, 841, 1026, 1027 b. Cool steam - or heat -sterilized items before they are handled or used in the operative setting. Category IB . 850 c. Follow the sterilization times, temperatures, and other operat ing parameters (e.g., gas concentration, humidity) recommended by the manufacturers of the instruments, the sterilizer, and the container or wrap used, and that are consistent with guidelines published by government agencies and professional organizations. Category IB . 811-814, 819, 825, 827, 84 1, 1026 -1028 d. Use low -temperature sterilization technologies (e.g., EtO , hydrogen peroxide gas plasma) for reprocessing critical patient -care equipment that is heat or moisture sensitive. Category IA 469, 721, 825, 856, 858, 878, 879, 881, 882, 890, 891, 1027. e. Completely aerate surgical and medical items that have been sterilized in the E tO sterilizer (e.g., polyvinylchloride tubing requires 12 hours at 50\u00b0C , 8 hours at 60\u00b0C ) before using these items in patient care. Category IB . 814 f. Sterilization using the peracetic acid immersion system can be used to sterilize heat -sensitive immersible medical and surgical items. Category IB . 90, 717-719, 721 -724 g. Critical items that have been sterilized by the peracetic acid immersion process must be used immediat ely (i.e., items are not completely protected from contamination, making long- term storage unacceptable). Category II . 817, 825 h. Dry-heat sterilization (e.g., 340\u00b0F for 60 minutes) can be used to sterilize items (e.g., powders, oils) that can sustain high temperatures. Category IB . 815, 827 i. Comply with the sterilizer manufact urer's instructions regarding the sterilizer cycle parameters (e.g., time, temperature, concentration). Category IB . 155, 725, 811 -814, 819 j. Because narrow -lumen devices provide a challenge to all low -temperature sterilization technologies and direct contact is necessary for the sterilant to be effective, ensure that the sterilant has direct contact with contaminated surfaces (e.g., scopes processed in peracetic acid must be conn ected to channel irrigators). Category IB . 137, 725, 825, 856, 890, 891, 1029 15. Packaging a. Ensure that packaging materials are compatible with the sterilization process and have received FDA 510[k] clearance. Category IB . 811-814, 819, 966 b. Ensure that packaging is sufficiently strong to res ist punctures and tears to provide a barrier to microorganisms and moisture. Category IB. 454, 811 -814, 819, 966 16. Monitoring of Sterilizers a. Use mechanical, chemical, and biologic monitors to ensure the effectiveness of the sterilization process. Category IB . 811-815, 819, 846, 847, 975 -977 b. Monitor each load with mechanical (e.g., time, temperature, pressure) and chemical (internal and external) indicators. If the internal chemical indicator is visible, an external indicator is not needed. Category II . 811-815, 819, 846, 847, 975 -977, 980 c. Do not use processed items if the mechanical (e.g., time, temperature, pressure) or chemical (internal and/or external) indicators suggest inadequate processing. Category IB 811-814, 819. d. Use biologic indicators to monitor the effectiveness of sterilizers at least weekly with an FDA - cleared commerc ial preparation of spores (e.g., Geobacillus stearothermophilus for steam) intended specifically for the type and cycle parameters of the sterilizer. Category IB . 1, 811, 813 -815, 819, 846, 847, 976, 977 e. After a single positive biologic indicator used with a method other than steam sterilization, treat as nonsterile all items that have been processed in that sterilizer, dating from the sterilization cycle having the last negative biologic indicator to the next cycle showing satisfactory biologic indicator results. These nonsterile items should be retrieved if possible and reprocessed. Category II . 1 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 94 of 163 f. After a positive biologic indicator with steam sterilization, objects other than implantable objects do not need to be recalled because of a single positive spore test unless the s terilizer or the sterilization procedure is defective as determined by maintenance personnel or inappropriate cycle settings. If additional spore tests remain positive, consider the items nonsterile and recall and reprocess the items from the implicated load(s) . Category II. 1 g. Use biologic indicators for every load containing implantable items and quarantine items, whenever possible, until the biologic indicator is negative. Category IB . 811-814, 819 17. Load Configuration. a. Place items correctly and loosely into the basket, shelf, or cart of the sterilizer so as not to impede the pe netration of the sterilant. Category IB . 445, 454, 811, 813, 819, 836 18. Storage of Sterile Items a. Ensure the sterile storage area is a well -ventilated area that provides protection against dust, moisture, insects, and temperature and humidity extremes. Category II . 454, 819, 836, 969 b. Store sterile item s so the packaging is not compromised (e.g., punctured, bent). Category II . 454, 816, 819, 968, 969, 1030 c. Label sterilized items with a load number that indicates the sterilizer used, the cycle or load number, the date of sterilization, and, if applicable, the expiration date. Category IB . 811, 812, 814, 816, 819 d. The shelf life of a packaged sterile item depends on the quality of the wrapper, the storage conditions, the conditions during transport, the amount of handling, and other eve nts (moisture) that compromise the integrity of the package. If event -related storage of sterile items is used, then packaged sterile items can be used indefinitely unless the packaging is compromised (see f and g below). Category IB . 816, 819, 836, 968, 973, 1030, 1031 e. Evaluate packages before use for loss of integrity (e.g., torn, wet, punctured). The pack can be used unless the integrity of the packaging is compromised. Category II. 819, 968 f. If the integrity of the packaging is compromised (e.g., torn, wet, or punctured), repack and reprocess the pack before use. Category II . 819, 1032 g. If time -related storage of sterile items is used, label the pack at the time of sterilization with an expiration date. Once this date expires, reprocess the pack. Category II . 819, 968 19. Quality Control a. Provide comprehensive and intensive training for all staff assigned to reprocess semicritical and critical medical/surgical instruments to ensure they understand the importance of reprocessing these instruments. To achieve and maintain competency, train each member of the staff that reprocesses semicritical and/or critical instruments as follows: 1. provide hands -on training according to the institutional policy for reprocessing critical and semicritical devices; 2. supervise all work until competency is documented for each reprocessing task; 3. conduct competency testing at beginning of employment and regularly thereafter (e.g., annually); and 4. review the written reprocessing instructions regularly to ensure they comply with the scientific literature and the manufacturers' instructions. Category IB. 6-8, 108, 114, 129, 155, 725, 813, 819 b. Compare the reprocessing instructions (e.g., for the appropriate use of endoscope connectors, the capping/noncapping of specific lumens) provided by the instrument manufacturer and the sterilizer manufacturer and resolve any conflicting recommendations by communicating with both manufacturers. Category IB . 155, 725 c. Conduct infection control rounds periodically (e.g., annually) in high- risk reprocessing ar eas (e.g., the Gastroenterology Clinic, Central Processing) ; ensure reprocessing instructions are current and accurate and are correctly implemented. Document all deviations from policy. All stakeholders should identify what corrective actions will be impl emented. Category IB. 6-8, 129 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 95 of 163 d. Include the following in a quality control program for sterilized items: a sterilizer maintenance contract with records of service; a system of process monitoring; air -removal testing for prevacuum steam sterilizers; visual inspection of packaging materials; and traceability of load contents. Category II 811-814, 819. e. For each sterilization cycle, record the type of sterilizer and cycle used; the load identification number; the load contents; the exposure parameters (e.g., time and temperature); the operator's name or initials; and the results of mechanical, chemical, and biological monitoring. Category II 811-814, 819. f. Retain sterilization records (mechanical, chemical, and biological) for a time period that complies with standards (e.g., 3 years), statutes of limitations, and state and federal regulations. Category II, IC . 1033 g. Prepare and package items to be sterilized so that sterility can be achieved and maintained to the point of use. Consult the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation or the manufacturers of surgical instruments, sterilizers, and container systems for guidelines for the density of wrapped packages. Category II . 811-814, 819 h. Periodically review policies and procedures for sterilization. Category II . 1033 i. Perform preventive maintenance on sterilizers by qualified personnel who are guided by the manufacturer's instruction. Category II. 811-814, 819 20. Reuse of Single -Use Medical Devices a. Adhere to the FDA enforcement document for single- use devices reprocessed by hospitals. FDA considers the hospital that reprocesses a single- use device as the manufacturer of the device and regulates the hospital using the same standards by which it regulates the original equipment manufacturer. Category II, IC . 995 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 96 of 163 Performance Indicators 1. Monitor adherence to high- level disinfection and/or sterilization guidel ines for endoscopes on a regular basis. This monitoring should include ensuring the proper training of persons performing reprocessing and their adherence to all endoscope reprocessing steps, as demonstrated by competency testing at commencement of employm ent and annually. 2. Develop a mechanism for the occupational health service to report all adverse health events potentially resulting from exposure to disinfectants and sterilants; review such exposures; and implement engineering, work practice, and PPE to prevent future exposures. 3. Monitor possible sterilization failures that resulted in instrument recall. Assess whether additional training of personnel or equipment maintenance is required.

Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 98 of 163 Glossary Action level : concentration of a regulated substance (e.g., ethylene oxide, formaldehyde) within the employee breathing zone, above which OSHA requirements apply. Activation of a sterilant: process of mixing the contents of a chemical sterilant that come in two containers (small vial with the activator solution; container of the c hemical) . Keeping the two chemicals separate until use extends the shelf life of the chemicals. Aeration : method by which ethylene oxide (EtO) is removed from EtO -sterilized items by warm air circulation in an enclosed cabinet specifically designed for thi s purpose. Antimicrobial agent: any agent that kills or suppresses the growth of microorganisms. Antiseptic : substance that prevents or arrests the growth or action of microorganisms by inhibiting their activity or by destroying them. The term is used especially for preparations applied topically to living tissue. Asepsis: prevention of contact with microorganisms. Autoclave: device that sterilizes instruments or other objects using steam under pressure. The length of time required for sterilization depends on temperature, vacuum, and pressure. Bacterial count : method of estimating the number of bacteria per unit sample. The term also refers to the estimated number of bacteria per unit sample, usually expressed as number of colony -forming units. Bactericide: agent that kills bacteria. Bioburden : number and types of viable microorganisms with which an item is contaminated; also called bioload or microbial load . Biofilm : accumulated mass of bacteria and extracellular material that is tightly adhered to a surface and cannot be easily removed. Biologic indicator : device for monitoring the sterilization process. The device consists of a standardized, viable population of microorganisms (usually bacterial spores) known to be resistant to the sterilization process being monitored. Biologic indicators are intended to demonstrate whether conditions were adequate to achieve sterilization. A negative biologic indicator does not prove that all items in the load are sterile or that they were all exposed to adequate sterili zation conditions. Bleach : Household bleach ( that includes 5.25% or 6.00% -6.15% sodium hypochlorite depending on manufacturer) is usually diluted in water at 1:10 or 1:100. Approximate dilutions are 1.5 cups of bleach in a gallon of water for a 1:10 dilution (~6,000 ppm) and 0.25 cup of bleach in a gallon of water for a 1:100 dilution (~600 ppm). Sodium hypochlorite products that make pesticidal claims, such as sanitization or disinfection, must be registered by EPA and be labeled with an EPA Registration Number.

Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 99 of 163 Bowie -Dick test : diagnostic test of a sterilizer's ability to remove air from the chamber of a prevacuum steam sterilizer. The air -removal or Bowie- Dick test is not a test for sterilization. Ceiling limit : concentration of an airborne chemical contaminant that should not be exceeded during any part of the workday. If instantaneous monitoring is not feasible, the ceiling must be assessed as a 15- minute time- weighted average exposure. Centigrade or Celsius: a temperature scale (0\u00b0C = freezing point of water; 100\u00b0C = boiling point of water at sea level). Equivalents mentioned in the g uideline are as follows: formula is: F\u00b0 = (C\u00b0 \u00d7 9 5) + 32 or C\u00b0 = (F\u00b0 - 32) \u00d7 5 9. Central processing or Central service department : the department within a health- care facility that processes, issues, and controls professional supplies and equipment, both sterile and nonsterile, for some or all patient -care areas of the facility. Challenge test pack: pack used in installation, qualification, and ongoing quality assurance testing of health- care facility sterilizers. Chemical indicator : device for monitoring a sterilization process. The device is designed to respond with a characteristic chemical or physical change to one or more of the physical condi tions within the sterilizing chamber. Chemical indicators are intended to detect potential sterili zation failures that could result from incorrect packaging, incorrect loading of the sterilizer, or malfunctions of the sterilizer. The \"pass\" response of a chemical indicator does not prove the item accompanied by the indicator is necessarily sterile. The Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation has defined five classes of chemical indicators: Class 1 (process indicator); Class 2 (Bowie- Dick te st indicator); Class 3 (single - parameter indicator); Class 4 (multi -parameter indicator); and Class 5 (integrating indicator). Contact time : time a disinfectant is in direct contact with the surface or item to be disinfected . For surface disinfection, thi s period is framed by the application to the surface until complete drying has occurred. Container system, rigid container : sterilization containment device designed to hold medical devices for sterilization, storage, transportation, and aseptic presentat ion of contents. Contaminated : state of having actual or potential contact with microorganisms. As used in health care, the term generally refers to the presence of microorganisms that could produce disease or infection. Control, positive : biologic indicator, from the same lot as a test biologic indicator, that is left unexposed to the sterilization cycle and then incubated to verify the viability of the test biologic indicator. Cleaning : removal, usually with detergent and water or enzyme cleaner and water, of adherent visible soil, blood, protein substances, microorganisms and other debris from the surfaces, crevices, serrations, joints, and lumens of instruments, devices, and equipment by a manual or mechanical process that prepares the items for safe handling and/or further decontamination. Culture : growth of microorganisms in or on a nutrient medium; to grow microorganisms in or on such a medium. Culture medium : substance or preparation used to grow and cultivate microorganisms.

In health- care facilities, the term generally refers to all pathogenic organisms. Decontamination area : area of a health- care facility designated for collection, retention, and cleaning of soiled and/or contaminated items. Detergent : cleaning agent that makes no antimicrobial claims on the label. They comprise a hydrophilic component and a lipohilic component and can be divided into four types: anionic, cationic, amphoteric, and non- ionic detergents. Disinfectant : usually a chemical agent (but sometimes a physical agent) that destroys disease- causing pathogens or other harmful microorganisms but might not kill bacterial spores. It refers to substances applied to inanimate objec ts. EPA groups disinfectants by product label claims of \"limited,\" \"general,\" or \"hospital\" disinfection. Disinfection : thermal or chemical destruction of pathogenic and other types of microorganisms. Disinfection is less lethal than sterilization because it destroys most recognized pathogenic microorganisms but not necessarily all microbial forms (e.g., bacterial spores). D value: time or radiation dose required to inactivate 90% of a population of the test microorganism under stated exposure conditions. Endoscope : an instrument that allows examination and treatment of the interior of the body canals and hollow organs.

No. : a hyphenated, two - or three- part number assigned by EPA to identify each germicidal product registered within the United States. The first number is the company identification number, the second is the specific product number, and the third (when present) is the company identification number for a supplemental registrant. Exposure time : period in a sterilization process during which items are exposed to the sterilant at the specified sterilization p arameters. For example, in a steam sterilization process, exposure time is the period during which items are exposed to saturated steam at the specified temperature. Flash sterilization : process designed for the steam sterilization of unwrapped patient -care items for immediate use (or placed in a specially designed, covered, rigid container to allow for rapid penetration of steam). Fungicide : agent that destroys fungi (including yeasts) and/or fungal spores pathogenic to humans or other animals in the inanimate environment.

Inanimate surface: nonliving surface (e.g., floors, walls, furniture). Incubator : apparatus for maintaining a constant and suitable temperature for the growth and cultivation of microorganisms. Infectious microorganisms : microorganisms capable of producing disease in appropriate hosts. Inorganic and organic load : naturally occurring or artificially placed inorganic (e.g., metal salts) or organic (e.g., proteins) contaminants on a medic al device before exposure to a microbicidal process. Intermediate- level disinfectant : agent that destroys all vegetative bacteria, including tubercle bacilli, lipid and some nonlipid viruses, and fungi, but not bacterial spores. Limited disinfectant: dis infectant registered for use against a specific major group of organisms (gram - negative or gram -positive bacteria). Efficacy has been demonstrated in laboratory tests against either Salmonella choleraesuis or Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. Lipid virus : virus surrounded by an envelope of lipoprotein in addition to the usual core of nucleic acid surrounded by a coat of protein. This type of virus (e.g., HIV) is generally easily inactivated by many types of disinfectants. Also called enveloped or lipophilic virus . Low-level disinfectant : agent that destroys all vegetative bacteria (except tubercle bacilli), lipid viruses, some nonlipid viruses, and some fungi, but not bacterial spores. Mechanical indicator : devices that monitor the sterilization process (e.g., graphs, gauges, printouts). Medical device: instrument, apparatus, material, or other article, whether used alone or in combination, including software necessary for its application, intended by the manufacturer to be used for human beings for diagnosis, prevention, monitoring treatment, or alleviation of disease; diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, or alleviation of or compensation for an injury or handicap; investigation, replacement, or modification of the anatomy or of a physiologic process; or control of conception and that does not achieve its primary intended action in or on the human body by pharmacologic, immunologic, or metabolic means but might be assisted in its function by such means. Microbicide : any substance or mixture of substances that effectively kills microorganisms. Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 102 of 163 Microorganisms : animals or plants of microscopic size. As used in health care, generally refers to bacteria, fungi, viruses, and bacterial spores. Minimum effective concentration (MEC): the minimum concentration of a liquid chemical germicide needed to achieve the claimed microbicidal activity as determined by dose- response testing. Sometimes used interchangeably with minimum recommended concentration. Muslin : loosely woven (by convention, 140 threads per square inch), 100% cotton cloth. Formerly used as a wrap for sterile packs or a surgical drape. Fabric wraps used currently consist of a cotton- polyester blend. Mycobacteria: bacteria with a thick, waxy coat that makes them more resistant to chemical germicides than other types of vegetative bacteria. Nonlipid viruses : generally considered more resistant to inactivation than lipid viruses. Also called nonenveloped or hydrophilic viruses. One-step disinfection process : simultaneous cleaning and disinfection of a noncritical surface or item. Pasteurization : process developed by Louis Pasteur of heating milk, wine, or other liquids to 65- 77\u00b0C (or the equivalent) for approximately 30 minutes to kill or markedly reduce the number of pathogenic and spoilage organisms other than bacterial spores. Parametric release : declaration that a product is sterile on the basis of physical and/or chemical process data rather than on sample testing or biologic indicator results. Penicylinder : carriers inoculated with the test bac teria for in vitro tests of germicides. Can be constructed of stainless steel, porcelain, glass, or other materials and are approximately 8 x 10 mm in diameter. Permissible exposure limit (PEL ): time -weighted average maximum concentration of an air contam inant to which a worker can be exposed, according to OSHA standards. Usually calculated over 8 hours, with exposure considered over a 40- hour work week. Personal protective equipment (PPE ): specialized clothing or equipment worn by an employee for protect ion against a hazard. General work clothes (e.g., uniforms, pants, shirts) not intended to function as protection against a hazard are not considered to be PPE. Parts per million (ppm): common measurement for concentrations by volume of trace contaminant gases in the air (or chemicals in a liquid); 1 volume of contaminated gas per 1 million volumes of contaminated air or 1\u00a2 in $10,000 both equal 1 ppm. Parts per million = \u00b5g mL or mg L. Prions : transmissible pathogenic agents that cause a variety of neurodegenerative diseases of humans and animals, including sheep and goats, bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle, and Creutzfeldt - Jakob disease in humans. They are unlike any other infectious pathogens because they are composed of an abnormal confor mational isoform of a normal cellular protein, the prion protein (PrP). Prions are extremely resistant to inactivation by sterilization processes and disinfecting agents. Process challenge device (PCD) : item designed to simulate product to be sterilized a nd to constitute a defined challenge to the sterilization process and used to assess the effective performance of the process. A PCD is a challenge test pack or test tray that contains a biologic indicator, a Class 5 integrating indicator, or an enzyme- only indicator. QUAT : abbreviation for quaternary ammonium compound, a surface- active, water -soluble disinfecting substance that has four carbon atoms linked to a nitrogen atom through covalent bonds. Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 103 of 163 Recommended exposure limit (REL): occupational exposure limit recommended by NIOSH as being protective of worker health and safety over a working lifetime. Frequently expressed as a 40- hour time- weighted- average exposure for up to 10 hours per day during a 40- work week. Reprocess: method to ensure proper disinfection or sterilization; can include: cleaning, inspection, wrapping, sterilizing, and storing. Sanitizer: agent that reduces the number of bacterial contaminants to safe levels as judged by public health requirements. Commonly used with substances appli ed to inanimate objects. According to the protocol for the official sanitizer test, a sanitizer is a chemical that kills 99.999% of the specific test bacteria in 30 seconds under the conditions of the test. Shelf life : length of time an undiluted or use dilution of a product can remain active and effective. Also refers to the length of time a sterilized product (e.g., sterile instrument set) is expected to remain sterile. Spaulding classification : strategy for reprocessing contaminated medical devices. The system classifies a medical device as critical, semicritical, or noncritical on the basis of risk to patient safety from contamination on a device. The system also established three levels of germicidal activity (sterilization, high-level disinfection, a nd low -level disinfection) for strategies with the three classes of medical devices (critical, semicritical, and noncritical). Spore: relatively water -poor round or elliptical resting cell consisting of condensed cytoplasm and nucleus surrounded by an impervious cell wall or coat. Spores are relatively resistant to disinfectant and sterilant activity and drying conditions (specifically in the genera Bacillus and Clostridium ). Spore strip : paper strip impregnated with a known population of spores that meet s the definition of biological indicators. Steam quality : steam characteristic reflecting the dryness fraction (weight of dry steam in a mixture of dry saturated steam and entrained water) and the level of noncondensable gas (air or other gas that will not condense under the conditions of temperature and pressure used during the sterilization process). The dryness fraction (i.e., the proportion of completely dry steam in the steam being considered) should not fall below 97%. Steam sterilization : sterili zation process that uses saturated steam under pressure for a specified exposure time and at a specified temperature, as the sterilizing agent. Steam sterilization, dynamic air removal type: one of two types of sterilization cycles in which air is removed from the chamber and the load by a series of pressure and vacuum excursions (prevacuum cycle) or by a series of steam flushes and pressure pulses above atmospheric pressure (steam -flush - pressure- pulse cycle). Sterile or Sterility : state of being free from all living microorganisms. In practice, usually described as a probability function, e.g., as the probability of a microorganism surviving sterilization being one in one million. Sterility assurance level (SAL) : probability of a viable microorganism being present on a product unit after sterilization. Usually expressed as 10-6; a SAL of 10-6 means 1/1 million chance that a single viable microorganism is present on a sterilized item. A SAL of 10-6 generally is accepted as appropriate for items intende d to contact compromised tissue (i.e., tissue that has lost the integrity of the natural body barriers). The sterilizer manufacturer is responsible for ensuring the sterilizer can achieve the desired SAL. The user is responsible for monitoring the performance of the sterilizer to ensure it is operating in conformance to the manufacturer's recommendations. Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: M ay 2019 104 of 163 Sterilization : validated process used to render a product free of all forms of viable microorganisms. In a sterilization process, the presence of microorganisms on any individual item can be expressed in terms of probability. Although this probability can be reduced to a very low number, it can never be reduced to zero. Sterilization area: area of a health- care facility designed to house sterilization eq uipment, such as steam ethylene oxide, hydrogen peroxide gas plasma, or ozone sterilizers. Sterilizer: apparatus used to sterilize medical de vices, equipment, or supplies by direct exposure to the sterilizing agent. Sterilizer, gravity -displacement type : type of steam sterilizer in which incoming steam displaces residual air through a port or drain in or near the bottom (usually) of the sterilizer chamber. Typical operating temperatures are sterilizer that depends on one or more pressure and vacuum excursions at the beginning of the cycle to remove air. This method of operation results in shorter cycle times for wrapped items because of the rapid removal of air fro m the chamber and the load by the vacuum system and because of the usually higher operating temperature (132- 135\u00b0C [270-275\u00b0F ]; 141 - 144\u00b0C [285- 291\u00b0F]). This type of sterilizer generally provides for shorter exposure time and accelerated drying of fabric loads by pulling a further vacuum at the end of the sterilizing cycle. Sterilizer, steam -flush pressure -pulse type : type of sterilizer in which a repeated sequence consisting of a steam flush and a pressure pulse removes air from the sterilizing chamber and processed materials using steam at above atmospheric pressure (no vacuum is required). Like a prevacuum sterilizer, a steam -flush pressure- pulse sterilizer rapidly removes air from the sterilizing chamber and wrapped items; however, the system is not s usceptible to air leaks because air is removed with the sterilizing chamber pressure at above atmospheric pressure. Typical operating temperatures are 121 reduces the surface tension of water or the tension at the interface between water and another liquid; a wetting agent found in many sterilants and disinfectants. Tabletop steam sterilizer : a compact gravity -displacement steam sterilizer that has a chamber volume of not more than 2 cubic feet and that generates its own steam when distilled or deionized water is added. Time -weighted average (TWA): an average of all the concentrations of a chemical to which a worker has been exposed during a specific sampling time, reported as an average over the sampling time. For example, the permissible exposure limit for ethylene oxide is 1 ppm as an 8- hour TWA. Exposures above the ppm limit are permitted if they are compensated for by equal or longer exposures below the limit during the 8- hour workday as long as they do not exceed the ceiling limit; short -term exposure limit; or, in the case of ethylene oxide, excursion limit of 5 ppm averaged over a 15- minute sampling period. Tuberculocide : an EPA -classified hospital disinfect ant that also kills Mycobacterium tuberculosis (tubercle bacilli). EPA has registered approximately 200 tuberculocides. Such agents also are called mycobactericides . Use- life: the length of time a diluted product can remain active and effective. The stabi lity of the chemical and the storage conditions (e.g., temperature and presence of air, light, organic matter, or metals) determine the use- life of antimicrobial products.

As newer disinfectants become available, persons or committees responsible for selecting disinfectants and sterilization processes should be guided by products cleared by the FDA and the EPA as well as information in the scientific literature. 1 See text for discussion of hydrotherapy. 2 The longer the exposure to a disinfectant, the more likely it is that all microorganisms will be eliminated. Foll ow the Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (2008) Last update: May 2019 112 of 163 FDA-cleared high- level disinfection claim. Ten- minute exposure is not adequate to disinfect many objects, especially those that are difficult to clean because they have narrow channels or other areas that can harbor organic material and bacteria. Tw enty-minute exposure at 20\u00b0C is the minimum time needed to reliably kill M. tuberculosis and nontuberculous mycobacteria with a 2% glutaraldehyde. Some high- level disinfectants have a reduced exposure time (e.g., ortho- phthalaldehyde at 12 minutes at 20\u00b0C) because of their rapid activity against mycobacteria or reduced exposure time due to increased mycobactericidal activity at elevated temperature (e.g., 2.5% glutaraldehyde at 5 minutes at 35\u00b0C, 0.55% OPA at 5 min at 25\u00b0C in automated endoscope reprocessor ). 3 Tubing must be completely filled for high- level disinfection and liquid chemical sterilization; care must be taken to avoid entrapment of air bubbles during immersion. 4 Material compatibility should be investigated when appropriate. 5 A concentration of 1000 ppm available chlorine should be considered where cultures or concentrated preparations of microorganisms have spilled (5.25% to 6.15% household bleach diluted 1:50 provides > 1000 ppm available chlorine). This solution may corrode some surfaces. 6 Pasteurization (washer -disinfector) of respiratory therapy or anesthesia equipment is a recognized alternative to high- level disinfection. Some data challenge the efficacy of some pasteurization units. 7 Thermostability should be investigated when appropriate. 8 Do not mix rectal and oral thermometers at any stage of handling or processing. 9 By law, all applicable label instructions on EPA -registered products must be followed. If the user selects exposure conditions that differ from those on the EPA- registered products label, the user assumes liability from any injuries resulting from off -label use and is potentially subject to enforcement action under FIFRA.

Properties of an ideal disinfectant Broad spectrum: should have a wide antimicrobial spectrum Fast acting: should produce a rapid kill Not affected by environmental factors: should be active in the presence of organic matter (e.g., blood, sputum, feces) and compatible with soaps, detergents, and other chemicals encountered in use Nontoxic: should not be harmful to the user or patient Surface compatibility: should not corrode instruments and metallic surfaces and should not cause the deterioration of cloth, rubber, plastics, and other materials Residual effect on treated surfac es: should leave an antimicrobial film on the treated surface Easy to use with clear label directions Odorless: should have a pleasant odor or no odor to facilitate its routine use Economical: should not be prohibitively high in cost Solubility: should be soluble in water Stability: should be stable in concentrate and use- dilution Cleaner: should have good cleaning properties Environmentally friendly: should not damage the environment on disposal Modified from Molinari1035.

Epidemiologic evidence associated with the use of surface disinfec tants or detergents on noncritical environmental surfaces Justification for Use of Disinfectants for Noncritical Environmental Surfaces Surfaces may contribute to transmission of epidemiologically important microbes (e.g., vancomycin- resistant Enterococci, methicillin -resistant S. aureus, viruses) Disinfectants are needed for surfaces contaminated by blood and other potentially infective material Disinfectants are more effective than detergents in reducing microbial load on floors Detergents become contaminated and result in seeding the patient's environment with bacteria Disinfection of noncritical equipment and surfaces is recommended for patients on isolation precautions by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Advantage of using a single produc t for decontamination of noncritical surfaces, both floors and equipment Some newer disinfectants have persistent antimicrobial activity Justification for Using a Detergent on Noncritical Environmental Surfaces Noncritical surfaces contribute minimally to endemic healthcare- associated infections No difference in healthcare -associated infection rates when floors are cleaned with detergent versus disinfectant No environmental impact (aquatic or terrestrial) issues with disposal No occupational health exposur e issues Lower costs Use of antiseptics/disinfectants selects for antibiotic -resistant bacteria (?)

Factors affecting the efficacy of sterilization Factors Effect Cleaning1 Failure to adequately clean instrument results in higher bioburden, protein load, and salt concentration. These will decrease sterilization efficacy. Bioburden1 The natural bioburden of used surgical devices is 100 to 103 organisms (primarily vegetative bacteria), which is substantially below the 105-106 spores used with biological indicators. Pathogen type Spore -forming organisms are most resistant to sterilization and are the test organisms required for FDA clearance. However, the contaminating microflora on used surgical instruments consists mainly of vegetative bacteria. Protein1 Residual protein decreases efficacy of sterilization. However, cleaning appears to rapidly remove protein load. Salt1 Residual salt decre ases efficacy of sterilization more than does protein load. However, cleaning appears to rapidly remove salt load. Biofilm accumulation1 Biofilm accumulation reduces efficacy of sterilization by impairing exposure of the sterilant to the microbial cell. Lumen length Increasing lumen length impairs sterilant penetration. May require forced flow through lumen to achieve sterilization. Lumen diameter Decreasing lumen diameter impairs sterilant penetration. May require forced flow through lumen to achieve sterilization. Restricted flow Sterilant must come into contact with microorganisms. Device designs that prevent or inhibit this contact (e.g., sharp bends, blind lumens) will decrease sterilization efficacy. Device design and construction Materials used in construction may affect compatibility with different sterilization processes and affect sterilization efficacy. Design issues (e.g., screws, hinges) will also affect sterilization efficacy.

Suggested protocol for management of positive biological indicator in a steam sterilizer Format Change [February 2017]: The format of this section was changed to improve readability and accessibility. The content is unchanged. 1. Take the sterilizer out of service. Notify area supervisor and infection control department. 2. Objects, other than implantable objects, do not need to be recalled because of a single positive spore test unless the sterilizer or the sterilization procedure is defective. As soon as possible, repeat biological indicator test in three consecutive sterilizer cycles. If additional spore tests remain positiv e, the items should be considered nonsterile, and supplies processed since the last acceptable (negative) biological indicator should be recalled. The items from the suspect load(s) should be recalled and reprocessed. 3. Check to ensure the sterilizer was us ed correctly (e.g., verify correct time and temperature setting). If not, repeat using appropriate settings and recall and reprocess all inadequately processed items. 4. Check with hospital maintenance for irregularities (e.g., electrical) or changes in the hospital steam supply (i.e., from standard 97% steam, <3% moisture). Any abnormalities should be reported to the person who performs sterilizer maintenance (e.g., medical engineering, sterilizer manufacturer). 5. Check to ensure the correct biological indicator was used and appropriately interpreted. If not, repeat using appropriate settings. 6. If steps 1 through 5 resolve the problem If all three repeat biological indicators from three consecutive sterilizer cycles (step 2 above) are negative, put the steriliz er back in service. 7. If one or both biological indicators are positive, do one or more of the following until problem is resolved. A. Request an inspection of the equipment by sterilizer maintenance personnel. B. Have hospital maintenance inspect the steam supply lines. C. Discuss the abnormalities with the sterilizer manufacturer. D. Repeat the biological indicator using a different manufacturer's indicator. If step 7 does not resolve the problem Close sterilizer down until the manufacturer can assure that it is operating properly. Retest at that time with biological indicators in three consecutive sterilizer cycles. Modified from Bryce. 839 Disclosure of Financial Interests and Relationships (2000- July 2004) William A.
