CAM refers to treatment that can be used in addition to normal standard medical care, which is conducted by physicians, doctors of osteopathy and allied health professionals. Some examples of CAM are acupuncture, chiropractic care, meditation, massage therapy, and herbal medicine. Utilizing these services in addition to traditional medical care can significantly reduce pain such as low-back pain, cervical pain, and neck pain. In addition CAM may relieve stress, depression, nausea, vomiting, and regulate blood pressure. The main focus of CAM products are mind and body medicine, manipulative therapy, and body based practices. Over 38% of American adults have utilized CAM in an effort to reduce pain to increase quality of life. Service members may utilize CAM in addition to their medical treatment, and this service is often available at Navy Medical Treatment Facilities.
