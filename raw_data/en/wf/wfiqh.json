What's in your dog's vaccines and can dog vaccine ingredients cause common diseases and health issues?", "sitename": "Dogs Naturally", "date": "2022-09-14", "cleaned_text": "Ever wonder what's in that harmless-looking tiny bottle your vet injects into your dog? Or why so many folks and the media are making such a big stink about not vaccinating animals or children? Or why you never hear about a lawsuit against a Pharma company for injury to a child or an animal? We don't have the room here to delve into all the answers ... but suffice it to say, you should be asking these questions and many more. And perhaps the first question you should ask is ... What's In My Dog's Vaccine? If you want the condensed version of this article, an abbreviated list of dog vaccine ingredients is below. But remember, we take more time to analyze what new cell phone to buy than we do research what's injected into our dogs. I urge you take the deep dive but - fair warning - it's not a comforting story ... The Toxic Cocktail All vaccines are basically made the same way. The variations in the ingredients are only slight from company to company, and from species to species (humans, dogs, horses, etc) ... except, that is, for the virus particles themselves.. There was a time when the ingredients were available on a large ingredient insert. Transparency didn't seem to be an issue before ... but now it's getting harder and harder to find out exactly what's in vaccines. As a vet, [the FDAs](https://www.fda.gov/home) protection of formulas doesn't provide me with enough data to recommend vaccine types or schedules ... It's usually one-size-fits-all. And frankly, for your dog that means buyer beware. Types Of Ingredients Although we don't know all the ingredients of every individual vaccine ... we do know the sorts of ingredients common in most vaccines: - Adjuvants: aluminum Growth medium: foreign animal tissues: - Chick embryo - Bovine serum - Human fetal lung tissue - Monkey kidney tissue - Porcine tissue - Eggs - Insect proteins - 80 (Tween\u00ae 80). - Virus particles: individual vaccines (modified live or killed), contamination viruses (Rotavirus) from the animal tissues used to grow vaccines. - Contaminates: glyphosate from GMO-fed animals ... used for vaccine growth medium (eggs, bovine and porcine tissue), insect viruses (Army worm), Rotavirus. These ingredient highlights should make you shudder ... and [hesitate to vaccinate](https://www.dogsnaturallymagazine.com/everything-to-know-about-parvovirus-vaccine/) until you gather more information. I suggest you keep reading ... so you understand what injecting these into your dog means for her longevity and vitality ... and ultimately for the health of all animals. Not to mention her endless suffering ... and your stress, as you experience an animal plagued by chronic illness. Big Pharma and the media would have you believe there might be some teeny possibility of harm that could occur rarely, if ever, on a purple planet, far, far away ... but mostly vaccines are good and everyone needs them! They want us to believe there's no ugly, only good. I beg to differ, as would many thousands of doctors and healthcare providers who study the ugly. I'm sharing some of that information with you here. RELATED: [An Inexpensive Way To Prevent Over-Vaccination](https://www.dogsnaturallymagazine.com/dog-vaccinations-detox/) ... The 1st Ugly - Adjuvants These are chemicals added to vaccines to enhance and lengthen the immune response ... especially at the local injection site. They're mostly aluminum salts discovered many years ago as pickling agents. Yes, for pickles! I'm hoping I never ate any of those pickles. There is no biosystem that uses the heavy metal aluminum - none! Once aluminum is in the body, it's difficult to remove. It's troubling how this method of pickling cucumbers became an ingredient to supercharge vaccines ... the aluminum adjuvants turn on the immune system. It's done in a non-selective, non-specific way, making \"immunity\" last longer. We think of these reactions as benign and collectively call them \"allergies\" ... but anyone living with a dog with allergies knows they're far from benign. After the aluminum causes damage locally, it goes to the brain, spleen, muscles, bones, liver and heart ... where it stimulates the immune system (by presenting the virus antigen particles repeatedly). It also acts as an antigen itself, stimulating the immune system to stay \"turned on.\" In other words, it acts as an adjuvant and an antigen. These toxicants are so widely studied that there's a syndrome used to describe this complex of diseases ... It's called ASIA (Autoimmune Inflammatory Syndrome Induced by Adjuvants). Few veterinarians or human doctors are even aware of this syndrome, so it's unlikely you know about it. This syndrome shows that chronic stimulation of the immune system stimulates chronic inflammation. And that leads to chronic autoimmune disease throughout the body. That's a lot of chronic, isn't it? Autoimmune disease is as epidemic in dogs as cancer. Once inflamed, it's not easy to cool these tissues down. Other adjuvants such as squalene, sugars and lipopolysaccharides aren't naturally adjuvants ... but, added with other ingredients, they become very irritating to the immune system. They make the response to the vaccines more aggressive and longer-lasting. If your dog survives the harmful effects of heavy metals, oils, sugars and fatty sugars produced by bacteria ... there are more hurdles to jump. RELATED: [What every vet (and pet owner) should know about vaccines](https://www.dogsnaturallymagazine.com/annual-dog-vaccines-are-they-necessary/) ... The 2nd Ugly - Preservatives Vaccines are actually quite unstable at room temperature. Refrigeration and stabilization with chemicals is critical to keep everything from becoming inactive. But chemical preservatives are also needed. The most common agent is ethyl mercury ... also known as thimerosal or merthiolate (yes, what your mother used on your minor cuts). The wide use of mercury in vaccines is most likely because it's cheap. Mercury is very toxic to the central nervous system. It can disrupt normal nerve signaling and decrease motor functions ... think [degenerative myelopathy](https://www.dogsnaturallymagazine.com/degenerative-myelopathy-in-dogs/) or weakness of the spinal nerves. It can decrease memory function by destroying brain cells ... think cognition problems and Alzheimer's). For many with poor detoxifying ability to remove this heavy metal, it further causes immune dysregulation (think chaos!). Vaccines contain other preservatives to prevent foreign bacteria and fungi from growing. These include common antibiotics and fungicides ... such as gentamicin, amphotericin B, neomycin and polymyxin-B. I have to wonder if using these could be an early set up for the epidemic of antibody-resistant bacteria. And if that weren't enough, add a dash of phenoxyethanol, which is made from phenol, a known carcinogen ... which comes from benzene, another known carcinogen. This antimicrobial is the same phenol naturally found in coal tar, a highly toxic acid (aka carbolic acid) that's caustic to the skin, eyes, the respiratory system ... basically all tissues. Phenoxyethanol is commonly known to cause reproductive issues. You can find its chemical intermediate in the production of ... plastics (BPA), nylon, detergents, herbicides and pharmaceuticals. And if that weren't enough, the Third Reich used it to kill people. If that isn't sending chills up your spine, read on ... The 3rd Ugly - Attenuating Agents Attenuation is the process of altering the virus particles (called antigens). It makes them less virulent ... thus less capable of causing illness. The virus passes through certain tissues, and alters to be harmless (in theory) or less virulent ... hopefully These vaccines are called modified live ... and they make up many of the core vaccines, including parvo and distemper. The viruses are considered live but weakened ... and thus less likely to cause the full-blown clinical disease. These modified live vaccines have enough of the antigen present that the immune system elicits a stronger, longer-lasting effect on its own ... this decreases the need to add the adjuvants I discussed before. Inactivated vaccines, also called killed vaccines (rabies, polio), are usually killed by heat or formaldehyde ... a known carcinogen. These vaccines are weaker and need boosters to provide an effective immune response. So they're usually reserved for diseases that can pass from animals to humans. Adjuvants are added to killed vaccines along with more antigen ... which makes them last longer and produce more immune stimulation. This is why inactivated vaccines can cause worse reactions than modified live vaccines. Viruses infect all sorts of plants and animals. Passing virus antigens through tissue cultures of these plants or animals can allow for unwanted viral contamination ... making the vaccine cocktail infected. An added component of the vaccine cocktail is formaldehyde. A known carcinogen used as a chemical attenuating agent. Is your head spinning? Mine is! The 4th Ugly - Growth Medium Many vaccines are grown on tissue considered foreign to our dogs' bodies. The common tissues used to grow viruses for vaccines are: - Chick embryos - Fetal bovine serum - Human diploid (aborted fetus) lung - Monkey kidney - Dog kidney - Porcine gelatin These growth mediums were not meant to elicit an immune reaction ... but they certainly do. The foreign tissue cells make their way through the bloodstream exposing the organs to these proteins ... that would have never gained access to our inner sanctum. This is why anaphylaxis ... or chronic allergies to pork or eggs are common reactions after vaccines. You're probably starting to get the idea why I call these The Ugly. The 5th Ugly - Buffering Agents Buffering agents such as the sugars glycerol, sorbitol and sucrose, as well as salts and borax ... all act to buffer the varied chemical cocktail to help maintain a balanced pH. The borax I mention is sodium borate ... a Substance of Very High Concern identified by the European Chemicals Agency. It's the same detergent we grew up within the box with a mule team of 20. Its role in vaccines is unclear, except to maintain a pH balance. It's associated with increased fetal mortality, low birth weight and infant malformations. In dogs and rats it's shown to decrease fertility rates - that is, after feeding it to them. Certainly not humane ... but feeding toxic borate is not as toxic as injecting it into the body. Now you might be able to see how these cumulative ingredients could cause great harm to your dog. The 6th Ugly - Surfactants A world without surfactants would make washing our clothes difficult. Using them in vaccines allows the ingredients to mix and stay in a homogeneous solution. The main emulsifier used is polysorbate 80 (aka Tween\u00ae 80) ... found in some low-quality salad dressings, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. It's shown to affect biofilms on the skin and in the gut by increasing the growth of certain bacteria ... like Staphlococcus aureus. Polysorbate 80 in vaccines increases the permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This allows heavy metals (aluminum and mercury) in the vaccines ... or from other environmental exposures circulating in the body - to cross the BBB. And it also allows for other vaccine ingredients to cross the BBB. Animal testing (here we go again!) has shown harmful effects on reproduction, heart function, behavior changes and carcinogenicity. And the toxic cherry on the top is the breakdown of Tween\u00ae 80 to [ sorbitol](https://www.dogsnaturallymagazine.com/is-sorbitol-safe-for-dogs/), which increases the risk of diabetes. Where's The Good? When you find it, let me know! I can't, for the life of me, find the good. Studying vaccines and vaccinology for 31 years doesn't make me a vaccine expert ... but it makes me well educated on the subject. If I had no other options I might think vaccines were the only method of protection. If I hadn't studied them for so many years, I might not realize their danger and risk. And I may not have connected the dots between vaccination and the conditions that follow. But, I have studied vaccines and so has the US Congress. Current law regards vaccines as \"unavoidably unsafe.\" SCOTUS (the US Supreme Court) has supported that law. In my mind, I'd be violating of my Hippocratic Oath ... to First Do No Harm, if I inject your dog with a vaccine that includes the above ingredients. When necessary, added to the foundations of wellness (such as clean, fresh food, clean water, no oral or topical pesticides, ample exercise and socialization, herbal and nutritional supplement support) ... nosodes let the immune system provide adequate protection without poisoning your dog's body. This will support the development of a strong immune system for a lifetime of protection.
