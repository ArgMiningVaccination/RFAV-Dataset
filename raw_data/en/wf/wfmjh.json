Changes to the previous version are highlighted in yellow. This document covers: Section 2: the list of QOF indicators as detailed in Annex D of the SFE Directions Section 3: specific information about each clinical indicator including the rationale for inclusion and any specific requirements which contractors need to demonstrate to ensure achievement Section 4: specific information about each public healt h indicato r including the rationale for inclusion and any specific requirements which contractors need to demonstrate to ensure achievement Section 5: detailed information about the requirements of the quality improvement domain Section 6: detailed information about Personalised Care Adjustment Section 7: a full list of indicators which are no longer in QOF but are subject to ongoing data collection Section 8: glossary of acronyms Section 9: the process for raising queries in relation to QOF indicators an d their interpretation Section 10: summary of clinical and public health indicator changes for 2021/22 This guidance should be read in conjunction with the SFE Directions and Business Rules. Definition of 'commissioner' The NHS C ommissioning Board (NHS CB) is the organisation legally responsible for the commissioning of primary care in England, which operates under the name NHS England. NHS England is used throughout this guidance, except where it is necessary to use NHS CB to ref lect the SFE Directions. Following the 1 https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs -primary -medical -services -directions -2013 4 implementation of co -commissioning arrangements references to 'commissioners' in this document could refer to NHS England or a clinical commissioning group (CCG). Additional indicator information Full descriptions of each indicator, its rationale for inclusion and any specific criteria for reporting and verification are detailed in Sections 3, 4 and 5. Clinical and public health indicators Clinical and public health indicators are organised by disease or intervention categories. These indicators have been selected as they represent care where: The responsibility for ongoing management rests principally with the contractor and the primary care team There is good evidence of the health benefits likely to res ult from improved primary care Indicator numbering Indicators are prefixed with an abbreviation of the category to which they belong. For example, coronary heart disease indicator one is identified as CHD001. Indicator IDs are unique to each indicator and are not reused. New indicators will be given the next available unused number. Therefore, this may not flow sequentially from the existing indicator IDs. Similarly, where there has been a change to indicator wording, activity timescales or significant chan ges to coding or the data extraction logic these indicators will be given a new unique ID. This is to ensure that indicators are not inappropriately compared to those in previous years and to avoid any confusion which could arise from re -using ID numbers. Where an indicator has been developed through the NICE led process2 it will also be annotated with its NICE menu ID number (NICE [year] menu ID: NMXX). If a NICE developed indicator has been amended during negotiations this will be annotated with 'based o n NMXX'. References to NICE guidance throughout this document relate to the guidance that has been used to underpin the stated indicators. In some cases, new or updated guidance may have been recently published, or will be published before the end of the Q OF year. These guidelines will be reviewed by NICE in due course and any recommendations concerning amending current indicators or development of new indicators will be published in future NICE indicator menus for consideration by relevant parties. Identif ying the target population or disease register Clinical indicators all have a defined target population. This may be defined within a register indicator or as part of the bu siness rules. This target population will be identified either by the presence of p redetermined clinical diagnosis codes in the patient record or by using other attributes of the patient such as age and sex . For example, the target population for cervical screening is constructed using age and sex to determine inclusion in the denominato r for each indicator. Where the target 2 https://www.nice.org.uk/media/default/Get -involved/Meetings -In-Public/indicator -advisory - committee/ioc -process -guide.pdf 5 population is identified using clinical codes the contractor is responsible for demonstrating that it has systems in place to maintain a high quality, accurate register. This may be verified by the commissioner and co ntractors may be asked to explain reasons for variation from expected prevalence levels. Contractors are reminded that QOF registers must not be used as the sole input for the purposes of patient care and clinical audit. There may be patients for whom a tr eatment or activity is clinically appropriate , but they may not meet the criteria as defined by the QOF register. Contractors are reminded of this when developing their call /recall systems . Patients with co -morbidities will be included in all relevant target populations and registers where they meet the defined criteria. Where a patient is in more than one target population then they are eligible for the interventions outlin ed in all the relevant disease areas. Some indicators refer to a sub -set of patients in the target population or register. Patients who are not included in an indicator denominator for definitional reasons are classified as 'exclusions' and are automatical ly identified thro ugh the business rules and removed from the denominator. Patients are eligible for the interventions outlined in QOF indicators as soon as they are fully registered with the contractor or a relevant diagnosis is recorded. Quality improvem ent indicators Section 5 provides detailed guidance on the interpretation of the quality improvement indicators and the aims and objectives which their quality improvement plans should be seeking to address. Reporting, payment calculation and verification Reporting Reporting requirements and the rules for the calculation of QOF points and their payment are set out in the SFE. For most indicators anonymised data will be collected automatically from GP clinical systems by the General Practice Extraction Service (GPES) and reported to Calculating Quality Reporting Service (CQRS). The clinical codes and logical extraction sequence used in this data collection is defined in a series of technical documents - the Business Rules. These are based entirely on SNOMED codes and associated dates. SNOMED codes are an NHS standard. Contractors using proprietary coding systems and/or local/practice specific codes will need to be aware that these codes will not be recognised within QOF reporting. The Business Rules are updated twice yearly around April and October and are available on the NHS Digital website .3 For indicators where achievement is not automatically collected th is should be self - declared through the CQR S web-based server. Commissioners may request the evidence underpinn ing this self -declaration as part of their verification processes. 3 NHS Digital. http://content.digital.nhs.uk/qofesextractspecs 6 Payment calculation and achievement CQRS will calculate achievement and payme nts for QOF as set out in the SFE and report to commissioners and practices. Whilst full details of the achievement calculations are detailed in the SFE, the following key points are useful to note : Achievement is measured on the last day of the financial year, i.e. 31 March in respect of patients registered with the practice on that date. Whilst estimates o f achievement may be made through the year these may not accurately predict final performance. The time -period referred to in an indicator is calculated by counting back from the last day of the financial year. Time periods vary between indicators . The phr ase 'currently treated' should be interpreted as a prescription for the specified medication being given in the six months preceding the last day of the financial year , i.e. between 1 October and 31 March . Some indicators require the intervention to be offered to patients when they reach a defined age or within a specified time before and/or after diagnosis. Care recorded outside of these time periods will not be recognised in the QOF achievement calculation . There are specific provisions within the SFE which describe the calculations to be made where a contract comes to an end before the last day of the financi al year. Verification The contractor must ensure that it is able to provide any information that th e NHS CB or commissioner may reasonably request of it to demonstrate that it is entitled to each achievement point to which it says it is entitled. The contractor must make that information available to the commissioner on request. In verifying that an ind icator has been achieved and information correctly recorded, the commissioner may choose to inspect the output from a computer search that has been used to provide information on the indicator, or a sample of patient records relevant to the indicator. Comm issioners and practices will be aware of the requirements of access to patient identifiable data. Where patients have expressed a desire that their information is not shared for this purpose, practices will need to advise the commissioner and make an appro priate note in the record. Commissioners and practices will be aware of the need to: obtain the minimum necessary information for the specific purpose anonymise data where possible It is recommended that practices record access to confidential patient dat a in the relevant patient record, so that an audit trail is in place to fulfil the obligations of the practice towards their patients and that of commissioners to practices. 7 The terms 'notes' and 'patient record' are used to indicate either electronic or paper patient records. Disputes When a QOF related contractual dispute arises, the commissioner and the contractor, would be expected to make every reasonable effort to communicate and co-operate with each other with a view to resolving the dispute without the need to refer it for formal determination by NHS Resolution (Primary Care Appeals) (or in certain cases, the courts). Further information is available in the SFE. 8 Section 2: Summary of all indicators4 Section 2.1: Clinical domain ( 401 points ) Section 2.1. applies to all contractors participating in QOF.

Remission from severe mental illness Making an accurate diagnosis of remission can be challenging. In the absence of strong evidence of what constitutes 'remission' from severe mental illness, clinic ians should only consider using the se codes if the patient has been in remission for at least five years, that is where there is: no record of antipsychotic medication no mental health in -patient episodes; and no secondary or community care mental health follow -up for at least five years. Where a patient is recorded as being 'in remission' they remain on the MH001 register (in case their condition relapses at a later date) but they are excluded from the denominator for indicators MH002, MH003, MH00 6, MH007, MH011 and MH012 . 17 The accuracy of this coding should be reviewed on an annual basis by a clinician. Should a patient who has been coded as 'in remission' experience a relapse then this should be recorded as such in their patient record. In the even t that a patient experiences a relapse and is coded as such, they will again be included in all the associated indicators for schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder and other psychoses and their care plan should be updated. Where a patient has relapsed after being recorded as being in remission, their care plan should be updated subsequent to the relapse. Care plans dated prior to the date of the relapse will not be acceptable for QOF purposes. Cancer (CAN) Indicator Points Achievement thresholds Records CAN001.

Aged 75 or over with a record of a fragility fracture on or after 1 April 2014 and a diagnosis of osteoporosis (NICE 2011 menu ID: NM29 ) 3 Disease register for osteoporosis Although the register indicator OST004 defines two separate registers, the disease register for the purpose of calculating the APDF is defined as the sum of the number of patients on both registers. 19 Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) Indicator Points Achievement thresholds Records RA001. The contractor establishes and maintains a register of patients aged 16 or over with rheumatoid arthritis (NICE 2012 menu ID: NM55 ) 1 Ongoing management RA002. The percentage of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, on the register, who have had a face-to-face review in the preceding 12 months (NICE 2012 menu ID: NM58 ) 5 40-90% Palliative care (PC) Indicator Points Achievement thresholds Records PC001. The contractor establishes and maintains a register of all patients in need of palliative care/support irrespective of age 3 Disease register for palliative care There is no APDF calculation in respect of the palliative care indicators. In the rare case of a nil register at year end, if a contractor can demonstrate that it established and maintained a register during the financial year then they will be eligible for payment for PC001. Non diabetic hyperglycaemia (NDH ) Indicator Points Achievement thresholds Records NDH001. The percentage of patients with non-diabetic hyperglycaemia who have had an HbA1c or fasting blood glucose performed in the preceding 12 months (NICE 2017 menu ID: NM150) 18 50-90% 20 Section 2.2: Public health domain ( 160 points ) Section 2.2.1: Public health domain Section 2.2.1. applies to all contractors participating in QOF.

The percentage of patients aged 15 or over who are recorded as current smokers who have a record of an offer of support and treatment within the preceding 24 month s (based on NM40 ) 12 40-90% SMOK005. The percentage of patients with any or any combination of the following conditions: CHD, PAD, stroke or TIA, hypertension, diabetes, COPD, CKD, asthma, schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder or other psychoses who are recorded as current smoker s 25 56-96% 21 who have a record of an offer of support and treatment within the preceding 12 months (NICE 2011 menu ID: NM39 ) Disease register for smoking The disease register for the purpose of calculating the APDF for SMOK002 and SMOK005 is defined as the sum of the number of patients on the disease registers for each of the conditions listed in the indicators. Any patient who has one or more co-morbidities , e.g. diabetes and CHD, is only counted once on the register for SMOK002 and SMOK005. There is no APDF calculation for SMOK004. Requirements for recording smoking status Smokers For patients who smoke this recording should be made in the preceding 12 months for SMOK002. Non-smokers It is recognised that life -long non -smokers are very unlikely to start smoking and indeed find it quite irritating to be asked repeatedly regarding their smoking status. Smoking status for this group of patients should be recorded in the preceding 12 months for SMOK002 until the end of the financial year in which the patient reaches the age of 25. Once a patient is over the age of 25 years (e.g. in the financial year in which they reach the age of 26 or in any year following that financial year) to be classified as a non-smoker they should be recorded as: never smoked which is both after their 25th birthday and after the earliest diagnosis date for the disease which led to the patient's inclusion on the SMOK002 register (e.g. one of the conditions listed on the SMOK002 register).

The Framingham Study. 25 Where a patient has been diagnosed with AF and been subsequently successfully treated, if there is an 'AF resolved code' present in their record after the latest AF recording, they will b e removed from the register. AF may resolve in some specific and limited situations. Contractors should also note that patients who h ave been recorded with AF resolved, continue to be at an increased risk of stroke compared to patien ts who have never had an episode of AF.7 Contractors should consider the implications of this for individual patients before using the AF resolved code. AF indicator 006 (NICE 2014 menu ID: NM81) The percentage of patients with atrial fibrillation in whom stroke risk has been assessed using CHA 2DS 2-VAS c score risk stratification scoring system in the preceding 12 months (excluding those patients with a previous CHADS 2 or CHA 2DS 2-VAS c score of 2 or more) AF 006.1 Rationale The NICE guideline on atrial fibrillation8 recommends that people with symptomatic or asymptomatic paroxysmal, persistent or permanent AF, atrial flutter and/or a continuing risk of arrhythmia recurrence after cardioversion back to sinus rhythm should have an assessment of their stroke risk using the CHA 2DS 2-VAS c risk assessment tool . The CHA 2DS 2-VAS c is a refinement of CHADS 2. The revised CHA 2DS 2-VAS c system scores one point, up to a maximum of nine, for each of the following risk factors (except previous stroke or TIA, or age 75 which scores double, hence the '2'): C: congestive HF (one point) H: hypertension (one point) A2: age 75 or over (two poin ts) D: diabetes mellitus (one point) S2: previous stroke or TIA or thromboembolism (two points) V: vascular disease (e.g. PAD, MI, aortic plaque) (one point) A: age 65 -74 years (one point) Sc: sex category (i.e. female sex) (one point) AF 006.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria.

Around 1.2 million people in England are known to be at risk of stroke from AF ,9 though it is estimated a n additional 257,571 may be at -risk.10 Of these, around three - quarters are taking anti -coagulants in primary care. An SSNAP audit has concluded that \"if everyone with atrial fibrillation was treated with anticoagulants appropriately then about 6000 stroke would be prevented each year\" .11 All patients with AF and a CHA 2DS 2-VAS c score of two or above should be offered anti-coagulation therapy taking their bleeding risk into account. A CHA 2DS 2-VAS c score of one in women (women under age 65 with no other risk factors) should be regarded as low risk and should not receive anti -coagulation. Men with a CHA 2DS 2- VAS c score of one shou ld be regarded as at intermediate risk and a group in whom anti-coagulat ion should be considered. Anti-coagulation may be with Apixaban, Dabigatran Etexilate, Rivaroxaban, Edoxaban or a vitamin K antagonist. Practices should not offer aspirin monotherapy solely for stroke prevention to people with AF. Aspirin is not as effective as anti - coagulants at preventing stroke in people with AF who are at increased risk of stroke and is also not as safe in terms of causing bleeding. Although the risks of anti - coagul ation also increase with age, the evidence also shows that its benefits outweigh the risks in the vast majority of people with AF. NICE provide a patient decision aid12 to support discussions with patients as to the risks and benefits of taking anticoagula nts. AF 007.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria. The Business Rules will look for the latest CHA 2DS 2-VAS c score in the patient record and if the score is equal to, or greater than two, the patient will be included i n the denominator.

This indicator set refers to all patients with HF unless specified otherwise. 30 HF indicator 001 The contractor establishes and maintains a register of patients with heart failure HF 001.1 Rationale All patients with a diagnosis of HF, are included on the register. HF 001.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria. There are two disease registers used for the HF indicators for the purpose of calculating APDF (practice prevalence): a register of patients with HF is used to calculate APDF for HF001 , HF005, an d HF007 , a of with HF due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) is used to calculate APDF for HF003 and HF006. Register 1 is defined in indicator HF001. Register 2 is a sub -set of register 1 and is composed of patients with a di agnostic code for LVSD or a reduced ejection fraction of <40% as well as for HF. HF indicator 005 (based on NM 171) The percentage of patients with a diagnosis of heart failure on or after 1 April 2021 which: 1. Has been confirmed by an echocardiogram or by specialist assessment between 3 months before or 6 months after entering on to the register; or 2. If newly registered in the preceding 12 months, with no record of the diagnosis originally being confirmed by echocardiogram or specialist assessment, a rec ord of an echocardiogram or a specialist assessment within 6 months of the date of registration. HF 00 5.1 Rationale The aim of this indicator is to encourage practices to confirm diagnoses of heart failure and establish the underlying causes. Symptoms and signs suggestive of heart failure are not always sufficient to make a definitive diagnosis and further investigatio n is usually required to confirm cardiac dysfunction and to identify causes. The NICE guideline for chronic heart failure recommends that the results of serum natriuretic peptides tests should be used to determine whether people with suspected heart failur e should be referred onwards. People with raised serum natriuretic peptides should have echocardiography and specialist assessment within 6 weeks, but for those with very high levels this should be done more urgently, within 2 weeks. The NICE guideline for acute heart failure recommends that people with new suspected acute heart failure who have raised natriuretic peptides should have echocardiography within 48 hours of admission to hospital. 31 HF 005 .2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requiremen t criteria. For measurement purposes, three months before the date of diagnosis is defined as 93 days. HF indicator 003 (NICE 2019 menu ID: NM 172) In those patients with a current diagnosis of heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction, the percentage of patients who are currently treated with an ACE-I or ARB HF 003.1 Rationale There is strong clinical and cost -effectiveness evidence to support the use of ACE -I in all patients with HF with LVSD. ACE -I improve symptoms, reduce the hospitalisation rate and improve the survival rate. This is applicable in all age groups. It is poss ible to have a diagnosis of LVSD without HF, for example, asymptomatic people who might be identified coincidently but who are at high risk of developing subsequent HF. In such cases, ACE -I's delay the onset of symptomatic HF, reduce cardiovascular events and improve long -term survival. This indicator only applies to patients with HF and therefore excludes this other group of patients who are nevertheless to be considered for treatment with ACE -I. NICE NG10616 recommends ACE -I is used as first -line therapy in all patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction usually defined as LVSD and that ARBs are used only in patients who are intolerant of ACE -I. HF 003.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria. HF indicator 006 (NICE 2 019 menu ID: NM173) HF006. The percentage of patients with a current diagnosis of heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction, who are currently treated with a beta -blocker licensed for heart failure HF 006.1 Rationale The NICE guideline for chronic heart failure17 recommend s that beta -blockers licensed for HF are used as first -line therapy in all patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction usually defined as LVSD . It also recommends that treatment with beta-blockers is not withheld solely because of age or the presence of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), erectile dysfunction (ED), DM, in terstitial pulmonary disease and COPD without reversibility. The only co -morbidities with a clear contra -indication to beta -blocker use are those with asthma and reversible airways obstruction (these groups were exclu ded from clinical trials). The British National Formulary (BNF) states that \"the beta -blockers bisoprolol and carvedilol are of value in any grade of stable HF and LVSD; nebivolol is licensed for stable mild to moderate HF in patients aged over 70, beta -blocker treatment should 16 https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng106 17 NICE NG106. Chronic heart failure.2018. https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng106 32 be initiated at a very low dose and titrated very slowly over a period of weeks or months by those experienced in the management of HF. Symptoms may deteriorate initially, calling for adjustment of concomitant therapy\" .18 Contractors are advised that patients already prescribed an unlicensed beta -blocker prior to diagnosis of HF due to LVSD do not have their drug therapy changed to meet the criteria of this indicator. Those patients already prescribed an unlicensed beta-blocker will be excluded from the indicat or denominator . HF 00 6.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria. Patients prescribed a beta -blocker unlicensed for heart failure before being given a diagnosis of heart failure will be excluded from this indicator. HF indicator 007 ( based on NM174) The percentage of patients with a diagnosis of heart failure on the register, who have had a review in the preceding 12 months, including an assessment of functional capacity and a review of medication to ensure medicines opt imisation at maximal tolerated doses HF 00 7.1 Rationale Regular review is associated with improvement in quality of life and a reduction in the need for urgent hospitalisation. NICE guideline NG106 recommends short monitoring intervals if the clinical condition or medication has changed and longer intervals for stable people with heart failure.

Trials of anti -hypertensive treatment have confirmed a significant reduction in the incidence of stroke and CHD in patients with treated hypertension. HYP indicator 001 The contractor establishes and maintains a register of patients with established hypertension HYP 001.1 Rationale Effective treatment of hypertension aims to reduce the risk of cardiovas cular problems such as heart attacks and strokes. Patients who have had one -off high blood pressure readings and women who have been hypertensive in pregnancy should not be included in the register. NICE NG13619 uses the following definitions: Stage 1 hy pertension Clinic blood pressure ranging from 140/90 mmHg to 159/99 mmHg and subsequent ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM ) daytime average or home blood pressure monitori ng (HBPM ) average blood pressure ranging from 135/85 mmHg to 149/94 mmHg Stage 2 hypertension Clinic blood pressure of 160/100 mmHg or higher but less than 180/120 mmHg and subsequent ABPM daytime average or HBPM average blood pressure of 150/95 mmHg or higher. Stage 3 of s evere hypertension Clinic systolic blood pressure of 180 mmHg or higher or clinic diastolic blood pressure of 120 mmHg or higher . If clinic blood pressure reading is between 140/90 mmHg and 180/120 mmHg the NICE guideline for hypertension recommen ds offering ABPM to confirm a diagnosis of hypertension . If ABPM is unsuitable or the person is unable to tolerate it HBPM is a suitable alternative to confirm a diagnosis of hypertension. For patients aged 39 or under with stage 1 hypertension and no evidence of target organ damage, CVD, renal disease or diabetes, NICE recommend that practitioners consider seeking specialist evaluation of secondary causes of hypertension and a 19 NICE NG136. Hypertension in adults: dia gnosis and management. 2019 https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng136 34 more detailed assessment of potential target organ damage. This is because 10 -year cardiovascular risk assessments can underestimate the l ifetime risk of cardiovascular events in these patients. HYP 001.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria. The contractor may be required by commissioners to discuss their plans for ensuring that new diagnoses are confirm ed using ABPM or HBPM as appropriate. HYP indicator 003 (NICE 2012 menu ID: NM53 ) The percentage of patients aged 79 years or under with hypertension in whom the last blood pressure reading (measured in the preceding 12 months) is 140/90 mmHg or less . HYP00 3.1 Rationale This indicator measures the intermediate outcome of a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg or less in people aged 79 years or under with hypertension. Its intent is to promote the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disea se through satisfactory blood pressure control. The intermediate outcome can be achieved through lifestyle advice or the use of drug ther apy. HYP003.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria. HYP indicator 007 (NICE 2012 menu ID: NM54) The percentage of patients aged 80 years and over with hypertension in whom the last blood pressure reading (measured in the preceding 12 months) is 150/90 mmHg or less . HYP007.1 Rationale The NICE guideline for hypertension20 recommends that patients aged 80 years and over with hypertension should be treated to a target blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg or less. It also recommends that this group of patients should be offered the same antihypertensive drug treatment as people aged 55-80 years, taking into account any co-morbidities. Where people have had a lower treatment target before the age of 80 years their treatment should continue and not be adjusted or back titrated. There is an important distinction between continuing long term and well tolerated treatment in people aged 80 years and older, and starting blood pressure lowering therapy at this age.

The contractor establishes and maintains a register of patients with peripheral arterial disease (NICE 2011 menu ID: NM32 ) 2 PAD - rationale for inclusion of indicator set PAD is one of the three main categories of CVD and patients with PAD, including those who are asymptom atic, have an increased risk of mortality from CVD due to MI and stroke. The relative risks of all -cause mortality are two to three times that of age and sex matched to groups without PAD. Treatment of PAD focuses on cardiovascular risk factor management. Smoking is a very important risk factor for PAD and management of PAD includes smoking cessation (see smoking indicator set). Other established risk factors are high blo od pressure and diabetes. This would mean that patients with PAD and high blood pressure would also be included in the hypertension indicator set and patients with diabetes and PAD would also be included in the diabetes indicator set. Further information NICE CG147.

About 20 per cent of patients aged 60 or over have PAD, although only a quarter of these patients have symptoms. Symptoms become severe and pr ogressive in appr oximately 20 per cent of patients with symptomatic PAD. Reduced ankle brachial pressure index is an independent predictor of cardiac and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality and may help to identify patients who would benefit from secon dary prevention.

The percentage of patients aged 80 years and over with a history of stroke or TIA in whom the last blood pressure reading (measured in the preceding 12 months) is 150/90 mmHg or less (based on NM93 ) 2 46-86% STIA - rationale for inclusion of indicator set Stroke is the third most common cause of death in the developed world. One quarter of stroke deaths occur under the age of 65. There is evidence that appropriate diagnosis and management can improve outcomes .21 STIA indicator 001 The contractor establishes and maintains a register of patients with stroke or TIA STIA 001.1 Rationale For patients diagnosed prior to 1 April 2003 it is accepted that various diagnostic criteria may have been used. For this reason, the presence of the diagnosis of stroke or TIA in the record will be acceptable. Generally, patients with a diagnosis of transient global amnesia or vertebra -basilar insuf ficiency are not included in the retrospective register. However, contractors may wish to review patients previously diagnosed and if appropriate attempt to confirm the diagnosis. 21 Stroke and transient ischaemic attack in over 16s: diagnosis and initial management http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng128 37 It is up to the contractor to decide, on clinical grounds, when to include a patient on the register , e.g. when a 'dizzy spell' becomes a TIA. Patient records coded with 'Amaurosis fugax', but without a code for TIA are excluded from the register. STIA 001.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria .

It is advised that anti -platelet therapy is prescribed for the se condary prevention of recurrent stroke and other vascular ev ents in patients who have sustained an ischaemic cerebrovascular event. The B ritish N ational F ormulary (BNF)22 makes the following recommendations: \"Patients should receive long -term treatment foll owing a transient ischaemic attack or an ischaemic stroke t o reduce the risk of further cardiovascular events. Following a transient ischaemic attack or an ischaemic stroke (not associated with AF), long -term treatment with clopidogrel [unlicensed in transient ischaemic attack] is recommended. If clopidogrel is contra -indicated or not tolerated, patients c an receive modified -release dipyridamole in combination with aspirin ; if both aspirin and clopidogrel are contra -indicated or not tolerated, then modified -release dipyridamole alone is recommended; if both mo dified -release dipyridamole and clopidogrel are contra -indicated or not tolerated, then aspirin alone is recommended.

The indicators for diabetes are generally those which would be expe cted to be done, or checked, in an annual review. There is no requirement for the contractor to carry out all of these items, but it is the contractor's responsibility to ensure that they have been done. DM indicator 017 (NICE 2017 menu ID: NM41 ) The c ontractor establishes and maintains a register of all patients aged 17 or over with diabetes mellitus which specifies the type of diabetes where a diagnosis has been confirmed DM 017.1 Rationale A greater understanding and knowledge of the complexities of diabetes has led to increasing difficulty in accurately diagnosing or classifying the type of diabetes. In March 2011, a report by the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) and NHS Diabetes was published which examined the issue of coding, classifi cation and diagnosis of diabetes in primary care in England .25 The summary findings of the report included an algorithm to provide guidance to healthcare professionals on making a new diagnosis of diabetes. In line with this report, the diabetes register indicator includes all types of diabetes within the proposed algorithm. Women with gestational diabetes are excluded from this indicator set. If it is too early in the clinical course to diagnose the specific type of diabetes, or if the specific diagnosis i s uncertain, contractors are asked to use the parent term 'diabetes mellitus'. Contractors are expected to update these patients' a nd NHS Diabetes. Coding, classification and diagnosis of diabetes. 2011. 41 their specific type of diabetes is confirmed. This is advised to be within six to 12 months of the initial diagno sis of diabetes mellitus. This indicator does not specify how the diagnosis is made and a record of the diagnosis will, for the purposes of the QOF, be regarded as sufficient evidence of diabetes. However, there are a substantial number of patients with di abetes who remain undiagnosed and also a number of patients receiving treatment with an incorrect diagnosis of diabetes. Contractors are therefore encouraged to adopt a systematic approach to the diagnosis of diabetes. The World Health Organisation (WHO) 2 00626 states that fasting plasma glucose 7.0 mmol/l (126 mg/dl) or 2 -h plasma glucose 11.1 mmol/l (200 mg/dl) is used as criteria for diagnosing diabetes. In 2011 an addendum to the 2006 WHO diagnostic criteria was published to allow the use of glycated haemo globin (HbA1c) in diagnosing DM .27 The addendum does not invalidate the 2006 recommendations on the use of plasma glucose measurements to diagnose diabetes. The WHO recommend that HbA1c can be used as a diagnostic test for diabetes, provided that stri ngent quality assurance tests are in place and assays are standardised to criteria aligned to the international reference values and there are no conditions present that preclude its accurate measurement. An HbA1c of 48 mmol/mol (6.5 per cent) is recommend ed as the cut - off point for diagnosing diabetes. A value less than 48 mmol/mol (6.5 per cent) does not exclude diabetes diagnosed using glucose tests. The WHO expert group concluded that there is currently insufficient evidence to make any formal recommend ation on the interpretation of HbA1c levels below 48 mmol/mol (6.5 per cent). The use of HbA1c for diagnosing diabetes can avoid the problem of day -to-day variability of glucose values and importantly it avoids the need for the patient to make preceding di etary preparations (such as fasting or consuming a glucose drink). The WHO also recommends that the diagnosis of diabetes in an asymptomatic patient is not made on the basis of a single abnormal plasma glucose or HbA1c value. At least one additional HbA1c or pla sma glucose test result with a value in the diabetic range is required, either fasting, from a random (casual) sample, or from an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The Business Rules include a clinical code for \"diabetes in remission\". Successful management of diabetes with lifestyle, medication, pancreatic or islet cell transplant and/or bariatric surgery may result in glucose levels falling below those diagnostic of diabetes. However, these people may still experience the macrovascular and microva scular complications of diabetes and therefore need continued monitoring. Experts from the diabetes classification working group have endorsed the use of this code for people where treatment has normalised hyperglycaemia but still require continued monitor ing. 26 WHO. Definition and diagnosis of DM and intermediate hyperglycaemia. 2006. www.who.int/diabetes/publications/Definition%20and%20diagnosis%20of%20diabetes_new.pdf 27 WHO. Use of HbA1c in the diagnosis of DM. Abbreviated repor t of a WHO consultation. 2011. www.who.int/diabetes/publications/report -hba1c_2011.pdf 42 Practices should review their patient records and re -code patients previously coded as \"diabetes resolved\" as \"diabetes in remission\" if they still require monitoring for the reasons outlined above. DM 017.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria. Verification - Commissioners may require randomly selecting a number of patient records of patients coded with the parent term 'diabetes mellitus' and requesting information abou t how long the specific diagnosis has been unknown. Commissioners may require contractors to demonstrate that they have processes in place to ensure that patient records are updated once a specific diagnosis has been made. Good practice is that this occur s within six to 12 months of the initial diagnosis. DM indicator 006 (NICE 2015 menu ID: NM95) The percentage of patients with diabetes, on the register, with a diagnosis of nephropathy (clinical proteinuria) or micro -albuminuria who are currently treated with an ACE -I (or ARBs) DM 006.1 Rationale NICE guidelines28 29 recommend the use of ACE -I (or ARBs) to slow the progression of renal disease in patients with diabetes and trial evidence suggests that these are most effective when given in the maximum dose quoted in the BNF. Although trial evidence is based largely on ACE -I, it is believed that similar benefits occur from treatment with ARBs in patients who are intolerant of ACE -I. It is recommended that patients with a diagnosis of micro -albuminuria or prote inuria are commenced on an ACE -I or considered for treatment with ARBs.

DM indicator 014 (NICE 2011 menu ID: NM27) The percentage of patients newly diagnosed with diabetes, on the register, in the preceding 1 April to 31 March who have a record of being referred to a structure d education programme within 9 months after entry on to the diabetes register DM 014.1 Rationale Diabetes is a progressive long -term medical condition that is predominantly managed by the person with the diabetes and/or their carer as part of their daily life. Accordingly, understanding of diabetes, informed choice of management options and the acquisition of relevant skills for successful self -management play an important role in achieving optimal outcomes. These needs a re not always fulfilled by conventi onal clinical consultations. Structured educational (SE) programmes have been designed not only to improve people's knowledge and skills, but also to help motivate and sustain people with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes i n taking control of their condition and in delivering effective self -management. The indicator requires that SE is offered (preferably through a group education programme) to every person with diabetes and/or their carer from the time of diagnosis, with an nual reinforcement and review. An a lternative education programme of equal standard may be offered to people unable or unwilling to participate in group education sessions. From the start of 2021/22 , there is expected to be a phased roll -out of the Healthy Living in Diabetes Programme (HeLP). Referral to this programme will also meet the criteria for this indicator. This indicator suggests referral to a programme within nine months of entry onto the diabetes register to be appropriate for people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. A timeframe of nine months for this indicator has been set to take into account the differing expectations for referral into SE programmes from diagnosis for people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. DM 014.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria. For measurement purposes, nine months is defined as 279 days. Where services are not available locally, practices would be expected to discuss this with the CCG and encourage the commissioning of the relevant services. This may take some time so practices may wish to consider whether it would be appropriate to offer the serv ice in -house, or to services available in different CCGs or neighbouring practices etc. 30 NICE NG19 Diabetic foot proble ms: prevention and management 2015 updated 2019. http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/NG19/ 44 DM indicator 019 (NICE 2018 menu ID: NM159 ) The percentage of patients with diabetes, on the register, without moderate or severe frailty in whom the last blood pressure reading (measured in the preceding 12 months) is 140/80 mmHg or less DM019.1 Rationale Lowering blood pressure in people w ith diabetes reduces the risk of developing micro and macrovascular complications. Applying universal BP targets to all people with diabetes may inadvertently lead to the potential for undertreatment in those with less complex need and overtreatment in those with complex needs and co -morbidity .31 This indicator focuses on blood pressure management in people with diabetes without moderate or severe frailty and thus aims to reduce potential undertreatment and support better control of biomedical targets in p eople with the greatest capacity to benefit. Contractors should note that the BP target in this indicator is higher than that recommended for patients with Type 1 diabetes in NG17, where they should be aiming for 135/85mmHg or 130/80mmHg if the person has albuminuria or two or more features of metabolic syndrome. It is also a lower target than that recommended for patients with type 2 diabetes. Contractors should use their clinical judgement when setting individual blood pressure targets, particularly for people aged 80 years and over.

Rising levels of HbA1c increase the risk of mortality and developing macrovascular and microvascular complic ations. However, applying universal target levels regardless of comorbidities may inadvertently lead to over -treatment, especially in older peopl e with type 2 diabetes.32 This indicator allows for an individualised management approach that adjusts care according to an individual's frailty status. It aims to enable patients without moderate or severe frailty to benefit from tighter glycaemic control . Whilst the target in this indicator is higher than those presented in 31 Kearney et al.

It aims to reduce complications and improve quality of life for peo ple with moderate or severe frailty. NICE guidelines recommend that individualised HbA1c targets should be agreed with people with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes which consider factors such as their daily activities, aspirations, likelihood of complicatio ns, comorbidities and occupation. Individual targets, even for people with moderate or severe frailty , should be lower than the level specified in this indicator. The target in this indicator has been pragmatically selected as a level that HbA1c should not go beyond in order to avoid people becoming symptomatic of hyperglycaemia.

The NICE guideline for cardiovascular disease risk assessment and lipid modification35 recommends that people with type 1 diabetes are offered statin treatment for primary prevention when they are older than 40 years, or they have had diabetes for more than 10 years, or they have established nephropathy or other CVD risk factors. People wit h type 2 diabetes should be offered statin therapy if they have a 10% or greater 10 -year risk of developing CVD, estimated using the QRISK2 assessment tool. 33 NICE NG17 Type 1 diabetes in adults: diagnosis and management 2015 updated 2016 http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/NG17 34 NICE NG28 Type 2 diabetes in adults: management 2015 updated 2019 www.nice.org.uk/guidance/NG28 35 NICE CG181 Cardiovascular disease: risk assessment and reduction, including lipid modification 2014 updated 2016 https://www.nice.or g.uk/guidance/cg181 46 In September 2016, the NICE guideline for cardiovascular risk assessment and lipid modification was amended and reinforced its recommendation of high-intensity statin treatment, for primary prevention prevention (atorvastatin 80mg). a nd verification See indicator wording for requiremen t criteria. People with type 2 diabetes who have a less than 10% 10 -year risk of developing CVD recorded in the preceding 3 years will be excluded from the denominator for this indicator. DM indicator 023 (NICE 2018 menu ID: NM163) The percentage of patients with diabetes and a history of cardiovascular disease (excluding haemorrhagic stroke) who are currently treated with a statin DM023.1 Rationale The NICE guideline for cardiovascular disease risk as sessment and lipid modification35 recommends that high intensity statin therapy be considered for the secondary prevention of CVD. Stain therapy helps to lower levels of low -density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and is associated with a reduction in MI, c oronary heart disease and stroke. Treatment should start with atorvastatin 80mg, however there are situations in which a lower dose should be used.

AST indicator 005 (based on NM165) The contractor establishes and maintains a register of patients with asthma aged 6 years or over, excluding patients with asthma who have been prescribed no asthma related drugs in the preceding 12 months AST 005.1 Rationale The diagnosis of asthma is a clinical one; there is no confirmatory diagnostic blood test, radiological investigation or histopathological investigation. In most patients, the diagnosis can be corroborated by suggestive changes in lung function tests. One of the main difficulties in asthma is the variable and intermittent nature of asthma. Some of the symptoms of asthma are shared with diseases of other systems. Features of an airway disorder in adults such as cough, wheeze and breathlessness should be corroborated where possible by measurement of airflow limitation and reversibility. Obstructive airways disease produces a decrease in peak expiratory flow (PEF) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) but which persist after bronchodilators have been administered. One or both of these should be measured, but may be normal if the measureme nt is made between episodes of bronchospasm. If repeatedly normal in the presence of symptoms, then a diagnosis of asthma is in doubt. 48 A proportion of patients with COPD will also have asthma , e.g. they have large reversibility - 400mls or more on FEV 1 - but do not return to over 80 per cent predicted and have a significant smoking history . These patients will be recorded on both the asthma and COPD registers. Children A definitive diagnosis of asthma can be difficult to obtain in young children. Asthma is to be suspected in any child with wheezing, ideally heard by a health professional on auscultation and distinguished from upper airway noises. In school children, bronchodilator responsiveness, PEF variability or tests of bronchial hyperactivity may be used to confirm the diagnosis, with the same reservations as above. Focus the initial assessment in children suspected of having asthma on the: presence of key features in the history and examination careful consideration of alternativ e diagnoses. It is well recognised that asthma is a variable condition and many patients will have periods when they have minimal symptoms. It is inappropriate to attempt to monitor symptom -free patients on no therapy or very occasional therapy. This produces a significant challenge for the QOF. It is important that resources in primary care are targeted to patients with the greatest need - in this instance, patients who will benefit from asthma review rather than insistence that all patients with a diagnostic label of asthma are reviewed on a regular basis. It is for this reason that the asthma register is constructed annually by searching for patients with a history of asthma, excluding those who have had no prescription for asthma -related drugs in the preceding 12 months. Further information - SIGN guideline 158. SIGN and BTS. British guideline on the management of asthma. 2016 .36 NICE guideline NG80: Asthma: diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management .37 AST 005.2 Reporting and verifica tion See indicator wording for requirement criteria. Part of the register criteria for asthma is based on appropriate prescribing of therapies. From October 2014, the Business Rules were updated to exclude drug therapies licensed only for use in patients w ith a diagnosis of COPD as they are not licensed as a treatment for asthma. Patients with asthma whose sole asthma medication is one associated with COPD will no longer appear on the QOF asthma register. Patients receiving additional, appropriate asthma treatment such as short -acting bronchodilators or steroid inhalers will remain on the register. Practices may wish to review the records of any patients affected by this change to review their asthma treatment however, a change 36 https://www.sign.ac.uk/our -guidelines/british -guideline -on-the-management -of-asthma/ 37 Overview | Asthma: diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management | Guidance | NICE 49 in pres cribing should only b e done where clinically appropriate. AST indicator 00 6 (based on NM166) The percentage of patients with a diagnosis of asthma on or from 1 April 2021 with either: 1. a record of spirometry and one other objective test (FeNO or reversibility or variability) between 3 months before or 6 months after diagnosis; or 2. If newly registered in the preceding 12 months with a diagnosis of asthma recorded on or after 1 April 2021 but no record of objective tests being performed at the date of registration, w ith a record of spirometry and one other objective test (FeNO or reversibility or variability) recorded within 6 months of registration. AST 006.1 Rationale The aim of this indicator is to encourage use of objective tests to confirm asthma diagnosis, and subsequently improve accuracy of diagnosis and reduce incidences of patients receiving inappropriate care. This will mean that some patients may require referral to a specialist service for the necessary diagnostic tests to be completed. Results of testin g should inform subsequent treatment for people with asthma and lead to improved health and wellbeing. Spirometry is the key inv estigation for distinguishing obstructive and restrictive respiratory conditions and will determine subsequent investigations .38 It is crucial that diagnostic spirometry is performed to published quality standards39,40 and therefore referral to a specialist service may be required . Adults (aged 17 and over) should be diagnosed, if they have symptoms suggestive of asthma and: a FeNO level of 40 parts per billion (ppb) or more with either positive bronchodilator reversibility or positive peak flow variability or bronchial hyperreactiv ity, or a FeNO level between 25 and 39 ppb and a positive bronchial challenge test, or positive bronchodilator reversibility and positive peak flow variability irrespective of FeNO level.41 39 Levy ML, Quanjer PH, Booker R, Cooper BG, Holmes S, Small I.

If an adult, young per son or child with symptoms suggestive of asthma cannot perform a particular test, try to perform at least 2 other objective tests. Diagnose suspected asthma based on symptoms and any positive objective test results. More specialist assessment may be requir ed in those in whom the diagnosis is still unclear, which may include assessment of airway inflammation (e.g. nitric oxide measurement), bronchial hyper -responsiveness testing and consideration of alternative diagnoses. It is recommended that children with combined food allergy and asthma and any patient with late onset asthma where there is a suspicion of an occupational cause are referred for specialist assessment. If another diagnosis is more likely If an alternative diagnosis is suspected, investigation and management are to follow guidelines for that condition. Further information about the diagnosis of asthma is provided in the National Guideline Asthma: diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management.42 Co-morbidity: asthma and COPD A proportion of patients with asthma will have both asthma and COPD , e.g. they have airway obstruction that does not reverse to normal but also have substantial reversibility .43 AST 006.2 reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirem ent crit eria.

The most effective treatment is smoking cessation. Oxygen therapy has been shown to prolong life in the later stages of the dis ease and has also been shown to have a beneficial impact on exercise capacity and mental state. Some patients respond to inhaled steroids. Many patients respond symptomatically to inhaled beta -agonists and anti - cholinergics. Pulmonary rehabilitation has been shown to produce an improvement in quality of life. The majority of patients with COPD are managed by GPs and membe rs of the primary care team with onward referral to secondary care when required. This indicator set focuses on the diagnosis and management of patients with symptomatic COPD. COPD indicator 00 9 (based on NM169) The contractor establishes and maintains a register of: 1. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of COPD before 1 April 2021 and 2. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of COPD on or after 1 April 2021 whose diagnosis has been confirmed by a quality assured post bronchodilator spirometry FEV1/FVC ratio below 0.7 between 3 months before or 6 months after diagnosis (or if newly registered in the preceding 12 months a record of an FEV 1/FVC ratio below 0.7 recorded within 6 months of registration); and 3. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of COP D on or after 1 April 2021 who are unable to undertake spirometry COPD 00 9.1 Rationale The aim of this indicator is to encourage practices to maintain a register of patients with a diagnosis of COPD and to use that register of patients to inform the care they deliver, including objective testing to support diagnosis of COPD as recommended in NICE guidance NG115: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in over 16s: diagnosis and management .50 Linking diagnosis and objective testing to entry onto the QOF COPD disease register aims to contribute towards a reduction in both misdiagnosis and the risk of overtreatment in people with COPD. Referral to a specialist service may be appropriate for objective testing and to make an accurate diagnosis. COPD 00 9.2 Reportin g and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria. Patients with clinical diagnoses of COPD and no record of objective tests will not be excluded from the register but the expectation is that, over time, the proportion of patients with spirometry in the diagnostic range will increase relative to those without spirometry recorded. Where patients have co -existing COPD and asthma they will be included on both disease registers. Approximately 15 per cent of patients with COPD will also have asthma. 50NICE NG115.

Understanding the frequency of exacerbations can help wh en creating personalized management plans, identifying triggers and avoiding future exacerbations. In making assessments of the patient's condition as part of an annual review and when considering management changes, it is essential that health care profes sionals record : number of exacerbations the degree of breathlessness (Medical Research Council [ MRC] dyspnoea scale). A tool such as the COPD Assessment Test (CAT) could be used to assess current health status. Additionally, there is evidence that inhaled therapies can improve the quality of life in some patients with COPD. However, there is evidence that patients require training in inhaler technique and that such training requires reinforcement. Where a patient is prescribed an inhaled therapy, th eir technique is to be assessed during any review. The MRC dyspnoea scale gives a measure of breathlessness and is recommended as part of the regular review. It is available in the NICE guideline on COPD, section 1.1, diagnosing COPD table one.

COPD 008.1 Rationale Pulmonary rehabilitation is a multidisciplinary programme of care which aims to reduce disability and improve quality of life in patients with a chronic respiratory impairment. It is individually tailored and designed to optimise each patient's physical and social performance and independence. 55 The NICE guideline for COPD51 recommends that pulmonary rehabilitation should be offered to all patients who consider themselves to be functionally disabled due to their COPD (usually MRC dyspnoea scale score of 3 ). Whilst most patients are likely to benefit, a rehabilitation programme is not suitable for patients who are unable to walk, have unstable angina or who have recently had a myocardial infarction. Medical management should be optimised before referral. COPD 008.2 reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria.

However, it is also important to include patients where it is inappropriate or not possible to refer to a secondary care provider for a diagnosis and where the GP has made a diagnosis based on their clinical judgement and knowledge of the patient. DEM 001.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria. DEM indicator 004 (NICE 2015 menu ID: NM107) The percentage of patients diagnosed with dementia whose care plan has been reviewed in a face -to-face review in the preceding 12 months DEM 004.1 Rationale The NICE guideline for dementia54 recommends agreeing care plans with health and social services for people who have dementia, and having formal reviews at agreed frequencies Where a patient does not already have a care plan or an advanced care plan in place, it is expected that the pract ice will develop a care plan. The face -to-face care plan or advanced care plan review focuses on support needs of the patient and their carer. Regular review can help ensure that any changes in need can be addressed. In particular the review should address the following key issues: an appropriate physical, mental health and social review for the patient, a record of the patients' wishes for the future, communication and co -ordination arrangements with secondary care (if applicable), identification of the patients' carer(s); and 1. obtain appropriate permissions to authorise the practice to speak directly to the nominated carer(s) and provide details of support services available to the patient and their family, if applicable, the carer's needs 54 NICE NG97 Dementia: assessment, management and support for people living with dementia and their carers.2018. https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng97 57 for informatio n commensurate with the stage of the illness and his or her and the patient's health and social care needs, 2. as appropriate, the carer should be included in the care plan or advanced care plan discussions, 3. if applicable, the impact of caring on the care -giver, 4. offer the carer a health check55 to address any physical and mental health impacts, including signposting to any other relevant services to support their health and wellbeing. The practice will agree with the p atient and their carer, what is to be covered in the review and the duration of the consultati on - where appropriate, extended consultations may take up to 30 minutes .56 Ideally the first such appointment would be within six months of diagnosis. A series of well-designed cohort and case contro l studies have demonstrated that patients with Alzheimer -type dementia do not complain of common physical symptoms, but experience them to the same degree as the general population. Patient assessments therefore include the assessment of any behavioural ch anges caused by: concurrent physical conditions (e.g. joint pain or inter -current infections) new appearance of features intrinsic to the disorder (e.g. wandering) and delusions or hallucinations due to the dementia or as a result of caring behaviour (e .g. being dressed by a carer). Depression could also be considered as it is more common in patients with dementia than those without .57 Patients and carers are to be given relevant information about the diagnosis and source s of help and support (bearing in mi nd issues of confidentiality). Evidence suggests that heal thcare professionals can improve satisfaction for carers by acknowledging and dealing with their distress and providing more information on dementia .58 As the illness progresses, needs may change an d the review may focus more on issues such as respite care. There is good evidence from well -designed cohort studies and case control studies of the benefit of healthcare professionals asking about the impact of caring for a person with dementia and the ef fect this has on the caregiver. It is important to remember that male carers are less likely to complain spontaneously and that the impact of caring is dependent not on the severity of the cognitive impairment but on the presentation of the dementia, for e xample, on factors such as behaviour and affect. If the car er is not registered at the practice, but the GP is concerned about issues raised in the consultation, then with appropriate permissions they can contact the carer's own GP for further support and treatment. 55 Where the carer is registered at a different practic e, the patients practice should inform the patient's carer that they can seek advice from their own practice. 56 The practice should agree with the patient the most suitable length of this for this appointment, this could be provided as two 15 minute appoin tments if this is more appropriate for the patient. 57 Alzheimers society: Apathy, anxiety and depression . al. BMJ 1998; 317: 802 -808 58 As the illness progresses and more agencies are involved, the review could additionally focus on assessing the communication between health and social care and non -statutory sectors as appropriate, to ensure that potentially complex needs are ad dressed. Communication and referral issues highlighted in the review need to be followed up as part of the review process. Further information NICE NG97.

Depression (DEP ) Indicator Points Achievement thresholds Initial management DEP003.The percentage of patients aged 18 or over with a new diagnosis of depression in the preceding 1 April to 31 March, who have been reviewed not earlier than 10 days after and not later than 56 days after the date of diagnosis (based on NM50 ) 10 45-80% DEP - rationale for inclusion of the indicator set Depression is common and disabling. In 2012, the estimated prevalence for a depressive episode among people aged 16 or over and un der the age of 74 in England was 2.5 per cent. If the broader and less specific category of 'mixed depression and anxiety' is included, these figures 59 increase dramatically to 8.9 per cent .59 60. It contributes 12 per cent of the total burden of non-fatal global disease and by 2020, looks set to be second after CVD in terms of the world's disabling diseases .61 Major depressive disorder is increasingly seen as chronic and relapsing, resulting in high levels of personal disability, lost quality of life for patients, their family and carers, multiple morbidity, suicide, higher levels of service use and many associ ated economic costs. In 2007 , the total cost of depression in England was reported to be \u00a37.5 billion of which health service costs comprised \u00a31.7 billion and lost earnings \u00a35.8 billion. When the cost of informal care, lower productivity and other public s ector costs are included this figure is estimated at between \u00a320.2 -23.8 billion a year .62 DEP indicator 003 (based on NICE 2012 menu ID: NM50) The percentage of patients aged 18 or over with a new diagnosis of depression in the preceding 1 April to 31 Marc h, who have been reviewed not earlier than 10 days after and not later than 56 days after the date of diagnosis DEP 003.1 Rationale The NICE guideline on depression in adults63 states that patients with mild depression or sub -threshold symptoms be reviewed and re -assessed after initial presentation, normally within two weeks . It recommends that patients with mild or moderate depression who start antidepressants are reviewed after one week if they are considered to present an increased risk of suicide or af ter two weeks if they are not considered at increased risk of suicide. Patients are then re -assessed at regular intervals determined by their response to treatment and whether or not they are considered to be at an increased risk of suicide. This indicator promotes a single depression review between ten and 56 days inclusive after the date of diagnosis. For some patients this may not be their first review as they will have been reviewed initially within a week of the diagnosis. Unless a patient's symptoms h ave resolved, further reviews may be required. When assessing a person who may have depression, conduct a comprehensive assessment that does not rely simply on a symptom count. Take into account both the degree of functional impairment and/or disability associated with the possible depression and the duration of the episode. 59 NICE CG90.

DEP 003.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wordin g for requirement criteria. Those patients whose ongoing care is being provided by specialist mental health services may have a personalised care adjustment applied . It is recommended that where the diagnosis is made by specialist mental health services a nd the patient has been discharged for follow -up by the primary care team, the contractor should find out the diagnosis date in order to record this and invite the patient for a review within the timeframe specified. Suspected depression seen in secondary care may not always be referred to specialist mental health services for further assessment and management. It may be in the form of a discharge letter from an acute medical or surgical ward, A&E or from an outpatient appointment. It may be reasonable in t hese circumstances for a contractor to contact the patient to ask them to attend for an assessment to assess if they have a clinical diagnosis of depression. The register for the purpose of calculating the APDF is defined as all patients aged 18 or over, diagnosed on or after 1 April 2006, who have an unresolved record of depression in their patient record.

For many patients with mental health problems, the most important aspects of care quality relate to the interpersonal skills of the doctor, the time given in consultations and the opportunity to discuss a range of management options. This indicator set focuses on patients with severe mental illness (SMI) . There are separate indicator sets that focus on patients with depression and dementia. NICE CG17864 recommends primary care utilise registers to monitor the physical health of patients with psychosis or schizophrenia. NICE CG18565 recommends that patients with bipolar affective disorder have a physical health review, normally in primary care, performed at least annually, including the following health checks: weight or BMI, diet, nutritional status and level of physical activity cardiovascular status, including pulse and blood pressure 64 NICE CG178.

For 2021/22, QOF will include all six elements of the comprehensive annual physical health check for patients with schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder and other psychoses as defined in the NHS Long Term Plan. In addition to lifestyle factors, such as smoking, poor diet and lack of exercise, antipsychotic drugs vary in their liability for metabolic side effects such as weight gain, lipid abnormalities and disturbance of glucose regulation. Specifically, they increase the risk of the metabolic sy ndrome, a recognised cluster of features (hypertension, central obesity, glucos e intolerance or insulin resistance or dyslipidaemia) which is a predictor of type 2 diabetes and CHD .66 Due to the combination of lifestyle factors and side effects of antipsyc hotic medication, there is a high incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) causing premature death in people with SMI (15 years for bipolar disorder and 25 years for schizophrenia). The aim of the comprehensive annual physical health check is to identify and address risk factors for CVD .67 Further information NICE guidance (CG178) Psychosis and schizophrenia in adults: prevention and management 2014 https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg178/chapter/recommendations#how -to-use- antipsychotic -medication Practices may wish to utilise the Lest er tool; a mental health physical review template https://www.tpp -uk.com/mhpr MH indicator 001 The contractor establishes and maintains a register of patients with schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder and ot her psychoses and other patients on lithium therapy MH 001.1 Rationale The register includes all patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder and other psychoses and other patients on lithium therapy.

Making an accurate diagnosis of remission for a patient with a dia gnosis of severe mental illness can be challenging an d the evidence base to support when to use the 'remission code' is largely based on clinical judgement. A longitudinal international study of recovery from psychotic illnesses found that as many as 56 pe r cent of patients recovered from psychotic illnesses to some extent, although only 16 per cent recover if a more stringent concept of recovery68 is used. In the absence of strong evidence of what constitutes 'remission' from severe mental illness, it is a dvised that clinicians should only consider using the remission codes if the patient has been in remission for at least five years, that is where there is: no record of antipsychotic medication, no mental health in -patient episodes; and no secondary or community care mental health follow -up for at least five years. Where a patient is recorded as being 'in remission' they remain on the register (in case their condition relapses at a later date) but they are excluded from the denominator for s ubsequent indicators. The accuracy of this diagnosis and the coding should be reviewed on an annual basis by a GP. If a patient who has been coded as 'in remission' experiences a relapse then this should be recorded as such in their patient record. In the event that a patient experiences a relapse and is coded as such, they will once again be included in all the associated indicators for schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder and other psychoses. MH 001.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria. Verification - Commissioners may require randomly selecting a number of patient records in which a 'remission code' has been recorded and r equest evidence as to why it was appropriate for that patient to be considered 'in remission' and to confirm the ongoing accuracy of this coding. Contractors may be expected to demonstrate they have a protocol to guide their clinicians as to how this would work and who would be suitable to make the decision. It would not be appropriate for non -clinical members of the practice to make the decision as to when to enter this code. 68 Harrison G, Hopper K, Craig T, Laska E, Siegel C, Wanderling J et al.

This consultation may include the views of their relative(s) or carer(s) where appropriate. Up to half of patien ts who have a severe mental illness are seen only in a primary care setting. For these patients, it is important that the primary care team takes responsibility for discussing and documenting a care plan in their primary care record. When constructing the primary care record, research supports the inclusion of the following information: patient's current health status and social care needs including how needs are to be met, by whom and the patient's expectations how socially su pported the individual is: e. g. friendships/family contacts/voluntary sector organisation involvement. co-ordination arrangements with secondary care and/or mental health services and a summary of what services are actually being received occupational sta tus - for people being supported by secondary mental health services in England, there is a 65% employment gap compared with the general population .70 Studies show a clear interest in work and employment activities among users of mental health services with up to 90 per cent wishing to go into or back to work .71 'Early warning signs' from the patient's perspective that may indicate a possible relapse .72 Many patients may already be aware of their early warning signs (or relapse signature) but it is important for the primary care team to also be aware of noticeable changes in thoughts, perceptions, feelings and behaviours leading up to their mos t recent episode of illness as well as any events the patient thinks may have acted as triggers . the patient's preferred course of action (discussed when well) in the event of a clinical relapse, including who to contact and wishes around medication. 69 NICE CG178.

MH indicator 003 ( based on NM17) The percentage of patients with schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder and other psychoses who have a record of blood pressure in the preceding 12 months MH 003.1 Rationale Patients with schizophrenia have mortality between two and three times that of the general population and most of the excess deaths are from diseases that are the major causes of death in the general population. A prospective record linkage study of the mortality of a c ommunity cohort of 370 patients with schizophrenia found that the increased mortality risk is probably life -long and it suggested that cardiovascular mortality of schizophrenia has increased over the past 25 years relative to the general population .73 The NICE guideline on bipolar disorder also states that the standardised mortality ratio for cardiovascular death may be twice that of the general population but appears to be reduced if patients adhere to long -term medication. Hypertension in people with schi zophrenia is estimated at 19 per cent compared with 15 per cent in the general population .74 A cross -sectional study of 4310 patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2001 receiving care at veterans' administration facilities found a prevalence of hypert ension of 35 per cent .75 There is evidence to suggest that physical conditions such as cardiovascular disorders go unrecognised in psychiatric patients. A direct comparison of cardiovascular screening (blood pressure , lipid levels and smoking status) of pa tients with asthma, patients with schizophrenia and ot her attendees indicated that general practice were less likely to screen patients with schizophrenia for cardiovascular risk compared with the other two groups .76 73 Brown S, Kim M, Mitchell C et al. 25 year mortality of a community cohort with schizophrenia.

MH 003.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria. MH indicator 006 ( based on NM16) The percentage of patients with schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder and other psychoses who have a record of BMI in the preceding 12 months MH006.1 Rationa le As noted above, people with serious mental illness are at increased risk of premature and preventable cardiovascular mortal ity and morbidity when compared to the general population. Obesity is a key risk factor linked to this. when compared to the general population people with psychosis lead more sedentary lives, eat less fruit and vegetables, are more likely to be obese and to smoke. In addition to these lifestyle factors, antipsychotic drugs vary in their liability for metabolic side effects such as weight gain, lipid abnormalities and disturbance of glucose regulation. Specifically, they increas e the risk of metabolic syndr ome, a recognised cluster of features (hypertension, central obesity, glucose intolerance or insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia), which is a predictor of type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease. About 40% of people with sc hizophrenia are obese and obesity is also common in people with bipolar disorders. NICE Guidelines CG17877 and CG18578 recommend annual weight monitoring in this patient group. MH006.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria. MH indicator 007 (based on NM15 ) The percentage of patients with schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder and other psychoses who have a record of alcohol consumption in the preceding 12 months. MH 007.1 Rationale Substance misuse by people with schizoph renia is increasingly recognised as a major problem, both in terms of its prevalence and its clinical and social effects .79 The National Psychiatric Morbidity Survey in England found that 16 per cent of people with schizophrenia were drinking over the reco mmended limits of 21 units of 77 NICE CG 178 Psychosis and schizophrenia in adults: prevention and management. 2014. http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg178 78 NICE CG185 Bipolar disorder: assessment and management. 2014 updated 2018 http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg185 79 RCP Research and Training Unit.

The rates of type 1 diabetes are about the same as the general population, although the overall numbers are small. People with SMI are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes earlier than the general population, frequently in the fourth and fifth decades. People with SMI are more likely to develop type 1 diabet es later than those without a SMI, as late as the third and fourth decades of life .87 MH 012.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria.

Br J Psychiatry 192(6):406 -411. 87 https://bjgp.org/content/68/669/166#xref -ref-4-1 69 CAN - rationale for inclusion of indicator set It is recognised that the principal active management of cancers occurs in the secondary care setting. However, general practice often has a key role in the referral and subsequent support of these patients and in ensuring that care is appropriately co-ordinated. This indicator set is not evidence -based but does represent good professional practice. The introduction of the new and updated indicators for cancer aim s to increase the personalisation of cancer care and the timing of the cancer care review. CAN indicator 001 The contractor establishes and maintains a register of all cancer patients defined as a 'register of patients with a diagnosis of cancer excluding non -melanotic skin cancers diagnosed on or after 1 April 2003' CAN 001.1 Rationale The regist er can be developed prospectively as the intention is to ensure appropriate care and follow -up for patients with a diagnosis of cancer. For the purposes of the register all cancers are included except non -melanomatous skin lesions. CAN 001.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria. CAN indicator 005 (based on NM204) The percentage of patients with cancer, diagnosed within the preceding 12 months, who have had the opportunity for a discussion and been informed of the support available from primary care, within 3 months of diagnosis. CAN 005.1 Rationale Most practices will see patients with a new cancer diagnosis following assessment and management in a secondary or tertiary care setting. This indicator aims to encourage GP practices to proactively provide patients with the opportunity for a discussion to make them aware of the support available from their GP and wider practice team. The intention is to facilitate early and supportive conversations and ensure patients are aware of what help is available. This indicator supports recommendations 1.1.1, 1.3. 4 and 1.3.5 from NICE guideline CG138 Patient experience in adult NHS services .88 CAN 005.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria. This indicator will only apply to patients who have received their diagnosis on or aft er 1 April 2021. For the purposes of this indicator, the 12-month timeframe starts from the date of diagnosis irrespective of whether or not the diagnosis was made in primary care. 88 https://www.nice.org.uk/guid ance/cg138/chapter/1 -Guidance 70 CAN indicator 004 (NICE menu 2020 ID: NM205) The percentage of patients wi th cancer, diagnosed within the preceding 24 months, who have a patient Cancer Care Review using a structured template recorded as occurring within 12 months of the date of diagnosis CAN 004.1 Rationale A GP will have an average of eight or nine new cancer diagnoses per year and will be looking after 20 to 30 patients with cancer. The increasing number of cancer survivors has led to an increase in the number of people requiring follow -up care, monitoring and management . Therefore primary care has an importa nt role in supporting people to live well with and beyond cancer. This review represents an opportunity to address patients' needs for individual assessment, care planning and ongoing support and information requirements. The Cancer Care Review should be a holistic conversation that covers clinical, practical, emotional, psychological and financial (where appropriate) aspects of the person's cancer care. The review should also consider the co -ordination of care between sectors. Practices should use Macmilla n's national, integrated electronic CCR template within their Primary Care IT system to support a well -structured review. Further information on how to access Macmillan's CCR templates on all major GP IT systems can be found on the Macmillan website .89 This template can be used as an aide memoire when carrying out a CCR. It also includes supporting information which can be shared with the patient as well as providing a helpful coded record of topics discussed. Macmillan also provides Top Tips on Cancer Car e Reviews90 which encourages a fuller discussion of the diagnosis and recording of cancer therapy, an offer of relevant information, medication review, benefits counselling and recording of a carer's details. Top Tips on Late Effects, Fatigue, Anxiety, Nut rition and other common problems are also available .91 Further information on care following a cancer diagnosis and the potential role for primary care can be found on the Macmillan website .92 CAN 004.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria. For the purposes of this indicator, the 12-month timeframe starts from the date of diagnosis irrespective of whether or not the diagnosis was made in primary care. This indicator will not include patients w hose latest unresolved cancer diagnosis was earlier than 1 January 2021 as these patients should have already been reviewed. 89 -professionals/innovation -for-gps.html 71 Verification - Commissioners may wish to review records where a review is claimed to confirm that the review has been completed usi ng a structured template within 12 months of diagnosis. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) Indicator Points Achievement thresholds Records CKD005. The contractor establishes and maintains a register of patients aged 18 or over with CKD with classification of categories G3a to G5 (previously stage 3 to 5) (NICE 201 4 menu ID: NM83 ) 6 CKD - rationale for inclusion of indicator set NICE CG182 recommends classifying CKD using a combination of GFR and Albumin Creatinine Ratio (ACR) categories as G1 to G5, see description in Table 1. In a cross -sectional point prevalence study93 of over 130,000 adults in England the age standardised prevalence of people with an estimated GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2 (CKD stages 3 -5) was 8.5 per cent. Those with CKD were more likely to have hypertension, diabetes and CVD compared to people with GFR>60 m l/min/1.73 m2, the prevalence of CKD rose with age and female gender. Limited data are available to provide an estimate of the overall population prevalence of CKD (diagnosed and undiagnosed). The available estimate suggests an overall prevalence of 13 per cent. This disease area applie s to patients with CKD (eGFR<60 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2 confirmed with at least two separate readings over a three month period). Late presentation of patients with kidney failure increases morbidity, mo rtality and healthcare associated with costs. The total cost of CKD in England in 2009/10 was estimated as being circa \u00a31.4 billion .94 Early identification of CKD is therefore important to not on ly allow appropriate measures to be taken to slow or prevent the progression to more serious C KD, but also to highlight and manage the key associated risks related to patient safety and avoidable harm. 93 Stevens, P et al. CKD management in the UK: NEOERICA project results. K idney International: 2007. 2 (1) 92 -99 72 Table 1 . Classification of CKD using GFR and ACR categories GFR and ACR categories (including stages of CKD from previous guideline) Albuminuria categories (mg/mmol) Increased risk <3 Normal to mildly increased 3-30 Moderately increased >30 Severely increased A1 A2 A3 GFR categories (ml/min/1.73m2) 290 CKD* G1 A2 G1 A3 60-89 Mild reduction related to normal range for a young adult G2 (stage 2) G2 G5 A3 Increasing risk *By definition, in the absence of evidence of kidney damage, these categories are not CKD ^ Consider using eGFRcystatinC to confirm the diagnosis of CKD in people with eGFRcreatinine of 45 -59 ml/min/1.73m2, sustained for at least 90 days and no proteinuria (ACR less than 3 mg/mmol) CKD indicator 005 (NICE 201 4 menu ID: NM83) The contractor establishes and maintains a register of patients aged 18 or over with CKD with classification of categories G3a to G5 (previously stage 3 to 5) 73 CKD 005.1 Rationale This indicator aims to establish a register of people with CKD c ategories G3a to G5 to enable appropriate advice, treatment and support to be provided for people with moderate to severe CKD and so help preserve kidney function and reduce the risk of developing co -morbidity. Eating a meal containing protein can elevate creatinine, therefore it is recommended that patients do not eat meat in the 1 2 hours before their creati nine is measured and eGFR estimated. CKD 005.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria. Epilepsy (EP) Indicator Points Achievement thresholds Records EP001. The contractor establishes and maintains a register of patients aged 18 or over receiving drug treatment for epilepsy. 1 EP - rationale for inclusion of indicator set Epilepsy is the most common serious neurological conditi on, affecting about five to ten per 1000 of the population at any one time. Few epilepsies are preventable, but appropriate clinical management can enable most patients with epilepsy to lead a full and productive life. For the purposes of the QOF, epilepsy is defined as 'recurrent unprovoked seizures'. EP indicator 001 The contractor establishes and maintains a register of patients aged 18 or over receiving drug treatment for epilepsy EP 001.1 Rationale The disease register includes patients aged 18 or over, as care for younger patients is generally undertaken outside of primary care. The phrase 'receiving treatment' has been included in order to exclude the large number of patients who may have had epilepsy in the past, may have not received treatment and been fit -free for many years. Some patients may still be coded as 'epilepsy' or 'history of epilepsy' and will be picked up on computer searches. Patients with a history of epilepsy who are not on drug therapy are excluded from the register. Drugs on repeat prescription will be picked up on a search. EP 001.2 Reporting a nd verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria. 74 Verification - Commissioners may require a comparison of the expected prevalence with the reported prevalence recognising that reported prevalence will be reduced as the register is limited t o those patients receiving drug treatment. Learning disabilities (LD) Indicator Points Achievement threshol ds Records LD004. The contractor establishes and maintains a register of patients with learning disabilities (NICE 2013 menu ID: NM73 ) 4 LD - rationale for inclusion of indicator set People with learning disabilities are among the most vulnerable and socially excluded in our society. It is estimated that there are approximately 20/1,000 people with mild learning disabilities and 3 -4/1,000 w ith severe and profound learning disabilities in the UK. Over the past three decades, almost all the long -stay NH S beds for people with learning disabilities have closed and virtually all people with learning disabilities are now living in the community and depend on general practice for their primary care needs. Care of patients with a learning disability is a quality improvement topic for 2021/22 . This is detailed in Section 5. LD indicator 004 (NICE 2015 menu ID: NM73) The contractor establis hes and maintains a register of patients with learning disabilities LD 004.1 Rationale This register indicator includes people of any age with a learning disability. This is because without a complete register of people with learning disabilities, practice s may not be aware of the reasonable adjustments that may be needed for a child or young person with learning disabilities and their family, and of the help and support that may be useful to them. Evidence suggests there are an increasing number of childre n with learning disabilities now surviving childhood, some of whom will have profound and multiple disabilities as they grow up .95 It also suggests that health services are often unprepared for these children and young people and the complexity of their pr oblems .96 A full register of patients with learning disabilities will provide primary care practitioners with the first important building block in providing better quality and more appropriate services for this patient population. 95 Emerson, E. Estimating Future Numbers of Adults with Profound learning disabilities in England. 2009 . http://www.eme raldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/13595474200900040?journalCode=tldr 96 Betz, C. Transition of Adolescents with Special Health Care Needs: review and analysis of the literature. 2004. Issues in Comprehensive Paediatric Nursing 27:179 -241 75 Learning disabilities ar e heterogeneous conditions, but are defined by three core criteria: lower intellectual ability (usually defined as an Intelligence Quotient [IQ] of less than 70) or a significantly reduced ability to understand new or complex information; significant impairment of social or adaptive functioning; and onset in childhood. An IQ below 70 should not be used on its own to determine whether someone has a learning disability. The definition encompasses people with a broad range of disabilities. It includes adults with autism who also have learning disabilities, but not people with a higher level autistic spectrum disorder who may be of average or above average intelligence. The definition does not include all those people who have a \"learning difficulty\", e .g. specific difficulties with learning, such as dyslexia. NHS England has published guidance97 aimed at improving the identification of people with a learning disability. Practices should review this guidance and update their re gisters on a regular basis to ensure that they are accurate. It is a statutory requirement under the Equality Act 2010 that public sector agencies make 'reasonable adjustments' to their practice that will make them as accessible and effective as they would be for people without disabilities. Reasonable adjustments include removing physical barriers to accessing health services, but importantly also include making whatever alterations are necessary to policies, procedures, staff training and service delivery to ensure that they work equally well for people with learning disabilities .98 LD 004.2 Reportin g and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria. There was a significant revision of the clinical codes used to create this register in 2019 .

The contractor establishes and maintains a register of patients: 1. Aged 50 or over and who have not attained the age of 75 with a record of a fragility fracture on or after 1 April 2012 and a diagnosis of osteoporosis confirmed on DXA scan, and 2. Aged 75 or over with a record of a fragility fracture on or after 1 April 2014 and a diagnosis of osteoporosis (NICE 2011 menu ID: NM29 ) 3 OST - rationale for inclusion of indicator set Osteoporotic fragility fractures can cause substantial pain and severe disability and are associated with decreased life expectancy. Osteoporotic fragility fractures occur most commonly in the spine (vertebrae), hip (proximal femur) and wrist (distal radius). They also occur in the arm (humerus), p elvis, ribs and other bones. Fractures of the hands and feet (for example metacarpal and metatarsal fractures) are not generally regarded as osteoporotic fragility fractures. Interventions for secondary prevention of fractures in patients who have had an osteoporotic fragility fracture include pharmacological intervention. OST indicator 004 (NICE 2011 menu ID: NM29) The contractor establishes and maintains a register of patients: Aged 50 or over and who have not attained the age of 75 with a record of a fragility fracture on or after 1 April 2012 and a diagnosis of osteoporosis confirmed on DXA scan; and Aged 75 or over with a record of a fragility fracture on or after 1 April 2014 and a diagnosis of osteoporosis . OST 004.1 Rationale Fragility fractures are fractures that result from low -level trauma, which means mechanical forces that would not ordinarily cause fracture. The WHO has described this as a force equivalent to a fall from a standing height or less. Reduced bone density is a major ri sk factor for fragility fractures .99 100 Osteoporosis is a disease characterised by low bone mass and structural deterioration of bone tissue. The WHO defines osteoporosis as a bone mineral density of 2.5 or more standard deviations below that of a normal y oung adult (T - 99 WHO. Guidelines for preclinical evaluation and clinical trial s in osteoporosis. 1998. 100 NICE CG146. Osteoporosis: assessing the risk of fragility fracture. 2017. http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/CG146 77 score of -2.5 or le ss) measured by a central dual -energy X -ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan. Bone mineral density is the major criterion used to diagnose and monitor osteoporosis. NICE guidance on osteoporosis fragility fractures recommends that a diagnosis of osteoporosis may be assumed in women aged 75 or over with a fragility fracture if the responsible clinician considers a DXA scan to be clinically inappropriate or unfeasible .101 The SIGN guideline on the management of osteoporosis102 recommen ds that in frail elderly women (aged 80 or over) a DXA scan would be a prerequisite to establish that bone mass density (BMD) is sufficiently low before starting treatment with bone -sparing agents (bisphosphonates), unless the patient has suffered multiple vertebral fractures. Osteoporotic fragility fractures can cause substantial pain and severe disability and are associated with decreased life expectancy. Osteoporotic fragility fractures occur most commonly in the spine (vertebrae), hip (proximal femur) a nd wrist (distal radius). They also occur in the arm (humerus), pelvis, ribs and other bones. Fractures of the hands and feet (f or example, metacarpal and metatarsal fractures) are not generally regarded as osteoporotic fragility fractures. In women, the p revalence of osteoporosis increases markedly with age after menopause, from approximately two per cent at 50 years, rising to more than 25 per cent at 80 years. The NICE cost impact report for technology appraisal TA161 uses a prevalence of 11 per cent of post-menopausal women aged 50 or over with osteoporosis and a clinically apparent osteoporotic fragility fracture, rising to 19 per cent for ages 65 or over. There are an estimated 180,000 new fragility fractures in postmenopausal women in the UK each year ; three quarters in women aged 65 or over. Postmenopausal women with an initial fracture are at substantially greater risk of subsequent fractures. Half of patients with a hip fracture have previously had a fragility fracture of another bone. Hip fractures are associated with increased mortality; estimates of the relative mortality risk vary from two to greater than ten in the 12 months following hip fracture. However, it is unclear to what exte nd this can be attributed to fracture alone, as opposed to pre -existing co -morbidity. The SIGN guideline recommends that patients who have suffered one or more fragility fractures are priority targets for investigation and treatment of osteoporosis. This indicator promotes structured case finding for osteoporosis in p atients who have had a fragility fracture. Its aim is to promote the secondary prevention of fragility fracture in patients with osteoporosis. 101 NICE technology appraisal osteoporotic fragility fractures in postmenopausal women. 2017. http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/TA161 102 SIGN gu ideline 142. Management of osteoporosis and the prevention of fragility fractures. 2015. https://www.sign.ac.uk/media/1741/sign142.pdf 78 OST 004.2 Reporting and verification The Business Rules for the two -part register will look for the following criteria: In patients aged 50 or over and who have not attained the age of 75: the earliest DXA scan with a positive result of osteoporosis the earliest diagnosis of osteoporosis a fragility fracture at any point on or after the implementation da te (1 April 2012). In patients aged 75 or ove r: the earliest diagnosis of osteoporosis a fragility fracture at any point on or after the implementation date (1 April 2014). Patients aged 50 or over and under the age of 75 in whom a diagnosis of osteoporosis has not been confirmed with DXA scanning will not be included in the register. For patients aged 75 or over the diagnosis of osteoporosis can be either confirmed with DXA scanning or clinically assumed (if DXA scan is considered to be clinically inappropriate or unfeasible). Patients with fragility fractures sustained in the last three months of the year will be excepted from this indicator. Although this indicator defines two separate registers, the disease register for calculating the APDF is defined as the sum of the number of patients on both registers. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) Indicator Points Achievement thresholds Records RA001. The contractor establishes and maintains a register of patients aged 16 or over with rheumatoid arthritis (NICE 2012 menu ID: NM55 ) 1 Ongoing management RA002. The percentage of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, on the register, who have had a face-to-face review in the preceding 12 months (NICE 2012 menu ID: NM58 ) 5 40-90% RA - rationale for inclusion of indicator set Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chro nic, disabling auto -immune disease characterised by inflammation in the peripheral joints, whi ch causes swelling, stiffness, pain and 79 progressive joint destruction. For a small proportion of people with RA, inflammatory disease outside the joints (i .e. eye and lung disease, vasculitis) can pose a significant problem. RA affect s around one per cent of the population; of these people, approximately 15 per cent have severe RA. Although the confirmation of diagnosis and initiation of treatment may take place in secondary care, primary care has an important role to play in the mana gement of RA. This may include checking cardiovascular risk and blood pressure, checking the person's risk for osteoporosis and assessing for signs of low mood or depression. An annual face -to-face review in primary care is an opportunity to assess the eff ect of the disease on the person's life, for example side effects to medication and w hether they would benefit from any referrals to the MDT. RA indicator 001 (NICE 2012 menu ID: NM55) The contractor establishes and maintains a register of patients aged 16 or over with rheumatoid arthritis RA 001.1 Rationale The RA register includes patients aged 16 or over with established and recent -onset disease and in whom there is a definite diagnosis of RA, irrespective of evidence of positive serology and current dis ease activity status. The register is restricted to patients aged 16 or over, to conform to international standards for differentiating RA from juvenile idiopathic arthritis. The register also includes patients with inactive RA. There are three potential groups of patients whose disease may be referred to as inactive: patients who are being treated and whose disease is in remission patients who are not receiving treatment for RA but have evidence of past disease, i.e. joint deformities. Thi s type of RA is sometimes known as 'burnt out' RA. These patients are on the register as they remain at risk of the systemic effects of RA patients who are not receiving treatment for RA who have no evidence of past disease but there is doubt about their d iagnosis. The contractor may wish to request (ESR) or plasma viscosity, C -reactive protein (CRP), rheumatoid factor and hand X -ray to determine the accuracy of the diagnosis. Inaccurate diagnoses can be removed from the patient's patient record which would also remove them from the register. Recognition of synovitis in primary care and prompt referral for specialist advice is key to the early identification and treatment of RA. Synovitis is inflammation of the membrane that lines the inside of synovial join ts (most of the joints in the body). Symptoms of inflammation include pain, swelling, heat and loss of function of an affected joint. Identifying recent -onset RA can be challenging in primary care because of the variety of ways in which synovitis can pres ent itself and the small number of patients who have RA compared with the number of patients with musculoskeletal symptoms. 80 NICE guideline NG100103 recommends that patients with persistent synovitis are referred for specialist opinion. Urgent referral is ne eded when any of the following are present: the small joints of the hands or feet are affected more than one joint is affected there has been a delay of three months or longer between the onset of symptoms and seeking medical advice. Early identification o f recent -onset RA is important because long -term outcomes are improved if disease modifying anti -rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) treatment is started within three months of the onset of symptoms. RA 001.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requi rement criteria. Verification - Commissioners may wish to discuss with contractors the process they use to identify patients with RA, and the number of patients with inactive disease whose diagnoses have been reviewed and the outcomes of this review. RA in dicator 002 (NICE 2012 menu ID: NM58) The percentage of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, on the register, who have had a face-to-face review in the preceding 12 months RA 002.1 Rationale RA is a chronic disease with a variable course over a long period of time. Therefore, there is a need for regular monitoring to determine disease status, assess severity, efficacy and toxicity of drug therapy and identify co -morbidities or complications. Patients with satisfactorily controlled established disease require review appointments for ongoing drug monitoring, additional visits for disease flares and rapid access to specialist care. RA and its treatment can also have a negative effect on a patient's qua lity of life. It is recommended that contractors revie w the following aspects of care with a patient: disease activity and damage, which may include requesting C -reactive protein (CRP) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or plasma viscosity test a discussion of DMARDS, if relevant the need for referral fo r surgery the effect the disease is having on their life, for example employment or education the need to organise appropriate cross -referral within the MDT. As a minimum, it is advised that this review covers disease activity and damage, the effect of the disease on the patient's life and whether they would benefit from any referrals to the MDT . 103 NICE NG100.

Palliative care (PC) Indicator Points Achievement thresholds Records PC001. The contractor establishes and maintains a register of all patients in need of palliative care/support irrespective of age 3 PC - rationale for inclusion of indicator set Palliative or end of life care is the active total care of patients with life -limiting disease and their families by a multi -professional team. The first National End of Life Care (EoLC) Strategy104 was published in July 2008 followed by: the National Palliative and EoLC Partnership.

Timely identification of people in need of this support will be key to making these quality improvements. PC indicator 001 The contractor establishes and maintains a register of all patients in need of palliative care/support irrespective of age PC 001.1 Rationale About one per cent of the population in the UK die each year (over half a million), with an average of 20 deaths per GP per year. A quarter of all deaths are due to cancer, a third from organ failure, a third from frailty or dementia and only one twelfth of patients have a sudden death. It may therefore be possible to predict the majority of deaths; however, this is difficult and errors occur 30 per cent of the time. Two thirds o f errors are based on over optimism and one third on pessimism. However, 104 DH. National EoLC strategy. NHS Long Term Plan. 2019. https://www.longtermplan.nhs.uk 82 the considerable benefits of identifying these patients include providing the best health and social care to both patients and families and avoiding crises, by prioritising them, anticipating need and enabling patients to be able to make informed decisions about the care and supp ort they need. Identifying patients in need of palliative care, assessing their needs and preferences and proactively planning their care, are the key steps in the provision of high quality care at the end of life in general practice. This indicator is foc used on identifying these patients - a critical first step in addressing the key elements of good medical practice identified by the General Medical Council .106 A patient is included on the register if any of the following apply: their death in the next 12 months can be reasonably predicted (rather than trying to predict, clinicians often find it ea sier to ask 'the 'surprise question' - 'Would I be surprised if this patient were still alive in 12 months?') they have advanced or irreversible disease and clinical indicators of progressive deterioration and thereby a need for palliative care , e.g. they have one or more core /general and one disease specific indicator i n accordance with the gold standard framework (GSF) prognostic i ndicators g uidance or the Support ive and Palliative Care Indicators Tool (SPICT) they are entitled to a DS 1500 form (the DS 1500 form is designed to speed up the payment of financial benefits and can be issued when a patient is considered to be approaching the terminal stage of their ill ness. For these purposes, a patient is considered as terminally il l if they are suffering from a progressive disease and are not expected to live longer than six months). The register applies to all patients fulfilling the criteria regardless of age or dia gnosis. The creation of a register will not in itself improve care but it enables the wider practice team to provide more appropriate and patient focussed care. PC 001.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria. There is no APDF calculation in respect of the palliative care indicators. In the rare case of a nil register at year end, if a contractor can demonstrate that it established and maintained a register during the financial year then they will be eligible for payment for PC001. 106 General Medical Council. 2010.

The percentage of patients with non -diabetic hyperglycaemia who have had an HbA1c or fasting blood glucose performed in the preceding 12 months (NICE 2017 menu ID: NM150) 18 50-90% NDH - rationale for inclusion of indicator set NDH is defined as an HbA1c on 42 -47mmol/mol or a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) of 5.5 -6.9mmol/l. There were 1.8 million people with NDH in England in July 2018. The NHS has invested heavily in behavioural interven tions for those with NDH in order to prevent and delay the onset of type 2 diabetes. The Healthier You: NHS Diabetes Prevention Programme (NHS DPP) is the largest undertaking of its kind in the world and over 230,000 people have already benefited since its introduction in 2016. It has proven effective at causing weight loss and reducing HbA1c.107 NDH indicator 001 (NICE 2017 menu ID: NM150) The percentage of patients with non -diabetic hyperglycaemia who have had an HbA1c or fasting blood glucose performed i n the preceding 12 months NDH 001.1 Rationale NICE Guidance (PH38108) recommends that everyone with NDH is offered an annual blood test to check for progression to Type 2 diabetes and indicators are available on the NICE menu to support this activity. Despite this there is wide variation in the monitoring of people with NDH. The aim of this indicator is to promote e arly identification of when people cross the threshold into the type 2 diabetes category , as it is associated with reduced CVD event rate and lower mortality in the individuals identified. Criteria for diagnosing diabetes are discussed in the diabetes section of this guidance. NDH 001.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria. The register for the purpose of calculating the APDF is defined as all patients aged 18 or over with a record of non -diabetic hyperglycaemia or pre -diabetes, which has not been superseded by a diagnosis of diabetes recorded prior to the beginning of the financial year. 107 Diabetologia 2019; 62 (Suppl.1): S89 108 NICE guidance PH38: Type 2 diabetes: prevention in people at high risk https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ph38 84 Section 4: Public Health domain Blood pressure (BP) Indicator Points Achievement thresholds BP002. The percentage of patients aged 45 or over who have a record of blood pressure in the preceding 5 years (based on NM61) 15 50-90% BP indicator 002 ( based on NM61) The percentage of patients aged 45 or over who have a record of blood pressure in the preceding 5 years BP 002.1 Rationale Detecting elevated blood pressure and, where indicated, treating it, is known to be an effective health intervention. Raised blood pressure is common if it is measured on a single occasion but with repeated measurement blood pressure tends to drop. NICE g uideline recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension109 are to be followed by practitioners when dec iding on whether to treat raised blood pressure. The age limit of aged 45 or over, has been chosen as the vast majority of patients develop hypertension after this age . The age range 45 or over, coupled with a five- year reference period is in line with t he NHS Health Checks Scheme , which starts at 40 years old. It is also to align the indicator more closely with the vascular checks programme and the cost -effectiveness modelling undertaken to support that programme. It is anticipated that contractors will o pportunistically check blood pressures in all adult patients. BP 002.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria. Generally, personalised care adjustment criteria (see Section 6) do not apply to this indicator. However, practices are able to remove patients from the denominator where the patient declines to accept offered care. 109 NICE CG 136.

The contractor establishes and maintains a register of patients aged 18 years or over with a BMI 30 in the preceding 12 months (based on NM143) 8 OB - rationale for inclusion of indicator set The Global Burden of Disease study identifies obesity as one of the top five risk factors contributing to premature death in England along with smoking, poor diet, high blood pressure and drug and alcohol use .110 Nearly two -thirds of adults in England are overweight or obese, some of the worst figures in Europe .111 As noted in the NHS Long Term Plan obesity is linked with type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, increased rates of respiratory, musculoskeletal and liver disease and certain types of cancer. The NHS Long Term Plan commits to a targeted offer of suppo rt and access to weight management services in primary care for people with a diagnosis of hypertension or type 2 diabetes with a BMI >30, amongst other actions to reduce obesity. Further information NICE has produced multiple guidelines on clinical and p ublic health approaches to tacking obesity, they can be accessed via the NICE Obesity Pathway https://pathways.nice.org.uk/pathways/obesity OB indicator 002 The contractor establishes and maintains a register of patients aged 18 years or over with a BMI 30 in the preceding 12 months OB 002.1 Rationale The register includes all patients whose BMI has been recorded by the practice as part of routine care. It is expected that this data will inform public health planning and support onward referral to weight management services . NICE guideline CG189112 recommends using BMI as a practical estimate of adiposity in adults. Identifying people with a BMI 25 includes a preventative aspect of care in managing obesity and supports interventions for people at risk of obesity , i.e. those who are overweight but n ot yet obese. 110 Steel et al.

The percentage of patients with any or any combination of the following conditions: CHD, PAD, stroke or TIA, hypertension, diabetes, COPD, CKD, asthma, schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder or other psychoses whose notes record smoking status in the preceding 12 months (NICE 2011 menu ID: NM38) 25 50-90% Ongoin g management SMOK004. The percentage of patients aged 15 or over who are recorded as current smokers who have a record of an offer of support and treatment within the preceding 24 months (based on NM40) 12 40-90% SMOK005. The percentage of patients with any or any combination of the following conditions: CHD, PAD, stroke or TIA, hypertension, diabetes, COPD, CKD, asthma, schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder or other psychoses who are recorded as current smokers who have a record of an o ffer of support and treatment within the preceding 12 months (NICE 2011 menu ID: NM39 ) 25 56-96% SMOK - rationale for inclusion of indicator set Smoking has been identified as one of the top five risk factors for premature death in England. In England , 10% of pregnant women were known to be smokers at the time of delivery .113 Smoking is linked to a wide range of disease and conditions including canc ers, respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, stomach and duodenal ulcers, erectile dysfunction and infertility, osteoporosis, cataracts, age related macular degeneration and periodontitis .114 Smoking during pregnan cy can cause serious pregnancy related health problems, these include: complications during labour and an increased risk of miscarriage, premature birth, still birth, low birth -weight and 113 NHS Digital. Statistics on Women's Smoking Status at Time of Delivery: Englan d Quarter 2, 2020 US DH and Human Services 2004 87 sudden unexpected death in infancy .115 Smoking during pregnancy also increases the risk of infant mortality by an estimated 40 per cent .116 The aim of this domain is to increase the proportion of successful smoking quit attempts by providing the best available support and treatment. There is go od evidence to suggest that offe ring support and treatment is sufficient to motivate some smokers to attempt to stop who would not have done so with brief advice to quit alone. 'An offer of support and treatment' means offering a referral or self -referral to a local NHS Stop Smoking Service adviser (who might be a member of the practice team) plus pharmacotherapy. Where such support is not acceptable to the patient, an alternative form of brief support, such as follow -up appointments with a GP or practice nurse trained in smoking cessation, may be offered. The NICE guidance on smoking interventions and services117 identifies the evidence - based interventions available for adults who smoke: behavioural support (individual and group) bupropion118 nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) - short and long acting varenicline119 very brief advice . For people who smoke and who are using, or are interested in using, a nicotine - containing e -cigarette on general sale to quit smoking, NICE recommend you explain that: although these products are not licensed medicines, they are regulated by the Tobacco and Related Products Regulations 2016 many people have found them helpful to quit smoking cigarettes people using e -cigarettes should stop smoking tobacco completely, because any smoking is harmful the evidence suggests that e -cigarettes are substantially less harmful to health than smoking but are not risk free the evid ence in this area is still developing, including evidence on the long - term health impact. Due to the potential for ex -smokers to resume smoking within three years of cessation, it is good clinical practice to ask patients with a history of smoking their current smoking status and offer treatment and advice where n ecessary. It is also good practice to ask and record the smoking status of newly registered patients and to offer support and treatment where necessary. 115 NICE PH26.

SMOK 002.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requireme nt criteria. Th e contractor should report smoking status using the following guidance: Smokers For patients who smoke, smoking status should be recorded in the preceding 12 months. Non-smokers It is recognised that life -long non -smokers are very unlikely to start smoking and repeatedly asking smoking status can be unnecessary. Smoking status for this group of patients should be recorded in the preceding 12 months for until the end of the financial year in which the patient reaches the age of 25. Once a patient is over the age of 25 years (e .g. in the financial year in which they reach the age of 26 or in any year following that financial year) to be classified as a non-smoker they should be recorded as: never smoked which is both after their 25th birthda y and after the earliest diagnosis date for the disease which led to the patient's inclusion on the SMOK002 register (e.g. one of the conditions listed on the SMOK002 register). Ex-smokers Ex-smokers can be recorded as such in the preceding 12 months for SMOK002. Practic es may choose to record ex -smoking status on an annual basis for three consecutive financial years and after that smoking status need only be recorded if there is a change. This is to recognise that once a patient has been an ex -smoker for more than three years they are unlikely to restart. For the purposes of QOF users of electronic cigarettes who have never smoked or given up smoking should be classified as non -smokers or ex -smokers respectively . 89 The disease register for the purpose of calculating APDF for SMOK002 and SMOK005 is defined as the sum of the number of patients on the disease registers for each of the conditions listed in the indicator wording. Patients with one or more co-morbidities , e.g. diabetes and CHD are only counted once. SMOK indicator 004 (based on NM40) The percentage of patients aged 15 or over who are recorded as current smokers who have a record of an offer of support and treatment within the preceding 24 months SMOK 004.1 Rationale See rationale above. SMOK 004.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria. There is no APDF calculation for SMOK004. SMOK indicator 005 (NICE 2011 menu ID: NM39) The percentage of patients with any or any combination of the following conditions: CHD , PAD, stroke or TIA, hypertension, diabetes, COPD, CKD, asthma, schizophrenia, dipolar affective disorder or other psychoses who are recorded as current smokers who have a record of an offer of support and treatment within the preceding 12 months SMOK 005 .1 Rationale See rationale above for guidance on 'support and treatment' and smoking cessation. This indicator relates to patients who are on the disease registers for CHD, PAD, stroke or TIA, hypertension, diabetes, COPD, CKD, asthma and mental health who are recorded as current smokers. SMOK 005.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria. The disease register for the purpose of calculating APDF for SMOK002 and SMOK005 is defined as the sum of the number of patients on the disease registers for each of the conditions listed in the indicator wording. Patients with one or more co-morbidities , e.g. diabetes and CHD are only counted once. 90 Vaccination and Immunisations (VI) Indicator Points Achievement thresholds Points at lower threshold VI001. The percentage of babies who reached 8 months old in the preceding 12 months, who have received at least 3 doses of a diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis containing vaccine before the age of 8 months (NICE 2020 menu ID: NM197 ) 18 90-95% 3 VI002. The percentage of children who reached 18 months old in the preceding 12 months, who have received at least 1 dose of MMR between the ages of 12 and 18 months (NICE 2020 menu ID: NM198 ) 18 90-95% 7 VI003. The percentage of children who reached 5 years old in the preceding 12 months, who have received a reinforcing dose of DTaP/IPV and at least 2 doses of MMR between the ages of 1 and 5 years (NICE 2020 menu ID: NM199) 18 87-95% 7 VI004. The percentage of patients who reached 80 years old in the preceding 12 months, who have received a shingles vaccine between the ages of 70 and 79 years (based on NM201 ) 10 50-60% - VI - rationale for inclusion of indicator set Vaccination current ly prevents 2 -3 million deaths worldwide every year .120 Recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) listed vaccine hesitancy as one of their top 10 biggest threats to global health. Health workers, especially those in communities, remain the most trusted advisors and influencers of vaccination decisions, and play a key role in providing patients with trusted, credible information on vaccines .121 VI indicator 001 (NICE 2020 menu ID: NM197) The percentage of babies who reached 8 months old in the preceding 12 months, who have received at least 3 doses of a dipht heria, tetanus and pertussis containing vaccine before the age of 8 months. 120 001.1 Rationale Diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (whooping cough) are acute infectious diseases that can have severe complications. The routine immunisation schedule states that the hexavalent (6 -in-1) vaccine is due at 8, 12 and 16 weeks old for immunisation to diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTaP) as well as poliomyelitis (IPV), haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) and hepatitis B (Public Health England 2020). The indicat or supports early vaccination according to the routine immunisation schedule. Measurement by 8 months old allows for vaccination deferral due to febrile illness but aims to achieve immunisation against the named acute infectious diseases as early as possib le. VI 001.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria. The only personalised care adjustment applicable is where the intervention described in the indicator is contraindicated for the patient. NM indicator 002 (NICE 2020 m enu ID: NM198 ) The percentage of children who reached 18 months old in the preceding 12 months, who have received at least 1 dose of MMR between the ages of 12 and 18 months. VI 002.1 Rationale MMR is the combined vaccine that protects against measles, mumps and rubella. These are highly infectious conditions that can have serious complications such as meningitis and encephalitis. The first MMR vaccine (MMR1) is due as part of the routine vaccination schedule for England within a month of the ch ild's first birthday (Public Health England 2020). The indicator supports early vaccination with the first dose of the MMR vaccine according to the routin e immunisation schedule. Measurement by 18 months old allows for vaccination deferral due to febrile illness but aims to achieve vaccination as early as possible. VI 002.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria. The only personalised care adjustment applicable is where the intervention described in the indicator is contraindicated for the patient. VI indicator 003 (NICE 2020 menu ID: NM199) The percentage of children who reached 5 years old in the preceding 12 months, who have received a reinforcing dose of DTaP/IPV and at least 2 doses of MMR between the ages of 1 and 5 years. 92 VI 003.1 Rationale The indicator supports immunisation according to the routine immunisation schedule. Measurement by 5 years old aims to achiev e full immunisation against these infectious diseases before children start school. VI 003.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria. The only personalised care adjustment applicable is where the intervention described in the indicator is contraindicated for the patient. VI indicator 004 (based on NM201) The percentage of patients who reached 80 years old in the preceding 12 months, who have received a shingles vaccine between the ages of 70 and 79 years. VI 004.1 Rationale Shingles is caused by the reactivation of a latent varicella zoster virus infection. Incidence and severity of disease are associated with increasing age. The routine immunisation schedule states that the shingles vaccine is due at 70 years old ( Public Health England 2020). Patients remain eligible for the vaccination until their 80 th birthday. The indicator supports vaccination against shingles for patients aged 70 years old and over. The effectiveness of the shingles vaccine decreases with increasing age so earlier vaccination is encouraged to ensure optimal protecti on against shingles. VI 400.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria. Patients should have received a complete course to be included in the numerator for this indicator. Practices may use a personalised care adjustment if the vaccine is contraindicated or if the patient has declined vaccination. 93 Public health domain Cervical screening (CS) Indicator Points Achievement thresholds CS005. The proportion of women eligible for screening aged 25 -49 years at end of period reported whose notes record that an adequate cervical screening test has been performed in the previous 3 years and 6 months (NICE 2017 menu ID: NM154 ) 7 45-80% CS006. The proportion of women eligible for screening and aged 50 -64 years at end of period reported whose notes record that an adequate cervical screening test has been performed in the previous 5 years and 6 months (NICE 2017 menu ID: NM155 ) 4 45-80% CS indicator 005 (NICE 2017 menu ID: NM154) The proportion of women eligible for screening aged 25 -49 years at end of period reported whose notes record that an adequate cervical screening test has been performed in the previous 3 years and 6 months CS indicator 00 6 (NICE 2017 menu ID: NM155) The proportion of women eligible for screen ing and aged 50 -64 years at end of period reported whose notes record that an adequate cervical screening test has been performed in the previous 5 year s and 6 months CS005.1 and 006.1 Rationale These indicators are designed to encourage and incentivise contractors to offer age appropriate cervical screening in line with the recommendations of the NHS Screening Programme and to continue to achieve high levels of uptake of this. Specific requireme nts apply to these indicators in relation to the Personalised Care Adjustment. These are detailed in Section 6. CS00 5.2 and CS006.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria. Commissioners may require that the contractor ca n provide a computer print -out showing the number of eligible women on the contractor list, the number with a personalised care adjustment and the number who have had a cervical screening test performed at the appropriate time interval. Women need to be se nt a minimum of three invitations before the personalised care adjustment of not responding to invitations for care can be applied as described in Section 6 of this guidance. Since 2019, there is a discrete SNOMED code to record that women have not respond ed to three invitations for cervical screening. 94 Section 5: Quality Improvement domain Early cancer diagnosis Indicator Points Achievement thresholds QIECD005 . The contractor can demonstrate continuous quality improvement activity focused on early cancer diagnosis as specified in the QOF guidance 27 NA QIECD006 . The contractor has participated in network activity to regularly share and discuss learning from quality improvement activity focused on early cancer diagnosis as specified in the QOF guidance. This would usually include participating in a minimum of two peer review meetings 10 NA Care of people with learning disabilities Indicator Points Achievement thresholds QILD007. The contractor can demonstrate continuous quality improvement activity focused on care of patients with a learning disability as specified in the QOF guidance 27 NA QILD008. The contractor has participated in network activity to regularly share and discuss learning from quality improvement activity focused on the care of patients with a learning disability as specified in the QOF guidance. This would usually include participating in a minimum of two network peer review meetings 10 NA Rationale for inclusion of a QI domain The aim of this d omain is to provide support for contractors and their staff to recognise areas of care which require improvement, and take steps to address this through the development and implementation of a quality improvement plan and sharing of learning across their n etwork. Being skilled in quality improvement has been recognised as a key role for healthcare professionals in the Shared View of Quality .122 NHS England and GPC England have worked with th e Royal College of General Practitioners, NICE and the Health Found ation to develop the topic specific guidance included here. This guidance sets specific objectives for each topic which contractors are expected to work towards and provides advice on poten tial quality improvement actions. Within the parameters set out in this guidance, contractors are encouraged to understand where they have the potential to make quality improvements and then to design and implement bespoke quality improvement plans, includ ing improvement 122 https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp -content/uploads/2016/12/nqb -shared -commitment -frmwrk.pdf 95 targets to address these. There are no deadlines given for the completion of the diagnostic activities, the subsequent plan or the network meetings. However, contractors are advised that they are expected to be working on these improvement activities throughout the QOF year. The two topic areas for 2021/22 are early diagnosis of cancer and supporting people with learning disabilities . For 2021/22 these modules will be repeated in their original format, with some slight modifications to account for the impact of the pandemic on care. Following 2021/22, t he QI topics will change on an annual basis. Through practice engagement with these and future modules we expect to see measurable improvement in the quality of care and patient experience at a national level against the areas of focus described in the ind ividual modules. The focus of the indicators and associated points is on contractor engagement and participation in the quality improvement activity both in the practice and through sharing of learning across their network. This is to recognise that not a ll quality improvement activity will be successful in terms of its immediate impact on patient care. If a contractor does not achieve the targets which they have set themselves this would not in itself be a reason to withhold QOF points and associated paym ents, unless they have also failed to participate in the activities described in the guidance. All the supporting information and resources referred to in this guidance will be made available on NHS England's website by end of March 2021 . Further informati on as to how to undertake quality improvement activities is available from a number of sources including: NHS England Sustainable Improvement Team (https://www.england.nhs.uk/sustainableimp rovement/ ) - this is a national resource to support quality improvement activity in primary care and includes training, practical advice and support from quality improvement specialists.

The contractor can demonstrate continuous quality improvement activity focused on early cancer diagnosis as specified in the QOF guidance 27 NA QIECD006 . The contractor has participated in network activity to regularly share and discuss learning from quality improvement activity focused on early cancer diagnosis as specified in the QOF guidance. This would usually include participating in a minimum of two peer review meetings 10 NA Rationale Cancer has a huge impact both in numbers of people affected and on the individual and those close to them. More than 300,000 people received a first treatment for cancer in the UK in 2018 ( NHS England 2019 ). Although cancer outcomes have improved significantly with 10,000 more patients surviving for at least 12 months after diagnosis than compared with five years earlier ( NHS England 2019 ), international studies have demonstrated that the UK can make further improvements. The NHS Long Term Plan sets out an ambition that by 2028 the proportion of cancers diagnosed at stages 1 and 2 will rise from around half now to three -quarters of cancer patients. NHS England estimate s that achieving this will mean that, from 2028, 55,000 more people each year will survive their cancer for at least five years after diagnosis. For most cancers survival is much greater at bot h one and five years if detected at stage one - highlighting the need for early diagnosis ( Hawkes 2019 ). Other benefits from early diagnosis include relief of symptoms ( NICE 2017 ). In 2020/21 the coronavirus pandemic presented major challenges for all healthcare systems. One of the most significant impacts was a sharp reduction in the number of people co ming forward to general practice and being referred urgently with suspected cancer and referred from cancer screening programmes. Thanks to the efforts of NHS staff and their partners, the number of people receiving first or subsequent treatment was mainta ined at % of that in the same period in 2019 (March to December 2020). Although urgent cancer referrals recovered in late 2020, it will be important to avoid a repeat of the steep fall in referrals we saw in April 2020. It is important therefore for practitioners to retain a high index of suspicion, to continue to refer patients in line with NG12 and to safety net patients with suspected cancer. Practices should maintain an awareness of referral and testing pathways, 97 including the impact of any pathway changes implemented as part of the pandemic response. Furthermore, referral numbers have been slower to recover on some pathways than others - in particular on the lung and urology pathways - and the overall volume of peop le receiving first treatment for cancer in -year was down compared to the previous year. In light of this, it will be especially important for general practice to be vigilant in identifying potential cancer cases in 2021/22 so that as many of those people a s possible who have not yet come forward can be picked up and referred at the earliest possible stage. General practice plays a crucial role in the timely diagnosis of cancer, with almost 68% of people with cancer first reporting their symptoms at their GP surgery ( Swann et al 2018 ). In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic it is important that practices continue to lead efforts to grow public confidence in the safety and availability of general practice se rvices , including the availability of face -to-face consultations where required. Use of the NICE guideline on suspected cancer ( NG12 ) may increase appropriate referrals for suspected cancer and reduce t he number of presentations before referral ( NICE 2018 ). In addition, whilst other providers deliver screening services for bowel an d breast cancer, actions taken in general practice can increase uptake of national cancer screening programmes ( Hewitson et al 2011 ). Cancer screening programmes have been shown to impro ve patient outcomes: Regular bowel cancer screening has been shown to reduce the risk of dying from bowel cancer by over 16% ( UK NSC 2018 ). Deaths from cervical cancer have decr eased by around 60% since the introduction of the national cervical screening programme ( UK NSC 2015 ). Evidence suggests a 20% reduction in deaths from breast cancer in women invited for bre ast screening ( UK NSC 2013 ). The NHS Long Term Plan sets out an ambition that by 2028 t he proportion of cancers diagnose d at stages 1 and 2 will rise from around half now to three -quarters of cancer patients. NHS England estimate that a chieving this will mean that, from 2028, 55,000 more people each year will survive their cancer for at least five years after diagnosis. Overview of the QI module The overarching objective of these QI indicators is to contribute to improvements in relatio n to the following aspects of care: 1) Participation in national breast, cervical and bowel cancer detection and prevention screening programmes among a practice's registered population. 2) Referral practices for patients suspected of having cancer; including u se of guidelines, professional development, safety netting of those referred on suspected cancer pathways and shortening of diagnostic intervals. 98 Practices will need to undertake the following steps: The following section includes further detail on the t ypes of things practices could do to deliver this module. These are suggestions and recommendations only and the decision about what to include in the QI plan and which QI methodologies to use should be made by practices and shared with their peers through the network meetings. Practices are expected to undertake quality improvement activity in both screening and early diagnosis. This quality improvement activity will support existing efforts of local public health commissioning teams and Cancer Alliances and will contribute to the success of STP and NHS Long Term Plan commitments. Step 1Evaluate the current uptake of screening programmes in their population andassess how well the practice currently diagnoses cases of cancer at the earliest possible stage Evaluate the current referral practices for patients suspected of having cancer, including assessments made through remote consultations; including use of guidelines, safety netting and shortening time to diagnosis. Step 2Create an improvement plan Step 3Implement the improvement plan Step 4Participate in a minimum of 2 local GP Primary Care Network peer review meetings Step 5Complete the QI monitoring template 99 Detailed contractor guidance 1. Identifying areas for improvement All practices should start with an assessment of the current quality of care they provide. This should include: 1. An assessment of practice screening programme uptake rates compared to local or national baselines. PHE fi ngertips has an easy to use tool to compare cancer indicators by practice to quickly identify areas for more in -depth audits. Practices should consider how they can include a focus on inequalities in screening in their assessment, particularly for those at risk and with low uptake. 2. An assessment of current referral practice through: i. Participation in the National Cancer Diagnosis Audit or other retrospective audit of recent cancer diagnose s. Data could be collected, e.g. on the route to diagnosis; referral pathways used; use of virtual vs face -to-face appointments ; time from first presentation of symptoms/signs in primary care to referral and investigations . Practices can use their existing 2019/20 NCDA audit report . Practices may want to focus in more depth on cancers such as lung where there is often more unmet need and where, as a result of the pandemic, there has been a significant drop in the number of urgent cancer referrals and subseque nt number of first treatments. All tumour types have seen a drop in the number of first treatments ; however , those where there has been the most significant decrease include the other most common cancers - breast, colorectal and prostate - as well as skin, bladder, head and neck, kidney and uterine. Practices may find the Quality Improvement Toolkit for Early Diagnosis of Cancer helpful in identifying ways to use their audit findings to inform their quality improvement activity. https://www.rcgp.org.uk/cancer ii. From the patients identified in the audit, practices may find it helpful to undertake a more in -depth learning / significant event analysis around a patient where the referral or diagnosis process could hav e been better as a way to further identify areas for quality improvement. The RCGP and Macmillan have a helpful toolkit for this type of analysis www.rcgp.org.uk/seatoolkit Practices could also, or alterna tively, audit and review the current system in place for safety netting around suspected cancer diagnoses as their early diagnosis activity. Practices who do not have a demonstrably robust practice -wide system for safety netting suspected cancer patients s hould consider implementing one as part of their quality improvement activities. Macmillan's safety netting and coding module could support this activity and the Macmillan Quality Improvement Toolkit can also provide some structure to improve this area (Module 2, question 8). It is anticipated that practice QI activity will dovetail with both local priorities and wider cancer activities. The work is intended to align with existing efforts of local public health commissioning teams and cancer alliances. GP network peer group meetings will provide a forum to establish and agree on allied priorities. 100 Practices are encouraged to seek the views of patients and carers where this will help with quality improvement activity. This could be done through engagement with a patient participa tion group and/ or a survey of patients. Practices may also find it useful to undertake a reflective group meeting and complete a 'SWOT' (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) analysis. Guidance as to how to do this can be found in the RCGP gu ide How to get started in QI. 2. Creating an improvement plan Following the diagnostic phase above, practices should focus their QI activities on outcomes such as: 1. An increase in the follow -up and informed consent/refusal of screening for cervical, breast or bowel cancer. 2. A reduction in inequitable uptake of screening in population groups identified by the practice. 3. An increase in the proportion of cases w here cancer diagnoses are reviewed and learnt from. 4. A decrease in the time from presentation to referral. 5. An increase in the proportion of suspected cancer referrals where a demonstrably robust practice -wide system for safety -netting is used. These outco mes will be used at a national level to assess the impact of the module and practices should consider how they measure improvement when choosing aims for their projects. The above have been designed as process -based measures as the time lag for national sc reening and diagnosis outcome data is too long to assess in a year of improvement. Practices may wish to use both data collected during the National Cancer Diagnosis Audit and the ensuing bespoke improvement report provided (by the NCDA) as aids to identif y change ideas. Macmillan's Quality Improvement Toolkit for Cancer Care in Primary Care also includes searches that have been integrated into the three main GP IT systems (EMIS Web, TPP SystmOne, INPS Vision) within England to support the identification of areas for quality improvement around screening and early diagnosis. Once practices have identified their area/s for improvement they should be clear about: The aims of the project - what will be achieved and by when. These aims should be SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time -bound). The measures - what data will be collected to know if the aims have been met. Measurements to assess the effectiveness of changes made should be straightforward for teams to collect regularly. Practice project measures could be stratified into: o Process, e.g. proportion of patients screened for x cancer o Outcomes, e.g. level of confidence of a team member to opportunistically raise screening at reception (then book a smear appointment) 101 o Balancing, e.g. the average waiting time for a routine appointment (at the expense of extra smear clinics) The changes - what different ways of doing things will be tested. Practices should choose their own quality improvement activities and set their own targets for improvem ent based on their baseline audit or search results. These should be challenging but realistic and recognise that it may be easier to make larger improvements when starting from a modest baseline. These should be validated by network peers as part of the i nitial network review meeting. Multiple small tests of change are recommended. Practices should aim to find a way to ensure improvement is continuous and that quality improvement around early cancer diagnosis becomes routine. See Box 1 for examples of SMAR T aims. Box 1. Examples of SMART aims Area for improvement 1: Baseline analysis identifies x% of people eligible for screening for y cancer have not responded to invites. SMART aim: The practice aims to contact z% of non -responders over the next 6 months providing additional information to support informed decision making about screening. Area for improvement 2: Baseline analysis identifies only x% of eligible patients with a learning disability have responded to their screening invite. SMART aim: The practice aims to contact y% of non -responders with a learning disability over 6 months and provide appropriate support to make informed decisions or best interest decisions as appropriate . Area for improvement 3: Baseline analysis identifies only x% of new cancer diagnosis cases are reviewed and learnt from. SMART aim: The practice aims to increase the % of new cancer diagnosis cases which are reviewed and learnt fr om, by y% to z%, over 6 months. Area for improvement 4 : Baseline analysis identifies an average of x days from initial presentation to date of referral. SMART aim: The practice aims to decrease the time from initial presentation to referral to under y da ys over the next 6 months. (This may not be an ideal choice for smaller practices or where high -quality audit data is not available) Area for improvement 5: Baseline analysis identifies the proportion of suspected cancer referrals with systematic safety netting to check they are seen in secondary care as x%. SMART aim: The practice aims to increase the proportion of referrals with systematic safety netting to y% over the next 6 months. 102 iii. Implementing the plan Practices should implement the improvement plan they have developed to support the objectives they have identified. It is recommended that these plans and associated improvement activities should involve the whole practice team and practices are encouraged to engage with colleagues outside the practice where practical, for example public health and the screening service if addressing screening, or secondary care or other local practices when addressing ea rly diagnosis in order to share learning. Where possible, patients should be involved in quality improvement activity, at the most basic level this would involve discussion of planned activity with the practice's patient participation group but could inv olve surveys and or focus groups where this would be practical and relevant for the planned activity. Example case studies can be downloaded from https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp - content/uploads/2020/02/20 -21-qof-qi-cases -studies.pdf iv. Network peer review meetings A key objective of the network peer review meetings is to enable shared learning across the network. The first meeting should aim to validate and agree meaningful QI activity plans and to share baseline information. The second should focus on shared learni ng from the quality improvement process and change activities undertaken. It is also intended to provide a forum for practices to identify wider system issues impacting on care quality which may require a collective response. Whilst these meetings would u sually be face to face, networks are able to explore other mechanisms to facilitate real time peer learning and sharing including virtual meetings. Practices can choose the most appropriate members of the team to attend. The peer review group will usually be the Primary Care Network of which the practice is a member. Suggested discussion points for these meetings are made in Box 2. The network clinical director or their nominated deputy or a clinical lead should facilitate these meetings and maintain a reco rd of attendance. It is for the network to determine the timing of these meetings, but it is recommended that the first meeting takes place early in the QI activity at the stage of deciding on what quality improvement activities to undertake and the second towards the end to share outcomes and learning from these activities. Contractors should participate in a minimum of two network peer review discussions unless there are exceptional and unforeseen circumstances which impact on a contractor's ability to pa rticipate, more meetings maybe beneficial to the process. 103 Box 2. Suggested peer review meeting discussion points The first peer review meeting should take place early in the QI activity and focus on: Sharing the outputs of the audit and search baseline work to understand the issues for each practice, compare screening rates and share significant event analyses. Accounting fo r outlier practices, QI focus should ideally be on worst uptake of screening programmes at network/ 'local' level. Validation of practice improvement plans and targets. Alignment with the wider cancer activities and local priorities Discussion points coul d include: What relevant evidence -based guidance / quality standards can the group use? What data has each practice used to inform its review of current performance? How timely and robust is this data? Has the right focus been chosen by each practice based on their current performance? Has each practice set a clear aim with a challenging bu t realistic local target, and agreed an appropriate measurement to monitor impact? What ideas for changes is each practice planning to try in an improvement cycle? How are practices ensuring that the whole practice team (including other clinical colleagu es and patients and carers) are engaged in the proposed QI activity? The awareness and adoption of referral support technology to reduce variability, e.g. 'C the signs'123 The second peer review meeting should take place towards the end of the QI activity and focus on: Celebrating success and sharing of key changes made in practice. Encouraging a compassionate, no -blame and active learning culture. How these changes have been embed ded and will be sustained. Discussion points could include: What results have each practice seen in their QI activity testing? What changes have been adopted in each practice? How will these changes be sustained in the future? What new skills have staff developed and how can they be used next? What further QI activity in cancer screening and early diagnosis is planned in each practice? What further actions may need to take place (e.g. at network or CCG level) to support the changes in practices? Not all changes are improvements, what has been tried and failed/ had unintended consequences? v. Reporting and verification The contractor will need to complete the QI monitoring template in relation to this module and self -declare that they have completed t he activity described in their QI plan. The contractor will also self -declare that they have attended a minimum of two 123 https://cthesigns.co.uk/ 104 peer review meetings (either in person , when appropriate , or virtually) as described above, unless there are exceptional and unforeseen c ircumstances which impact on a contractor's ability to participate. In these circumstances' contractors are expected to make efforts to ensure alternative participation in peer review. Verification - Commissioners may require contractors to provide a copy of the QI monitoring template as written evidence that the quality improvement activity has been undertaken. Commissioners may require the network clinical lead to provide written evidence of attendance at the peer review meetings. If a contractor has bee n unable to attend a meeting due to exceptional circumstances, then they will need to demonstrate other active engagement in network peer learning and review. Alternative audits can be found in Appendix of the document https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp -content/uploads/2020/02/20 -21-qof-qi-cancer.pdf Care of people with l earning disabilities Indicator Points Achievement thresholds QILD007. The contractor can demonstrate continuous quality improvement activity focused on care of patients with a learning disability as specified in the QOF guidance 27 NA QILD008. The contractor has participated in network activity to regularly share and discuss learning from quality improvement activity focused on the care of patients with a learning disability as specified in the QOF guidance. This would usually include participating in a minimum of two network peer review meetings 10 NA Rationale A learning disability is a significantly reduced ability to understand complex information or learn new skills; a reduced ability to cope independently; and a condition which started before adulthood with a lasting effect ( Valuing People, 2001 ). People with a learning disability experience significant health inequality: The gap between the age at dea th for people with a learning disabilities (age 4 years) and the general population (all ages) is 23 years for males and 27 years for females ( LeDeR, 2018 ); the median age at death for someone with profound LD is 40 years. The commonest recorded causes of death in order are pneumonia, aspiration pneumonia, sepsis, dementia, CVD, epilepsy. A confidential inquiry concluded that 42% of deaths for people with a learning disability are premature. The most common reasons are delays or problems with diagnosis or treatment, and problems with identifying needs and providing appropriate care in response to changing needs. 105 People with Learning Disabilities are significantly more likely to have co -morbidities. Since 2015, Public Health England and NHS Digital have examined GP records to monitor the prevalence of co -morbidities for half the population of England. The co - morbidities occurring more frequently in the learning disability population than the general population are obesity, asthma, constipation, dysp hagia, GORD, epilepsy, dementia and mental health problems. Currently only about 25% of the estimated 1.1 million people in England with a learning disability are recorded on the current Learning Disability QOF register (Learning Disabilities Observatory, 2016 ). Improving the accuracy of the QOF register will help ensure people with a learning disabilit y are offered annual health checks. The annual health check is an evidence -based tool recommend by NICE ( QS101 , QS187 ). Health checks can identify undetected health conditions early, ensure the appropriateness of ongoing treatments and establish trust and support continuity of care. The RCGP provides support that practices can use. Health check action - planning provides the opportunity to positively promote health by encouraging cancer screening uptake , immunisations and healthy lifestyle. People with a learning disability are more likely to be obese, less likely to take up all national cancer screening offers and only 44.7% received a flu vaccination in 2018. General practice has a ke y role in optimisi ng prescribing to reduce harm (NICE NG5, QS120 ). For people with a learning disability, this includes reviewing the over - prescribing of psychotropic medication in the absence of a mental health diagnosis (STOMP initiative PHE, 2015 ) . General practice can play a vital role in improving holistic person -centred care for people with a learning disability to enable them to live their ambition of fulfilled lives in the community. Providing holistic care can improve outcomes and ensure people live safely by raising awareness of the risk of abuse of vulnerable individuals. By treating people and their families with this dignity general practice will gain the respect of people with a learning d isability. Overview of the QI module The overarching aim of this QI module is to improve care for people of all ages with a learning disability (with or without autism), including: 1) Improve the accuracy of the GP register by increasing the identification and coding of people of all ages with a learning disability including those with a dual diagnosis of learning disability and autism so that those on the register can be proactively invited for health checks, vaccinations e tc. Practices should ensure inclusion of any under -represented groups such as children and young people and people from BAME backgrounds. 2) Increased uptake of annual health checks in people aged 14 and over, acting as an iterative process of personalised care planning to manage co - morbidities, reduce unnecessary hospitalisations, promote health positively and reduce premature mortality. The health check should always produce a personalised action plan to facilitate this. A health action plan should be agreed with the patient and carer during the health check, and should be 106 individually developed and based on an individual's physical and mental health and well -being. The health action plan should take account of any condition management issues identifie d as part of the annual health check. The health action plan should include any additional population -based screening, health improvement and health promotion considerations as required. 3) Optimisation of medications in line with the STOMP initiative (stopp ing over prescribing of medication for people with learning disability) with a focus on identifying those on antipsychotic medication to review the clinical appropriateness (in partnership with local MDT including psychiatry and social care) and to monitor side effects such as metabolic effects. 4) Recording of the need for, and type of, reasonable adjustments required and evidence that these are being implemented in practice as set out in the Equality Act and record preferred means of communication as required by the Accessible Information Standard. 5) Implementing the learning from the 2019/20 LeDeR report124 to improve care for patients. This could include reviewing the co -ordination of care for people with a learning disability and reviewing processes on recognising acute deterioration in the health and mental wellbeing of a person with learning disabilities. Th e LeDeR report recommends a renewed focus on the safety of people with learning disabilities and epilepsy. 6) Consideration of the use of wider community support through engagement with local community learning disability services and network social prescrib ers, in collaboration with people with a learning disability and their families and carers . 124 https://www.hqip.org.uk/wp -content/uploads/2020/07/LeDeR_2019_annual_report_FINAL.pdf 107 Practices will need to undertake the following steps: The following section includes further detail on the types of things practices could do to deliver this module. These are suggestions only and the decision about what to include in the QI plan and which QI methodologies to use should be made by practices a nd shared with their peers through the network meetings. Detailed contractor guidance 1. Identifying areas for improvement All practices should start with an assessment of the current quality of care they provide to patients of all ages on the Learning Disa bility QOF register. This should include: 1. Improving the accuracy and increase prevalence of the Learning Disability QOF register by running searches of the NHS England provided codes to case -find people on the practice list who 'may' have a learning disab ility, using the inclusion tool125 provided to determine whether the individual would benef it from being on the register and then adding the code 'on learning disability register' for those for whom this is appropriate. (Those currently on the practice list but not on the QOF register who 'will' have a learning disability will be automatically c ase-found and placed on the register from 1/1/202 the current quality of the care of their Learning Disabled patients and identify areas for improvement -this would include a baseline assessment of current care quality. Step 2Create an improvement plan Step 3Implement the plan Step 4Participate in a minimum of 2 local GP Primary Care Network peer review meetings Step 5Complete the QI monitoring template 108 2. Completing a whole practice training needs analysis in learning disability awareness, awareness of the requirements of the Equality Act and awareness of implementation of the Mental Capacity Act. 3. Reflecting on the practice's overall approach to how it cares for people with learning disability including looking at practice data on the rate of annual health check completion, use of an approved health check electronic template, health promotion activi ty including, cancer screening and vaccination rates, long term condition management and healthy living indicators (e.g. obesity, smoking, drugs, alcohol, sexual health). 4. Evaluating by practice self -assessment, how reasonable adjustments are identified, h ighlighted and implemented including the accessible information standard. For practices already completing high quality annual health checks , on track to achieving the national 75% uptake target, with application of well -received and 'consistent for the individual' reasonable adjustments, where quality of care provided by the health check is already monitored, then extended evaluation could include: Evaluation of the acute care of people with a learning disability by reviewing acute h ospital admissions, repeat admissions, preventable admissions, failure to attend hospital appointments and investigations and by detailed mortality review if a death of a Learning Disabled person has occurred in the practice. Audit of adults on the QOF le arning disability register but not on the QOF MH register who are currently prescribed an antidepressant, an antipsychotic or a benzodiazepine and those adults on the Learning Disability QOF register without a diagnosis of epilepsy who are currently taking an antidepressant. Audit of the numbers of adult patients on the Learning Disability QOF register who have a Summary Care Record with Additional Information. Audit of the numbers of patients on the Learning Disability QOF register who have a NHS Digita l 'reasonable adjustment' flag (if available in the practice area) or alternative flag on their record. Practices may also find it useful to undertake a reflective group meeting and/ or complete a SWOT analysis (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, thre ats) of the practice's approach to identifying, managing the care of and supporting people with learning disabilities. Guidance on basic QI concepts and tools can be found in the NHS England An Introduction to Quality Improvement in General Practice and the RCGP QI Ready tool . NHS England and the RCGP have also produced free support resources, in par ticular, the comprehensive Health Checks for People with Learning Disability Toolkit .126 Practices may want to involve the local community learning di sability services, where this is possible, to provide additional support and advice on identifying areas for improvement including case -finding, and to access local training opportunities. Local 126 https://www.rcgp.org.uk/clinical -and-research/resources/toolkits/health -check -toolkit.aspx 109 multi -disciplinary learning disability services can also supp ort the provision of additional community -based support and personal health budgets. 2. Creating improvement plan Following the diagnostic phase above, practices should focus their QI activities on the following outcomes: 1. Increase the number of people on the Learning Disability QOF register in order to enable these people to be proactively called for health checks an d flu immunisations and have their needs for reasonable adjustments recorded and flagged. 2. Increase the uptake of high quality annual health checks, including health check action plans, to 75% of all those on the QOF Learning Disability Register aged 14 and over to enable excellent planned care to be provided to improve health outcomes. 3. Increase the numbers of people of all ages on the Learning Disability QOF register who have received an annual flu immunisation - the rationale being that respiratory infec tion is the commonest cause of death in people with a learning disability. 4. Improve the provision and understanding of Reasonable Adjustments by the practice including recording these using the Reasonable Adjustment Flag (if available in the practice area) , using the Summary Care Record with Additional Information, ensuring adjustments needed are included in all communications from the practice and adhering to the Accessible Information Standard. The outcomes listed will be used at a national level to as sess the impact of the module and practices should consider how they measure improvement when choosing aims for their projects. In parallel with this, the quality of the annual health check, robustness of care planning and impact on health care such as imp rovements in long term condition management and reduction of unnecessary hospital admission would be addressed. Quality improvement activity should focus on measurable impact. Once practices have identified their area/s for improvement they should be clear about: The aims of the project - what will be achieved and by when. These aims should be SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time -bound). The measures - what data will be collected to know if the aims have been met. Measurements t o assess the effectiveness of changes made should be straightforward for teams to collect regularly. o Process, e.g. numbers of people with a learning disability invited for health check / offered flu vaccination / with documented communication preference. o Outcomes, e.g. proportion of people with a learning disability having personalised health action plan in place / receiving flu vacc / showing improved management of a long -term condition , e.g. improved HbA1c or 110 BP reading / taking up appropriate cancer scr eening / supported to stop smoking / reduce excessive alcohol intake) o Balancing, e.g. checking the proportion of people with severe mental illness having a physical health check does not reduce (due to focus on learning disability) The changes - what diffe rent ways of doing things will be tested. Practices should choose their own quality improvement activities and set their own targets for improvement based on their baseline audit or search results. These should be challenging but realistic and recognise th at it may be easier to make larger improvements when starting from a modest baseline. These should be validated by network peers as part of the initial network review meeting. Multiple small tests of change are recommended. Practices should aim to find a way to ensure improvement is continuous and that quality improvement becomes routine. See Box 3 for examples of SMART aims. Practices should consider which QI tools and techniques are most suitable to support their improvement project. Examples include: Case finding exercise: a series of coding searches to find and re -code any missing cases (see resources section). Process mapping and reviewing how health check recalls and reminders are carried out and how the process is made as streamlined as possible (e.g. with blood tests carried out in time for results to be available to reduce unnecessary extra visits, methods of invitation of the individual to the appointment by their preferred method to reduce the rate of failure to attend, guidance to paid carers about importance of the check). Structured review with a focus group including patients, family members and their carers using a fram ework such as TEACH (time, environment, attitude, communication, and help) to map how the practice identifies, records and implements reasonable adjustments. Creating run charts to document the monthly measurement of achievement of aims such as numbers of completed health checks, medications reviews done, flu vaccinations completed, reasonable adjustment flags added, Summary Care Record with Additional Infor mation added or screening invitations taken up. 111 Box 3. Examples of SMART aims practices could consider: Area for improvement 1: The practice learning disability register has not been checked for accuracy for many years. The practice follows the new guidance from NHS England on searches for codes showing patients on the list who 'may' have a learning disability. SMART aim: To revie w the records and/or make contact with all identified individuals to determine whether they would benefit from being placed on the register. This will be done for x% of the list of those who 'may' have a learning disability each quarter with incremental pr ogress through the year to y% by the end of 12 months. Area for improvement 2 : The practice last year completed annual health checks on x% of people on its QOF learning disability register aged 14 and over. SMART aim: To increase progressively the propor tion of people on its QOF learning disability register aged 14 and over having a completed annual health check to (the national DES target of) 75% within y months. Area for improvement 3 : The practice had no system for identifying and recording reasonable adjustments needed for people with learning disability. SMART aim: To introduce a system that leads to x% of all patients with learning disability having an agreed digital flag (NHS Digital Reasonable Adjustment Flag or local alternative) within 12 month s. Area for improvement 4: The practice had not recorded the preferred means of communication for invitation for the Health Check in the majority of patients and failed to invite for the health check by the preferred means. SMART aim: To ensure that in i ncremental steps during the year x% of those aged 14 and over have preferred means of communication recorded in their notes and that this method is used to invite that x% to their health check in the coming year. Area for improvement 5: The practice ident ified that 45% of people on the learning disability QOF register had a recorded flu vaccination last year. SMART aim: To increase the proportion of people on the learning disability QOF register receiving the flu vaccine - or declining through a valid, do cumented, informed consent process to x% within 12 months. Area for improvement 6: The practice found that 30% of female patients in the appropriate age group and on the learning disability register had attended for cervical cancer screening within recom mended timescales. A staff survey identified the lack of confidence of practice nurses in assessing capacity and gaining consent and discussing sensitive sexual behaviour with women with a learning disability including the risk of sexual abuse. SMART aim: All clinical staff offering cervical screening to undergo training in learning disability awareness, Mental Capacity Act and Adult Safeguarding in order 112 to support women with a learning disability to engage with cervical screening and sexual health promot ion with all staff reporting increased confidence in this area within 6 months. SMART aim: The practice will increase the proportion of women attending for cervical screening (or declining through a valid, documented informed consent process) to X% in the second 6 months of the year. Area for improvement 7 : A patient registered with the practice and on the learning disability register died during the last 12 months. No documented review or significant / learning event analysis was held after the death. SMART aim: Every death of a person on the LD register is considered as a significant event with a documented reflective analysis of what lessons the practice could learn including identification of good practice and ar eas for improvement. 3. Implementing the plan Practices should implement the improvement plan they have developed to support the objectives they have identified. It is recommended that these plans and associated improvement activities should involve the whole practice team and practices are encouraged to engage with colleagues outside the practice, where practicable, for example local community learning disability services, social prescribers, network pharmacist, patient support groups, family carer groups and specialist third sector organisations. Where possible, patients and their family members and carers should be involved in quality improvement activity around the health inequalities experienced by and the impact of the person's learning disability on their life. Local learning disability services may be able to assist using support of experts by experience, local advocacy services, and local learning disability carer groups. Example case studies can be downloaded from https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp - content/uploads/2020/02/20 -21-qof-qi-cases -studies.pdf 4. GP Network peer review meetings A key objective of the network peer review meetings is to enable shared learning across the network. The aim of this is to improve learning from quality improvement activities referencing the need to improve outcomes from learning from the LeDeR (Learning Disability Mortality Review) process. It is important to recognise the vulnerability of people with a learning disability and their ability to access healthcare, factors which impact on the greater health inequalities they face. It is intended to provide a forum for practices to identify wider system issues impacting on care quality which may require a collective response . Contractors should participate in a minimum of two network peer review discussions unless there are exceptional and unforeseen circumstances which impact on a contractor's ability to participate. Whilst these meetings would usually be face to face, networks are able to explore other mechanisms to facilitate real time peer learning and sharing including virtual meetings. 113 The pee r review group will usually be the Primary Care Network of which the practice is a member. Where the practice is not part of a network their peer review group should be agreed with the commissioner. Suggested discussion points for these meetings are made i n Box 4. The network clinical lead or their nominated deputy should facilitate these meetings and maintain a record of attendance. It is for the network to determine the timing of these meetings, but it is recommended that the first meeting takes place ea rly in the QI activity at the stage of deciding on what quality improvement activities to undertake and the second towards the end to share outcomes and learning from these activities. Box 4. Suggested peer review meeting discussion points The first peer review meeting should take place early in the QI activity and focus on: Sharing the outputs of baseline work to understand the issues for each practice concerning the quality of overall care provided to their Learning -Disabled patients Practices should be able to share data at the first peer review meeting. In order to monitor progress practices should share their previous year's health check uptake as a percentage of those aged 14 and over on the LD QOF register, their flu vaccination uptake as a percentage of all those of all ages on the LD QOF register and their LD prevalence data (numbers on register as a percentage of total practice population) Validation of practice improvement targets. Discussion points could include: What relevant evidenc e-based guidance / quality standards can the group use? What data has each practice used to inform its review of current performance? Has the right focus been chosen by each practice based on their current performance? Has each practice set a clear aim with a challenging but realistic local target, and agreed an appropriate measurement to monitor impact? What ideas for changes is each practice planning to try in an improvement cycle? How are practices ensuring that the whole practice team (including ot her clinical colleagues and patients and carers) are engaged in the proposed QI activity? The second peer review meeting should take place towards the end of the QI activity and focus on: Celebrating success and sharing of key changes made in practice. Encouraging a compassionate, no -blame and active learning culture. How these changes have been embedded and will be sustained. Discussion points could include: What results have each practice seen in their QI activity testing? What changes have been adopted in each practice? How will these changes be sustained in the future? What new skills have staff developed and how can they be used next? 114 What further QI activity is planned in each practice? What further actions may need to take place (e.g. at network or CCG level) to support the changes in practices? 5. Reporting and verification The contractor will need to complete the QI monitoring template in relation to this module and self -declare that they have completed the activity d escribed in their QI plan. The contractor will also self -declare that they have attended a minimum of two peer review meetings (either in person , where appropriate , or virtually) as described above, unless there are exceptional and unforeseen circumstances which impact on a contractor's ability to participate. In these circumstances' contractors are expected to make efforts to ensure alternative participation in peer review. Verification - Commissioners may require contractors to provide a copy of the QI monitoring template as written evidence that the quality improvement activity has been undertaken. Commissioners may require the network clinical lead to provide written evidence of attendance at the peer review meetings. If a contractor has been unable to attend a meeting due to exceptional circumstances, then they will need to demonstrate other active engagement in network peer learning and review.

This will allow practices to differentiate between the following reasons for adjusting care and removing a patient from the indicator denominator: unsuit ability for the patient, e.g. because of medicine intolerance or allergy, or contra -indicated polypharmacy; patient choice , following a shared -decision making conversation; the patient did not respond to offers of care - recording of this will change to capture actual invitations sent to patients; the specific service is not available (in relation to a limited number of indicators only); or newly diagnosed or newly registered patients, as per exis ting rules. As with exception reporting a pplying a PCA to the patient record will remove that patient from an indicator denominator if the QOF defined interven tion has not been delivered . It will not result in patients being removed from the disease register or other target population. This mechanism differs from 'exclusions' which refer to patients on a particular clinical register who are not included in an indicator denominator for defi nitional reasons. For example, an indicator (and therefore the denominator) may refer only to patients of a specific age group, patients with a specific status (e.g. those who smoke), or patients with a specific length of diagnosis, within the register for that clinical area. Principles When considering whether a PCA applies to an individual patient practices are reminded that: the duty of care remains for all patients, the decision to apply a personalised care adjustment should be based on clinical judgem ent, informed by patient preferences and underpinned by shared decision -making principles , with clear and auditable reasons coded or entered in free text on the patient record there should be no blanket personalised care adjustments : the relevant issues with each patient shou ld be considered by the clinician at each level of the clinical indicator set and this decision reviewed on a regular basis. In each case where a personalised care adjustment is applied then in addition to what needs to be re ported for payment purposes (in accordance with the Business Rules), the contractor should also ensure that the reason for the adjustment is fully recorded in a way that can facilitate both safe and effective patient care and audit of the patient record. For example, where a patient h as not tolerated medication, the nature of the contraindication should be recorded in the patient's record as well as a code to indicate intolerance. 116 Criteria for the personalised care adjustment Personalisation of care can oc cur for the following reasons which are listed in the order in which they will be extracted in the Business Rules : 1. The investigative service or secondary care service is unavailable (where relevant to the indicator) 2. Intervention described in the indicator is clinically unsuitable 3. The patient has chosen not to receive the intervention described in the indicator 4. The patient has not responded to invitations for the intervention described in the indicator (a minimum of two invitations for the interven tion in the preceding 12 months , except for the cervical screening indicators where women should receive a total of three invitations for screening) 5. The patient has re gistered with the practice or has been newly diagnosed with the condition of interest in the preceding 3 months and has not rece ived the defined clinical measurements , e.g. blood pressure measurement 6. The patient has registered with the practice or has been newly diagnosed with the condition of interest in the preceding 9 months and has not achieved the defined clinical standards , e.g. blood pressure control within target levels. It is recognised that patients may meet more than one of these criteria and in these circumstances all reasons for personalisation should be recorded in the patient' s record to facilitate safe and effective p atient care. However, as a patient can only be acknowledged as having a personalised care adjustment once within the Business Rules for a given indicator, they will be allocated to the first criterion they meet in the hierarchy listed above. For example, w here a patient is recorded as having registered with the practice in the preceding 3 months and has also chosen not to receive the intervention described in the indicator they would be identified in the Business R ules as having chosen not to receive the ca re. The hierarchy listed above seeks to prioritise clinical judgement and patient choice over other criteria. Applying this hierarchy consistently in the Business Rules in conjunction with the recording changes d escribed below will support better attribut ion of the reason for care being personalised, allowing for more meaningful conversations between clinicians, commissioners and regulators. Interpretation and recording of the personalised care adjustment The interpretation of these categories and how the y should be recorded is detailed further below. The investigative service or secondary care service is unavailable This care adjustment will apply only to the following indicators: HF00 5, AST00 6, COPD008 and DM014. 117 Where one of these services is unavailable this should be recorded using specific codes which state that the service is unavailable. The contractor is expected to explore fully with their CCG, if a suitable investigative or secondary s ervice could be commissioned for the patient prior to entering a service unavailable code in the patient record. The frequency with which service unavailable codes should be added to the patient record is noted below and may vary between indicators. Some c odes may need to be entered annually whereas others may only need to be entered once in the relevant timeframe stated in the indicator. Table 2 : Frequency of data entry Indicator ID Service unavailable may be recorded HF00 5 Within 6 months of diagnosis of heart failure AST00 6 Within 6 months of diagnosis of asthma COPD008 Requ ired each year the patient becomes eligible for pulmonary rehabilitation DM014 Within 279 days of diagnosis of diabetes Intervention described in the indicator is clinically unsuitable We envisage this being the main reason for personalisation of care, recognising the importance of clinical judgement in determining the applicability of guideline recommendations to individual patients. This category enc apsulates the historical exception reporting criteria of 1) patients for whom it is not appropriate to review their chronic disease parameters due to particular circumstances , e.g. receiving end of life care, 2) those who are on maximal tolerated doses of medication, 3) those who have an allergy, contraindication or adverse reaction to medication, 4) those who have not tolerated medications and 5) where the patient has a supervening condition which would make treatment of their condition inappropriate. This criterion will be supported by both generic 'patient unsuitable' codes which will apply to all indicators in the clinical area (except for indicators VI001, VI002 and VI003) and more specific codes which can be attributed to single indicators. Indicators in the Vaccination and Immunisation domain will be supported by specific codes for clinical unsuitability for a vaccination. Over time, more specific codes will be introduced which define the clinical reasons which might make the intervention clinically u nsuitable for an individual patient. Codes which indicate ongoing and permanent reasons for personalisation of care such as allergies to specified medication may be entered once in the medical record. Other codes will need to be recorded on an annual basis following an individual patient review of the applicability of the intervention described in the indicator. 118 It is not acceptable to exclude all patients who are under the care of a consultant. Each case needs to be carefully considered and all reasonable efforts made to provide optimal care. Even when a patient is under the care of a consultant only, the contractor should ensure it has evidence that all the requirements of the contract have been carried out. If this evidence is not available, the contract or should assume that the action has not been carried out and either fulfil the requirements of the relevant indicator(s) or obtain evidence from secondary care that the particular test/check has been carried out. Where the secondary care clinician, in agr eement with the primary care clinician, has exercised clinical judgement and decided further action or testing is inappropriate, this should be noted in the patient record. A personalised care adjustment may them be applied. The patient has chosen not to r eceive the intervention described in the indicator This criterion requires that there has been a personal contact or a discussion recorded in the patient record which ideally notes the reasons for the intervention being declined. This contact may be face -to-face, video conferencing or telephone contact between a health professional and the patient. This criterion will be supported by both generic 'informed dissent' codes which will apply to all indicators in the clinical area and more specific codes which c an be attributed to single indicators. Practices are encouraged to use more specific codes where they are available. The decision to decline a QOF intervention should be reviewed with the patient on an annual basis and recorded annually if necessary. The exceptions to this are indicators CS005 and CS006 where the choice not to receive the intervention need only be entered once during the time -period stated in the indicator. However, as noted in the underpinning principles, good practice woul d be to revisit this decision on a regular basis. Women who choose to withdraw from the cervical screening call/recall will receive no further offers of screening from the central screening service. The patient has not responded to invitations for the inte rvention described in the indicator To be removed from an indicator denominator using this criterion patients must have been sent a minimum of two invitations for QOF care at two unique time points in the QOF year , i.e. 1 April to 31 March separated by a minimum of seven calendar days. The exceptions to this are indicators CS005 and CS006 where the patient should have been sent a minimum of three invitations at three unique time points during the timeframe stipulated in the indicator. However, care should continue to be offered on an opportunistic basis where appropriate. General standards and recording requirements for invitations Many different methods of communication are already available to invite patients for QOF care and these are likely to expand wi th the ongoing development of digital technology. The NHS also has a legal duty to ensure that patients who have a disability, impairment or sensory loss get information that they can access and 119 understand as set out in the Accessible Information Standard.127 The first step to making an effective invitation for care therefore is that it is made in a manner which is accessible to the patient. Therefore, practices should prospectively and opportunistically record individual patients preferred methods of communic ation, for example at the time of the next patient contact. Where a preferred contact method is recorded this would be used to make the first invitation for care. The second invitation may be via any method. All invitations should be personalised to the pa tient, i.e. use their name and specify what they are being invited for. Where invitations are being sent via letter or email these should also include information for the patient as to why this care is being offered and its importance for their health care . Invitations should be coded at the time they are sent to the patient. For data extraction purposes, ther e should be a minimum of seven calendar days between each invitation, but practices should use their judgement in determining the optimal spacing betw een invitations for their practice population. A longer period may be more appropriate. Codes currently exist to indicate the communication method used to make the invitation and that the patients preferred method was used. Both will be acceptable for QOF purposes. Patients should be sent a minimum of two invitations for care within the QOF year , i.e. 1 April - 31 March. If these invitations are correctly coded then they will be identified through the business rules and there will be no need to add addition al codes at year -end to indicate that a pati ent has not responded to these invitations. As at present, generic invitations such as messages added to the right -hand side of prescriptions or notices in the waiting room inviting groups of patients to attend clinics or make appointments will not be acceptable. Invitations for cervical screening As noted above, the requirement for women to be invited on three separate occasions will continue in line with national screening programme requirements. Therefore: In those areas where the first two invitation s are sent via the central screening service, then contractors are responsible for offering the third invitation, or Where the central screening service sends out only one letter, then contractors are responsible for offering the second and third invitation. Where contractors have opted to run their own call/recall system then they are responsible for making all three invitations. Where a woman does not respond to these three invitations then contracto rs will need to code that this has been the case . Each invitation should be recorded in the patient record as evidence of these may be required for assessment and audit purposes. 127 https://www.england.nhs.uk/ourwork/accessibleinfo/ 120 Women may choose to withdraw from the national screening programme. This shou ld be undertaken with caution as women who withdraw from cervical screening call/recall will receive no further offers of screening from the central service. Where women actively decline cervical screening, this should be re corded as such. The patient has registered with the practice or been newly diagnosed with the condition in the last 3 months of the QOF year and has not received defined clinical measurements Where a patient newly registers with a practice or is newly diagnosed with a clinical condition in the last three months of the QO F year (1 January - 31 March) this criterion applies automatically, unless the contractor has recorded the defined clinical measurements within the timeframe for the indicator. This is because achievement automat ically over -rides any PCA. The patient has registered with the practice or has been newly diagnosed with the condition in the last 9 months of the QOF year and has not achieved defined clinical standards Where a patient newly registers with a practice or i s newly diagnosed with a clinical condition in the last nine months of the QOF year (1 July - 31 March) this criterion applies automatically, unless the contractor has achieved the defined clinical standards within the timeframe for the indicator. This is because achievement automatically over -rides any PCA. 121 Section 7: Indicators no longer in QOF (INLIQ) There are no changes to the INLIQ extraction from 1 April 202 1.
