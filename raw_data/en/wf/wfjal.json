We have conducted thousands of tests and terpenes rarely show up in the edible products. Mandating that test for edibles is truly a waste of time, money, and lab effort. One point would be is that terpenes are what distinct the Indica, Sativa and Hybrid in Cannabis and yet some producers are FALSE advertising and misleading consumers when they identify their Edible as Sativa or Indica. If there are no terpenes all you will have is THC and or CBD. Consumers flock to an Indica or Sativa label which if there are no Terpene Cannabinoids in the product, then all they are really purchasing is a product with THC. 2 - I would like to recommend that we use this opportunity to look to simplifying labels. In my opinion, the current label requirements are too detailed and simplifying the labels would be better for producers, but ultimately consumers as it would be easier for them to decipher. In my opinion, labels should only be required to contain the following: Total THC Content Total CBD Content Serving Size (If Applicable) Terpenes (If Applicable) Net Weight Production Run Number Expiration Date Ingredients Allergens +/-15% disclosure Producer Name & License No. Cannabis solvent disclosure (if applicable) All required warning statements. Example Current Label: Potency Info** Each unit in this Size: 1/10 Brownie 9.5224 mg THC/Serving Package 0 mg CBD/Package 95.224 mg THC/Package Net Weight: ~ 152g No terpenes were discovered in lab testing of this product. 1.6008 mg CBN/Serving 16.008 mg CBN/Package 0 mg CBG/Serving 0 mg CBG/Package 0 mg CBC/Serving 0 mg CBC/Package Production Run 1A40403000008FF000016445 Lot Number 1A40403000008FF000016205 Date FEB-04-2020 Final Testing Date 2Packaging Date FEB-07-2020 Best If Used By APR-04-2020 **This product may have a variance of \u00b115% of reported potency 1A40403000008FF000016445 Best If Used By APR-04-2020 **This product may have a variance of \u00b115% of the reported potency 3 - I would like someone to discuss with producers the need of scoring and demarking servings of THC for edibles >10mg. I feel scoring is what will break down a serving size and to have to place a 10mg marker on each seems redundant. For example a 100mg brownie with scoring will break into 10 units. 4 - METRC - Distributors should be exclusively responsible for inputting their routes, driver and vehicle information into metrc. Right now that responsibility falls on the producers and cultivators, however the distributors often change drivers after pickup or take routes as not depicted on the manifest. This compliance risk is not fair to the wholesalers as it is our duty to input and our liability if it is not followed by the distributors. 5 - The package weight entries on metrc manifests is redundant and unnecessary. It is not useful to deterring theft because the internal package contents are what matters. The tallying and entry of a shipment weight is excessive, causing extra an unnecessary work, and is hugely inefficient. If we all are able to eliminate redundancy and reduce costs, products can be more affordable and we can actually compete with \"illegal dealers\" in the market. The illegal market is sophisticated and could be selling millions per month in illegal and non taxed, tested products. Please see this particular account that is constantly promoting the sale of illegal brands. We have several accounts we are familiar with and would be more than happy to share them in an effort to curb the illegal presence in Nevada. 3https://instagram.com/stories/tattoosandsmoke/2329022438018883760?utm_source=ig_story_item_share&igshid=1g5 4myfdcs4nh I hope you find this information useful and would welcome the opportunity to have the department refer to us as a resource.

(WCCI) presents this Public Com- ment on the subject Proposed Regulations. This comment refers to the paragraph at 8.015(3)(b) which states: 8.015 Restrictions on access to facility and persons authorized on premises; location of cannabis growing at facility. 3. Each cannabis cultivation facility shall ensure that any cannabis growing at the cannabis cultivation facility: (b) Unless the cannabis cultivation facility cultivates cannabis outdoors, does not emit a strong odor that is detectable from outside the cannabis cultivation facili ty. The term \"odor\" or \"strong odor \" is not defined in Regulation 1. Since these terms are very subje ctive the enforcement of 8.015(3) (b) would be based on opinion and not objective facts. To address this issue the City of Las Vegas \"Odor Standard and Testing Protocol for Measuring Exterior Odors at Medical Mariju ana Cultivation and/or Production Facilit ies\" (enclosed) was written . It is required for Cannabis Cultivation and Production facilities under the City of Las Vegas Ordinance 9.40.040 - Medical marijuana odor nuisances. Cannabis Compliance Comments Page 2 June 13, 2020 Cannabis Compliance Comments 6 -13-20 WCCI recommends that a definition of odor be placed in Regulation 1 to clarify and assist in the enforcement of 8.015(3)(b). The follow ing would be appropriate: 1.132 \"Odor\" defined. \"Odor \" means volatilized chemical compound s that are gen- erally found in low concentrations that humans can perceive by their sense of smell. A \"strong odor \" as it relate s to volatile chemical compounds associated with Cannabis means detectable terpenes as identified outside a Cannabis Cultivation or Production facility using the City of Las Vegas \"Odor Standard and Testing Protocol for Measuring Exterior Odors at Medical Marijuana Cultivation and/or Production Facilities\" . Thank you for considering this Pub lic Comm ent. Should you have any questions or comments regarding this letter , please do not hesitate to call. At Your Service , WALSH CERTIFIED CON SULTANTS, INC. Dale W. Walsh, To: CCB Regulations Subject: Question for Cannabis Compliance Board Meeting on June 18th, 2020 Follow Up Flag: Follow up Flag Status: Flagged To whom this may concern, I'm Josh Kasoff, a journalist and Secretary for Nevada NORML. Over the past few months I've been producing a series called \"Irregulators\", in which I present evidence for our NORML News segments about the scandals and misdeeds surrounding Department of Taxation, including but not limited to; the strictness and costliness of the Marijuana Agent Card when compared to other states, the almost endless amount of lawsuits the department has been involved in and the questionable nature in which cannabis cultivation licenses were allocated. However, they're notoriously non-transparent when it comes to their operations and unwilling to speak with the media on most occasions. Because I believe in fair and honest journalism and not letting \"Irregulators\" just serve as a smear piece of the Department of Taxation, I've attempted multiple times to contact the DOT to allow them to fairly respond to the evidence I've presented, yet have never received a response once. My question for the meeting on June 18th is this: Will the newly formed Cannabis Compliance Board be more transparent about their operations and open to speak with and inform the media and respond to their questions on their operations instead of cannabis consumers/employees finding out about their operations through exposes done by The Nevada Current? As a cannabis consumer and employee affairs reporter, I find it of utmost importance that the regulatory body is willing to speak with the media so those consumers and employees stay informed. Thank you and have a great day. I'm looking forward to the meeting on the 18th. -- Josh Kasoff Secretary of Nevada NORML http://txcannaco.com/author/joshkasoff/ https://potportal.net/author/josh-kasoff-nevada-norml/ https://cannabismagazine.com/author/josh-kasoff/ https://dopemagazine.com/author/joshua-kasoff/ 2 To help protect your privacy, Microsoft Office prevented automatic download of this picture from the Internet. June 15, 2020 Cannabis Compliance Board State of Nevada Department of Taxation RE: Cannabis Compliance Board Regulatory Workshop - June 18, 2020 Dear Chair and Cannabis Compliance Board Members, I am Randy Querry, Director of Government Relations for the American Association for Laboratory Accreditation (A2LA). I have been involved with laboratory accreditation for well over two decades. On behalf of the A2LA, I am commenting on the proposed Regulation 11 - Cannabis Testing Facilities. By way of background, A2LA is a nonprofit, accreditation body with over 3700 actively accredited certificates representing all 50 states including over sixty organizations accredited for cannabis testing. We have been granting accreditation to testing laboratories in various industries since 1979. The criteria forming the basis for our laboratory accreditation program is ISO/IEC 17025 General requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories. We ourselves, as an accreditation body, have been evaluated against rigorous standards in providing this accreditation service and are recognized globally as an International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC) recognized accreditation body. In establishing a state cannabis program, testing and the ensuing test results, are critical to the program. Regular laboratory assessments leading to accreditation, will provide the users of the test reports with confidence that the data is backed by a quality management system, technically competent testing, qualified personnel, and the use of the appropriate facilities and testing equipment. We strongly support your regulations in requiring ISO/IEC 17025 Accreditation through an ILAC signatory as required in section 11.025. However, we are respectfully requesting clearer language specific to section 11.020 that now reads: 2. \"Each cannabis testing facility that claims to be accredited must provide the Board with copies of each annual inspection report from the accrediting organization, including without limitation, any deficiencies identified in and any corrections made in response to the report.\" In general, the current practice is not to conduct annual onsite inspections. What is the expected scope of work for these assessments? That is, are they to include an assessment to all of the criteria and all testing each year? Are the accreditation bodies to conduct full, onsite assessments of the management system requirements and all of the testing capabilities? To ensure a consistent assessment approach by all accreditation bodies we encourage that this be defined. We would be pleased to provide more background and elaborate on our comments at your convenience. If interested please contact me at rquerry@A2LA.org. Sincerely, Randall Querry Director of Government Relations, A2LA 1Amber Virkler From: Dwayne 2:28 PM To: CCB Regulations Subject: Comments on Proposed Regulations. Follow Up Flag: Follow up Flag Status: Flagged I noticed that vapor products are not mentioned in any of the regulations. For marijuana production facilities that extract concentrated cannabis, for vape products, do we have to abide by NRS 370 regulations? NRS 370.054 defines vapor products as: 1. Means any noncombustible product containing nicotine or any other substance that employs a heating element, power souce, electronic circuit or other electronic, chemical or mechanical means, regardless of the shape or size thereof, that can be used to produce vapor from nicotine or any other substance in a solution or other form, the use or inhalation of which simulates smoking. I was contacted by the Dept of Taxation, Alcohol & Tobacco division, stating that we had to obtain a tobacco license. Please let me know if marijuana vape products are required to have a tobacco license a lso or is it covered under the cannabis regulations.

Dwayne Carr 702-610-4844 Cell 702-665-6979 Office http://leaflink.com/menu/w-vapes To: The Cannabis Compliance BoardFrom: Mona Lisa the Medical Cannabis Patients of NevadaDate Submitted: 6-17-2020Re: Additional Testimony for the 6-18 Workshop on the CCB's Initial Regulation(s) The Cannabis Compliance Board is now the third regulatory body to be tasked with the responsibility to create and affect industry over-sight. Medical cannabis patients have weathered the enormous battle of having been rushed through two entirely different state departments, each hurriedly creating new regulations in preparation for the windfall of the states recreational marijuana sales. It forced the vulnerable medical cannabis patients into an awkward fighting stance as we desperately tried to protect consumer safety while simultaneously trying to preserve cannabis patients rights. The written testimony electronically submitted on 6-9-2020 addresses all the specific CCBR verbiage Nevadas medical cannabis patients most want to see revised before adoption of these regulations. And we mean to be VERY clear in stating that ALL PENALTIES FOR ALL CATEGORIES OF VIOLATION SHOULD BE MORE STRINGENT but weve not come to tell you how to do that part of your job. Creating the administrative and legal framework necessary to establish industry compliance is THE most important task as far as weve seen, and patients earnestly believe the CCB should work it out amongst its esteemed colleagues.But the fact these regulations will make it impossible for medical cannabis patients to be granted ANY legislative help from the Board without first retaining a lawyer and paying what is (to us) an exorbitant amount of money, that is a terrific slap in the face to the very people whove needed you most. Weve fought for the right things for all these years, without compensation, in order to help the industry prioritize its most important issues while also tirelessly campaigning to manifest this very Compliance Board. Patients have done everything possible to help our community in setting things up right because our sickest patients desperately need help and by God, I hope you all mean to provide some.I cannot imagine how you would purposely write regulations that clearly spell out the demise of ANY involvement from TRUE patient advocates at the earliest stage of your policy development. You can all pat yourselves on the backs for having done what no other regulatory body had the lack of heart to do... Youve figuratively slit the throat of all medical cannabis patient by spelling out how we may NOT receive ANY of your help unless by a very limited, and well-funded exception. So now the score for us reads like this: Medical cannabis patients can no longer seek help from our legislators and now well not be able to seek help from you, per the following regulations as written. Page 18Regulation 2.025 Board Meetings.3.) Requests for special meeting will be granted only upon a showing of exceptional circumstances. The Board may require that a person requesting a special meeting pay the costs associated with such meeting, in addition to those costs usually assessed against an applicant, license, or registrant.Page 33Regulation 4.140 Declaratory orders and advisory opinions.1.) Any applicant for licensure or licensed cannabis establishment may obtain a determination or advisory opinion from the Board as to the applicability of any provision of chapters 678A through 678D of NRS or any regulation adopted pursuant thereto by bringing a petition for a declaratory ruling before the Board. No other person or entities may petition the Board for a declaratory ruling. Page 34 & 35As written, the entirety of Regulation 4.145 Adoption, amendment or repeal of a regulation.Surely youre aware honest-to-goodness medical cannabis patients can absolutely not afford the fees associated with the Boards $500 application fee and all the costs to pay the lawye(s) who must also be courageous in willing to fight our battles against huge money.But before patients are officially refused all help, I hope the Board takes into serious consideration exactly WHAT the medical cannabis patients have been fighting for all these years. Consumer safety and patient protection are the ONLY things weve wanted from ANY of these people. How terrible that we, the actual cannabis patients who need you most, we should be systematically rejected all help by money-interested politicians. We were then refused help from Nevadas health and tax regulators (who would all go to work in the private sector immediately after playing their part in cannabis regulation), and now for the third and final time it seems, Nevadas medical cannabis patients are effectively being blocked from finding help to remedy in an amenable process of corrective cannabis legislation. And, by the exact same (highly experienced) industry lobbyists whove been allowed to silence the public and the medical patients, after all. If earnest cannabis patients are never again to be heard by this Board, let me take this last opportunity to beg for cannabis consumer safety by requesting this very slight, but important and very meaningful revision to Regulation 8.On page 78Regulation 8.010 Required written disclosure with each lot of usable cannabis;1.) A cannabis cultivation facility must disclose in writing with each lot of usable cannabis provided to a cannabis sales facility (a) All soil amendments, fertilizers, pesticides, and other crop production aids applied to the growing medium or cannabis plant included in the lot giving the timetable to which they were applied, andNevadans who are sick and use cannabis as a matter of medicinal requirement, have long prayed there would come to be a cannabis regulatory board that would care to recognize our vulnerable patients real life requirements (we were long ago promised medical cannabis). Yet once again, its been clearly demonstrated in these latest rounds of cannabis regulations that there will be no inclusion in any capacity for honest non-business interested people to find protective measures. Effectively regulating a system which exclusively panders to cannabis opportunists who have the money to spend expanding business licensing opportunities for personal gain, while making sure the Board ignores REAL medical cannabis patient input, is what youre doing and it means NO ONE is going to fix what the cannabis industry lobbyists purposely set into motion (in an entirely exclusive manner) because it best suits their bottom line.Go gure that Nevada's \"gold standard\" cannabis regulations meant purposely seeing our honest medical patients undone. So you can bet we're mad and we want you to know it! 1 Proposed Regulations of the Cannabis Compliance Board (May 29, 2020) Inputs Submitted by G3 Labs, LLC (L007) Item Page Current Text Comments 1 15 1.155.3(b) \"...74oF (24 oC);...\" Please modify the text to: \"...74o+4 oF (24 o+2.2 o C);...\" The designated temperature needs to have an allowed range.

As written, there is no designation for a custodian. As observed, there is only the Agent's signature on the evidence seal. As such, the \"chain-\u00adof-\u00adcustody\" could only go from the Agent to the receiving party. 4 23 4.050.1(a)(1) \"Transporting cannabis in an unauthorized vehicle;\" Please clarify that this rule is not applicable to testing facilities. Samplers from testing facilities may use more than one vehicle. Apparently it is not feasible to \"authorize\" all the potential vehicles unless the authorization is granted by the responsible cannabis establishment. 5 24 4.050.1(a)(18) \"... storing cannabis from an unlicensed source...\" Please exempt patient samples and/or public verification samples (purchased from cannabis sales facilities) from this requirement. 6 38 5.075.3 \"Board Agents may enter...at any Please modify text to \"Board Agents may enter...at any time 2 time...\" during operation...\" Cannabis facilities such as testing labs do not operate 24/7 (anytime). 7 53 6.025.1 \"The Board may charge and collect a fee from any cannabis establishment that is involved in a complaint...\" Cannabis establishment shall not be charged fees when the complaint submitted is unsubstantiated. As written, \"tort\" complaints (even absent of malice) will cost an establishment the \"fees\" and potentially jeopardize the financial for the establishment, especially if deluged with frivolous claims. 8 58 6.080.2 \"Except as otherwise...\" Please exempt patient samples. As written, patients cannot submit samples to cannabis testing facilities, a cannabis establishment, for testing. 9 63~64 6.085.6 & 7 related to \"security manager or director\" Please provide clear guidance for when and where the required courses are available to satisfy such training to be qualified as security manager or director. As written, a cannabis establishment will have difficulty evaluating the qualifications and implementing any required trainings. 10 64 6.087.2 \"Not allow a person who does not possess a cannabis establishment agent registration card which is valid at the cannabis establishment to:...(b)...(d)...\" Please clarify that these requirements are not applicable to service providers such as instrument/supplies vendors, electrician, plumber, construction labors, etc. 11 65 6.090.1(b) \"If working directly ...\" Please clarify that this requirement is not applicable to a testing facility. 12 68 6.115 \"Prohibition on treating or adulterating usable cannabis with chemical or other compound.\" Please specify that testing facilities are exempt from this section. Testing facilities conduct testing by treating or adulterating 3 usable cannabis with chemical or other compounds. 13 76 8.010.1 \"...(a) all soil amendments, fertilizer, ...\" The information should also be provided in writing to testing facilities too. 14 81 9.040.3 \"...shall perform testing, as specified by the Board, to determine the shelf life of ....\" Please clarify that how does the \"appropriate Board Agent\" determine the applicable protocols for shelf life testing? 15 92 11.015.1(b)&(c) Maintaining independence of testing facilities CCB regulations need to add language that will hold Cultivation/Production licensees (C/P) accountable for their invoices owed to testing facilities from conducted quality assurance tests within certain time period, such as 30 days. It is important to prevent situations where testing facilities inadvertently lose the independence. As much as every effort is being made by the testing facilities to be compliant as \"independent\", the non-\u00adpayment and aged account receivables from C/P are de facto having testing facilities to \"fund\" the operation of those C/P. 16 93 11.025.3 \"The Board may require an independent third party to inspect and/or...\" Please note that the Board should be responsible for the cost for such inspection and/or monitoring. Please provide assurance that the third party will not use information gleaned during such inspections to compete with the inspected lab. 17 93 11.025.5 \"The Board Agents or an independent third party ...\" Please note that the Board should be responsible for the cost for such inspection. Please provide assurance that the third party will not use information gleaned during such inspections to compete with the inspected lab. 18 95 11.040.4 \"To maintain continued licensure...with continued satisfactory Please modify the text to \"To maintain continued licensure...with continued satisfactory results in 4 performance as determined by the appropriate Board Agent.\" participation of proficiency testing program.\" \"Proficiency\" and \"performance\" should not be used interchangeably. And 11.040 details the satisfactory of proficiency testing, therefore it is not necessary to burden the \"Board Agent\" with the task to determine \"continued satisfactory.\" 19 95 11.040.8 \"successful participation includes an acceptable score for 100% of the target analytes...\" Please modify the 100% to 80%. What is the technical basis for using 100% as the acceptable score? In the case of proficiency testing, 100% does not represent better operations. Proficiency test is not to be used to evaluate performance. Many analytes have stability issue in PT samples (this is reported by the PT sample provider.) Requiring 100% is not practical. FDA requires 80% for clinical labs and EPA 75% for contract labs and laboratory accreditation as passing scores. 20 95 11.040.9 (b) \"Repeat the ...If the testing facility fails...that they will not recur.\" Please delete this paragraph. Over-\u00adreliance on proficiency test results to evaluate laboratory quality or individual proficiency is considered as unacceptable by the National Institute of Standards and Technology and should be avoided when administering proficiency tests. Further, matrix-\u00adbased PTs are only offered at most twice a year. Requiring repeat in 30 days, is impossible to achieve. 21 100 11.050.3 \"...A sample of a production run must be the lesser of 1 percent of the total Please add text \"... for concentrates, minimum of 5 grams of a production run is required.\" 5 weight of the production run or 25 units of product.\" This requirement, as written, is not feasible to sample concentrates. There was an instruction sent to the labs for sampling amount. Please use the same language from that instruction. 22 100 11.050.5 \"...weighed within 2 hours after harvest.\" Please clarify that what assurance could testing facilities obtain on the \"2 hours\" rule is followed? Without such assurance, testing facilities cannot be held responsible to be compliant on this requirement since it is included in Regulation 11. 23 101 11.050.7 \"...shall...within 2 business days after obtaining the results.\" Please modify the text to \"...shall...within 2 business days after the final certificate of analysis become available...\" Changing will allow time for data review/validation and actions required for seed-\u00adto-\u00adsale system (METRC.) 24 102 11.070.1(d) \"...testing facility shall document...on the sample package...\" Please modify the text to \"...testing facilities shall ensure the correct METRC label is adhere to the sample package.\" To \"document\" such information on the sample package is not feasible due to the sampling location set up and the difficulty of doing so physically. 25 104 11.075.1 \"...aw...\" Please modify the text and spell out \"aw\" as \"water activity\" 26 105 11.075.9 \"If a sample passes the same quality assurance test upon retesting...need not destroy the lot or production run...\" Please clarify that what if the retest samples failed on the different category of the quality assurance test. In addition, what assurance is there for the retest to be \"better\" than the original test? Should a further retest allowed or the associated lot/production run be destroyed? 27 105 11.080 \"Collection and testing of random Please clarify that in the case where no \"retention samples\" 6 samples from cannabis establishments for comparison with results reported by testing facilities....\" available, what type of assurance is there to prevent any contamination occur after the original sample was collected and analyzed?

I f the Board adopt s the Proposed Regulations as is, the Board will exceed its grant of authority and broade n its scope of power in direct violation of various statut ory and constitutional p rovisions. A substantial portion of the provisions c ontained in Proposed Regulations 1 - 12 are un lawfu l, and if adopted, will be invalidated and repea led, to include, but not limited to, Regulatio ns 1.095, 1.145, 2.020, 2.055 , 2.065, and 4.010, and also 5.115, 6.015, 6.025, and 6.040. Let this letter shall serve as notice to the Board and Commission that these regulations are not lawful, and if adopted, will be invalidated and/or repealed. The Cannabis Compliance Board is an administrative agency under the direction of the Executive branch, whose role it is to execute the laws, not make them. The provisions contained in the Pro posed Regulations expand the power of this Board in v iolation of its authorizing statutes . The statut ory provisions of Title 56 of NRS already proscribe the prohibited acts, violations, and penalties that pertain to the licens ing and commercial productio n of cannabis, and the Board is not authorized to further expand t hose acts, violation s, or penalties . The Board is authorized to promulgate regulations which carry out the ir statutory provisions through procedur al guidelines and rules to follow - they are not meant to expand them in substance. The qualifications and requireme nts of licensees and agents are likewise proscribed and can also not be expanded as the Bo ard has done here . I hereby request the Board amend the Proposed Regulations to conform with its statutory grant of authority, and to work with Legislative Counsel to ensure such compliance. \"All cannabis Page 3 of 3 establishments and cannabis establishment agents must therefore be licensed, con trolled, and assisted to protect the public healt h, safety, morals, good order and general welfare of the inhabitants of the State, to foster the stability and success of the cannabis industry and to preserve the competitive economy and policies of free competition of the State of N evada.\" This is the spirit of the law that was passed by the p eople of this State, yet the P roposed Regulations directly hinder such creative economy and free competition.

Minnesota, Suite J Creating results for clients throughout the Silver State Carson City, Nevada 89703 June 17, 2020 To: Chairman and Members of the Cannabis Compliance Board From: Will Adler, Principal, Silver State Government Relations Representing Scientists for Consumer Safety Please accept the following summary of the detailed comments that were submitted on June 9, 2020 making multiple recommendation to Sections 4, 6 and 11 of the NCCR regulations. Section 11. - Cannabis Testing Laboratories Publication of seed-to-sale tracking data Change \"may\" to \"shall\" regarding posting Metrc data and COA's in NCCR 11.070(13). 11.070(13): The Board shall publish, in digital format compatible with statistical analysis, on their website all Certificates of Analysis issued to them in the preceding month on the first of each month. Retesting It is the opinion of SCS that no retest ever invalidates a previously failed quality assurance test and that all tests results are valid even if retested differently. Regulation 11.075 should be rewritten to include a new sub section 7: The cannabis testing facility selected to perform the retest, shall contact the cannabis cultivation or production facility to arrange the collection of a new sample for testing. Upon arrival at the cultivation or production facility, the cannabis testing facility selected to perform the retest will be shown into the facility and escorted to the lot or batch that they are retesting. The cannabis testing facility selected to perform the retest will sample from the previously failed lot using their full sampling and homogeneity protocols. The cannabis testing facility selected to perform the retest will collect the new sample prior to obtaining the previously retained sample on site. The initially retained sample and the newly collected sample will be packaged in unique packaging and identified respectively. The cannabis testing facility selected to perform the retest will then test the previously retained and the newly collected sample using its standard testing protocols. The Board will consider the average score from each test performed to determine whether the sample will be declared safe for sale. If the average score of the three tests performed is below the limit for the quality assurance test previously failed, the test will then be declared safe and safe for sale.

Minnesota, Suite J Creating results for clients throughout the Silver State Carson City, Nevada 89703 Proficiency testing (NCCR 11.040(8)) Successful participation includes an acceptable score for 85% of analyte that the cannabis testing facility reports to include quantitative results when applicable. An acceptable score of 75% or greater but less than 85% will require corrective action but not a full retesting of the lab's proficiency. Random Laboratory Assurance Checks (RLAC) 11.085 as presented should be replaced in its entirety with regulations that create a functional system of Random Laboratory Assurance Checks (RLAC). A functional RLAC shall randomly audit every cannabis lab in the state four times per year. The Board shall send agents to each laboratory, unannounced. Those agents will select at least 5 retained samples of products already submitted to the seed to sale tracking system with final Certificates of Analysis (COA). With the board investigators present, the cannabis laboratory will run a retest, including all quality assurance and cannabinoid tests, on the board's selected retained samples of a product. The results of the retest must have 80% of the retests producing results within 20% of the original test result. All quality assurance test results shall be the same as originally submitted on the COA. Any laboratory that fails the RLAC audit shall be classified as having submitted intentionally false statements. Two failed RLACs within 24 months shall qualify as a Category 1 violation and may be accompanied by the revocation of the laboratory's license. Section 4. - Disciplinary and Other Proceedings Before the Board Criminality: Past disciplinary actions need to be maintained. 4.010 Applicability. NCCR 4 shall apply to disciplinary proceedings governed by NRS 678A.500 to 678A.640. Unless otherwise ordered by the Chair, this regulation shall apply to all such proceedings that are pending on the effective date of this regulation. All previously accrued penalties (Category I-V) assigned by the Marijuana Enforcement Division will remain with the license the violation was assigned to and will be regarded as a previous penalty if any subsequent violations occur in the next three years. Section 6. - Production and Distribution of Cannabis Security measures (NCCR 6.085(6) & (7)) This section of the regulations should be modified to exclude laboratories to reflect the reality that laboratories do not have the same risks as the rest of the cannabis market. Laboratories are not targeted for robberies as they carry very small amounts of marijuana product and rarely have any cash on site. In addition, laboratories should be exempt from all additional security requirements in reference to security managers and on-site security personnel. CEIC Nevada Las Vegas, Nevada contact@ceicnv.org www.CEICNV.org STATE OF NEVADA CANNABIS COMPLIANCE BOARD Via Email: regulations@ccb.nv.gov RE: Proposed State of Nevada Regulations of the Cannabis Compliance Board (CCB) Dear CCB Members, Thank you for the opportunity to review and provide comment on the proposed State of Nevada Regulations for cannabis. CEICNV (Cannabis Equity and Inclusion Coalition) focuses on ensuring the cannabis industry in Nevada is inclusive of people whom were disenfranchised by the war on drugs. We believe we are the only organization in the State that can assist the CCB in an advisory capacity as it relates to inclusion and community engagement with those communities that were most harmed by the war on drugs. CEIC appreciates this opportunity to assist the Board as it develops a new regulation for the cannabis industry. We look forward to assisting the board as it develops rules to address the issues in the cannabis industry. CEIC respectfully submits the following comments: We look forward to the CCB adhering to the following bill AB 533 Sec.64: The Board may adopt regulations necessary or convenient to carry out the provisions of this title. Such regulations may include, without limitation: (a)Financial requirements for licensees. (b) Establishing such investigative and enforcement mechanisms as the Board deems necessary to ensure the compliance of a licensee or registrant with the provisions of this title. (c)Requirements for licensees or registrants relating to the cultivation, processing, manufacture, transport, distribution, testing, study, advertising and sale of cannabis and cannabis products. (d)Policies and procedures to ensure that the cannabis industry in this State is economically competitive, inclusive of racial minorities, women and persons and communities that have been adversely affected by cannabis prohibition and accessible to persons of low income seeking to start a business. (e)Policies and procedures governing the circumstances under which the Board may waive the requirement to obtain a registration card pursuant to this title for any person who holds an ownership interest of less than 5 percent in any one cannabis establishment or an ownership interest in more than one cannabis establishment of the same type that, when added together, is less than 5 percent.(f)Reasonable restrictions on the signage, marketing, display and advertising of cannabis establishments. Such a restriction must not require a cannabis establishment to obtain the approval of the Board before using a logo, sign or advertisement. (g) Provisions governing the sales of products and commodities made from industrial hemp, as defined in NRS 557.160, or containing cannabidiol by cannabis establishments. 2. The Board shall adopt regulations providing for the gathering and maintenance of comprehensive demographic information, including, without limitation, information regarding race, ethnicity, age and gender, concerning each:(a)Owner and manager of a cannabis establishment. (b)Holder of a cannabis establishment agent registration card. 3. The Board shall transmit the information gathered and maintained pursuant to subsection 2 to the Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau for transmission to the Legislature on or before January 1 of each odd numbered year. 4. The Board shall, by regulation, establish a pilot program for identifying opportunities for an emerging small cannabis business to participate in the cannabis industry. As used in this subsection, \"emerging small cannabis business\" means a cannabis related business that: (a) Is in existence, operational and operated for a profit; (b) Maintains its principal place of business in this State; and Satisfies requirements for the number of employees and annual gross revenue established by the Board by regulation. 1Amber Virkler From: Benjamin Chew <Ben.Chew@dblabslv.com> Sent: PM To: CCB Regulations Subject: Public comments for NCCR regulations Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on the proposed NCCR regulations. Regulation: 1.155 \"Potentially hazardous cannabis products 1. \"Potentially hazardous cannabis products and ingredients\" means an edible item that is natural or synthetic and that requires temperature control because the item is in a form capable of supporting: (a) The rapid and progressive growth of infectious or toxigenic microorganisms; (b) The growth and toxin production of Clostridium botulinum; or (c) In raw shell eggs, the growth of Salmonella enteritidis. 2. The term includes, without limitation: (a) An animal item that is raw or heat-treated; (b) An item of plant origin that is heat-treated or consists of raw seed sprouts; (c) Cut melons and tomatoes; (d) Garlic-in-oil mixtures that are not modified in a way that results in mixtures which prohibit growth; and (e) Whipped and/or infused butter. 3. The term does not include: (a) An ingredient with a value of water activity of not more than 0.85; (b) An ingredient with a pH level of not more than 4.6 when measured at 75\u00b0F (24\u00b0C); or (c) An ingredient, in a hermetically sealed and unopened container, that is commercially processed to achieve and maintain commercial sterility under conditions of nonrefrigerated storage and distribution. Response: Please clarify. If a product is hermetically sealed (e.g., a beverage), does this mean that the lab does not run pH or water activity? Does the product need to be hermetically sealed prior to submission to the lab? Section 11.070 1(b) states that \"immediately before packaging\", samples are to be submitted for testing. Therefore, the lab may receive bulk samples prior to them being hermetically sealed. If the customer declares they will hermetically seal the sample per the above conditions, is the sample exempted from pH and water activity? Regulation: 1.165 \"Production run\" defined. extraction of concentrated cannabis by a cannabis establishment, the combination of one or more lots used to make the same product in one homogenous mixture produced using the same method which results in not more than 2.2 pounds of concentrated cannabis. 2. For the production of cannabis products by a cannabis production facility, one homogenous mixture produced at the same time using the same method and which may include a combination of concentrated cannabis and other materials for the production of cannabis products. 2 Response: The way this is written, a production facility could combine multiple concentrates made in (1) and then use that to make an enormous batch in (2). The concern is whether the amount tested by a lab is representative of the entire batch. Given the homogeneity requirements, the lab cannot just blend everything together to get an average measurement for potency. Each piece needs to be analyzed separately, and running potency 100 times per submission is not feasible. The amount of cannabis products in a production run should be limited to what can be made using up to 2.2 lbs of concentrated cannabis. For instance, if the facility has large enough equipment, 2.2 lbs = 1 kg of oil. If the oil is 80% THC, then this could be used to make 80,000 gummies at 10 mg/gummy or 8000 chocolate bars at 100 mg/bar. If a production facility wants to combine smaller runs of concentrated cannabis that have been tested previously, they can, if they have a process to homogenize the concentrates, and the limit on the final size is 2.2 lbs. Regulation: 11.040 8. Successful participation includes an acceptable score for each and every target analyte that the cannabis testing facility reports to include quantitative results when applicable. 9. A testing facility who fails to achieve an acceptable score for a required quality assurance test shall: (a) Notify the appropriate Board Agent in writing within 24 hours. (b) Repeat the proficiency testing of any failed tests within 30 calendar days or as otherwise approved by the appropriate Board Agent. If the testing facility fails to perform satisfactorily for the same required quality assurance test in two consecutive proficiency testing events, or two out of three proficiency testing events, the testing facility may be required to cease the performance of testing for those analytes until it demonstrates to the satisfaction of the appropriate Board Agent that the nonconformances have been corrected in such a manner as to ensure that they will not recur. Response What is the acceptable score? 80%? There are certain variations that are out of the laboratory controls: Samples can decompose during shipment due to temperature, shipment time etc. which is why PT suppliers allow for certain variations. A state run semi-annually (twice a year) Round Robin test, might prove to give better information then just repeating PTs. Round Robins are done on real samples by all the laboratories and provide a real measurement analysis. They determine reproducibility of a test method, and can help with verification of a new method. Regulation: 11.065 2. When performing pesticide residue analysis pursuant to NCCR 11.050, a cannabis testing facility shall analyze for the pesticides which occur on the list of pesticides published by the State Department of Agriculture pursuant to NRS 586.550 at the detection levels specified by the State Department of Agriculture and for any other substances required by the Board. If: 3(a) A pesticide which occurs on the list of pesticides published by the State Department of Agriculture pursuant to NRS 586.550 is detected at a level which exceeds the level specified by the State Department of Agriculture; or (b) A pesticide which does not occur on the list of pesticides published by the State Department of Agriculture pursuant to NRS 586.550 is detected in any amount which is positively verified, the pesticide residue analysis is failed. Response This is not a request to change the regulation, but a request to allow time to labs to meet the needs to meet any new list that may be issued. Under the current regulations, the monitoring list is issued by the NV Dept of Taxation, and this list is different from the list kept by NV Dept of Agriculture. The Agriculture list is currently much larger than the Taxation list. If the monitoring list for the labs will be changing, labs need ample time to verify they can meet the sensitivity requirements on flower and concentrates. Depending on the pesticides added to the monitoring list and the strictness of the regulatory limit, this could take months of work to validate the method. Please also note that many of the pesticides on the current NV Dept of Agriculture list are not easily measured and are exempt from tolerance on the existing list. Regulation: 6.085 7. Each cannabis establishment shall ensure that the security manager or director of the cannabis establishment, at least one employee of the cannabis establishment or the employees of any third party who provides security to the cannabis establishment has completed or will complete within three months of being hired, to be proven by written attestation from the employee and the training officer, the following training: (a) Training in theft prevention or a related subject; (b) Training in emergency response or a related subject; (c) Training in the appropriate use of force or a related subject that covers when the use of force is and is not necessary; (d) Training in the use and administration of first aid, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation; (e) Training in the protection of a crime scene or a related subject; (f) Training in the control of access to protected areas of a cannabis establishment or a related subject; (g) Not less than 8 hours of on-site training in providing security services; and (h) Not less than 8 hours of classroom training in providing security services. Response: This description for security was developed with input from the Nevada Dispensary Association, who did not consult with the laboratories or consider the different security issues the laboratories face. While there are similarities among the businesses, the fundamental difference between a lab and the others is the sheer volume of inventory kept on site. A laboratory normally collects a minimal amount of material for testing purposes, then disposes of that material through their retention policy. While a Cultivator, Producer, or Dispensary may have millions of dollars of product on hand, a laboratory has 4much less, and most of that has been processed in a laboratory setting that uses toxic chemicals. Most of the product on hand is unusable. Laboratories do not see the volume of public traffic entering the facility as in a Dispensary. The amount of cash stored at a laboratory is extremely low. In the past 2 years, we have reached out to the Department of Taxation to find appropriate training to meet this regulation. We were told that most places hire a security firm who supply 24-hour guards. This is an undue hardship on laboratories because the risk does not justify this. Laboratories have a fraction of the number of workers as the other facilities. Adding 3 full time equivalents for security can be 20-30% of the workforce. These reduced risk factors make having a professional guard (armed or unarmed) unnecessary at a laboratory. As such, a laboratory should be exempted from certain items above, specifically (c), (g), and (h). (c) Training in the appropriate use of force or a related subject that covers when the use of force is and is not necessary; This is training that a typical security guard would go through. A laboratory worker should never be expected to use force in any situation. (g) Not less than 8 hours of on-site training in providing security services; and (h) Not less than 8 hours of classroom training in providing security services. These are related to training for a security officer and should not apply to a laboratory. While general classes on basic security can be found, 8 hours of classroom and 8 hours of on-site training is excessive and unnecessary if the laboratory is not using a security guard. Regulation: 6.085 Required security measures, equipment and personnel; location of outdoor cultivation facility must allow for response by local law enforcement. 1. To prevent unauthorized access to cannabis at a cannabis establishment, the cannabis establishment must have: (a) One single secure entrance of the physical building; (b) No visible cannabis or cannabis products from outside the establishment. Response: One single secure entrance is difficult to have. 1. Not all equipment can fit through the front door of a facility. Loading docks and other entrances that facilitate item movement are needed. Large quantities of chemicals, gases, etc. should not be transported through a lobby. In addition, front entrances may not have a ramp, which makes it dangerous to attempt to move large objects or gas cylinders through that entrance. 2. Emergency exits are also part of the Fire Code. 2. Perhaps change this to \"All entrances to the b uilding must be secure, covered by security cameras, etc.\". That would cover emergency exits as well as other potential access points. 5 Regulation: 11.075 3. At the request of a cannabis cultivation facility or a cannabis product manufacturing facility, the appropriate Board Agent may, on a case-by- case basis, authorize a retest to validate the results of a failed test. The cannabis cultivation facility or cannabis product manufacturing facility is responsible for all costs involved in a retest performed pursuant to this section. 9. If a sample passes the same quality assurance test upon retesting, the cannabis cultivation facility or cannabis product manufacturing facility need not destroy the lot or production run and may sell the lot or production run to a cannabis cultivation facility, cannabis sales facility or cannabis product manufacturing facility, as applicable. Response: This is extremely problematic. This says that any negative retest will supersede any initial positive test. In effect, this is allowing testing until a negative result is found. The biggest problem with this is that microbial contamination is randomly distributed throughout the sample. The initial lab doing the testing is not necessarily wrong. If all controls are valid then that measurement is a snapshot of that portion of the sample that was tested. For an enumerated measurement such as Mold and Yeast, the retest numbers should be averaged with the first lab numbers. If the labs ran single samples or replicates, all of that should be averaged together for a final value. For example, if the first lab measured 13,000 and 17,000 for an average of 15,000 CFU/g and the second lab measured 8000 and 6000 for an average of 7000 CFU/g, then the state should gather all four measurements and show an average of 11,000 cfu/g. This is a more representative value of what the entire lot looks like. There can be low and high spots spread throughout the lot. For microbial contamination where the regulatory limit is detect/not detect, that is more complicated. The FDA BAM discusses sampling protocols for salmonella for various types of foods. https://www.fda.gov/food/laboratory-methods-food/bam-chapter-1-food-samplingpreparation-sample- homogenate Because the regulatory limits for aspergillus are similar to salmonella (Not Detected in 1 gram), this is an interesting discussion. FDA recognizes that the biological organisms are randomly distributed throughout the sample. FDA recommends that 15-60 samples be collected. Each of those samples are tested, and if any one sample fails, then the entire batch will fail. So, if the FDA allows for a 1 on 60 chance of failure to reject an entire crop, they are recognizing that it is extremely likely for other parts of the crop to show a negative result. The regulations as written say that a sample can be retested and if the retest comes back negative, then the state is declaring that the positive result is false. There is nothing in the regulations that would declare the negative result as false. For aspergillus testing, the protocols are complicated enough that there are many more reasons to obtain a false negative than a false positive result, and there is high probability that the sample the second lab tests is going to be different in terms of the microbiological contamination from the first lab. If the state is going to accept a negative result over any positive result, then a laboratory should just retest the sample until they find a negative result and report that. The state has allowed plating for aspergillus. There are 6currently, no plates available that are specific for these four species of aspergillus and no other mold/yeast. Plating would require that a lab be able to find 1 colony of aspergillus in potentially 10,000 colonies, a figurative needle in a haystack. There is no incentive for a laboratory to report a positive result. If they do, they will immediately lose a customer who will just go to a lab that will pass them using questionable methods. That laboratory will be able to hide behind the fact that microbes are randomly distributed and they just hit a \"clean\" spot. If all labs will then retest internally until a negative is found, then there is no point in testing for aspergillus or any other zero-tolerance regulatory limit. -- Benjamin G.M.

Washington Avenue Las Vegas, Nevada 89101 regulations@ccb.nv.gov Re: Proposed Regulations of the Cannabis Compliance Board To the Honorable Chair Douglas and Director Klimas: We write now to submit additional written comments with respect to the proposed Nevada Cannabis Compliance Regulations (\"NCCR\") published by Cannabis Compliance Board (the \"CCB\" or \"Board \") on May 29, 2020 in advance of the June 18, 2020 CCB Regulato ry Workshop. These comments are submitted with a reservation of rights to submit further, additional, or different comments as the proposed NCCR progress through the rulemaking process. We welcome the opportunity to provide further information or clarification that the Board may request. NCCR 6.087(2)(b) , (4). We appreciate the Board requiring those who work in the industry and handle cannabis to possess valid a gent cards. However, as written, this provision reaches an entire host of individuals that may or may not ever enter a cannabis establishment or handle cannabis. For example, this provision would require any person who provides services, such as an accou ntant, a custodian, or an attorney, to procure an agent card prior to providing those services to a cannabis establishment. F or that reason, we respectfully request that the Board narrow or strike this provision such that not every person who enter s into a contract with a cannabis establishment to provide services to that cannabis establishment be required to register as an agent and obtain an agent card. With respect to subpa rt (4), we respectfully request that th is provision specify an appropriate email address to which an establishment may remit written notice of a change i n status . This will aid the industry in com plying with notice requirements. Cannabis Compliance Board June 17, 2020 Page 2 NCCR 6.0 85(1)(a), (6), (7). Please consider exempting cannabis testing facilities , which are materially different from every other type of cannabis establish with respect to their opera tions as well as the amount of product or cash they may have on pre mises, from some of the requirements of this proposed regulation. Specif ically, with respect to subpart (1)(a), please consider allowing testing facilities to have more than one entrance . In addition, please consider exempting testing facilities from employing a se curity manager or director and/or the specific training requirements as set forth in subparts ( 6) and (7). NCCR 11.010(2). , NAC sets forth adequate qualifications for a scien tific director of a cannabis testing facility, striking the appropriate balance between academic achievement and real -world laboratory experience. Limiting the pool of potential scientific directors to only those individuals who have obtained a doctorate degree may render it impossib ly difficult to obtain and qualify an appropriate number of laboratories in the State of Nevada and will work at c ross-purposes with other goals to limit monopol y and promote diversity within the industry. However, i f the Board is inclined to adjust these requirements as ur ged by some commentators, it should similarly adjust the requirements of those Board agents and/or third parties who may audit , monitor , or inspect the scientific work of testing facilities and their directors. NCCR 11.025(3), (5) . We request clarification that the cost of third -party inspection and/or monitoring shall be not be borne by the testing facility. NCCR 11.050(5 ). This provision appropriately places the onus upon the submitting establishment with respect to the timing of harvesting and further process ing. Please clarify that a testing facility my rely upon the representation of the submitting facility that the cannabis has been provided within 2 hours of h arvest and has not undergone any further processing before being weigh ed. NCCR 11.075. We support the re -testing procedure set forth in this regulation, which has a proven track record under N AC 453A.672. It strikes the appropriate balance between ensuring that cannabis and cannabis products are safe for consumption while also ensuring that an entire lot of product is not destroyed unless and until a failed test is confirmed.

Such written policies and procedures must include, without limitation: (a) The procedures and methods available to a person seeking to report an instance of workplace discrimination or harassment; and (b) The procedures the licensed gaming establishment or ot her gaming business will follow when investigating a report of workplace discrimination or harassment. 2. The written policies and procedures required by this section shall address and apply to workplace discrimination or harassment, including, without l imitation, sexual harassment, committed by: (a) A person within the cannabis establishment , including, without limitation, an owner, manager, employee, or independent contractor; or (b) A person outside the cannabis establishment , including, without limi tation, a customer, client, vendor, contractor, consultant, or other person that does business with the organization. 3.

Any licensed cannabis establishment affected by such an administrative determination may request a hearing from the Board . Dear Cannabis Compliance Board, Thank you for the opportunity to provide feedback for the second edition of the proposed regulations. Please considered the following comments: 6.080 Section 8 a, b: Laboratories do not have the space to maintain hard copies of these records for 5 years. Laboratories should be required to have 1 year of records on site and allowed to store records 2 -5 years old off site. 7.025 : Please clarify this section. This sec tion contradicts 6.010 section 2 , which allows medical patients to purchase more than adult -use consumers. 11.040: Proficiency Testing: 3. Not all PT programs cover all analytes required for Nevada testing. Matrix -based PTs will not include every analy te but will evaluate sample preparation. Solvent -based PTs will likely have most to all required analytes present , but do not evaluate sample preparation. While we believe matrix -based PTs are the best evaluation of assays, it would not meet this requireme nt. 5. Add \"when possible\" due to issues previously raised about PT programs. PTs that do not evaluate sample preparation cannot be analyzed using the same procedures as routine samples. 7. Since various PT programs are not equal, this must be evalua ted when reviewing PT scores. If an analyte is not detected, is that missed result the same as correctly identifying the analyte as present , but producing an incorrect quantitative value? Please note analyte stability/solubility concerns mentioned in the f irst round of comments. 8. What is the definition of acceptable scores? Regulatory bodies such as CLIA use an acceptable score of 80%, while other sources such as the partnership for food protection laboratory task group has suggested corrective action for scores below 90%. Since we have assays with only 4 analytes (heavy metal s, residual solvents), we recommend using criteria of 7 5% and 85%. If a laboratory achieves a PT score above 85%, the assay is considered passing. If the assay PT score is between 7 5-84%, corrective action is required. If the score is less than 7 5%, result s are considered failing for that specific assay. 11.050 : We strongly support the Board's decision to move infused pre -rolls to the useable flower testing requirements and apply flower microbial testing limits. 11.050 : Please define \"Pathogenic E. coli\". Does this mean the \"big six\" plus O157? 11.050 : Remove Ochratoxin A from required testing. Ochratoxin A has significant stability issues making it difficult to keep high integrity QC standards. Ochratoxin is not commonly produced on cannabis. It is much more common in high starch products such as grains and corn. Therefore, it should be removed. 11.050 : Edible products: Edible products should be tested for total Yeast/Mold. 11.050 : Topical testing: Topicals should be tested for microbial contamination . 11.050 section 4 : We strongly support this standardization practice. 11.050 section 7 : Remove this reporting requirement. Since all products and inventory are in Metrc, th is is an unnecessary regulation. 11.070 section 13: We would like this language changed from \"may\" to \"shall\". We strongly support this increased transparency and believe all reported COAs should be available to the public. 11.075 section 9: Based on this language a retest sample that passes overrides a failing result. There is no scientific basis or merit to this system. Given the heterogeneity of cannabis, more rigorous controls must be put in place to ensure a retest sample is safe for public consumption. As such, we recommend adding a third sample to th e retest process. In order for a retest to pass, it must pass 2 retests from two different laboratories. One retest sample should be taken from the retention sample, the other should be taken from the parent lot. 11.080, 11.085: This process should be exp anded and conducted on a regular basis. Any questionable result s should be subjected to random comparative testing conducted by multiple labs. The combination of publishing all COAs and having the ability to retest any result at any time should be a signif icant deterrent to falsifying results. Thank you for reviewing our feedback and concerns. If you have any questions or need additional information, please let us know. Regards, Ace Analytical Laboratory Darryl Johnson, PhD , Scientific Director Kate Bo swell , Quality Assurance and Compliance Manager Bruce Burnett, 1Amber Virkler Cc: Karalin Cronkhite Subject: Question Hello, There was a notice sent out from a previous director of the Department of Taxation a couple years ago that said that cultivation facilities were NOT allowed to break out the Wholesale 15% excise tax on invoices sent to our customers. I do not see this mentioned in the proposed regulations. This creates an accounting nightmare plus it will make it very difficult for the state to audit cultivation facilities in the future as the tax has many categories with different amounts plus it changes every 6 months. Is there any good reason why we need to hide this tax from our customers? I strongly suggest that in an effort to improve transparency and to help with accounting that the CCB allow cultivation facilities to break out as a separate line item on invoices the 15% wholesale excise tax. Please let me know if we are now allowed to break out this tax. Thanks Nick Puliz General Manager THC Nevada, LLC Director Tyler Klimas Executive Director Cannabis Compliance Board 555 E. Washington Avenue, Suite 5100 Las Vegas, NV 89101 June 18, 2020 S u b j e c t : Comments in Response to June 18, 2020 Public Workshop Dear Director Klimas, On behalf of members of the Nevada Dispensary Association (\"NDA\"), thank you for considering previously submitted written comments and for holding a public workshop discussing relevant changes. NDA thanks the Cannabis Compliance Board (\"CCB\") for changes made in response to written comments, including the provisions to petition for a rule change, the provision to petition for a declaratory order, the ramp up period for changing the word marijuana to cannabis in packages and labels,. Based on the summary of changes provided at the June 18, 2020 public workshop, NDA believes the requests below have not been addressed. Most importantly, please clarify whether non-officers and non-board member shareholders of publicly traded companies with less than five (5) percent in shares of the company would be required to obtain an agent card under the proposed NCCR. If this requirement does apply to publicly traded companies, please consider the comments NDA, other licensees, and various attorneys with experience in this field have provided regarding this provision. Please do not require owners of privately held companies with less than five (5) percent ownership to obtain agent cards as previously discussed in written comments. This would be an impossibility for some privately held companies with large ownership groups under five (5) percent and discourages smaller investors from entering the market. Please require only annual disclosure of owners with less than five (5) percent ownership of publicly and privately held companies. Please specify timelines in which administrative approvals will be issued with regards to packaging approvals, product approvals, ingredient approvals, equipment approvals, and modification of operation approvals (for example, 30-60 days); Please remove the proposed requirement NCCR 6.085 to require a training officer to sign confirmation of training completed by a security manager as this is very difficult to obtain and there is no evidence or data indicating this will result in increased security. 521 S. 7TH STREET LAS VEGAS, NV 89101 RIANA@NVDISPENSE.COM 702.782.4180 Alternatively, please include a requirement that the CCB maintain a published list of when and where the courses outlined in the regulations are available; Please defer to the Nevada Rules of Civil Procedure where NCCR are silent; Please define diversity or provide a process in which that will be defined; Please require the Board to enter written findings when it admits evidence for which the chain of custody has failed; Please modify the proposed definition of private residence under NCCR 1.163 to prohibit deliveries to establishments that are required to pay transient occupancy tax; Please remove the provision under NCCR 4.120 that creates a rebuttable presumption that missing records, documents, and surveillance would be harmful to the licensee; Please remove the requirement to provide each individual customer with a manifest generated by the seed to sale tracking system as required under NCCR 7.050 and allow establishments to provide receipts generated by their own point of sale system. This provision is not necessary to maintain accurate records or provide customers with accurate information. This provision does not support any of the overarching goals of cannabis regulation; and Please remove the proposed additional restriction on delivery limiting orders to one (1) ounce per \"calendar day\" under NCCR 7.050(4). The current statutory requirement for cannabis purchases is one (1) ounce. There has not been a significant issue with purchase amounts so this would impose additional regulatory tracking and burdens unnecessarily. The Nevada Dispensary Association worked with a large number of licensees to coalesce concerns in order to streamline the amount of comments and communications the CCB would need to spend time reviewing and thus there is a significant amount of support for the above requests. We look forward to your thoughtful consideration of these comments and request that the CCB convene a workshop dedicated solely to transfers and agent cards for owners with less than five (5) percent interest. Thank you very much for your time and consideration. Respectfully Submitted, Riana Durrett, Esq. 521 S. "}
