The idea is to deep cleanse skin, reduce redness caused by temperature swings, and restore a natural healthy glow - three essential steps to freshen up skin. COFFEE GROUNDS FOR GENTLE EXFOLIATION Revitalising your skin requires deep cleansing, and therefore regular exfoliation to get rid of the dead cells that build up throughout the winter. Coffee grounds are the most suitable natural ingredient for this task.

Plus, it won't cost you a thing, since the grounds from your coffee maker were probably destined to be thrown out anyway. And it's a great way to recycle waste. CARROTS FOR A HEALTHY GLOW Carrots might be tasty to eat, but they also give your skin that healthy glow it so desperately needs.

In addition to its calming effect, calendula has reparative properties that allow the skin to heal more easily. Add it to your skin detox programme to step into "}
