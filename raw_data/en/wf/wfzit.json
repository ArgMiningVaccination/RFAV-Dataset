The ultimate judgment regarding any specific clinical procedure or treatment must be made by the physician in light of the circumstances presented by the patient. Otitis Media Patient population: Pediatric patients (>2 months old) and adults Objectives: (1) Limit acute symptoms and suppurative complications caused by acute otitis media . (2) Maximize language development and minimize long term damage to middle ear structure associated with otitis media with effusion. (3) Limit complications of antibiotic therapy including the development of antibiotic - resistant bacteria. Key points Diagnosis Distinguish be tween acute otitis media (AOM) and otitis media with effusion (OME) (see Table 1). Symptoms of pain or fever, together with an inflammatory middle ear effusion, are required to make a diagnosis of AOM [I, D*]. The presence of middle ear effusion should be determined by the combined use of otoscopy, pneumatic otoscopy, and tympanometry when necessary [I, D*]. Therapy of acute otitis media Recommend adequate analgesia for all children with AOM [I, D*]. Consider deferring antibiotic therapy for lower risk children with AOM [II, A*]. When antibiotic therapy is deferred, facilitate patient access to antibiotics if symptoms worsen (e.g., a \"back -up\" prescription given at visit or a convenient system for subsequent call -in) [I, C*]. Amoxicillin is the f irst choice of antibiotic therapy for all cases of AOM. - Children: - Dosing: < 4 years, 80 mg/kg/day divided BID; 4 years, 40 - 60 mg/kg/day [I, C*]. - Duration 5 -10 days: 5 days is usually sufficient at lower cost and fewer side effects, although 10 days reduces clinical failure [A*]. Consider 10- day course for children : with significant early URI symptoms and <2 years old , with possible sinusitis, and with possible strep throat [II, D*] . - Adults: either 875 mg BID x 10 days or 500 mg 2 tabs BID x 10 days [I, C*]. In the event of allergy to amoxicillin, azithromycin (Zithromax) dosed at 30 mg/kg for one dos e is the appropriate first line therapy. Treat AOM that is clinically unresponsive to amoxicillin after 72 hours of therapy with amoxicillin/clavulanate ( Augmentin ES; amoxicillin component 80 mg/kg/day days or with azithromycin (Zith romax) 20 mg/kg daily for 3 days [II, C*]. Patients with significant, persistent symptoms on high -dose amoxicillin/clavulanate (Augmentin ES) or C*]. The decision to use ceftriaxone (Rocephin) should take into account the negative impact it will have on local antibiotic resistance patterns . Therapy of OME Children with middle ear effusions should be examined at 3 month intervals for clearance of the effusion [I, D*]. Children with evidence of mucoid effusions or anatomic damage to the middle ear should be referred to otolaryngology if effusion or abnormal physical findings persist for 3 months [I, D*]. Children with apparent serous effusions should be referred to ot olaryngology if effusion persists for 6 months and there is evidence of hearing loss or language delay [I, D*]. Children with an asymptomatic middle ear effusion (no apparent developmental or behavioral problems) can be followed without referral [I, B*]. Parents of all children with OME should be informed about approaches to maximize language development in a child with a possible hearing loss [I, C*]. Decongestants and other nasal steroids have been shown not to decreas e middle ear effusions [IIIA*].

Diagnosis and Treatment of Otitis Media with Effusion Evaluate tympanic membranes at every well child and sick child exam when feasible. Perform pneumatic otoscopy or tympanometry when possible. Record findings. If the tympanic membrane (TM) is occluded with cerumen, consider removal. If MEE, determine nature of eff usion. Attempt to distinguish between effusions that are likely to be transient, such as serous or purulent effusions and effusions likely to be persistent or associated with significant morbidity, such as mucoid effusion s. For likely transient effusions, reevaluate at 3 month intervals, including a screen for language delay. In the absence of anatomic damage or evidence for developmental or behavioral complications, continue to observe at 3 month intervals. If complications appear to arise, refer to otol aryngology. For apparent mucoid effusions or effusions that appear to be associated with anatomic damage, such as adhesive otitis or retraction pockets, reevaluate in 4 -6 weeks . If abnormality persists, refer to otolaryngology. No antibiotics are indicated . Decongestants and nasal steroids are not indicated. If symptoms arise, see AOM (Table 2). Table 4. Risk factors for Developmental Difficulties Hearing loss independent of OME Suspected or diagnosed speech and language delay Autism spectrum disorder Syndromes (i.e. Down Syndrome) or craniofacial abnormalities that include cognitive, speech, or language delays Blindness or uncorrectable visual impairment Cleft palate with or without an associated syndrome Developmental delay Known or suspected exposure to environmental disorganization, lack of linguistic stimulation, or neglect Clinical Background Clinical Problem and Current Dilemma Incidence Middle ear disease is among the most common issues faced by clinicians caring for children. Approxima tely 80% of children will experience at least one episode of acute otitis media (AOM) and 80 -90% will experience at least one episode of otitis media with effusion (OME) before their third birthday. In 2006, these diagnoses were responsible for at least 8 million office visits and between 3 and 4 billion dollars in health care spending in the United States . Variability in Diagnosis and Treatment Despite the general familiarity with this common condition, a great deal of variability remains in diagnostic criteria, approaches to therapy, and follow -up. In 2004, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAP/AAFP) published a clinical practice guideline for AOM (National AOM - guideline), and the American Academy of Pedi atrics and the American Academy of Otolaryngology -Head and Neck Surgery (AAP/AAOHNS) published a guideline for the management of OME (National OME -guideline). These guidelines were intended to address this variability . The AAP published an updated guidelin e for the management of AOM in 2013. Diagnosis. The National Guidelines emphasize the distinction between AOM and OME. The diagnosis of AOM is based on the presence of symptoms (ear pain, fever) in the context of an inflamed middle ear effusion. The di agnosis of OME is the presence of a middle ear effusion in the absence of symptoms. The effusion of OME can be serous, mucoid, or purulent. Use/overuse of antibiotics. Clinicians have years of experience treating middle ear disease with antibiotics. Th e favorable natural history of these conditions and the marginal impact of antibiotic therapy on outcome are underappreciated by clinicians and by patients . Clinicians overestimate the extent to which clinical failure is due to antibiotic resistance, and overestimate the likelihood that second line medications will cover resistant organisms. Referral process. Particularly for children, o tolaryngology evaluation plays an important role in the management of recurrent AOM and persistent OME. However, the ability of the surgeon to reach the most appropriate decision for the management of a given patient may be limited by a lack of historical information including previous antibiotic therapy and an accurate time course of middle ear disease. More Conserva tive Approach Recommended In general, both of the 2004 national guidelines encourage d a more conservative approach to the care of these conditions than had been practiced previously. The 2013 AAP guideline clarified the use of this approach, incorporating the results of subsequent controlled trials of 4 UMHS Otitis Media Guideline, April 2013 placebo vs. antibiotic therapy for young children , with more stringent diagnostic criteria for AOM than had been used in prior studies . This guideline is based upon the principles of these national guidelines . Most clinical studies of AOM and OME have documented significant clinical uncertainty associated with the etiology and treatment of these conditions. Often the differences between therapies are statistically significant, but not clinically useful. Th erefore, clinical recommendations in the UM guideline reflect the \"number needed to treat\" to improve the outcome for a single child rather than the statistical significance of randomized trials. Recommendations presented here balance several factors, including speeding the resolution of short -term symptoms, preventing significant complications, reducing complications of therapy, minimizing cost and inconvenience, and maximizing patient satisfaction. Longer term and ecological considerations include the effects of middle ear disease on language development and the possible effects of antibiotic exposure on long term immunity and gut health. Ecological considerations include the effect of antibiotic prescriptions on antibiotic resistance in the community, with particular attention to penicillin resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP), methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and multiple - resistant organisms relevant to immunocompromised patients. All of these factors must be considered in the context of the considerable variability and uncertainty surrounding the diagnosis and treatment of AOM. Rationale for Recommendations Etiology of AOM Pathogens. AOM is usually a complication of eustachian tube dysfunction experienced during an acut e viral upper respiratory infection. Some viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, and human metapnemovirus, are associated with higher rates of AOM. Bacteria are isolated from middle ear fluid cultures in 50 -90% of cases of AOM catarrhalis are common organisms isolated from middle ear fluid . Haemophilus influenza and non- vaccine associated serotypes of Strep. pneumoniae have become the most prevalent organism s following the introduction of the pneumococcal heptavalent vaccine (PCV7) . A variety of bacteria, including Group A strep and Staphlococcal. aureus are isolated from approximately 10% of ears. Approximately 5% of ears have multiple pathogens. Gram negative bacilli were identified in 10.5% of infants under 6 weeks of age in one recent study. Physical exam findings are incompletely correlated with the etiology of AOM. Middle ear fluid is sterile in 25 -50% of tympanocentesis specimens s atisfying the above criteria for AOM, depending on the population examined. Furthermore, symptom scores do not distinguish bacterial from non - bacterial AOM nor among different bacterial etiologies. Persistent pathogenic bacteria can be cultured from asym ptomatic ears and from approximately 20% of ears undergoing ventilation tube (VT) placement for chronic OME. These observations underscore the difficulty in equating AOM with bacterial infection. Risk Factors for AOM Age. Age is a significant pred ictor of AOM frequency, severity, and responsiveness to treatment. Infants and toddlers are more severely affected, may take longer to respond to treatment, and can be more difficult to diagnose accurately. Consequently, clinicians should be cautious in extrapolating results from clinical trials involving older children to younger age groups. Additional risk factors. Several specific risk factors for recurrent AOM and OME have been identified or are likely: Exposure to group day care with subsequent increase in respiratory infections. Exposure to environmental smoke or other respiratory irritants and allergens that interfere with Eustachian tube function. Lack of breast feeding. Supine feeding position. Use of pacifiers by toddlers and older childre n. Family history of recurrent AOM. Craniofacial abnormalities. Immune deficiency. Gastro -esophageal reflux. Diagnosis Distinguishing AOM and OME. The distinction between AOM and OME does not refer to etiology or depend on whether pathogenic bacter ia are present in the middle ear. No \"gold standard\" exists for the diagnosis of AOM. The National AOM -guideline defines AOM as a combination of (see Table 1): 1) middle ear effusion, 2) physical evidence of middle ear inflammation, and 3) the acute (< 48 hours) onset of signs and symptoms (i.e. ear pain, irritability, fever) referable to the middle ear. Otitis media with effusion (OME) is defined as middle ear effusion (MEE) in the absence of acute symptoms. Techniques for identifying MEE. The b asic question facing a clinician evaluating a patient's ears is whether or not MEE is present. If the presence or absence of MEE is not clear, all available techniques should be used. Techniques include otoscopy, pneumatic otoscopy, and tympanometry. Pneumatic otoscopy. In the national guidelines, pneumatic otoscopy is recommended as an essential technique for the diagnosis of AOM and OME. In skilled hands with appropriate equipment this technique is 70 -90% sensitive and specific for determining the pr esence of middle ear effusion. This can be compared to 60 -70% accuracy with simple otoscopy. Pneumatic otoscopy is most helpful when cerumen is removed from the external auditory canal and the otoscopist uses equipment such as hard plastic reusable ear t ips with rounded edges rather than disposable tips. Having a well- maintained, fully -charged otoscope is also important. Pneumatic otoscopy is also helpful in identifying middle ear pathology such as retraction pockets and tympanic membrane adhesion to the ossicles even in the absence on MEE. Tympanometry/acoustic reflectometry . Tympanometry and acoustic reflectometry can be valuable adjuncts to, but not a substitute for, otoscopy and pneumatic otoscopy. Tympanometry provides an important confirmation of m iddle 5 UMHS Otitis Media Guideline, April 2013 ear fluid and is helpful for physicians honing their otoscopy skills. Tympanometry can also measure middle ear pressures and easily demonstrate the patency of myringotomy tubes by measuring increased external canal volumes. Tympanometry has a sens itivity and specificity of 70 -90% for the detection of middle ear fluid, but depends on patient cooperation. Technical factors such as cerumen and probe position can lead to artifactual flattening of the tympanogram. The presence of a \"normal\" curve does not rule out the presence of air -fluid levels and effusion in the middle ear. However, together with normal otoscopy, a normal tympanogram is predictive of the lack of middle ear fluid. A \"flat\" tympanogram should be confirmed through repeated measurements, recording appropriate external canal volumes, and through correlation with pneumatic otoscopy. Acoustic reflectometry is also an appropriate approach for evaluating the presence of middle ear fluid, but, like tympanometry, it has imperfect sensitivity and specificity and must be correlated with the clinical exam. For most clinical purposes, a tympanic membrane bulging with an apparent purulent effusion is a more useful sign of bacterial infection than isolated immobility on pneumatic otoscopy, and it is probably sufficient to make the diagnosis of AOM in association with typical symptoms . No symptoms directly co rrelate with the appearance of the tympanic membrane, so the clinician should not make the diagnosis of AOM based solely on the clinical histo ry - the tympanic membrane should be directly visualiz ed. Management of Acute Otitis Media (AOM) Management recommendations for AOM are summarized in Table 2, including antibiotic choice, dosing, and cost. These recommendations emphasize flexibility and collaboration with parents to identify a mutually satisfying approach to deal with a specific episode of middle ear disease. Usually, this plan can be reduced to two specific questions: when to start antibiotic therapy and which antibiotic to choose. B asic management recommendations are: 1) Antibiotics should be started when they are likely to significantly reduce morbidity that cannot be better reduced through the use of analgesics. 2) High dose amoxicillin is the antibiotic of choice for every episode of A OM unless compelling reasons exist for choosing a different agent. These fundamental management recommendations are based on the following principles. Risk. The risk of significant complications of middle ear disease should be minimized, including mastoiditis, meningitis, bacterial sepsis, intracranial abscess, prolonged symptoms of fever or irritability, and permanent hearing loss. These events are rare in children with AOM. Resistance. Selection of antibiotic -resistant pathogens due to antibiotic therapy should be avoided. The selection of antibiotic resistant bacteria in the community remains a major public health challenge. Impact. The impact of a course of antibiotic therapy on the outcome of an episode of AOM depends upon the age of the child and the severity of associated symptoms . Antibiotic therapy should be reserved for those situations in which it is likely to have a positive impact on outcome, i.e. situations not better treated with analgesics. Analgesics. Analgesics are recomm ended for symptoms of ear pain, fever, and irritability. Analgesics are particularly important at bed time, since disrupted sleep is one of the most common symptoms motivating parents to seek care. Ibuprofen is preferred over acetaminophen, given its lon ger duration of action and its lower toxicity in the event of overdose. Additionally it has anti- inflammatory effects which may further potentiate its analgesic effect. Topical analgesics are likely not helpful except for s hort term pain management . Observation vs. initiating antibiotic therapy. Although many children may show improvement on placebo, antibiotic therapy may be more beneficial than suggested by prior studies with less precise definitions of AOM. Two recent, randomized, placeb o-controlled trials studied the treatment of AOM in children under 3 years old. Both studies used a strict definition of AOM, requiring a bulging TM with erythema. Patients were treated with amoxicillin/ clavulanic acid. Both studies documented a significant differenc e in symptoms (fever and pain) in these young children when treated with antibiotics. In one of the studies, the rate of clinical failure at day 10 was 51% in children treated with placebo compared to 16% in children treated with antibiotics, fo r a number needed to treat of 3. The difference was more pronounced for children with bilateral AOM. A second study showed similar results. A strategy for improving the care of AOM is to identify the subset of patients least likely to benefit from antibiotic therapy and consider deferring antibiotic therapy for those patients. This category would include children: > 2 years of age with relatively minor symptoms < 2 years of age with mild symptoms and unilateral disease . Studies using observation options have shown that observation can be effective and safe, with no increases in rates of adverse outcomes, provided that good follow up occurs and access to \"rescue\" or \"just in case\" prescription therapy is provided. In most studies, about 1/3 of patients initia lly assigned to observation will request or require antibiotic treatment. However, this does not mean that the initial decision to defer antibiotics was mistaken, or even that the antibiotics were ultimately necessary. The observation option allows parents the flexibility of deciding for themselves when and if antibiotics are necessary, while substantially decreasing children's exposure to antibiotics. The rate of antibiotic therapy can be significantly reduced through the provision of adequate parental education about the natural history of AOM. Specifically, parents should be informed at the outset that on average, not all children benefit from antibiotic therapy, that approximately 10% of children receiving antibiotics will have an untoward outcome su ch as diarrhea or rash . In addition, parents need to know that at many cases of AOM are caused by viruses, not bacteria, that no oral antibiotic eliminates more than 80% of the bacteria found in cases of AOM, and that oral analgesics, such as ibuprofen, are much more likely to speed resolution of symptoms than oral antibiotics. Finally, they need to know that 10 -20% of children will continue to have symptoms no matter what therapy is given, and that apparent failure with the observation option does not mea n that antibiotics will necessarily be needed in the future. These points are summarized in the patient education materials provided with this guideline. 6 UMHS Otitis Media Guideline, April 2013 A fairly extensive empirical data base supports these expectations. In the placebo controlled tria ls, the likelihood of prolonged symptoms leading to the eventual administration of antibiotics depended largely on the severity of symptoms at diagnosis, particularly fever. Therefore excluding such patients from the observation option is likely to increas e clinician and parent confidence in this approach The most important information derived from the four published trials of the observation option is that no significant complications occurred among more than 1,700 subjects followed without initial antibio tic therapy, despite the fact that approximately 50% of subjects had fever at enrollment. Thus, clinicians should feel comfortable that deferring antibiotics, even for moderately symptomatic patients, is unlikely to lead to untoward complications. Any reduction in antibiotic usage is likely to be associated with decreased costs as well as decreased selective pressure for antibiotic resistant bacteria. Reduction in the use of first-line antibiotics would lead to a reduction in the need for second -line a gents such as amoxicillin/clavulanate or cephalosporin . The use of beta- lactamase resistant antibiotics may promote colonization with resistant organisms . \"Back -up\" options for prescriptions. In order for the observation to be acceptable for pat ients, clinicians must facilitate the subsequent access to antibiotics for patients whose symptoms worsen. One option is to provide parents with \"back -up\" prescriptions to be filled in the event of symptomatic persistence. Such prescriptions should be dated as needing to be filled within 3 -4 days of diagnosis, to prevent parents from inappropriately treating future illnesses. Alternatively, a system by which parents can call to request antibiotic prescriptions without excessive inconvenience could be established. In one study, the use of a safety net prescription system reduced the number of courses of antibiotics given by 70%. Antibiotic choice. The initial choice of antibiotic should almost always be high dose amoxicillin. The advantages of amoxicilli n include cost, tolerability, safety, and efficacy. No antibiotic has been demonstrated to be superior to amoxicillin in clinical trials involving tympanocentesis before and after therapy. Oral cephalosporins are uniformly inferior to high -dose amoxicillin for pneumococcus, especially penicillin - resistant pneumococcus. Unless the patient is allergic to amoxicillin, in which case high -dose azithromycin (Zithromax) would be the first- line agent, no empirical basis exists for choosing any oral antibiotic besides amoxicillin for the treatment of AOM. This is true even if the patient has a past history of recurrent AOM or amoxicillin failure. Clinically ill children with AOM are much more likely to have pneumococcal infections, such as occult pneumonia, than beta-lactamase producing H. influenza (about 5 -10% of all episodes of AOM) . Since the mechanism of resistance for penicillin resistant pneumococcus is due to an altered penicillin binding protein (not secondary to a beta - lactamase) and the drug of choice fo r penicillin -resistant pneumococcus is high dose penicillin, we feel that the advantages of high dose amoxicillin outweigh the theoretical advantages of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (Augmentin) . If amoxicillin/clavulanic acid is used, suspensions meant for high dose amoxicillin dosing should be used (i .e., Augmentin ES) to decrease the rate of gastrointestinal upset. Cephalosporins are only 70- 80% effective in clearing middle ear bacteria in double tympanocentesis studies of AOM. In one study of cefdinir (Omnicef) efficacy, this antibiotic only cleared pathogenic bacteria from the middle ear space in 78% of patients including only 72% of ears with H. influenza. When used we recommend a 2 nd generation cephalosporin, like cefuroxime (Ceftin), instead of generation cephalosporin , like c efdinir . Both are relatively equally effective against H. influenza and M. cateralis , but the 2 nd generation cephalosporin will not drive secondary resistances to the same extent with streptococcus pneumonia or enteric organisms. Allergy to amoxicillin. If a patient has a significant amoxicillin allergy (e.g., urticaria, or airway hyper - reactivity), the recommended antibiotic is high -dose azithromycin (Zithromax) . High dose azithromycin appears to be more effective than the commonly used 5 day course of this agent, and it appears to be clinically comparable to high dose amoxicillin in some studies. However, excessive use of azithromycin is associated with increasing rates of erythromycin resistance, particularly invo lving group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, and therefore its routine use should be discouraged. Cefuroxime (Ceftin) can also be used, although it is clinically inferior to amoxicillin . Third generation cephalosporins, such as cefdinir (Omnicef) , are not more effective and carr y with them an excessive risk of selection of resistant bacteria. The use of ceftriaxone (Rocephin) should be reserved for episodes of clinical failure (see below) or for clinical situations in which the clinician suspects a seriou s bacterial infection as co-morbidity of the AOM. Strong c onsideration should be given to obtaining appropriate laboratory studies such as blood or urine cultures before administering ceftriaxone, as well as obtain ing a white count with differential or C -reactive protein in order to confirm the severity of the illness. Follow up should be ensured, and alternative diagnoses, such as a viral illness or pneumonia , should be considered in the event of clinical failure. Although some children will likely bene fit from IM ceftriaxone, the decision to prescribe this agent should not be made lightly, since the overuse of this agent is likely to significantly increase high level penicillin resistance in the community . Ceftriaxone can be administered for up to three days, but a single dose is often sufficient. Ceftriaxone might also be appropriate in situations where antibiotics are indicated but oral antibiotics are not tolerated, such as vomiting . Bicillin CR might also be a better overall option in that situatio n. Amoxicillin dosing and duration. Given the risk of penicillin resistant pneumococcus, for children under 4 years amoxicillin should be dosed at 80 mg/kg per day divided twice a day for 5 to 10 days. Children 4 years and older can probably receive 40- 60 mg/kg/day. Since the major impact of antibiotic therapy is to reduce symptoms at 48 - 72 hours, 5 days of therapy are usually sufficient. In one randomized trial of 5 vs. 10 days of amoxicillin, the 10 day course was associated with a significantly lo wer likelihood of clinical failure. However, in this study, \"the number needed to treat\" was 10 indicating that 10 children with AOM would need to be prescribed 10 days instead of five days of therapy, to improve the outcome for one. Since it is unclear h ow many parents continue to give amoxicillin consistently once the symptoms are resolved, it is possible that the increased cost and inconvenience of giving a ten day course might not be outweighed by the improvement in symptomatic outcome at 10 days. Thi s would be particularly true in older children. Furthermore, illnesses, 7 UMHS Otitis Media Guideline, April 2013 rashes, and diarrhea occur in all children at some time, and they will be more likely to occur while on antibiotics. Thus, consider reserving the use of a ten day course of antibioti cs for children most likely to benefit, e.g. young children with significant early URI symptoms, children with possible sinusitis, and children with possible strep throats. In most other cases, one would expect the major symptoms to resolve in five days, even without treatment. If desired, a prescription could be given for ten days of amoxicillin with instructions to discontinue and discard the medication 2 -3 days after resolution of symptoms. Diarrhea and candidal infections are among the most common complications of antibiotic therapy. Therefore parents should be warned about this in advance. It is also appropriate to provide recommendations about diaper care and the application of clotrimazole (Lotrimin) cream in the event of diaper rash. Giving yogurt with active cultures might also be helpful. Probiotics . Antibiotic administration in general, as well as for the management of AOM, is frequently associated with the onset of diarrhea (occurring in up to 40% of patients). Although the diarrhea is usually self -limited, it can become more worrisome when associated with C. difficile . A Cochrane meta- analysis of 10 randomized controlled trials in children from age 1 month to 15 years demonstrated that probiotics reduced the incidence of antibiotic asso ciated diarrhea when given prior to the onset of diarrhea. Thus initiating a probiotic at the onset of antibiotic therapy can be considered in the management of AOM. Lactobacillus GG and Saccharomyces boulardii are frequently used strains , but commercial ly available preparations are not strictly regulated. Yogurt with active cultures and fermented milk are frequently used vehicles for the delivery of the desired probiotic. Persistent AOM. Children experiencing persistent, significant AOM symptoms despite at least 48 -72 hours of antibiotic therapy should be clinically reexamined to determine whether or not the persistent symptoms are associated with physical findings of AOM. In the event that a bulging, inflamed TM is observed, the child should be changed to a second line agent. For children initially on amoxicillin, high -dose amoxicillin/clavulanate is probably the best choice, although high dose azithromycin is comparable. For children with significant amoxicillin allergy (urticaria, systemic reactio ns, or erythema multiforme), who fail initially on azithromycin, cefuroxime is recommended. Oral ciprofloxacin is probably also an effective choice but is discouraged. Trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxasole is no longer an effective agent for the treatment of AO M. Recurrence of symptoms more than 2 weeks after the initial diagnosis of AOM should be assumed to be a new and unrelated episode of AOM caused by a new organism. Once again, high dose amoxicillin is the agent of choice. Also, consider the \"Observati on option\". Clinicians should discourage the belief that \"amoxicillin doesn't work\" for a particular patient. Follow up of AOM. The major rationale for the re- examination of children with AOM whose symptoms have resolved is to document the clearance of MEE. It is probably most appropriate to wait at least 3 months to perform this evaluation. In the event that MEE persists, the child should be entered into the algorithm for OME described below. Recurrent AOM. Many children with AOM go on to have recurrent episodes and end up receiving multiple courses of antibiotics. Several strategies are likely helpful for this problem. First precisely define whether or not the child is suffering from recurrent AOM. Young children are frequently seen in the office with middle ear effusions and non-specific symptoms such as chronic sleep disturbances, nasal congestion, or fussiness. These children might not have AOM or they might have AOM mild enough to follow with watchful waiting. It is possible that unnecessary ear rechecks also contribute to excessive diagnoses of AOM. For children with genuine recurrent AOM (3 or more episodes in 6 months), several strategies are likely to be helpful. Immunization with the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and annual influenza vaccination have both been shown to have a small but statistically significant impact on the frequency of AOM, although the major benefit of each of these vaccines is in the prevention of systemic disease. Reduction in exposure to passive smoke and elimi nation of bottle propping and pacifiers are probably helpful. Xylitol gum or syrup use may also be helpful. Gastroesophageal reflux also appears to contribute to AOM, and it is possible that appropriate treatment of this condition could reduce middle ear disease. In some cases, undiagnosed food allergies probably contribute to GI disturbances, chronic rhinorrhea, and eczema. The chronic nasal congestion in turn contributes to AOM. For children in day care, recurrent rhinorrhea is the norm, and parents can be reassured that it will eventually resolve, particularly with the onset of summer. Particularly in infants evidence is growing that probiotics may reduce the incidence of infections , including otitis media , during the first year of life. While the ev idence is not sufficient to support this practice, no detrimental effects have been described so the practic e need not be discouraged . In the event that recurrent AOM leads to intolerable symptoms, or is associated with significant complications or multip le, clinically significant antibiotic sensitivities, ventilation tube placement is a good option. In most cases, however, AOM is a benign, easily treatable condition that responds well to a combination of amoxicillin and analgesics. Furthermore, recurrent AOM has a favorable natural history, and in the only RCT of tympanostomy tubes vs. watchful waiting, tubes reduced the incidence of AOM and/or otorrhea by only one episode per year. On a positive note, ventilation tubes will turn what would otherwise be a n episode of AOM into an episode of purulent ear drainage. Such drainage is likely to be less painful than the comparable episode of AOM and is effectively treated with ear irrigation (\"otic toilet\") and fluoroquinolone drops. Unfortunately, placement of ventilation tubes is also associated with an increased risk of long -term tympanic membrane abnormalities and reduced hearing compared to medical therapy. Thus, it is reasonable to reserve ventilation tube placement for those children with a more problema tic clinical history. Although it is tempting to place children on long term antibiotic therapy for the prophylaxis of recurrent AOM, long term therapy is not recommended in this era of increasing antibiotic resistance. Management of Otitis Media with E ffusion (OME) The d iagnosis and treatment of OME are summarized in Table 3. Decongestants and nasal steroids are not recommended 8 UMHS Otitis Media Guideline, April 2013 because multiple studies have shown them to be ineffective in hastening the clearance of middle ear fluid. Approximately 80- 90% of children will have at least one episode of OME by age 3 and 10- 20% of well children will have OME detected at any given time. The significance of this observation is unclear, since most cases (80 -90%) will resolve spontaneously in 3 -4 months. The two major complications of OME are: 1) a transient hearing loss, potentially associated with language development or behavioral problems, and 2) chronic anatomic injury to the tympanic membrane leading to the need for reconstructive surgery. The lik elihood of either of these outcomes depends on the persistence of the middle ear effusion and its association with chronic, negative middle ear pressures. In order to address these complications of OME, it is worthwhile to distinguish between (a) transie nt serous or purulent effusions with neutral or positive pressure and (b) chronic mucoid effusions with negative pressure and anatomic changes to the TM. In the absence of a significant hearing loss, evidence of damage to middle ear structures, or risk factors for poor outcome (see Table 4), we recommend clinical reevaluation for all children with OME at 3 month intervals until the effusion is cleared or complications are identified. Screening for speech delays should be undertaken at all regular well visits as well as at these clinical reevaluation s. If developmental delay becomes apparent, the child should be referred to otolaryngology. In the event that the effusion appears mucoid or the tympanic membrane exhibits tympanic membrane adhesion to ossicles, or apparent cholesteatoma, the child should be revaluated in 4 to 6 weeks to confirm the findings and then be referred to otolaryngology. Ideally, the routine use of pneumatic otoscopy will increase the rate of identification of such anatomic abnormalities even in the absence of MEE, particularly in children with benign abnormalities of the tympanic membrane such as tympanosclerosis. Although it is often possible to rule out significant language delay u sing a routine screen for developmental milestones (such as the Ages and Stages screening tools) , a referral to Early On (1 -800-EARLY -ON) for a formal developmental evaluation is frequently appropriate. Early On is a state program mandated to provide deve lopmental testing for children at risk of developmental delays. Such an evaluation would also provide parents with guidance in maximizing their child's development. This is particularly important since socioeconomic factors appear to have a substantial im pact on language development and probably have more of an effect than the presence of OME with hearing loss. In many cases educational interventions may be as effective as surgical interventions. Interventions might include educating parents about effecti ve strategies for optimizing the listening -learning environment for children with OME and hearing loss and providing appropriate books for parent/child reading (e.g., Reach Out and Read, which is a program providing books to the parents of young children at all well child visits). Communication between Primary Care and Specialty Clinicians Optimal outcomes depend on communication between primary care and specialty clinicians. This communication could include a comprehensive timeline of middle ear disease, apparent resolution of MEE, and the use of antibiotic therapy and its subsequent complications. At a minimum, primary care clinicians should clearly indicate their reasons for referring the patient and their own clinical judgment about appropriate the rapy. The specialist can then make a definitive decision about care that takes into account the perspectives of the individual primary care clinician. Such communication would likely increase trust between the otolaryngologist and the primary care clinician, decrease mixed messages heard by parents, and increase the confidence with which referrals are made. Special Circumstances Special Populations Otitis media in infants 0 -8 weeks old. The preceding guidelines specifically exclude the treatment of AOM in young infants. This population is at increased risk of a severe or atypical outcome from suppurative AOM. Middle ear pathogens found in young infants include the usual bacteria found in acute otitis media as well as Group B strep, gram negative en teric bacteria, and Chlamydia trachomatis. Febrile young neonates (<2 week old) with apparent AOM should undergo a full sepsis work up as would be otherwise indicated. Initiation of empiric amoxicillin is probably acceptable for infants over 2 weeks of age with URI and AOM who are otherwise well. Otitis media in adults. Very little information has been published to guide recommendations for the management of middle ear disease in adults. In general one would expect that the principles discussed above w ould be expected to apply to the average patient with a long history of middle ear disease. However, the new onset of persistent middle ear disease in this population justifies a more thorough evaluation, specifically to rule out the possibility of a more serious underlying condition such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Isolated AOM or transient OME may be due to a recent viral URI or superimposed Eustachian tube dysfunction. Patients with these conditions should be reevaluated at six weeks for resolution. Tympanometry or audiometry may be considered as part of this evaluation. All adults with recurrent or persistent AOM or OME should probably be referred to otolaryngology for further evaluation, especially those without a lifelong history of middle ear disease. This includes adults with symptoms lasting more than six weeks, two or more episodes in a year, or persistent hearing loss. Special Situations Primary care follow -up and management of tympanostomy tubes. Be familiar with the preferences of the surgeon to whom you refer patients, since he/she will likely be handling any complications of tube placement. Recommendations of the Division of Pediatric Otolaryngology at the University of Michigan Medical Center are summarized below. 9 UMHS Otitis Media Guideline, April 2013 Post-op irri gation. After the tubes are placed in the operating room, antibiotic ear drops are placed in both ears to irrigate the tubes. The parent is given the bottle to administer the drops for the next 2 to 3 days. Ear drainage. Ear drops combining a fluoroquino lone with a corticosteroid (i .e. Ciprodex) are the safest and most effective therapy for the draining ear. Thi s includes ears draining through either a perforated ear drum or a patent tympanostomy tube. To be maximally effective, ensure that the drops can get to the site of infection. For this reason, clear the ear of purulent material prior to administration of antibiotic drops and introduce the antibiotic drops into the middle ear by pumping on the external ear canal with the tragus. Purulent debris ca n be easily cleared by warm water irrigation using 10 cc syringe topped with the luer from a cut off butterfly needle. The canal can then be dried using cotton or soft tissue paper. In the presence of tympanic membrane perforations or ventilation tubes, do NOT use a minoglycoside containing ear drops since they are ototoxic. Do NOT use alcohol containing ear drops. An alternative would be to use a wash of white vinegar and water mixed 1:1. Patients with significant systemic symptoms, such as fever, might benefit from systemic antibiotics. Management of tympanostomy tubes. Most otolaryngologists no longer advise their patients to use ear plugs with swimming, bathing, or washing hair. In most cases the physical characteristics of the ventilation tub es prevent the entry of liquids into the middle ear space unless the child dives into deep water or pumps the liquid into the middle ear. In the event of subsequent otorrhea, infusion of fluoroquinolone drops is usually the only therapy necessary. Patie nts with tubes should follow up with otolaryngology every six months and should be referred back to otolaryngology in the event of suspicion for ongoing middle ear disease. Tubes should be removed if they remain in place longer than 3 years. Cerumen remo val. The clinical justification for the removal of cerumen from asymptomatic patients is uncertain. Although this procedure has the potential to improve the visualization of the tympanic membrane, it also has the potential to cause significant morbidity, particularly pain, bleeding, and fear. The decision to remove cerumen should depend on the skill of the practitioner, the nature of the cerumen impaction, and the likely impact that examining the tympanic membrane will have on making therapeutic decision s. If clinically indicated, the occasional diagnosis and treatment of AOM is appropriate even in the absence of full tympanic membrane visualization. A flexible approach is likely to result in an improved benefit/harm ratio. Tympanometry can sometimes d emonstrate the clearance of MEE without the full visualization of the tympanic membrane. In the event of hard packed cerumen, repeated irrigation with a warm mixture of hydrogen peroxide and warm tap water has the potential to loosen or remove the cerumen . Cerumenolytic drops such as carbamide peroxide (Debrox) or docusate sodium (Colace) can be helpful in softening the cerumen prior to removal. Proper restraint will also assist in atraumatic cerumen removal. In the absence of ear pain or apparent heari ng loss, removal of cerumen does not provide additional; benefit to the patient and is not necessary. Children with cerumen impaction and tympanostomy tubes should be referred to otolaryngology for further management. It is also reasonable to refer young children with cerumen impactions to otolaryngology, since removal of such impactions is probably facilitated by access to an operating microscope and suction. Such children should have cerumenolytic drops instilled into the ears to soften the wax prior t o the clinical encounter. Ear candling, or auricular coning, is an \" alternative medical procedure \" that involves placing a cone shaped device in the ear and lighting it on fire, supposedly generating a vacuum to draw out wax. This practice is both inef fective and dangerous and can result in significant damage to the tympanic membrane and should be avoided. Acute otitis externa (AOE). AOE is diagnosed by pushing on the tragus anterior to the external ear canal. If this procedure provokes severe pain, the diagnosis of AOE is likely. Although this diagnosis can generally be made on history alone, a clinical evaluation is usually indicated, since similar symptoms might be associated with aggressive disease. It is possible that the external auditory cana l is so obstructed with purulence or debris that it is impossible to infuse antibiotic drops. In such a situation, the ear canal should be gently irrigated prior to infusion of antibiotic drops. Occasionally the walls of the canal are so swollen, that it might be necessary to place a wick, and an urgent referral to otolaryngology might be indicated. The most recent literature review of AOE indicates that there is little clinical difference between the efficacy of topical antiseptics and that of topical a ntibiotics. Therefore, the instillation of dilute vinegar is probably sufficient in most cases. Persistent cases can be treated with a topical fluoroquinolone combined with a corticosteroid. Fluoroquinolone containing drops are also indicated in the event of a possible TM perforation. Analgesia, such as ibuprofen is always indicated for children with otitis externa. Given the severe pain sometimes associated with this condition, more potent pain medications such as codeine might be indicated. Bullous m yringitis . This is the development of blisters on the tympanic membrane in the context of AOM. The lesions can be singular or multiple and are generally associated with more severe symptoms of pain and fever. Bullous myringitis is noted with 1 -16% of AOM episodes and has a slightly higher association with AOM in older children (>2 years old) and with recurrent AOM. A common misapprehension is that bullous myringitis is associated with Mycoplasma peneumoniae infection. In fact, several studies have demons trated that bullous myringitis is seen in infections with the usual spectrum of bacterial pathogens - H. influenzae, S. peneumoniae , and Moraxella catarrhalis . Because of the more severe symptoms, it is reasonable to be more proactive in analgesia managements. These patients would not be good candidates for \"watch and wait\" antibiotic prescriptions and are likely to benefit from initial treatment with amoxicillin clavulanic acid . Spontaneous ear drum perforation . This perforation occurs in approximately 6% of cases of AOM. In most cases it results in symptomatic relief of pressure from the middle ear. The resulting otorrhea however, can be disturbing to patients and their parents. As discussed above, ear drops containing fluoroquinolon es (Ciprodex) can b e an effective treatment in this situation. 10 UMHS Otitis Media Guideline, April 2013 In most cases, these ruptures will resolve spontaneously. Patients should be seen in follow up after 6 weeks to document healing. Referral to otolaryngology should occur if the perforation has not resolved in 12 months. Patients can be allowed to swim with a perforated ear drum, but should be advised not to dive deeply. Mastoiditis. Because mastoiditis can be a complication of AOM, some have raised concerns that the incidence of acute mastoiditis would incr ease with decreasing use of antibiotics. In a recent study looking at mastoiditis rates before and after the publications of the national AOM guidelines, no change in the rates of mastoiditis was identified. Strategy for Evidence Search The guideline team had accesses to the literature searches performed for the initial version of this guideline (1997) and its updates (2002, 2006). For this update the literature search began with a review updated AHRQ Evidence Report on Management of Acute Otitis Medi a, which included a systematic review of literature through July 2010 (see annotated references). To supplement these searches with more recent findings, the team then conducted a prospective search of literature published on Medline from 7/1/10 to 9/30/12 (unless otherwise noted) using the major keywords of: human, English language, guidelines, controlled trials, and cohort studies. Eleven specific searches were performed using the following terms. Detailed search terms and strategy available upon request . (1) Otitis media with effusion or serous effusion: audiogiogram or oto acustic emissions, diagnosis, treatment (since 6/1/06). (2) Recurrent otitis media, recurrent acute OM, or chronic or persistent OM: diagnosis, treatment. (3) Acute otitis media since (not recurrent, persistent, or chronic [addressed in #2]): etiology and natural history, diagnosis (signs and symptoms, hearing loss, delayed language development, otoscopy, pneumatic otoscopy, tympanometry, ent 1/1/2001), other (4) Otitis media: infants 0 -4 weeks (since 1/1/2001), diagnosis, treatment. (5) Otitis media: adults (since 1/1/2001), diagnosis, treatment. (6) Otitis media and mastoiditis. (7) Otitis media and screening for sp eech delay. (8) Otitis media not in #1 -#7: diagnosis, treatment. (9) Cerumen impaction: treatment (since 6/1/06). (10) Otorrhea: treatment. (11) Probiotic bacteria after antibiotics (since 6/1/06). The search was conducted in components each keyed to a specific causal link in a formal problem structure (available upon request). The search was supplemented with recent clinical trials known to expert members of the panel , including subsequent minor revisions in 2014 based on evidence reported in the 2013 American Academy of Pediatrics guideline on the diagnosis and management of otitis media and other more recent clinical trials . Negative trials were specifically sought. The search was a single cycle. Conclusions were based on prospective randomized controlled trials if available, to the exclusion of other data; if RCTs were not available, observational studies were admitted to consideration. If no such data were available for a given link in the problem formulation, expert opinion was used to esti mate effect size. Expert consensus was used to formulate recommendations based on the available evidence. Related National Guidelines This guideline generally conforms to: Management of Acute Otitis Media: Update.
