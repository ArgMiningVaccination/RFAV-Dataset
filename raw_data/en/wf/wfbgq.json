But how do they actually work, and which type is right for you? To answer those questions, start with our list of the best hair growth vitamins in 2023. What Are Hair Growth Vitamins? Hair growth vitamins are supplements that are formulated with ingredients recognized to support hair growth. Many brands that sell these products swear by the vitamins' ability to stimulate hair growth and make hair shinier, stronger and thicker. While some studies have proven the efficacy of certain vitamins for hair growth, many of the supplements available on the market have not been evaluated by the FDA or are not endorsed by medical professionals. The anecdotal evidence is strong, however. Who Are Hair Growth Vitamins For? Because hair growth vitamins typically contain micronutrients that you should get enough of if you eat a healthy, well-balanced diet, these vitamins are best for those who have nutrient deficiencies. You can speak with your doctor to find out about testing your vitamin levels. These supplements are considered safe, but be aware that if your diet contains enough of these nutrients already, taking hair growth vitamins can mean accumulating excess amounts of essential nutrients. Do Hair Growth Vitamins Actually Work? There are so many factors that go into hair loss and hair growth that it can be hard to say for sure whether hair growth vitamins will help you achieve the soft, voluminous hair you've always wanted. The good thing is that hair growth vitamins are generally safe, and many users claim they've reaped all kinds of benefits from taking them. Just make sure to check in with your doctor when you add a new supplement to your regimen. What to Look for in Hair Growth Vitamins Here are some common ingredients in hair growth vitamins that have been shown to provide benefits: - Biotin - Keratin - Vitamin A - Vitamin B12 - Vitamin C - Vitamin D - Vitamin E - Iron - Selenium - Zinc Deficiencies in these vitamins and minerals have been connected to hair loss, so the idea is that by replenishing them in your system you'll grow healthier hair. 1. [Blu Atlas Hair & Skin Gummies](https://bluatlas.com/products/hair-and-skin-gummies?utm_source=Dallas+News&utm_campaign=The-13-Best-Hair-Growth-Vitamins-in-2023) What's in Them: The star ingredient in this Blu Atlas product, which we feel is the best hair growth vitamin, is saw palmetto. This fruit extract can help decrease levels of DHT, a hormone produced in the scalp that can cause hair follicles to shrink and close, leading to hair loss. You'll also find folic acid to boost red blood cell production, which can in turn boost hair growth and increase volume and luster while cutting down on gray hair. There is also a blend of vitamins to nourish hair and skin, along with zinc to repair hair and stimulate keratin production; biotin, which also helps with keratin production; and iodine, which is important for follicle regeneration. What Users Say: [These hair growth vitamins](https://bluatlas.com/products/hair-and-skin-gummies?utm_source=Dallas+News&utm_campaign=The-13-Best-Hair-Growth-Vitamins-in-2023) are all the rage, with users raving about the unique mango flavor and overall taste of these satisfyingly chewy gummies that support healthy hair. Who They're Best For: Anyone who doesn't already take a daily vitamin who is looking to tackle hair growth from all angles. These hair growth gummies are also ideal for those who prefer to chew on a tasty treat rather than swallowing a capsule. About the Brand: Blu Atlas, a fairly recent arrival on the men's skincare scene, quickly created a name for itself thanks to clean formulas made with premium ingredients. They have a line of outstanding skincare and haircare products, along with Blu Atlas Atlantis, their flagship fragrance. See what the buzz is all about and give Blu Atlas Hair & Skin Gummies a try! 2. Nutrafol Hair Wellness Supplement What's in Them: Nutrafol offers hair growth nutraceutical supplements both for men and women. In the women's formula, you'll find the typical vitamins and minerals everyone needs for healthy hair, along with biotin to promote keratin production, collagen for amino acids to help form hair, ashwagandha to increase hormone DHEA production for hair growth, horsetail to boost circulation and other ingredients that target the main causes of hair issues. The men's formula is similar, but designed with men specifically in mind, targeting hormones, stress, lifestyle, metabolism, nutrition and aging to promote a healthy head of hair. What Users Say: Check out the before-and-after shots of users' scalps to get all the proof you need that these hair growth vitamins are the real deal.

Who They're Best For: People hoping for an all-natural solution to hair thinning should opt for Nutrafol, especially if they're willing to use it instead of a multivitamin. If you eat a diet low in biotin (which is found in items like organ meat, eggs, fish, meat, and seeds) this may be an optimal choice, as it contains 3000 mcg of the vitamin--plenty to get you back on track! About the Brand: Nutrafol is made up of a team of scientists and doctors who worked together to develop their hair growth supplements. The three co-founders experienced thinning hair themselves, and decided to take matters into their own hands to find a solution that could empower not just them, but also thousands of others. 3.

These include amla extract, which is touted for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties; horsetail, which detoxifies and increases blood flow; and silica, which strengthens hair and prevents thinning.

FoliGrowth Ultimate Hair Nutraceutical What's in Them: Advanced Trichology, the brand behind FoliGrowth, was the first brand recognized by the American Hair Loss Association, so you can trust their formula to be one of the best hair growth vitamins out there. The blend contains all of the classic hair growth nutrients like biotin, iodine, vitamin C and iron, with a few important additions. Like fo-ti, an herb that supports your hair and liver; PABA, an acid that strengthens hair and nails; and pine bark extract for its anti-aging properties and scalp health boost.

About the Brand: Advanced Trichology was founded by William Gaunitz, a certified trichologist with two decades of experience who dealt with hair loss himself as a teen. Gaunitz's method is trifold: first he aims to understand the cause of hair loss, then address those causes, and finally promote hair growth separate from addressing hair loss. This is the method behind Advanced Trichology, which dozens of users swear by. 6. Prose Custom Root Source What's in Them: These supplements from Prose are customized, so your formula will be slightly different from anyone else's. That being said, there are a few constants thanks to the brand's proprietary complex, which contains natural ingredients like coriander seed oil for scalp health, and millet, a grain that is a great source of omega-6 and miliacin for hair growth. (Gluten is extracted from the grain, so the formula remains gluten-free.) After you've answered a quiz about your health and personal needs, the rest of the formula will be tailored to your needs with other natural additives. You also get two separate capsules to take. The first works toward scalp health and the second supports faster hair growth and addresses hair loss. What Users Say: Users claim that these supplements work well and don't cause any negative side effects, although some say that having to take two different capsules is inconvenient. Who They're Best For: Since these vitamins are tailored to each individual, they're best for anyone!

Nature's Bounty Hair, Skin and Nails Gummies What's in Them: Nature's Bounty offers several versions of their wildly popular Hair, Skin & Nails gummies, but our favorite is the formula that contains collagen and biotin.

What Users Say: Most reviews praise the delicious flavor of the gummies, which makes them easy to incorporate into a daily routine. Many users claim they've seen numerous benefits, especially in their fingernails. Who They're Best For: Anyone who is low on collagen. Foods like bone broth are especially rich in collagen, but in order for the body to produce collagen on its own, you also need to eat foods high in zinc and vitamin C.

About the Brand: You probably recognize Nature's Bounty as the top grocery store supplement brand.

Moon Juice Super Hair What's in Them: Stress and nutrient deficiencies are often the culprits behind hair loss, and Moon Juice addresses both of these issues in this formula. A potent combination of vitamins and minerals tackles any deficiencies that might be contributing to your hair woes, while natural ingredients like ashwagandha and pumpkin seed powder fight stress and support high-quality sleep.

They provide holistic hair care that relies on plant-based ingredients for real and long-term benefits. 11. Grande Gummies Vegan Collagen Booster What's in Them: Collagen is a protein that the body naturally produces. It's found in skin, connective tissue, bone and cartilage.

Hair Growth Vitamin FAQs Can You Take These Vitamins and Daily Vitamins? You'll want to consult with your doctor when it comes to changing up your supplement regimen, but generally speaking, these hair growth vitamins deliver high enough doses of important vitamins and minerals that you can take them instead of daily vitamins. A well-balanced diet should give you all the nutrients you need, so you'll definitely want your doctor's input to ensure that you won't be overdoing it with vitamins! Will These Make the Hair All Over Your Body Grow? All this talk about growing thicker, stronger hair probably has you wondering if you'll need to start shaving more frequently after starting a hair growth vitamin regimen. The good news is, you don't have to worry about that! Since changes in body hair are typically caused by hormones, not vitamins, and since these supplements do not contain hormones, rest assured that only the hair on your head will showcase major results. How Do You Know if the Gummies Are Working? Unfortunately, all good things take time, including hair growth. While you very well may notice a difference in your skin and nails right away, the first sign that hair growth gummies are working is increased hair length. Since the hair coming out of your head is already dead upon arrival, you likely won't notice any changes in thickness until a growth cycle has passed. A little patience is required with these products--often you'll start to notice a difference within a month or so. "}
