Vaccination hesitancy ? Refers to delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite availability of vaccine services. Is complex and context specific varying across time, place and vaccines . Is influenced by factors such as complacency, convenience and confidence. Diagnosing the determinants of vaccine hesitancy in specific subgroups: The Guide to Tailoring Immunization Programmes (TIP), Butler and MacDonald, Journal of Vaccine, 2015. Vaccine Hesitancy Model Confidence Convenience Complacency When a decision-maker anticipates a feeling of more responsibility , guilt or regret if a negative outcome were to result from their doing something ('commission') than not doing something ('omission'). They still cannot say categorically that the vaccine is safe and until, however small the doubt in my mind is, I feel probably it is safe, but I can't live with that and until someone can categorically say it's going to be all right, it's not going to be acceptable to me.

Caregiver beliefs, attitudes and heuristics, related to the well - being of their children, medical care, vaccines and VPD. May correspond with the moment when caregivers' decision to vaccinate a child and the act itself overlap.

Analysis of Vaccination Behaviours Caregiver concerns are not always addressed.Environmental Factors Opportunity Social/Community Factors SupportIndividual Factors Motivation Vaccines are consistently availableHigh compliance in child vaccination, vaccination is mandatory and tied to Family Benefits for Children Mistrust of government institutions in Bulgaria, and among vulnerable communities (Sliven) in particular Misunderstanding of what the vaccine protects against By law, free medical care and vaccination for registered children < 18 years High number of \"Don't Knows\" indicate a lack of general understanding of vaccination Caregivers who don't believe VPDs cause harm, also believe children are unlikely to get VPD if they are healthy, and less likely to vaccinate Families can choose their GP, the primary medical provider Caregivers rely heavily on GP for vaccination reminders (89% of cases) Who are the caregivers to target ? Analysis of Vaccination Behaviours Among caregivers, 5 types of behaviours... 1. The late child Caregivers demonstrate positive vaccination and health behaviours , high degree of trust in GPs. However delays or missed vaccinations are possible owing to poor health, perceived or real contraindications, or lack of recall. Attention to vaccination may decrease after GP certificate is issued at 12 months. 2. The mobile child Children who belong to migrant families, for seasonal or longer - term duration. Omission of vaccination linked to lack of registration. 3. The invisible child This child remains invisible to social and health institutions, may be due to migration. 4. The wary caregiver High levels of mistrust, negative attitudes towards institutions, possibly inaccurate vaccination beliefs. 5. The poor child Poor, unemployed families for whom transport costs will prevent access to routine GP visits. Painting a Portrait Turkish is Seema's first language. She speaks Bulgarian, but does not read or write well. Her home is small, and busy, and the children are often sick. Seema is often tired. Yet, this is the way life has always been: she feels comfortable inside the settlement, and fears discrimination of outsiders, including the local GP . Her mother -in-law guides her on how to raise her children, and makes most decisions regarding her and their health. She knows that when her children get married, she will do the same for them. Her children have received some vaccinations. She is not sure of which ones... This is Seema , from Sofia, Bulgaria . A 19 year old woman of Turkish ethnicity. A mother of 2 children: a 3 year old girl and a 1 year old boy. She lives in a \"ghetto\", in the outskirts of Sofia, with her parents - in-law, husband, and his brothers' families. All of the children play together outside. They are raised as part of the same family.

Analysis of Vaccination Practices Free child care and mandatory vaccination Availability of vaccines, quality may be questioned Shortage of GPs despite high demand for services from the community Some GPs benefit from assistance from health mediators and nurses Lack of individualized reporting system prevents tracking of children who emmigrate Competing priorities within a GPs medical practice with vaccinationEnvironmental Factors Vaccination is perceived as important, fueled by memories of measles outbreaks Lack of recognition and compensation system for GPs who conduct outreach High demand for and trust in GP services in the community High responsibility of GP to \"manage\" health and vaccination of the community Strong requirement for interpersonal communications for vaccination reminders Social and Community Factors Perceived high threat and severity of VPD Vaccination is accepted as a necessary practice to protect children High workload leaves little time for each caregiver and child at the time of vaccination Perceived low health culture of community leads to mistrust and assumptions regarding information needs Weak ability to communicate in such a way to ensure parental comprehension Some GPs are very active in reaching out to the community: reminders are effective Poor health of child may lead to GP decision to not vaccination: some GPs delegate the decision to the parent: the mother knows betterIndividual Factors BULGARIA What do caregivers want at the time of the vaccination visit?
