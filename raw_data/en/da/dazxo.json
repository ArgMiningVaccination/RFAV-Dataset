Introduction The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)\u2014a group of medical methods, practices, and products not considered to be part of conventional medicine\u2014 has become popular during the last few decades.1-3Previous surveys on the frequency of CAM use by children suffering from chronic illnesses have revealed values between 46% and 70%.4-7Surveys on pediatric emergency departments in the United States and Canada showed that 12%-15% of the parents were treating their child with CAM.8-10A recent survey performed in Germany with parents of pediatriconcology patients revealed that approximately 35% of these were using CAM.11 CAM is often used in Switzerland.12-15A survey published in 2002 described that 30% of the Swiss people did use some form of CAM: 12% had used homeopathy, 11% had used Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) or acupuncture, 5% medicine (phytotherapy), 2% anthroposophic medi- cine, and 1% neuraltherapy.16The use of CAM in Switzerland, its efcacy, appropriateness, and cost-effectiveness have been evaluated within the frames of a federal program (Com- plementary Medicine Evaluation Program, PEK), which re- vealed that CAM was associated with a higher patient 1Department of Pediatric Oncology and Haematology, University Children's Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany. 2University Children's Hospital of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland. 3Research Department, Paracelsus Hospital Richterswil, Richterswil, Switzerland.

A previous study performed at the intensive care unit of the Children's Hospital of Zurich revealed that 18% of the parents of critically ill pediatric patients applied some form of CAM.21 In a previous report about the present survey, which was performed at the emergency department of the same hospital, 58% of all respondents (665 of 1143) stated that their child was using =had used some form of CAM therapies.22 The aim of the present work was to reveal the experiences that adults\u2014mainly parents\u2014accompanying pediatric pa- tients presenting to a pediatric, urban, tertiary emergency department were =are having while treating their child with CAM. The questionnaires used included items on (1) perceived effectiveness, (2) side-effects, (3) patients' compliance, (4) frequency of use, (5) costs, (6) reimbursement by health in- surance, and (7) description of the CAM therapies used. Although the survey mainly addresses the experiences with CAM, in some cases and for comparison reasons, the re- spondents were asked to describe their experiences with CM as well. Subjects and Methods The present work is an analytical cross-sectional survey of the adults\u2014mainly parents\u2014accompanying the children presenting to the pediatric emergency department of the University Children's Hospital of Zurich between October 2006 and March 2007. The study was approved and con- ducted in accordance with the ethical standards set by the Hospital Ethical Review Board. Questionnaires were offered by the ward clerk to parents (or other caretakers) while these individuals were registering the child. Caretakers were asked to ll out the questionnaire, sign the consent form, and hand it back to the ward clerk, the nurse, or the front desk before leaving the department. German, English, French, and Italian versions of the patient information sheet, consent form, and questionnaire were available. The questionnaire included 34 multiple-choice questions, addressed the situation of pediatric patients, and was completely anonymous.22Exclusion criteria were (1) previously lled-out questionnaire; (2) inability of the respondent to read or write German, English, French, or Italian; (3) respondent was accompanying resuscitation = emergency patients; (4) lack of respondent (i.e., pediatric pa- tient unaccompanied by a parent or another caretaker); and (5) respondent was accompanying a patient with emotional issues such as child abuse or psychiatric problems. All other accompanying persons were eligible for the study. A questionnaire comprising 34 multiple-choice questions was used in which homeopathy, herbal medicine, anthro- posophic medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine (including acupuncture), and Ayurveda were specied. A pilot ques- tionnaire, distributed to 20 families, was conducted to ensure the readability and clarity of the questions. Thereafter, minor revisions of the questionnaire\u2014mainly involving its layout\u2014 were made. Patients' and respondents' demographic char- acteristics as well as behavior toward vaccination of CAM users and nonusers have been published elsewhere.22,23 Questionnaires returned with fewer than 50% of the questions answered or with no answers to the specic ques- tions were excluded from the analysis. The remaining surveyresults were entered into a computerized database using Re- mark Ofce OMR 6.0.4 (Gravic Inc., Malvern PA). Data entry was performed using a Microsoft Excel database, and all data were analyzed using SPSS for Windows version 14 (SPSS Inc., Chicago IL). The data on ordinal multiple-choice answer to some questions have been converted to t in a range from 0 to 1 and averaged, in order to obtain values representative of either CAM or CM. Pearson's w2and Mann-Whitney Utests (always two-sided) were used to determine statistically sig- nicant differences between the representative values of CAM and CM, with a p-value of less than 0.05 considered to be statistically signicant. Throughout the article, quotation marks are used to refer to the original text of the questionnaire (English version). Results Demographic characteristics of the respondents Between October 2006 and March 2007, 1143 question- naires (71% of those distributed) were available for analysis, 95% of which were in German. Fifteen (15; 0.9% of those distributed) returned questionnaires were not entered into the database as fewer than 50% of the questions were an- swered. Questionnaires were lled out by patients' The sociodemographic characteristics of the respondents\u2014 including a comparison between the characteristics of CAM- users and nonusers\u2014have been previously published in detail.22In brief, the children corresponding to the respon- dents were 5.6 years old, the mothers were 34.7 years old, and the fathers were 37.4 years old. Fifty-ve percent (55%) of the children were boys, 89% of all children lived in intact families, and 92% were born in Switzerland. Fifty-four per- cent (54%) and 45% of the respondents reported that the father and the mother, respectively, had a high school edu- cation. Effectiveness and tolerability of CAM- and CM therapies How often CAM therapies ''did have an effect'' was de- scribed n\u00bc33); parallel, how often CM therapies ''did have an effect'' was answered n\u00bc14) of the respondents. When these results were translated in a 0-to-1 scale (range: ''never''\u00bc0 to ''always'' \u00bc1; see Fig. 1), the mean values for CAM and CM were 0.76 and 0.85 ( p<0.001) (i.e., the re- spondents rated the perceived effectiveness of CAM therapies to be statistically signicantly lower than that of CM thera- pies). When asked to judge CAM therapies in comparison with CM, approximately half of the respondents (49%, n\u00bc370) reported CAM therapies to be ''more effective in certain cases =against certain disorders,'' ( n\u00bc26) respondents stated that CAM therapies are ''not effective.'' Noticed side-effects of CAM therapies were described as 1.4% side effects.''474 ZUZAK ET AL.The side-effects of CM therapies were reported to be ''strong'' \u00bc0 to ''strong side- effects''\u00bc1) of 0.05 and that of CM was signi- cantly and markedly higher, namely, 0.22 ( p<0.001, Fig. 1). Frequency of use of and compliance to CAM- and CM therapies Frequency of use of CAM therapies was specied as ''every day'' by 8% of 17% ( n\u00bc116). On the other hand, the frequency of use of CM therapies was described as ''every day'' by to ''every day'' 0.31 ( p<0.001), respectively, showing a signicantly higher use of CAM than of CM (Fig. 1). To compare the compliance toward CAM and CM, the questionnaires included an item on whether the child did ''really get =take the prescribed therapies.'' Concerning CAM therapies, 8% \u00bc1) of CAM was 0.78 and of CM was 0.86 ( p<0.001), indicating a signicantly higher compliance toward CM (Fig. 1). Costs of CAM and CM The respondents were asked to estimate the annual direct costs of CAM and CM concerning the respective child, ''without counting the contributions paid by their health in- surance and without insurance premiums.'' The direct costs of CAM therapies were ''1-100 SFr'' (Swiss Francs, SFr \u00bc1.50 CM than 1000 SFr''\u00bc1) for CAM and CM were 0.15 and 0.20, respectively. Although the difference was not statistically signicant (p\u00bc0.289), there was a tendency for slightly higher costs in the case of CM- than in the case of CAM therapies (Fig. 1). The questionnaires included an item on whether ''the child's health insurance pay[s] for complementary therapies.'' Thirty-six percent (36%, n\u00bc373) of all respondents believed that nearly all costs of CAM therapies would be covered by their insurance, 22% ( n\u00bc232) knew that at least a part of the CAM therapies were balanced, 5.7% ( n\u00bc59) described that no CAM therapies were balanced by their insurance, and 36% (n\u00bc375) did not know. Sixty-ve percent (65%, n\u00bc412) of all CAM users had an additional insurance for CAM, 18% (n\u00bc114) had none, and 17% ( n\u00bc112) did not know whether they had one (Fig. 2). In contrast, only 37% ( n\u00bc154) of the non-CAM users had an additional insurance for CAM thera- pies, 25% ( n\u00bc105) had none, and 38% ( n\u00bc158) did know whether they had one. Thirty-two percent (32%, n\u00bc313) of all respondents were convinced that all CAM therapies should be included in the basic health insurance, 29% ( n\u00bc289) stated that ''only the and 33% ( n\u00bc324) that ''only the ones prescribed or practiced by a doctor'' should be reimbursed. However, almost all respondents (96% of the CAM users and 89% of the nonusers) were of the opinion that some complementary therapies should be included in basic health insurance. Only 6% ( n\u00bc64) of all respondents would refuse inclusion of any CAM in the basic health insurance. Different types of CAM Fifty-eight percent (58%, 665 of 1143) of all respondents ad- mitted that their child had used some form of CAM.22Seventy- seven percent (77%) of these CAM users used homeopathy, FIG. 1. Respondents' per- ception of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)- and conventional medicine (CM) therapies. Re- spondents were asked to rate perceived effectiveness, side- effects, frequency of use, compliance to, and direct costs of CM therapies (black columns) and CAM therapies (white columns). Data from ordinal multiple-choice an- swers have been converted to t in a range from 0 to 1 and calculated as described under Subjects and Methods.CAM AT A PEDIATRIC EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT 47564% used herbal medicine, 24% used anthroposophic medicine, 13% used TCM, 5% used Ayurveda, and 34% used other CAM therapies (various answers possible). Respondents were also asked to specify which therapies exactly\u2014within these wide categories\u2014the pediatric patients had received, by marking or not a long list of items (Table 1). Self-medication versus therapies prescribed by physicians Respondents were asked to specify who had prescribed the respective therapies, with the possibility to mark ''auto- medication (family members, friends).'' A ratio between therapies used as self-medication and therapies prescribed by ''pediatricians, family doctors, therapists, children's hospital doctors, emergency doctors =emergency calls'' was calculated to quantify the relative rate of self-medication (Table 1) and is referred to in the present article as ''S =P-factor.'' High rates of self-medication (S =P-factor higher than 1.5) were found in some forms of homeopathy (mixed medicaments on sale and Bach flower remedies) and phytotherapy (only compresses), as well as in Ayurveda, whereas nearly three of four therapies were not prescribed by a medical doctor, and in several of the CAM therapies mentioned under others. CAM forms with lower rates of self-medication were phytotherapy (S =P-factor 0.8), classical homeopathy (1.0), anthroposophic medicine (1.3), and TCM (1.0). Parental requirements concerning CAM therapies The respondents were asked ''which medical systems should be included in the basic health insurance'' (Fig. 3), with the possibility to mark ''classical medicine'' of the respondents were convinced that some CAM therapies should be taught at the universities (Fig. 3), namely CAM users and nonusers were comparable (not shown). Discussion The present survey compared CAM with CM in terms of perceived effectiveness, side-effects, compliance, and costs, as these were experienced and communicated by the re- spondents. The results are based on the questionnaires lled out by adults\u2014in 99% of the cases parents\u2014accompanying pediatric patients presenting to the emergency unit, and re- flect the experiences that they had so far. Most of them (58%, 665 of 1143) had experienced some form of CAM.22 When asked to describe the perceived effectiveness of CAM and CM independently from each other, the respon- dents rated CAM as being somewhat less effective than CM. However, when asked to directly compare the perceived ef- fectiveness of CAM therapies with that of CM, 62% of the respondents described CAM to be either ''more effective in certain cases =against certain disorders than'' or ''equivalent effective to'' CM. We interpret these results as indicating that although the respondents had the impression that in a general way CM is more effective than CAM, the majority of the re- spondents had already experienced situations in which CAM was at least as effective as CM. The side-effects of CAM therapies turned out to be clearly more seldom and weaker than those of CM. This constitutes the most marked difference between the two types of thera- pies, which was revealed by the present survey, with the representative value for CAM being four times lower than the one for CM. Nevertheless, 6% of the respondents did no- tice weak side-effects and 1% even strong side-effects upon the use of CAM therapies, which is in disagreement with the widespread belief that CAM is harmless. Taken together, the results on perceived effectiveness and tolerability suggest that although CAM might be slightly less effective than CM, its good performance in some clinical situations and the superior tolerability leads to a high satis- faction of the users, which might explain the widespread use of CAM among the respondents (58%22). These observations seem to justify the recommendation of CAM therapies in certain situations, if accompanied by an individual assess- ment of the patient's risk situation by a medical doctor.FIG. 2. How the respondents had organized and thought about the reimbursement of complementary and alterna- tive medicine (CAM) therapies. Respondents were asked if the patients' insurance would re- imburse CAM therapies, if pa- tients had additional insurance for CAM, and whether they thought CAM therapies should be included in the basic health insurance. Data from conven- tional medicine users (black columns) and CAM users (white columns) are shown separately, in both cases as percentage of all answers. 476 ZUZAK ET AL.Slightly lower compliance and higher frequency of use were observed in the case of CAM, relatively to CM, sug- gesting different behaviors of the respondents toward the two types of medicinal systems. Interestingly, 12% of the children had never made use of CM and 17% did not use CAM ther- apies, revealing that either a considerable proportion of this population had been in very good health or that the parents refrained from going to a physician. The direct costs for the patient of both types of medicine were comparable, with a tendency for higher costs being apparent in the case of CM. In Switzerland, the costs for CM are almost entirely covered by the obligatory health insur- ance. However, the costs for CAM are at present only re- imbursed by the obligatory insurance in exceptional cases, and patients have to arrange for additional insurance if they wish CAM therapies to be reimbursed. Since a considerable number of the respondents did not have such an additional insurance for CAM, the present data on the direct costs ofboth types of medicine might indicate that in general CM is more expensive than CAM. Higher costs for CM relatively to CAM have been detected previously by PEK, when com- paring the total annual costs of CM- and CAM physicians and the corresponding medication costs.15 Fifty-three percent (53%) of the pediatric patients had an additional health insurance for CAM, corroborating the previously published value (approximately 50%15) for the entire Swiss population. While this percentage was clearly higher in the case of CAM users, it is surprising that 37% of the nonusers possess this insurance as well. A possible ex- planation for this discrepancy might be that the insurance companies often offer an additional health insurance for CAM within a commercial package that comprises several other products. The majority of all respondents (96%) were in favor of the inclusion of some CAM therapies in the basic health insurance. This value outruns the results of a Swiss voting in favor of CAM, which took place in MayTable 1.List of the Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) Therapies Mentioned by the Respondents as Being Used by the Accompanying Pediatric Patient and Corresponding Extent of Self-Medication Self-medication Prescribed CAM therapies used n 77% 406 on sale 151 23% 123 18% 65 10% 1.9 Individual medicaments (classical homeopathy) 225 34% 134 20% 139 21% 1.0 Bach Flower Remedies 347 52% 286 43% 145 22% 2.0 Phytotherapy (herbal 305 363 0.8 medicaments on sale 45 7% 38 6% 30 5% 1.3 Herbal cough tea, digestive potions, etc. 91 14% 52 8% 67 10% 0.8 Herbal creams (bronchial balsam, etc.) 122 18% 73 11% 77 12% 0.9 Compresses (with onions, vinegar etc.) 156 23% 136 20% 50 8% 2.7 Others 308 46% 175 281 0.6 medicine: (eurhythmia) 15 2% 9 1% 11 2% 0.8 Linguistic therapy, music therapy 66 10% 28 4% 52 8% 0.5 Nutrition (bioenergetic) 78 12% 8% 5% Others 0.8 TCM 89 13% 52 8% 52 8% 1.0 Acupuncture with needle 27 4% 24 4% 23 3% 1.0 Acupuncture with laser 26 25 21 1.2 Acupressure (Shiatsu) 11 22 3% 17 3% 15 2% 1.1 Kinetotherapy (yoga) 24 4% 20 3% 13 2% 1.5 Nutrition, diet 25 4% 16 2% 14 2% 1.1 Others 33 5% 23 3% 13 2% 1.8 Ayurveda 36 5% 2.7 Medicaments 13 2% 10 2% 5 1% 2.0 Massages, wellness, meditation 27 4% 24 4% 9 1% 2.7 Others 36 6% 33 7 4.7 Other therapies: 224 34% 184 28% 83 12% 2.2 Natural vitamins (supplements) 114 17% 95 14% 38 6% 2.5 Schu\u00a8ssler-salt therapy 7% 2% 4% Others 52 8% 42 6% 17 3% 2.5 aPercentage of all CAM users. CAM, complementary and alternative medicine; S =P-factor, ratio between self-medication and therapies prescribed by physician; TCM, Traditional Chinese Medicine.CAM AT A PEDIATRIC EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT 4772009; the results of this voting in the region of Zurich showed that 62.4% of the voters had a positive attitude toward CAM.24 One of our goals was to nd out exactly which therapies the pediatric patients had used. While the questionnaire used in the present survey allowed us to identify a wide variety of CAM therapies, it should be noted that no attempt was made to mention only clearly therapeutic items; some items that might be considered under the category wellness =sports were allowed. The respondents mentioned a notorious variety of CAM therapies (depicted in Table 1) as having been used by the pediatric patients. A recent survey on family doctors in Switzerland shows that 30% of them do practice some form of CAM: 34% others.25Our data corroborate that homeopathy is the most used CAM therapy, followed by herbal medicine. The detected use of anthroposophic medicine (24% of all CAM users), however, was higher and that of TCM=acupuncture (13%) was lower in the present survey. Fi- nally, neuraltherapy seems not to be practiced in children (0%). A previous report on this survey showed that two thirds of the administered CAM therapies could be attributed to self-medication.22This high extent of self-medication might be worrying because side-effects, intoxications, and inter- actions between CAM and conventional therapies can occur.26-29Some self-medication was reported in essentially all types of the CAM therapies; still, a few differences of the extent of self-medication among the various therapies were detected. The low numbers of respondents using some of the therapies mentioned under ''others'' prevent a proper interpretation of the corresponding data. The major limitations of the study are the lack of clinical data and the exclusion of respondents who could not read or write German, English, French, or Italian. The limited number of available linguistic versions of the questionnaires might explain why Swiss people seem to be overrepresented in this survey: Whereas 21% of the people living in Canton Zurich are foreigners,30only 8% of the pediatric patients were not born in Switzerland. Another explanation is that due to thelong process needed to acquire Swiss citizenship, the number of children classied as foreigners is probably much higher that the number of children actually born outside of Swit- zerland. Further limitations of our study might be a rather wide denition of CAM, the connement of the survey to one emergency unit only, and the use of common language expressions\u2014such as ''all,'' ''never,'' ''sometimes''\u2014without further (numerical) denition of what is exactly meant. Strengths of the present survey are the high number of respondents and the elevated response rate, answering of the questionnaire in privacy, and the absolute protection of ano- nymity of the respondents. Because the approach followed in a survey is markedly different from those of interventional clinical trials, our data add qualitatively different informa- tion to several trials designed to compare dened CAM therapies and CM therapies with respect to effectiveness, side-effects, compliance, and =or costs. Taken together, the data presented here show that for the respondents, adults accompanying pediatric patients pre- senting to the emergency department, the strongest differ- ence between CM therapies and CAM therapies concerned the tolerability of the two types of medicinal systems, with clearly more seldom and weaker side-effects being experi- enced with CAM therapies. Within the wide range of CAM therapies that had been used by those pediatric patients, preferences for homeopathy, herbal medicine, and anthro- posophic medicine could be detected.
