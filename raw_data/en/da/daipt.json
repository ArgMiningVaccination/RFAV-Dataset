Chronic fatigue, low energy, brain fog are all results of failure at the cellular level. SERVICES We offer a variety of techniques in order to personalize your treatment. SOLUTION What if we could effectively get your energy back without drugs? Where Does Energy COME FROM? FOOD IS ENERGY Think back to science class and the Law of Conservation of Energy: Energy cannot be created or destroyed, it can only change forms. What does this mean for you? We need to change the energy production of your body. Energy for our bodies comes from our food when it's turned into a usable form known as ATP (a molecule that cells use as a source of energy). Now enters the powerhouse of the cell - the mitochondria. You have trillions of mitochondria in your body, everywhere in your heart, muscles, gut, and so on. When food is digested and absorbed by the gut, hormones, fats, carbohydrates, and proteins enter into the mitochondria. This becomes the foundation of energy production for our bodies. YOUR BODY IS LIKE A CAR Chronic fatigue, low energy, brain fog are all results of failure at the cellular level. Picture your body as a car. When we eat, we fill our gas tanks. But having all that gas (food) is pointless if our car doesn't have spark plugs. Those spark plugs in this analogy are nutrients. Both need to be functioning otherwise, pressing down on the gas pedal won't get you very far. We need to clean out under the hood and determine what your toxin exposure, dormant infection, poor diet, or buildup of environmental offenses has caused your engine to fail. new patient special FREE Consultation Our Professional TEAM WE OFFER A UNIQUE SOLUTION TO LOW ENERGY & FATIGUE We have developed a unique program with a new approach to LOW ENERGY AND FATIGUE.
