To like my page, What Clients Say \"Lee is a powerful yet gentle healer and therapist. I have had the pleasure of working with Lee and in just a couple sessions, I feel like I accomplished more break through healing than I had the previous months of intensive therapy with a different therapist. Lee's kind and gentle approach helped me feel like I was being heard, and most importantly understood. We need more of that in our daily lives, and her techniques in assisting me to dive deep into my soul to release the negative energy and focus on rebuilding the positive light within me has helped me in countless ways find my way back to feeling like my happy self again. Thank you Lee, many blessings to you and to all who have the pleasure to work with you!\" --K.Y. \"I can hardly begin to express how grateful I am to have found Lee Edwards. She is above and beyond the most skillful therapist I could have hoped for. Lee is masterfully insightful in her guidance. She brings so much natural ability to her profession, that it is actually a beautiful thing to witness. She embodies the meaning of integrity in every aspect of her work and handled each moment of my healing process with the utmost honor and intention. Lee genuinely loves her work and has a wealth of knowledge and resources to support her clients. In my time working with Lee, she has always made me feel deeply cared for and supported. Her brilliance as a guide has helped my process immeasurably and I'm transforming my life in ways I never thought possible. Beyond her gifts as a practitioner, Lee is a lovely human being and has an absolute heart of gold. I feel so beyond fortunate to have connected with her!\" --J.B. \"I heard of Lee Edwards through a friend who had been seeing her. She described her as 'amazing' and that is exactly as I found my experience of Lee as well. I was feeling stuck in my life dealing with a difficult personal relationship and an overall lack of energy. In my sessions with Lee, we used guided imagery and energywork to go to the root of the issues which stemmed from my childhood. Her intuitiveness was awe-inspiring and very 'right on'. Her approach is respectful, caring and very insightful. The results for me were of healing and greater wholeness. She is a very gifted person. I feel more grounded, have more energy, and a greater sense of inner freedom to deal with the challenges life presents. I would highly recommend Lee for anyone wishing to explore a more holistic approach to health "}
