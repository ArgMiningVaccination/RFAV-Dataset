E-mail: gregory.panza@uconn.eduSummary Obesity affects approximately one-third of American adults. Recent evidence sug- gests that weight bias may be pervasive among both exercise and nutrition profes- sionals working with adults who have obesity. However, the published literature on this topic is limited. This review aimed to (i) systematically review existing literatureexamining weight bias among exercise and nutrition professionals; (ii) discuss the implications of this evidence for exercise and nutrition professionals and their cli- ents; (iii) address gaps and limitations of this literature; and (iv) identify future re-search directions. Of the 31 studies that met the criteria for this review, 20 examined weight bias among exercise professionals, of which 17 (85%) found ev- idence of weight bias among professionals practicing therapy ( n= 4), phys- ical fitness training ( n= 5). Of 11 studies examining weight bias among nutrition professionals, eight (73%) found evidence of weight bias. These findings demonstrate fairly consistent evidence of weight biasamong exercise and nutrition professionals. However, the majority of studies were cross-sectional (90%). Given that weight bias may compromise quality of care and potentially reinforce weight gain and associated negative health consequences inpatients with obesity, it is imperative for future work to examine the causes and consequences of weight bias within exercise and nutrition professions using more rigorous study designs.

Introduction More than one-third (36.5%) of adults have obesity in the USA (1). Individuals with higher body weight are vulnerable to experiencing stigma and discrimination because of their weight (2). While weight stigma can occur at diverse bodyweights, the highest rates (~45%) of weight discrimination are often reported among adults with class II to class III obe- sity (body mass index [BMI] 35 kg m /C02) (3,4). These stig- matizing experiences incur a range of negative consequences for emotional and physical health, including increased risk of depression (5,6), low self-esteem (7), poor body image (7),psychological distress (8 -10), continued obesity and weight gain (11), physiological reactivity (12,13), cardiovasculardisease risk factors (14) and exercise avoidance (15). Of additional concern, substantial evidence has demon- strated that medical professionals including physicians,nurses, psychologists and medical students hold negative stereotypes and biases towards patients with obesity (2,16,17). As a result, patients with obesity may receivecompromised care, be less likely to undergo health screen- ings and more likely to delay or avoid seeking healthcare (18,19). As research continues to document weight stigmain health care, emerging evidence has found weight bias toobesity reviews doi: 10.1111/obr.12743 \u00a9 2018 World Obesity Federation Obesity Reviewsbe present among both exercise professionals (e.g. personal trainers and physical therapists) (20 -22) and nutrition pro- fessionals (e.g. dietitians and nutritionists) (23). These are especially relevant professional populations to examine in the context of weight stigma, which if exhibited by exerciseand nutrition professionals may affect the way their clients respond to exercise and nutrition programmes, and/or have adverse implications for their client 's mental and physical health. Specifically, there are demonstrated links between weight bias and unhealthy weight control, binge eating (24,25), in-creased overall food intake (26), weight gain (11,12) and difficulty maintaining weight loss (27), which make it diffi- cult to adhere to or make progress with a nutrition regimen.Previous studies have also indicated that individuals with obesity who experience weight bias are less likely to partic- ipate in physical activity and physical education classes(28,29), have less desire to exercise, and decreased levels of moderate to vigorous intensity exercise (30). Thus, exer- cise and nutrition professionals who exhibit weight biasmay create a harmful cycle in which they prescribe an exer- cise or nutrition programme that inadvertently reduces the likelihood of their clients 'participation or adherence and potentially reinforce behavioural patterns that contribute to weight gain and associated negative health consequences. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the emerging lit-erature in this important area of study, the current review aimed to (i) systematically review existing literature examin- ing weight bias among exercise and nutrition professionals;(ii) discuss the implications of this evidence for exercise and nutrition professionals and their clients; (iii) address gaps and limitations of this literature; and (iv) identify future re-search directions. Methods Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) standards (31) were followed for the current review. Boolean searches were performed in PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Sociological Abstracts, ERIC, socINDEX, Academic Search Premier, Scopus andSportDiscus databases in consultation with a medical librar- ian for studies examining weight bias as an outcome among students or professionals in exercise or nutrition profes-sions. Databases were searched from inception until 7 February 2018. Eligible exercise professions included any non-physician profession that may prescribe an exercise orphysical activity regimen, such as physical therapists, phys- ical education teachers, personal/group fitness trainers, ex- ercise physiologists, exercise specialists and athletictrainers. Eligible nutrition professions included any non- physician profession that may prescribe a nutrition regimen such as dietitians and nutritionists. Databases were searchedusing keywords related to bias (e.g. stigma, stereotyping,discrimination and prejudice), body weight (e.g. over- weight, obesity, fat and body mass index), exercise profes-sionals (e.g. physical therapy, athletic trainers and personal trainers) and nutrition professionals (e.g. dietitian, dietetics and nutritionist). Exclusion of studies was based on the fol-lowing a priori criteria (i) not published; (ii) not published in English; (iii) subjects aged <19 years; (iv) editorials, com- mentaries and/or other non-research articles; and (v) studiesexamining exercise or nutrition professionals as victims of weight bias. Only studies including weight bias as an out- come and examining the presence of bias expressed by exer-cise or nutrition professionals were included. Given that weight bias has been documented in many cultures around the world (32,33), studies outside of the USA were includedif the study was published in English. A detailed search strategy is provided in Supplement 1. Results The search and selection process of studies included in this systematic review is presented in Fig. 1. A total of 31 studiesthat examined weight bias as an outcome among students or professionals in exercise or nutrition professions were in- cluded. A total of 29 studies were excluded after a full-textreview for (i) not including the study population of interest (n= 13); (ii) not assessing the outcome of interest ( n= 10); (iii) being published as a viewpoint review ( n= 4); and (iv) being published in a foreign language ( n= 2). Detailed char- acteristics for all included studies are presented in Supple- ment 2, which are summarized according to the exerciseor nutrition professional population studied. Five studies examined weight bias among exercise professionals in a clinical setting, including physical therapists ( n=4 ) (20,34 -36) and physical therapist trainees ( n= 1) (37). Eight studies examined weight bias among exercise profes- sionals in an educational setting, including physical educa-tion teachers ( n= 4) (22,38 -40) and physical education teacher trainees ( n= 4) (41 -44). Seven studies examined weight bias among exercise professionals in an exercise setting including personal/group fitness trainers (n= 4) (21,45 -47) and exercise professional trainees (n= 3) (48 -50). Eleven studies examined weight bias among nutrition professionals including dietitians/nutritionists (n= 5) (51 -55), dietetic/nutrition trainees ( n= 5) (15,56 - 59) and a mixed sample of nutrition professionals/trainees (n= 1) (60). Of the 31 included studies, one study measured only im- plicit weight bias (54), 21 studies measured only explicit weight bias (15,20,22,34 -37,39,40,46,48,50 -53,55 -60) and nine studies measured both implicit and explicit weightbias (21,38,41 -45,47,49). Implicit weight bias was assessed among the studies using the Implicit Associations Test (IAT) (61) ( n= 10) (21,38,41 -45,47,49,54). Effect sizes were cal- culated (62) and pooled for implicit weight bias results2Weight bias in exercise and nutrition G. A.

Panza et al.3 obesity reviews \u00a9 2018 World Obesity Federation Obesity Reviewsmeasured by the IAT, which included results from 10 studies (nine studies of exercise professionals and one study of nu-trition professionals). The standardized mean effect size (d= 0.68, 95% CI = 0.46 -0.89) was moderate (63) and favoured the presence of implicit weight bias across studiesmeasuring implicit weight bias. Explicit weight bias was assessed among the studies using 14 different measures in- cluding the Fat Phobia Scale (64) ( n= 7) (15,35,37,52,56 - 58), Anti-Fat Attitudes n= 10) -45,49,50), Obese ( n= (35,42,57), Attitudes Towards Obese People Scale (66) ( n= 2) (42,60), Expectations of Overweight Youth (22) ( n= 2) (22,42), Attitude Toward the Client Sur- vey (67) ( n= 1) (47), Behaviors Toward Obese and Average- weight Clients (68) ( n= 1) (47), Sociocultural Attitudes To- wards Appearance Questionnaire (69) ( n= 1) (50), Toronto Empathy Questionnaire (70) ( n= 1) (35), Youth Obesity and Physical Education Questionnaire (71) ( n= 1) (22), case scenarios ( n= 3) (39,40), developed questionnaire for the (36,38,46,48,51,55,59), experimental assess- focus ( n= 2) (20,53). In total, 11 studies (35%) examined gender differences in levels of weight bias among exercise (10 studies)(21,22,35,40,43,45,47 -50) and nutrition (one study) (57) professionals. Six of these 11 studies found significant dif- ferences among men and women. Findings were mixed,with men displaying higher levels of weight bias in two stud- ies of fitness centre employees (45) and exercise science stu- dents (50) and women displaying higher levels of weightbias in one study among exercise science students (49). Ad- ditionally, compared with men, female physical therapists more commonly displayed empathy towards individualswith obesity in one study (35), and female physical education teachers were more likely to intervene in in- stances of weight bias towards students in another study(40). Finally, nine (21,35,37,39,49,54,57,59,60) of 31 stud- ies accounted for the exercise or nutrition professional 's own body weight when examining their weight biases. Six(35,37,49,54,57,60) of these nine studies showed that the professional 's own body weight moderated their level of weight bias, such that exercise and nutrition professionalswho were under or normal weight had higher levels of weight bias. Summarized in the following are the study find- ings for all study populations included in this review. Clinical exercise professionals Licensed physical therapists Two cross-sectional studies (35,36) examined weight bias among physical therapists. Wise and colleagues (35) en-rolled 13 types of rehabilitation professionals ( N= 221), with physical therapists being the most common clinical exercise-related profession (19%), and examined their atti-tudes and beliefs towards obesity using the Fat Phobia Scaleand the Modified Beliefs About Obese People Scale. Reha- bilitation professionals, including physical therapists, dem-onstrated average levels (3.5 out of 5) of fat phobia, with higher levels of fat phobia found among younger (i.e. aged <40 years; p<0.001) and normal weight professionals (i.e. BMI <25 kg m /C02;p= 0.017). Beliefs about the cause of obesity was also a predictor of fat phobia ( p<0.001). In contrast, Sack and colleagues (36) found that 341 physi-cal therapists who completed a paper mail survey designed to assess weight-related attitudes, knowledge and practice approaches demonstrated neutral attitudes towards individ-uals with obesity. The respondents 'knowledge scores (mean = 6.7 out of 10) and attitudes regarding statements about obesity were positively correlated ( r= 0.133, p= 0.043), with higher scores indicating more positive attitudes. Setchell and colleagues (20) used an interpretive qualita- tive study design with Australian physical therapists (N= 27) to examine ways of talking about patients with overweight and obesity. The data were collected from six fo-cus groups consisting of four to six physical therapists, who typically described patients with overweight/obesity as be- ing minimally affected by stigma and difficult to treat. Thesephysical therapists also described body weight as having simple causes and being important in physical therapy. The authors suggest that physical therapists should be fur-ther educated regarding the complex understandings of working with individuals with obesity as well as weight stigma. A cross-sectional study by Setchell and colleagues(34) reported similar findings among 265 Australian physi- cal therapists. Participants in this study completed the Anti- Fat Attitudes Questionnaire and physical therapy case stud-ies with patients of varying BMI. Weight stigma was assessed by comparing quantitative responses with the case studies among people with different BMI categories and bythematic and count analysis for free-text responses. Find- ings showed that physical therapists demonstrated a mean weight bias score of 3.2 (out of 8) on the Anti-Fat AttitudesQuestionnaire. Participant responses to the case studies were not indicative of weight bias for clinical parameters such as length of treatment time or amount of hands-ontreatment with patients, but they did display explicit weight bias in free-text responses about patient management. Physical therapy trainees Awotidebe and colleagues (37) implemented a cross- sectional, quantitative study design to examine knowledgeand attitudes of 170 physical therapy students towards obe- sity. Although the students demonstrated average levels of knowledge regarding obesity on the Obesity Risk Knowl-edge Scale (mean score = 6 out of 10), more than 80% re- ported that obesity is a behavioural problem and 97.6% characterized individuals with obesity as lazy, unattractive,insecure and with lower self-esteem on the Fat Phobia Scale.4Weight bias in exercise and nutrition G. A. Panza et al. obesity reviews \u00a9 2018 World Obesity Federation Obesity ReviewsFurthermore, the underweight or normal weight students were more likely to view individuals with obesity as havingno endurance and self-indulgent. These findings highlight the importance of including weight bias as a topic of educa- tion within the physical therapy curriculum. Exercise professionals in education Physical education teachersFontana and colleagues (38) conducted a cross-sectional stratified random sampling study design to examine implicit anti-fat bias (using the IAT) among physical education pro-fessors ( N= 94) from randomly selected universities. The participants exhibited implicit 'good-bad '(p<0.001) and 'lazy-motivated '(p<0.001) anti-fat biases. Implicit anti- fat bias was also associated with disapproval of 'obese ' physical education teachers as role models to students (p= 0.047). In addition, a majority (73%) of physical edu- cation teachers agreed that physical education teachers should not be obese ( p<0.001), because they are role models to their students, but 82% believed that physical ed-ucation programmes should accept students with obesity (p<0.001). The authors indicated that the anti-fat bias demonstrated by physical education professors may have anegative effect on the training of preservice physical educa- tion teachers working with students of diverse body types. Greenleaf and Weiller (22) examined anti-fat attitudes among physical education teachers ( N= 105) and their per- formance and ability expectations for youth with and with- out high body weight. The physical education teachersreported moderate anti-fat attitudes (three out of five) on the Anti-Fat Attitudes Test and higher expectations for youth with healthy weight versus youth with overweightin skill areas of coordination ( p<0.05), strength (p<0.05), sport competence ( p<0.001), physical ability (p<0.001) and reasoning ability ( p<0.001). Peterson and colleagues (39) conducted a cross-sectional experimen- tal study of physical education teachers and coaches (N= 162). The participants were randomly assigned to read a scenario about a male and female student of average weight or overweight who were the targets of weight-basedvictimization. The physical education teachers and coaches reported a higher likelihood of intervening when the female student victim was overweight rather than average weight,specifically in situations of relational victimization (i.e. be- haviours detrimental to relationships or one 's social reputa- tion; p= 0.019). Male teachers were less likely to respond to incidents of weight-based victimization compared with fe- male teachers. The results of this study provide further evi- dence for the importance of increasing awareness ofweight-based bias among physical educators and interven- ing to address weight bias regardless of a student 's gender. With this sample, Peterson and colleagues (40) additionallyfound that physical educators 'expectations and attitudesregarding students may be negatively influenced by youths ' body weight and gender, with participants expressingpoorer performance expectations in overweight women only. Physical education trainees Readdy and Wallhead (44) conducted an interpretive quali- tative and quantitative study to examine implicit and ex- plicit weight bias among 18 preservice physical educationteachers and determine if the presence of weight bias mani- fested in the quality and frequency of teacher feedback in K-12 physical education settings. Preservice physical educa-tion teachers reported small explicit fat bias on the Anti-Fat Attitudes Scale (16.5 \u00b1 4.03 out of 25). Furthermore, educa- tors with strong implicit and explicit bias provided more feedback regardless of the student 's weight status, and those with moderate bias interacted less frequently with students perceived to be overweight, while educators with no biascommunicated equally regardless of the student 's weight status. These results suggest that some educators may change their feedback behaviours to be more encouragingfor students with overweight. O'Brien and colleagues (41) conducted a cross-sectional study to examine the prevalence of implicit and explicitweight bias among physical education ( n= 180) and psy- chology ( n= 164) students. The physical education students reported higher levels of implicit anti-fat bias than psychol-ogy students ( p<0.01) on the IAT. Third year physical ed- ucation students reported greater implicit anti-fat bias than first year physical activity students on the IAT ( ps<0.05), a finding moderated by social dominance orientation (i.e. one's amount of preference for inequality among social groups) and lower body esteem (i.e. self-evaluation of one 's body). Physical education students also demonstrated sig- nificantly higher explicit weight bias on the willpower sub- scale of the Crandall 's 13-item Anti-Fat Attitudes Questionnaire than the psychology students ( p<0.0005). Similarly, Lynagh and colleagues (42) conducted a cross- sectional study to examine implicit and explicit weight bias among undergraduate non-specialist ( n= 177) and specialist (n= 62) men ( and women ( n= 134) health and phys- ical education majors. Findings showed that non-specialist and specialist students reported implicit and moderate ex- plicit anti-fat bias, respectively. Compared with non-specialist trainees, specialists had lower expectations for children with obesity regarding their 'reasoning '(p= 0.01) and 'cooperation '(p= 0.04) skills. A third cross-sectional study by Alameda and Whitehead (43) examined levels of anti-fat bias in American ( n= 59) and Mexican ( n= 53) un- dergraduate physical education and exercise science stu-dents, as well as Mexican athletes. Students 'average total scores on the Anti-Fat Attitude Test did not reflect explicit anti-fat bias; however, the entire sample displayed signifi-cant implicit anti-fat bias on 14 of 18 subscales on the IAT.Weight bias in exercise and nutrition G. A. Panza et al.5 obesity reviews \u00a9 2018 World Obesity Federation Obesity ReviewsExercise professionals in the fitness industry Personal/group fitness trainers Fontana and colleagues (47) performed a two-phase, cross- sectional study and compared exercise recommendations, attitudes and behaviours of personal trainers ( N= 52) to- wards clients with obesity versus clients with normal weight. In phase one, personal trainers completed the IAT and watched videos of mock clients with obesity and nor-mal weight with identical health profiles with the exception of their BMI. Following the videos, the trainers provided ex- ercise recommendations for the clients and completed theAttitude Toward the Client Survey. In phase two, the per- sonal trainers met with a client with obesity or a client with normal weight, and interaction behaviours were measuredincluding the duration and the amount of exercise advice provided and the sitting distance between the trainer and client. Although the entire sample expressed significant im-plicit anti-fat bias on the IAT in phase one, there were no significant differences in exercise recommendations pro- vided (i.e. duration and intensity) or attitudes of personaltrainers among clients with obesity and clients with normal weight ( ps>0.05). In phase two, the amount of exercise ad- vice provided, duration of answers and the sitting distancewere also not different among clients with obesity and cli- ents with normal weight ( ps>0.05). Dimmock and colleagues (45) conducted a cross-sectional study to examine explicit and implicit weight bias among 70 fitness centre staff members including management and ad- ministrative staff, personal trainers, fitness instructors andexercise/sport psychologists. All participants exhibited moderately strong implicit weight bias on the IAT (p<0.01); however, levels of weight bias were the same in both exercise (IAT = 0.39) and neutral (IAT = 0.39) con- texts, indicating that weight bias among exercise profes- sionals extends outside of the fitness setting. Robertsonand Vohora (21) examined weight bias among 57 fitness and aerobics instructors and found strong anti-fat bias on the IAT ( p<0.001). In contrast, Hare and colleagues (46) found that 74% of 254 fitness instructors certified by the American College of Sports Medicine reported neutral levels of weight bias on a questionnaire developed to assess schooland medical professional 's attitudes towards obesity. While it is not clear why these results contrast with other work demonstrating higher levels of weight bias (21,45), thesefindings suggest that it may be important to assess whether the type of certification held by fitness professionals plays a role in their biases. Exercise professional trainees in the fitness industry Chambliss and colleagues (49) conducted a cross-sectional study to examine the attitudes of 246 undergraduate and graduate exercise science students towards individuals withobesity. A strong anti-fat implicit bias was found (using theIAT) against individuals with obesity, including 'good versus bad'attitude ( p<0.001) and 'motivated versus lazy ' (p<0.001). The 'good versus bad 'implicit weight bias was more evident among individuals with a lower BMI (p= 0.006). Greater beliefs in personal responsibility for obesity were also associated with stronger lazy bias (p<0.001). Sartore and Cunningham (48) conducted three cross-sectional studies and examined the impact of weightdiscrimination on perceived attributions, person-job fit and hiring recommendations in the fitness industry among university students enrolled in health and kinesiology clas-ses. Participants in all three studies evaluated applications of varying qualifications and weight statuses. In all three studies, qualified applicants who were overweight, relativeto their qualified and sometimes unqualified thin counter- parts, were judged by students to have less desirable attri- butes, considered less suitable for the position, and lesslikely to receive a hiring recommendation ( ps<0.05). These results suggest that individuals seeking employment in the fitness industry may be susceptible to weight bias. More re-cently, Langdon and colleagues (50) examined psychosocial predictors of obesity bias among 168 undergraduate exer- cise science students from two universities. Using the Fat Phobia Scale and the Anti-fat Attitudes Test, exercise science students exhibited moderate fat phobia and endorsed spe- cific anti-fat stereotypes towards individuals with over-weight and obesity, which were found to be significant predictors of obesity bias ( p<0.001). Nutrition professionals Dietitians Four studies (51,52,54,55) have examined weight biasamong dietitians using cross-sectional designs, with three (51,52,54) documenting a presence of weight bias. De Costa Cori and colleagues (51) found a high prevalence of weightbias reported by dietitians, who described individuals with obesity by greed (67.4%), unattractiveness (52%), ungainli- ness (55.1%), lack of willpower (43.6%) and laziness (42.3%). Similarly, Edelstein and colleagues (54) found that 76% of registered dietitians ( N= 128) reported moderate to strong preference ( p= 0.05) for thin people compared with people with overweight on the IAT, exceeding the test 's gen- eral population norm of 52%. In addition, registered dieti-tians with overweight had no preference for thinness, while those who were normal weight displayed bias against people with obesity. Hellbardt and colleagues (52) found that dietitians (N= 49) had an unfavourable evaluation of a person who is overweight (mean fat phobia score = 3.35) compared witha person who is normal weight (2.61; p<0.001). However, McArthur and colleagues (55) conducted the only cross- sectional study that found dietitians ( N= 23) reported am- bivalent attitudes towards clients who were overweight.6Weight bias in exercise and nutrition G. A. Panza et al. obesity reviews \u00a9 2018 World Obesity Federation Obesity ReviewsStone and Werner (53) conducted an interpretive, qualita- tive study design with four focus groups of 23 female Israelidietitians who exhibited emotional rejection of patients with obesity through instrumental, professional, and interper- sonal avoidance. Nutrition/dietitian trainees Five cross-sectional studies (15,56 -59) have examined weight bias among nutrition or dietetic trainees, three of which included control groups (15,58,59). Bacardi-Gascon and colleagues (56) found moderate fat phobia (F-scalemean score = 3.45) on the Fat Phobia Scale reported by 88% of Mexican nutrition students ( N= 630). Swift and colleagues (57) also found moderate levels of fat phobia(F-scale score mean = 3.8) on the Fat Phobia Scale among 1,130 trainee dietitians, doctors and nutritionists, with lower fat phobia predicted by higher self-reported BMIamong the participants. Only 1.4% of participants expressed 'positive or neutral 'attitudes towards individuals with overweight/obesity. Of the three controlled studies,only one (15) found a moderate level (F-scale score mean = 3.7) of fat phobia reported among 182 undergradu- ate dietetic students, who also rated patients with obesity asbeing less likely to comply with treatment recommenda- tions, and having poorer diet quality and health status com- pared with non-obese patients ( ps<0.05). In contrast, Berryman and colleagues (58) measured explicit weight bias using the Fat Phobia Scale, and McArthur (59) measured implicit weight bias using a questionnaire developed fortheir study, and neither of these cross-sectional, controlled studies found weight bias among their samples of dietetic (n= 38) versus non-dietetic ( n= 418) students, respectively (ps>0.05). Oberrieder and colleagues (60) assessed implicit weight bias using the Attitudes Towards Obese People Scale among a mixed sample of dietetic undergraduate students ( n= 64) and registered 234). Both students and regis- tered dietitians had scores indicative of negative obesity at- titudes (score >93), with no differences between the two groups ( p>0.05). However, students who perceived them- selves as having a healthy weight had a higher negative obe- sity attitude score compared with participants who self- reported as being overweight ( p= 0.043). The mixed results from studies examining weight bias among nutrition/dietitian trainees indicate the need for further re- search to examine if the amount of experience (e.g. workingyears) in the field moderates nutrition professional 's atti- tudes towards individuals with overweight/obesity. Discussion The primary aim of this review was to systematically review the current literature examining weight bias among exerciseand nutrition professionals. Thirty-one articles were in- cluded in this review; of the 20 studies examining exerciseprofessionals, 17 (85%) demonstrated evidence of weight bias among these professionals, and of the 11 studies assessing nutrition professionals, eight (73%) reported thepresence of weight bias. The studies included in our review were conducted in the USA (87%), Australia (3.2%), Brazil (3.2%), Mexico (3.2%) and the UK (3.2%), all ofwhich have similar rates of overweight and obesity (72). Collectively, this research indicates that weight bias is com- mon in both professions. In addition, weight bias was pres-ent in both women and men in these professions, and on both implicit and explicit measures of bias. Despite the emerging literature on this topic, the strength of evidencedemonstrating weight bias among exercise and nutrition professionals is variable, in part because of methodological limitations. All studies in the current review used cross-sectional designs (seven with control groups) to examine weight bias among exercise and nutrition professionals, with the exception of three studies (20,44,53) that used in-terpretative qualitative designs (i.e. in the context of an ex- perience). Longitudinal, randomized, experimental research designs should be implemented to better establishsequences of events or experiences that contribute to the on- set and persistence of weight bias among exercise and nutri- tion professionals over time. Examining weight bias amongexercise and nutrition professionals both acutely and over time will provide a better understanding of the influence that education, training and personal experiences have onwhether or not these professionals harbour and/or express weight bias in their professional practice. Additionally, there were 14 different measures used to as- sess explicit weight bias across studies in this review, all of which were self-report questionnaires or content generated from focus groups, which makes it difficult to compare re-sults because these measures may assess different constructs of weight bias. As a result, a pooled analysis could not be conducted for the results of measurements assessing explicitweight bias. Of the 20 studies examining weight bias among exercise professionals, 16 studies reported the magnitude of weight bias, which included neutral or no ( n= 1 implicit; n= 5 explicit), explicit), moderate and high ( n= 3 implicit; n=3 explicit) weight bias. Therefore, the most common levels ofweight bias found among exercise professionals were mod- erate and high for implicit (each 19% of studies) and mod- erate for explicit (38% of studies) weight bias. Of the 11studies examining weight bias among nutrition profes- sionals, nine studies reported the magnitude of weight bias, which included neutral or no ( n= 0 implicit, n= 3 explicit), low (implicit n= 1, explicit = 0), moderate ( n= 0 implicit, n= 4 explicit) and high ( n= 1 implicit, n= 1 explicit) weight bias. Therefore, the most common levels of weight biasfound for nutrition professionals was low and high forWeight bias in exercise and nutrition G. A. Panza et al.7 obesity reviews \u00a9 2018 World Obesity Federation Obesity Reviewsimplicit (each 11% of studies) and moderate for explicit (44% of studies) weight bias. Overall, weight bias was more commonly found among measures of implicit weight bias(91%) compared with measures of explicit weight bias (65%). Figure 2 provides a visual comparison of the magni- tude of implicit and explicit weight bias documented in nu-trition and exercise professionals across studies. Given that 6 of the 31 (19%) studies in this review did not find weight bias among exercise ( n= 3) and nutrition ( n=3 ) professionals in their primary outcome, it may be important to carefully examine the content and format of measure- ment of weight bias to better understand these findings.For example, the only two studies (36,55) that mailed ques- tionnaires assessing explicit weight bias did not find evi- dence of weight bias among exercise (36) or nutrition (55)professionals. It has been hypothesized that individuals completing in-person or phone call questionnaires may in- accurately report information due to limited time to com-plete the questionnaire (73), and telephone/in-person questionnaires may also lead to more extreme responses (e.g. responses that favour a positive finding) comparedwith mailed questionnaires (74). Thus, format of measure- ment (in person vs. mailed) may be an important consider- ation in assessment of weight bias. In addition, four of thesix studies that did not find weight bias among exercise and nutrition professionals used questionnaires developed specifically for their respective studies (36,46,55,59). There-fore, it is not clear if these self-report questionnaires were validated or reliable. Finally, given that studies to date have relied on self-report measures, future research should alsoseek to utilize observational, behavioural and other objec- tive assessments of weight bias. For example, observing and coding professional interactions with clients of diversebody sizes such as the two-phase study by Fontana and col- leagues (47) could provide important insights regarding the ways in which weight biases may be communicated in clin-ical settings.Another limitation of existing research pertains to sample diversity. The studies that reported gender of participants inthe current review consisted primarily of women for both exercise (sample mean = 60% women) and nutrition profes- sionals (sample mean = 98% women; Supplement 2). Somework suggests that women may experience weight stigmati- zation at higher rates than men, and at lower levels of excess weight than their male peers (3). Men are also more likely toexpress weight bias than women, particularly implicit weight bias (17,19). Only 11 studies (35%) examined gen- der differences, of which 10 were among exercise profes-sionals, and these generated mixed results. Thus, the results from these studies cannot be generalized to men, es- pecially research pertaining to nutrition professionals. Fu-ture studies should continue to examine gender differences in weight bias among exercise and nutrition professionals to help clarify the nature, extent and impact of weight biasesamong women versus men in these professional groups. The included studies 'samples also comprised primarily Caucasian/White participants. Previous studies (75) reportthat weight stigma is experienced across racial groups; how- ever, racial groups may internalize and cope with stigma dif- ferently (75), and therefore, future studies should explorerace/ethnicity as a potential moderator. In addition, less than one-third of the included studies (9 of 31) accounted for the exercise or a nutrition professional 's own body weight when examining their weight biases. Therefore, fu- ture studies should also continue to examine the exercise or nutrition professional 's own body weight as a potential moderator of weight bias. It was also not clear if the studies including samples of non-trainee nutrition professionals were credentialed or non-credentialed nutrition profes-sionals. Only one study (54) specified that their sample in- cluded registered dietitians, whereas all other studies used the terms 'dieticians 'or'nutritionists '. Future studies exam- ining weight bias among nutrition professionals should clar- ify the credentials of their sample to assess whether levels of weight bias differ among credentialed versus trainee or non-credentialed groups. Furthermore, theoretically driven stud- ies aiming to understand the reasons for, and origins of, weight bias in these professional populations could be infor-mative for advancing this field of study. Theoretical under- pinnings of weight bias have been extensively studied in the psychology literature, and it seems warranted to deter-mine how these existing (or other) conceptual frameworks for weight bias can further our understanding of this issue among exercise and nutrition professionals. Table 1 pro-vides additional directions for future research to advance understanding of weight bias among exercise and nutrition professionals. Finally, while the existing evidence has primarily focused on documenting weight bias in nutrition and exercise pro- fessions, there remains an absence of systematic research ef-forts to identify effective strategies to reduce stigma in these Figure 2 The magnitude of implicit and explicit weight bias among exer- cise and nutrition professionals reported by the included studies. Note: The magnitude of weight bias could not be extrapolated from six studies (four studies of exercise professionals and two studies of nutrition profes- sionals) based on the study 's results presented.8Weight bias in exercise and nutrition G. A. Panza et al. obesity reviews \u00a9 2018 World Obesity Federation Obesity Reviewsgroups and professional settings. A clear priority for future work is to identify ways to effectively prevent and reduceweight bias in these professions. A key part of these efforts will be identifying potential changes needed in academic curriculums to improve professional programmes for trainees so that they are knowledgeable about weight bias and prepared to deliver compassionate and sensitive careto individuals affected by overweight and obesity in their re- spective fields. This training may in part need to address in- creased acceptance of diverse body types among exerciseand nutrition professionals themselves, who can also be vic- tims of weight bias (48,76). Puhl and Wharton (77) offer additional strategies for fit- ness professionals to reduce weight bias, several of which can be implemented by nutrition professionals (15) as well. As a first step, the authors recommend increasing self-awareness of weight bias through self-reflection and exam- ining one 's own comfort level, sensitivity, stereotypes, as- sumptions and feedback towards clients of diverse bodysizes. It is also important to engage in sensitive andappropriate communication, to avoid unintentional weight bias, which includes both verbal interactions (e.g. languageused to discuss body weight) and nonverbal behaviours (e.g. facial expressions). Several recent studies examining preferences for weight-based terminology in adults indicate that certain words to describe weight are perceived to be stigmatizing and blaming and that people prefer more neu-tral language (e.g. 'weight 'and 'body mass index ') from health professionals (78 -80). Thus, it may be helpful to ask clients what words they feel most comfortable usingfor discussions about weight-related health. These findings mirror a recent resolution approved by the American Medical Association House of Delegates to improve obesitytreatment by educating medical professionals to engage in respectful, non-biased communication about obesity (81). Beyond communication, nutrition and exercise profes-sionals can create supportive facilities that accommodate clients of diverse body sizes, including the physical office en- vironment (e.g. allowing sufficient space for clients to beeasily mobile and providing sturdy armless chairs andTable 1 Directions for future research to advance understanding of weight bias among exercise and nutrition professionals Future research directions Population/domainClinical exercise professionals Compare prevalence of weight bias among clinical exercise professionals with various certifications, licences a nd degreesEvaluate inclusion of training/education on weight bias certification, licence and degree curriculum Evaluate weight bias among other exercise professionals working in a clinical setting, including clinical exercise physiologists and clinical exercise specialists Physical education professionals Assess effectiveness of weight bias education and training in programmes intended to promote physical activity among overweight and obese youthExamine whether sociodemographic characteristics of physical educators moderate levels of weight bias Exercise professionals in the fitness industryCompare prevalence of weight bias among exercise professionals in the fitness industry with various exercise certifications and degrees Nutrition professionals Conduct additional studies examining weight bias among nutrition professional trainees to clarify if the amount of experience (e.g. working years) in the field moderates attitudes towards individuals with overweight/obesity Study design Conduct longitudinal, randomized, controlled trial designs to better establish causes of weight bias among exercise and nutrition professionals Methodology Collect data on larger, more diverse samples of practitioners Include samples of equal number of men and women to better generalize results among men Assess weight bias across studies using consistent measures to confirm reliability and validity of resultsClarify if sociodemographic background (e.g. race/ethnicity, age and work experience) as well as the exercise and nutrition professional 's own body weight moderate their weight bias Examine how existing or other theoretical frameworks of weight bias can inform current understanding of this issuein nutrition and exercise professionals and its implications for their treatment practices Patient experiences Further establish the influence of weight bias on the hiring of overweight/obese exercise and nutrition professionals in their respective industries Examine the influence of having a family history of obesity on weight bias among both the client/patient and exercise and nutrition professionals Behavioural outcomes Further examine the effect of weight bias on the way exercise and nutrition professionals practice (e.g. poorer quality treatment of patients) Further examine the effect of weight bias on exercise and nutrition programme adherence Stigma reduction efforts Study client and patient responses to weight bias from exercise and nutrition professionals to help inform intervention approachesTest existing or newly developed weight bias reduction strategies in exercise and nutrition professional settings Develop a standardized weight stigma training module that is included in all health professional training certificationsWeight bias in exercise and nutrition G.

Conclusion The current systematic review adhered to PRISMA contem-porary standards (31). Findings of our review show thatthere is an established and consistent body of evidence dem- onstrating weight bias among exercise and nutrition profes- sionals, using both implicit and explicit measures of weightbias. However, these results are based on cross-sectional and interpretative qualitative study designs, and longitudi- nal, randomized, experimental studies are needed, as ismore consistent measurement of weight bias. Addressing key gaps and methodical limitations in the current literature can provide essential knowledge that can potentially im-prove academic curriculums and best-practice strategies to effectively reduce weight bias in the exercise and nutrition professions.
