The two-dose vaccine uses virus-like particles (VLP) grown in a tobacco shrub to confer immunity against COVID-19. VLPs are molecules that closely resemble a virus. They are not infectious since they do not contain genetic material. Vaccines that use VLPs train the immune system to recognize a virus and launch an attack if a person gets infected. Medicago's vaccine is different from all authorized COVID-19 vaccines. Whereas other vaccines target only the spike protein, the molecule used by the coronavirus to infect host cells, the plant-based shot uses VLPs that resemble the overall structure of the Wuhan coronavirus. A small Phase 1 study shows that recipients of the vaccine produce 10 times as many antibodies as people who have had COVID-19. The data also indicate no links to blood clots, which have been reported in people inoculated with the Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca vaccines. "}
