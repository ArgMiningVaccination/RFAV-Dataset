Specifically, the scope of project defines the approved service sites, services, providers, service area(s) and target population(s) which are supported (wholly or in part) under the total budget approved for the health center. Health centers are required to provide a set of primary health care service s described in statute and regulations. Health centers may also provide additional health services, beyond those required by statute or regulations, as appropriate to meet the needs of the population served by the health center, including certain specialty services. Any service, whether required or additional, may be provided directly by the health center or through established (formal) arrangements . The term \"established arrangement\" means an arrangement where a service is provided through a formal written contract or cooperative arrangement (section 330(a)(1) of the PHS Act). All services within the approved Health Center Program scope of project must be appropriately recorded on Form 5A: Services Provided (Form 5A) in the HRSA Electronic Handbooks Scope Module. Health centers should keep in mind the following requirements and considerations related to the delivery of services. The specific amount and level or intensity of services may vary by health center based on a number of factors including, but not limited to: the population served, demonstrated unmet need in the community, provider staffing, collaborative arrangements and/or State licensing requirements. Services provided by a health center are defined at the grantee/designee level, not by individual site . Thus, not all services must be available at every health center service site; rather, health center patients must have reasonable access to the full complement of services offered by the center as a whole, either directly or through formal written established arrangements. Once a service is included in the approved scope of project, it must be available to all patients regardless of ability to pay and be discounted in accordance with the health center's sliding fee discount program . Health centers should assure services are provided in a culturally and linguistically appropriate manner based on the target population(s). In assuring that services are appropriate for the needs of the patient population served, the health center must take reasonable steps to provide meaningful access to health center services for patients with limited English proficiency. NOTE: HRSA considers specialty services to be within the broad category of \"additional\" health services, defined in section 330 as services that are not included as required primary health care services and that are (1) necessary for the adequate support of primary health services and (2) appropriate to meet the health needs of the population served by the health center. Refer to PIN 2009-02: Specialty Services & Health Centers' Scope of Project . Service Descriptors for Form 5A: Services Provided 2 Overview The Form 5A service descriptors outline the general elements for all services, both Required and Additional, to assist in accurate recording of the approved Health Center Program scope of project. The descriptors are broadly written to acknowledge the variety of staff and provider types that may deliver any one service and to ensure individual health centers understand where and how to appropriately record the services they provide within the Health Center Program scope of project on Form 5A. For example, in the case of obstetrical care, the service may be provided by a family practice physician, certified nurse midwife, OB/GYN physician, and/or other appropriate provider. Additionally, both clinical and non-clinical workers (e.g., physician assistants, registered nurses, promotoras, community workers, doulas) may provide or support the delivery of a service. All providers must be properly credentialed and privileged (i.e., appropriately trained and licensed) to perform any service(s), activities and/or procedures on behalf of the health center. (For further information, review the Health Center Program Compliance Manual, Chapter 5: Clinical Staffing .) In addition, health centers must ensure that any/all Federal, State and local standards/accreditation requirements of the facility where the service is provided have been met. NOTE: Key benefits that health centers should consider and/or actively plan to address prior to requesting a change in scope include Medicaid and Medicare FQHC reimbursement, FTCA coverage (eligible to grantees only), and 340B Drug Pricing benefits for a specific service, as appropriate. While identification within a scope of project is required for participation in these programs, it is not a guarantee that these benefits will be realized. Each of these programs has a specific application process and a comprehensive set of requirements, of which scope of project is only one Descriptors for Required Services Health centers are required to provide, either directly or through an established arrangement, a set of primary health care services. The descriptors for the Required Services provide a \"floor\" for what elements, at a minimum, are included for a particular service. In addition, where applicable the descriptors: Provide detail as to what \"may\" (but is not required to) be included for a particular service to account for health centers that may provide a more expansive or an intense level of a service. In these instances, a separate change in scope (CIS) request is not needed. Identify a \"ceiling\" that clarifies what is not included in a particular service and thus where a separate change in scope request is required. Descriptors for Additional Services When considering what additional services to provide, health centers should thoroughly investigate the costs, benefits, and risks before making such decisions. In general, a health center must prioritize making required primary health services available to all patients before proposing to add additional health services, including additional specialty services. Each health center must determine whether adding additional services as part of approved scope of project is appropriate for the population served, demonstrated unmet need, and other relevant factors. The descriptors for Additional Services: Provide detail as to what \"may\" (but is not required to) also be included for a particular service to account for health centers that may provide a more expansive or an intense level of a service. In these instances, a separate change in scope request is not needed. Service Descriptors for Form 5A: Services Provided 3 Identify a \"ceiling\" that clarifies what is not included in a particular service and thus where a separate change in scope request is required. Specialty Services are recorded under Additional Services, on Form 5A. When a proposed specialty service change in scope request is approved, only those aspects of the specialty service, described within the change in scope request, will be included within the approved scope of project.

Service Descriptors for Form 5A: Services Provided 6 REQUIRED SERVICES 5A Service Service Descriptor Statute Reference Regulation Reference General Primary Medical Care General primary medical care services are comprehensive and address prevention as well as acute and chronic conditions. At a minimum, these services include assessment, diagnosis, screening, education and treatment; referrals; and follow- up of such services. Any referrals are based on the provider's documented assessment of the health center patient, indicating the medical necessity for referral(s) to other health-related services (including but not limited to specialty, mental health and substance use disorder services). Follow-up of services includes the medical coordination of ongoing treatment involved with the transfer or discharge planning of health center patients in various settings.

At a minimum, these services are inclusive of plain medical films. All other types of advanced diagnostic radiology (e.g., CT, MRI, diagnostic mammogram, advanced ultrasound, advanced imaging or nuclear medicine) are considered specialty services. NOTE: Other service descriptors reference associated diagnostic radiology services that are included in the scope of project of the related service. For instance, screening mammography is considered a screening service; basic obstetrical ultrasounds are a prenatal service; basic gynecology imaging (i.e., ultrasound) is a gynecology service; and dental x-rays are part of preventive and additional dental services.

After the health center's regularly scheduled hours, at a minimum, after hours coverage includes the provision of telephone access through clearly defined written arrangements, to an individual who has the qualification and training (consistent with licensing requirements in the health center's jurisdiction) to exercise professional judgment in assessing a health center patient's need for emergency medical care and if appropriate, who can then refer patients to a covering physician or licensed or certified independent practitioner, and/or to locations such as emergency rooms or urgent care facilities for further assessment or immediate care. A patient's need for emergency medical care might arise from an emergent physical, oral, behavioral and/or other health need and therefore, the health center's after hours arrangement must have the capacity to address comprehensive emergent health situations. The coverage arrangement must include provisions to facilitate follow-up by the health center for patients accessing after hours coverage, as appropriate.
