You know that quitting smoking will definitely improve your overall health and [longevity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1447499/), but that doesn't mean it's easy to do. [Acupuncture treatment can reduce](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6662782/) cravings, [alleviate withdrawal symptoms](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-addiction-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) of nicotine, and help relieve anxiety you feel when you stop smoking. Smoking tobacco causes several million unnecessary deaths every year, and is associated with multiple chronic diseases, including lung disease, cardiovascular disease, [diabetes](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-diabetes-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), lung cancer and other types of [cancer](https://myartofwellness.com/acupuncture-and-tcm-for-cancer-integrative-oncology/). But deaths related to smoking are just the tip of the iceberg. [According to the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/fast_facts/index.htm), over 16 million Americans are currently living with a chronic disease caused, at least in part, by smoking. Smoking increases the risk of [stroke](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-help-stroke-recovery-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [erectile dysfunction in men (ED)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-ed-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [low sperm count](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-oligospermia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid [arthritis](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-arthritis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). On average, smoking takes ten years off a person's life. Why do we keep doing this to ourselves? Because once you have a smoking habit, quitting smoking is very hard. Tobacco contains a natural chemical called nicotine. [Nicotine](https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/health-information/nicotine-addictive-chemical-tobacco-products) is a highly addictive substance. It acts upon the neurotransmitters in the brain that release dopamine: the \"feel-good\" chemical. When you inhale tobacco smoke, nicotine goes directly to your brain, and you get an immediate \"reward\" in the form of dopamine. Once your brain gets used to this reaction, it wants more of it. Even when you know you should stop smoking, and you want to quit, a part of your brain is signalling you not to stop. Vaping, or smoking from a vape pen, or e-cigarette, is the latest trend. There has been some suggestion that this form of smoking causes less damage than cigarettes do, because Juul pens don't have many of the toxic additives that are in regular cigarettes. So far, researchers don't know how long-term vape use will affect people's overall health. However, it is clear that people who vape can easily become [just as addicted to nicotine](https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/vaping-nicotine-addiction) as smokers of cigarettes, cigars, and pipes do. Once the brain has become attuned to the dopamine reaction [caused by nicotine,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2928221/) a very powerful social-emotional component is added to the physical, chemical component. Being in a place where you have smoked in the past, seeing a friend who smokes, smelling smoke in the air, and of course, seeing an ad for cigarettes-all these sorts of cues in your daily environment can have a dramatic impact on your desire to smoke. Almost half of all smokers in the U.S. make an attempt to quit smoking each year. But, obviously, people fail in their attempts to stop smoking all the time. Nicotine withdrawal symptoms include intense anxiety. When faced with a powerful combination of physical and emotional stress, most people will return to that quick fix. Even when a person develops serious problems due to smoking, like a constant cough, [emphysema](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-emphysema-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [sleep apnea/snoring](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-stop-snoring-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [infertility](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-infertility-in-women-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [acid reflux/heartburn](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-acid-reflux-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), loss of smell and taste; even when a person knows that second hand smoking can hurt their loved ones, they still may find it impossible to quit. People need help to quit smoking. Typical [smoking cessation aids](https://www.cancer.org/healthy/stay-away-from-tobacco/guide-quitting-smoking/nicotine-replacement-therapy.html) include nicotine gum or patches, medications, and programs designed to educate and support people as they try to overcome smoking addiction. While these methods offer help, they do not work for everybody. Most people have to try to quit smoking many times and try different methods before finding success. Many people gain weight when they quit smoking, because the cravings for a cigarette are replaced by cravings for sweets or other foods and drinks that keep your hands and mouth occupied. It's more than just an oral habit, though; nicotine affects the way your body uses insulin and releases glucose, so when you quit smoking, there is a very real change in blood sugar levels and a subsequent desire to eat more carbohydrates. When it feels like you have to choose between two different risk factors-being a smoker, or being overweight-,it may seem like a hopeless situation. TCM for smoking cessation offers a different, multi-pronged approach. With acupuncture treatment for nicotine addiction, we can work on several of the problems smoking causes at the same time. Using [acupuncture to stimulate](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/want-to-quit-smoking-acupuncture-can-help-you-with-cravings/) specific pressure points for reducing cravings and alleviating symptoms of smoking withdrawal is only one way that TCM can help people quit smoking and regain good health. Our [TCM detox program](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-detox-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) may also be helpful. Top 10 Symptoms of Nicotine Withdrawal When you try quitting smoking \"cold turkey,\" you will probably feel more severe symptoms of withdrawal for the first few days. Withdrawal symptoms can last for several weeks. Nicotine withdrawal symptoms include: - Intense cravings for a cigarette that last for 5-10 minutes - Feelings of [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/)and [stress](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-stress-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) - Food cravings, weight gain, rise in blood sugar - Sleep problems, insomnia - Persistent cough, \"smoker's cough\" - Flu-like symptoms: fever, fatigue, Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) has been the common [form of help](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/whats-best-way-quit-smoking-201607089935) for nicotine withdrawal for decades. This involves using nicotine patches, nicotine gum, or lozenges, which help people gradually wean themselves off of nicotine by lowering the dose over time. Nicotine patch side effects can include a rapid heart beat, dizziness, [headaches](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-headaches-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and nausea. Medications such as Zyban and Chantix are also used to help people quit smoking. Zyban (Bupropion) is also known as Welbutrin, which is used to treat [depression](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-depression-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). A prescription medication called [Varenicline (Chantix)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK534846/) is the newest medical treatment available to help people stop smoking. Varenicline works by blocking the receptors in the brain that react to nicotine to stimulate dopamine production. Varenicline is still fairly new, and researchers do not yet know the long-term effects of taking it. Common Chantix side effects include nausea, [insomnia](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/insomnia/), and headaches; more serious psychiatric reactions, such as depression and suicidal ideation have also been reported. Drug interventions for smoking cessation are more effective when combined with education and counseling. The most effective methods to help people stop smoking treat both the brain chemistry that is causing nicotine addiction and the emotional symptoms that arise when quitting. TCM methods of acupuncture and herbs are naturally able to help address addiction because they work on the whole person-physically, mentally, and spiritually. How Can Acupuncture Help You Quit Smoking? In conventional medical terms, we mostly think of cigarette smoking as being harmful to the lungs, due to smoke inhalation, and the cardiovascular system, due to the well-known fast heartbeat we associate with nicotine use. In TCM, we do consider that smoking weakens the lungs, but this, in turn, causes problems in the other major organ systems of the body. A buildup of heat in the Heart and Stomach can lead to stagnant Liver Qi. These forces are what cause the withdrawal symptoms of anxious feelings, heart palpitations, irritability, food cravings, and poor sleep. [With acupuncture](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-10857-0_16) and herbs, we work to clear heat and detoxify the lungs and all of the organs. A [specific set of points](https://myartofwellness.com/ultimate-guide-to-the-acupuncture-point-on-head-for-headaches/) on the outer ear are often used to help combat the cravings associated with overcoming addictions of all kinds, including nicotine dependence. Often we will send a patient home with small ear seeds fixed to these points so that they can be squeezed and stimulated whenever you feel an urge to smoke. This will also help with food cravings and prevent overeating and weight gain when you quit smoking. Acupuncture helps to release endorphins, replacing the familiar dopamine hit with a different sense of relaxation. Endorphins promote a sense of wellbeing and relieve pain. Dopamine works on the reward center of the brain, causing a mental and emotional reaction that leads to addiction. Acupuncture treatment works holistically to help relieve emotional pain-symptoms of anxiety and depression-by positively impacting neurochemical activity. Shifting from dopamine dependence to more abundant endorphins and serotonin will help restore restful sleep. A [controlled trial study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1447300/) compared patients who received acupuncture, patients who received acupuncture and education and counseling, and patients who received sham acupuncture to help them quit smoking over a period of four weeks. The percentage rate of patients who had quit smoking after 18-month follow up was highest among those who received acupuncture, and especially highest among those who had acupuncture and counseling. [A study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5149689/) of almost 3000 people who received acupuncture treatment for smoking over an eight week period showed that the treatment helped many people abstain from cigarettes, and helped many more to cut back on how many cigarettes they smoked. Chinese Medicine Near Me to Stop Smoking in the Great Los Angeles Area The decision to quit smoking for good can be a life-changing one. But for most people, it's also one of the most difficult things they will ever do. Cigarettes are addictive, and to stop smoking, you may need professional help. If you've already tried NRT and not been able to finally quit, you may want to consider trying the TCM approach. Whether you chain smoke or only vape socially, whether you are quitting smoking because you want to increase your chances of getting pregnant, or you have lung cancer stage 4, it is never too early or too late to stop smoking. Acupuncture for smoking cessation can help you get past the cravings for cigarettes that make it so hard to quit. Acupuncture and herbs can not only help you kick the habit, but can also help you get rid of that cough, brighten your skin, and sleep better. Most of all, you will have made an important choice to prioritize your health and prevent chronic illness from taking hold later in life. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

Traditional Chinese Medicine is based on Qi, which is an invisible force that usually cannot be observed by modern science.

[ The Ultimate Guide to the Acupuncture Point on Head for Headaches ](https://myartofwellness.com/ultimate-guide-to-the-acupuncture-point-on-head-for-headaches/) by Xiaomei Cai, L.Ac., Ph.D. & Qineng Tan, L.Ac., Ph.D. Why does the TCM doctor always put an acupuncture needle in top of head? If you've had acupuncture before, it's likely that your acupuncturist used some acupuncture points on head during your treatments. Using pressure points on the head is something TCM doctors do often, because there are so many useful acupressure points on the head, especially acupuncture points top of head. There are head pressure points for [headaches](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-headaches-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), points to relieve [migraines](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-migraine-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), acupressure head points to help anxiety, fatigue, allergies, and many other conditions. Even if you're coming in for acupuncture to help some other condition, whether it's chronic pain, an autoimmune disease, heart problems, or kidney problems, probably at some point your acupuncture practitioner is going to use acupoints on head to help you relax during your treatment. Every single person who comes into our office for acupuncture is suffering from some form of stress, and using [certain points on the top of the head](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2016/4943204/) can help with [stress relief](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-stress-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) right away. Other common reasons to use pressure points in neck and head include: - to fight [fatigue](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-fatigue-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - headache and migraine - allergies, [asthma](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-asthma-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), problems, [common cold](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-the-common-cold-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - anxiety [nervous disorders](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3833481/) - thyroid disorders - hormone imbalances - more [mental focus](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-adhd-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), improved memory and Meniere's disease](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-menieres-disease-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) [toothache, dental pain, dental anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-toothaches-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) Why are pressure points on the head so powerful? To answer this question, let us explain a bit about the meridian system in TCM. TCM Meridian Head Points TCM is based on interdependent systems of organs and [energy channels](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2014/836392/) that run through the body. The channels are known as meridians, and along them flows Qi, the life energy that animates the body and all of its functions. There are 12 major meridians and 8 major vessels; the meridians are close to the surface of the skin, and the vessels, which essentially connect all the meridians, are deeper inside the body. While the way in which we think of the [meridian pathways](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2005290110600143) is more metaphorical than physical in nature, they can be considered roughly analogous to the circulatory system of blood vessels or the network of nerves of the nervous system as we think of them in conventional Western medicine. Along the meridians lie acupoints, specific points that we stimulate with acupuncture needles during acupuncture treatment or with the fingers and thumbs during acupressure massage. The interconnectedness of the organs, meridians, and individual points is the foundation of acupuncture theory. We use specific points on a meridian in order to address issues in a particular organ or organ system that corresponds (energetically) with that meridian. There are several pressure points for head and neck pain, points to help relieve allergies, pressure points for frontal headache, and more. Several of the major meridians originate or end in the head: - Gall Bladder (GB) meridian - points of the gall bladder meridian wrap around the side of the head, the forehead above the eyebrow, the temple, around the ear, and down the back side of the neck-just as the pain of a migraine often does. Then it continues down from the intersection of the neck and shoulder, zig-zagging across the torso, and finally running down the leg and ending in the fourth toe. This meridian is used to treat severe headaches, stress, tension that affects the shoulder and neck, and bile-related problems. - Large Intestine (LI) meridian - begins at the points of the index finger, travels up the arm, through the shoulder and neck, then comes up to the lower corner of the nose. This meridian is involved in \"letting go,\" both from the eliminatory organs of the lower body, and exhalations from the nose. - Stomach (ST) meridian - the ST meridian starts near the eye, swoops up to the side of the top of the head, comes down next to the mouth, and continues down through the neck, chest, center of the body, down the leg, ending at the point of the second toe. [This meridian](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/stomach-meridian)is used to treat Shen (spirit) disorders, like insomnia, anxiety, palpitations, memory problems, and blood deficiency. - Small intestine (SI) meridian - originates in the little finger, runs up the arm into the shoulder and then branches out, some of it going into the major organs of the heart, stomach, and small intestine; then other branches go up into the face, by the cheekbone and right in front of the center of the ear. The SI is used to treat fevers and mental health conditions, among other things. - Bladder (UB) Meridian - begins at the inner canthus of the eyes, goes up and over the top of the head, about an inch away from the midline on either side, and then all the way down the back and leg, ending in the little toe. Used to help with invasion disorders (wind, cold, heat etc.) that affect the eyes, sinus headaches, allergies, [stuffy head](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-the-common-cold-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [neck pain and stiffness](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-get-rid-of-neck-pain-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). - Triple burner meridian, also known as San Jiao (SJ) - begins at the tip of the ring finger, then goes up the arm, through the shoulder and chest, up the side of the neck and comes up around the ear, and into the temple and outer brow bone. The San Jiao head points are used to work on dizziness, headaches, eye twitching, and [dental pain](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-toothaches-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). - Conception vessel - also known as the Functional Channel, or the Front Channel, or Ren Mai, this vessel originates at the navel, then drops down to the perineal area, and runs back up the center of the front of the body, ending in a point on the chin, in the dip just under the lower lip. This vessel controls the Yin energy of the body and is essential to the health of the reproductive organs and [fertility](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-infertility-in-women-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). - Governing vessel, also known as the Extraordinary vessel, the \"Sea of Yang\" or Du Mai - originates in the lower back near the kidneys, runs up the spine and around and over the top of the head, ending in the middle of the face. This vessel controls the Yang energy of the body, and in particular the kidneys, the back and spine. Top 10 Acupuncture Points on Head Of course, your acupuncturist will not only use acupoints on your head during a treatment session. We choose a variety of points that will work together to alleviate symptoms and help optimize the functioning of the organs. These specific head points may be used as part of a treatment to work on a specific symptom or condition: - Yin Tang, or the \"Hall of Impression\" - this is what is called an \"extraordinary point,\" meaning it doesn't really belong to a meridian; it stands on its own. Right in the third eye, it is used to reduce anxiety, [vertigo (dizziness)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-dizziness-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), help promote better sleep, clear wind and congestion, and relieve sinus pain and headache. - DU21 - [Shen Ting](https://www.acufinder.com/Acupuncture+Points/DU+24+(GV+24)/370), \"Spirit Court\" - Right in the front middle of the top of the head, about an inch above the hairline. This is one of the pressure points for frontal headache, also good for sinusitis, nosebleeds, anxiety, [panic attacks](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-panic-attacks-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and sleep problems. - DU 20 - Baihui, or \"The meeting of the 100s\" - right in the very center of the top of the head, master of endocrine and nervous system, used for [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), fatigue, mental focus, relaxation, hypothyroid, adrenal problems, hormone imbalance, headaches. - Si Shen Chong - \"Four Alert Spirit\" - this is actually a set of four \"extraordinary points,\" which surround DU20. Very helpful for sleep disorders, [memory disorders](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-amnesia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), dizziness, and headaches. - GB20 - Feng Chi, \"Wind Pool,\" low back of the head, where the skull meets the neck muscles, helps headaches, migraine, [blurred vision](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-glaucoma-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), fatigue, neck pain and stiffness. We may use this point when a patient has [a cold](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-the-common-cold-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/); this is a point where cold wind can get into the body, and why it is important to wear a scarf to protect your neck when it's cold and windy out. - Taiyang \"Great Sun\" - Right in the depression of the temple, this point can help dizziness, one-sided headaches, migraines, sensitivity to light, and jaw pain, TMJ. - GV26 Shui Gou - in the mustache area, between the nose and mouth, right in the center of the crease, this point helps to calm the mind and restore mental focus. Also used as first aid when a person faints or is in shock. Helps stop hiccups. Helps with serious neurological disorders like [epilepsy, seizures](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-seizures-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). Also good for low back strain. - LI20 Ying Xiang \"Welcome Fragrance\" - located in the lower corner of the nose, right in the nasolabial groove, used to alleviate congestion, allergy itching in the nose, and to clear the nasal passages. - ST8 - Touwei, about 5 finger widths above the eyebrow, dispels dampness, used for \"splitting headaches,\" frontal headache, migraines, headache with nausea and/or vomiting, vision problems, tearing eyes, eye twitching, dizziness/vertigo, hair loss. Helps with mental health, when a person is \"overthinking\" things, or having repetitive thoughts. - BL2 - Zhanzhu - located at the inner corner of the eyebrow, good for itchy, watery eyes due to allergies, other eyes problems like glaucoma, night blindness, and sinus headache. Facial Acupuncture Points As we have mentioned, some pressure [points on the face](https://www.healthline.com/health/pressure-points-for-face) are used to help relieve sinus congestion, nasal congestion, and other issues related to common colds and flus or allergies. Points on the face may also be used to help the [facial paralysis](http://koreascience.or.kr/article/JAKO201517058945069.page) of [Bell's Palsy](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-bells-palsy-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), or [TMJ jaw pain](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-tmj-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). Naturally, we also use acupuncture points on the face as acupuncture points for the face, that is, when we are striving for facial rejuvenation. This technique is sometimes called an acupuncture facial. Using points on the face can help to stimulate collagen production, help to tighten the skin, reduce the appearance of wrinkles, and strengthen the facial muscles. People of all ages and genders can benefit from acupuncture skin care. Cosmetic acupuncture can [treat signs of aging skin](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-aging-skin-with-cosmetic-acupuncture/) like sagging, puffiness under the eyes, and dryness. Self-Care With Acupressure Head Points What is acupressure? Acupressure is a form of massage that goes back thousands of years in Chinese Medicine. Stimulating the same points we needle in acupuncture treatment with your fingers and thumbs can be beneficial for different types of headaches and neck stiffness, to calm anxiety, and bring more mental clarity. Choose a time when your environment is quiet and free of distractions, the same as you would for a meditation practice or home workout. Be sure to breathe deeply and smoothly as you perform self-acupressure. Press firmly, applying deep pressure to a point in a small, gentle circular motion. Giving yourself an acupressure treatment only takes a few minutes, and it is a great way to take care of yourself between acupuncture sessions. Acupuncture Near Me for Headaches and More Every time you come in for acupuncture treatment, your TCM doctor is looking for ways to treat your overall condition, but also focusing on how you are feeling right now, today. Often, people are feeling tired and stressed, beyond and in addition to the health condition that caused them to seek out alternative medicine in the first place. Using points on the head that help fatigue, calm a racing mind, and reduce the physical effects of stress is one way that your acupuncturist is practicing preventative care, while at the same time, making sure you leave your treatment feeling rested and reenergized. The next time you come in for a visit, be sure to let us know how you're feeling, and feel free to ask us, \"What is that point on my head for?\" *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

[ How to Stop Snoring With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-stop-snoring-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) By Qineng Tan, L.Ac., Ph.D. & Xiaomei Ph.D. Have you been told you're snoring loudly? Do you feel tired even after 8 hours of sleep? Waking up with a dry mouth, feeling tired all the time, and having trouble staying asleep at night are all signs that you might have [sleep apnea](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sleep-apnea/symptoms-causes/syc-20377631). Sleep apnea is a sleeping disorder in which normal breathing is interrupted repeatedly. Acupuncture and TCM offer a natural way to treat obstructive sleep apnea, [insomnia](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/insomnia/), [fatigue](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-fatigue-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and other sleep-related problems. Sleep Apnea (also known as sleep apnoea) is when a person does not breathe normally during sleep. When there is a pause in normal breathing during the night, the body is not getting enough oxygen, and the brain sends an urgent message to start breathing again. The person wakes, so briefly that they usually do not remember it, gasps for air and starts breathing again. Often people do not realize that they are [snoring](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/snoring) or making snorting or choking sounds while they sleep unless another person tells them it's happening. Because of this, many cases of sleep apnea go undiagnosed, and people go on feeling fatigued all the time. While people of any age or gender can experience sleep apnea, it is most common among older men. There are a few different kinds of sleep apnea; the most prevalent type is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), in which the throat and/or airway is physically obstructed by the positioning of the neck, jaw, and soft tissues of the throat, like the tongue and uvula. [ OSA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5836788/) is associated with being overweight or obese, because extra weight can affect the musculature of the upper respiratory system. Women who have already gone through [menopause](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-menopause-symptoms-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) are more likely to develop sleep apnea because postmenopausal weight gain is more likely to occur in the upper body than it does prior to menopause. Sleep problems and obesity are related in many ways; getting less sleep or poor quality sleep can cause people to gain weight or have trouble losing weight. People with [diabetes](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-diabetes-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and/or metabolic syndrome are also at higher risk for obstructive sleep apnea. Besides disturbing sleep and causing fatigue, apnea can lead to [other serious health conditions](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/the-dangers-of-uncontrolled-sleep-apnea), especially cardiovascular problems like [high blood pressure](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-high-blood-pressure-with-acupuncture-tcm/), [irregular heartbeat](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-irregular-heartbeat-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and [stroke](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-help-stroke-recovery-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). Sleep apnea can increase the heart rate and the production of [stress](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-stress-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) hormones. Men with OSA are more likely to experience [erectile dysfunction](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-ed-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) (ED). Lack of quality sleep can also have a negative impact on mental health, contributing to [depression](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-depression-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), and [cognitive decline](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-amnesia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). The typical treatment for snoring involves the use of a sleep apnea machine, called a CPAP machine (continuous positive air pressure machine), which pushes air into the nose while you sleep, ensuring that the airway stays open and continuously active. This treatment can help people breathe easier throughout the night, but some people may find the machine noisy and uncomfortable. TCM methods like acupuncture treatment for snoring and sleep apnea offer a way to address these problems at their source holistically, helping people to [sleep well](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-sleep-better-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and breathe more freely. Top 3 Types of Sleep Apnea Sleep apnea causes loss of oxygen due to shallow breathing (hypopnea) and/or interrupted breathing while sleeping. Different [types of sleep apnea](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/sleep-apnea) are classified by their physiological causes: - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) - this is caused by the improper relaxation of the throat muscles while sleeping. - Central sleep apnea (CSA) - is caused by disordered signalling from the brain to the organs that control breathing. - Complex sleep apnea - (or treatment emergent sleep apnea) is a combination of both of the above. Restless legs syndrome (RLS), also known as Willis-Ekbom disease, is a condition wherein a person has an uncontrollable urge to move the legs, or sometimes arms or other parts of the body, accompanied by a sensation of itching, burning, crawling or throbbing. This usually happens when the person is lying in bed, trying to fall asleep. [Restless leg syndrome](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9497-restless-legs-syndrome) can coexist with OSA, compounding the problem by making it difficult to get to sleep or stay asleep during the night. Narcolepsy is a sleeping disorder in which overwhelming sleepiness during the daytime causes people to suddenly and uncontrollably fall asleep. Many people who suffer from [narcolepsy also have sleep apnea](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19699146/). In this case, the sleep problem is not related to breathing so much as how the brain and body are moving through sleep cycles, like REM sleep. For people who have narcolepsy, treatment with a CPAP machine is often not very helpful. Sleep apnea or snoring does not seem to be related to other abnormal sleeping behaviors (parasomnia), such as sleepwalking, night terrors, or sleep-related eating. Top 10 Symptoms of Sleep Apnea Many people snore and do not realize it. It is important to pay attention to the subtler sleep apnea symptoms. Signs of sleep apnea include: - Loud snoring - Interrupted breathing - moments during the night when the person's breathing actually stops and then starts again - Gasping for air while sleeping - Waking up with a dry mouth or [sore throat](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-a-sore-throat-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Headaches in the morning - Insomnia, difficulty getting to sleep or staying asleep during the night - Feeling very sleepy during the daytime (hypersomnia) - Difficulty paying attention - Feeling irritable - Getting up often during the night to [urinate (nocturia)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-uti-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) What Causes Snoring? Sleep apnea is caused either by a physical obstruction of the throat and airways or by problems with brain signals to the breathing apparatus. Not everyone who has sleep apnea snores loudly. On the other hand, not everyone who snores necessarily has sleep apnea. Other reasons people snore may include: - Congestion of the nose due to a cold or [allergies](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-allergy-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - In late [pregnancy](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/pregnancy-support/), the growing belly puts upward pressure on the respiratory system - Sleeping pills, medications that work as relaxants, like Ativan or Valium - Alcohol consumption - Anatomy - large tongue or uvula, or swollen tonsils People with sleep apnea are often advised to sleep on their side rather than on their back, as this helps prevent the obstruction, but it can be difficult for people to control their behavior while sleeping. Treatment for Sleep Apnea To firmly establish whether a person has sleep apnea, and what type, doctors will often evaluate the situation in a sleep study session. People will spend the night in a sleep center, where their heart and breathing functions are monitored (polysomnography). CPAP machines are generally considered to be the best care available for sleep apnea. These devices can help stop snoring, allow a person to get more restful sleep, and cut the risks of serious issues like heart disease that are associated with sleep apnea. However, the machine does not actually do anything to improve the weak musculature that causes OSA or the disordered signalling that causes CSA. It is possible to swallow air while breathing with the CPAP machine, which can lead to gas and a [bloated stomach](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-bloated-stomach-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). Some people may find the face mask, which must be strapped to the face, uncomfortable. The noise of the machine may be disturbing to the person using it, as well as to the person's bed partner. It may be difficult for some patients to get used to using the machine, and if they are not using it regularly, they are not getting the health benefits. There are also some oral appliances available, such as [mandibular advancement devices (MAD)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5803051/), which are worn in the mouth to alter the placement of the jaw and tongue in order to keep the airway open during sleep. These can also be effective in terms of helping people breathe better while they sleep. Compared to CPAP, they are quiet, discreet, and cost-effective. Again, the main question is whether a person will be able to tolerate the device; some people may experience [toothache or dental pain](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-toothaches-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [TMJ jaw pain](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-tmj-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), dry mouth, or too much saliva. Surgery for snoring and sleep apnea is usually only recommended if other methods of treatment have failed. Different procedures involve removing soft tissues (uvula, tonsils, adenoids), or changing the shape of the jaw bones. Small rods may be inserted into the upper palate to help keep the airway open. A device that monitors breathing and stimulates movement of the tongue may be implanted in the chest. Sometimes people may use melatonin as a natural sleep aid. [Melatonin may](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02484300) have a positive impact in terms of helping people fall asleep more easily. It also has strong antioxidant properties, which means it may help with the control of the breathing apparatus and the amount of oxidation a person is getting while sleeping. While it is generally considered safe as a health supplement, [melatonin side effects](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/melatonin-side-effects#TOC_TITLE_HDR_6) can include problems with dizziness, headaches, and nausea, and it can also be contraindicated with other medications. Melatonin can affect blood coagulation, so it may be unsafe to take if a person is also taking blood thinners, for example. Can Acupuncture Help Stop Snoring? According to TCM theory, the spleen and stomach are responsible for transforming nutrients from food and fluids into Qi (life energy), which is then delivered to the heart and lungs. In the TCM view, sleep apnea is often a problem related to phlegm and Qi stagnation, as are many conditions related to fatigue or insomnia. If phlegm builds up and becomes stagnant in the spleen, the lungs cannot get the Qi they need. So, one possible differentiation for sleep apnea is Spleen Deficiency with Qi Stagnation. This condition of dampness and phlegm will often cause people to feel heavy and bloated. In some cases, too much internal heat contributes to the problem. Snoring, combined with sweating, and waking up with a sore throat, is a sign that we need to clear heat and toxicity from the body. Sleep disturbed by nightmares is associated with the gallbladder, while difficulty falling asleep is associated with the liver. An acupuncture practitioner will listen carefully to what specific symptoms of sleep apnea each individual patient is experiencing, and tailor the treatment accordingly. A [meta-analysis](https://www.healthcmi.com/Acupuncture-Continuing-Education-News/1674-acupuncture-found-effective-for-sleep-apnea-relief-beats-cpap-for-blood-oxygenation) of over 200 randomized trials involving the use of acupuncture to treat sleep apnea concluded that acupuncture was more effective overall than CPAP treatment, in terms of improving breathing and oxygen levels. Can Chinese herbs help snoring and sleep apnea? Specific herbs [have been shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4998001/) to help reduce inflammation and improve oxygen levels in patients with sleep apnea. Chinese [herbal formulations can help](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22298445/) stop snoring and reduce daytime fatigue. Natural Remedies for Snoring Acupressure can help snoring and sleep apnea. Since we are trying to clear heat and phlegm from the stomach, spleen, and large intestine, use acupressure points along the Stomach Meridian, which runs down the leg. On the front of the shin, apply pressure, kneading with your thumb, starting to the side of the shin bone a few inches below the knee, then moving down about 3 inches and doing the same thing. Knead each of the four points about 30 times as your move down the leg. If you are aware that one side of the nose is more blocked than the other while you are breathing during the night, practice the acupressure on the opposite leg. For example, if your left nostril is the one that is more stuffed up, do acupressure on the right leg. Acupuncture Near Me for Snoring As the population ages, and unfortunately, more people suffer from obesity and metabolic syndrome, sleep apnea is a growing health concern all over the world. Snoring can have a seriously negative impact on quality of life, health, and longevity. Conventional methods of treatment for sleep apnea can be effective, but many people find CPAP uncomfortable and inconvenient for long-term use. If you suspect you may have sleep apnea, or are worried because your partner snores loudly at night and seems to be gasping for air, do not wait to get help. Acupuncture and TCM herbs can help relieve fatigue due to snoring and reduce the risk of more serious problems related to sleep apnea. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

[ How to Treat Musculoskeletal Pain With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-musculoskeletal-pain-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) Ph.D. & Xiaomei Cai, L.Ac., Ph.D. Do you experience unexplained pain all over the body? Muscle pain and tenderness, along with feeling tired all the time and having mood issues? Widespread musculoskeletal pain accompanied by fatigue or feeling exhausted may be a sign you have fibromyalgia. Alternative medicine methods like Acupuncture and TCM offer a way to help ease the [chronic pain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3658605/), [sleep problems](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-sleep-better-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and emotional disturbances caused by [fibromyalgia](https://fibroandpain.org/fibromyalgia/what-is-fibromyalgia). Fibromyalgia (sometimes referred to as \"fibro\" or FM) is one of the [most common](https://fmaware.net/fibromyalgia-prevalence/) chronic pain conditions worldwide, affecting an estimated 10 million people in the United States alone. Still, this chronic condition is still not well understood by medical science. There are no definitive tests to show whether or not fibromyalgia is the cause of pain all over the body along with chronic fatigue, so many people go on having musculoskeletal problems and hurting all over without being diagnosed or treated. There are many people who have fibromyalgia who also suffer from [depression](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-depression-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) related to the illness. [Fibromyalgia](https://www.healthline.com/health/fibromyalgia) can dramatically impact a person's quality of life. While people of ages and genders can have fibromyalgia, it is much more prevalent among women. Fibromyalgia is considered to be a syndrome: a collection of symptoms that often occur together. Fibromyalgia is associated with other conditions like [lupus](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-lupus-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [rheumatoid arthritis (RA)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-rheumatoid-arthritis-ra-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic [fatigue](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-fatigue-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) syndrome (ME/CFS). It may coexist with these other chronic conditions, or sometimes be mistaken for one of them. However, fibromyalgia is now understood by medical professionals to be its own distinct condition with specific manifestations. People who have [RA have been shown](http://blog.arthritis.org/rheumatoid-arthritis/rheumatoid-arthritis-side-of-fibromyalgia/) to have an increased risk for also having fibromyalgia. But the quality and location of the musculoskeletal pain differentiates the two conditions. The pain of fibromyalgia shows up in the musculoskeletal system in the areas where there are large muscles, causing pain that may move around throughout the torso, [back, hips, thighs](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-hip-pain-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and arms. Fibromyalgia pain is often described as a kind of \"tenderness,\" or when the body aches all over. \"Tender points\" all over the body are specific to fibromyalgia. This is [different from arthritis](https://www.arthritis.org/diseases/fibromyalgia?_ga=2.91328922.1871329779.1619451838-775333886.1619451838), which generally causes swelling and pain in the joints. Both RA and [lupus](https://www.hss.edu/conditions_Lupus-and-Fibromyalgia.asp) are understood to be caused by inflammation, while fibromyalgia is believed to be caused by a problem with the central nervous system (CNS), in which pain signals are amplified, causing extreme sensitivity and pain, even when there is no seeming reason for that area of the body to feel pain. Some of the fibromyalgia symptoms are very similar to those of myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), which is also known as chronic fatigue (CFS). As with RA and lupus, the two conditions can overlap. The difference is that the overwhelming symptoms of ME/CFS are related to fatigue or post-exertional malaise (PEM), while the predominant symptom of fibromyalgia is widespread muscle pain and tenderness. Fibromyalgia seems to show up in some people due to a traumatic or triggering event. There can then be a fibromyalgia flare up due to the presence of other triggers later. Fortunately, acupuncture, herbs, and other forms of alternative medicine that fall under TCM can approach all of the different symptoms of fibromyalgia holistically. Acupuncture is widely accepted to be effective for helping musculoskeletal conditions of all kinds, as well as neurological problems, rheumatological conditions, sleep issues, and emotional and mental health disorders. Top 10 Symptoms of Musculoskeletal Pain As a syndrome, fibromyalgia may manifest as any combination of a few or several of a variety of symptoms. The most common symptoms of [fibromyalgia](https://www.cdc.gov/arthritis/basics/fibromyalgia.htm) include: - Widespread musculoskeletal pain: pain, tenderness, and/or stiffness in the muscles all over the body that may come and go or migrate from one area to another - Fatigue, exhaustion, extreme tiredness - Emotional and/or mental issues: depression, anxiety, PTSD - Sleep problems, hands and/or feet [TMJ,](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-tmj-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)jaw pain - Digestive problems: [irritable [bloating](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-bloated-stomach-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) [Bladder pain, interstitial cystitis](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-uti-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) Other more subtle signs of fibromyalgia can include: [ itching](https://www.prohealth.com/library/fibromyalgia-itching-causes-make-stop-91719) all over, a skin crawling sensation (like bugs crawling on skin), extra sensitivity to smells or temperature, a tendency to shiver, or dry eyes or eye pain. Top 5 Causes Musculoskeletal Pain Flares The [symptoms of fibromyalgia](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/fibromyalgia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354780) tend to come and go. Some days a person might feel almost totally fine, then other days, the fibromyalgia flares, causing more pain, exhaustion, and sometimes other symptoms. What triggers a fibromyalgia flare up? - Hormonal changes during menstrual cycle, [miscarriage](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-prevent-miscarriage-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), pregnancy, or postpartum - Prolonged [stress](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-stress-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) - A sudden [traumatic event, PTSD](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-ptsd-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)trigger, [panic attack](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-panic-attacks-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Changes in weather: temperature, humidity, barometric pressure - Lack of sleep When one of the 18 tender points of fibromyalgia is touched, it can trigger more widespread pain. These points include areas like: the front and sides of the neck, the base of the skull, the elbow, and the backs of the knees. What Is the Treatment for Fibromyalgia? Medical [treatment for fibromyalgia](https://fmaware.net/fibromyalgia-treatment/) typically involves a combination of medicine to alleviate pain with psychological support and lifestyle management. [Drugs](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/living-fibromyalgia-drugs-approved-manage-pain) like Lyrica, Cymbalta, and Savella are approved for prescription for patients with fibromyalgia. Lyrica and Cymbalta are also used to treat conditions that involve nerve damage or nerve pain, like [diabetes](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-diabetes-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), neuropathy, [shingles](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-shingles-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), while Savella works in a way that is similar to antidepressants. Other [pain relievers](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-help-dependence-on-hydrocodone-and-other-opioid-pain-medication-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and/or antidepressant medications may also be prescribed to help people manage pain of fibromyalgia, help them sleep better, and boost mood. All of these medications can come with unwanted side effects, and they do not help to relieve pain in every case. People with FM pain will often receive counseling on how to manage their condition by being very careful not to exert themselves or become exhausted. Getting quality sleep and reducing stress can help to prevent fibro flare up. It can be hard for people to follow guidelines that ask them to make major lifestyle changes. Fortunately, acupuncture, herbs, and the patient support of a TCM practitioner can offer more help for people with fibromyalgia. Acupuncture for Musculoskeletal Pain Can acupuncture help fibromyalgia? Yes. TCM offers a comprehensive system for managing musculoskeletal pain and chronic pain, helping to heal nerve damage and restore central nervous system function, supporting mental health, relieving anxiety and depression, and addressing sleep problems. Whereas with conventional medicine, a patient might go from one doctor to another to handle all of these issues, the acupuncturist can address them all at once. The TCM point of view always takes into consideration the connection between what is going on physically with what is going on emotionally in each individual, so it is really an excellent way to help patients with fibromyalgia. Like Western medicine, TCM recognizes that sometimes fibromyalgia can be originally caused by a traumatic event or an extremely stressful time in one's life. Emotional upheavals cause stress to the liver, which in turn causes stagnation of blood and Qi. TCM also sees coldness and dampness as pathogenic forces that can have a profound effect on overall health. According to TCM, widespread musculoskeletal pain falls under the category of Bi Syndrome. In Bi Syndromes, cold and damp get into the body and take hold on a deep level, causing pain and stiffness. With [acupuncture treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4223771/) for fibromyalgia, we seek to clear cold and damp, and restore good flow of Qi and blood throughout the body. Acupuncture has an analgesic effect, relieving muscle pain without side effects. Moxibustion may be utilized to bring warmth to areas of the body. Cupping is another modality used to draw out damp cold and improve blood flow. Tai Qi and Qi Gong, gentle therapeutic movement practices that have been developed over 1000s of years as part of TCM, also may offer great benefits for people with FM. A [systematic review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6365227/) of over 400 studies of fibromyalgia treatment with TCM, acupuncture treatment was found to be effective for reducing both short term pain and long term pain. Another [review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3110829/) found that acupuncture and herbs worked better to reduce pain than standard medication therapy. Top 5 Tips for Managing Fibromyalgia Dealing with fibromyalgia and seeing significant improvement in fibro pain will probably involve making some lasting lifestyle changes. Making adjustments to your sleep habits, food choices, and your exercise routine can make a difference in preventing the next FM flare up. - Choose a gentle, enjoyable form of exercise. Start slowly, and gradually increase the amount you can exercise over time. Walking outdoors is a great option, as are Tai Qi and Qi Gong. - Limit or eliminate caffeine and alcohol. These substances can interfere with getting good sleep and exacerbate liver problems. Alcohol is not safe to consume if you are taking medications for fibromyalgia like Lyrica, Cymbalta, and Savella. - Avoid sugar, which may give you a short-lived good feeling, but will lead to a \"sugar crash,\" and feeling more exhausted than before. Any kind of simple carbohydrates, like foods made of white flour, or bottled fruit juices, can cause highs and lows in blood sugar. Avoid sugar substitutes and food additives like MSG, which can trigger reactions in some people. - Focus on eating complex carbohydrates, especially vegetables. These help you have a more sustained energy throughout the day. Nuts and seeds are also good. - Warm baths with Epsom salts can be very soothing. Getting enough sleep at night, and even resting or napping during the day, may be essential to your well-being if you have fibromyalgia. Develop habits that allow for plenty of rest and set yourself up for a good night's sleep. Acupuncture Near Me for Musculoskeletal Pain Many people who have fibromyalgia choose to try alternative medicine as a way of managing FM pain. Physiological conditions that stem from emotional stress are often not resolved through the use of medications. Acupuncture and TCM have a long history of helping people to heal from emotional disturbances that cause physical pain. Acupuncture treatment works to increase the flow of energy through the body and improve the connections between the brain and nerve endings. If you or someone you know suffers with fibro, consider acupuncture as a way to find relief from musculoskeletal pain and constant fatigue. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

[ How to Treat ADHD With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-adhd-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) child have ADHD? Do I have ADHD? [ADD/ADHD](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/adhd/symptoms-causes/syc-20350889) is a mental health disorder that causes children and adults to have problems with concentration, hyperactivity, or both. Trouble in school, problems at work, physical restlessness, mood swings, and frequent feelings of frustration can all be signs of ADHD in children and adult ADHD. Acupuncture and TCM offer a way to help symptoms of ADHD holistically, without the side effects caused by ADHD medications. ADD stands for Attention-Deficit Disorder, referring to the poor concentration and problems staying on task that are often experienced by people with this neurodevelopmental disorder. Children and adults with ADD are easily distracted; they may appear to be \"daydreaming\" a lot of the time. ADHD stands for Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, in reference to cases in which a person also exhibits impulsiveness, or difficulty sitting still. ADHD usually starts in childhood; often, ADHD symptoms carry over into adulthood and continue to cause problems if not addressed. While ADHD in adolescents and children has been studied widely in recent years, the causes are still unknown. It is generally believed to be due to disordered biological processes occurring in the brain, and considered to be possibly genetic in origin. [ADHD](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/adhdadd) may be related to atypically low levels of chemical neurotransmitters like dopamine. Metabolism in the part of the brain that controls attention, movement, and social interaction appears to be different in brain imaging tests of children with ADHD. For children with ADHD, this may lead to problems in school, even learning disabilities. Interrupting, not being able to wait their turn, fidgeting, and being forgetful or seeming \"careless\" are the obvious outward signs of ADHD that can make school challenging for children, and cause them to be considered disruptive in the classroom. Adult attention disorder may show up as reckless behavior (traffic tickets, accidents, etc.), problems in relationships, trouble organizing things like paying bills or missing appointments, losing belongings, not being a \"good listener,\" or anger management issues. According to current conventional medical thought, ADHD is considered a psychiatric condition: a product of chemical imbalance in the brain. ADHD in children is associated with behavioral problems that make it difficult to excel in school. Adults with ADD may have trouble finding success in their daily work and lives. For these reasons, people will consider getting medical treatment for ADHD. As with most psychiatric issues, treatment tends to focus on a combination of behavioral counseling and pharmacological intervention. Medications used to treat ADHD in both children and adults are stimulants that are thought to help boost attention span and a person's ability to focus. Acupuncture and TCM herbs can be used as an adjunct therapy or an alternative to medical treatment with drugs for ADHD in both children and adults. Top 3 Types of ADHD: ADD or [ADHD symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/diagnosis.html) manifest in a unique combination in each individual. Presentations of ADHD are divided into three categories: - Inattentive/easily distracted type - Hyperactive, impulsive behavior type - Combined type, exhibits both inattention and hyperactivity While boys are statistically more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD, this may have something to do with the fact that [ADHD symptoms show up differently in girls](https://www.verywellmind.com/adhd-in-girls-symptoms-of-adhd-in-girls-20547) than they do in boys. Parents and teachers may have a stronger tendency to explain girls' behavior as being personality-based (\"talkative\" or \"tomboy-ish\") rather than a serious problem worthy of attention. Girls may also be more likely to compensate for their ADHD, finding coping mechanisms that help them get along with teachers and appear to be OK, even if they are struggling with schoolwork or social problems. [ADHD and ASD](https://chadd.org/about-adhd/adhd-and-autism-spectrum-disorder/) (autism spectrum disorder) can often present in similar ways, and can coexist in some cases. Over half of people who have been diagnosed as autistic also show signs of ADHD, while about a quarter of people with ADHD are also considered to be on the autism spectrum. Some of the key differences between these two neurodevelopmental disorders are that children with ADHD are much more likely to show improvement in their behaviors as they grow up, and that people with ASD are more likely to exhibit \"hyperfocus\" rather than distraction. When symptoms of ADHD are found in children, it is not unusual for parents to recognize that they, too, have faced similar struggles in their lives. [ Research suggests](https://exceptionalindividuals.com/neurodiversity/what-is-adhd/) that about half of the time that a child is diagnosed with ADD or ADHD, at least one of their parents shows signs of the disorder, as well. Top 10 Symptoms of Adult ADHD Because ADD/ADHD is a mental health issue, it can be difficult to clearly identify. Many of the symptoms associated with ADHD are similar to those of [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/). It is not uncommon for people with adult ADHD to also have anxiety or [depression,](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-depression-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) so the conditions overlap. - Trouble focusing on tasks or multitasking, poor concentration - Impulsive behavior, recklessness - Disorganization - Poor time management skills, difficulty prioritizing or staying on topic - Restlessness, [sleep problems](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-sleep-better-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Easily frustrated - Frequent mood swings - Lose temper easily - Difficulty articulating thoughts to others - Difficulty coping with [stress](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-stress-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) Of course, everyone experiences some or all of these behaviors and emotions at some point in their lives. But if these problems began in childhood and continue to cause problems in daily life on an ongoing basis, then it may be due to [adult ADHD](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/adult-adhd/symptoms-causes/syc-20350878). Test for ADHD Evaluation for ADHD is usually performed by a mental health professional, pediatrician, or family physician. There is no one specific test to determine if a child or adult has ADHD. [Diagnosis](https://chadd.org/for-adults/diagnosis-of-adhd-in-adults/) is usually based on a comprehensive discussion with the patient and family members to determine whether a person displays 5-6 or more commonly recognized symptoms of ADD or ADHD, according to guidelines set by the American Psychiatric Association. Brain imaging methods such as MRIs are used to conduct research about ADHD, but they are not part of a typical diagnostic process for the average person. Medications for ADHD [Doctors commonly treat](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/health-issues/conditions/adhd/Pages/Determining-ADHD-Medication-Treatments.aspx) ADD or ADHD with stimulant medications that increase levels of dopamine and norepinephrine and are meant to help them focus better. These medications are based in amphetamine (Adderall, Dexedrine, etc.) or methylphenidate (Ritalin, etc.). Some are short-acting and need to be taken in 4-hour intervals; others are longer-acting, or designed to last all day. While these [medications](https://www.verywellmind.com/adhd-medication-20882) are considered safe for children, they do not work in every case, and they carry a variety of side effects, including: changes in appetite, stomach problems, and sleep problems. These types of drugs constrict the blood vessels and can cause heart problems like arrhythmia, [high blood pressure](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-high-blood-pressure-with-acupuncture-tcm/), and even heart attacks in some patients. They can also have a negative impact on mood and mental health, causing a child or adult to become even more irritable and/or anxious. In some cases, stimulant medications have been [linked](https://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/childhood-adhd/news/20060323/adhd-drugs-reports-aggressive-behavior) to suicidal ideation and aggressive behavior in children and adolescents. Acupuncture for ADHD TCM philosophy acknowledges the interconnectedness of the mind, spirit, and body. In the TCM view, problems like ADHD are concerned with imbalances of the Heart, the Mind, and the Shen (spirit or emotions). Pathogens like fire, wind, and dampness can invade the head, affecting the mind as well as the physical organs of the body. Problems with concentration and restlessness stem from wind and excess heat in the head. Feelings of anger and frustration are often rooted in Liver Qi stagnation. Troubles with the appetite and digestion are often connected to deficiency in the Kidneys and Spleen. Thus, acupuncture treatment and herbal preparations will be designed to clear heat, get Liver Qi moving freely, and strengthen the Spleen and Kidneys. The [medications often prescribed to treat ADHD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7041317/) can actually have further negative effects on the heart and kidneys, causing deficiencies of Liver Qi and Kidney Qi. A [research study](https://www.healthcmi.com/Acupuncture-Continuing-Education-News/1647-acupuncture-improves-outcomes-for-children-with-adhd) conducted with almost 600 children showed that acupuncture had an 84% efficacy rate. [A study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0965229910000944) to test the effectiveness of electro-acupuncture on preschoolers with ADHD found not only that the majority of children showed improvement of symptoms, but that the improvement was still evident at a six-month follow-up. Auricular acupuncture, in which points on the outer ear are stimulated with very tiny, thin needles or seeds that can be stuck to the ear and gently massaged daily, can be [particularly effective for children](https://www.pacificcollege.edu/news/blog/2014/07/28/treating-adhd-with-acupuncture), as it is very minimally invasive. Certain herbs used in formulations to address attention deficits [have been shown](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2018/3052058/) to help improve learning and [memory](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-amnesia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). Acupuncture Near Me for ADHD If you or your child is struggling with attention deficits or impulsiveness, it can be stressful and scary to decide what to do about it. Poor concentration and hyperactivity can get in the way of doing well in school or work, and make it difficult to have positive social interactions and form relationships. It is certainly important to address these issues rather than ignoring them and hoping they'll go away. However, many people are concerned that medications may have negative side effects, or be habit-forming. You may want to consider acupuncture as a natural way to address ADHD. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

Traditional Chinese Medicine is based on Qi, which is an invisible force that usually cannot be observed by modern science. Because science focuses on testing ideas about the natural world with evidence obtained through observation, these aspects of acupuncture can't be studied by science. Therefore acupuncture and Chinese herbs are often not supported by double-blind, randomized trials, and they are considered alternative medicine therapies in the United States. "}
