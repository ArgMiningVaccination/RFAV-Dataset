This research examines trends in coverage of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in five prestigious medical journals during a period of intense reorganization within medicine (1965-1999). Content analysis of a sample of documents (N 102) shows the medical profession responded to the growth of CAM in three distinct phases. During each phase, changes in the medical marketplace\u2014such as relaxed medical licensing, the development of managed care, rising consumerism, and the establishment of the Office of Alternative Medicine\u2014 influenced the type of response in the journals. From the late 1960s to the early 1970s, during the condemnation phase, authors ridiculed, exaggerated the risks, and petitioned the state to contain CAM. In the reassessment phase (mid-1970s through early 1990s), increased consumer utilization of CAM prompted concern, and authors pondered whether patient dissatisfaction and shortcomings in conventional care contributed to this trend. Throughout the 1990s, in the integration phase, struggles to outlaw CAM were abandoned, physicians began learning to work around or administer CAM, and the subjugation of CAM to scientific scrutiny became the primary means of control. This analysis demonstrates the evolutionary process of professionalization, a process in which dominance is sustained through adaptation to structural change. Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine 2010 The history of CAM in USA has run a long and persistent course in the annals of medicine. Medicine has dominated the citizens for over 150 years ever since the establishment of a formal patriarchal American Medical Association (AMA) in 1847. The association has fought many wars of tufts, resistances and uprisings against them. Despite this, the medical profession is losing their grip of power, and is slowly and seemingly fragmenting. An obvious strong reason is the rise and re-rise of CAM. This is the situation in USA now. 2015 The purpose of this dissertation is to reflect on the author's published work in the field complementary and alternative medicine, specifically that produced between 1996 and 2005. It examines how the production of this work was influenced by the author's previous and concurrent experience as a medical journalist and the methodological challenges arising from sourcing complementary and alternative medicine and framing for audiences of broadsheet newspapers and two books - The Which? Guide to Complementary Medicine and Alternative Answers to Asthma & Allergies. It explores how this work relates to scholarship in three key areas: the theory of sourcing, the theory of framing and the study of erroneous beliefs. The author demonstrates that a \"perfect storm\" - sociologically, culturally and economically - created a narrative that suited the new consumer-driven cult of the empowered individual, which in turn led to most sectors of the print media becoming impervious to any real investi... International Journal of Clinical Practice 2010 Australian family physician Qualitative Health Research 2014 Commentators such as Goldacre, Dawkins, and Singh and Ernst are worried that the rise in complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) represents a flight from science propagated by enemies of reason. We outline what kind of problem CAM use is for these commentators, and find that users of CAM have been constituted as duped, ignorant, irrational, or immoral in explaining CAM use. However, this form of problematization can be described as a flight from social science. We explore CAM use in light of a rigorous and robust social scientific body of knowledge about how individuals engage with CAM. By pointing to the push and pull factors, CAM user&amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;s experiences of their body, and the problem of patient choice in CAM use, we summarize some of the key findings made by social scientists and show how they trouble many of the reasoned assumptions about CAM use. BMC complementary and alternative medicine 2016 Medical pluralism has flourished throughout the Western world in spite of efforts to legitimize Western biomedical healthcare as \"conventional medicine\" and thereby relegate all non-physician-related forms of healthcare to an \"other\" category. These \"other\" practitioners have been referred to as \"unconventional\", \"alternative\" and \"complementary\", among other terms throughout the past half century. This study investigates the discourses surrounding the changes in the terms, and their meanings, used to describe unconventional medicine in North America. Terms identified by the literature as synonymous to unconventional medicine were searched using the Scopus database. A textual analysis following the method described by Kripendorff 2013 was subsequently performed on the five most highly-cited unconventional medicine-related peer-reviewed literature published between 1970 and 2013. Five commonly-used, unconventional medicine-r... British Journal of General Practice 2009 2008 Loading Preview Sorry, preview is currently unavailable.
