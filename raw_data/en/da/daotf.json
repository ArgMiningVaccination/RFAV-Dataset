Last updated: June 30, 2023 Very rarely a person may need to delay vaccination because of severe allergies, illness or severe reaction after the first dose. If you have concerns, discuss with your health care provider about how you can safely receive the vaccines. Review the HealthLink BC files on the: COVID-19 vaccines can be safely given at the same time or any time before or after any other live or inactivated vaccine. This includes the Influenza vaccine. If you are getting a COVID-19 vaccine you do not need to delay getting an influenza vaccine. It's especially important to protect yourself against respiratory viruses during cold and flu season. If you get any two vaccines at the same time or close together the healthcare provider will usually administer the vaccines in different arms/limbs. Getting a COVID-19 vaccine if you are pregnant, planning to get pregnant or breastfeeding is the safest choice to protect you from COVID-19. Open: [COVID-19 vaccine planning guide for people who are pregnant or breastfeeding](/Health-Info-Site/Documents/COVID-19_vaccine/COVID19_Vaccine_Perinatal.pdf) This document is available in: [ (Ukrainian)](/Health-Info-Site/Documents/COVID-19_vaccine/Vaccine_Perinatal_UKR.pdf) | [ (Russian)](/Health-Info-Site/Documents/COVID-19_vaccine/Vaccine_Perinatal_RUS.pdf) The [Canadian Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology (SOGC)](https://www.pregnancyinfo.ca/covid/), the [National Advisory Committee on Immunization](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/immunization/national-advisory-committee-on-immunization-naci.html) (NACI) and public health experts in B.C. all agree that people who are pregnant and breastfeeding should get the vaccine. Pregnant people are at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19 infection and can be vaccinated at any time during pregnancy or while breastfeeding. - If you are unvaccinated and infected with COVID-19 during your pregnancy, you are three times more likely to end up in the intensive care unit (ICU) than those infected with COVID-19 who are not pregnant. - Preterm birth and admission of baby to neonatal intensive care units have been shown to be more common among pregnant people with COVID-19. - There is currently no known serious risk (such as an increased risk of miscarriage or possible birth defect) of getting a COVID-19 vaccine while pregnant or breastfeeding (or providing expressed human milk) to either the person being vaccinated or the child. - There is no need to avoid starting or stopping breastfeeding if you get a COVID-19 vaccine. - The vaccine helps your body to produce antibodies that will protect you from getting sick if you are exposed to COVID-19. These protective antibodies pass into your milk and may also protect your child from infection.

There is misinformation circulating about COVID-19 vaccines and infertility. COVID-19 vaccines do not cause infertility and there is no scientific reason or biological way they would impact fertility. Some people have reported changes to their menstrual cycle following vaccination. However, it is important to know that a number of factors can impact the menstrual cycle, including sleep, stress, infection, diet and exercise. In fact, getting COVID-19 itself may impact the menstrual cycle, as more than 35% of individuals noted changes in their menstrual cycle after COVID-19 infection. While studies are taking place to understand this potential impact, we know that other vaccines have not impacted the menstrual cycle.

Vaccine is the best way to help develop immunity. If you've recently had a positive COVID-19 test result, you can wait up to 3 to 6 months for a booster dose. Both vaccination and COVID-19 infection provide immunity. Vaccination is a safer because it is not associated with the serious illness that COVID-19 can cause. Vaccines have been shown to be highly effective in preventing serious illness and death, even after you have had a COVID-19 infection. If you are due for a COVID-19 vaccine booster dose and recently had a positive COVID-19 test result, you can either: - Defer your booster dose for 3 to 6 months, as the likelihood of a COVID-19 reinfection during this period of time is small because having COVID-19 boosts your immunity. Waiting at least three months is preferable as immunizing shortly after infection may interfere with development of immunity resulting from that infection. - Get your booster dose at any time after your symptoms have passed and you have fully recovered or within a few months of infection. This may interfere with infection induced immunity but you may have other reasons why you feel you need a booster dose earlier. This document is also available in the following languages: If you have an allergy to an ingredient of one type of COVID-19 vaccine, you are still able to receive the other type. Speak with your care provider if you have questions. You should not get an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (Moderna/ Pfizer-BioNTech) if you have had a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to: - Polyethylene glycol (PEG), an ingredient in both the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines. PEG can be found in some cosmetics, skincare products, laxatives, cough syrups, and bowel preparation products for colonoscopy. PEG can be an additive in some processed foods and drinks, but no cases of anaphylaxis to PEG in foods and drinks have been reported. - Any component (part) of either the Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine - People who experienced a severe immediate allergic reaction after the first dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine can safely receive future doses of the same or another mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. - Consult with an allergist or ask your primary care provider to explore options. - You will be asked to stay in the clinic for 30 minutes after getting the vaccine so you can be monitored. By staying in the clinic, a health care provider can respond in the event you experience a reaction. Tell a health care provider if you feel unwell after your vaccine. Previous reactions to non-COVID-19 vaccines do not mean that you should not get a COVID-19 vaccine. Ask your health care provider whether there are any similar ingredients in the vaccine that you had a reaction to and COVID-19 vaccines. If there are none, it is safe to get the COVID-19 vaccines. If you have a history of any of the following it is still safe to get the COVID-19 vaccines: - X-ray dye allergy - Bee and wasp stings allergy - Food allergies - Environmental allergies such as to pollen or dust mites - Recurring anaphylaxis of unknown origin (idiopathic anaphylaxis) - Systemic Mastocytosis - Chronic hives - Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS) - Contact allergy to propylene glycol (PG) For more information on allergies and COVID-19 vaccination check the [ FAQs](https://csaci.ca/covid-19-vaccines-faq/) from the Canadian Society of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. People who have medical conditions are still able to receive the COVID-19 vaccines. The health conditions below are NOT contraindications for COVID-19 vaccines. You should still get vaccinated if any of these apply to you. If you are currently taking medication or undergoing treatment it is still safe to get the COVID-19 vaccines. If the medication you are taking suppresses your immune system, check with your healthcare provider about the best time to get the COVID-19 vaccine to ensure an optimal immune response. Anyone with the following is able to get mRNA COVID-19 vaccines: - History of thrombosis following a previous dose of an adenovirus vector COVID-19 vaccine-like AstraZeneca/COVISHIELD - History of capillary leak syndrome - History of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) Vaccine considerations for children are similar to adults. The vaccine can be given to children who take medications regularly, including youth with conditions that make them [clinically extremely vulnerable](/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/covid-19-vaccine/vaccine-considerations). Vaccination should be delayed for 90 days following MIS-C (the rare multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children). Learn more about [COVID-19 vaccinations and children](/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/covid-19-vaccine/vaccines-children). People who have had COVID-19 should be immunized with COVID-19 vaccines. You should wait until you have recovered to get immunized. Some people with specific health conditions or taking specific treatments are considered clinically extremely vulnerable. Here you will find information and resources about getting the COVID-19 vaccine if you are part of this group. A third dose of COVID-19 vaccine is recommended for some people who are moderately to severely immunocompromised. Booster doses are recommended for everyone 12 years and older.

A third dose of COVID-19 vaccine is recommended for some people who are moderately to severely immunocompromised. A third dose of COVID-19 vaccine is recommended for some people who are moderately to severely immunocompromised. COVID-19 vaccines are not live vaccines, and there are no significant concerns about safety for those with weakened immune systems. It is possible that the vaccine may not work as expected in people who have a weakened immune system. If you have questions and have a weakened immune system, speak to your healthcare provider about the COVID-19 vaccine. A third dose of COVID-19 vaccine is recommended for some people who are moderately to severely immunocompromised.
