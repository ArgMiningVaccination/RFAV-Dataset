While many of us are conditioned to take a pill to alleviate a symptom, this approach does not always lead one back to health. Naturopathic physicians strive to determine underlying factors that lead to signs and symptoms rather than erase these important clues with strong agents. When your doctor is a licensed Naturopathic doctor, you can expect a consultation that assesses and values all aspects of well being. This standard of care is philosophically based allowing you, with your doctor's guidance, to individualize treatment. This gentle process assembles an intricate balance between the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual components of health. Active participation in this process by the patient empowers personal stewardship towards well being and lasting preventative health. Naturopathic physicians are licensed to practice medicine as primary care physicians in 14 states, District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U. S Virgin Islands. Medical training consists of 2 years of basic science training and science board exams after the second year, and a subsequent 2 years of clinical science training with clinical science board exams after the fourth year. Each graduate of Naturopathic medical school has met rigorous clinical checkpoints for adequacy in practicing Naturopathic medicine as a primary care physician. Naturopathic physicians diagnose acute and chronic illness/imbalances/disease through history, physical exam, and laboratory tests. Treatment approach utilizes gentle therapies that stimulate the body's ability to recover and heal itself. Therapeutics include physical medicine, western and Chinese herbs, clinical nutrition, hydrotherapy, acupuncture, minor surgery and counseling.
