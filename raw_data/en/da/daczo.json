Community 4Baylor Scott & White Health mission Our commitment to the communities we serve As the largest not-for-profit healthcare system in T exas and one of the largest in the United States, Baylor Scott & White Health was born from the 2013 combination of Baylor Health Care System and Scott & White Healthcare. T oday, Baylor Scott & White includes 51 hospitals, 1,100 access points, more than 7,300 active physicians, and over 49,000 employees and the Baylor Scott & White Health Plan. Baylor Scott & White Health is a leading T exas healthcare provider with a proven commitment to patient and community health. Baylor Scott & White Health demonstrates this commitment through periodic community health needs assessments, then addresses those needs with a wide range of outreach initiatives. These Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) activities also satisfy federal and state community benefit requirements outlined in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the T exas Health and Safety Code. Baylor Scott & White Health conducts a thorough periodic examination of public health indicators and a benchmark analysis comparing communities it serves to an overall state of T exas value. In this way, it can determine where deficiencies lie and the opportunities for improvement are greatest. Through interviews, focus groups and surveys, the organization gains a clearer understanding of community needs from the perspective of the members of each community. This helps it identify the most pressing needs a community is facing and develop implementation plans to focus on those prioritized needs. The process includes input from a wide range of knowledgeable people who represent the myriad interests of the community in compliance with 501 (r)(3) regulations. The CHNA process overview can be found in Appendix A. The CHNAs serve as the foundation for community health improvement planning efforts over the next three years, while the implementation plans will be evaluated annually.Health Experience Affordability Alignment GrowthFounded as a Christian ministry of healing, Baylor Scott & White Health promotes the well-being of all individuals, families and communities.

The Brazos Valley is home to two of these hospitals with overlapping communities, including: Baylor Scott & White Medical Center - Brenham Baylor Scott & White Medical Center - College Station The community served by the hospital facilities listed above is Austin, Brazos, Burleson, Grimes, Robertson, Waller and Washington counties. BSWH has at least one hospital facility or a provider- based clinic in each of these counties, and together they comprise where more than 70% of the admitted patients live according to the hospital facilities' inpatient admissions over the 12-month period of FY20. Those facilities with overlapping counties of patient origin collaborated to provide a joint CHNA report in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code Section 501 (r) (3) and the US Treasury regulations thereunder. All of the collaborating hospital facilities included in this joint CHNA report define their communities to be the same for the purposes of the CHNA report.10 101010102020 20 2027 30 PasoDallas Austin Brazos Valley Health Community 6BSWH engaged with IBM Watson Health, a nationally respected consulting firm, to conduct a Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) in accordance with the federal and state community benefit requirements for the health communities they serve. Define the communityAssess the communityIdentify and prioritize \"significant needs\" The CHNA process included: Gathering and analyzing more than 59 public and 45 proprietary health data indicators to provide a comprehensive assessment of the health status of the communities. The complete list of health data indicators is included in Appendix B. Creating a benchmark analysis comparing the community to overall state of T exas and United States (US) values.

In addition, the focus group participants highlighted the high prevalence of chronic conditions in low-income patients who are at a disadvantage with limited resources and lack of knowledge on available resources. They also noted that lack of providers and information on available resources, along with the lack of insurance and lack of transportation prevent patients from receiving treatment and getting prescriptions filled. In the prioritization session, the hospital and community leaders agreed that some diabetes resources were lost due to COVID and that it is important that there is a refocus on diabetes and health education in the community. They added that there is an opportunity for the community to do a better job of educating our younger population on healthy lifestyle choices. Brazos Valley Health Community 12Priority 2: Access to Mental Healthcare (Providers/Resources) Category Data shows greater need Key informants indicate greater need Mental health Mentally unhealthy days Population to one mental health provider Many who need mental health services Limited access to mental health providers The following data indicates greater need in the area of mental health, specifically in the measures of mentally unhealthy days and population to one mental health provider. The mentally unhealthy days indicator is defined as \"average number of mentally unhealthy days reported in past 30 days (age-adjusted).\" The population to one mental health provider is defined as \"ratio of population to mental health providers.\" Both indicators are based on data from County Health Rankings & Roadmaps, The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), CMS and National Provider Identification Registry (NPPES).

Brazos Valley Health Community 13The focus group participants stated that the demand for mental health services outpaces the limited availability, and there is no inpatient psych facility in the area. There is a high demand but limited supply of mental/behavioral health and primary care providers leading to difficulty accessing much- needed care. They noted that there is a struggle to compete in terms of compensation to attract mental healthcare providers as a not-for-profit organization. In the prioritization session, hospital leadership also confirmed there are not enough mental health providers, such as psychiatrists and/or psychologists, to meet the needs of the community and that they cannot recruit and hire enough to serve the community's needs. In addition, they noted that mental health providers are lower compensated than other physician specialties, which makes it more difficult to recruit medical students to study psychiatry. In the Brazos Valley health community, inpatient and outpatient mental health services are very much lacking. Baylor Scott & White is looking at expanding the collaborative care model to mental health services. This model would have mid-level mental health providers (LPCs, LMSWs, etc.) partnering with primary care physicians to address mental health needs. Brazos Valley Health Community 14Priority 3: Access to Primary Care Category Data shows greater need Key informants indicate greater need Access to care Population to one primary care physician Limited access to primary healthcare providers The data below indicates greater need for population to one primary care physician. The indicator is defined as \"number of individuals served by one physician in a county, if the population was equally distributed across physicians\" and is based on data from County Health Rankings & Roadmaps and Area Health Resource File/American Medical Association.

The focus group participants stated the community is desperately lacking access to healthcare services across the board. They further stated that there is limited access to primary care specifically. In the prioritization session, hospital leadership prioritized access to primary care as the third-highest ranked need to be addressed. Brazos Valley Health Community 15Priority 4: Obesity Category Data shows greater need Key informants indicate greater need Conditions/ diseases Adult obesity Residents disadvantaged with chronic conditions such as obesity and diabetes The data below indicates greater need for adult obesity. The indicator is defined as \"percentage of the adult population (age 20 and older) that reports a body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 30 kg/m2\" and is based on data from County Health Rankings & Roadmaps, CDC Diabetes Interactive Atlas and The National Diabetes Surveillance System.

Indicators are ranked from 1 to 59, where low numbers show higher need and potentially larger vulnerable population relative to the state benchmark. Color and shape compare county performance to the state benchmark; orange diamonds show greater need and blue circles lesser need. The focus group participants stated that there are many residents disadvantaged with limited resources and chronic conditions including obesity. These patients also lack health knowledge and lack awareness of what resources are available to them. In the prioritization session, hospital leadership agreed that adult obesity is an issue and a driver to other health conditions in the community. Obesity and its related conditions drive up healthcare costs, including equipment, medication, increasing hospital days, etc., and therefore is an important need to prioritize. Brazos Valley Health Community 16Priority 5: Population Under 65 Without Health Insurance Category Data shows greater need Key informants indicate greater need Access to care Population under age 65 without health insurance Lack of health insurance The data below indicates greater need in the case of the indicator population under 65 without health insurance.

The focus group participants stated that lack of insurance is one of the factors that prevent patients from receiving treatment, seeking needed care and getting prescriptions filled, so their health worsens. In the prioritization session, hospital leadership prioritized access to health insurance as the fifth- ranked need to be addressed. Brazos Valley Health Community 17Priority 6: Transportation Category Data shows greater need Key informants indicate greater need Transportation No vehicle available Unaffordable transportation options/ high cost of owning vehicle The data below indicates greater need in the case of the indicator environment: no vehicle available.

Color and shape compare county performance to the state benchmark; orange diamonds show greater need and blue circles lesser need. The focus group participants stated that there is limited public transportation throughout the community. Transportation is especially an issue for the outer regions. Even with gas vouchers, affordability is an issue. Fortunately, there is some support in the community to improve transportation gaps that will help with some of the access issues, but those efforts need to be expanded to offer services to other vulnerable populations. In the prioritization session, hospital leadership prioritized transportation as the sixth-ranked need to be addressed. They cited that transportation is more of an issue for rural communities. Rural residents cannot access physician visits and other care appointments to treat their conditions.

The resulting Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) report must include descriptions of the following: The community served and how the community was determined; The process and methods used to conduct the assessment, including sources and dates of the data and other information as well as the analytical methods applied to identify significant community health needs; How the organization used input from persons representing the broad interests of the community served by the hospital, including a description of when and how the hospital consulted with these persons or the organizations they represent; The prioritized significant health needs identified through the CHNA as well as a description of the process and criteria used in prioritizing the identified significant needs; The existing healthcare facilities, organizations and other resources within the community available to meet the significant community health needs; and An evaluation of the impact of any actions that were taken since the hospitals' most recent CHNA to address the significant health needs identified in that report. \u00b0 Hospitals also must adopt an implementation strategy to address prioritized community health needs identified through the assessment. CHNA process BSWH began the 2022 CHNA process in April of 2021. The following is an overview of the timeline and major milestones: Define the community Assess the community Identify \"significant needs\" and \"prioritize\" Document in written report CHNA board approvals Make CHNA widely available on website Written implementation strategy Implementation strategy board approval Make implementation strategy widely available on website Act on strategy, measure and report Brazos Valley Health Community 21Consultant qualifications IBM Watson Health delivers analytic tools, benchmarks and strategic consulting services to the healthcare industry, combining rich data analytics in demographics, including the Community Needs Index, planning and disease prevalence estimates, with experienced strategic consultants to deliver comprehensive and actionable Community Health Needs Assessments. Health needs assessment process overview T o identify the health needs of the community, the hospitals established a comprehensive method using all available relevant data including community input. They used the qualitative and quantitative data obtained when assessing the community to identify its community health needs. Surveyors conducted interviews and focus groups with individuals representing public health, community leaders/groups, public organizations and other providers. In addition, data collected from public sources compared to the state benchmark indicated the level of severity. The outcomes of the quantitative data analysis were compared to the qualitative data findings. These data are available to the community via an interactive dashboard at BSWHealth.com/ CommunityNeeds. Data gathering: quantitative assessment of health needs - methodology and data sources The IBM team used quantitative data collection and analysis garnered from public health indicators to assess community health needs. This included over 100 data elements grouped into over 11 categories evaluated for the counties where data was available. Recently, indicators expanded to include new categories addressing mental health, healthcare costs, opioids and social determinants of health. A table depicting the categories and indicators and a list of sources are in Appendix B. A benchmark analysis of each indicator determined which public health indicators demonstrated a community health need. Benchmark health indicators included overall US values, state of T exas values and other goal-setting benchmarks, such as Healthy People 2020. According to America's Health Rankings 2021 Annual Report, T exas ranks 22nd out of the 50 states in the area of Health Outcomes (which includes behavioral health, mortality and physical health) and 50th in the area of Clinical Care (which includes avoiding care due to cost, providers per 100,000 population and preventive services). When the health status of T exas was compared to other states, the team identified many opportunities to impact community health. Brazos Valley Health Community 22The quantitative analysis of the health community used the following methodology: The team set benchmarks for each health community using state value for comparison. They identified community indicators not meeting state benchmarks. From this, they determined a need differential analysis of the indicators, which helped them understand the community's relative severity of need. Using the need differentials, they established a standardized way to evaluate the degree that each indicator differed from its benchmark. This quantitative analysis showed which health community indicators were above the 25th percentile in order of severity\u2014and which health indicators needed their focus. The outcomes of the quantitative data analysis were compared to the qualitative data findings. Information gaps In some areas of T exas, the small population size has an impact on reporting and statistical significance. The team has attempted to understand the most significant health needs of the entire community. It is understood that there is variation of need within the community, and BSWH may not be able to impact all of the population who truly need the service. Community input: qualitative health needs assessment - approach T o obtain a qualitative assessment of the health community, the team: Assembled a focus group representing the broad interests of the community served; Conducted interviews and surveys with key informants\u2014leaders and representatives who serve the community and have insight into its needs; and Held prioritization sessions with hospital clinical leadership and community leaders to review collection results and identify the most significant healthcare needs based on information gleaned from the focus groups and key informants. Focus groups helped identify barriers and social factors influencing the community's health needs. Key informant interviews gave the team even more understanding and insight about the general health status of the community and the various drivers that contributed to health issues. Multiple governmental public health department individuals were asked to contribute their knowledge, information and expertise relevant to the health needs of the community. Individuals or organizations who served and/or represented the interests of medically underserved, low-income and minority populations in the community also took part in the process. NOTE: In some cases, public health officials were unavailable due to obligations concerning the COVID-19 pandemic. The hospitals also considered written input received on their most recently conducted CHNA and subsequent implementation strategies if provided. The assessment is available for public comment or feedback on the report findings by going to the BSWH website (BSWHealth.com/CommunityNeeds) or by emailing CommunityHealth@BSWHealth.org. Brazos Valley Health Community 23Approach to identifying significant health needs On January 13, 2022, a session was held with key leadership members from Baylor Scott & White Medical Center - Brenham and Baylor Scott & White Medical Center - College Station along with community leaders to review the qualitative and quantitative data findings of the CHNA to date, discuss at length the significant needs identified, and complete prioritization exercises to rank the community needs. Prioritizing health needs was a two-step process. The two-step process allowed participants to consider the quantitative needs and qualitative needs as defined by the indicator dataset and focus group/interview/survey participant input. In the first step, participants reviewed the top health needs for their community using associated data-driven criteria. The criteria included health indicator value(s) for the community and how the indicator compared to the state benchmark. High data/ Low qualitativeHigh data/ High qualitative TIVE QUALIT A TIVEDATAHigh data and high qualitative: The community indicators that showed a greater need in the health community overall when compared to the state of T exas comparative benchmark and were identified as a greater need by the key informants. High data/ Low qualitativeHigh data/ High qualitative TIVE QUALIT A TIVEDATAHigh data and low qualitative: The community indicators showed a greater need in the health community overall when compared to the state of T exas comparative benchmark but were not identified as a greater need or not specifically identified by the key informants. High data/ Low qualitativeHigh data/ High qualitative TIVE QUALIT A TIVEDATALow/no data and high qualitative: The community indicators showed less need or had no data available in the health community overall when compared to the state of T exas comparative benchmark but were identified as a greater need by the key informants. Participants held a group discussion about which needs were most significant, using the professional experience and community knowledge of the group. A virtual voting method was invoked for individuals to provide independent opinions. This process helped the group define and identify the community's significant health needs. Participants voted individually for the needs they considered the most significant for this community. When the votes were tallied, the top identified needs emerged and were ranked based on the number of votes. High data/Low qualitative High data/High qualitative Data compared to state benchmark indicates need by a greater magnitude BUT T opic was not raised in interviews and focus groupsData compared to state benchmark indicates need by a greater magnitude AND T opic was a frequent theme in interviews and focus groups Data compared to state benchmark indicates need by a lesser magnitude AND T opic was not raised in interviews and focus groupsData compared to state benchmark indicates need by a lesser magnitude BUT T opic was a frequent theme in interviews and focus groups Low data/Low qualitative Low/no data/High qualitative High data = Indicators worse than state benchmark by greater magnitude High qualitative = Frequency of topic in interviews and focus groupsQualitative QualitativeData Data Brazos Valley Health Community 24Prioritization of significant needs In the second step, participants ranked the significant health needs based on prioritization criteria recommended by the focus group conducted for this community: Severity (outcome if ignored): What degree of disability or premature death occurs because of the problem? What are the potential burdens to the community, such as economic or social burdens? Magnitude (size of problem): How many persons does the problem affect, either actually or potentially? Feasibility/cost: Is the problem amenable to interventions? What technology, knowledge, or resources are necessary to effect a change? Is the problem preventable? Is it too expensive for the community to tackle? The group rated each of the significant health needs on each of the three identified criteria, using a scale of 1 (low) to 10 (high). The criteria score sums for each need created an overall score. They prioritized the list of significant health needs based on the overall scores. The outcome of this process was the list of prioritized health needs for this community. Priority Need Category of need 1 Chronic disease management/education Conditions/diseases 2 Access to mental healthcare (providers/resources) Mental health 3 Access to primary care Access to care 4 Obesity Conditions/diseases 5 Population under 65 without health insurance Access to care 6 Transportation Transportation Brazos Valley Health Community 25Appendix B: key public health indicators IBM Watson Health collected and analyzed fifty-nine (59) public health indicators to assess and evaluate community health needs. For each health indicator, a comparison between the most recently available community data and benchmarks for the same/similar indicator was made.

The CNI takes into account vital socio- economic factors, including income, culture, education, insurance and housing, about a community to generate a CNI score for every population ZIP code in the US. The CNI is strongly linked to variations in community healthcare needs and is a good indicator of a community's demand for a range of healthcare services. Not-for-profit and community-based hospitals, for whom community need is central to the mission of service, are often challenged to prioritize and effectively distribute hospital resources. The CNI can be used to help them identify specific initiatives best designed to address the health disparities of a given community. The CNI score by ZIP code shows specific areas within a community where healthcare needs may be greater. Brazos Valley Health Community The overall CNI score for the Brazos Valley Health Community was 4.17. The difference in the numbers indicates both a strong link to community healthcare needs and a community's demand for various healthcare services. In portions of the community, the CNI score was greater than 4.5, indicating more significant health needs among the population.

Social determinants of health are the structural determinants and conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age. All of which can greatly impact healthcare utilization and play a major role in the shifting healthcare landscape. Social determinants, such as education, income and race, are factored into Inpatient Demand Estimates and Outpatient Procedure Estimates utilization rate creation methodologies. Inpatient demand estimates Inpatient demand estimates provide the total volume of annual acute care admissions by ZIP code and DRG Product Line for every market in the United States. IBM uses all-payor state discharge data for publicly available states and Medicare (MEDPAR) data for the entire US. These rates are applied to demographic projections by ZIP code to estimate inpatient utilization for 2020 through 2030. The following summary is reflective of the inpatient utilization trends for Brazos Valley Health Community. T otal discharges in the community are expected to grow by 6.5% by 2030, with General Medicine, Pulmonary Medical and Cardiovascular Diseases projecting the largest growth.

IBM uses an extensive supply of proprietary claims, public claims and federal surveys to construct population-based use rates for all payors by age and sex. These use rates are then applied to demographic and insurance coverage projections by ZIP code to estimate ED utilization for 2020 through 2030. Visits are broken out into emergent and non-emergent ambulatory visits to identify the volume of visits that could be seen in a less-acute setting, for example, a fast-track ED or an urgent care facility. In addition, visits that result in an inpatient admission are broken out into a third, separate category. In the Brazos Valley Health Community, ED visits are expected to grow by over 15% by 2025.

IBM uses public and private claims data as well as epidemiological data from the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES) to build local estimates of heart disease prevalence for the current population. County-level models by age and sex are applied to the underlying demographics of specific geographies to estimate the number of patients with specific types of heart disease. In Brazos Valley Health Community, the most common disease is hypertension at 70% of all heart disease cases.Disease type 2020 prevalence 2020 % prevalence Arrhythmia 100.0% Source: IBM Watson Heart Disease Estimates, 2020.
