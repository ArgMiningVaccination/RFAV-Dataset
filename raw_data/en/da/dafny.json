Issued: Wednesday, 26 April 2023, London, U.K. Press release First quarter 2023 2 Research and development ESG Total and Adjusted results Financial information Audit or's review report Results Summary 2023 guidance The Company affirms its full -year 2023 guidance at constant exchange rates (CER). All expectations and full -year growth rates exclude any contributions from COVID -19 solutions: Turnover is expected to increase between 6 to 8 per cent Adjusted operating profit is expected to increase between 10 to 12 per cent Adjusted earnings per share is expected to increase between 12 to 15 per cent Taking Q1 2023 performance and the latest expectations for Q2 2023 into account, GSK now expects first half and second half turnover growth to be broadly similar and for General Medicines to be broadly flat to slightly down this year. GSK expects Adjusted operating profit growth to be lower in the first half of 2023 and higher in the second half, relative to full -year expectations. Despite the recovery of healthcare systems, uncertain economic conditions prevail across many markets in which GSK op erates and we continue to expect to see variability in performance between quarters. This guidance is supported by the following turnover expectations for full year 2023 at CER: Vaccines - expected increase of mid -teens per cent in turnover Specialty Medicines - expected increase of mid to high single -digit per cent in turnover General Medicines - expected to be broadly flat to slightly down Adjusted Operating profit is expected to grow between 10 to 12 per cent at CER reflecting Cost of sal es and R&D increasing at a rate slightly below turnover, while SG&A is anticipated to increase at a rate broadly aligned to turnover, reflecting targeted support for launches and potential launches including the RSV older adult candidate vaccine. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to increase between 12 to 15 per cent at CER reflecting favourable net finance costs and non -controlling interests plus an expected lower tax rate, at around 15%. Additional commentary Dividend policies and expected pay -out ratios remain unchanged for GSK. The future dividend policies and guidance regarding the expected dividend pay -out in 2023 for GSK are provided on page 30. COVID -19 solutions In Q1 2023, turnover decreased by 8% at CER reflecting the comparison to Q1 2022, which included \u00a31,307 million of COVID -19 solutions sales in the period. Excluding COVID -19 solutions, turnover increased by 10% at CER. In Q1 2023, Adjusted Operating profit was stable at CER reflecting a 5% adverse impact from expected lower COVID - 19 solutions sales. Based on known binding agreements with governments, GSK does not anticipate further significant COVID -19 pandemic -related sales or operating profit in 2023. Con sequently, the Company now expects full-year 2023 turnover growth to be impacted by approximately 9%, with Adjusted Operating profit growth being reduced between 5% to 6% versus the prior year. All expectations, guidance and targets regarding future perfo rmance and dividend payments should be read together with 'Guidance, assumptions and cautionary statements' on pages 45 and 46. If exchange rates were to hold at the closing rates on 31 March 2023 ($1.24/\u00a31, \u20ac1.14/\u00a31 and Yen 165/\u00a31) for the rest of 2023, t he estimated impact on 2023 Sterling turnover growth for GSK would be stable and if exchange gains or losses were recognised at the same level as in 2022, the estimated impact on 2023 Sterling Adjusted Operating Profit growth for GSK would be -1%.

Key growth drivers were geographical expansion and market growth for Shingrix , and inclusion in National Immuni sation Program mes for Bexsero . Pandemic vaccines sales reflected GSK's share of 2023 contracted European volumes related to a COVID -19 booster vaccine co -developed with against herpes zoster (shingles), grew in International and Europe reflecting new launch uptake, demand and favourable pricing mix. US sales were primarily impacted by unfavo urable wholesaler and distributor inventory movements. Shingrix is now available in 31 countries. Meningitis Q1 23 280 32% 25% Strong growth in Meningitis vaccines was primarily driven by Bexsero , our vaccine against meningitis B, which grew in Europe mainly from inclusion in National Immunisation Programmes and in International due to an increase in demand ahead of an anticipated price increase. Menveo , our vaccine against meningitis strains ACWY , grew in the US primarily due to initial public stocking of the new liquid formulation and Center for Disease Control ( CDC) purchasing patterns. Established Vaccines Q1 23 815 10% 4% Established Vaccines grew mainly in Hepatitis vaccines resulting from continued travel market recovery in Europe and International, and due to CDC purchasing patterns in the US. Rotarix , a vaccine to protect infants against rotavirus, grew in the US primarily driven by initial stocking of the new liquid formulation by the CDC. Synflorix , our 10-valent vaccine for pneumococcal disease, declined in the quarter reflecting phasing of public market supply and lower demand related to d ecreased birth cohorts in International. Issued: Wednesday, 26 April 2023, London, U.K. Press release First quarter 2023 4 Research and development ESG Total and Adjusted results Financial information Audit or's review report Results Summary \u00a3m AER CER Specialty Medicines Total Q1 23 2,236 2,205 21% 13% Specialty Medicines growth consistent performance, with HIV, Oncology and Immuno logy/R espiratory and Other all growing. In the quarter, there were minimal sales of Xevudy contrasting with strong sales in Q1 2022, resulting in a drag of 46 (CER) percentage points. HIV Q1 23 1,468 24% 15% The performance of HIV benefited from strong patient demand for Oral two-drug regimen (Oral 2DR) and Long Acting medicines which contributed approximately two-thirds of the growth. US pricing favourability contributed approximately one -third of growth, in part driven by favourable prior period Returns and Rebates ( RAR ) adjustments in Q1 2023. The inventory build in Q4 2022 has been slow to deplete , with less than one-third reducing i n this quarter , the remainder is expected to reduce by the half year. Oral 2DR and Long Acting ) sales represent ed 47% of HIV portfolio compared to 36% in Q1 2022 . Growth was primarily Cabenuva . therapy area includes sales of Benlysta and Nucala , and also sales of Duvroq (Daprodustat ) in Japan . Daprodustat launch in US is expected in the second half of the year. Benlysta Q1 23 253 18% 9% Benlysta , a monoclonal antibody treatment for Lupus, continues to show consistent growth representing strong underlying demand in US and Europe . This growth was partially offset in the quarter by the impact of wholesaler inventory movements in US and International regions. Nucala Q1 23 347 -5 antagonist monoclonal antibody treatment for severe asthma, with additional indications including chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) and hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) . Growth in the quarter reflect ed patient demand in severe eosinophilic asthma and for the new indications with ongoing launches. This growth was partially offset in the US by the impact of inventory depletion and an unfavourable prior period RAR adjustment. Oncology Q1 23 136 7% 2% Oncology growth was driven by Zejula in Europe and Jemperli in US and Europe. Blenrep growth in Europe was offset by the impact of withdrawal from the US market in November 2022. Zejula Q1 23 a PARP inhibitor treatment for ovarian cancer, was driven by Europe and International markets. In the US, first line indication growth was more than offset by reduction in use in second line following the update to US prescribing information agreed with the FDA in Q4 2022.

Respiratory Q1 23 1,767 15% 10% Performance reflects strong growth of Trelegy and the single inhaled triple therapy class across all regions. Growth also includes the benefits of a strong allergy season in Japan and the US launch of Flovent authorised generic in Q2 2022. Favourable US prior period RAR adjustments to Seretide/Advair were offset by adverse adjustments to Relvar/Breo in the quarter. Trelegy Q1 23 465 37% 28% Trelegy , is the prescribed single inhaler triple therapy (SITT) treatment for COPD and asthma. Trelegy grew in the period with strong performance across all regions, reflecting increased patient demand and growth of the SITT market. Seretide/Advair Q1 23 339 12% 8% treatment for asthma and COPD . Growth reflected targeted promotion in certain International markets and the benefit of a favourable US prior period RAR adjustment, partially offset by the impact of generic competition in Europe, US and certain International markets. Other General Medicines Q1 23 907 7% 7% High single -digit growth reflected strong post pandemic demand for anti -infectives in Europe and International, with Augmentin growth of 37% AER, 38% CER in the quarter. The impact of ongoing generic competition in this product group is also offset by Avodart and dermatological product growth, predominantly in the International region. By Region \u00a3m AER CER US Total Q1 23 3,270 3,270 16% 6% In the quarter there was a 23 (CER) percentage point drag due to high sales of Xevudy in Q1 2022, with no COVID -19 solutions sales in Q1 2023. Excluding this effect there was growth in all product groups. Vaccines grew on Established Vaccine market recover y and CDC order phasing, offsetting impact of wholesaler destocking and a strong Q1 2022 comparator on Shingrix growth. Specialty Medicines growth was driven by strong HIV performance. General Medicines growth was driven by ongoing performance of Trelegy within the single inhaled triple therapy class. \u00a3m AER CER Europe Total Q1 23 1,704 3% COVID -19 solutions Q1 23 1,603 19% 14% In the quarter there was a 16 (CER) percentage point drag due to high sales of Xevudy in Q1 2022, with all product groups growing strongly excluding this effect. Vaccines double digit growth reflected Shingrix launches and uptake, Bexsero national immunisa tion campaigns in France and Spain and ongoing travel vaccine recovery. Specialty Medicines double digit growth was driven by HIV, Benlysta and Nucala including the impact of new indication launches. General Medicines was driven by Trelegy ongoing growth a nd Augmentin on strong post pandemic antibiotic demand . \u00a3m AER CER International Total Q1 23 1,977 COVID -19 solutions Q1 23 1,946 13% 14% In the quarter there was a 1 2 (CER) percentage point drag due to high sales of Xevudy in Q1 2022, with all product groups growing strongly excluding this effect.

This was partly offset by an unfavourable comparator to a one-time benefit from inventory adjustments in Q 1 2022 as well as higher freight costs. Q1 2023 \u00a3m AER CER Selling, general & administration Total 2,143 18% 4.9% Growth in Total and Adjusted SG&A primarily reflected an increase in legal provisions primarily relating to the Zejula royalty dispute(1) resulting in an increase of 4 ppts and an increased level of launch investment in Specialty Medicines particularly HIV and Vaccines including Shingrix to drive post -pandemic recovery demand and support market expansion. Growth was partly offset by favourable comparison due to impairment provisi ons relating to Russia and Ukraine in Q1 2022 and the continuing benefit of restructuring and tight control of ongoing costs . Q1 2023 \u00a3m AER CER Research & development 2.4% 2.4% Growth in Total and Adjusted R&D reflected increased investment across the Vaccines clinical development portfolio, particularly in pneumococcal programmes acquired as part of the Affinivax Inc (Affinivax) acquisition, mRNA technology platforms and the phase II MMR programme . In the Specialty Medicines portfolio , there was increased investment in the early stage research portfolio, particularly CCL17 for osteo arthritic pain and IL 18 for atopic dermatitis and in Jemperli , with preparation for new phase II/III trials in rectal and colon cancer as well as the ongoing trials in endometrial cancer. In addition, there was increased investment in momelotinib, a potential new treatment of myelofibrosis patients with anaemia, the phase III respiratory programme for depemokimab, a potential new medicine to treat a range of eosinophil -driven diseases and for bepirovirsen, the study in chronic hepatitis B. These increases in investment were par tly offset by decreases related to the completion of late -stage clinical development program mes for otilimab and Cell & Gene therapy and reduced R&D investment in Blenrep versus Q1 2022. Q1 2023 \u00a3m AER CER Total 180 30% 28% Adjusted 180 30% 28% Growth in Total and Adjusted royalty income primarily reflect ed the settlement and licensing agreement with Gilead Sciences Inc.

Net other operating income included an accounting credit of \u00a3271 million (Q1 2022: \u00a3335 million charge ) arising from the remeasurement of contingent consideration liabilities and the liabilities for the Pfizer, Inc. (Pfizer) put option and Pfizer and Shionogi & Co. Ltd (Shionogi) preferential dividends in ViiV Healthcare. Q1 2023 \u00a3m AER CER Operating profit sales 30.0% % of sales 30.1% 3.1% 2.5% Total operating profit margin was down 1.9 ppts at AER and 2.4 ppts at CER primarily reflecting an unfavourable comparison due to the \u00a30.9 billion upfront income received from the settlement with Gilead in Q1 2022, partly offset by remeasurement credits on contingent consideration liabilities. Adjusted profit was impacted by lower sales o f COVID -19 solutions sales which led to a drag of 5% AER and CER but increased the Adjusted operating profit margin by approximately 3.9 ppts at AER and CER. Excluding COVID - 19 Solutions , Adjusted operating profit benefited from strong sales across all thr ee product areas but margin was impacted by increased legal charges in the quarter primarily relating to the Zejula royalty dispute and an unfavourable comparison to a one-time benefit from inventory adjustments in Q 1 2022. Contingent consideration cash payments made to Shionogi and other companies reduce the balance sheet liability . Total contingent consideration cash payments in Q1 2023 amounted to \u00a3 291 million (Q1 2 022: \u00a3211 million). These included cash payments made to Shionogi of \u00a3 287 million (Q1 2022: \u00a3208 million). Q1 2023 \u00a3m AER CER Adjusted operating profit by business Commercial Operations 3,375 8% 1% 13% 6% Commercial Operations Adjusted operating profit reflected lower COVID -19 solution s sales, primarily Xevudy . Sales declined 8% with 19 ppts AER / 18 ppts CER drag from COVID -19 solution s sales. Operating profit margin benefitted from product mix upside (with minimal Xevudy sales) and increased royalty income, partly offset by increased investment in growth and launch assets as well as an increase in legal provisions . The R&D segment operating expenses primarily reflected increased investment in the Vaccines clinical development portfolio, particularly in pneumococcal programmes, the mRNA technology platforms and the phase II MMR programme. This was partly offset by decreases related to the completion of late-stage clinical development program mes for otilimab and Cell & Gene therapy and reduced R&D investment in Blenrep versus Q1 2022 . Q1 2023 \u00a3m AER CER Total 174 (12%) (16%) Adjusted 170 (14%) (18%) Total net finance costs decreased by \u00a324 million compared to Q1 2022. Adjusted net finance costs decreased by \u00a328 million compared to Q1 2022 . The decrease is mainly driven by the net savings from maturing bonds including the Sterling Notes repurchase in Q 4 2022 and higher interest income on cash. Issued: Wednesday, 26 April 2023, London, U.K. Press release First quarter 2023 9 Research and development ESG Total and Adjusted results Financial information Audit or's review report Results Summary Q1 2023 \u00a3m AER CER Taxation Total 276 (15%) (21%) Tax rate % 14.5% Adjusted 303 6% (2%) Tax rate % 15.8% The effective tax rate impact is broadly in line with expectations for the quarter. Issues related to taxation are described in Note 14, 'Taxation' in the Annual Report 2022. The Group continues to believe it has made adequate provision for the liabilities likely to arise from periods that are open and not yet agreed by relevant tax authorities. The ultimate liability for such matters may vary from the amounts provided and is dependent upon the outcome of agreements with relevant tax authorities. Q1 2023 \u00a3m AER CER Non-controlling interests Total 141 (49%) (53%) Adjusted 121 (25%) (32%) The decrease in Total profit from continuing operations allocated to non -controlling interest was primarily due to lower allocation of ViiV Healthcare profits of \u00a3 140 million (Q1 2022: \u00a3 227 million), partly offset by decreased credits for remeasurement of contingent consideration liabilities, as well as lower net profits in some of the Group's other entities with non -controlling interests. The decrease in Adjusted profit from continuing ope rations allocated to non -controlling interest primarily reflected lower profits in some of the Group's entities with non -controlling interests partly offset by an increased allocation of ViiV Healthcare profits of \u00a3 120 million (Q1 2022: \u00a3 113 million ). Q1 (1%) (8%) Adjusted 37.0p 15% 7% The decrease in Total EPS primarily reflected an unfavourable comparison due to upfront income received from the settlement with Gilead in Q1 2022. This was partly offset by remeasurement credits for contingent consideration liabilities compared to charges in Q1 2022, lower non -controlling interests and lower effective tax rate. Adjusted EPS reflected strong growth in sales across all product areas excluding COVID -19 solutions, higher royalty income, lower non -controlling interests and a lower effective tax rate. This was partly offset by increased legal charges primarily relating to royalties and investment behind launches in Specialty Medicines including HIV and Vaccines plus higher supply chain costs, freight and distribution costs. Decline in lower margin COVID -19 solutions sales was a drag on Adjusted EPS growth of 7 ppts at A ER and CER. Currency impact on Q1 2023 results The results for Q1 2023 are based on average exchange rates, principally \u00a31/$1.22, \u00a31/\u20ac1.14 and \u00a31/Yen 162. Comparative exchange rates are given on page 31. The period -end exchange rates were \u00a31/$1.24, \u00a31/\u20ac1.14 and \u00a31/Yen 165. In Q1 2023, turnover was down 3% at AER and 8% at CER. Total EPS from continuing operations was 36.8p compared with 37. 3p in Q1 2022. Adjusted EPS was 37.0 p compared with 32.3p in Q1 2022, up 15% at AER and 7% at CER . The favourable currency impact primarily reflected the weakening of Sterling against the US Dollar and the Euro.

Q1 2023 Cash generated from operating activities from continuing operations was \u00a3287 million (Q1 2022: \u00a32,352 million). The decrease primarily reflected an unfavourable comparison due to the upfront income from the settlement with Gilead received in Q1 2022, unfav ourable timing of profit share payments for Xevudy , increase in seasonal inventory and lower payable balances reflecting increased investment in 2022. Total cash payments to Shionogi in relation to the ViiV Healthcare contingent consideration liability in the quarter were \u00a3287 million (Q1 2022: \u00a3208 million), all of which was recognised in cash flows from operating activities. These payments are deductible for tax purposes. Free cash ou tflow was \u00a3 689 million for the quarter (Q1 2022: \u00a31,477 million inflo w). The decrease primarily reflected an unfavourable comparison due to the upfront income from the settlement with Gilead received in Q1 2022, unfavourable timing of profit share payments for Xevudy , increase in seasonal inventory, lower payable balances reflecting increased investment in 2022 and higher tax payments . Total Net debt At 31 March 2023, net debt was \u00a317,95 0 million, compared with \u00a317,197 million at 31 December 2022, comprising gross debt of \u00a3 20,905 million and cash and liquid investments of \u00a3 2,955 million. Net debt increased by \u00a30.8 billion primarily due to \u00a30. 7 billion free cash outflow and dividends paid to shareholders of \u00a30.6 billion. This was partly offset by net favourable exchange impacts of \u00a30.4 billion from the translation of non - Sterling denominated debt and exchange on other financing items and \u00a30.1 billion of income received from equity investme nts. At 31 March 2023, GSK had short -term borrowings (including overdrafts and lease liabilities) repayable within 12 months of \u00a3 4,261 million with loans of \u00a3 1,682 million repayable in the subsequent year .

Issued: Wednesday, 26 April 2023, London, U.K. Press release First quarter 2023 13 Research and development ESG Total and Adjusted results Financial information Audit or's review report Results Summary Trust: progress on our six priority areas for responsible business Building Trust by operating responsibly is integral to GSK's strategy and culture. This will support growth and returns to shareholders, reduce risk, and help GSK's people thrive while delivering sustainable health impact at scale. The Company has identified six Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) focus areas that addres s what is most material to GSK's business and the issues that matter the most to its stakeholders. Highlights below include activity since Full -year and Q4 2022 results. For a full list of progress in 2022, please see the 2022 ESG Performance Report at: https://gsk.to/3V1hwFk . Access Commitment: to make GSK's vaccines and medicines available at value -based prices that are sustainable for the business and implement access strategies that increase the use of GSK's vaccines and medicines to treat and protect underserved people. Progress to date : GSK continues to collaborate to support access to its HIV portfolio. For example, following the signing of a voluntary licensing agreement for cabotegravir for HIV pre -exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) between ViiV Healthcare and the Medicines Patent Pool (MPP) in July 2022, the MPP signed subsequent sub -licence agreements in March 2023 with Aurobi ndo Pharma Limited, Cipla, Inc. and Viatris, Inc. - through its subsidiary Mylan - to manufacture generic versions of cabotegravir long -acting for PrEP. More information can be found at: https://gsk.to/3LsG72L Working with GSK's partners, more than 1.2 million children in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi have received at least one dose of the Company's malaria vaccine, Mosquirix (RTS,S/AS01 E). In March 2023, Kenya expanded vaccine use beyond the communities involved in the Malaria Vaccine Immunisation Programme (MVIP), almost doubling the number of areas where children can access it. All three countries that were part of the MVIP have now expanded the rollout. Global health and health security Commitment: develop novel products and technologies to treat and prevent priority diseases, including pandemic threats. Progress to date : GSK remains committed to innovation across medicines and vaccines to help get ahead of antimicrobial resistance, with a number of R&D projects targeting pathogens deemed 'critical' or 'urgent' by the WHO and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. G SK reinforced its commitment to developing new antibiotics in high unmet medical need areas when it presented positive results from the pivotal EAGLE -2 and EAGLE -3 phase III trials for gepotidacin, an investigational, first -in-class oral antibiotic with a novel mechanism of action for uncomplicated urinary tract infections (uUTI) in female adults and adolescents. Escherichia coli (e. coli) bacteria are the main cause of uUTI but it is showing increasing resistance to antibiotics currently used(1). The data were disclosed in an oral presentation at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ECCMID) in Copenhagen, Denmark. More information can be found at: https://gsk.to/40yA5lq . GSK continued to expand its industry -leading infectious diseases portfolio. In March 2023, the Company entered an exclusive licence agreement for Brexafemme (ibrexafungerp tablets), a US FDA -approved, first -in-class antifungal for treating vulvovaginal can didiasis and for a reduction in the incidence of recurrent VVC. Brexafemme complements GSK's late -stage antibiotics gepotidacin, and tebipenem, a potential new treatment for complicated urinary tract infections. With rates of multi -drug resistant fungal in fections rising, this agreement strengthens the Company's position as an innovation leader in antimicrobial resistance. More information can be found at: https://gsk.to/3oHAlkx Environment Commitment: committed to a net zero, nature -positive, healthier planet with ambitious goals set for 2030 and 2045. Progress to date : The Company has clear and measurable targets to achieve its climate and nature goals and shared its annual progress as part of G SK's ESG Performance Report . The Company also published more detail on its carbon reduction pathway and use of carbon credits, which can be found at: https://gsk.to/3LtovDT . The Taskforce on Nature -related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) recently released its final beta framework for nature - related risk management and disclosure. GSK sits on the Taskforce, and to pilot the recommendations ahead of the final framework expected later this year, the Company made an initial disclosure, focusin g on strategy, metrics and targets in its 2022 Annual Report (page 62). In addition, GSK was included in the TNFD (section 3.1) scenario guidance as an example of a multinational company taking an adv anced approach. Diversity, equity and inclusion Commitment: create a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace; enhance recruitment of diverse patient populations in GSK clinical trials; and support diverse communities. Progress to date : Appropriate clinical research representation is critical for advancing the Company's understanding of new vaccines and medicines to ensure they positively impact patients' lives. GSK announced results from a 17 -year retrospective study on US clinical trial diversity in February 2023. Results of the study demonstrate real -world disease epidemiology Issued: Wednesday, 26 April 2023, London, U.K. Press release First quarter 2023 14 Research and development ESG Total and Adjusted results Financial information Audit or's review report Results Summary data, compared to the conventional standard of US Census data, is a better benchmark to ensure clinical trial enrolment reflects the populations affected by disea ses. GSK has committed to applying insights from the study and collaborating with regulators, patients, academics, and other biopharmaceutical companies to make meaningful progress on clinical trial diversity. As a result, 100% of phase III trials now incl ude a demographic plan. More information can be found at: https://gsk.to/40IAGkE . GSK is committed to equality of representation so that its workforce reflects the communities in which it operates and hires, and that GSK leadership reflects the Company's workforce. In February 2023, GSK communicated its 2022 progress which was also highlighted in the ESG Performance Report: - Women held 42% of Vice President (VP) and above roles globally, compared with 40% in 2021, bringing the Company closer to its 2025 aspirational target of 45%; Women made up 47% of all employees in 2022 and 50% of all management roles. - In the US, GSK has 31.3% of ethnically diverse leaders at the VP level and ab ove and has met its 2025 aspirational target of at least 30%. - In the UK, the Company has 14.3% of ethnically diverse leaders at VP and above, progressing towards its 2025 aspirational target of reaching at least 18%. Ethical standards Commitment: promote ethical behaviour across GSK's business by supporting its employees to do the right thing and working with suppliers that share the Company's standards and operate responsibly. Performance metrics related to ethical standards are updated annually with details from the most recent year on page 26 of GSK's ESG Performance Report 2022. Product governance Commitment: maintain robust quality and safety processes and responsibly use data and new technologies. Performance metrics related to product governance are updated annually with details from the most recent year on page 30 of GSK's ESG Performance Report 2022.

GSK also uses a number of adjusted, non -IFRS, measures to report the performance of its business. Adjusted results and other non -IFRS measures may be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, information presented in accordance with IFRS. Adjusted results are defined below and other non -IFRS measures are defined on page 44. GSK believes that Adjusted results, when considered together with Total results, provide investors, analysts and other stakeholders with helpf ul complementary information to understand better the financial performance and position of the Group from period to period, and allow the Group's performance to be more easily compared against the majority of its peer companies. These measures are also us ed by management for planning and reporting purposes. They may not be directly comparable with similarly described measures used by other companies. GSK encourages investors and analysts not to rely on any single financial measure but to review GSK's qua rterly results announcements, including the financial statements and notes, in their entirety. GSK is committed to continuously improving its financial reporting, in line with evolving regulatory requirements and best practice. In line with this practice, GSK expects to continue to review and refine its reporting framework. Adjusted results exclude the profits from discontinued operations from the Consumer Healthcare business (see details on page 33) and the following items in relation to our continuing o perations from Total results, together with the tax effects of all of these items: amortisation of intangible assets (excluding computer software and capitalised development costs) impairment of intangible assets (excluding computer software) and goodwill major restructuring costs, which include impairments of tangible assets and computer software, (under specific Board approved programmes that are structural, of a significant scale and where the costs of individual or related projects exceed \u00a325 million), including integration costs following material acquisitions transaction -related accounting or other adjustments related to significant acquisitions proceeds and costs of disposal of associates, products and businesses; signi ficant settlement income; significant legal charges (net of insurance recoveries) and expenses on the settlement of litigation and government investigations; other operating income other than royalty income, and other items Costs for all other ordinary course smaller scale restructuring and legal charges and expenses from continuing operations are retained within both Total and Adjusted results. As Adjusted results include the benefits of Major restructuring programmes but exclude significant costs (suc h as significant legal, major restructuring and transaction items) they should not be regarded as a complete picture of the Group's financial performance, which is presented in Total results. The exclusion of other Adjusting items may result in Adjusted ea rnings being materially higher or lower than Total earnings. In particular, when significant impairments, restructuring charges and legal costs are excluded, Adjusted earnings will be higher than Total earnings. GSK has undertaken a number of Major restructuring programmes in response to significant changes in the Group's trading environment or overall strategy or following material acquisitions. Within the Pharmaceuticals sector, the highly regulated manufacturing operations and supply chains and lo ng lifecycle of the business mean that restructuring programmes, particularly those that involve the rationalisation or closure of manufacturing or R&D sites are likely to take several years to complete. Costs, both cash and non -cash, of these programmes a re provided for as individual elements are approved and meet the accounting recognition criteria. As a result, charges may be incurred over a number of years following the initiation of a Major restructuring programme. Significant legal charges and expens es are those arising from the settlement of litigation or government investigations that are not in the normal course and materially larger than more regularly occurring individual matters. They also include certain major legacy matters. Issued: Wednesday, 26 April 2023, London, U.K. Press release First quarter 2023 17 Research and development ESG Total and Adjusted results Financial information Audit or's review report Results Summary Reconciliations between Total and Adjusted results, providing further information on the key Adjusting items, are set out on pages 18 and 19. GSK provides earnings guidance to the investor community on the basis of Adjusted results. This is in line with peer companies an d expectations of the investor community, supporting easier comparison of the Group's performance with its peers. GSK is not able to give guidance for Total results as it cannot reliably forecast certain material elements of the Total results, particularly the future fair value movements on contingent consideration and put options that can and have given rise to significant adjustments driven by external factors such as currency and other movements in capital markets. ViiV Healthcare ViiV Healthcare is a subsidiary of the Group and 100% of its operating results (turnover, operating profit, profit after tax) are included within the Group income statement. Earnings are allocated to the three shareholders of ViiV Healthcare on the basis of their respective equity shareholdings (GSK 78.3%, Pfizer 11.7% and Shionogi 10%) and their entitlement to preferential dividends, which are determined by the performance of certain products that each shareholder contributed. As the relative performance of these products changes over time, the proportion of the overall earnings allocated to each shareholder also changes. In particular, the increasing proportion of sales of dolutegravir and cabotegravir - containing products has a favourable impact on the p roportion of the preferential dividends that is allocated to GSK. Adjusting items are allocated to shareholders based on their equity interests. GSK was entitled to approximately 83% of the Total earnings and 82% of the Adjusted earnings of ViiV Healthcare for 2022. As consideration for the acquisition of Shionogi's interest in the former Shionogi -ViiV Healthcare joint venture in 2012, Shionogi received the 10% equity stake in ViiV Healthcare and ViiV Healthcare also agreed to pay additional future cash co nsideration to Shionogi, contingent on the future sales performance of the products being developed by that joint venture, dolutegravir and cabotegravir. Under IFRS 3 'Business combinations', GSK was required to provide for the estimated fair value of this contingent consideration at the time of acquisition and is required to update the liability to the latest estimate of fair value at each subsequent period end. The liability for the contingent consideration recognised in the balance sheet at the date of a cquisition was \u00a3659 million. Subsequent remeasurements are reflected within other operating income/(expense) and within Adjusting items in the income statement in each period. Cash payments to settle the contingent consideration are made to Shionogi by ViiV Healthcare each quarter, based on the actual sales performance and other income of the relevant products in the previous quarter. These payments reduce the balance sheet liab ility and hence are not recorded in the income statement. The cash payments made to Shionogi by ViiV Healthcare in Q1 2023 were \u00a3 287 million. As the liability is required to be recorded at the fair value of estimated future payments, there is a significan t timing difference between the charges that are recorded in the Total income statement to reflect movements in the fair value of the liability and the actual cash payments made to settle the liability. Further explanation of the acquisition -related arran gements with ViiV Healthcare are set out on pages 71 and 72 of the Annual Report 2022 .

The \u00a3 105 million credit relating to the ViiV Healthcare put option and Pfizer preferential dividends represented a reduction in the valuation of the pu t option primarily as a result of updated exchange rates as well as updated sales forecasts and lower cash balances. The ViiV Healthcare contingent consideration liability is fair valued under IFRS. An explanation of the accounting for the non -controlling interests in ViiV Healthcare is set out on page 17. The \u00a369 million credit relating to the contingent consideration on the former Novartis Vaccines business primarily relates to changes to future sales forecasts. Divestments, significant legal charges, and other items Divestments, significant legal charges and other items primarily included dividend and distribution income received from investments partly offset by fair value loss o f \u00a365 million on the retained stake in Haleon.

GSK report s results under two segments: Commercial Operations and Total R&D. Members of the GLT are responsible for each segment. The Consumer Healthcare segment is presente d as discontinued operations in Q1 2022 for comparative purposes and therefore no segment information is presented. R&D investment is essential fo r the sustainability of the business. However, for segment reporting the Commercial operating profits exclude allocations of globally funded R&D. The Total R&D segment is the responsibility of the Chief Scientific Officer and is reported as a separate seg ment. The operating costs of this segment includes R&D activities across Specialty Medicines, including HIV and Vaccines. It include s R&D and some SG&A costs relating to regulatory and other functions. The Group's management reporting process allocates in tra-Group profit on a product sale to the market in which that sale is recorded, and the profit analyses below have been presented on that basis.

Issued: Wednesday, 26 April 2023, London, U.K. Press release First quarter 2023 29 Research and development ESG Total and Adjusted results Financial information Audit or's review report Results Summary Legal matter s The Group is involved in significant legal and administrative proceedings, principally product liability, intellectual property, tax, anti -trust, consumer fraud and governmental investigations, which are more fully described in the 'Legal Proceedings' note in the Annual Report 2022. At 31 March 2023, t he Group's aggregate provision for legal and other disputes (not including tax matters described on page 9) was \u00a30.3 billion (31 December 2022: \u00a30. 2 billion). The Group may become involved in significant legal proceedings in respect of which it is not po ssible to meaningfully assess whether the outcome will result in a probable outflow, or to quantify or reliably estimate the liability, if any, that could result from ultimate resolution of the proceedings. In these cases, the Group would provide appropria te disclosures about such cases, but no provision would be made. The ultimate liability for legal claims may vary from the amounts provided and is dependent upon the outcome of litigation proceedings, investigations and possible settlement negotiations. T he Group's position could change over time, and, therefore, there can be no assurance that any losses that result from the outcome of any legal proceedings will not exceed by a material amount the amount of the provisions reported in the Group's financial accounts. Significant legal developments since the date of the Annual Report 2022: Intellectual Property Coreg On 29 March 2023, the US Solicitor General filed a brief with the US Supreme Court expressing the view that Teva's petition for certiorari should be granted. GSK filed a reply to the US Solicitor General's brief on 11 April 2023, again arguing that Teva's petition for certiorari be denied. Tivicay In September 2021, ViiV Healthcare received a paragraph IV letter from Lupin Ltd. (L upin) relating to the Tivicay 5mg dosage for oral suspension, challenging only the crystal form patent. On 2 November 2021, ViiV Healthcare filed suit against Lupin in the US District Court for the District of Delaware. In March 2023, the parties reached a settlement, thereby concluding the matter. Juluca On 12 June 2020, ViiV Healthcare received a paragraph IV letter from Cipla Ltd. (Cipla) relating to Juluca . On 22 July 2020, ViiV Healthcare filed suit against Cipla in the US District Court for the Distr ict of Delaware. In March 2023, the parties reached a settlement, thereby concluding the matter. Product Liability Zantac On 23 March 2023, the court presiding over the California Zantac litigation cases issued a Sargon ruling in the first case scheduled for trial ( Goetz ). The court found that the plaintiff's experts' causation opinions are admissible and can be presented to a jury. This ruling does not mean that the Court agrees with pla intiff's experts' scientific conclusions as plaintiff must still prove his case at trial. The ruling applies only to the Goetz case and does not affect any other state cases or the December 2022 MDL Daubert ruling. The Goetz trial is scheduled to begin on 24 July 2023. Two cases have been set for trial in 2024 in the Cook County, Illinois proceedings. GSK will continue to defend itself vigorously against all claims. Sales and marketing and regulation US electronic health records subpoena On 19 March 2023, the Group received a subpoena from the United States Attorney's Office for the Western District of Virginia, which is working with the United States Department of Justice Civil Division, seeking documents relating to the Group's electronic heal th record program mes. The Group is cooperating with this enquiry. Commercial and corporate Zejula Royalty Dispute Trial was held the week of 6 March 2023 and judgment was entered against the Group on 5 April 2023. The Court upheld AstraZeneca's interpretation that all current uses of Zejula generate royalty -bearing sales under the wording of the two license agreements . Accordingly, GSK will owe back royalties to AstraZeneca in an amount to be determined in a separate phase of the proceedings. The Group will also be responsible for paying on this same basis going forward. The Group is considering an appeal. Issued: Wednesday, 26 April 2023, London, U.K. Press release First quarter 2023 30 Research and development ESG Total and Adjusted results Financial information Audit or's review report Results Summary Returns to shareholders Quarterly dividends The Board has declared a first interim dividend for Q1 2023 of 14p per share (Q 1 2022: 17.50 p(1) per share retrospectively adjusted for the Share Consolidation ). Dividends remain an essential component of total shareholder return and GSK recognises the importance of dividends to shareholders. On 23 June 2021, at the GSK Investor Update, GSK set out that from 2022 a progressive dividend policy will be implemented guided by a 40 to 60 percent pay -out ratio through the investment cycle. The dividend policy, the total expected cash distribution, and the respective dividend pay -out ratios for GSK remain unchanged . GSK expects to declare a dividend of 56.5p per share for 2023.

They are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to distribute. Non-current assets included as part of a disposal group are not depreciated or amortised while they are classified as held for distribution. The assets and liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for distribution are presented separately from th e other assets and liabilities in the balance sheet. A discontinued operation is a component of the entity that has been disposed of or distributed or is classified as held for distribution and that represents a separate major line of business. The resul ts of discontinued operations are presented separately in the statement of profit or loss and comparatives are restated on a consistent basis. The Q1 2022 comparative figures have been restated on a consistent basis in the first quarter 2023 from those previously published to reflect the demerger of the Consumer Healthcare business in July 2022.

Exchange rates GSK operates in many countries and earns revenues and incurs costs in many currencies. The results of the Group, as reported in Sterling, are affected by movements in exchange rates between Sterling and other currencies. Average exchange rates, as modified by specific transaction rates for large transactions, prevailing during the period, are used to translate the results and cash flows of overseas subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures into Sterling. Period -end rates are used to translate the net assets of those entities. The currencies which most influenced these translations and the relevant exchange rates were: Q1 2023 Q1 2022 2022 Average 1.24 Euro/\u00a3 1.17 Yen/\u00a3 162 156 161 Period -end rates: US$/\u00a3 1.24 1.31 1.20 Euro/\u00a3 1.14 1.18 1.13 Yen/\u00a3 165 160 159 Issued: Wednesday, 26 April 2023, London, U.K. Press release First quarter 2023 32 Research and development ESG Total and Adjusted results Financial information Audit or's review report Results Summary Net assets The book value of net assets increased by \u00a31,216 million from \u00a310,096 million at 31 December 2022 to \u00a311,312 million at 31 March 2023. This primarily reflected contribution from Total comprehensive income for the period partly offset by dividend paid to sh areholders. At 31 March 2023, the net deficit on the Group's pension plans was \u00a3966 million compared with \u00a31,355 million at 31 December 2022. This decrease in the net deficit is primarily driven by higher asset values in the UK. The estimated present v alue of the potential redemption amount of the Pfizer put option related to ViiV Healthcare, recorded in Other payables in Current liabilities, was \u00a3988 million (31 December 2022: \u00a31,093 million). Contingent consideration amounted to \u00a3 6,584 million at 31 March 2023 (31 December 2022: \u00a37,068 million), of which \u00a3 5,539 million (31 December 2022: \u00a35,890 million) represented the estimated present value of amounts payable to Shionogi relating to ViiV Healthcare, \u00a3 587 million (31 December 2022: \u00a3673 million) repr esented the estimated present value of contingent consideration payable to Novartis related to the Vaccines acquisition and \u00a3455 million (31 December 2022: \u00a3501 million ) represented the estimated present value of contingent consideration payable to Affiniv ax. Of the contingent consideration payable (on a post -tax basis) to Shionogi at 31 March 2023, \u00a3925 million (31 December 202 2: \u00a3940 million) is expected to be paid within one year.

Infectious Diseases bepirovirsen (HBV ASO) Bepirovirsen is a potential new treatment option for people with chronic hepatitis B being evaluated a monotherapy or combination therapy with both existing and novel treatments. Two randomised, double -blind, placebo -controlled phase III trials (B -Well 1 and B -Well 2) evaluating the safety and efficacy of bepirovirsen started in Q1 2023 and are actively recruiting patients. Key trials for bepirovirsen: Trial name (population) Phase Design Timeline Status B-Well 1 bepirovirsen in nucleos(t)ide treated patients (chronic hepatitis B) NCT05630807 III A multi -centre, randomised, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial to confirm the efficacy and safety of treatment with bepirovirsen in participants with chronic hepatitis B virus Trial Start: Q1 2023 Recruiting B-Well 2 bepirovirsen in nucleos(t)ide treated patients (chronic hepatitis B) NCT05630820 III A multi -centre, randomised, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial to confirm the efficacy and safety of treatment with bepirovirsen in participants with chronic hepatitis B virus Trial Start: Q1 2023 Recruiting B-Clear bepirovirsen A multi -centre, randomised, partial -blind parallel cohort trial to assess the efficacy and safety of treatment with bepirovirsen in participants with chronic hepatitis B virus Trial start: Q3 2020 Complete; full data presente d B-Together bepirovirsen therapy with Peg hepatitis B) NCT04676724 IIb A multi -centre, randomised, open label trial to assess the efficacy and safety of sequential treatment with bepirovirsen followed by Pegylated Interferon Alpha 2a in participants with chronic hepatitis B virus Trial start: Q1 2021 Active, not recruiting bepirovirsen sequential combination therapy with targeted immunotherapy (chronic hepatitis B) NCT05276297 II A trial on the safety, efficacy and immune response following sequential treatment with an anti -sense oligonucleotide against chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and chronic hepatitis B targeted immunotherapy (CHB -TI) in CHB patients receiving Q2 Recruiting gepotidacin (bacterial topoisomerase inhibitor) In April 2023, GSK presented positive results from the pivotal EAGLE -2 and EAGLE -3 phase III trials on 15 April 2023 for gepotidacin as a potential treatment for uncomplicated urinary tract infections (uUTI) in an oral presentation at the Europea n Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectio us Diseases in Copenhagen, Denmark. In the EAGLE -2 and EAGLE -3 phase III trials, gepotidacin demonstrated non -inferiority to nitrofurantoin, an existing first -line treatment for uUTI, in patients with a confirmed uUTI and a uropathogen susceptible to nitro furantoin. Additionally, in the EAGLE -3 phase III trial, gepotidacin demonstrated statistically significant superiority versus nitrofurantoin. These results are based on a primary efficacy endpo int of therapeutic success, an endpoint comprised of combined clinical resolution and microbiological eradication of bacteria at the Test -of-Cure (ToC) visit 10 -13 days after initiation of treatment. In the EAGLE -2 phase III trial, gepotidacin demonstrated therapeutic success in 50.6% of patients compared to 47% for nitrofurantoin. In the EAGLE -3 phase III trial, gepotidacin demonstrated therapeutic success in 58.5% of patients compared to 43.6% for nitrofurantoin. The safety and tolerability profile of gepotidacin in the EAGLE -2 and EAGLE -3 phase III trials was consi stent with previous trials. Issued: Wednesday, 26 April 2023, London, U.K. Press release First quarter 2023 37 Research and development ESG Total and Adjusted results Financial information Audit or's review report Results Summary The presentation follows the decision to stop the EAGLE -2 and EAGLE -3 pivotal trials early for efficacy following a recommendation made by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee in November 2022. The full results will be su bmitted for publication in a peer -reviewed scientific journal later this year.

The primary endpoint data demonstrated statistical non-inferiority compared to Bexsero and Menveo in individuals 10 -25 years old, eliciting a clinically meaningful immune response. If approved, this five-in-one vaccine candidate could provide the broadest meningococcal serogroup coverage and could lead to a simplified immunisation schedule. Detailed r esults from this phase III trial will be presented in a peer -reviewed publication and at upcoming scientific meetings. Based on these results, GSK intends to submit a Biologics License Applicatio n to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to approve of its MenABCWY combination vaccine candidate. Key trials for MenABCWY vaccine candidate: Trial name (population) Phase Design Timeline Status MenABCWY - 019 NCT04707391 IIIb A randomised, controlled, observer -blind to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of GSK's meningococcal ABCWY vaccine when administered in healthy adolescents and adults, previously primed with meningococcal ACWY vaccine Trial start: Q1 2021 Active, V72 72 NCT04502693 III A randomised, controlled, observer -blind trial to demonstrate effectiveness, immunogenicity, and safety of GSK's meningococcal Group B and combined ABCWY vaccines when administered to healthy adolescents and young adults Trial start: Q3 2020 Complete; primar y endpoints met RSV vaccine candidates In March 2023, the US FDA Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) voted that the available data supported the safety and effectiveness of GSK's respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) older adult vaccine candidat e for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV in adults aged 60 years and older. The Committee voted unanimously 12 -0 on effectiveness and 10 -2 on safety. The US FDA has assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act action date of 3 May 2023. Regulatory rev iews are ongoing elsewhere, including in the EU and Japan. The VRBPAC vote followed the publication of positive phase III trial results for the vaccine candidate in The New England Journal of Medicine .

Following the committee's posit ive vote, in March 2023 , GSK initiated a global, open -label, phase II clinical trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of dostarlimab as monotherapy - as a replacement for chemotherapy, radiation and/or surgery - for treatment -na\u00efve patients with dMMR /MSI-H locally advanced rectal cancer. The first patient was dosed in April 2023 . GSK intends to use data from this trial, alongside data from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center's ongoing trial of 30 patients, to support a supplemental Biologics Licens e Application (sBLA) for accelerated regulatory approval in this indication. Earlier in Q1 2023 , the US FDA granted dostarlimab Fast Track designation for the treatment of dMMR/MSI -H locally advanced rectal cancer. In February 2023 , the US FDA granted fu ll approval for Jemperli for the treatment of adult patients with dMMR recurrent or advanced endometrial cancer, as determined by a US FDA-approved test, that has progressed on or following a prior platinum -containing regimen in any setting and are not can didates for curative surgery or radiation. This approval was based on additional data collected from the A1 expansion cohort of the ongoing GARNET phase I trial, a multicentre, open -label, single -arm trial of Jemperli monotherapy in patients with advanced or recurrent solid tumours. Long -term outcomes from GARNET demonstrated an overall response rate of 45.4%. In March 2023 , GSK announced interim results from Part 1 of the RUBY/ENGOT -EN6/GOG3031/NSGO phase III trial investigating dostarlimab plus standard -of-care chemotherapy (carboplatin -paclitaxel) followed by dostarlimab compared to chemotherapy plus placebo followed by placebo in adult patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. The results demo nstrated the potential of dostarlimab plus chemotherapy to redefine the treatment of primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer versus chemotherapy alone. A 72% and 36% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death were observed in the dMMR/M SI-H and overall patient populations , respectively. A clinically meaningful overall survival trend was also observed at the interim analysis. In April 2023, GSK announced that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) validate d the marketing authorisation appli cation (MAA) for Jemperli plus chemotherapy for the treatment of dMMR/MSI -H primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer .

A Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) regulatory action is anticipated by year -end 2023. A New Drug Application (NDA) for momelotinib is also currently under regulatory review by the US FDA with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act action date of 16 June 2023 . Key phase III trial for momelotinib: Trial name (population) Phase Design Timeline Status MOMENTUM (myelofibrosis) NCT04173494 III A randomised, double -blind, active control phase III trial intended to confirm the differentiated clinical benefits of the investigational drug momelotinib (MMB) versus danazol (DAN) in symptomatic and anaemic subjects who have previously received an approved Janus kinase inhibitor (JAKi) therapy for myelofibrosis recruiting; primary endpoint met Zejula (niraparib) Zejula is approved in more than 40 countries as a maintenance treatment for certain types of ovarian, fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancer. The ongoing development programme includes several combination trials , including the FIRST phase III trial assessi ng niraparib in combination with dostarlimab as a potential treatment for first -line ovarian cancer maintenance and the phase III ZEAL trial assessing niraparib in combination with standard of care for the maintenance treatment of first -line advanced non -small cell lung cancer. In April 2023, GSK took the decision to permanently discontinue enrolment in the ZEST phase III 800 -patient trial, initiated in 2021 . This decision was due to eligibility challenges impacting the ability to fully enrol patients with early -stage breast cancer. During the conduct of the trial, GSK learned that the prevalence of a radiologically detectable metastatic disease among patients who are ctDNA positive is much higher than expected. This enabled patients to be referred for trea tment of metastatic cancer ahead of clinical symptoms. Consequently, because these patients were ineligible for the ZEST phase III trial, it has made enrolment in the trial much more challenging than previously thought .

Jesduvroq is the first innovative medicine for anaemia treatment in over 30 years and the only hypoxia -inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor approved in the US, providing a new oral, convenient option for patients in the US with anaemia of CKD on dialysis and for healthcare providers. Jesduvroq is currently under regulatory review with the EMA, with a r egulatory decision anticipated in the first half of 2023. When left untreated or undertreated, anaemia of CKD is associated with poor clinical outcomes and leads to a substantial burden on patients and healthcare systems. There remains an unmet need for c onvenient treatment options with efficacy and safety comparable to current treatments.

Continuing results repres ents performance excluding discontinued operations. GSK also uses a number of adjusted, non -IFRS, measures to report the performa nce of its business. Adjusted results and other non - IFRS measures may be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, information presented in accordan ce with IFRS. Adjusted results are defined on page 16 and other non -IFRS measur es are defined below and are based on continuing operations. Free cash flow from continuing operations Free cash flow is defined as the net cash inflow/outflow from continuing operating activities less capital expenditure on pro perty, plant and equipment and intangible assets, contingent consideration payments, net finance costs, and dividends paid to non -controlling interests, contributions from non -controlling interests plus proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, a nd dividends received from joint ventures and associates (all attributable to continuing operations). It is used by management f or planning and reporting purposes and in discussions with and presentations to investment analysts and rating agencies. Free ca sh flow growth is calculated on a reported basis. A reconciliation of net cash inflow from continuing operations to free cash flow from continu ing operations is set out on page 34. Free cash flow conversion Free cash flow conversion is free cash flow from continuing operations as a percentage of profit attributable to shareholders from continuing operations. Working capital Working capital represents inventory and trade receivables less trade payables. CER and AER growth In order to illustrate underl ying performance, it is the Group's practice to discuss its results in terms of constant exchange rate (CER) growth. This represents growth calculated as if the exchange rates used to determine the results of overseas companies in Ste rling had remained unc hanged from those used in the comparative period. CER% represents growth at constant exchange rates. \u00a3% or AER% represents growth at actual exchange rates. Total Net debt Net debt is defined as total borrowings less cash, cash equivalents, liquid investm ents, and short -term loans to third parties that are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. Share Consolidation Shareholders received 4 new Ordinary shares with a nominal value of 31\u00bc pence each for every 5 existing Ordinary share s which had a nominal value of 25 pence each. Earnings per share, diluted earnings per share, adjusted earnings per share and dividends per share w ere retrospectively adjusted to reflect the Share Consolidation in all the periods presented. Earnings per share Earnings per share has been retrospectively adjusted for the Share Consolidation on 18 July 2022, applying a ratio of 4 new O rdinary shares for every 5 existing Ordinary shares. Total Earnings per share Unless otherwise stated, Total e arnings per share refers to Total basic earnings per share. Total Operating Margin Total Operating margin is operating profit divided by turnover. COVID -19 solutions COVID -19 solutions include the sales of pandemic adjuvant and other COVID -19 solutions including vaccine manufacturing and Xevudy and the associated costs but does not include reinvestment in R&D. This categorisation is used by management and we believe i s helpful to investors through providing clarity on the results of the Group by showing the contribution to growth from COVID -19 solutions. Turnover excluding COVID -19 solutions Turnover excluding COVID -19 solutions excludes the impact of sales of pandemic adjuvant within Vaccines and Xevudy within Specialty Medicines related to the COVID -19 pandemic. Management believes that the exclusion of the impact of these COVID -19 solutions sales aids comparability in the reporting periods and understanding of GSK's growth including by region versus prior periods and also 2023 Guidance which excludes any contributions from COVID -19 solutions. General Medicines General Medicines are usually p rescribed in the primary care or community settings by general healthcare practitioners. For GSK, this includes medicines in inhaled respiratory, dermatology, antibiotics and other diseases. Specialty Medicines Specialty Medicines are typically prescription medicines used to treat complex or rare chronic conditions. For GSK, this comprises medicines in infectious diseases, HIV, oncology, immunology /respiratory and Other . Percentage points Percentage points of growth which is abbreviated to ppts.

Issued: Wednesday, 26 April 2023, London, U.K. Press release First quarter 2023 45 Research and development ESG Total and Adjusted results Financial information Audit or's review report Results Summary Guidance, assumptions and cautionary statements 2023 guidance GSK expects 2023 turnover to increase between 6 to 8 per cent, Adjusted operating profit to increase between 10 to 12 per cent and Adjusted earnings per share to increase between 12 to 15 per cent. This guidance is provided at CER and excludes any contributions from COVID -19 solutions. Assumptions related to 2023 guidance In outlining the guidance for 2023, the Group ha s made certain assumptions about the healthcare sector, the different markets in which the Group operates and the delivery of revenues and financial benefits from its current portfolio, pipeline and restructuring programmes. Taking Q1 2023 performance and the latest expectations for Q2 2023 into account, GSK now expects first half and second half turnover growth to be broadly similar and for General Medicines to be broadly flat to slightly down this year. GSK expects Adjusted operating profit growth to be lower in the first half of 2023 and higher in the second half, relative to full -year expectations. Despite the recovery of healthcare systems, uncertain economic conditions prevail across many markets in which GSK operates and we continue to expect to see variability in performance between quarters. We expect sales of Vaccines to increase mid -teens per cent, Specialty Medicines to increase mid to high single - digit per cent, and sales of General Medicines to be broadly flat to slightly down . These plannin g assumptions as well as operating profit guidance and dividend expectations assume no material interruptions to supply of the Group's products, no material mergers, acquisitions or disposals, no material litigation or investigation costs for the Company ( save for those that are already recognised or for which provisions have been made) and no change in the Group's shareholdings in ViiV Healthcare. The assumptions also assume no material changes in the healthcare environment or unexpected significant change s in pricing as a result of government or competitor action. The 2023 guidance factors in all divestments and product exits announced to date. The Group's guidance assumes successful delivery of the Group's integration and restructuring plans. Material costs for investment in new product launches and R&D have been factored into the expectations given. Given the potential development options in the Group's pipeline, the outlook may be affected by additional data -driven R&D investment decisions. The guidance is given on a constant currency basis. Assumptions and cautionary statement regarding forward -looking statements The Group's management believes that the assumptions outlined above are reasonable, and that the guidance, outlooks, ambitions and expectations described in this report are achievable based on those assumptions. However, given the forward -looking nature of these guidance, outlooks, ambitions and expectations, they are subject to greater uncertainty, including potential material impact s if the above assumptions are not realised, and other material impacts related to foreign exchange fluctuations, macro -economic activity, the impact of outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics, such as the COVID -19 pandemic and ongoing challenges and uncertainti es posed by the COVID -19 pandemic for businesses and governments around the world, changes in legislation, regulation, government actions or intellectual property protection, product development and approvals, actions by our competitors, and other risks in herent to the industries in which we operate.

We have read the other information contained in the Results Announcement, including the non -IFRS measures contained on pages 26 to 34 and considered whether it contains any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the information in the condensed set of financial information. Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the conden sed financial information in the Results Announcement for the three months ended 31 March 2023 is not prepared, in all material respects in accordance with the accounting policies set out in the accounting policies and basis of preparation section on page 31. Basis for Conclusion We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (UK and Ireland) 2410 \"Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity\" issued by the Financial Reporting Council for use in the United Kingdom (ISRE(UK)2410) . A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures . A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identi fied in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. As disclosed on page 31, the annual financial statements of the Company are prepared in accordance with United Kingdom adopted international accounting standards. The condensed set of fina ncial statements included in this Results Announcement have been prepared in accordance with the accounting policies set out in the accounting policies and basis of preparation section on page 31. Conclusion Relating to Going Concern Based on our review procedures, which are less extensive than those performed in an audit as described in the Basis for Conclusion section of this report, nothing has come to our attention to suggest that the directors have inappropriately adopted the goin g concern basis of accounting or that the directors have identified material uncertainties relating to going concern that are not appropriately disclosed. This Conclusion is based on the review procedures performed in accordance with ISRE (UK) 2410, howe ver future events or conditions may cause the entity to cease to continue as a going concern. Responsibilities of the directors The directors are responsible for preparing the Results Announcement of the Company in accordance with the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority. In preparing the Results Announcement, the directors are responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the d irectors either intend to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
