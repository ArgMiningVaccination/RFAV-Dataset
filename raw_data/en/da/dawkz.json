We find that guided meditation is very powerful and allows people to open their mind to remove blockages and restore flow. We also use sound and imagery to guide people in allowing their mind, body and spirit to move into a balanced space. As ordained ministers, We use the process of \"Laying of Hands\" as we believe that all healing comes from Jesus. We find this to be very powerful in allowing people to receive the healing that they are divinely meant to receive. How do you work with us? Send an email and we can jump on a call to see if this is a fit for both of us. I look forward to hearing from you! Disclaimer: I am not a Medical Doctor.
