BL 2021 Definition The measure provides the average monthly benefit cost paid to Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) enrolled medical (including immunizations and including prescription drugs) and dental providers on behalf of all CHIP-enrolled children ( which includes CHIP Phase II and CHIP Perinatal). Benefit costs are understood to include amounts paid to health plans, the dental contractor, and Department of State Health Services (DSHS) to cover vaccines. BL 2021 Data Limitations None. BL 2021 Data Source Integrated Eligibility staff furnishes a monthly report to HHSC containing the caseload for which each health and dental plan will incur costs during the following month. The numbers in that report are multiplied by the premium amount to be paid to the respective plans (including the portion for drug premiums, effective March 2012). For vaccine costs, HHSC receives a quarterly invoice from DSHS (or successor agency), which shows the amount used for vaccinating CHIP-enrolled children. The data source for prescription drug costs paid via Fee-For-Service is the monthly MH 494 report, provided by the state Medicaid contractor.

The desired outcome of community mental health services is to improve level of functioning to the highest level of independence possible. This measure provides information about this outcome for adults receiving community mental health services through an authorized level of care as determined by the Adult Needs and Strengths Assessment. BL 2020 Data Limitations Collection of data is dependent upon completion of the Uniform Assessment for Texas Resilience and Recovery as prescribed. BL 2020 Data Source Level of functioning is measured by the Life Functioning Domain of the Adult Needs and Strengths Assessment which measures an individual's lack of ability to function in various community settings over the past three months. This scale is used for persons with severe and persistent mental illnesses. Clinical staff are expected to administer Uniform Assessment at admission to community services, every 180 days and at planned dischar ges. Greater functional impairment scores reflect greater problems functioning in the community. The results of this assessment are entered into the department's data warehouse by staff at the local authority. BL 2020 Methodology For this calculation, the first Uniform Assessment upon admission and the latest Uniform Assessment which must have been completed at least 180 days after the initial Uniform Assessment are utilized. A decrease of 1 or more points in the second Life Functioning Domain score indicates improvement. The numerator is the number of adult consumers over the fiscal year with a minimum of two Uniform Assessments for Texas Resilience and Recovery with a decrease of 1 or more points in the second Life Functioning Domain score. The denominator is the total number of adult consumers over the fiscal year with a minimum of two Uniform Assessments for Texas Resilience and Recovery. The formula is numerator/denominator *100. BL 2020 Purpose Improved functioning in the community is an important indication that treatment is effective in reducing the functional deterioration associated with mental illness . There are four levels of care a mental health consumer may be assigned, level of care 1, 2, 3, or 4. Each level of care has a designated service package that the mental health consumer may receive. Persons receiving community mental health services achieve optimal benefit from those services appropriately addressing their identified needs.

The desired outcome of community mental health services is to improve level of functioning to the highest level of independence possible. This measure provides information about this outcome for children as measured by the Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths assessment during the fiscal year. BL 2020 Data Limitations Collection of data is dependent upon completion of the Child and Adolescent Uniform Assessment for Texas Resilience and Recovery as prescribed. BL 2020 Data Source The evaluation instrument for this measure is the Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths assessment which is part of the Child and Adolescent Uniform Assessment completed for all children at admission, every 90 days thereafter, and at termination of services. Level of functioning is measured by the Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths assessment, which measures an individual' s functioning in various community settings over the past thirty days. For this calculation, the first Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths assessment on the Child and Adolescent Uniform Assessment for Texas Resilience and Recovery and any subsequent administrations of the Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths assessment during the fiscal year are utilized . BL 2020 Methodology The Reliable Change Index will be used to measure change in Child & Adolescent Needs & Strengths assessment (asst) scores. During the 1 st yr of Tx Resilience & Recovery roll out, adequate data points will be collected to est the Reliable Chg Index for Child & Adolescent Needs & Strengths asst domain items. Comparing initial & subsequent Child & Adolescent Needs & Strengths asst scores will yield a Reliable Chg Index score that will or will not show statistically significant imprv on specific domain items. Calculation: Num=Total number of children/youth authorized into levels of care 1,2,3,4 orYoung Child(YC) who show reliable imprv on at least one Child & Adolescent Needs & Strengths asst domain as compared to the Reliable Chg Index identified for that domain whose last two Uniform Assessments are at least 90 days apart. Den= T otal number of children/youth authorized into LOC 1,2,3,4,orYC whose last two Uniform Assessments are at least 90 days apart. The formula is num/den. BL 2020 Purpose Stabilized or improved functioning in the community is an important indication that treatment is effective in reducing the functional deterioration associated with mental illness. There are five levels of care a mental health consumer may be assigned: 1: Medication Maintenance, 2: Targeted Srvs (counseling or skills development training), 3: Complex Srvs (counseling and skills development training), 4: Intensive Family Srvs ( Wraparound Srvs), or YC. Each level of care has a flexible array of services that the consumer may receive. There may be children whose authorized level of care does not match the level of care recommended by the Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths assessment; however, these exceptions are usually due to clinical judgment, resource issues, continuity of care per Utilization Mgmt guidelines and/or consumer refusal. Children receiving community mental health services achieve optimal benefit from those services appropriately addressing their identified needs.

OBJECTIVE OUTCOME DEFINITIONS REPORT 86th Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version 1 Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST) Date: Time: 529 Agency: Health and Human Services Commission Goal No. 5 Encourage Self-Sufficiency Objective No. 1 Financial and Other Assistance Outcome No. 4 Percentage of Eligible WIC Population Served Calculation Method: N Measure: N Percent Measure: Y BL 2020 Definition This measure represents the percent of potentially eligible clients that are provided services during the most recent month for which data are available. To be certified and participate in the WIC program, infants, children, and pregnant, postpartum, and breast-feeding women shall reside within the jurisdiction of the state, meet certain income and nutritional risk criteria. BL 2020 Data Limitations Most recent data available is used at reporting deadlines. BL 2020 Data Source Participation is reported in the output measure \"Number of WIC Participants Provided Supplemental Food per Month\". Potential eligibles come from the Texas WIC Program County Potential Eligible Estimates Report, which is produced by the Texas Department of State Health Services. Potential eligibles are an estimate of the number of pregnant, postpartum or breast-feeding women, as well as children up to the age of 5 whose family incomes are at or below 185% of the Federal Poverty Level. BL 2020 Methodology The percentage is calculated by dividing the most recent month's number of WIC participants by the estimated number of persons eligible for WIC services at the time the report is due. This calculation is based on a federal fiscal year. BL 2020 Purpose Measures the percentage of eligible WIC population served.

Adult victims denied shelter at an original site may find shelter (with assistance from the original site) at another location. A family member, friend, or another shelter may fill the need. Victims denied shelter may receive non -residential services. BL 2020 Data Limitations In rare instances, this count may be duplicated when a victim denied shelter at the original site seeks services in another location and is denied again due to lack of space. Data does not include walk-in clients or nonresidential clients who are seeking shelter. BL 2020 Data Source Data are obtained from the automated data collection system maintained by the Family Violence Program. Contractors not able to participate in this system submit their data manually to the Family Violence Program where it is combined with the automated data for reporting. BL 2020 Methodology Staff receives data from the automated system maintained by the Family Violence Program and queries data according to program requirements to obtain the total denied due to lack of space BL 2020 Purpose This measure is an indicator of the need for shelter services.

Placement is a dynamic process with the individual, family or guardian and community providers involved in the placement process. There is high variability in the amount of time needed for actual community placement due to the uniqueness of the individual's needs and the location preferences of the individual and family or guardian. BL 2020 Data Limitations With the implementation of the standardized instrument for recommending that individuals currently residing in state ID campus -based facilities be placed in the community, the data collected for this measure should have inter-rater reliability. BL 2020 Data Source The recommendation for placement in the community is from each individual's annual review. Recommendations for community placements are entered into the commission' s Client Assignment and Registration (CARE) system with the recommended movement code 5 (move from campus to community). Actual placement in the community is entered into the CARE system with the Assignment/ Absence code of CP (Community Placement). Persons employed by the SSLCs enter the annual review recommendations into the department's CARE system. BL 2020 Methodology For the numerator, the sum of days between community placement recommendation and actual placement for each state ID campus resident recommended for community placement and placed in the community during the fiscal year are added together. The denominator is the number of individuals placed in community during the fiscal year. The formula is numerator/denominator. BL 2020 Purpose Ideally, campus residents recommended for community placement would be placed within 180 days. (Movement within 180 days of an individuals recommendation for community placement is a requirement of the Promoting Independence Plan.) A shorter average wait indicates success in developing community placements for campus residents who can benefit from community placement.

It is actually a measure of the availability of Medicaid Waiver funded services (Home and Community-based Services and any others directly administered by the Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) in the future) and ICF/IID funding for new capacity. Movement from campus (i.e. state ID facilities which are large self-contained areas where individuals live and receive 24-hour supervised care) to community tends to be from one type of residential setting to another residential setting. BL 2020 Data Limitations None. BL 2020 Data Source Movement of individuals served by the HHSC campus-based system is recorded in the commission's data warehouse system by staff at the facilities . The source of data is the \"CAM3 Campus- Based Discharge/Community Placement\" Client Assignment and Registration (CARE) system from which indicates actual date of community placement. These forms are located in records available from the State Supported Living Centers. The Community Placement Living Plan is available in the clinical record and projects a date for community placement that may be changed based on a variety of factors. Assignment/Absence codes are used for these movements in the CARE system. The Community Placement (CP) code is used to indicate a community placement from a state ID facility. BL 2020 Methodology This is a simple count of persons with an Assignment/Absence code of CP over the fiscal year BL 2020 Purpose The implementation of the Governor's Executive Order, RP 13 and the Health and Human Services Commission's Promoting Independence Plan should have significant impact on this measure. Persons residing in state ID facilities that want community placement and for whom staff recommends community placement should have the opportunity for community placement.

The definition is based on the methodology used by the State Auditor's Office to calculate classified employee turnover for fiscal year 2007. BL 2020 Data Limitations There may be some minimal loss of data due to data entry transactions occurring after calculation. BL 2020 Data Source The HHSAS-HR system is used to identify full- and part-time employees with job class codes that correspond to APS caseworker positions including:5002 APS Specialist I; 5003 APS III; 5005 APS Specialist IV; and 5006 APS Specialist V. Job Class codes are subject to change. Should this occur, current equivalent codes will be substituted and documented in the performance folder. BL 2020 Methodology Divide the number of separations during the fiscal year (numerator) by the average number of APS caseworkers during the fiscal year (denominator) and multiply by 100 to achieve a percentage. The average number of APS caseworkers is calculated by totaling the number of APS caseworkers (defined as someone who worked at any time during a quarter) for each quarter of the fiscal year, and then dividing this total by the number of quarters. Should the SAO methodology change, the agency will work with LBB to update the measure definition in ABEST .

Each minimum standard has been assigned a weight based on the risk a violation of that standard would present to children in care. Standards that present the most risk to children in care when violated have been assigned a high weight. All administrative rules and laws are weighted high. Children are considered to be at risk when violations of law, rules, or standards with a high weight occur. BL 2020 Data Limitations None. BL 2020 Data Source Child care investigators enter the results of their investigations into the Child- care Licensing Automation Support System (CLASS). Information is obtained from queries on investigation information contained in the CLASS investigation tables.

Only the most serious violations, several non-compliances that create an endangering situation or patterns of repeated non-compliances result in remedial actions. Remedial actions are those that Licensing may impose if an operation is deficient in a minimum standard, rule, law, a specific term associated with the operation's permit, or a condition of evaluation, probation, or suspension. The four types of remedial actions are corrective, adverse, judicial and monetary. Agency homes and CPA branches are not eligible for remedial actions. BL 2020 Data Limitations Remedial actions not within the agency's jurisdiction are not entered in CLASS. Each facility will be counted only once per fiscal year, regardless of the number of remedial actions it received during the reporting period. BL 2020 Data Source Remedial actions within the agency's jurisdiction are entered into the Child-care Licensing Automation Support System (CLASS) with the date the action occurred. BL 2020 Methodology Divide the number of facilities with one or more remedial action (numerator) by the total number of eligible facilities during the reporting period (denominator) and multiply the result by 100 to achieve a percentage. BL 2020 Purpose The purpose of this measure is to determine the percentage of facilities with remedial actions. This will assist licensing staff in identifying the most serious violators. OBJECTIVE OUTCOME DEFINITIONS REPORT 86th Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version 1 Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST) Date: Time: 529 Agency: Health and Human Services Commission Goal No. 8 Regulatory, Licensing and Consumer Protection Services Objective No. 3 Professional and Occupational Regulation Outcome No. 1 Percent of Licensed/Certified Professionals with No Recent Violations Calculation Method: N Percent Measure: Y BL 2020 Definition Percent of the total licensed, certified, registered, permitted or documented professionals at the end of the reporting period who have not incurred a violation within the current and preceding two years (three years total). BL 2020 Data Limitations The numbers of violations are dependent on the number of complaints filed and the nature of those violations investigated. The agency has no control over either of these two factors. The agency also has no control over the number of individuals who meet the requirements for professional credentialing and/or professionals who choose to renew their licenses. BL 2020 Data Source The total number of professionals and the number of professionals who received a sanction is obtained from Regulatory Automation System (RAS). BL 2020 Methodology The percentage is calculated by dividing the total number of individuals currently licensed, registered, permitted, certified, or documented who have not incurred a violation within the current and preceding two years by the total number of individuals currently licensed, registered, permitted, certified, or documented by the agency. BL 2020 Purpose Licensing, certifying, registering, permitting, and documenting individuals helps ensure that practitioners meet legal standards for professional education and practice, which is a primary program goal. This measure is an indication of the percentage of individuals who have not committed violations of the laws, and/or rules governing the profession. This measure is important because it indicates how effectively the agency's activities deter violations of professional standards established by statute and rule.

BL 2020 Data Limitations Quality attributes are determined by SSA policy. The cases receiving a quality review are a random sample and do not include all case categories. The guidance for this review is found in SSA's Programs Operations Manual System (POMS), Section 30005.001 f f. For example, \"Group I\" (Decisional Errors) are the only errors that affect the DDS accuracy rate. \"Group II\" (Onset) and \"Group III\" (T echnical ) are not factored into the DDS's accuracy rate. The reviews are done by SSA components. BL 2020 Data Source Based on evidence reported monthly by the SSA Office of Quality Performance. BL 2020 Methodology Determined by SSA formula.

Cost savings and dollars identified for recovery that have not yet been collected (such as negotiated settlements and court-ordered restitutions) are not included in this measure. BL 2020 Data Limitations No limitations. BL 2020 Data Source The sources of recovery data include IG case management systems, the claims administrator system and databases, and data reported from IG partners who directly recover funds based on IG activities ( such as DSHS WIC recoupments and certain MCO collections). IG expenditure data is reflected, in coordination with HHSC Central Budget, in the HHS financial system of record. IG staff compile recovery data from the respective source systems and activities in a consolidated IG-wide tracking system on a monthly basis, and that data is then compared to total expenditure data across the IG for the same reporting period.. BL 2020 Methodology For the given reporting period, the sum of IG dollars recovered from all IG divisions (including Investigations, Inspections, Audit, and Litigation) is reduced by total IG expenditures in all funds. This quantity is then divided by the total IG expenditures in all funds. The result is then reported as a dollar figure. Calculation: (Recoveries - Expenditures) / Expenditures, expressed as a percentage. The percentage is then converted to a dollar figure (e.g. 30% ROI = $1.30 Recovered per $1 Expended). BL 2020 Purpose This is a measure of the ef fectiveness of the IG 's efforts to maximize recoveries to HHSC programs, demonstrating how the dollars allocated to the IG's office result in an overall savings. BL 2021 Definition The return on investment of combined Federal and State dollars that fund the Office of Inspector General (OIG). \"Recoveries\" refers to payments received by HHSC to satisfy financial obligations due the state. Recoveries include dollars actually recovered. Recoveries are handled by various programs in OIG. BL 2021 Data Limitations No Limitation. BL 2021 Data Source The sources of data are the OIG case management system and the claims administrator system and databases. OIG staff collects data on recoveries on a monthly basis, entering the information in the appropriate system and/or database. BL 2021 Methodology For the given reporting period, the sum of OIG dollars recovered is reduced by the sum of all OIG expenditures in all funds. This quantity is then divided by the sum of all OIG expenditures in all funds. The result is then reported as a dollar figure.

Expenditures are defined as payments made to providers for services delivered to individuals as well as amounts incurred for services delivered but not yet paid. The average monthly number of Medicaid non-waiver community attendant services individuals is defined under output measure 1 of this strategy. BL 2020 Data Limitations Completion factors must be used to estimate data for months that have not been closed out. BL 2020 Data Source Month-of-service to-date data that reports, by type-of-service, the number of individuals for whom claims have been approved-to-pay, the number of units of service approved-to-pay, and the amounts approved-to- pay are obtained from claims payment data provided by TMHP (the Medicaid claims administrator) that is accessed and reported through an agency-developed application that utilizes COGNOS software. BL 2020 Methodology Units of service paid to date for a given service month are divided by the number of individuals with claims approved-to-pay for the month of service to yield an \"average units per individual to date,\" which is then adjusted by adding the average amount of change expected to occur over the remaining payment months, using moving averages to calculate historical average amounts of change for each additional payment period. The amount paid for a given month is divided by the units of service paid to date for the month of service to yield an \"average cost per unit to date.\" The adjusted units of service per individual is multiplied by the average cost per unit times the number of individuals served (as reported in 1.2.2 OP 1). The sum of the expenditures for all months in the reporting period is then divided by the sum of the number of CAS individuals for all months of the reporting period. BL 2020 Purpose This measure reports the average cost of Medicaid non-waiver Community Services and Supports Community Attendant Services per individual per month.

BL 2020 Data Limitations Completion factors must be used to estimate data for months that have not been closed out. BL 2020 Data Source The number of individuals authorized to receive CAS services, as well as the number of units of service authorized, are obtained from the Commission's Service Authorization System (SAS) by means of ad hoc query. Month-of-service to-date data that reports, by type-of-service, the number of individuals for whom claims have been approved-to-pay, the number of units of service approved-to-pay, and the amounts approved-to-pay are obtained from claims payment data provided by TMHP (the Medicaid claims adjudicator) that is accessed and reported through an agency-developed application that utilizes COGNOS software. BL 2020 Methodology The monthly average for the reporting period is calculated by dividing the sum of the monthly number of individuals for all months of the reporting period, by the number of months in the reporting period. Completion factors are applied to claims data-to-date to estimate the final number of individuals receiving services. Census values estimated through the \"completion factor\" method are over-ridden for service months in which fewer than three payment periods of data is available (or for additional months if necessary, based upon analyst judgment.) For these service months, the census values are estimated by using the historical ratio of individuals served (based upon claims data) to individuals authorized to receive the service (per SAS). BL 2020 Purpose This measure is a mechanism for assessing the agency's performance as it pertains to implementing the provisions of this strategy. It provides a count of individuals served with the funding that has been appropriated.

BL 2020 Data Source Month-of-service to-date data that reports, by type-of-service, the number of individuals for whom claims have been approved-to-pay, the number of units of service approved-to-pay, and the amounts approved-to-pay are obtained from claims payment data provided by TMHP (the Medicaid claims administrator) that is accessed and reported through and agency-developed application that utilizes COGNOS software. BL 2020 Methodology The average monthly expenditure for the named group is calculated by dividing the total expenditures by the total by the number of projected recipient months to be incurred for the reporting period. Completion factors may be applied to incomplete data. Forecasting models and trends are used to project future expenditures and recipient months. BL 2020 Purpose This measure reports the average cost of Medicaid non-waiver Community Services and Supports Day Activity and Health Services (XIX) per individual per month.

BL 2020 Data Limitations Completion factors must be used to estimate data for months that have not been closed out. BL 2020 Data Source The number of individuals authorized to receive the above services, as well as the number of units of service authorized, are obtained from the commission's Service Authorization System (SAS) by means of ad hoc query. Month-of-service to-date data that reports, by type-of-service, the number of individuals for whom claims have been approved-to-pay, the number of units of service approved-to-pay, and the amounts approved-to-pay are obtained from claims payment data provided by TMHP (the Medicaid claims adjudicator) that is accessed and reported through and agency-developed application that utilizes COGNOS software. BL 2020 Methodology Individual counts are collected on a monthly basis. The monthly average for the reporting period is calculated by dividing the sum of the monthly individual count for all months of the reporting period by the number of months in the reporting period. Completion factors are applied to claims data-to-date to estimate the final number of individuals receiving services. Census values estimated through the completion factor method are over-ridden for service months in which fewer than three payment periods of data is available (or additional months if necessary, based upon analyst judgment). For these service months, the census values are estimated by using the historical ratio of individual served (based upon claims data) to individuals authorized to receive the service (per SAS). Please note that using an alternate method of estimation for periods with relatively few payment periods is consistent with actuarial standards of practice. BL 2020 Purpose This measure is a mechanism for assessing the agency's performance as it pertains to implementing the provisions of this strategy. It provides a count of individuals served with the funding that has been appropriated.

This is a measure of fee-for-service only. BL 2020 Data Limitations Because it takes up to 36 months to close out 100% of the days of service billed for a month of service, the Medicaid payments as well as the amount of individual income contribution ultimately incurred for months that have not yet closed out must be estimated based upon approved-to-pay claims data to-date. BL 2020 Data Source Month-of-service to-date data that reports, by type-of-service, the number of individuals for whom claims have been approved-to-pay, the number of units of service approved-to-pay, the amount of patient's \"applied income\" associated with approved-to-pay claims, and the amounts approved-to-pay are obtained from claims payment data provided to the agency by TMHP (the Medicaid claims adjudicator) that is accessed and reported through an agency-developed application which utilizes TM 1 software. BL 2020 Methodology The average daily nursing home rate for the reporting period less the applied income per day for the reporting period equals the net cost per Medicaid resident per day for each month in the reporting period. The net cost per Medicaid resident per day is then multiplied by the calendar days in the month to obtain the value for that service month. The average value for each reporting period is calculated by taking the sum of the product of the \"net nursing facility cost per average daily rate\" for each month in the reporting period (as calculated above), times the estimated \"average number of individuals receiving Medicaid-funded nursing facilities per month\" for each month of the reporting period, and dividing that sum by the sum of the estimated \"average number of individuals receiving Medicaid-funded nursing facilities per month\" for all months of the reporting period. BL 2020 Purpose This measure is important because it is a mechanism for assessing the agency's performance as it pertains to implementing the provisions of this strategy. It quantifies the total unit cost to HHSC for providing Medicaid reimbursed services in a nursing facility. This data is a useful tool for projecting future funding needs.

BL 2020 Methodology Data are computed by taking the number of Medicaid days of nursing facility services ultimately incurred for a month of service and dividing by the number of calendar days in the month to derive an average daily census. This result is the average number of individuals receiving services during the month. The reported data are calculated by dividing the sum of the monthly number of individuals receiving Medicaid-funded nursing facility services for all months of the reporting period, by the number of months in the reporting period. Completion factors are applied to claims data-to-date to estimate the final number of individuals receiving services. Census values estimated through the completion factor method are over-ridden for service months in which fewer than three payment periods of data is available. BL 2020 Purpose This measure is a mechanism for assessing the agency's performance as it pertains to implementing the provisions of this strategy. It provides a count of individuals receiving the service that expends the majority of funding appropriated to this strategy. This count is an indication of service demand and is a useful tool for projecting future funding needs.

The PNA is the amount of funds an individual is allowed to retain in order to pay for incidentals that are not provided by the institution. The standard SSI payment for a individual in an institution is only $30 per month. This is a fee-for-service only. All eligible individuals receive a supplemental payment of $15 per month. BL 2020 Data Limitations Does not apply. BL 2020 Data Source Individual counts are obtained from the department's Health and Human Services Administrative System (HHSAS) Financials. The payment amount is established by rule and does not vary by individual. BL 2020 Methodology Monthly individual counts for this measure are derived each month by dividing the monthly amount expended for this service by $15. The monthly average for the reporting period is calculated by dividing the sum of the monthly individual counts for all months in the reporting period, by the number of months in the reporting period. BL 2020 Purpose This measure is important because it quantifies the number of individuals who receive this service, which was mandated by the Texas Legislature.

BL 2020 Methodology Units of service paid to date for a given service month are divided by the number of individuals for whom claims have been approved-to-pay for the corresponding month of service to yield an avg units per ind. to date for a given month of service. The avg. units per ind. to-date amts for each service month are adjusted by adding the avg. amount of change expected to occur over the remaining pymt months, using moving averages to calculate historical avg. amts. of change for each additional pymt period. For each service month, the avg net cost per day of service is calculated by subtracting the avg. amt. of client income per patient day from the Medicare co-payment rate. The est.expenditure for each service month is calculated as follows: the (adjusted) units of service per ind. times the avg cost per unit times the number of individuals served (as calculated and reported in 1.2.5.OP-1). BL 2020 Purpose This measure is a mechanism for assessing the agency's performance as it pertains to providing services in this strategy. It quantifies the unit cost for the Medicare co-payment for eligible nursing facility residents. This data is a tool for projecting future funding needs.

BL 2020 Data Limitations Because it takes several months to close out 100% of the days of service billed for a month of service, the Medicaid payments as well as the amount of individual income contribution ultimately incurred for months that have not yet closed out must be estimated. based upon approved-to-pay claims data to-date. BL 2020 Data Source Month-of-service to-date data that reports, by facility size, the number of individuals for whom claims have been approved-to-pay, the number of units of service approved to-pay, the amount of patient's \"applied income\" associated with approved-to-pay claims, and the amounts approved to-pay are obtained from claims payment data provided by TMHP (the Medicaid claims adjudicator) that is accessed and reported through an agency-developed application which utilizes TM 1 software. In addition, the numbers of individuals authorized to recieve ICF-ID services by facility size are obtained from the commission' s Service Authorization System (SAS). BL 2020 Methodology For each facility size grouping , the average daily rate for the reporting period less the applied income per patient day for the reporting period equals the net cost per resident per day for each month in the reporting period. The net cost per resident per day is then multiplied by the calendar days in the month to obtain the value for that service month. The average value for each reporting period is calculated by taking the sum of the products of the \"monthly (net) cost per ICF-IID individual\" for each month in the reporting period (as calculated above), times the estimated \"number of (Medicaid- funded) persons in ICF/IID Medicaid beds\" (as defined in 1.2.7 OP 1)\" for each month of the reporting period, and dividing that sum by the sum of the estimated \"number of (Medicaid- funded) persons in ICF/IID Medicaid beds for all months of the reporting period.

BL 2020 Data Limitations Original claims for services provided may be submitted by providers of waiver services up to 95 days after the end of the service month. Therefore, for the current quarter, the numerator is an estimated expenditure amount based on prior period billing data and the denominator is the actual enrollments for the current quarter. BL 2020 Data Source Month-of-service to-date data that reports the number of individuals for whom claims have been approved-to-pay, and the amounts approved-to-pay are obtained from a claims payment report provided by HHSC enterprise, using data from the CARE system. BL 2020 Methodology Units of service paid to date for a given service month are divided by the number of individuals with claims approved-to-pay for the month of service to yield an \"average units per individuals to date\", which is then adjusted by adding the average amount of change expected to occur over the remaining payment months, using moving averages to calculate historical average amounts of change for each additional payment period. The average value for each report period is calculated by taking the sum of the product of the adj.monthly cost per ind. for each month in the rept. period, times the est. \"average number of ind. receiving HCS per month\" for each month of the reporting period times the number of months in the reporting period, and dividing that sum by the sum of the est.\"average number of individuals receiving HCS per month\" for each month of the reporting period times the number of months in the reporting period. BL 2020 Purpose This measure quantifies the unit cost for providing eligible individuals with services for which funding has been appropriated.

BL 2020 Data Limitations Original claims for services provided may be submitted by providers of waiver services up to 95 days after the end of the service month. Therefore, for the current quarter, the numerator is an estimated expenditure amount based on prior period billing data and the denominator is actual enrollments for the current quarter. BL 2020 Data Source This measure is derived from enrollment and billing data, which are provided on a monthly basis. The calculation uses the average billing rate per individual from the HCS billing system for the Residential slot type. Since there is a 95-day billing window for the waiver programs, the average billing rate is an average of the prior months that are complete. The calculation also uses the monthly number of individuals enrolled from the Client Assignment and Registration (CARE) system for the Residential slot type. The enrollment report provides the number of individuals entering and leaving by slot type. The ending enrollment balance at the end of the month represents the beginning balance for the next month by slot type. This combination of enrollments and average billing rates is used rather than utilizing the billing system alone because of the 95 day billing window for submitting claims. BL 2020 Methodology For the Residential slot type within the HCS program, the average billing rate for each month is multiplied by the number enrolled for those same months to determine a monthly expenditure amount. The monthly expenditure amount and number of individuals enrolled for the Residential slot type within HCS are aggregated into a total monthly expenditure amount and total number of individuals enrolled. The aggregated monthly expenditure amount for each of the three months in the reporting quarter is summed. The aggregated number of individuals for each of the three months in the reporting quarter is also summed. The quarterly aggregated expenditure amount is divided by the quarterly aggregated number of individuals enrolled for an average monthly cost per individual for the reporting quarter. Once the billing data for previously reported quarters is complete, the values reported in ABEST will be updated using only the aggregated average monthly billing rate for all waivers. BL 2020 Purpose This measure quantifies the unit cost for providing eligible individuals with services for which funding has been appropriated. It allows the agency to track the cost of HCS waiver-funded services over time, helps to maintain the fiscal integrity of the program by ensuring the availability of funds within appropriated resources and is a tool for projecting future funding needs.

The monthly expenditure amount and number of individuals enrolled for the Non-Residential slot type within HCS are aggregated into a total monthly expenditure amount and total number of individuals enrolled. The aggregated monthly expenditure amount for each of the three months in the reporting quarter is summed. The aggregated number of individuals for each of the three months in the reporting quarter is also summed. The quarterly aggregated expenditure amount is divided by the quarterly aggregated number of individuals enrolled for an average monthly cost per individual for the reporting quarter. Once the billing data for previously reported quarters is complete, the values reported in ABEST will be updated using only the aggregated average monthly billing rate for all waivers. BL 2020 Purpose This measure quantifies the unit cost for providing eligible individuals with services for which funding has been appropriated. It allows the agency to track the cost of HCS waiver-funded services over time, helps to maintain the fiscal integrity of the program by ensuring the availability of funds within appropriated resources and is a tool for projecting future funding needs.

BL 2020 Data Limitations Original claims for services provided may be submitted by providers of waiver services up to 95 days after the end of the service month. If the original claim is rejected for payment for any reason, the provider has up to 180 days from the end of the original service month to correct the claim and re-bill it. Since the documentation of a service being provided to an individual is based on these claims, accurate counts of numbers served during a fiscal year may not be available for several months past the fiscal year. Values reported in the Automated Budget and Evaluation System of T exas (ABEST) can be updated when the appropriation year closes and the LBB reopens the system. BL 2020 Data Source The providers of HCS waiver services submit Medicaid claims for the services provided during each month. The numbers of individuals served is taken from a standard production report. BL 2020 Methodology This is a simple unduplicated count of individuals that received HCS waiver services at the end of the fiscal year. BL 2020 Purpose Due to the high demand for these services, as indicated by the number of individuals waiting for waiver services, it is critical for the department to monitor how many individuals are receiving the service annually in order to determine the service level that will be carried into the next Fiscal Year and/or Biennium.

For purposes of this measure, interest is defined as placing one's name on the interest list with the local authority for HCS waiver services. The count only includes those individuals on the list who are in \"open\" status (I.e., it excludes those individuals who are being processed for eligibility to begin receiving the service.) BL 2020 Data Limitations The accuracy of the HCS interest list is dependent upon the submission of accurate data by the Local Authorities (LAs). There may be duplication of names between interest lists for ID services. BL 2020 Data Source An individual seeking ID services or an individual seeking ID services on behalf of another individual with intellectual or developmental disabilities begins the review of service options with the local authority staf f . If the individual, legal representative or family member decides they are interested in HCS waiver services, the name of the individual is entered onto the interest list for HCS waiver services in the CARE system. BL 2020 Methodology This is a simple count on the last day of the month of individuals whose names have been entered into the Client Assignment and Registration (CARE) system as interested in HCS waiver services. When calculating the average monthly number of individuals on the interest for a given fiscal year, the average of the months in the fiscal year is calculated. When necessary, future and past periods are estimated based on the counts of the available months. BL 2020 Purpose This measure is an indicator of the unmet need for services provided under the HCS waiver as currently funded by this strategy and is a tool for projecting future funding needs.

BL 2020 Data Limitations Because it takes several months to close out 100% of the claims for a month of service, the number of individuals ultimately served must be estimated for months that have not yet closed out, by using \"completion factors\" specific to each service applied to the number of individuals approved-to-pay to-date and/or the number of individuals authorized to receive services. The concept of completion factors is that data, as of a given number of claims processing months after the month of service, can be considered a certain percent complete based upon historical patterns. Therefore, for a given month of service, the number of individuals on approved-to-pay claims to-date divided by the appropriate completion factor equals the estimated number of individuals ultimately served. BL 2020 Data Source Month-of-service data that reports the number of individuals for whom claims have been approved -to-pay are obtained from a claims payment report provided by HHSC, using data from the CARE system. This report breaks down the data into individuals who received residential services vs individuals who received services in non-residential settings. BL 2020 Methodology The measure is calculated by dividing the number of individuals who received HCS residential services by the total number of individuals who received any HCS service, based upon claims payment data. BL 2020 Purpose This measure is a mechanism for tracking the percentage of those individuals in the HCS program that choose to live in a residential setting, as opposed to other alternatives.

Therefore, for a given month of service, the number of individuals on approved-to-pay claims to-date divided by the appropriate completion factor equals the estimated number of individuals ultimately served. BL 2020 Data Source Two types of data are used to calculate this measure. The number of individuals authorized to receive HCS services is obtained from the commission's Client Assignment and Registration (CARE) system . Month-of-service to-date data that reports the number of individuals for whom claims have been approved-to-pay, and the amounts approved-to-pay are obtained from a claims payment report provided by HHSC enterprise, using data from the CARE system . BL 2020 Methodology Individual counts are collected on a monthly basis. The monthly average for the reporting period is calculated by dividing the sum of the monthly individual counts (as described above) for all months of the reporting period, by the number of months in the reporting period. For the most part, the number of individuals ultimately receiving services are estimated by the \"completion factor\" method explained above, applied to claims data to-date. However, because of the normal amount of variation which occurs in processing billings from month-to month, the estimated census values estimated through the \"completion factor\" method are over-ridden for service months in which fewer than three payment periods of data is available.(Or additional months if necessary, based upon analyst judgment.) For these service months, the census values are estimated by using the historical ratio of individuals served (based upon claims data) to individuals authorized to receive the service (per CARE). BL 2020 Purpose This measure is a mechanism for assessing the agency's performance as it pertains to implementing the provisions of this strategy. It reflects the system-wide level of activity occurring over time and allows the agency to associate HCS waiver-funded services with related costs and outcomes.

Expenditures are defined as payments made to providers for services delivered to individuals, as well as incurred amounts for services delivered but not yet paid. The average monthly number of CLASS individuals is defined under output measure 1 of this strategy. BL 2020 Data Limitations Because it takes several months to close out 100% of the days of service billed for a month of service, the expenditures ultimately incurred for months that have not yet closed out must be estimated based upon approved-to-pay claims data to-date. BL 2020 Data Source Month-of-service to-date data that reports by type-of-service the number of individuals for whom claims have been approved-to-pay and the amounts approved-to-pay are obtained from claims payment data provided by TMHP (the Medicaid claims adjudicator) that is accessed and reported through an agency-developed application that utilizes COGNOS software. BL 2020 Methodology Estimates are derived by first dividing the exp. to-date for a given month of service by the number of ind. for who claims have been approved-to-pay to-date for the same month of service to yield an average monthly cost per ind. served to date for a given month of service. The average monthly cost per ind. to-date for each service month is then adjusted by adding the average amount of change in cost expected to occur over the remaining payment months, using moving averages to calculate hist. average amounts of change for each add. payment period. However, because of the normal amount of variation which occurs in processing billings from month-to month, an alt. method is used for service months in which fewer than three payment periods of data is available. For these service months, the values are est. by using the average of the value generated by the methodology explained above, and the est. from the preceding month, plus the average monthly change for the two prior years.

BL 2020 Data Limitations Individuals on the list are contacted at least annually to determine whether they are still interested in remaining on the list and to verify contact information. BL 2020 Data Source Data are reported by means of a reporting database maintained by State Office program staff.Individuals are placed on an interest list by means of a telephone call to the State Office Interest List Hotline or by completion and submittal of Form 6501 Deaf-Blind Medicaid W aiver Interest List Form . The count only includes those individuals on the list who are in \"open\" status (I.e., it excludes those individuals who are being processed for eligibility to begin receiving the service.) The count may include individuals who are waiting for Deaf-blind with Multiple Disabilities Waiver services while receiving other Community Services and Supports. BL 2020 Methodology Counts are collected on a monthly basis. The monthly average for the reporting period is calculated by dividing the sum of the monthly counts of individuals on the interest list for Deaf- blind with Multiple Disabilities Waiver (as described above) for all months of the reporting period, by the number of months in the reporting period. BL 2020 Purpose This measure is an indicator of the unmet need for services provided under the Deaf- blind with Multiple Disabilities Waiver as currently funded by this strategy and is a tool for projecting future funding needs.

BL 2020 Data Limitations Because it takes several months to close out 100% of the claims for a month of service, the number of individuals ultimately served must be estimated for months that have not yet closed out, by using \"completion factors\" specific to each service applied to the number of individuals approved-to-pay to-date. The concept of completion factors is that data, as of a given number of claims processing months after the month of service, can be considered a certain percent complete based upon historical patterns. Therefore, for a given month of service, the number of individuals on approved-to-pay claims to date divided by the appropriate completion factor equals the estimated number of individuals ultimately served. BL 2020 Data Source Two types of data are used to report this measure. The number of individuals authorized to receive services are obtained from the commission's Service Authorization System (SAS) by means of ad hoc query.

Month-of-service to-date data that reports the number of individuals for whom claims have been approved-to-pay and the amounts approved to-pay are obtained from claims payment data provided by TMHP (the Medicaid claims adjudicator) that is accessed and reported through an agency-developed application that utilizes COGNOS software. BL 2020 Methodology Individual counts are collected on a monthly basis. The monthly average for the reporting period is calculated by dividing the sum of the monthly individual counts (as described above) for all months of the reporting period, by the number of months in the reporting period. For the most part, the number of individuals ultimately receiving services are estimated by the \"completion factor\" method explained above, applied to claims data to-date. However, because of the normal amount of variation which occurs in processing billings from month-to month, the estimated census values estimated through the \"completion factor\" method are over-ridden for service months in which fewer than three payment periods of data is available.(Or additional months if necessary, based upon analyst judgment.) For these service months, the census values are estimated by using the historical ratio of individuals served (based upon claims data) to individuals authorized to receive the service (per SAS). BL 2020 Purpose This measure is a mechanism for assessing the agency's performance as it pertains to implementing the provisions of this strategy. It reflects the system-wide level of activity occurring over time and allows the agency to associate Medicaid Deaf-blind with Multiple Disabilities waiver-funded services with related costs and outcomes. Please note that using an alternate method of estimation for periods with relatively few payment periods is consistent with actuarial standards of practice.

BL 2020 Data Limitations Because it takes several months to close out 100% of the services billed for a month of service, the expenditures ultimately incurred for months that have not yet closed out must be estimated based upon approved-to-pay claims data to-date BL 2020 Data Source Month-of-service to-date data that reports the number of individuals for whom claims have been approved-to-pay, and the amounts approved-to-pay are obtained from a claims payment report provided by HHSC enterprise, using data from the CARE system. BL 2020 Methodology First divide expenditures for a given month by the number of ind. to yield an avg monthly cost. This is then adj. by adding the avgchange in cost expected over the remaining payment months, using moving avgs to calculate hist. average amounts of change for each additional payment period. When fewer than 3 payment periods of data is avail, the values are est. by using the avg of the value generated by the methodology above, and the est. from the preceding month, plus the avg monthly change for the 2 prior years. The average value for each report period is calculated by taking the sum of the product of the adj.monthly cost per ind. for each month in the rept. period, times the est. \"average number of ind. receiving HCS per month\" for each month of the reporting period times the number of months in the reporting period, and dividing that sum by the sum of the est.\"average number of individuals receiving HCS per month\" for each month times the number of months in the reporting period. BL 2020 Purpose This measure quantifies the unit cost for providing eligible individuals with services for which funding has been appropriated. It allows the agency to track the cost of TxHmL waiver-funded services over time, helps to maintain the fiscal integrity of the program by ensuring the availability of funds within appropriated resources and is a tool for projecting future funding needs.

BL 2020 Data Limitations Original claims for services provided may be submitted by providers of waiver services up to 95 days after the end of the service month. If the original claim is rejected for payment for any reason, the provider has up to 180 days from the end of the original service month to correct the claim and re-bill it. Since the documentation of a service being provided to an individual is based on these claims, accurate counts of numbers served may not be available for several months past the fiscal year. Updates to the values reported in the Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST) will be available when the appropriation year closes. BL 2020 Data Source The providers of waiver services submit Medicaid claims for the services provided during each month. The numbers of individuals served is taken from a standard production report. BL 2020 Methodology This is a simple unduplicated count of individuals that received TxHmL waiver services at the end of the fiscal year. BL 2020 Purpose Due to the very high demand for these services, as indicated by the number of individuals waiting for TxHmL waiver services, it is critical that the commission monitors how many individuals are receiving the service annually.

For purposes of this measure, interest is defined as placing one's name on the interest list with the local authority for TxHmL waiver services. The count only includes those individuals on the list who are in \"open\" status (I.e., it excludes those individuals who are being processed for eligibility to begin receiving the service.) BL 2020 Data Limitations The accuracy of theTxHmL interest list is dependent upon the submission of accurate data by the Local Authorities (LAs). There may be duplication of names between interest lists for ID services. BL 2020 Data Source An individual seeking ID services or an individual seeking ID services on behalf of another individual with intellectual or developmental disabilities begins the review of service options with the local authority staf f. If the individual, legal representative or family member decides they are interested in TxHmL waiver services , the name of the individual is entered onto the interest list for TxHmL waiver services in the CARE system. BL 2020 Methodology This is a simple count on the last day of the month of individuals whose names have been entered into the Client Assignment and Registration (CARE) system as interested in TxHmL waiver services. When calculating the average monthly number of individuals on the interest list for a given fiscal year, the average of the months in the fiscal year is calculated. When necessary, future and past periods are estimated based on the counts of the available months. BL 2020 Purpose This measure is an indicator of the unmet need for services provided under the TxHmL waiver as currently funded by this strategy and is a tool for projecting future funding needs.

As individuals come to the top of the interest list, they are either enrolled, deemed ineligible, determined there is no af firmative response to enroll , or still in process. This measure excludes from the calculation those individuals who are still in process. BL 2020 Data Limitations Individuals on the list are contacted at least annually to determine whether they are still interested in remaining on the list and to verify contact information. Payment lag or using sample data may also be a limitation. BL 2020 Data Source Local Authority Staff enters data into the CARE Interest List system. Each month, reports are generated from this system that provide the number of individuals released from the interest list, the number of individuals enrolled, the number of non-enrollment enclosures, and the number of individuals in release status for whom the final disposition is still pending. BL 2020 Methodology The measure is calculated by dividing the number of individuals whose names were released from the TxHmL interest list and where the TxHmL interest list record for those individuals were closed during the fiscal year without the individuals being enrolled for TxHmL, by the total number of individuals whose names were released from the TxHmL interest list and where the TxHmL interest list record for those individuals were closed during the fiscal year.

Page 93 of 442 Strategy-Related Measures Definitions 86th Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version 1 Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST) 4/26/2019 6:15:47PM Agency Code: 529 Agency: Health and Human Services Commission Goal No. 1 Medicaid Objective No. 3 Long-term Care - Non-entitlement Strategy No. 6 Medically Dependent Children Program (MDCP) Measure Type EF Measure No. 1 Average Monthly Cost Per Individual: MDCP Waiver Calculation Method: Measure: N Percentage Measure: N BL 2020 Definition This measure reports the average cost of Medically Dependent Children Program (MDCP) Waiver services per individual per month. Expenditures are defined as payments made to providers for services delivered to individuals as well as incurred amounts for services delivered but not yet paid. The average monthly number of children served is defined under output measure 1 of this strategy. BL 2020 Data Limitations Because it takes several months to close out 100% of the days of service billed for a month of service, the expenditures ultimately incurred for months that have not yet closed out must be estimated based upon approved-to-pay claims data to-date BL 2020 Data Source Month-of-service to-date data that reports, by type of service, the number of individuals for whom claims have been approved-to-pay, and the amounts approved-to- pay are obtained from claims payment data provided by TMHP (the Medicaid claims adjudicator) that is accessed and reported through an agency-developed application that utilizes COGNOS software. BL 2020 Methodology First divide expenditures for a given month by the number of ind. to yield an avg monthly cost. This is then adj. by adding the avgchange in cost expected over the remaining payment months, using moving avgs to calculate hist. average amounts of change for each additional payment period. When fewer than 3 payment periods of data is avail, the values are est. by using the avg of the value generated by the methodology above, and the est. from the preceding month, plus the avg monthly change for the 2 prior years. The avg value for each report period is calculated by taking the sum of the product of the adj.monthly cost per ind. for each month in the rept. period, times the est. \"average number of ind. receiving MDCP per month\" for each month of the reporting period times the number of months in the reporting period , and dividing that sum by the sum of the est. \"average number of individuals receiving MDCP per month\" for each month times the number of months in the reporting period . BL 2020 Purpose This measure quantifies the unit cost for providing eligible individuals with services for which funding has been appropriated. It allows the agency to track the cost of MDCP-funded services over time, helps to maintain the fiscal integrity of the program by ensuring the availability of funds within appropriated resources and is a tool for projecting future funding needs.

Individuals are placed on an interest list by means of a telephone call to the State Office Interest List Hotline or through completion of a Form 3620, Intake/Summary of Individuals Need for Services. The count only includes those individuals on the list who are in \"open\" status (i.e., it excludes those individuals who are being processed for eligibility to begin receiving the service.) BL 2020 Data Limitations Individuals on the list are contacted at least annually to determine whether they are still interested in remaining on the list and to verify contact information. BL 2020 Data Source Counts are collected on a monthly basis. Data are reported by means of a reporting database maintained by State Office program staff. BL 2020 Methodology The monthly average for the reporting period is calculated by dividing the sum of the monthly counts of individuals on the interest list for MDC P (as described above) for all months of the reporting period, by the number of months in the reporting period. BL 2020 Purpose This measure is an indicator of the unmet need for services provided under the MDCP as currently funded by this strategy and is a tool for projecting future funding needs. BL 2021 Definition BL 2021 Data Limitations BL 4/26/2019 6:15:47PM Strategy-Related Measures Definitions 86th Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version 1 Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST) BL 2021 Purpose Page 96 of 442 Strategy-Related Measures Definitions 86th Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version 1 Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST) 4/26/2019 6:15:47PM Agency Code: 529 Agency: Health and Human Services Commission Goal No. 1 Medicaid Objective No. 3 Long-term Care - Non-entitlement Strategy No. 6 Medically Dependent Children Program (MDCP) Measure Type EX Measure No. 2 # Persons Receiving Svcs at the End of the Fiscal Year: MDCP Calculation Y New Measure: N Percentage Measure: N BL 2020 Definition This measure reports the number of individuals who, based upon approved-to-pay claims, received one or more services under the Medically Dependent Children Program (MDCP) during the last month of the fiscal year being reported. BL 2020 Data Limitations Because it takes several months to close out 100% of the claims for a month of service, the number of individuals ultimately served must be estimated for months that have not yet closed out, by using \"completion factors\" specific to each service applied to the number of individuals approved-to-pay to-date and/or the number of individuals authorized to receive services. The concept of completion factors is that data, as of a given number of claims processing months after the month of service, can be considered a certain percent complete based upon historical patterns. Therefore, for a given month of service, the number of individuals on approved-to-pay claims to date divided by the appropriate completion factor equals the estimated number of individuals ultimately served. BL 2020 Data Source Two types of data are used to report this measure. The number of individuals authorized to receive MDCP services are obtained from the commission's Service Authorization System (SAS) by means of ad hoc query. Month-of-service to-date data that reports the number of individuals for whom claims have been approved-to-pay and the amounts approved-to-pay are obtained from the commission's Claims Management System (CMS) by means of ad hoc query. BL 2020 Methodology This is a simple unduplicated count of individuals who received MDCP services during the last month of the fiscal year being reported. BL 2020 Purpose By reporting the number of individuals served at the end of the fiscal year, this measure allows the State to determine the service level that will be carried into the next fiscal year and/or biennium.

BL 2020 Data Limitations Individuals on the list are contacted at least annually to determine whether they are still interested in remaining on the list and to verify contact information. Payment lag or using sample data may also be a limitation. BL 2020 Data Source Community Services Interest List (CSIL) that is maintained by Agency Staff. Each month, reports are generated from this system that provide the number of individuals released from the interest list, the number of individuals enrolled, the number of non-enrollment enclosures, and the number of individuals in release status for whom the final disposition is still pending. BL 2020 Methodology The measure is calculated by dividing the number of individuals whose names were released from the MDCP interest list and where the MDCP interest list record for those individuals were closed during the fiscal year without the individuals being enrolled for MDCP, by the total number of individuals whose names were released from the MDCP interest list and where the MDCP interest list record for those individuals were closed during the fiscal year. BL 2020 Purpose This measure is a mechanism for tracking those individuals that come to the top of the interest list, they are either deemed ineligible, or there is no af firmative response to enroll expressed as a percentage of all individuals whose name was released from a MDCP interest list.

BL 2020 Data Source T wo types of data are used to report this measure. The number of individuals authorized to receive MDCP services are obtained from the commission's Service Authorization System (SAS) by means of ad hoc query. Month-of-service to-date data that reports the number of individuals for whom claims have been approved-to-pay and the amounts approved-to-pay are obtained from claims payment data provided by TMHP (the Medicaid claims adjudicator) that is accessed and reported through an agency-developed application that utilizes COGNOS software. BL 2020 Methodology The monthly average for the reporting period is calculated by dividing the sum of the monthly individual counts (as described above) for all months of the reporting period, by the number of months in the reporting period. For the most part, the number of individuals ultimately receiving services are estimated by the \"completion factor\" method, applied to claims data to-date. However, because of the normal amount of variation which occurs in processing billings from month-to month, the estimated census values estimated through the \"completion factor\" method are over-ridden for service months in which fewer than three payment periods of data is available.(Or additional months if necessary.) For these service months, the census values are estimated by using the historical ratio of individuals served (based upon claims data) to individuals authorized to receive the service (per SAS). BL 2020 Purpose This measure is a mechanism for assessing the agency's performance as it pertains to implementing the provisions of this strategy. It reflects the system-wide level of activity occurring over time and allows the agency to associate MDCP- funded services with related costs and outcomes.

BL 2020 Data Limitations None BL 2020 Data Source Actual expenditures are from the Health and Human Services Administrative System - Financials System (HHSAS-FS) for Program Activity Code (PAC) 580 (Guardianship Staff Services). The number of wards receiving HHSC and contracted guardianship services is currently from the Guardianship Online Database (GOLD) system; where the guardianship letter was issued on or before the end of the reporting month. This measure includes both new and on-going guardianship services provided directly by HHSC staff and contractors. GOLD has replaced the Information Management Protecting Adults and Children in Texas (IMPACT) data source for the number of guardianships. BL 2020 Methodology Annual expenditure projections for PAC 580 are made using an internal budget document that includes actual expenditures reported on HHSAS-FS for the reporting period, annualizing those expenditures and adding estimates for accruals and encumbrances. These amounts are totaled and the total is divided by the number of months in the reporting period to arrive at the average monthly cost. The average monthly cost per HHSC direct delivery and contracted guardianship ward served is calculated by dividing the average monthly cost by the average monthly number of HHSC direct delivery and contracted wards served. BL 2020 Purpose This measure is useful as a benchmark and to monitor changes in costs for serving direct delivery Guardianship wards.

The count includes both new and on-going guardianships that will be served by the Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) staff and contracted private guardianship programs. On-going guardianships refers to guardianships initiated in previous months and without closure dates. BL 2020 Data Limitations Documentation can be delayed by the volume of work, which is impacted by vacancies, sick leave, vacation leave, turnover, Guardianship Online Database (GOLD) system downtime, etc. BL 2020 Data Source Using GOLD, the data are gathered by counting HHSC's cases and contracted private guardianship cases open during the reporting period and cases closed during the reporting period, the number of cases as documented on the guardianship detail table in which wards' guardianship letters were issued on or before the end of the report month and the event activity type was coded as 'GUA' (numerator). The count includes direct-delivery and contracted guardianships. The denominator is the sum of months in the reporting period. The IMPACT detail table was replaced with a report from GOLD system . BL 2020 Methodology Divide the numerator by the denominator. When calculating the second quarter, third quarter, and fourth quarter, the year-to-date total is recalculated. BL 2020 Purpose The purpose of this measure is to show the average number of adults for whom HHSC was directly serving as guardian during the reporting period. It indicates part of the workload volume in the guardianship program.

Expenditures are defined as payments made to providers for services delivered to individuals as well as incurred amounts for services delivered but not yet paid. BL 2020 Data Limitations Because it takes several months to close out 100% of the claims for a month of service, the number of individuals as well as cost per individual per month ultimately served must be estimated for months that have not yet closed out, by using \"completion factors\" specific to each service applied to the number of individuals approved-to-pay to-to-date and/or the number of individuals authorized to receive services, the units of service approved-to-pay to- date, and the payment amounts approved-to-pay to-date. The concept of completion factors is that data, as of a given number of claims processing months after the month of service, can be considered a certain percent complete based upon historical patterns. Therefore, for a given month of service, the payment amounts approved-to-pay to-date divided by the appropriate completion factor equals the estimated expenditures ultimately incurred. BL 2020 Data Source Month-of-service to-date data that reports, by type-of-service, the number of individuals for whom claims have been approved-to-pay, the number of units of service approved-to-pay, and the amounts approved-to-pay are obtained from the commission's Claims Management System (CMS) by means of ad hoc query. BL 2020 Methodology The sum of monthly expenditures for non-Medicaid Title XX-funded Community Care Services Eligibility by month-of-service for all months in the reporting period is divided by the average monthly number of non- Medicaid Title XX-funded Community Care Services Eligibility individuals for the months of the reporting period; this is then divided by the number of months in the reporting period.

Expenditures are defined as payments made to providers for services delivered to individuals, as well as incurred amounts for services delivered but not yet paid. BL 2020 Data Limitations Because it takes several months to close out 100% of the claims for a month of service, the number of individuals must be estimated for months that have not yet closed out, by using \"completion factors\" specific to each service applied to the number of clients approved-to-pay to-date and/or the number of individuals authorized to receive services, the units of service approved-to-pay to- date, and the payment amounts approved-to-pay to-date. The concept of completion factors is that data, as of a given number of claims processing months after the month of service, can be considered a certain percent complete based upon historical patterns. Therefore, for a given month of service, the payment amounts approved-to-pay to-date divided by the appropriate completion factor equals the estimated expenditures ultimately incurred.

Services included under this category are: Family Care, Home-delivered Meals, Emer gency Response Services , Adult Foster Care, Day Activities and Health Services (funded through Social Services Block Grant), Consumer Managed Personal Attendant Services, Residential Care, and Special Services for Individuals with Disabilities. BL 2020 Data Limitations Because it takes several months to close out 100% of the claims for a month of service, the number of individuals ultimately served must be estimated for months that have not yet closed out, by using \"completion factors\" specific to each service applied to the number of individuals approved-to-pay to-date. The concept of completion factors is that data, as of a given number of claims processing months after the month of service, can be considered a certain percent complete based upon historical patterns. Therefore, for a given month of service, the number of individuals on approved-to-pay claims to date divided by the appropriate completion factor equals the estimated number of individuals ultimately served. BL 2020 Data Source Two types of data are used to report this measure. The number of individuals authorized to receive the above services, as well as the number of units of service authorized, are obtained from the commission's Service Authorization System (SAS) by means of ad hoc query. Month-of-service to-date data that reports the number of individuals for whom claims have been approved-to-pay, the number of units of service approved-to-pay, and the amounts approved-to-pay are obtained from claims payment data provided by TMHP (the Medicaid claims adjudicator) that is accessed and reported through an agency-developed application that utilizes COGNOS software BL 2020 Methodology Since a high percentage of individuals who receive Meals and/or Emergency Response Services also receive other services, an unduplicated monthly count of individuals receiving one or more non-Medicaid Title XX-funded community care services must be estimated. This is accomplished by multiplying counts for these two services by the percentage of individuals who are authorized to receive these services only, as opposed to these services in addition to other services, according to information obtained from SAS authorization data. Individual counts are collected on a monthly basis. The monthly average for the reporting period is calculated by dividing the sum of the monthly individual counts (as described above) for all months of the reporting period, by the number of months in the reporting period. BL 2020 Purpose This measure provides a count of individuals who received Non- Medicaid Title XX funded community care services, who did not receive other community services and supports (Medicaid entitlement or Medicaid Waiver services ).

ID community services include non-residential services including: vocational services, training services, respite services, and specialized therapies. BL 2020 Data Limitations This measure provides the actual number of individuals who receive community services and provides information about the total system activity during one fiscal year. It is a frequently requested number used to compare system activity over a period of two or more fiscal years. The accuracy of the commission's CARE system is dependent upon accurate and timely information being entered into the data warehouse system by the local authorities. BL 2020 Data Source As individuals enter the community programs, registration information is entered into the commission's Client Assignment and Registration (CARE) system portion of the data warehouse system by staf f of the local authority. When an individual is assigned to a specific program, this information is also entered into the data warehouse system. Production reports of individuals served are issued quarterly based on the information in the data warehouse system. Individuals who receive more than one community service during the year are counted only once for the year. BL 2020 Methodology The total unduplicated number of individuals that receive a ID community service during the fiscal year regardless of how the services for the individuals were funded is tallied for each local authority and system-wide.

BL 2020 Data Limitations Because it takes several months to close out 100% of the claims for a month of service, the number of individuals as well as cost per individual per month ultimately served must be estimated for months that have not yet closed out, by using \"completion factors\" specific to each service applied to the number of individuals approved-to-pay to-to-date and/or the number of individuals authorized to receive services, the units of service approved-to-pay to- date, and the payment amounts approved-to-pay to-date. The concept of completion factors is that data, as of a given number of claims processing months after the month of service, can be considered a certain percent complete based upon historical patterns. Therefore, for a given month of service, the payment amounts approved-to-pay to-date divided by the appropriate completion factor equals the estimated expenditures ultimately incurred. BL 2020 Data Source Month-of-service to-date data that reports the unduplicated number of individuals for whom claims have been approved-to-pay are obtained from claims payment data provided by TMHP (the Medicaid claims adjudicator) that is accessed and reported through an agency-developed application that utilizes COGNOS software BL 2020 Methodology For the most part, the number of individuals ultimately receiving services are estimated by the \"completion factor\" method explained above, applied to claims data to-date. However, because of the normal amount of variation which occurs in processing billings from month-to month, the estimated census values estimated through the \"completion factor\" method are over-ridden for service months in which fewer than three payment periods of data is available.(Or additional months if necessary, based upon analyst judgment.) For these service months, the census values are estimated by using the historical ratio of individuals served (based upon claims data) to individuals authorized to receive the service (per SAS). Please note that using an alternate method of estimation for periods with relatively few payment periods is consistent with actuarial standards of practice. BL 2020 Purpose This measure provides a count of eligible persons who are receiving Non Medicaid Community Care (XX / GR) services that contribute to enabling them to remain in their own home as opposed to being placed in another more restrictive setting.

ID community services include vocational services, training services, respite services, specialized therapies and excludes residential services. Quarterly and year-to-date performance is stated as the average of the months in the reporting period. BL 2020 Data Limitations The accuracy of the commission's Client Assignment and Registration (CARE) system is dependent upon accurate and timely information being entered into the data warehouse system by the local authorities. The Data Verification Criteria Manual provides general guidance regarding timelines for closure of assignments to specific services. BL 2020 Data Source As individuals enter the comm. progs, registration info is entered into the CARE portion of the data warehouse system by staff of the local authority. When an individual is assigned to a specific program, this information is also entered into the data warehouse system. Production reports of individuals served are issued quarterly based on the information in the data warehouse system. The total unduplicated number of individuals assigned to receive any ID community service each month is calculated. To obtain an unduplicated number of individuals, each individual is counted only once each period regardless of the number of dif ferent community services to which assigned. For each quarter of the fiscal year, the unduplicated number of individuals served in each month of the quarter is averaged. The production report lists total number of adults and children assigned to a particular service each month regardless of how the services for the individuals were funded. BL 2020 Methodology To obtain the number of individuals served with HHSC appropriation authority funds, HHSC uses a production report which reflects the numbers of priority population individuals served each month with general revenue (GR) funds and required local match. The numerator is the sum of the number of individuals receiving ID community service each month of the reporting period. The denominator is the number of months in the period. The formula is numerator/denominator. BL 2020 Purpose Monthly number of adults and children served reflects the system-wide level of activity occurring over time and allows the agency to associate this activity with related costs.

(This definition includes over issuances greater than the error tolerance threshold only, and encompasses such things as a client reporting inaccurate information, a client not reporting changes on a timely basis, agency failure to correctly apply policy, and so on.) BL 2020 Data Limitations Does not apply . BL 2020 Data Source Data are based on the quality control (QC) eligibility review, which uses a statewide random sample of TANF benefits. BL 2020 Methodology The reported data are computed as follows: The numerator consists of the number of benefit dollars in the QC sample for the period, minus the number of dollars issued in error for the period, as determined through the QC review process. Only over issuances greater than the error tolerance threshold are included. The denominator consists of the number of benefit dollars in the QC sample for the period. Dividing the numerator by the denominator yields the accuracy rate for the period.

BL 2020 Data Limitations For the federal review process, Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) randomly selects approximately one third of each state's annual sample and subjects each of the selected cases to an independent review to determine the accuracy of benefits issued. FNS uses its findings on this subset of cases to adjust the state's error rate through regression a term describing the statistical process of FNS projecting its findings from the subset of re reviewed cases to estimate what would have been found had a federal re review been conducted on all cases in the state's sample. For most states and in most years, the regression adjustment increases the state's error rate. BL 2020 Data Source Data are based on the quality control (QC) eligibility review and the Federal re-review process, which uses a statewide random sample of SNAP benefits. This sample complies with federally mandated precision tests. Annually, FNS calculates and publishes the of ficial error rate by the end of June for the prior federal review year . BL 2020 Methodology The data are computed as follows: The numerator consists of the number of benefit dollars in the QC sample for the period, minus the number of dollars issued in error for the period, as determined through the QC review process. The denominator consists of the number of benefit dollars in the QC sample for the period. Dividing the numerator by the denominator yields the accuracy rate for the period. The numerator includes both over issuances and under issuances, greater than the error tolerance threshold and it is the absolute value of the magnitude of the error that contributes to the numerator for example, two cases, one with a $50 over issuance and one with a $50 under issuances, do not cancel each other out but instead contribute a total of $100 to the numerator. The numerator also includes ineligible cases, with the contribution to the numerator being equal to the amount of the benefit issued. BL 2020 Purpose This measure is an indicator of accountability and efficiency of agency operations as it pertains to the issuance of SNAP benefits.

Assessment services are monthly services. Service coordination services may occur quarterly but are most frequently monthly services. Quarterly and year-to-date performance is stated as the average of the months in the reporting period, regardless of how the services for the individuals were funded. BL 2020 Data Limitations Because it takes 365 days to close out 100% of the claims for a month of service, the number of individuals ultimately served must be estimated for months that have not yet closed out, by using \"completion factors\" specific to each service applied to the number of individuals approved-to-pay to-date and/or the number of individuals authorized to receive services. The concept of completion factors is that data, as of a given number of claims processing months after the month of service, can be considered a certain percent complete based upon historical patterns. Therefore, for a given month of service, the number of persons on approved-to-pay claims to-date divided by the appropriate completion factor equals the estimated number of persons ultimately served. BL 2020 Data Source Month-of-service to-date data that reports, by type-of-service, the number of individuals for whom claims have been approved-to-pay, the number of units of service approved-to-pay, and the amounts approved-to-pay are obtained from the commission's Claims Management System (CMS) by means of ad hoc query. BL 2020 Methodology To obtain the number of individuals served with HHSC appropriation authority funds, the numerator is the sum of the number of individuals receiving ID assessment and/or service coordination services each month of the reporting period; the denominator is the number of months in the period. The formula is numerator/denominator. BL 2020 Purpose Monthly number of individuals served reflects the system-wide level of activity occurring over time and allows the agency to associate this activity with related costs.

BL 2020 Data Limitations The aging and disability resource center intake process will require identification of veteran status and a record of all related activities. Veteran status is recorded based on the individual's self-reported status in most instances. Some individuals may choose not to indicate veteran' s status. This is a contractor reported measure and may be subject to the limitations of the contactor's data systems. BL 2020 Data Source The number of veterans served is reported by the aging and disability resource center contractors quarterly by the 20th of the month following the end of each quarter. The Commission sums the reported totals from the aging and disability resource centers to create a state total.
