During this ceremony, we will embibe the magic and healing plant medicine that is Cacao and tap into the wisdom of our hearts so we can embody profound shifts in consciousness and our connection with community and our Higher Selves. We will then create the space to set intentions for the month ahead and integrate all of the intuitve work we've tapped into with a deeply healing Reiki infused sound bath and meditation to recharge and reset. No experience necessary, and all are welcome! Please wear comfortable clothing and bring your journal, crystals, eye mask and anything else you'd like to place on the altar to bless. "}
