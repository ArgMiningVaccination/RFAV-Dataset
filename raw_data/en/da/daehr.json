JAMES CLARK SCHOOL of ENGINEERING isr.umd.edu Learning from robots Students from many engineering disciplines benefit when they build and program robotic systems UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND / FEARLESS IDEAS2 SYSTEM SOLUTIONS FALL 2017Lessons learned Serving as the director of the Institute for Systems Research these past eight years has been a great privilege for me. In my last \"Direc- tor's Message, \" I would like to share with you a few of the lessons I have learned along the way. Were you prepared to be ISR director? Absolutely not! I walked into the director's office as a faculty mem - ber. Up until this point I had been going through my own promo - tion processes. The opportunity to become ISR director came about shortly after I was promoted to full professor. In my favor, I did have a history of helping my community no matter where or at what level I was. I managed a lab when I was a graduate student, and large projects as a postdoc first and then as a research scientist. As a faculty member, I played an active role in the launch of new entities like the Maryland NanoCenter, the Maryland Energy Center and the initial discussions for forming the Robert E. Fischell Institute for Biomedical Devices, in addition to launching and running my own research lab. I also was used to collaborating with neighboring national labs and working with interdisciplinary colleagues across campus and elsewhere. This, at least, helped me get started. But none of these things prepared me for the responsibili - ties that come with being in charge of an institute the size of ISR. I learned that just because you are a part of and are familiar with the environment of the university, it does not mean you understand its administrative processes. Y ou have to figure out what these priorities are and how your unit fits within them. Because the university had no formal program offering admin - istrative mentoring, I had to come up to speed quickly and seek mentoring from those I trusted to help me move for - ward. Mentoring is important! I would also say that faculty should not be shy about trying out a period of adminis - trative opportunity. There is much to be learned from seeing the university from this perspective, and from growing in your professional life when you are in a position where your primary tasks are to serve your fellow faculty, stu - dents, staff, and the organization at large, rather than your own interests. Seek out opportuni - ties on your own if they are not provided to you. What did you learn as direc - tor? I am grateful for everything I learned as the ISR director, but perhaps the most impor - tant thing is this: being an institute director or department chair mandates that you be completely selfless. This is not something we faculty members instinctively know, and it is certainly not something in which we are trained. As faculty, we are thinking all along about our own shops, what it is we need to do, and how we need to do it. W e take pride in our own accomplishments and those of the students in our programs. This is all meaningless in an administrative position! T o be success - ful in this job, the accomplishments, failures, progress, and well-being of the community must be your priorities. Helping junior faculty over - come their problems, and encouraging senior faculty to let go of their ingrained habits requires you to be a selfless person who can make your unit's wellbeing the top priority, no matter what is at stake. Sometimes this requires you to work with high-powered faculty members and administrators with their own agendas, or people with difficult personalities. It is all part of the diplomacy of the job, and it is a sure place of personal leadership growth. Remember, it is not about your own success, it is about the success of your unit as a whole. Where will you go from here? Thank goodness I no longer need to be promoted! I have been fortu - nate to keep my research group active during my years as ISR director. One benefit of the position is that I have been exposed to the breadth and depth of the research we conduct here. It has broadened the per - spective I bring to my own research. I plan to steer my research group in a way that will be in tune with and focused on real societal, systems- oriented challenges, specifically in health care. It would be foolish not to take advantage of these experiences and bring them forward! My advice to everyone is to use what you have learned, technically and otherwise, in your next step .

CONSOLIA. JAMES CLARK SCHOOL of ENGINEERING GLENN L. MARTIN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY3Bill Regli named sixth director of ISR Clark School Dean Darryll Pines has named William Regli as the sixth director of the Institute for Systems Research, beginning in January 2018. Regli, an ISR alumnus, received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Maryland in 1995. He was advised by Professor Dana Nau (CS/ISR). \"It truly is exciting to have Bill return to ISR in a leadership role, \" said current ISR Director Reza Ghodssi . \"I am sure under Bill's leadership ISR will continue to innovate, grow, and have an even greater research impact, both within the university and the nation.\" Regli, on leave from the Computer Science Department at Drexel University, has been with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) since 2014 and presently serves in the role of Acting Director of the Defense Sciences Office. During his time at DARPA, Regli led initiatives in advanced robotics, design and manufacturing, social systems, machine learn - ing and human-machine teaming. His previous research spans a range of technical areas; most recently he has been focused on advancing the use of lightweight semantic models to solve problems in content- centric networking, metadata extraction and labeling, and supply-chain interoperability. As professor of computer and information science and senior asso - ciate dean for research in the College of Computing and Informatics at Drexel University, he led Drexel's pursuit of the FAA Center of Excellence in Unmanned Air Systems and several successful technology transitions to the defense and public sectors (including two commercial spin outs and six patents). He also had leading roles in efforts to apply advanced computing and cyber-infrastructure to challenges in design and manufacturing. Regli also has held positions with Lockheed Martin's Advanced T echnology Labs, A T&T Laboratories, and Carnegie Mellon University. In addition to DARPA, his government service includes time with the National Institute of Standards and T echnology as well as a scientific adviser role for the U .S. Department of Energy in the Defense Programs Office of the National Nuclear Security Administration. He is a life member of AAAI, ACM and Sigma Xi; a Senior Member of AAAI and ACM; and was recently named a Fellow of the IEEE Computer Society in 2017 for his \"contributions to 3D search, design repositories and intelligent manufacturing.'' \"I'm thrilled to be returning to Maryland, \" Regli said. \"This is a very special homecoming for me: from DARPA, which supported my work as a graduate student, to the Institute for Systems Research. Thanks to the stewardship of Reza Ghodssi, ISR is in a fantastic posi - tion to play a central role in the intellectual life of the campus during this exciting time in the life of the university and the Clark School.\"Michael Rotkowitz is PECASE Award recipient On Jan. 9, President Barack Obama named Assistant Professor Michael Rotkowitz (ECE/ ISR) one of 102 recipi - ents of the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE). This is the highest honor bestowed by the federal government on science and engineering professionals in the early stages of their inde - pendent research careers. The awardees come not only from academia but also from federal labs and agencies. Rotkowitz's award was one of 19 that were nominated by the National Science Foundation. In his statement announcing the awards, President Obama said, \"These innovators are working to help keep the United States on the cutting edge, showing that federal investments in science lead to advancements that expand our knowledge of the world around us and contribute to our economy.\" The PECASE allows Rotkowitz to continue his research in the decentralized implementable control of massively interconnected sys - tems. The world is becoming increasingly dependent on complex inter - connected systems, such as smart building management, multi-vehicle systems and convoys, irrigation networks, large array telescopes, and the power distribution grid. The advent of these systems has created a need to design and analyze controllers that can observe information from only a small portion of a network but may ultimately affect a large portion of the network. This is a key challenge in many problems con - nected to cyber-physical systems. Conventional controls analysis assumes that one centralized deci - sion-maker can access all available measurements, and determine the usage of all possible means of actuation. Most methods of design and analysis are extremely fragile to this assumption, and break down when such centralization is not possible or is not desired, leading to the field of decentralized control. Radhakisan Baheti, NSF program director in the NSF Directorate for Engineering, said, \"Decentralized decision making and control has been one of the challenging and open problems in dynamical systems for over 40 years. Michael Rotkowitz has made pioneering contribu - tions in the decentralized implementable control of massively intercon - nected systems. His work has been cited by over 1,200 researchers and has led to new insights and several important results. Michael has also contributed to the education of undergraduate and high school stu - dents using innovative engineering testbeds.\" CREDIT: AL SANTOS4 SYSTEM SOLUTIONS FALL 2017Maryland's reACT house takes second place at Solar Decathlon The University of Maryland's reACT solar house took second place overall and first place among U .S. competitors in the U .S. Department of Energy's Solar Decathlon in Denver this October. First place went to a Swiss team representing four universities. The event challenged 12 collegiate teams from around the world to design and build energy- efficient, solar-powered houses. Professor Ray Adomaitis (ChBE/ISR) was one of the faculty mentors working with the Maryland team. In addition, the ISR finance unit staff provided the team with procurement services throughout the Solar Decathlon's two-year process. The reACT (resilient Adaptive Climate T echnology) house was designed by an inter - disciplinary team of students and included a hydroponic garden, \"living walls\" in its court - yard, predictive automation and design ele - ments that will simplify future upgrades. The home's mechanical core features a high-perfor - mance, interactive, environmentally sensitive automated system. A solar oven in the attic can heat water, dry clothes, and dehydrate and cook food. Maryland has competed in three Solar Decathlons. Its W aterShed house won first place in 2011, and the university placed sec - ond in both 2007 and 2017. The Solar Decathlon process\u2014in which teams move from concept drawings to the construction of a physical house\u2014culminates in a nine-day, 10-contest competition in a \"solar village\" built especially for the event. The reACT house was built on campus in College Park, then partially disassembled and trucked cross-country to Colorado, where it was reassembled in the village along with the houses of other contestants. Competitions included evaluations of each home's performance, design, sustainabil - ity, and market appeal. This is the first year teams are eligible for cash prizes; Maryland brought home $225,000. Maryland's team includes students from the A. James Clark School of Engineering, the School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation, the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources, the College of Education, and programs in several other disciplines across campus. The reACT house has returned to cam - pus, where it will continue to be used as a research and education center. \u2014 Thanks to Melissa Andrechek and Chris Hinojosa for the original reporting.

The company has been awarded a $2.3 million Fast T rack National Institutes of Health National Cancer Institute Small Business Innovation Research contract for the project. Otomagnetics began in Professor Benja\u00ad min Shapiro' s (BioE/ISR) laboratory, collaborations with Research Scientist Didier Depireux , and with co-found - ers Dr. Irving W einberg and David Beylin. \"W e are honored and excited to be work - ing closely with NIH to address this pressing clinical need, \" said Shapiro, the company's presi - dent and CEO. \"There shouldn't have to be a choice between effective chemo and lifelong hearing loss. Our technology has the potential to allow treatment by chemotherapy without the attendant risk of hearing loss.\" Platin-based chemotherapy drugs, such as cisplatin and carboplatin, can cause significant hearing loss, particularly in children. This can have a dramatic impact on subsequent qual - ity of life and lead to substantial cognitive and speech development deficits in pediatric cases. Otomagnetics' drug delivery technique will enable application of a topical therapy to the ear's cochlea to prevent the toxins' dam - age. Pre-clinical studies have shown that mag - netic delivery even of a common off-the-shelf anti-inflammatory steroid can substantially reduce hearing loss from cisplatin regimens, and magnetic delivery of newly-emerging therapies could provide an even greater benefit. Furthermore, topical and non-invasive magnetic delivery of a small dose of an otoprotective drug to the cochlea would not interfere with the intended systemic anti-tumor action of the chemotherapy. \" A lot of progress has been made recently in understanding the causes and mechanisms that lead to hearing loss, tinnitus and balance disorders and what should be done to reverse these, \" Depireux said. \"But getting drugs, genes and their carriers to the inner ear and the inner ear only, in humans, remains a mostly unsolved A. JAMES CLARK SCHOOL of ENGINEERING GLENN L. MARTIN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY5Baras wins IEEE Simon Ramo Medal; AACC Richard E. Bellman Control Heritage Award In 2016, Professor John Baras (ECE/ ISR) received two major professional awards and was named an associate fel - low of a professional society. Baras received the American Automatic Control Council's (AACC) 2017 Richard E. Bellman Control Heritage Award, which he accepted at the 2017 American Control Conference Awards Ceremony in May. The Bellman Award is given for distinguished career contributions to the theory or application of automatic control and is the highest AACC recog - nition of professional achievement for U .S. control systems engineers and scientists. The citation reads, \"For innovative contribu - tions to control theory, stochastic systems, and networks and academic leadership in systems and control.\" Baras also was the recipient of the 2017 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers' (IEEE) Simon Ramo Medal, given \"for exceptional achievement in sys - tems engineering and systems science.\" Baras accepted the medal at the 2017 IEEE Honors Ceremony Gala, part of the IEEE Vision Innovation Challenges Summit event, in May. The citation reads, \"For exceptional con - tributions to the conception and commercial - ization of Internet-over-satellite systems, and for leadership in model-based engineering, sys - tems science and engineering research.\" This is one of the major IEEE-wide med - als, and is the highest IEEE-wide recogni - tion for exceptional achievement in systems engineering and systems science. It was estab - lished in 1982 and is named in honor of the distinguished engineering contributions of Dr. Simon Ramo, former vice chairman of the board and chairman of the executive com - mittee of TRW , Inc. The award consists of a gold medal, bronze replica, certificate, and an honorarium. It is sponsored by Northrop Grumman Corp. In the event program, IEEE noted: Recognized worldwide as a visionary leader of systems engineering, John Baras' develop - ment, commercialization and advancement of Internet-over-satellite (IoS) systems created a new industry that is bringing fast Internet services to tens of millions of people who may otherwise not have access. Baras also provided innovations for secure operation of IoS, such as layered encryption security, which has become an international standard. As founding director of the University of Maryland's Institute for Systems Research (ISR), Baras has championed the development of model-based systems engineering (MBSE) with a foundational framework that has been successfully applied to industrial applications. He has demonstrated MBSE methodologies to be essential for addressing challenges in software- intensive systems; modular product develop - ment in the automotive, aerospace and energy industries; cyber-physical systems; and smart manufacturing. In addition, in October Baras was named an Associate Fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA). AIAA Associate Fellows are individuals of dis - tinction who have made notable and valuable contributions to the arts, sciences, or technol - ogy of aeronautics or astronautics. Learn more.

Even if you can hear the other person, understanding what they're saying can be difficult. Such everyday communication requires a coordinated effort between the ears and the brain. Frustratingly, most available devices designed to enhance hearing, such as hearing aids, increase the vol - ume of incoming sounds without increasing the clarity, especially in noisy environments. The National Institute on Aging, part of the National Institutes of Health, has awarded more than $8 million to the University of Maryland to develop an approach for address - ing hearing loss and communication challeng - es that affect millions of older people. The goal of this project is to improve speech understanding in challenging condi - tions for older listeners, focusing on the use of training programs rather than devices like hearing aids or cochlear implants. These train - ing programs are designed to target the parts of the brain, both auditory and cognitive neural systems, that are critical for successful speech understanding in challenging condi - tions but that degrade with age. Five ISR faculty are part of the effort: Professor Shihab Shamma (ECE/ISR), Professor Jonathan , ISR Didier Depireux and ISR-affiliated Professor Patrick Kanold (Biology).challenge. W e are working to address that challenge.\" The new device acts like a syringe that uses non-invasive magnetic forces instead of a needle to safely and effectively deliver therapy to hard-to-reach targets. The company plans to use funding support to help the system progress through Food and Drug Administration mile - stones so it can eventually reach patients. Otomagnetics also is developing magnetic delivery to reach middle ear and eye targets, enabling treatment of other conditions.SYSTEM SOLUTIONS FALL 2017 6 Kanold: Autism may begin early in brain development Autism is not a single condition, but a spec - trum of disorders that affect the brain's ability to perceive and process information. Recent research suggests that too many con - nections in the brain could be at least par - tially responsible for the symptoms of autism, from communication deficits to unusual talents. New research from ISR-affiliated Professor Patrick Kanold's (Biology) research group published in the journal Cell Reports suggests that this overload of con - nections begins early in mammalian develop - ment, when key neurons in the brain region known as the cerebral cortex begin to form their first circuits. By pinpointing where and when autism-related neural defects first emerge in mice, the study results could lead to a stronger understanding of autism in humans\u2014including possible early interven - tion strategies. The work suggests that the neural pathology of autism manifests in the earliest cortical circuits, formed by a cell type called subplate neurons. No one has looked at developing circuits this early, in this level of detail, in the context of autism before. \"Our results suggest that we might have to interfere quite early to address autism, \" Kanold said. \"The fetal brain is not just a small adult brain, and these subplate neurons are the major difference. There may, in fact, be other developmental disorders we can tackle using this information. This is truly a new discovery and potentially represents a new paradigm for autism research.\" \u2014 Story by Matthew Wright, UMD College of Computer, Mathematics and Natural Sciences Learn more.

SecondW rite LLC is a Phase II, NSF SBIR-funded company with a next-generation sand - box that detects advanced malware including APT s, targeted attacks and zero-day evasions that defeat other solutions. Its patent-pending technology identifies hidden paths in malware and forcibly executes them, achieving complete code coverage. It also can detect sophisticated anti- analysis malware that cannot be detected by other solutions, using deep program introspection. ISR faculty part of three NSF neural and cognitive systems awards ISR researchers are part of three grants in the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Integrative Strategies for Understanding Neural and Cognitive Systems program awards. Professor Jonathan Simon (ECE/Biology/ISR) and ISR-affiliated Assistant Professor Behtash Babadi (ECE) have received a $900,000 grant for research that will take advantage of recent technological advances in noninvasive neuroimaging to learn more about how the brain's neural mechanisms work in adaptive auditory processing. \"Extracting Functional Cortical Network Dynamics at High Spatiotemporal Resolution\" will use modern signal processing techniques to combine high temporal resolution, non-invasive recordings with high spatial resolutions. \"Our work will bring new insight as to the dynamic organization of cortical networks at unprecedented spatiotemporal resolutions, and can thereby impact technology in the areas of brain-computer interfacing and neuromorphic engineering, \" says Babadi. \"It also will allow for the creation of engineering solutions for early detection and monitoring of cognitive disorders involving auditory perception and attention.\" ISR-affiliated Professor Cynthia Moss ( Johns Univers Assistant Research JHU Professor Rajat Mittal received $948,000 in funding for \" Active Listening and Attention in 3D Natural Scenes.\" The work leverages innovative engineering tools, cutting-edge neuroscience methods and neuroethological modeling to pursue a multidisciplinary investigation of dynamic feedback between 3D scene representation, attention and action-selection. Associate Professor Sarah Bergbreiter (ME/ISR) and two colleagues from Northwestern University, Professor L. Catherine Brinson and Professor Mitra Hartmann, were awarded a $1 million grant to better understand how animals gather information through the sense of touch and then use this information to perform complex behaviors. At Maryland, Bergbreiter will be developing artificial, modular, reconfigurable whiskers that imitate the functions of ani - mal whiskers. The University of Maryland's portion of the grant is $320,000. These NSF awards have been issued to U .S. cross-disciplinary teams to conduct innova - tive research focused on neural and cognitive systems. The awards contribute to NSF's invest - ments in fundamental brain research, in particular support of Understanding the Brain and the BRAIN Initiative, a coordinated research effort that seeks to accelerate the development of new neurotechnologies. \"It takes insight and courage to tackle these problems, \" said Ken Whang, NSF program director in the Computer and Information Science and Engineering Directorate. \"These teams are combining their expertise to try to forge new paths forward on some of the most complex and important challenges of understanding the brain. They are posing problems in new ways, taking intellectual and technical risks that have huge potential payoff.\"7 A. JAMES CLARK SCHOOL of ENGINEERING GLENN L. MARTIN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY Espy-Wilson technology in new Alcatel MOVE TIME smart watch OmniSpeech LLC's OmniClearTM technology is included in the latest Alcatel MOVE TIME smart watch. Omni Speech, found ed by Professor Carol Espy \u00adWilson (ECE/ISR), delivers superior voice quality in communi - cation devices through proprietary speech enhancement and noise reduction software. The MOVE TIME smart watch is a wearable device for active people. In addition to fitness tracking, email and SMS function - ality, users can make and receive phone calls. That's where OmniSpeech comes in. \"Our technology is being employed in Alcatel's MOVE TIME smart watch to enable high-quality voice communications, \" says Espy- Wilson. The technology has the potential to add significant, game-changing performance value to every phone, hearing aid, computer and car in the world. The distinct, single-microphone Omni- ClearTM software reduces dynamic noise in communication devices, performing on par with competing dual-microphone solutions. In addition to enhancing speech, OmniClearTM lowers the volume of noise, which is often distorted by other solutions. These advantages come from proprietary technology, which leverages decades of research on speech production, acoustics and perception. The OmniClearTM software focuses on speech first. \"Our algor - ithm knows what speech looks like. It has specific char- acter istics, \" Espy- Wilson explains. \"W e use subtraction tech - niques and what is special about speech to rec - ognize the speech signal and reduce everything that is not speech.\" Espy-Wilson developed OmniSpeech's technology at the University of Maryland. She received an Invention of the Y ear Award from the University of Maryland Office of T echnology Commercialization in 2010 for the technology, which the university later licensed to OmniSpeech.Flocks and form Picture a flock of birds in the sky\u2014a migrating cohort of geese, a patch of swifts, or a murmura - tion of starlings. Y ou notice patterns and chang - ing forms\u2014a one-dimensional undulating rope of geese, or a 3D deformable solid suggested by a point cloud of starlings. The imagined solid may rotate as a whole and change orientation, scale, density, or transform from an ellipsoid to something more elaborate in the blink of an eye. Can one provide effective descriptions of form, and suggest ways to capture the essential kinematic modes that govern transformations of form? Questions along similar lines had been posed and explored by chemists. Molecules of matter display symmetries in the configuration of individual atoms held together by chemical bonds. For instance, each molecule of the green - house gas Methane (CH4) has four Hydrogen atoms occupying the vertices of a platonic solid, the tetrahedron, and a Carbon atom located at the dead center. But this is a nominal structure which is subject to vibrations (hence change of shape) and rigid motions, as thermal energy is absorbed from and re-emitted to the environ - ment\u2014the domain of infra-red molecular spec - troscopy. Quantum mechanics governs the fre - quencies of modes of vibration; in general there are 3n-6 such modes in a molecule made up of n atoms. Vibration co-exists with rotation and attempts at decoupling them failed, and as we now know thanks to the insights of mathemati - cian Alain Guichardet, for reasons that lie in the geometry of fiber bundles (spaces with a certain local product structure). One difficulty with the chemists' tools lies in the high dimension of the shape space of a complex molecule, thus rendering them un wieldy for tackling large flocks. In \"Geo - metric decompositions of collective motion, \" appearing April 26 in the Proceedings of the Royal Society A , the authors devise a new fiber bundle structure to describe the changing forms of flocks and underlying kinematic modes. The journal website includes supplementary mate - rial that provides details on how the concept of ensemble inertia tensor described by just six parameters, is the key to the new structure. Under certain generic conditions, flock data can be factored into such a tensor and coordinates on a Stiefel manifold, a space that has played an important role in various areas of mathematics and applied science. The modes are arrived at in a principled manner via modern tools from the field of differential geometry. Using notions of energy attributed to various types of col - lective movement, the authors shed new light on data obtained by previous researchers from small flocks of pigeons in free flight over large distances. The paper was written by Howard Hughes Medical Institute Janelia Research Campus Scientist Matteo Mischiati (EE Ph.D. 2011), and University of Maryland Professor P. S. Krishnaprasad (ECE/ISR). The top-down approach of this paper complements their ear - lier collaboration based on the abstraction of agents in a collective as self-steering particles interacting according to strategies such as mutu - al motion camouflage. The mathematics of fiber bundles under - lying this paper has roots in twentieth century efforts to build new geometric foundations for physics, guided by the pioneers Elie Cartan and Charles Ehresmann. The authors use the kinetic energy quadratic form to construct velocity splittings, or connections in the sense of Ehresmann, that pave the way for comput - ing kinematic modes of a flocking event. There are other threads that suggest steps to exploit the analytical tools of this paper in synthesizing algorithms for motion planning for collectives of robots. A different concern for the biologist may be posed: Just as spectroscopic read-outs provide chemical signatures of molecules in a sample being interrogated, could one speculate that energy splits amongst kinematic modes in the course of a flocking event yield some tell-tale signatures of the event? Further experience in analyzing large flock data may help answer this question.ENSEMBLE INERTIA TENSOR OF A COLLECTIVE (POINT CLOUD) VISUALIZED AS AN ELLIPSOID LOCATED AT THE CENTER OF MASS (FIGURE 1 OF PAPER; COPYRIGHT ROYAL SOCIETY) 8 SYSTEM SOLUTIONS FALL 2017New grants Fritz, Shamma part of $8.5M DARPA Targeted Neuro- plasticity Training Program ISR Research Scientist Jonathan Fritz and Professor Shihab Shamma (ECE/ISR) are research collaborators in a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) T argeted Neuroplasticity T raining program to study the effect of peripheral nerve stimulation on sec - ond language acquisition and brain plasticity. The University of Maryland will receive up to $8.58 million from DARPA for the research. Led by researchers from the Center for Advanced Study of Language (CASL), the project seeks to examine whether stimulating the vagnal nerve improves adults' brain plastic - ity to help them learn a second language. The principal investigators are Henk Haarmann, Stefanie Kuchinsky, neuroscientists at CASL. Fritz, Shamma, and Jamie Tyler from Arizona State University's School of Biological and Health Systems Engineering are additional researchers. The researchers will use behavioral and neuroimaging methods to examine the effects of vagnal nerve stimulation (VNS) on audi - tory, acoustic, and speech perception learning, vocabulary and grammar learning for written language, and short- and long-term neuroplas - ticity in the brain. The stimulation is delivered via an earbud that transmits a safe, low-voltage electrical signal to a peripheral branch of the vagal nerve. The research team will map the dynamic neural networks activated during VNS and learning. Studies on auditory learning will address the neural basis for enhanced neuro - plasticity with vagal nerve stimulation, which leads to the targeted release of neuromodula - tors that improve the brain systems for atten - tion, learning and memory. Ulukus is PI for new NSF information-theoretic physi - cal layer security grant Professor Sennur Ulukus (ECE/ISR) is the principal investigator for a three year, $500,000 National Science Foundation (NSF) grant: \" Alignment for Secrecy: One-Time- Pads in the Air without Keys.\" This research will advance information-theoretic physical layer security to address practical issues aris - ing from user misbehavior, conflicting user interests, and a lack of complete network state information. Practically implementable codes will be devised. Ulukus will investigate deviat - ing users who do not follow agreed-upon opti - mum protocols, as well as combat helpers and selfish users who have conflicting interests. It also will address vector channels arising from use of multiple antennas and associated chan - nel state information issues, as well as explicit code design using polar codes and relating polar alignment and signal alignment. ISR researchers win 2017 BBI seed grants ISR researchers are involved in three of the nine seed grants announced by the University of Maryland's Brain and Behavior Initiative for fiscal year 2017. The program promotes col - laborations among faculty from research areas that are traditionally exclusive. Professor Pamela Abshire (ECE/ISR) and Professor Jonathan Simon (ECE/ISR/ Biology) will be working with Karen Bradley (Dance), Adrianne Fang (Theatre) and B rad Hatfield (Kinesiology) on the project, \"Dance and EEG: Neural correlates of expressive movement.\" Research Scientist Jonathan Fritz (ISR) and Bill Idsardi (LING) are teaming for \"New representations in neuronal ensembles during initial language acquisition.\" ISR-affiliated Professor Patrick Kanold (Biology) and Joshua Singer (Biology) will explore \"Control of cross-modal sensory plas - ticity ganglion cells.\" Ghodssi, Bentley receive NSF EAGER grant for medi - cal diagnosis capsules ISR Director Reza Ghodssi (ECE/ISR) is the principal investigator and William Bentley (BioE) is the co-PI for a two-year, $150,000 NSF Early Concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) grant, \"Gut-Nav: A Gut Navigator for Real-Time Diagnostic Reporting on Gastro-Intestinal Health.\" This research will demonstrate a new generation of ingestible capsules for region-tar - geted in situ detection of GI analytes. T argeted applications include pancreatic adenocarci -noma screening and inflammatory bowel dis - ease. While capsule technologies do exist, no swallowable technology is currently available that allows for sensing of specific biomolecular analytes within targeted regions inside the gut. The proposed system could serve as a plat - form for a variety of other sensing applications and could inform the development of smaller ingestible or implantable systems for use with - in the body. Schonfeld, Ryzhov win NSF EAGER grant Professor Paul Schonfeld (CEE) is the prin - cipal investigator and Associate Professor Ilya Ryzhov the for a new one-year, $150,000 NSF EAGER grant, \"Optimization with Data Acquisition in T ransportation Engineering.\" The work looks to determine the amount of data that should be purchased for statisti - cally estimating the coefficients of optimiza - tion models. The researchers will examine the tradeoffs between the cost of data used for cal - ibrating optimization models and the quality of solutions obtained with those models. Such tradeoffs will be explored mainly for problems relevant in transportation, such as vehicle assignment to tasks, vehicle routing, fleet siz - ing, and network flow models. The results should help transportation agencies and com - panies across the world allocate resources and improve their professional practice. Beyond transportation problems, this work may yield methods that would be valuable in other appli - cations, industries and disciplines, including engineering, operations research, economics and management. CoolCAD receives NASA contract The National Aeronautics and Space Admin - istration (NASA) has awarded CoolCAD Electronics, LLC, a $750,000 Phase II Small Business Innovative Research contract.

Because the world is awash with data obtained from numerous and varied pro - cesses, there is a need for appropriate sta - tistical methods, which in general produce improved inference by taking as input the information from many sources. This book comes up with estimates or decisions based on multiple data sources as opposed to more narrowly defined estimates or decisions based on single data sources. Professor Jonathan Simon (ECE/ISR/Biology) is one of the editors of The Auditory System at the Cocktail Party, published by Springer. In addition to Simon, the editors include John Middlebrooks, Arthur Popper and Richard Fay. The book points to the seri - ous challenge faced by listeners in everyday environments: how to hear sounds of interest amid a cacophony of competing sounds. The volume presents the mechanisms for bottom- up object formation and top-down object selection that the auditory system employs to meet that challenge.

She follows Associate Professor Sarah Bergbreiter (ME/ISR) in the position. The Maryland Robotics Center is an interdisciplinary research center housed in ISR within the Clark School. Its research activities include all aspects of robotics, including development of component technologies (e.g., sen - sors, actuators, structures, and communication), novel robotic platforms, and intelligence and autonomy for robot - ic systems. Research projects in the center are supported by federal funding agencies including NSF, ARO, ARL, ONR, AFOSR, NIH, DARPA, NASA, and NIST.REU program in bio-inspired robotics As described on the previous page, NSF REU programs are summer residential programs that provide undergraduates with collaborations for solving challenges and encourage them toward future research careers in industry or academia. The REU in bioinspired robotics offers a truly interdisciplin - ary systems research challenge that encompasses biology, materials, mechanical design, control, sensors and actuators, power and elec - tronics. Professor Hugh Bruck (ME) is the principal investigator and Associate Professor Sarah Bergbreiter (ME/ISR) is the co-PI. Both are faculty in the Maryland Robotics Center. Projects include cube satellite scale dexterous manipulators; dynamic morphing wings for flapping wing MAV; determining fac - tors casing flow of propylene carbonate in millimeter scale channels; heavy leg inverted pendulum model for milligram-scale quadrupedal robot locomotion; compliant touch sensing skins for collaborative mechanism designs in a mobile Helmholtz coil system; quadcopter lateral thrust control; the effects of mass, stiffness, and geometry on wing performance for Robo Raven; soft robots; an efficient periodic gait for the starfish robot; and actuation of acoustic metamaterials for biomimetic robotic applications.

Many options for systems engineering graduate education ISR offers a number of ways to obtain graduate education in sys - tems engineering through our partnership with the Clark School of Engineering. There are two systems engineering masters degrees: the Master of Science in Systems Engineering (MSSE) and the Master of Engineering in Systems Engineering (MEngSE). The college also offers a Graduate Certificate in Engineering (CGEN) in Systems Engineering. Students in both the MSSE and MEngSE programs take the same Maryland Robotics Center provides students with multiple education and research opportunities six core courses, but there are differences in admission requirements, electives and tuition. ISR administers the MSSE , a research-oriented degree that requires completion of 30 credits (usually 10 courses). The student may opt to produce either a master's thesis or scholarly paper that reflects their systems engineering-related research. Students work under the guidance of a faculty advisor on a topic of mutual interest. Full-time students enrolled in this program are eligible for graduate research assis - tantships (GRAs), MSSE-specific internships, and possibly teaching assistantships (T As). This degree program is particularly well-suited to students who are interested in research and who may be consider - ing the possibility of pursuing a Ph.D. in an engineering-related field. In-state tuition rates for the MSSE program are lower than those for the MEngSE program, which makes the degree attractive for Maryland residents. The MEngSE is a professional degree offered through the Clark School's Office of Advanced Engineering Education. It requires com - pletion of 30 credits (usually 10 courses) and does not require either a master's thesis or scholarly paper. It is particularly well-suited for work - ing professionals who are likely to be taking only one or two courses a semester. Students enrolled in this program are not eligible to be GRAs or T As, or to receive MSSE-specific internships. Since the MEngSE tuition is lower than out-of-state MSSE tuition, international and out- of-state students may find this program more attractive. If a student in either of the masters programs and decides to switch to the other program, they may apply to the other program. If accepted, any core systems engineering courses they have taken will transfer to the other program. Credit for electives will be evaluated with respect to the policies of each program. Admission and degree requirements for each program may be found on their respective websites. The CGEN in Systems Engineering , offered through the Clark School's Office of Advanced Engineering Education, requires comple - tion of four approved courses (12 credits total). It is designed for engi - neering professionals who would like to obtain added credentials in systems engineering.

MARTIN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY15Maryland part of Advanced Robotics Manufacturing Institute The University of Maryland is among 231 academic, industry and government partners in the new Advanced Robotics Manufacturing Institute (ARM). ARM is headquartered at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh and has received $80 million from the U .S. Department of Defense and an additional $173 million from other funding sources. At Maryland, ARM efforts are led by the Maryland Robotics Center. \"Maryland brings a particularly strong group of research - ers in the area of perception and sensors for collaborative robotics, \" says Associate Professor Sarah Bergbreiter (ME/ISR). \"In addition, Maryland contributes state of-the-art facilities and educational oppor - tunities to train the next generation of robot developers.\" The use of robotics in manufacturing is widespread, but robots are typically expensive, singularly purposed, challenging to reprogram, and require isolation from humans for safety. In addition, while robots are increasingly necessary for defense and other industrial manufacturing needs, their capital cost and complexity of use limits their use by mid- size and small manufacturers. ARM will make industrial robotics more affordable for businesses of all sizes, adaptable for many uses, and able to achieve more. ARM will create a new generation of robots in the aerospace, automotive, electronics, fulfillment and logistics industries, creating large numbers of new jobs in the U .S. and to fuel the country's economic growth through advanced manufacturing.Robotic tactile sensors featured on journal cover Research by Associate Professor Sarah Bergbreiter (ME/ISR) and her for - mer student Alexi Chara lambides (M.E.
