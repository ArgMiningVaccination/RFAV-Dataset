Acupressure: The Basics The body has more than 2,000 acupuncture points that create an energy flow throughout the body. Disrupting this energy flow can lead to ailments and diseases. By applying pressure to these points, your massage technician can improve the energy flow, promoting health and wellness. Some people confuse acupressure with acupuncture. While acupuncture uses needles to stimulate the acupoints, acupressure takes a softer approach by applying pressure with the fingertips.

Acupressure is a form of massage that targets specific points in the body, known as acupuncture points. Massaging these points can assist the free flow of energy in the channels throughout the body. It can relieve pain, digestive issues, tension, nausea, and symptoms of many common disorders. Is acupressure as good as acupuncture? Acupressure and acupuncture are similar treatments that target acupuncture points. The main difference is that acupuncture uses needles and acupressure uses pressure from the technician's fingers. Acupressure is best for general pain and tension relief, while acupuncture may be better for acute medical conditions. How often should you do acupressure? You should complete maintenance acupressure sessions at least once per month. Many people practice acupressure multiple times per day to relieve tension and stress. If you experience ongoing pain and tension, you may benefit from visiting an acupressure spa several times per week. Can I do acupressure on myself? Once you understand the basics of acupressure, you can perform this treatment on yourself. However, you'll experience more relief having a trained professional massage your acupuncture points instead. Using the right level of pressure is key to obtaining the best benefits from this treatment.
