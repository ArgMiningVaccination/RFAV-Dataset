Each researcher is passionate about saving lives and improving the health of cancer survivors. We only accept the best of the best applications - Cancer Council works in partnership with the National Health and Medical Research Council every year to conduct a rigorous peer-review process of all projects. These research projects make up a fraction of over $20 million which is invested into cancer research every year because of our supporters, so thank you. Prof Robin Anderson Prof Robin Anderson Olivia Newton-John Cancer Centre Research Institute | 2019-2021 | Breast cancer This study aims to reduce the likelihood of breast cancer spreading to other areas of the body. \"I am in the demographic that is most likely to develop breast cancer and have friends and family living with or having died from this disease.\" - Prof Anderson Dr James Dowty University of Melbourne | 2019-2020 | Colon cancer This study applies a new statistical method of searching DNA 'marks' (currently used in breast cancer) to understand the hereditary risk of colon cancer. \"It is very morally satisfying to contribute to the global fight against cancer in a way that will benefit future cancer patients.\" - Dr Dowty Prof. Thomas Gebhardt University of Melbourne | 2019-2021 | Skin cancer Professor Gebhardt's study will enhance our understanding of how to harness our immune system to fight melanoma. \"I feel that we are only a very few steps away from making immunotherapies even more efficacious and safer.\" - Prof. Gebhardt Dr Simon Keam Dr Simon Keam Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre | 2019-2021 | Prostate cancer This study on prostate cancer will improve radiation therapy by understanding why some patients develop a resistance to it. \"Eliminating the source of pain, distress, and needless loss is at the heart of why I undertake cancer research.\" - Dr Keam Prof. Matt Watt University of Melbourne | 2019-2021 | Prostate cancer Professor Watt is further investigating prostate cancer treatments which slow tumour progression and improve patients' prognosis. \"Given my expertise in metabolism and experience in research, I feel compelled to find ways to slow this disease.\" - Prof. Watt Prof. Louise Purton St Vincent's Institute of Medical Research | 2019-2021 | Leukaemia This project is an initial study of specific drugs that show promise for treating myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), which can lead to leukaemia. \"There is a need to identify better treatments for patients with MDS to provide them with a chance for a cure.\" - Prof. Purton Prof. John Mariadason Olivia Newton-John Cancer Centre Research Institute | 2019-2021 | Bowel cancer Professor Mariadson is building on previous studies of how some bowel cancer cells grow and spread, in order to develop a new treatment. \"My motivation is to use my knowledge and experience to reduce the suffering of cancer patients by developing new, meaningful treatments.\" - Prof. Mariadason Investing in low survival cancers Dr Lorraine O'Reilly Dr Lorraine O'Reilly Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research | 2019-2021 | Stomach cancer This study looks at improving a therapy for stomach cancer by addressing its severe side-effects. \"I have had many family members succumb to cancer and related diseases. Most influential was the death of my cousin at the age of 16.\" - Dr O'Reilly Prof. Andrew Scott La Trobe University | 2019-2020 | Brain cancer Professor Scott's project aims to adapt an existing brain cancer treatment so it will also enhance patients' immune systems. \"New therapies for brain cancer are urgently required, due to the lack of treatment options and poor outcomes for many patients.\" - Prof. Scott Prof. Neil O'Brien-Simpson University of Melbourne | 2019-2021 | Oral and oesophageal cancers This project aims to improve vaccines for oral and oesophageal cancers, and in the process, could further our understanding of all cancer vaccines. \"I have, like many people, had direct experiences with cancer; family members have survived, died or are currently undergoing treatment.\" - Prof. O'Brien-Simpson Dr Lev Kats University of Melbourne | 2019-2021 | Acute Myeloid Leukaemia Dr Kats' study attempts to find more effective therapies for targeting Acute Myeloid Leukaemia by building on previous studies. \"My goal in the long term is to make significant contributions that will be of benefit to public health in Australia and worldwide.\" - Dr Kats [Three additional projects](/about/media-releases/2019-media-releases/february-2019/research-for-new-treatments-with-low-survival-cancers.html) have just been announced to find better treatments for lung, gastric and oesophageal cancers. The Victorian government will fund these as part of our Forgotten Cancers Program. "}
