Ever since I identified clean toothpaste as one of the [ four products to swap first](https://www.felixinsideout.com/2018/03/28/clean-beauty-swaps-swap-these-first/) when switching to a green/non-toxic lifestyle, I've gotten questions about the rest of the non-toxic oral hygiene routine. So today I'm going all in. Let's talk a little Ayurveda, a little hippy, and a whole lotta fresh breath. Why Non-toxic Oral Hygiene? Girl... digestion begins in your mouth. And for oral hygiene absorption starts in your mouth. So, please think about what you're putting in there. Research (and lots of it) has [linked oral disease to systemic disease](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC88948/). I'm talking Alzheimer's, stroke, heart disease, and diabetes. Um, no thank you! Also, the [oral microbiome protects you](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4346134/) from deadly viruses and bacteria in the environment. Let's help it do its job, ok? Here's how we get down. Tongue Scraper You need to be scraping your damn tongue. I mean, just do it. It's not scary, and it is an oral hygiene game changer. If you ever notice a white (or yellow) film on your tongue, then you need to tongue scrape. But even if you don't, practicing Jihwa Prakshalana, the Ayurvedic self-care ritual known as tongue scraping, is beneficial to everyone. This oral hygiene practice removes bacteria, food detritus, fungi, toxins, and dead cells from the surface of the tongue. Also, there is [research](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15341360) to show that a tongue scraper is more effective at removing toxins and bacteria from the tongue than a toothbrush. Because, duh. Need more convincing? Tongue scraping not only removes all the gross things from your tongue that can lead to bad breath and other periodontal problems, but it also improves digestion and boosts immunity. It helps with digestion by increasing saliva production and promoting Agni (the body's digestive fire: the 3rd of five elements recognized in Ayurveda). It boots immunity by preventing toxins from reabsorbing into your body. Current Fave: Dr. Tungs stainless steel tongue scraper is the one I've been using for years, and I love that it has soft comfort grip handles. I love it because stainless steel is impervious to bacteria and it's comfortable to use. There are so many options out there, choose one that is comfortable for you. I'm currently in the market for a smaller version so I can start my 8yr old on the practice. Quick How to: It's easy. - Do it first thing. On an empty stomach. Before you oil pull, floss, or brush. - Scrape, using gentle pressure, from the back to the front. - Rinse (literally) and repeat. *I tend to scrape about 5-10 times, but continue until the tongue is clean. Coconut Oil (Pulling) You're going to think I'm a hippy... but hear me out. Oil pulling, like tongue scraping, is. not. scary. It definitely takes some getting used to, but I promise, you'll get the hang of it. Oil pulling is another ancient Ayurvedic practice. It's well documented, and there has been some research to show just how beneficial it can be. Coconut oil, specifically, is great because of its antibacterial and antimicrobial properties. According to a review in [The Journal of Ayurveda and Integrative Medicine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3131773/), Ayurvedic practitioners claim oil pulling can cure 30 different diseases, including many illnesses that have nothing to do with the mouth. Whether you think oil pulling is a cure-all or not, I can personally attest to its role in reducing mouth ulcers and whitening teeth (or rather, removing minor stains). Current Fave: Your favorite organic coconut oil that you already have around the house will work perfectly for oil pulling. I keep one container in the kitchen pantry and another in the bathroom. For travel, I often forgo oil pulling because it takes a little time and isn't the most convenient habit. But, if I'm going to be traveling for more than a week, I really like [Conscious Coconut](http://shrsl.com/12cui) because it comes in a travel-friendly tube. Quick How to: The key is to start with a few minutes and work your way up to about 15mins. - Do it immediately following tongue scraping. Or first thing if you still aren't tongue scraping. - Scoop about 1-2 tbsp (start with less) into your mouth and begin to move it around until it melts. - After about 10 seconds it should be melted. Now continue swishing all around for 5- 10- 15 mins. - Do not swallow. Do not spit down the drain. Spit into bathroom wastebasket. - Rinse. Then brush teeth as usual. Toothbrush You gotta brush. Toothbrushes are just another item in our house that we have consciously made an effort to transition to more sustainable resources. Bamboo is the worlds fastest naturally renewing resource. It's also ideal for use in toothbrushes because it has inherent anti-microbial, anti-fungal, and anti-bacterial properties. Current Fave: These [F.E.T.E (From Earth to Earth) toothbrushes](http://shrsl.com/12cvh) are 100% sustainable bamboo and have an excellent mouthfeel. The bristles are firm, and they add a pop of color to the countertop. These are also compostable, just pull the bristles out and throw those out (or recycle if you don't to compost). I adore them but use what makes you happy. Just be sure to replace every 4ish months. Toothpaste Reason for using a non-toxic version: Unfortunately, this is another daily use product that is typically riddled with no-no ingredients: PEG's, aspartame, SLS, and fluoride, to name a few. And I don't even want to get into the brands that still have triclosan, despite it being heavily researched and all but banned by the FDA. The long and short of it is, the main brand that still uses triclosan argues the good outweighs the bad. I call bullshit. Why say bye-bye to triclosan? For starters, research has associated it with both being an [endocrine disruptor](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20562219) and as putting us at a [higher risk of cancer](https://tools.niehs.nih.gov//srp/1/ResearchBriefs/PDFs/SRP_ResearchBrief_241_508.pdf). But more importantly, it is not necessary to get clean teeth and fresh breath. Current Fave: [David's Natural Toothpaste](http://shrsl.com/yfe5) is free of fluoride, SLS, and triclosan. It also happens to be cruelty-free and sustainably packaged. Add to that a great mouthfeel, and it has all the makings of a perfect toothpaste. This toothpaste is also really nice because it has a very mild minty flavor, courtesy of the real mint leaves used to make it. That's right, no artificial flavors, colors or sweeteners. Jackpot! Floss I must confess, I always forget to floss. But it's so important. In fact, many dentists believe that flossing is even more important than brushing because it removes bacteria that are the precursors of plaque. These bacteria, if not removed, will turn into tartar; and tartar is what eventually causes the damage that leads to decay and tooth loss. Basically, it's bad news bears. So, floss your teeth. Now, saying that- I still only floss my teeth once a day: at night, before bed. Don't tell my dentist. I like to tongue scrape in the morning and at night. Oil pull only in the morning. Floss only at night. If that combo doesn't cover all the bases, then I just wasn't meant to have teeth. The end. Current Fave: This may sound strange, but this [Cocofloss](http://shrsl.com/12cw1) is the best floss I've ever used. It's easy to handle, doesn't slice your fingers off when you wrap it around (tell me I'm not alone in this?), and it feels amazing around my teeth. I'm not sure what sorcery was used to create this but ask anyone who's ever used it, and they will tell you the same, this floss is amazing. Please don't think I'm crazy. HealTHY Mouth Blend This stuff is kinda magical. I mentioned last month when I was packing my toiletry bag for my trip to NYC, and I got a lot of questions about it. The Ora Wellness [HealTHY Mouth Blend](https://store.orawellness.com/collections/most-popular/products/healthy-mouth-blend) (Heal Thy? Healthy? ) is amazing. I stumbled across this brand a few years ago when looking for tooth remineralizing options and I have been so happy with it. (BTW- they also make an awesome [remineralizing tooth whitening powder](https://store.orawellness.com/collections/most-popular/products/shine-remineralizing-tooth-whitening-powder).) This blend is a mix of organic and wildcrafted essential oils in a carrier oil and can be used in a myriad of ways. This blend can be added to a few ounces of water and swished as a DIY mouthwash (how I use it with my kids) or can be added to the toothbrush for a minty, anti-bacterial boost (my preferred method). This stuff is truly amazing. Both I and my eldest are prone to mouth ulcers (usually from trauma- i.e., bumping our face or after a dental appointment) and a few drops of this blend heals them quickly. If I need it to be potent for healing an ulcer, I like to drop a few drops directly on my tongue, swish it about, and then brush my teeth and tongue as usual. Lips, too. Don't forget your lips. I like to put a thick balm on my lips during the late fall and winter. But in the warmer months, a thin layer of this [Hurraw Lemon Lip Balm](http://shrsl.com/12cut) does the trick. Hurraw lip balms are raw, vegan and gluten-free, and come in tons of delicious scents; like black cherry, vanilla bean, and coconut. This one uses cold-pressed organic Lemon Peel Oil and just the faintest amount of lemongrass. Yum! Next on my list to try is the Hurraw [Moon Lip Treatment Balm](http://shrsl.com/12cy0)-its made with vanilla, Peru balsam, and blue chamomile. Zzzzz. Did I miss anything? Have you transitioned to non-toxic oral hygiene? As always, let me know if you have any questions. Also, I know some of you have asked about the kids' routine, too. We use a few different products for our children. Be sure to check back soon; I'll do a separate post about kid-friendly oral products "}
