Your skin has a protective layer call the acid mantle that is responsible for retaining lipids and moisture while preventing the entry of germs, pollution,toxins and harmful bacteria. A healthy acid mantle on the face has several beneficial effects, including: - Moisture Retention: It helps the skin retain moisture, preventing dryness and dehydration. This leads to a smoother and more supple complexion. - Barrier Function: The acid mantle acts as a protective barrier, guarding the skin against external aggressors like pollution, toxins, and harmful bacteria. This can reduce the risk of skin infections and irritation. - pH Balance: Maintaining the correct pH level helps regulate oil production, keeping the skin from becoming too oily or too dry. Balanced pH promotes overall skin health. - Radiant Appearance: A well-maintained acid mantle contributes to a glowing and radiant complexion, as it allows the skin to function optimally and look its best. In summary, a healthy acid mantle plays a crucial role in preserving skin health and appearance by retaining moisture, protecting against external threats, maintaining the right pH balance, and promoting a radiant complexion. Frownies Face Wash aids in establishing and maintaining the proper pH ot the acid mantle. \"It feels like silk!\" When you wash your face, and your face feels so clean, but not dried out afterwards. I've paid so much more for face washes that were just marginal. Frownies face wash is my favorite now. I will definitely purchase. \"My new go to face wash!\" Love this face wash! I love that it removes make up but is gentle at the same time. The smell is amazing as well!

All our best, Frownies Customer Care I never leave reviews, truly, but I'm 35 and have struggled with acne and breakouts my whole life. I've tried countless facewashes and lotions, expensive and cheap. This one after a few days (along with the face serum) has really changed the game. I wake up each day and look at my face and I can't believe that all the bumps on my forehead and blackheads I had on my nose have slowly started to fade away! If you suffer from stress and hormonal acne like me, get this duo, worth a shot. I did the clay mask once and haven't started the frownies patches just yet, will definitely let you all know what happens. Hi there, thank you so much for your feedback.
