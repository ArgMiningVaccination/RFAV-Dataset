If you require any vaccinations relating to foreign travel you need to make an appointment with the practice nurse to discuss your travel arrangements. This will include which countries and areas within countries that you are visiting to determine what vaccinations are required. When recommended we provide free NHS travel vaccines (hepatitis A, typhoid and diptheria/tetanus/polio), other recommended non-NHS vaccines and anti-malarial tablets will need to be sought privately It is important to make this initial appointment as early as possible (at least 6 weeks prior to travelling) as a second appointment will be required with the practice nurse to receive the vaccinations. These vaccines have to be ordered as they are not a stock vaccine. Your second appointment needs to be at least 2 weeks before you travel to allow the vaccines to work. There is further information about countries and vaccinations required [available on the Fit For Travel website]and [NHS travel vaccinations].
