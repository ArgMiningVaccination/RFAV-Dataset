It's good to know which illnesses vaccines prevent, and how long until the next boosters. And how safe and effective vaccines are in preventing and transmitting disease. \"Diseases that kids are vaccinated for haven't been eradicated. It's really important we protect ourselves from them,\" says Community Health Network Family Medicine Physician [Dr. Meghan Miller](https://fad.ecommunity.com/provider/Meghan+Leanne+Miller/384949). She specializes in the health and well-being of children, recommending vaccinations including the flu shot for added protection. Over the years, vaccines have prevented countless cases of disease and saved millions of lives. [Research](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2014/p0424-immunization-program.html) suggests immunizations spare millions of children from disease \u2014 nearly 21 million hospitalizations and 732,000 deaths have been prevented. Through the Ages Age 4: Before starting pre-k or kindergarten, there are two vaccine boosters needed. The first, the MMRV booster, provides combined protection against measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox. Children at this age also receive the DTaP-IPV booster shot for diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough and polio, which is a vaccine typically given before age 1. Age 11: The next required vaccines are around middle-school age. These protect kids from tetanus, meningitis and the human papillomavirus (HPV). This common sexually transmitted infection can cause cancers later in life, including cervical cancer in women. Gardasil \u2014 the HPV vaccine \u2014 isn't required but recommended, and includes a booster six months after the first shot. If a child waits until 16, Gardasil is administered in three doses. Early HPV prevention with Gardasil is key, says Dr. Miller. \"We want to get it way before the age of 16.\" Age 16: Kids receive boosters for meningitis, and it may be recommended to receive a second vaccine against meningitis B \u2014 a strain that can cause kids to be much sicker. This is important, as older teens may be going to college or even in the military, where living in close quarters puts them at higher risk. This is an important conversation to have with your child's primary care physician. If school's starting back up for your kids, Dr. Miller suggests a well-child visit for their best overall health. She says planning in advance helps parents get a jump on back-to-school \u2014 her office becomes especially busy. Even if your child isn't due for shots, Dr. Miller recommends yearly well-child visits, even through high school when kids often need sports and activity physicals for the upcoming school year. Ready for School \"Lump in vaccines with their yearly physical exams. Then we can see how they're doing at school, at home, and address any other concerns like with eating and sleeping,\" she says. \"There are so many important things we go over at that yearly well-child visit. We'd love to see kids every year.\" On the COVID-19 Vaccine Older generations may remember the days when people hosted chicken pox parties for herd immunity. Dr. Miller said she had even heard of COVID parties during the pandemic to get natural immunity \u2014 which she doesn't advise. \"Especially with COVID, you may be the one with a mild illness and another from the same party may be on a ventilator,\" she says. \"Vaccines are the safest way to prevent yourself from illness.\" Dr. Miller says there isn't word yet on when the COVID vaccine for children under 12 will become available, but parents should stay informed and ask their doctors. She is accepting new patients on Indy's eastside. [Request a well-child visit today](https://fad.ecommunity.com/provider/Meghan+Leanne+Miller/384949). [Find Community "}
