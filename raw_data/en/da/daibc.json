AHRQ Healthcare Horizon Scanning System Status Update. (Prepared by ECRI Institute under Contract No. HHSA290 -2010 -00006 -C) Rockville, MD: Agency Quality. January 2015 . http://www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/reports/final.cfm . ii Preface The purpose of the AHRQ Healthcare Horizon Scanning System is to conduct horizon scanning of emerging health care technologies and innovations to better inform patient -centered outcomes research investments at AHRQ through the Effective Health Care Program. The Healthcare Horizon Scanning System provides AHRQ a systematic process to identify and monitor emerging technologies and innovations in health care and to create an inventory of emerging technologies that have the highest potential for impact on clinical care, the health care system, patient outcomes, and costs. It will also be a tool for the public t o identify and find information on new health care technologies and interventions. Any investigator or funder of research will be able to use the AHRQ Healthcare Horizon Scanning System to select potential topics for research. The health care technologies and innovations of interest for horizon scanning are those that have yet to diffuse into or become part of established health care practice. These health care interventions are still in the early stages of development or adoption except in the case of new applications of already -diffused technologies. Consistent with the definitions of health care interventions provided by the Institute of Medicine and the Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research, AHRQ is interested in innovations in drugs and biologics, medical devices, screening and diagnostic tests, procedures, services and programs, and care delivery. Horizon scanning involves two processes. The first is identifying and monitoring new and evolving health care interventions that are purported to or may hold potential to diagnose, treat, or otherwise manage a particular condition or to improve care delivery for a variety of conditions. The second is analyzing the relevant health care context in which these new and evolving interve ntions exist to understand their potential impact on clinical care, the health care system, patient outcomes, and costs. It is NOT the goal of the AHRQ Healthcare Horizon Scanning System to make predictions on the future use and costs of any health care te chnology. Rather, the reports will help to inform and guide the planning and prioritization of research resources. This edition of the Status Update lists interventions that have been identified and are being monitored. The next edition will be published in 2-3 months. We welcome comments on the list, which may be sent by mail to the Task Order Officer named in this report to: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 540 Gaither Road, Rockville, MD 20850, or by email to: effectivehealthcare@ahrq.hhs.gov .

More than 4 years have passed since the system was initiated. The horizon time frame focuses on identifying topic s anticipated to be within 3 years of possible diffusion into clinical practice. A few surrogates are used to determine this horizon, such as clinical investigation in phase III trials for interventions subject to regulatory processes of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Topics with FDA orphan drug status, fast -track status, or innovation pathway designation are considered if phase II trials are ongoing. For the broad priority area of \"Functional Limitations and Disability,\" AHRQ has designated u se of the definition of disability used by the Department of Health and Human Services. The Status Update is a summary of data elements collected as a result of implement ing the Horizon Scanning Identification and Monitoring Protocol. Status Update report s are produced five times a year , with each new report superseding the prior version. Th is Status Update is organized into three main topic -status sections and by priority condition within each section. The table of contents provides direct links to each se ction's priority condition tables. Topics that were already in the system for this tracking period are presented first as \"Currently Tracked Interventions ,\" followed by \"Interventions Added Since Last Update,\" and then by \"Interventions Tracked but Archive d Since Last Update\" (i.e., during the prior tracking period of 10 weeks) . Each table provides information under the following column headings: Topic Title, Potential Patient Population, Intervention Description (including the Developer/Manufacturer [s] and Phase of Development), Potential Comparators, and Potential Health or Other Impacts. Criteria for including topics in the Status Update are provided in detail in the \" Horizon Scanning Protocol and Operations Manual ,\" which is available on the Effective He alth Care Web site (Protocol and Operations Manual ). Briefly, broad scanning is performed for each priority condition to detect \"leads\" to interventions and innovations that are anticipated to be within 3 years of potential diffusion into clinical practice . Sets of questions are applied to determine whether an y given intervention addresses an \"unmet need\" such as a large gap in effective ways to screen, diagnose, treat, monitor, manage, or provide or deliver care for a health condition or disease. Interventions might be lacking entirely, or existing options may be less than optimal. Leads that appear to address a n important unmet need are assigned to horizon scanning analysts and are assessed for grouping into potential topics. Potential topics are then described according to the PICO framework: potential patien t Population, Intervention, potential Comparators to the intervention, and potential Outcomes of interest for the patient population. During topic -nomination meeting s, additional criteria are applied to each topic, including questions about the potential importance of the unmet need, the likelihood of the intervention being adopted in the United States, the innovativeness of the intervention, and the potential impact of the intervention on current treatments, sites of care, disparities in care, health care processes and infrastructure, patient and population health outcomes, understanding of the disease or condition, clinician and patient training needs , and costs of care. Topics accepted during topic nomination meeting s are entered into the System for trac king and appear in the Status Update report as \"Currently Tracked Interventions\" and \"Interventions Added Since Last Update.\" Topics accepted for tracking may also be designated during the meeting for further searches to collect more in -depth information a bout them . Such topics must be far enough along in development (typically phase III trials for drugs, phase II or III trials for devices, and pilot information for off -label use, programs, and care -delivery innovation topics ) to have some 2 preliminary effic acy and safety data available . The horizon scanning medical librarians and analysts proceed with more in -depth and topic -specific searching for information on the se topics and topic profiles are written . Once topic profiles are developed, comments are soug ht from five to eight experts with a variety of perspectives and areas of expertise in health car e. A topic may also be archived or retired if aggregated comments from experts suggest that an intervention is unlikely to meet an unmet need or to have impact on health outcomes or health care in the U nited States . Over time, a topic may be archived because development has ceased , because it no longer addresses an unmet need, is not novel , or because the intervention has diffused past early adoption and \"timed out\" in the horizon scanning system (i.e., 2 years after approval or initial diffusion) . Populating the horizon scanning system has been ongoing since December 2010. During that time, about 19,000 leads have been uploaded into the system and reviewed by an alysts, from which about 2,090 topics have been initially identified and tracked through the system. This Status Update report contains 527 identified interventions we are currently tracking , which includes 38 new topics that were entered into the system d uring this reporting period . Since the last reporting period (November 30, 2014), w e have archived 34 topics. The reason for archiving each topic is provided in its respective priority area table of archived topics. Three reasons account for the majority o f archived topics: expert commenters saw no high -impact potential at this time for the parameters of interest to AHRQ; companies halted development for lack of funding or for trials failing to meet endpoints ; or topics that had been tracked met criteria fo r retiring from the system because they have diffused since tracking started, have shown no movement at all in more than 2 years of tracking, or are 2 years past approval by FDA . In this update, 4 priority areas comprise about 7 4.8% (394/527) of the interventions (including programs) being tracked this reporting period: the cancer priority area account s for 36.9% (194/527) of tracked topics ; functional limitations and disability priority area accounts for 19.5% (103/527), cardiovascular disease priority area accounts for 10.2% (54/527), and infectious disease priority area account s for 8.3% (44/527). Interventions being tracked in each of the remaining 10 priority conditions (arthritis, dementia, depression and other mental illness, developmental delays, diabetes, obesity, peptic ulcer disease and dyspepsia, pregnancy and childbirth, pulmonary diseases, and substance abuse) plus an additional area we designate as cross -cutting, account for 4% or fewer (each prio rity area) of the total topics tracked, for a combined total 25% (132/527) of topics being tracked in the system. In terms of overall types of interventions, about 91% (rounded to the nearest percent) fall into one of two general categories. Abou t 77% of topics are pharmaceutical/biotechnology (i.e., drug, vaccine, biologic) and about 1 4% are devices used as implants or used externally to deliver treatments. About 4% are technologies intended to screen, diagnose, identify risk, identify blood mark ers or gene mutations, or monitor a disease state (these are diagnostic devices, assays, imaging modalities). About 2% of topics are surgeries and procedures. About 1% are innovative programs, services, or care delivery practices, and another 2% involve in formation technology, information systems, or applications used in treating, managing, or monitoring patients. About 0.5% are assistive technologies (e.g., prostheses). AHRQ Healthcare Horizon Scanning System Status Report 01-31-2015 3 Section 1. Currently Tracked Interventions: 489 Interventions AHRQ Healthcare Horizon Scanning System Status Report 01-31-2015 4 Section 1. Currently Tracked Interventions Table 1. AHRQ Priority Condition: 01 Arthritis and Nontraumatic Joint Disease: 10 Interventions Topic Title Potential Patient Population Intervention Developer/Manufacturer(s) Phase of Development Potential Comparators Potential Health or Other Impact s Apremilast (Otezla) for treatment of ankylosing spondylitis Patients in whom ankylosing spondylitis has been diagnosed Investigators have not found a cure for ankylosing spondylitis. Treatments are intended to reduce inflammation and improve mobility bu t are not effective for all patients. Apremilast (Otezla\u00ae) purportedly inhibits phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE - 4). inhibiting the PDE -4 enzyme, apremilast purportedly increases intracellular cAMP, which modulates multiple inflammatory mediators. When FDA approved the product for psoriatic arthritis, it became available in 10, 20, and 30 mg strengths for oral administration. In trials for ankylosing spondylitis, it is being administered in 20 or 30 mg doses. Celgene Corp., Summit, NJ Phase III trial ongo ing; approved Mar 2014 for treating adults who have active psoriatic arthritis Corticosteroids Disease -modifying antirheumatic drugs Nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs Physical therapy Sulfasalazine (Azulfidine) Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors Reduced signs and symptoms Improved mobility Improved quality of life Brodalumab for treatment of psoriatic arthritis Patients in whom psoriatic arthritis has been diagnosed In a subset of patients with psoriatic arthritis, the disease can progress to severe and painful symptoms that, without effective treatment, can lead to deformity and disability of the hands and fingers. Available treatments, such as d isease - modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), can be suboptimal. T -helper 17 cells secrete tumor necrosis fa ctor (TNF), interleukin -17 (IL -17), and other proinflammatory cytokines that are thought to play a key role in psoriatic arthritis pathogenesis. Standard of care focuses on inhibiting TNF; however, many patients' symptoms do not respond to TNF therapy. Bro dalumab is a monoclonal antibody that purportedly blocks the IL -17 receptor, inhibiting IL-17 receptor - mediated signaling and improving psoriatic arthritis symptoms. In clinical trials, brodalumab is being given via subcutaneous injection every 2 weeks, 14 0 or 210 mg, for 16 weeks. Amgen, Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA Phase III trials ongoing Apremilast Corticosteroids dru gs TNF-alpha inhibitors Ustekinumab Improved symptom scores as measured by the American College of Rheumatology 20/50/70 (% improvement) instruments Improved scores on disability measures Improved quality of life AHRQ Healthcare Horizon Scanning System Status Report 01-31-2015 5 Section 1. Currently Tracked Interventions Topic Title Potential Patient Population Intervention Developer/Manufacturer(s) Phase of Development Potential Comparators Potential Health or Other Impact s Condoliase for treatment of lumbar disc he rniation Patients in whom lumbar disc herniation has been diagnosed About 3 million people in the U.S. are affected by lumbar disc herniation; males aged 20 -49 have a particularly high incidence. Pharmacologic treatments focus primarily on reducing pain; n o pharmacologic treatments exist for treating the disease. Disc herniation occurs when a partial protrusion of the nucleus pulposus, located in the center of each intervertebral disc, emerges from the anulus fibrosus (outer layer of the disc). Herniated di scs exert pressure on the spinal nerve root causing pain and numbness. Condoliase (SI -6603) is an enzyme therapy purported to degrade glycosaminoglycans, which are the main components of the nucleus pulposus. Some clinical researchers assume that degrading glycosaminoglycans reduces pressure on the nerves by shrinking the nucleus pulposus. Condoliase purportedly does not break down proteins, leaving surrounding tissues intact, including blood vessels and nerves. In clinical trials, condoliase is administere d at 1.25 U as a single local injection. Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan Phase III trial ongoing Lumbar disc replacement surgery Physical therapy Improved leg pain Ixekizumab for treatment of psoriatic arthritis Patients in whom active psoriatic arthritis has been diagnosed In a subset of patients with psoriatic arthritis, the disease can progress to severe and painful symptoms that, without effective treatment, can lead to deformity and disability of the hands and fingers. Available treatments, such as d isease - modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), can be suboptimal. Ixekizumab is a monoclonal antibody that purportedly blocks the activity of interleukin 17, which is thought to contribute to psoriatic arthritis pathogenesis. In the ongoing UNCOVER - 2 trial, ixekizumab is being given by subcutaneous injection in two 80 mg injections at week 0, followed by weekly 80 mg injections until week 12.

Currently Tracked Interventions Topic Title Potential Patient Population Intervention Developer/Manufacturer(s) Phase of Development Potential Comparators Potential Health or Other Impact s Joint -sparing knee implant (KineSpring System) for treatment of knee osteoarthritis Patients in whom knee osteoarthritis (OA) has been diagnosed Younger, more active patients are often poor candidates for traditional joint replacement surgery because a prosthesis may not last for the rest of their lives. The KineSpring\u00ae System purportedly fills an unmet need in knee OA treatment by providing a minimally invasive option between conservative care and joint - modifying surgery for patients with primarily unicompartmental medial knee osteoarthritis. The system is intended to treat pain and restore knee function by supplementing natural joint structures and reducing joint overload. Th e device consists of an articulated absorber (spring) anchored with bone screws to the femoral and tibial cortices using standard surgical techniques. The absorber is designed to bear up to 30 lb (13.6 kg) of body weight per step, reducing the load on the joint; 2 ball -and-socket joints at the ends of the spring are purported to match natural knee motion. The absorber is implanted in the extracapsular space along the medial side of the joint through 2 incisions. The procedure purportedly spares the joint and is reversible; the device is extracapsular and extra -articular; no bone, ligament, or cartilage is removed. Moximed, Inc., Hayward, CA Pivotal investigational device exemption trial ongoing in U.S. High tibial osteotomy Joint distraction Mesenchymal st em- cell therapy Nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs Physical therapy Platelet -rich plasma Special orthotic devices Unloading braces Weight loss (if patient is overweight) Reduced pain Improved mobility Improved quality of life Lesinurad for treatment of hyperuricemia and allopurinol - refractory gout Patients in whom hyperuricemia has been diagnosed and thus are at high risk of developing acute gout Hyperuricemia is believed to be the most important risk factor for developing gout. About half of patients w ith gout do not achieve target goals for serum uric acid levels with the standard of care, allopurinol or febuxostat. Lesinurad (RDEA594) is a selective to uric acid excretion, reducing uric acid and cryst al formation and potentially alleviating symptoms of acute gout or preventing gout flares. Lesinurad can be used as monotherapy or in combination with allopurinol or febuxostat. In clinical trials, lesinurad was administered orally, 200 mg, twice daily, or 400 mg, once daily. AstraZeneca, London, UK Phase III trials ongoing Allopurinol Colchicine Febuxostat Nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs Probenecid Steroids Reduced uric acid accumulation and crystal formation Fewer acute flares AHRQ Healthcare Horizon Scanning System Status Report 01-31-2015 7 Section 1. Currently Tracked Interventions Topic Title Potential Patient Population Intervention Developer/Manufacturer(s) Phase of Development Potential Comparators Potential Health or Other Impact s Masitinib for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis Patients in whom rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been diagnosed RA is a chronic inflammatory disease causing polyarthritis with frequent progression to permanent joint damage, deformity, and functional disability. Biologic ther apies have become standard of care for patients with RA that no longer responds to disease -modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). However, biologics must be administered by injection and are associated with increased incidence of serious infections, inclu ding tuberculosis. DMARDs with improved efficacy, tolerability, and convenient dosing are needed. Masitinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that purportedly targets the activity of mast cells, which are involved in mediating inflammation in the synovium. Ma sitinib purportedly targets mast cells through selectively inhibiting KIT, platelet -derived growth factor receptor, Lyn, and to a lesser extent, fibroblast growth factor receptor 3. In clinical trials, masitinib is administered orally, 3 or 6 mg/kg, daily. AB Science S.A., Paris, France Phase II/III trial inflammatory drugs Tofacitinib Tumor necrosis factor - alpha inhibitors Improved symptom scores as measured by American College of Rheumatology 20/50/70 (% improvement) instruments Improved quality of life Secukinumab for treatment of ankylosing spondylitis Patients in whom ankylosing spondylitis has been diagnosed Ankylosing spondylitis is an inflammatory disease, a form of arthritis that primarily affects the spine and can cause vertebrae to fuse together; investigators have not found a cure. Treatments focus on reducing inflammation, improving mobil ity, and decreasing pain, but are not effective for all patients. Effective treatments are needed. Secukinumab is purportedly a monoclonal antibody antagonist for interleukin -17 (IL -17). IL -17 purportedly is involved in developing delayed -type hypersensiti vity reactions by increasing chemokine production, which promotes the recruitment of inflammatory cells such as monocytes and neutrophils to the local area. By blocking the effects of IL -17-localized autoimmune reactions, ankylosing spondylitis pathology c ould be blocked while minimizing the systemic immunosuppression associated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers, which are often used in treatment. Administered subcutaneously, 75 or 150 mg, monthly.

Currently Tracked Interventions Topic Title Potential Patient Population Intervention Developer/Manufacturer(s) Phase of Development Potential Comparators Potential Health or Other Impact s Secukin umab for treatment of psoriatic arthritis Patients in whom psoriatic arthritis has been diagnosed In a subset of patients with psoriatic arthritis, the disease can progress to severe and painful symptoms that, without effective treatment, can lead to defor mity and disability of the hands and fingers. Some patients do not have an adequate response to disease -modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDS), and other effective treatments are needed. Secukinumab is a monoclonal antibody antagonist for interleukin -17 (IL-17) purportedly involved in developing delayed - type hypersensitivity reactions. It purportedly does so by increasing chemokine production, which promotes the recruitment of inflammatory cells such as monocytes and neutrophils to the local area. By blocki ng these effects, psoriatic arthritis pathology could be obstructed while minimizing the systemic immunosuppression associated with the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers that are often used in treatment. The drug is administered subcutaneously, 150 mg, monthly.

AHRQ Priority Condition: 02 Cancer: 184 Interventions Topic Title Potential Patient Population Intervention Developer/Manufacturer(s) Phase of Development Potential Comparators Potential H ealth or Other Impacts 5-aminolevulinic acid fluorescence guidance for identifying clear surgical margins in glioma Patients undergoing surgery for glioma Complete surgical resection of glioma improves outcomes in patients who are eligible for surgery; ho wever, the highly invasive nature of glioma and the high degree of similarity between glioma tumors and surrounding healthy brain tissue make complete surgical resection and identification of clear surgical margins difficult. 5 -aminolevulinic acid (5 -ALA) is a small -molecule prodrug that is converted to protoporphyrin IX (PIX) in neoplastic cells, but not in normal cells. Illuminating PIX with ultraviolet light induces fluorescence in the visible light spectrum, potentially serving as a marker for glioma ti ssue. Researchers postulate that surgical resection guided by the pattern of PIX fluorescence could increase the percentage of glioma tissue removed, thereby improving outcomes. 5 -ALA is administered as an oral medication about 3 -5 hours before surgery at a dose of 20 mg/kg. Medac GmbH, Hamburg, Germany (developer); NX Development Corp., Louisville, KY, has optioned development rights in North America Multiple academic research institutions including Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, Cleveland, OH; Emory University, Atlanta, GA; St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center, Phoenix, AZ; University of California, San Francisco (investigators) Phase III trial (MC -ALS.3/GLI), phase III trials (BALANCE) ongoing; commercially available as Gliolan\u00ae in Europe; FDA granted orphan drug status Standard surgical resection without fluorescence assistance Increased overall survival Increased progression -free survival Improved quality of life 90Y-clivatuzumab tetraxetan for treatment of pancreatic cancer Patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer who have received at least 2 therapies, including at least 1 gemcitabine - containing regimen Only about 5% of patients with pancreatic cancers have disease that responds to the current standard of care (gemcitabine chemotherapy), and the prognosis for these patients is poor. 90Y -clivatuzumab tetraxetan is a novel radiopharmaceutical under investigation for treating pancreatic cancer. Clivatuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds a mucin antigen expressed by most pancre atic cancer cells but is minimally expressed in pancreatitis or by normal pancreatic cells. Clivatuzumab is conjugated to the radioisotope yttrium -90 tetraxetan. In clinical trials, 90Y - clivatuzumab tetraxetan is administered once weekly for 3 weeks of each 4 -week cycle, in combination with weekly, low -dose gemcitabine (200 mg/m2, intravenously).

Currently Tracked Interventions Topic Title Potential Patient Population Intervention Developer/Manufacturer(s) Phase of Development Potential Comparators Potential H ealth or Other Impacts Abemaciclib for treatment of brea st cancer Patients with estrogen receptor - positive, HER2 - negative breast cancer in whom locally advanced disease is not amenable to treatment by surgery or who have metastatic disease Although endocrine therapies (e.g., estrogen receptor antagonists, aroma tase inhibitors) are often effective in treating patients who have estrogen receptor - positive breast cancer, the response duration is typically limited to about 1 year. Abemaciclib (LY2835219) is a dual inhibitor and controlling cell -cycle progression. CDK 4 and CDK 6 regulate a cell -cycle checkpoint controlling initiation of DNA synthesis; therefore, their inhibition may limit tumor growth mediated by cell proliferation. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that estrogen receptor -positive breast cancer may be highly sensitive to CDK 4/6 inhibition and that this inhibition may be synergistic with endocrine therapies.

A treatment option under study is chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) gene therapy to genetically modify autologous T lymphocytes to promote T -cell activation, T -cell proliferati on, and immune memory. CTL019 is produced by using a viral vector to transfect autologous T cells with a CAR transgene that encodes a protein consisting of 4 parts: (1) an extracellular domain consisting of an antibody variable chain specific for CD19 (a c ell surface marker expressed by ALLs); (2) a hinge region; (3) a costimulatory domain (in this case, a portion of CD137); and (4) CD3 - zeta (a signal transduction component of the T -cell receptor). Binding of the extracellular domain of this recombinant pro tein to CD19 on target cells activates the pathways, typically downstream of major histocompatibility complex activation and CD137 stimulation, purportedly activating a persistent immune response against CD19. CTL019 T cells are administered by intravenous infusion.

Etirinotecan pegol (NKTR -102) is a I inhibitor irinotecan. Etirinotecan pegol is a modified version of irinotecan in which the drug is linked to a macromolecule core. The linkage purportedly renders the drug inert in the bloodstream and allows the slow release of the drug as the linkages are metabolized in the patient. Slow release extends the time during which the patient's disease is exposed to therapeutic leve ls of the drug, thus limiting exposure to high levels of the drug at the time of infusion. Additionally, the large drug-polymer conjugate may preferentially accumulate in tumor tissues because of the increased permeability of tumor vasculature.

A gene -mediat ed cytotoxic immunotherapy (GMCI), ProstAtak, is being tested for preventing recurrence after conventional therapy. GMCI purportedly leads to direct tumor cytotoxicity as well as a protective immune response. The treatment consists of an adenovirus vector that contains a herpes simplex virus (HSV) thymidine kinase gene (Adv -tk). After the virus is injected into the tumor site, the patient receives the anti -HSV drug valacyclovir, which is activated by the tk transgene and produces an active drug that kills rapidly dividing cells. This, in turn, leads to local cytotoxicity through local release of activated valacyclovir and the release of tumor antigens that may be taken up by dendritic cells and produce a systemic immune response. In treating prostate cancer , GMCI is being administered in combination with radiation therapy (RT). Patients receive 3 GMCI injections at 2 -8 weeks before 1st RT, at the time of 1st RT, and 2 -3 weeks after 1st RT.

EGEN -001 is a novel gene therapy intended to induce the expression of interleukin -12 (IL -12) in tumor cells; IL -12 expression purportedly leads to 3 antitumor activities: (1) activation and proliferation of natural killer (NK) cells, leading to an in nate immune response against the tumor; (2) maturation and proliferation of T lymphocytes, leading to an adaptive immune response against the tumor; and (3) activation of NK cells and T lymphocytes leading to upregulation of interferon gamma, which has ant iangiogenic properties. EGEN - 001 is formulated with the TheraPlas delivery system that forms active nanoparticles that transfect cells with a plasmid expressing IL-12; this formulation is optimized for delivery into the tumor microenvironment. This agent is being tested in platinum -refractory ovarian cancer. In clinical trials, EGEN -001 is administered by intraperitoneal catheter, 24 mg/m2, weekly.

About 20% of AML cases harbor a mutation in the IDH2 gene, which encodes an enzyme that regulates fu ndamental aspects of cell metabolism. Mutant forms of IDH2 observed in AMLs lead to both a decrease in the levels of alpha -ketoglutarate (the normal IDH2 metabolite) and an increase in the levels of another metabolite, D -2-hydroxyglutarate. These shifts pu rportedly have several potentially tumorigenic effects, including stimulating angiogenesis and affecting histone modification and DNA methylation. IDH2 loss of function has also been hypothesized to promote tumorigenesis through alteration of cell metaboli sm and increased susceptibility to oxidative stress. AG -221 is a small -molecule inhibitor of IDH2 . In clinical trials, it is administered orally at an undisclosed dose.

Patients who have been treated with 1st -line platinum -based chemotherapy often have recurrent disease and a poor prognosis. Motolimod (VTX -2337) is a toll -like receptor 8 (TLR8) agonist. This agonist is a signaling component of the innate immune system and upon induction can activate various cell types of the innate immune response (dendritic cell s, macrophages, and natural killer cells). Additionally, these activated cells produce cytokines that recruit cells of the adaptive immune response. TLR agonists purportedly promote a synergistic immune response against cancer cells, possibly through activ ation of T cells and/or differentiation of B cells into antibody -secreting plasma cells. Immune -response activation by motolimod might overcome immune tolerance to tumor -associated antigens, potentially leading to an anticancer immune response. In clinical trials, it is being tested in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin as 2nd -line treatment for recurrent ovarian cancer.

However, ipilimumab has a relatively low response rate, and the prognosis for patients with advanced melanoma remains poor. Nivolumab (BMS -936558) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that targe ts an immune -checkpoint pathway distinct from that of ipilimumab. Nivolumab purportedly blocks the programmed death -1 (PD -1) co - inhibitory receptor expressed by activated T cells. The activity of this pathway has been shown to limit T cell activation; ther efore, blocking its activity may enhance the body's immune response, potentially overcoming immune tolerance to melanoma. This agent is being tested in patients with unresectable, advanced melanomas and in patients whose disease has progressed after anti -CTLA-4 therapy. In clinical trials, nivolumab is administered intravenously at a dose of 3 mg/kg, once every 2 weeks.

RX - 3117 is an inactive nucleoside analog that can inhibit DNA and RNA synthesis when it is phosphorylated by the enzyme uridine cytidine kinase (UCK), wh ich leads to apoptotic cell death of tumor cells. Although UCK is overexpressed in multiple human tumors (e.g., pancreatic, nonsmall cell lung, breast, ovarian cancers), it has a scant presence in normal tissues, so targeting it could improve safety and ef ficacy in patients who have cancer. In clinical trials, patients will undergo 8 cycles of an undetermined dose of RX -3117 taken orally, 3 times a week, for 3 weeks followed by a week of rest.

Patients with acute GVHD typically exhibit damage to the ski n, liver, and gastrointestinal tract, and GVHD is lethal in up to 80% of patients with severe forms of the disease. Current prophylactic treatments for GVHD target donor immune cells in a way that may delay immune system reconstitution and/or limit graft -versus -tumor immune responses. A potential molecular target in GVHD is chemokine (C -C motif) receptor 5 (CCR5), which has been shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of GVHD by promoting lymphocyte recruitment to the involved tissues. Maraviroc (Selzentry\u00ae) is a CCR5 antagonist that may limit lymphocyte recruitment to target tissues, potentially limiting the extent of recipient tissue damage. In clinical trials, maraviroc is administered at an oral dose of 300 mg, daily, in combination with standard GVHD p rophylaxis.

Retrospective studies of patients with diabetes taking metformin, preclinical studies of in vitro cell lines, and in vivo cancer models have demonstrated that metformin may have antineoplastic properties. Metformin may exert its effects by activating AMP -activated protein kinase, which functions to limit downstream components of the mTOR pathway. Additionally, metformin's actions in reducing circulating insulin l evels may be antineoplastic because of the potential growth - stimulating activity of insulin. Metformin is being studied in multiple breast cancer settings and could represent a novel treatment with a relatively low side -effect profile.

Additionally, for patients with de nse breast tissue, mammographic screening may fail to detect some cancers. To address these issues, the Imagio breast imaging system combines traditional ultrasound with opto-acoustic imaging to create a map of the vasculature in and around suspicious masses. This approach is centered on 2 hallmarks of cancerous lesions: enhanced angiogenesis and deoxygenation. Opto -acoustic imaging directs a short laser pulse into the target tissue, generating local tissue heating and expansion that causes ultrasonic pres sure-waves to move through the tissue. These waves are detected by high -frequency pressure sensors to generate an opto -acoustic blood map that is projected on traditional ultrasound. In clinical trials, Imagio is used in diagnostic imaging procedures in pa tients with suspected breast lesions.

Females (children or adults) who have undergone systemic chemotherapy or whole-body radiation therapy especially may wish to preserve their ability to have children. A new option involves ovarian tissue cryopreservation. Before the patient undergoes treatment, clinicians collect ovarian tissue in a laparoscopic procedure requiri ng general anesthesia. Collected tissue is prepared to withstand the freezing process, and is then cryopreserved until completion of cancer treatment. Upon remission, the tissue is transplanted back into the patient to restore normal hormonal cycling and, if successful, fertility.

Palbociclib (Ibrance) is a dual inhibitor of cyclin 4 and CDK 6, are kinases involved in controlling cell -cycle progression. CDK 4 and CDK 6 regulate a cell -cycle checkp oint controlling initiation of DNA synthesis; therefore, their inhibition may limit tumor growth mediated by cell proliferation. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that estrogen receptor -positive breast cancer may be highly sensitive to CDK 4/6 inhibiti on and that this inhibition may be synergistic with endocrine therapies. The drug is being studied for use in combination with letrozole as 1st -line treatment for advanced disease, in combination with fulvestrant for treating endocrine therapy -refractory a dvanced disease, and in combination with exemestane for treating aromatase inhibitor -resistant advanced disease.

First, NSCLC frequently develops resistance to EGFR inhibitors. This resistance is often mediated by a mutation in EGFR (T790M), which renders the kinase insensitive to current inhibitors. Second, available EGFR inhibitors have activity against wild -type EGFR in addition to mutant forms, and the inhibition in noncancer cells can lead to substantial toxicity. Rociletin ib (CO - 1686) is a novel, irreversible EGFR inhibitor that is specific for mutant forms of EGFR , including EGFR harboring the T790M resistance mutation. Therefore, it has potential efficacy in patients whose disease has progressed during treatment with exis ting EGFR inhibitors and might improve on the tolerability of EGFR - inhibitor therapy. In clinical trials, rociletinib is being administered orally, at doses between 500 and 1,000 mg, twice daily.

PV -10 is a solution of the fluorescein derivative rose ben gal. Rose bengal preferentially accumulates in cancer cells because of the increased lipid content of their cell membranes, which allows the drug to cross. Within the cells, rose bengal accumulates in lysosomes, triggering lysosomal release and cellular toxicity. Besides causing local tumor cell lysis, rose bengal has been associated with a bystander effect in which untreated lesions exhibit a response to treatment. This effect is thought to be due to uptake of tumor antigens by cells of the immune system a fter tumor lysis, leading to a systemic immune response. It is administered by intralesional injection.

Therefore, disease remission in this patient populat ion is relatively low. Tumor suppressors normally function in cells to inhibit the aberrant cellular activities associated with cancer development. Many tumor suppressors (e.g., p53, pRB, TOXO, APC, NPM1) require nuclear localization to function, and many tumor types have been shown to drive cytoplasmic localization of these tumor suppressors through overexpression of the nuclear export factor CRM1. Selinexor (KPT -330) is an antagonist of CRM1 activity that purportedly restores nuclear localization of tumor suppressors to potentially inhibit growth and survival of cancers.

The traditional approach to reducing GVHD has b een the use of T cell - depleted grafts comprised of only hematopoietic stem cells; however, this approach is hampered by reduced levels of hematopoietic cell engraftment and reduced graft -versus -leukemia immune response. Infusion of suicide gene - engineered donor lymphocytes following hematopoietic SCT is an approach being taken to overcome these shortcomings. In this approach, donor T cells are genetically modified to express herpes simplex virus ganciclovir agent, thereby conferring selective toxicity on thymidine kinase -expressing cells and providing a means to promote the \"suicide\" of GVHD -causing T cells. The infusion of T cells after hematopoietic SCT is purported to promote engra ftment and graft -versus - leukemia immune activity.

About 50% of people with HF die within 5 years of diagnosis. Projections suggest that HF prevalence will increase 25% from 2013 to 2030 and that costs will increase 120%. HF treatments depend on the stage of disease, and angiotensin -convert ing enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are used to treat stage A (i.e., early stage) disease, but are sometimes ineffective or suboptimally effective. LCZ696 is a 1st -in-class angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) that purportedly acts in several ways on the neurohormonal systems of the heart. It reportedly blocks receptors that exert harmful effects while at the same time promoting protective mechanisms. In this way, LCZ696 is believed to reduce strain on a failin g heart so the heart muscle can recover. In clinical trials, it is being administered at twice -daily doses of 50, 100, or 200 mg.

Long -term anticoagulant therapy is the most effective stroke -prevention strategy in patients with AF; however, contraindications, bleeding complications, and patient adherence to therapy make this strategy difficult. Bucindolol hydrochloride (Gencaro) is a pharmacologically unique beta blocker and mild vasodilator being investigated for treating AF. According to the manufacturer, bucindolol hydrochloride is considered part of the beta blocker class because it blocks beta -1 and beta -2 receptors in the heart. This action purportedly prevents these receptors from binding with other, receptor -activati ng molecules. In a planned clinical trial, the manufacturer intends to enroll patients who respond favorably to bucindolol hydrochloride because they have a genetic variant of the beta -1 cardiac receptor.

Yet, many cases of hypertension are not controlled with these interventions, and because such treatment -resistant hypertension is assoc iated with high morbidity (e.g., end -organ damage) and mortality, novel interventions are warranted. Hyperactivity of the afferent and efferent sympathetic nerves from and to the kidneys are thought to play a role in blood pressure regulation and the patho physiology of hypertension, and deactivating these nerves might reduce this hyperactivity, potentially lowering blood pressure. The Symplicity\u00ae catheter system is intended to accomplish renal denervation through a minimally invasive procedure. The device affects the output of the sympathetic nerves outside the renal artery walls. The system consists of a proprietary generator and flexible catheter that is inserted through the femoral artery and threaded into the renal artery near each kidney. Once in place, the catheter tip delivers low -power radiofrequency energy to deactivate surrounding sympathetic nerves. Renal denervation does not involve a permanent implant. Medtronic, Inc., Minneapolis, MN Phase III trial (SYMPLICITY HTN -3) ongoing; completed enroll ment May 2013; FDA and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) accepted Symplicity renal denervation system for consideration in their parallel review program, which allows CMS to begin its national coverage determination process while FDA compl etes its review of safety and efficacy; Dec 2013, the company announced enrollment of a phase III trial , SYMPLICITY HTN -4; Jan 2014, the company announced that the SYMPLICITY HTN -3 trial did not meet primary efficacy endpoint, but did meet primary safety e ndpoint; enrollment suspended in SYMPLICITY HTN -4 trial; Mar 2014, the company announced that it will continue to develop the Symplicity device ; 9 trials ongoing in Europe Pharmacotherapy (e.g., angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, beta blockers) Renal artery stents Controlled hypertension with fewer or no medications Reduced rates of blindness, heart attacks, kidney failure, and stroke AHRQ Healthcare Horizon Scanning System Status Report 01-31-2015 108 Section 1.

Left ventricular remodeling (enlargement) occu rs in many patients who experience a myocardial infarction, resulting in decreased cardiac output, fatigue, and shortness of breath. The unaffected portion of the heart compensates for this output loss and becomes overloaded. The Parachute Ventricular Par titioning Device purportedly has the potential to be the 1st minimally invasive, catheter -based treatment for ischemic HF. According to its manufacturer, the Parachute implant is deployed in the left ventricle to partition the damaged portion of the heart from the functional heart segment, potentially decreasing the left ventricle's volume and restoring its geometry and function. According to the company, the procedure is performed with the patient under conscious sedation in a catheterization lab and takes about 75 minutes.

Causes of severe aortic stenosis include buildup of calcium deposits on the aortic valve, prior radiation therapy, certain medications, and a history of rheumatic fever. An estimated 30% of patients with symptomatic, severe aortic stenosis are not suitable candidates for open -heart valve implantation but may be candidates for a less invasive option, transcatheter aortic valve implantation. However, this procedure is associated with a risk of embolic debris being released during the procedure and causing a stroke or death. The TriGuard cerebral protection device is intended to deflect embolic debris during endovascular procedures. It consists of a self -positioning nitinol frame and mesh pur ported to provide full coverage to all brain areas.

Currently Tracked Interventions Topic Title Potential Patient Population Intervention Developer/Manufacturer(s) Phase of Development Potential Comparators Potential Health or Other Impacts Electrical stimulation of carotid baroreceptors (Barostim neo Legacy system) for treatment -resista nt hypertension Patients in whom severe, drug - resistant hypertension has been diagnosed Available pharmacotherapies for treating hypertension do not achieve desired blood pressure control in many cases. Uncontrolled and treatment -resistant hypertension is associated with high morbidity and mortality; novel interventions are needed. Baroreceptors in the aortic arch and the carotid sinuses are fibers that act as natural blood pressure sensors and control nervous system activity that affects the heart, kidneys , and peripheral blood vessels. When baroreceptors are stimulated by an increase in blood pressure, sympathetic efferent nerves are inhibited. Signaling by sympathetic efferent nerves typically increases blood pressure through its effects on cardiac, renal , and vasomotor targets. Therefore, blocking sympathetic nervous system activity in response to elevated blood pressure, combined with a simultaneous increase in parasympathetic activity, can act as a negative -feedback loop to stabilize blood pressure by r educing heart rate and fluid volume and dilating arteries. The Barostim neo Legacy system uses a pacemaker -like implantable pulse generator, inserted subcutaneously near the clavicle, to continuously deliver electrical signals to baroreceptors in both the left and right carotid arteries in the neck, via 2 carotid sinus leads. Device voltage can be titrated by physicians, via an external programmer, until the patient reaches a predetermined hemodynamic endpoint or the maximum dose is reached. The Neo System has 1 carotid sinus lead, and implantation requires only a unilateral incision.

Treatments for HF depend on the sta ge of disease. Available implanted devices for HF (e.g., left ventricular -assist devices) contact the patient's blood, elevating the risk of blood clots and stroke.

The device is intended to reduce the workload of the left ventricle. The system's driver operates outside the body and is connected to the C - Pulse device. According to the manufacturer, when the balloon inflates, blood flow to the coronary arteries increases, potentially providing additional oxygen t o the heart. The company claims that during deflation, the workload required by the left ventricle is reduced.

Currently, donor hearts being transported for transplantation are stopped and transported on ice, in a cooler (i.e., cold ischemic storage). This method has limits, such as a narrow treatment window, the potential for damage, and th e inability to test the heart for function. The Organ Care System (OCS Heart) is intended to keep the heart in a \"living\" state as it is transported. Through an internal gas supply, internal monitor, and pulsatile pumping system, OCS Heart purportedly prov ides blood oxygenation and flow, warms the heart as necessary, maintains humidity, and protects the heart from contamination from the time of removal from the donor to implantation in the recipient. The manufacturer states that with this method, the heart may withstand longer periods of time outside of the body and be less vulnerable to damage during transportation, and it can be tested for function and tissue matching.

Available embolic protection devices include baskets and filters, which have purportedly limited efficacy and significant risks to patients. The Silk Road System device is intended to provide safer and more effective cerebral embolic protection during CAS. The system enables the interventional cardiologist to deliver a stent directly from the neck rather than from the femoral artery to avoid complications associated with catheterization that starts from the femoral artery in the groin, as is typica l. Starting from the groin can purportedly increase the risk of releasing plaque debris, which can travel to the brain and cause stroke. To protect the patient's brain during the procedure, the Silk Road system purportedly temporarily reverses blood flow t o move any debris away from the brain. It does not use a catchment device as other embolic protection technologies do. The clinician can purportedly regulate the speed of carotid blood flow and even stop it momentarily if needed.

The VenTouch Targeted Ventricular Reshaping S ystem is a minimally invasive device intended to repair the root cause of MR. It consists of an impermeable bladder that is positioned over a targeted area of the posterior and septal lateral left ventricle. The bladder is then injected with a saline solution until the desired level of regurgitation is achieved. The system applies a light amount of pressure that forces valve leaflets closer together, thus reducing regurgitation. The device is implanted without open surgery or cardiopulmonary bypass.

However, technical cha llenges are associated with administ ering transcranial ultrasound, and sonographers capable of detecting occluded cerebral artery segments are available only in specialized stroke centers or emergency departments. ClotBust-ER is a hands -free ultrasound de vice that employs multiple transducers operating at 2 MHz. It is intended to deliver therapeutic ultrasound energy to the vessel occlusion in the brain to treat ischemic stroke in patients eligible for intravenous thrombolytic therapy. The system includes multiple ultrasound transducers mounted on an adjustable head frame worn by the sonographer to administer therapeutic ultrasound in the principal regions in which the majority of vessel occlusions in the brain occur. Because the transducers self -align base d on anthropometric landmarks, they do not need to be aimed by a trained sonographer.

Treatment -resistant hypertension is associated with high morbidity (e.g., end -organ damage) and mortality, and novel interventions are needed for this population. Focused ultrasound therapy might offer an option for this patient population. Hyperactivity of the afferent and efferent sympathetic nerves from and to the kidneys are thought to play a role in blood pressure regulation and the pathophysiology of hypertension, and deactivating these nerves might reduce this hyperactivity, potentially lowering blood pressure. The Kona Surround Sound\u00ae system uses a mobile platform consisting of ultrasound image -guided focused ultrasound energy. The ultrasound imaging component tracks the position of renal nerves and delivers focused ultrasound energy externally to ablate them without damaging the renal artery. It is distinguished from magnetic resonance -guided focused ultrasound in that it uses an ultrasound platf orm for both the imaging and the ablation. According to the manufacturer, the noninvasive, mobile delivery platform system provides an alternative to minimally invasive, catheter -based renal denervation; it can be performed in any hospital exam room and do es not require the use of a catheterization laboratory.

About 50% of people with HF die within 5 years of diagnosis. Projections suggest that the pr evalence of HF will increase 25% from 2013 to 2030 and that costs will increase 120%. Treatments for HF depend on the stage of disease. CardioFit\u00ae vagus nerve stimulation is an implantable device intended to improve heart -pumping capacity in patients with severe congestive HF. The system is intended to stimulate the vagus nerve, which purportedly controls parasympathetic innervation of the heart. The company purports that stimulation will stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system, potentially lowering th e heart rate, lessening the heart's workload, and alleviating heart failure symptoms. The system consists of a stimulator that is implanted subcutaneously in the right subclavicular region (similar to a pacemaker); a sensing lead, which is passed through a vein into the right ventricle where it monitors heart activity and can halt stimulation as needed; and a stimulation lead, placed around the right vagus nerve about 2 -3 cm below the carotid artery bifurcation. The stimulator is wirelessly programmed by th e clinician. The manufacturer states that the procedure can be conducted using either local or general anesthesia.

Patients with acute limb ischemia experience poor outcomes, with many requiring amputation. Treatment strategies target thrombolysis of the obstruction with pharmacological agents or surgery. Vepol oxamer (MST -188) is a pharmaceutical agent being investigated as adjunct therapy for patients with acute limb ischemia currently treated with tissue plasminogen (tPA). It purportedly improves the clot -busting action of tPA and minimizes perfusion injury. A ccording to the manufacturer, vepoloxamer inhibits multiple inflammatory processes and binds to damaged cellular membranes, thus increasing blood flow to the extremities.

CTE is a progressive neurodegenerative disease seen most often in athletes with a history of repetitive brain trauma. It can lead to dementia, memory loss, anger, confusion, and depression. The disease is diagnosed only after evaluating brain tissue posthumously for evidence of degenerated tissue and elevated tau protein. To find ways to diagnose the disease in living patients, researchers have studied positron emission tomography (PET) FDDNP is a radiotracer that binds to tau protein and amyloid deposits and may prove useful in locating these tau protein deposits in the amygdala and subcortical re gions of the brain. In an unphased trial of PET imaging with FDDNP , results showed that compared with tau protein deposits in control patients, increased tau protein deposits were present in these regions in the 5 retired National Football League players w ho participated.

MK -8931 is a beta -amyloid precursor protein site - cleaving enzyme (BACE) inhibitor being investigated for treating AD and prodromal AD. BACE is an enzyme known to play a role in initiating synthesis of amyloid beta peptide. Because abnormal amyloid beta peptide accumulation is hypothesized to be a biomarker of AD and AD progression, researchers purport that BACE inhibitors may potentially halt or delay AD.

Besides the neurocognitive declines associated with the diseas e, patients with AD also have physical or verbal outbursts not associated with confusion or patient needs; as a group, these behaviors are classified as agitation. Drugs commonly used to treat agitation are not consistently effective and have multiple side effects. Additional, effective pharmaceutical interventions are needed. Neurobiologic data suggest that agitation may be the result of reduced serotonin levels and increased levels of noradrenaline and dopamine. Brexpiprazole (OPC -34712) is a dopamine D 2 receptor partial agonist purported to reduce agitation in patients with AD.

The ability to advance diagnostic timelines might enable better treatment outcomes for patients at risk of AD. This diagnostic method combines neuropsychologic assessment of cognitive function (and impairment) with analysis of brain structural data acquire d using magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI). The combination of diagnostic tools purportedly increases the classification, sensitivity, and specificity of identifying patients who will progress to dementia indicative of probable AD. Results of reported studie s identify specific cognitive predictors (deficits in free recall and recognition episodic -memory tasks) and brain structural changes (thinning of right anterior cingulate gyrus) as highly suggestive of progression to dementia.

AD is also marked by a decline in the amount of cholinergic neurons and the associated acetylcholine (ACh) neurotransmitter in the brain. EVP -6124 is an alpha -7 nicotinic ACh receptor agonist that purportedly has a novel mechanism for treating cognitive impairment in AD, acting as a co -agonis t with ACh to enhance cognition. By acting as a co -agonist and sensitizing the alpha -7 receptor, EVP -6124 purportedly allows smaller amounts of ACh to activate the receptor.

The ability to advance diagnostic timelines with an early screening test might enable better outcomes for patients at risk of AD. Research has shown that beta-amyloid plaques, commonly hypothesized to indicate AD in living and postmortem patient analyses, are localized in brain regions and in the retina. The NeuroVision Imaging System (NVI) is a n oninvasive digital retinal fluore scence imaging technology that reportedly can accurately identify these plaques in retinal tissue of patients 15 -20 years earlier than standard clinical diagnostics. It is intended for use in screening as an adjunct to brain imaging. The digital fluorescen ce imaging technology uses curcumin, a component of tumeric, as a plaque labeling agent . Patients receive a curcumin supplement during an office visit and return another day for imaging. The curcumin shows as a fluorescent yellow color to display the amylo id-beta plaques in people's retinas. If that test results correlates with brain images, researchers believe it can be used for screening for AD.

Available treatments for diabetic peripheral neuropathy involve control of secondary symptoms (i.e., pain management). In the body, c -peptide is generated during insulin processing and is secreted along with insulin. Until recently, c -peptide was not thought to possess biological activity and was used as a biomarker; however, recent studies suggest that a lack of c - peptide (which is not provided by exogenous insulin administration) may contribute to various secondary complications of diabetes. Ersatta is an extended -release formulation of c -peptide under study for treating various secondary complications of diabetes, including neuropathy. In trials, it is given as an injection at high dose (2.4 mg) or low dose (0.8 mg), once weekly, for up to 5 2 weeks.

Because available CGM devices are reportedly not as accurate as standard bloo d glucose meters, patients must confirm glucose levels with a meter before changing their treatment on the basis of a CGM measurement alone. Also, traditional CGM sensors need to be replaced after several days or a week. The GlySens implantable CGM is inte nded as a long -term CGM purported to work continuously for up to 1 year or longer. The system consists of 2 components: a fully implantable sensor and an external receiver with monitor that displays \"continuous, at -a-glance\" glucose status and provides ale rts if hypo - or hyperglycemic excursions occur. The sensor is implanted subcutaneously in the abdomen during a brief outpatient procedure and purportedly requires minimal calibration.

Ataluren (Trans larna) is a small -molecule compound purported to treat dystrophinopathies, including DMD caused by nonsense mutations; the manufacturer hypothesizes that ataluren interacts directly with ribosomes, decreasing sensitivity to premature stop codons. This dec reased sensitivity purportedly enables ribosomes to read through nonsense mRNA stop codons and produce functional dystrophin protein. In clinical trials, adolescent male patients are administered 40 mg/kg ataluren in 3 daily doses (10 mg/kg in the morning, 10 mg/kg at midday, and 20 mg/kg in the evening) for about 96 weeks.

An unmet need exists for safe, effective treat ments for patients with treatment -refractory forms of inflammatory MS. Peripheral blood stem cell therapy purportedly addresses this need by preventing motor disability symptoms associated with MS. In this treatment, autologous unmanipulated blood stem cel ls are obtained, conditioned with a regimen of cyclophosphamide and rabbit antithymocyte globulin (rATG), then infused back into the patient; research has suggested that this technique yields more hematopoietic stem cells than other methods, increasing tre atment efficiency.

The disorder typically causes low muscle mass and function, short stature, incomplete sexual development, a chronic feeling of hunger, and metabolism that uses drastically fewer calories than n ormal. This leads to excessive eating and life-threatening obesity. PWS occurs in males and females equally and in all races. Worldwide prevalence estimates range from 1 in 8,000 to 1 in 50,000. Obesity is identified as the main cause of morbidity and mort ality in PWS. Thus, weight reduction is important for prolonged survival. Beloranib is under development for this patient population; it inhibits methionine aminopeptidase 2 (MetAp2), which reportedly reduces hunger and blood flow to fatty tissues, starvin g them, and increasing metabolism of fat as an energy source. Researchers purport that this can induce weight loss. This drug is injected and administered subcutaneously at 0.9 mg/m2, 3 or 6 mg, twice daily for about 1 month.

Progressive keratoconus requires invasive interventions, such as corneal transplants and insertion of corneal rings, and it is the leading cause in corneal transplants in the U.S. These invasi ve surgical interventions may present unfavorable complications, such as graft rejection, persistent visual problems, permanent vision loss, and prolonged surgical recovery. If accepted, corneal collagen -crosslinking (CCL) would provide a procedure that is less invasive, requires a shorter recovery time, and generates more optimal clinical outcomes to improve patient quality of life. CCL is performed by removing the corneal epithelium and applying riboflavin drops to the eye; the eye is then exposed to ultr aviolet light, which interacts with the riboflavin. The interaction produces reactive oxygen molecules that cause chemical bonds to form between and within the corneal collagen fibrils, making them stiffer.

Within the U.S., the prevalence of AA amyloidosis is unknown, but it has been determined that the disorder is more common in females than males. Because SAA levels are often elevated during inflammation, AA amyloidosis can manifest in patients with a variety of inflammatory conditions, including Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and tuberculosis. No curative treatment for AA amyloidosis is available. Eprodisate disodium (Kiacta) is designed to interfere with the formation of AA fibrils that can accumulate in organs and t issues; specifically, it is purported that eprodisate disodium indirectly protects renal function in patients with AA amyloidosis. In clinical trials, eprodisate disodium is administered orally, at dosages of 400, 800, or 1,200 mg, twice daily. Bellus Hea lth, Inc.

Pharmacological therapies have helped treat epilepsy, but it commonly recurs. Surgical procedures such as craniotomy may be performed, but they may leave the brain susceptible to unintended injury and resultant neurological complications. External trigeminal nerve stimulation (eTNS) using the Monarch device is a noninvasive therapy in which mild electrical signals pass through electrodes placed on the patient's forehead. eTNS is in tended to transcutaneously stimulate the various branches of the trigeminal nerve (the largest cranial nerve), which projects to the amygdala. The stimulation is controlled by an external pulse generator worn by patients during sleep.

In the U.S., about 40,000 people have CIDP. It is caused by damage to the myelin sheath of peripheral nerves. CIDP is most common in young adult men, with symptoms including tingling or numbness in appendages, weakness of the arms and legs, areflexia, and fatigue. Treatments for CIDP, including immunoglobul in medications, attempt to alleviate symptoms or prevent further loss of peripheral nerve myelin. However, about 20% of CIDP cases do not respond to available treatments. Fingolimod (Gilenya\u00ae), an immunomodulating drug, is purportedly an effective treatmen t for CIDP, possibly acting by decreasing demyelination of sciatic nerves. In planned trials, patients with CIDP will receive daily oral administrations of 0.5 mg.

Increased disease prevalence is seen in people of African and Mediterranean descent; about 1 in 500 African -American children born have sickle cell anemia. In SC D, sickled red blood cells are more susceptible to oxidative damage and inappropriate adhesion, which can lead to vaso -occlusion crisis (VOC). VOC causes severe pain by obstructing vasculature; it requires hospitalization. Patients may progress to thromboe mbolic events, stroke, organ failure, or early death. The only FDA - approved treatment for SCD, hydroxyurea, can reduce VOC incidence but is not effective in about 1/3 of adult patients with SCD.

It consists of a lentil -sized, magne tic, tracer -stud that is affixed to the tongue, most commonly by piercing. In spinal cord injuries, the tongue is generally spared from injury because it is innervated by nerves from the brain and not the spinal cord. The tongue is also strong and does not fatigue easily. The magnetic tracer -stud creates a magnetic field around the pierced glossal area detected by a wireless headset. The headset transmits information to a smartphone carried by the patient. The smartphone can then transmit information to a w heelchair or computer, commanding these devices to perform tasks such as wheelchair movement or daily computer tasks (e.g., email). This system can be recharged via a USB after 2 days of continuous use. A standby mechanism allows patients to perform daily tasks, such as eating, sleeping, and conversing, without unnecessary TDS use. Patients must undergo training with the TDS for the computer program to appropriately interpret and calibrate tongue movement, allowing proper control of the patient wheelchair a nd computer device.

Early detection of these conditions can be difficult because standard screening methods lack sufficient sensitivity a nd specificity, thereby missing cases of children who should be referred for further evaluation and possible treatment. If found early, amblyopia and strabismus are fully treatable, but as many as half of affected children are not identified until school a ge. The Pediatric Vision Scanner (PVS) purportedly improves screening for these conditions because it can be used in younger children, is easy to use, and is portable. It is intended as a screening tool for use in a pediatrician's office to identify childr en who should be referred to a specialist for further evaluation.

As a genetic, inherited disorder, HD arises from genetically programmed degeneration of neuro ns in the brain. The degeneration results in uncontrolled movements, loss of cognitive abilities, and emotional disturbance. Affected cells include the basal ganglia, which coordinate movement. Also affected is the brain's cortex, which controls thought, p erception, and memory. No cure exists for HD, and current therapies help only to manage emotional and motor symptoms associated with the disease.

Patients may experience multiple seizure types, including tonic, atonic, myoclonic, and atypical absence. Patients with Dravet syndrome, also known as severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (SMEI), experience frequent fever -related (febrile) seizures in the 1st year of life, followed by myoclonic seizures later in childhood. Both epilepsy forms result in developmental delays, socio -emotional difficulties, and cognitive impairments that may necessitate permanent caregiver interventions. Investigators have not found cures for LGS or Dravet syndrome, although anticonvulsant drugs and ketogenic diets may provide some temporary relief from seizures. Patients who are treated with anticonvulsants may develop tolerances to medications, limiting treatment options. Up to 70% of LGS cases are caused by brain malformat ions, perinatal asphyxia, central nervous system infection, or inherited degenerative conditions; genetic defects cause a similar percentage of Dravet syndrome cases.

These techniques , however, depend on transient visualization of lesions and do not provide information that correlates well to patients' clinical symptoms or predicts disease progression. This limitation prevents clinicians from rapidly addressing asymptomatic advances in disease state and from initiating early treatment. Quantitative susceptibility - based (QS) MRI is a technique that purportedly more accurately identifies areas of damaged white and gray matter, providing better MS progression tracking and advancing clinica l early diagnostic capabilities. Additionally, QS MRI can be paired with standard MR imaging for supplemental patient analyses.

Pharmacological therapies have helped treat epilepsy, but it commonly recurs. Surgical procedures such as craniotomy may be performed, but they may leave the brain susceptible to unintended injury and resultant neurological com plications. Laser ablation therapy would provide a minimally invasive, potentially curative therapy for patients who have epilepsy. Laser ablation surgery involves using MRI - guided laser technology to ablate lesions in specific and nearly inaccessible regions of the brain. The laser probe is inserted through a hole (diameter of a pen) created in the skull to map the brain and then ablate the confirmed affected area. To protect surrounding neurological tissue, an automatic system shuts the laser down when ap proaching such areas.

It is marked by pronounced retinal dystrophy leading to severe visual impairment. LCA is the most common cause of inherited blindness in childhood and is the primary cause of blindness in more than 20% of children who attend schools for the blind. Symptoms include photophobia, nystagmus, and extreme farsightedness (hyperopia). Patients' pupils are unresponsive to light, and retinal tissues have little to no function, evidenced by electroretinogram readings. Untreated, all patients with LCA progress to total blindness from loss of retinal photoreceptor cells. To date, mutations in at least 17 different genes are known to cause LCA, including RPE65 , a gene on locus LCA2 that may cause 16% of LCA cases. No cure is available, and supporti ve treatment focuses on lifestyle management to address the impact of vision limitations. Adeno -associated viral vector gene therapy is a treatment that purportedly can cure LCA or significantly improve visual impairment caused by LCA, through delivery of nonmutated RPE65 gene copies to patients' retinas. The functional gene is delivered to surviving photoreceptor cells. In clinical trials, patients with LCA receive a single subretinal, surgical administration of gene therapy vector AAV2 -hRPE65v2, at a dosa ge of 1.5x10^11 vector genomes per eye; eyes are dosed on separate days.

C1INH inhibits the C1 protease that is responsible for activating the complement pathway in the immune system. If C1INH is deficient, the immune system reacts with an inflammatory response that leads to swelling. Ruconest\u00ae is purportedly the 1st recombinant replacement therapy for C1INH deficiency. It consists of human recombinant C1 -esterase inhibitor purified from the milk of transgenic rabbits, and it is intended to treat acute attacks of swelling by restoring functional plasma levels.

The deficiency occurs less often in infants than in children, adolescents, or adults, but the early onset form, also known as Wolman disease, is rapidly fatal, usually within t he 1st year. Late-onset LAL is also known as cholesteryl ester storage disease and can lead to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, liver failure, cardiovascular events, and premature death. Sebelipase alfa (Kanuma) is a recombinant protein enzyme replacement thera py. If approved, it would be the 1st treatment cleared for use in LAL deficiency.

Mutation of the TTR gene can lead to unstable TTR and gener ate amyloid fibrils that are deposited in various organs, causing organ failure. TTR -related amyloidosis is a genetic neurodegenerative disease that can affect the heart and kidneys. It is a systemic disorder resulting in polyneuropathy, autonomic neuropat hy and cardiomyopathy. The disease is usually fatal within a decade in the absence of a liver transplant; patients diagnosed with FAC require combined heart and liver transplants. Tafamidis (Vyndaqel\u00ae) is a purported TTR stabilizer that binds to the TTR pr otein to promote the stabilization of functional tetrameric molecules. This binding is hypothesized to slow formation of misfolded amyloid fibrils and their deposit in organs. In clinical trials, patients with transthyretin familial amyloidoses and familia l polyneuropathy are administered 20 mg oral tafamidis tablets, daily, for up to 18 months. In clinical trials investigating tafamidis for treating familial amyloid cardiomyopathy, patients are administered 20 or 80 mg oral tafamidis tablets, daily, for up to 30 months.

The disorder, also called hypernychthemeral syndrome, can cause disrupted nighttime sleep and excessive daytime sleep to a potentially debilitating degree. It affects between 65,000 and 95,000 people. Over -the-counte r melatonin dietary supplement is sometimes used, though published data on efficacy are very limited. Tasimelteon (Hetlioz) is a melatonin receptor agonist thought to reset the internal body clock in a way similar to normal light - dependent resetting.

Previous research has suggested that during the inflammatory phase of MS, an increase in pathogenic T cells directly contributes to disease progression. Also, researchers hypothesize that the increase in pathogenic T cells is caused by reduced suppression, normally mediated by a combination of T regulatory and T suppressor cells (including interleukin -10-secreting T regulatory 1 cells, CD4+ CD25+ regulatory T cells [Treg], and CD8+ T suppressor cells). NeuroVax, a trivalent T -cell receptor (TCR) peptide vaccine, purportedly treats MS by inducing high frequencies of TCR - reactive T cells, subsequently inducing Foxp3+ Treg cells that can target pathogenic T cel ls. In clinical trials, patients with MS receive monthly injections of NeuroVax into the deltoid muscle, alternating arms each month; each dose of NeuroVax is a prepared in a mixture of the 3 peptides in aqueous solution in a 1:1 ratio with incomplete Freu nd's adjuvant, containing 100 mcg/mL of each peptide, with a nominal volume of 1.1\u00b10.2 mL.

Based on U.S. census data from 2000, the prevalence is approximately 160,000. GCA most commonly affects head arteries, particularly in the temples. Patients with GCA often experience headaches, jaw pain, or vision problems from inflammation. In severe cases, GCA can cause blood clots or arterial swelling leading to blindness, aortic aneurysm, or stroke. It is treated with high -dose corticost eroids to reduce the likelihood of severe symptoms; however, high doses of corticosteroids have side effects, including risk of osteoporosis, high blood pressure, glaucoma, and cataracts. Patients with GCA who have been placed on tapered doses of corticost eroids also often experience relapses. An unmet need exists for effective interventions. Tocilizumab (Actrema) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets interleukin -6 (IL-6) receptor. Elevated levels of IL -6 are hypothesized to indicate GCA. Tocilizu mab purportedly reduces the dosage of corticosteroids needed to treat GCA and may reduce relapse rates in patients who are receiving tapered corticosteroid doses. In clinical trials, tocilizumab is given as an add-on treatment at monthly dosages of either 8 mg/kg or 162 mg for 12 months, along with corticosteroids; tocilizumab dosages are either consistent throughout the study or tapered.

Friedreich's ataxia is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a defect in the frataxin gene, leading to symptoms including ataxia, diabetes, sensorimotor deficiencies, muscle weakness, and heart failure. Leigh syndrome has a primarily autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, but can also display mitochondrial, or maternal, inheritance in 20% to 25% of cases; it can be caused by any of more than 30 DNA mutations and is marked by progressive loss of sensorimotor function, along with respiratory dysfunction. These diseases are increasingly debilitating, severely limiting patients' ability to function independently; disease -related symptoms, particularly cardiac and respirat ory symptoms, are often fatal. FDA- approved interventions for these diseases do not exist; consequently there, is an unmet need for effective treatments. Vatiquinone (EPI -743) is a parabenzoquinone drug purported to treat inherited mitochondria l diseases by augmenting endogenous glutathione biosynthesis, an essential biological process for controlling oxidative stress, an identified biomarker of Friedreich's ataxia and related inherited mitochondrial diseases.

Increased disease p revalence is seen in people of African and Mediterranean descent; about 1 in 500 African -American children have sickle cell anemia. In SCD, sickled red blood cells are more susceptible to oxidative damage and inappropriate adhesion, which can lead to vaso -occlusive crisis (VOC). VOC causes severe pain by obstructing vasculature and requires hospitalization. Patients may progress to thromboembolic events, stroke, organ failure, or early death. VOC is typically managed with hydration and pain medication but c annot be halted. The only FDA -approved treatment for SCD, hydroxyurea, can reduce VOC incidence but is not effective in about 1/3 of adult patients with SCD. Vepoloxamer (MST -188) is a limits adhesion of si ckled cells to each other and vascular endothelium, actions responsible for VOC.

Gelesis100 is a highly absorbent hydrogel containing polymer particles of food materials that expand when in contact with liquid in the stomach. The polymer expands into numerous hydrogel beads in the stomach, giving a \"full\" feeling to suppress hunger. The hydrogel keeps food in the stomach longer, giving stomach acid more time to break down both the food and the hydrogel, which begins to release its water; everything then moves to the small intestine where the gel can re -expand to some extent, slowing the absorption of fatty materials and sugars.

The most common form of hazardous alcohol use, binge drinking, was the direct cause of more than half of those deaths and is also a risk factor for many other adverse health outcomes, including motor -vehicle crashes, suicides, and fetal alcohol syndrome. Binge drinking also encompasses half of the total alcohol consumption in the U.S., and 90% of alcohol consumed by underage youths and young adults. An unmet need exists for effective interventions and delivery methods, addressing these populations, that ef fectively prevent hazardous drinking behaviors and promote responsible attitudes towards alcohol consumption.

A treatment option under study is the use of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) gene therapy to genetically modify autologous T lymphocytes to promote T -cell activation, T -cell proliferation, and immune memory. To generate CTL019, a lentiviral vector is used to transfect autologous T cells with a CAR transgene that consist s of 4 parts: (1) an extracellular domain consisting of an antibody variable chain specific for CD19 (a cell surface marker expressed by CLLs); (2) a hinge region; (3) a costimulatory domain (in this case a portion of CD137); and (4) CD3 - zeta (a signal transduction component of the T -cell receptor). Binding of the extracellular domain of this recombinant protein to CD19 on target cells activates the pathways typically downstream of maj or histocompatibility complex activation and CD137 stimulation, activating a persistent immune response against CD19.

The primary treatment strategy consists of diet ary changes, which are often unsuccessful because strict adherence is required. APOCIIIRx is an antisense drug that inhibits production of apolipoprotein C -III (apoC -III) in the liver. Lower production of apoC -III is linked to reduced levels of triglycerid es and low-density lipoprotein - cholesterol levels `and increased levels of high -density lipoprotein - cholesterol, thus reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease. The drug is intended to avoid side effects of current triglyceride -lowering medications. In clinical trials, APOCIIIRx is being administered subcutaneously as a once -weekly injection of 300 mg.

Although various neurodegenerative conditions, including dementia, MCI, and AD, are closely associated with cognitive decline, many healthy adults advancing towards old age also naturally experience cognitive decline. Investigators hypothesize that tasks that use mental resources can help maintain cognitive functioning, and many noninvasive techniques and tools purportedly address this goal. However, these tools' efficacy is inconsistent across patients, and few have been robustly dem onstrated to prevent decline in patients whose cognitive functioning has already decreased. Brain -computer interface (BCI) systems provide a potential noninvasive tool to reinforce cognitive functioning in healthy older adults and potentially reduce or pre vent cognitive decline in patients with dementia, MCI, AD, or age-related deterioration. These systems directly communicate between patients' brains and a computer training system, via electroencephalograph (EEG) recordings. EEG recordings are processed by the computer to determine patients' attention states and incorporated into training paradigms.

In the U.S., AN has the 3rd -highest lifetime prevalence among eating disorders and has the highest mortality rate among psychiatric illnesses. Epidemiologic studies have also shown that AN is more prevalent in women than men and is the 3rd most common chronic illness among adolescents. Neuroimaging research has demonstrated that patients with AN display deficits in cognitive control, central coherence, and emotional processing. Consequently, many experts consider individual be havior therapy as the standard treatment for AN, although its long -term efficacy has not been established. An unmet need exists for alternative interventions that promote sustained AN symptom management and reduction. The multi -family therapy group (MFTG) approach uses a relational -motivational treatment approach that purportedly addresses intra - and interpersonal disconnections underlying patients' AN symptoms. Within a group treatment environment, therapists can engage patients and their relatives in an i ntegrated effort to develop positive connections and reduce AN symptoms. MFTG consists of sixteen 90 -minute therapy sessions involving patients and family members, conducted over 26 weeks.

Telemedicine (telepsychiatry) -based collaborative care enables remote delivery of psychiatric and psychological care, clinician consultation and pharmacotherapy prescription, and patient management by trained professionals. Using this model, patients in rural locales receive comprehensive, cost-effective, evidence -based mental health services, similar to their more urban -residing counterparts. Telemedicine can also facilitate improved patient adherence and function as an adjunct to face -to- face treatment. In clinical trials, telemedicine is used to deliver 1 of several standard PTSD p sychotherapies (e.g., cognitive processing therapy, cognitive behavior therapy, prolonged exposure); psychotherapy is delivered on the same schedule as standard in -person therapy.

Treatments primarily include stimulants and antidepressants, but these treatments are often not effective and may have significant side effects and potential for abuse. Dasotraline (SEP -225289) is an antidepressant derivative of sibutramine (an appetite suppressant voluntarily withdrawn from the market because of increased risk of cardiovascular events in clinical trials) that functions as a reuptake inhibitor of seroton in, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Because it maintains a stable level in the bloodstream throughout a full day, single dasotraline doses are purported to effectively treat ADHD symptoms daily. In clinical trials, patients are administered dasotraline orall y, once daily, in flexible doses of 4, 6, or 8 mg for up to 12 months.

In the U.S., SE has a prevalence of approxima tely 40 cases per 100,000 persons; an estimated 42,000 of these patients die within 30 days of their 1st SE seizure. Clinically, 2 types of SE are recognized; both can be diagnosed using blood tests, electroencephalography, imaging, and urinalysis. Standar d SE treatment involves aggressive ly applying benzodiazepine, anticonvulsants, barbiturates, or anesthetics; 1 or more of these medications is often successful in eliminating seizures. However, in unresponsive patients with SRSE, continuously administered general anesthesia is required, and these patients face increased risks of infection and death. An unmet need exists for effective interventions for patients with this condition. SAGE -547 is an allosteric GABA -A receptor modulator that purportedly reduces seizures in patients with SRSE. In clinical trials, SAGE -547 is administered intravenously, as an adjunct to current therapies.

As an inherited disorder, HD arises from genetically programmed degeneration of neurons in the brain. Neuronal degeneration results in symptoms including unc ontrolled movements, known as chorea. Chorea is observed in up to 90% of HD patients and is thought to arise from basal ganglia cell degeneration. No cure exists for HD, and only 1 medication, tetrabenazine, is FDA approved for treating chorea; additional pharmacotherapies are needed for this indication. The drug deutetrabenazine (SD -809) purportedly functions as a vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT -2) inhibitor. Investigators hypothesize that deutetrabenazine, which is synthesized by substituting deuterium at specific positions of tetrabenazine's structure, regulates dopamine levels underlying involuntary movement disorders. This compound potentially will provide symptom relief with minimal side effects and reduced drug -drug interactions. In clini cal trials, deutetrabenazine tablets are administered orally for up to 8 weeks, 6 -12 mg, daily. Auspex Pharmaceuticals, Inc., La Jolla, CA Phase III trial ongoing; manufacturer plans to submit new drug application by mid -2015; Nov 2014, FDA granted orpha n drug status ; deutetrabenazine is also under investigation for treating approved to suppr ess chorea associated with HD) Reduced symptoms Improved quality of life IGF-2 peptide conjugated alpha - glucosidase (BMN 701) enzyme for Pompe disease Patients in whom late-onset Pompe disease has been diagnosed Late-onset Pompe diseas e results from a partial deficiency in alpha - glucosidase activity, which causes excessive amounts of lysosomal glycogen to accumulate everywhere. It can cause muscle weakness and respiratory failure. Available enzyme replacement therapy (alglucosidase alfa) may have poor uptake in skeletal muscl e, potentially due to low skeletal muscle expression of the key transporter required for cellular entry of the enzyme. IGF -2 peptide conjugated alpha -glucosidase alternative enzyme replacement therapy . BMN 701 purports to circumvent low skeletal muscle uptake by adding the IGF -2 peptide, which directs the drug to lysosomes to degrade glycogen.

It is a progressive disease caused by an inherited mutation in the transt hyretin gene ( TTR). FAC is often fatal. Patients may recover after a heart transplant, but that option is not available for many patients. An effective pharmacologic treatment could reduce or postpone the need for transplantation. Revusiran (ALN -TTRsc) is an infused RNAi therapeutic that purportedly targets TTR. It purportedly prevents pathogenic TTR deposits in peripheral tissues, including dorsal root ganglia, sciatic nerve, stomach, and intestines, by silencing the TTR gene and reducing TTR serum levels.

About 1 million patients receive an AKI diagnosis each year in the U.S., all of whom experience some permanent loss of kidney function. Causal factors for AKI include cardiac and/or vascular surgery, inflammatory disease, trauma, or the administration of contrast dye for imaging. AKI is common in hospitalized patients and also has a po or prognosis, with mortality ranging from 10% to 80%. Treatment options for AKI are limited, with no pharmacological therapy approved for its treatment . THR -184 is a small peptide that selectively activates the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type II rece ptor and Smad (small mothers against decapentaplegic ) proteins (a family of signal transducers) , responsible for regulatin g growth, differentiation, chemotaxis, and apoptosis of various cell types such as epithelial, mesenchymal, hematopoietic, and neurona l cells. By activating these receptors, this therapy may serve as a preventive and therapeutic option for patients in whom AKI has been diagnosed. THR -184 does not have bone morphogenetic activity. It is given by intravenous infusion at a high dose before surgery and a lower dose after surgery. Exact dosage is still under study.

However, fecal transplantation requires identifying and screening appropriate donors, which can be labor intensive and limits the diffusion of the procedure to a small number of specialty facilities. SER -109 is a combination of spores from pure bacterial strains identified using the manufacturer's proprietary Microbiome Therapeutics platform technology. It is thought to induce environmental changes in the gut microbiota that restore a healthy state in patients with recurrent CDI. SER - 109 also purportedly induces sustained changes in the gut flora that could prevent CDI recurrence.

HDV infection leads to more severe liver disease than HBV alone and is associated with accelerated fibrosis, cancer, and liver failure. No treatments exist for HDV infection. Lonafarnib purportedly inhibits farnesyl transferase, a host -cell enzyme involved in a process called prenylation, which is essential to HDV replication. Because prenylation is a host -cell process, lonafarnib is thought to have a higher barrier to resistance than direct -acting antiviral agents. Lonafarnib is administered orally, 100 -200 mg daily, for other indications.

Clinicians often have insufficient time to repair an injury and stop the bleeding befo re the patient has gone too long without oxygen . Induced hypothermia is a well -established tool to preserve function during procedures in which a patient's oxygen supply is interrupted. A new procedure under study, called emergency preservation and resusci tation (EPR), uses this concept for trauma victims. The patient's body is flushed with ice -cold 0.9% sodium chloride through an arterial catheter in the descending thoracic aorta and cooled to about 50 F (10 C). The patient can be maintained in this stat e for about 1 hour while surgeons repair the injury. Using a cardiopulmonary bypass machine with a heat exchanger, blood is reintroduced to the patient gradually to prevent ischemia -reperfusion injuries.

Inaccurate estimations of blood loss during surgery can lead to patient complications, morbidity, mortality, and increased costs. Also, blood used for transfusions (as a result of inaccurately estimating a large amount of blood lost during surgery) is scarce and expensive. To address this limitation, a developer has created a mobile medical platform that is intended to be used with the iPad during surge ry. Using the program and iPad camera, an OR team member scans surgical surfaces (e.g., surgical sponges ) that are covered in blood, then sends the image to the \"cloud.\" Once the image is on the cloud server , the application's algorithms (similar to those used in facial recognition software) determine and estimate the amount of blood present in that sample, thereby potentially offering clinicians a more accurate assessment of the amount of blood the patient has lost.

No treatments for CRPC are available that ta rget MET, which may be responsible for prostate cancer drug resistance in patients treated with current receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Cabozantinib (Cometriq\u00ae) is an oral, small kinase inhibitor that targets MET and vascul ar endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor 2 (VEGFR2). MET plays key roles in cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis. Overexpression of the hepatocyte growth factor ligand of MET and activation of the MET pathway supports tumors. Addit ionally, VEGFR2 and MET allow tumors to overcome hypoxia and stimulate angiogenesis. Finally, VEGF and MET also appear to stimulate osteoclasts and osteoblasts, thus showing potential for treating bone metastasis. Selective anti -VEGF therapies do not inhib it MET, which may be responsible for tumor evasiveness and drug resistance in patients who receive VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitors, making MET/VEGF co -inhibition an emerging target in cancer therapy.

CTD is classified as an autism spectrum disorder and a form of x -linked mental retardation; it is also 1 of 3 general cerebral creatine deficiency syndro mes. CTD is caused by a defect in the SLC6A8 gene that encodes the transporter protein necessary for transporting creatine across cell membranes and the blood -brain barrier. This defect results in deficient creatine levels in the brain. Male patients with CTD exhibit autistic behavior, epilepsy, and severe developmental delays, including speech delays and intellectual disability. Female CTD patients may be asymptomatic or exhibit mild behavioral problems and learning problems. CTD also represents the 2nd -largest cause of autism, after fragile X syndrome. No approved treatments exist for CTD. Cyclocreatine (LUM -001), a repurposed small -molecule analogue of creatine, purportedly treats CTD by providing a source of biofunctional creatine capable of crossing the blood -brain barrier.

The manufacturer produces vaccines with proprietary Ii -Key hybrid technology that uses a peptide fragment derived from the invariant chain (Ii) linked to CD4+ T -cell epitopes from the Ebola virus. These hybrid peptides purportedly induce efficient antigen presentation and strong CD4+ T -cell responses, which are purportedly required for developing protective antibody responses against Ebola virus. The vaccine could be delivered as an oral mist and may be administered with other vaccines designed to induce antibodies against the Ebola virus.

Better metho ds to diagnose and guide judicious therapy are needed. The MALDI Biotyper purportedly uses high throughput matrix -assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI -TOF) mass spectrometry to guide infection diagnosis and monitoring. It purportedly takes less time than conventional culture and biochemical testing to identify bacteria. The MALDI Biotyper system is purported to be capable of identifying more than 4,600 microbial isolates from gram -negative or gram -positive bacteria, yeasts, multicellu lar fungi, and mycobacteria. For sample preparation, a portion of an isolated colony is placed onto a target plate, covered with a chemical matrix, and loaded into the instrument. The sample is pulsed by a laser, converting the sample into an ionic gas com posed of small proteins, peptides, and other molecules. In the ionization chamber, positively charged molecules move through an electric field at a rate based on their mass -to-charge ratios. Each organism has a unique rate signature, which can be compared by the device with reference spectra in the MALDI Biotyper library, leading to rapid identification. Additionally, the device allows users to generate their own database entries to include regional isolates. The device is purportedly capable of running hig h-throughput workflow and could be automated. Once the instrument is loaded, identifications can typically be performed in less than 1 minute, compared with hours to days for conventional methods. The device requires minimal sample preparation and offers l ow consumables cost. Bruker Corp., Billerica, MA Nov 2013, FDA granted 510(k) marketing approval for MALDI Biotyper CA system for identifying gram negative bacteria Culture methods Microscopy Polymerase chain reaction Rapid disease detection Fewer cases of antibacterial resistance Improved treatment outcomes MALDI Biotyper is intended to be used in clinical microbiology laboratories and not as a point -of-care test. Additionally, the test is used in combination with existing testing methods to identify pathogenic organisms, so offers only incremental difference.

HIV -drug resistance, high lifelong cost of therapy, and adverse events continue to suggest that prophylactic HIV measures be pursued for individuals at high risk of c ontracting such an infection. Maraviroc (Selzentry\u00ae) is antagonist. CCR -5 is expressed on the surface of T cells and has been identified as 1 of the 2 co - receptors needed for HIV to enter host cells. By preventing HIV from entering T cells, maraviroc could prevent HIV infection; thus, the drug is considered an entry inhibitor. For this indication, it is intended to be used as preexposure prophylaxis for people at high risk of contracting an HIV infection. Administe red orally, 300 mg, once daily.

UC is typically treated with anti -inflammatory drugs with varied success, and investigators have not found a long -term cure or strategy besides surgery to prevent periodic disease flares. HMPL -004 is der ived from the Andrographis paniculata plant. The extract purportedly inhibits multiple cellular targets including specific tumor necrosis factors (TNFs) and interleukin cytokines. HMPL - 004 also purportedly inhibits the activation of specific cellular prote ins associated with inflammation. Specific cytokine inhibition is thought to disrupt the inflammatory signal transduction pathway, thus suppressing UC. HMPL -004 purportedly is associated with fewer adverse events than available inflammatory cytokine inhibi tors.

General EDs can be uncomfortable or unsafe for elderly patients, and risk of hospital readmission and drug interactions are high in this population. Additionally, EDs do not always have access to geriatrician staff members. EDs for seniors are designed specifically for the elderly population. Structural, safety, and comfort changes include wider hallways (for wheelchairs), hand rails, different lighting systems, easier -to-read visuals, pre ssure -reducing beds, and alarms for wandering patients. Care teams and care delivery are redesigned to include clinicians and nurses with special training in geriatric medicine, including education on issues related to ageism and sensory appreciation in th e elderly (so that these skills can be used to communicate more effectively with older adults and their caregivers). The different approach to care involves being more thorough with each patient and conducting on a routine basis assessments that typically are made only as needed (e.g., cognitive exams to detect issues that normally would go unchecked in other EDs). Senior -specific EDs have been opened across the U.S. 1st senior -specific ED launched in 2008; about 50 senior - specific EDs exist and at leas t 150 are in development in U.S.; multigroup task force released Geriatric Emergency Department Guidelines in Jan 2014 General EDs Improved health outcomes for seniors Improved quality of life Tracked nearly 2 years and is diffusing broadly in U.S., as evidenced by release of implementation guidelines for these EDs and implementation of senior -specific EDs by many health systems.

Reasons for this include not taking medications as prescribed, improper diet, lack of awareness of heart failure signs, and lack of planned followup with a doctor. These issues are particularly salient for rural populations, such as Native Americans, who often don't have access to cars or o ther transportation, running water, or electricity. The Care Beyond Walls and Wires program is intended to overcome these barriers and reduce hospital readmissions. The program uses smart phones and in - home monitoring equipment to collect data on weight, blood pressure, activity, and other important health indicators and transfer the data to nurses at a medical center. The nurses monitor the data daily and work with physicians to detect declines in a patient's health status and intervene early, potentially reducing unnecessary travel, physician office visits, costs, and hospital readmissions. The cell phones and monitoring equipment are donated by manufacturers. Rural residents without electricity use solar -powered batteries. Patients are enrolled in the pro gram for at least 31 days.
