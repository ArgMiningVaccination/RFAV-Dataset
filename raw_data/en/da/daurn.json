Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. [Policy](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/advertising) Many of us are familiar with the concept of [acupuncture](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/4767-acupuncture), the ancient Chinese method of healthcare involving thin needles, which are inserted into various points in the body to treat or prevent illness. But far fewer have heard of acupressure, a complementary treatment to acupuncture. But it doesn't involve any needles. Both acupuncture and acupressure rely on stimulating hundreds of \"acu-points\" along the body's 14 meridians, or energy-carrying channels. People use them as an adjunct to traditional medicine or seek out these therapies if medication doesn't work. They can be used to treat stress and anxiety, [migraines](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/4-natural-drug-free-ways-to-fight-your-migraine-headaches/), [allergies](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23420231), nausea, [vomiting](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/what-causes-vomiting-and-what-should-you-do-about-it/), pain and more. You can do acupressure yourself, at home or work. You simply apply pressure with the fingers or another small object to the same points targeted through acupuncture. Acupressure for allergies If you have allergy or sinus problems, using acupressure only takes about six minutes. The video below shows exactly where to press with a simple demonstration. There are two places on your face where you can apply gentle, firm pressure. The first one involves using the index fingers of each hand and pressing at the base of your nose. This relieves pressure in your sinuses. The second involves pressing at the top of each of your inner eyebrows. Doing this helps relieve pressure in your forehead. You should spend about three minutes holding each point. Watch this video to see how to do it. Acupressure is easy to learn, safe, effective and costs nothing. It can help relieve symptoms of sinus pressure and allergies. "}
