Here are answers to some commonly asked questions. Q. Why do you make changes to the drug list? A. Cigna regularly reviews and updates the prescription drug list. We make changes for many reasons - like when new medications become available or are no longer available, or when medication prices change. We try to give you many options to choose from to treat your health condition. These changes may include: Moving a medication to a lower cost tier. Moving a brand medication to a higher cost tier when a generic becomes available. Moving a medication to a higher cost tier and/or no longer covering a medication. Adding extra coverage requirements to a medication. When we make a change that affects the coverage of a medication you're taking, we let you know before it happens. This way, you have time to talk with your doctor about your options. Q. Why doesn't my plan cover certain medications? A. To help lower your overall health care costs, your plan doesn't cover certain high-cost brand medications because there are lower-cost, covered alternatives which are used to treat the same condition. Meaning, the alternative works the same or similar to the non-covered medication. If you're taking a medication that your plan doesn't cover and your doctor feels an alternative medication isn't right for you, he or she can ask Cigna to consider approving coverage. Your plan may also exclude certain medications or products from coverage. This is known as a \"plan (or benefit) exclusion.\" For example, your plan excludes medications that aren't approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). With excluded medications, there's no option to receive coverage through Cigna's coverage review process. Q. How do you decide which medications to cover? A. The Prescription Drug List is managed by the Business Decision Team, which makes, subject to the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee's review and approval of the Prescription Drug List, coverage tier placement decisions of Prescription Drugs or Related Supplies and/ or applies utilization management requirements to certain Prescription Drugs or Related Supplies. Your Policy/Service Agreement coverage tiers may contain Prescription Drugs or Related Supplies that are Generic Drugs, Brand Drugs or Specialty Medications. Placement of any Prescription Drug or Related Supplies in a specific tier, and application of utilization management requirements to a Prescription Drug, depends on a number of clinical and economic factors. Clinical factors include, without limitation, the P&T Committee's evaluations of the place in therapy, or relative safety or relative efficacy of the Prescription Drug or Related Supplies, and economic factors include, without limitation, the cost and/or available rebates for Prescription Drugs or Related Supplies. Whether a particular Prescription Drug or Related Supply is appropriate for You or any of Your Family Member(s), regardless of its eligibility coverage under Your Policy/ Service Agreement is a determination that is made by You (or Your Family Member) and the prescribing Physician. Q. Why do certain medications need approval before my plan will cover them? A. The review process helps to make sure you're receiving coverage for the right medication, at the right cost, in the right amount and for the right situation. Q. How do I know if I'm taking a medication that needs approval? A. Log in to the myCigna App or myCigna.com , or check your plan materials, to learn more about how your plan covers your medications. If your medication has a PA or ST next to it, your medication needs approval before your plan will cover it. If it has a QL next to it, you may need approval depending on the amount you're filling. If it has AGE next to it, you may need approval depending on the covered age range for the medication. Q. What types of medications typically need approval? A. Medications that: May be unsafe when combined with other medications Have lower-cost, equally effective alternatives available Should only be used for certain health conditions Are often misused or abused Q. What types of medications typically have quantity limits? A. Medications that: Are often taken in amounts larger than, or for longer than, may be appropriate Are often misused or abused 35Q. What types of medications require Step Therapy? A. The Cigna Step Therapy program includes medications used to treat the following common medical conditions: Allergies Asthma/COPD Cardiovascular health Diabetes High cholesterol Mental health Overactive bladder/bladder problems Stomach acid/heartburn/ulcer Q. Why does my medication have an age requirement? A. Some medications are only considered clinically appropriate if you're within a certain age range. Q. How do I get approval (prior authorization) for my medication? A. Ask your doctor's office to contact Cigna so we can start the coverage review process. They know how the review process works and will take care of everything for you. In case the office asks, they can download a request form from Cigna's provider portal at cignaforhcp.com. Cigna will review information your doctor provides to make sure your medication meets coverage guidelines. We'll send you and your doctor a letter with the decision and next steps. It can take 1-5 days to hear from us. You can always check with your doctor's office to find out if a decision's been made. If you meet guidelines, your medication will be approved for coverage. If you don't meet guidelines, you and your doctor can appeal the decision by sending Cigna a written request stating why the medication should be covered. Q. What happens if I try to fill a prescription that needs approval but I don't get approval ahead of time? A. When your pharmacist tries to fill your prescription, he or she will see that the medication needs prior approval. Because you didn't get approval ahead of time, your plan coverage won't apply. Meaning, your plan won't cover the cost of your medication. You can choose to pay its full cost out-of-pocket directly to the pharmacy (the cost can't be applied to your annual deductible or out-of-pocket maximum). Q. What happens if I try to fill a prescription that has a quantity limit? A. Your pharmacist will only fill the amount your plan covers. If you want to fill more than what's allowed, your doctor's office will need to contact Cigna to request approval for coverage.Q. Are all of the medications on this drug list approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)? A. Yes. All medications are approved by the FDA. Q. Are medications newly approved by the FDA covered on my drug list? A. Newly approved medications may not be covered on your drug list for the first six months after they receive approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). These include, but are not limited to, medications, medical supplies and/or devices covered under standard pharmacy benefit plans. We review all newly approved medications to see if they should be covered - and if so, on what tier. If your doctor feels a currently covered medication isn't right for you, he or she can ask Cigna to consider approving coverage of the newly approved medication. Q. Which medications are covered under the health care reform law? A. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), commonly referred to as \"health care reform,\" was signed into law on March 23, 2010. Under this law, certain preventive medications (including some over-the-counter products) may be available to you at no cost-share ($0), depending on your plan. Log in to the myCigna App or myCigna.com , or check your plan materials, to learn more about how your plan covers preventive medications. You can also view the PPACA No Cost-Share Preventive Medications drug list at Cigna.com/ifp-drug-list . For more information about health care reform, go to www.informedonreform.com or Cigna.com . Q. How can I find out how much I'll pay for a specific medication? A. When you and your doctor are considering the right medication for your treatment, knowing how much it costs, what lower-cost alternatives are available, and which pharmacies offer the best prices can help you avoid surprises. Log in to the myCigna App or myCigna.com and use the Price a Medication tool to see how much your medication costs before you get to the pharmacy counter - or, even before you leave your doctor's office.1 Q. How can I save money on my prescription medications? A. You may be able to save money by switching to a medication that's on a lower tier (ex. preferred generic or generic) or by filling a 90-day supply, if your plan allows. You should talk with your doctor to find out if one of these options may work for you. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) (cont)36Q. Do generics work the same as brand-name medications? A. Yes. A generic medication works in the same way and provides the same clinical benefit as its brand- name version.2 Generic and brand-name medications have the same active ingredients, strength, dosage form, effectiveness, quality, and safety. Q. What are the differences between generic and brand-name medications? A. The medications may look different. For example, generics may have a different shape, size or color than the brand-name medication. They may also have a different flavor, contain different preservatives, come in different packaging and/or with different labeling and may expire at different times. Generics may look different than the brand name, but they're just as safe and effective. Generics typically cost much less than brand-name medications - in some cases, up to 85% less.2 Just because generics cost less than brands, it doesn't mean they're lower-quality medications. Q. My pharmacy isn't in my plan's network. Can I continue to fill my prescriptions there? A. To get coverage under your plan, you'll need to switch to a pharmacy in your plan's network. Q. Can I fill my prescriptions by mail? A. Yes, your plan allows fills through Cigna's home delivery and in-network retail pharmacies.
