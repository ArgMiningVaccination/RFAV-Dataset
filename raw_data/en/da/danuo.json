PREFACE A COUPLE OF NOTES For people looking for medical counsel: Although the information, ideas, and perspectives contained in this book are based on Ayurvedic, Traditional Chinese, or Western allopathic principles or studies, and even though\u2014in the case of Ayurvedic or Traditional Chinese Medicine\u2014such perspectives have been employed for thousands of years, no part of this book should be taken or construed as medical diagnosis or treatment. One significant component of Eastern medical philosophy is that each person has individual, unique needs, so no single recommendation, no matter how sound, is sound for every individual. For any medical condition or personal medical, herbal, dietary, or lifestyle advice, always consult with a qualified health-care practitioner. I'm not just saying this for legal reasons. There is always more to medicine than any one practitioner can know, not to mention more to an individual's health than an author can address without ever having even met that person. It is up to each of us to do our own search, find what works for us, and implement it. This book was born out of my own attempts to understand the sea of information available on women's health. The conclusions I draw are not facts. They are educated opinions. For numbers and statistic buffs and critics: The data in many of the studies in this book describe the increased risk for an entire population\u2014not the increased risk for an individual woman. Taken as the latter, they would be scarier. Taken as the former, they are still compelling numbers. For Western-trained physicians: In my travels in the world, I haven't found any group who loves the perspective that this book presents more than you do. While Western medicine describes each individual hormone, Eastern medicine provides a context for understanding how they interact. This is heady, exciting stuff. For everyone else: You don't have to have any background in either Western or Eastern medicine to understand the concepts in this book. Simple concepts are powerful and simply lay the framework for understanding complicated material in an easy and even enjoyable way. Bon voyage. 1 The Stress Epidemic A couple years ago I spotted a bizarre headline in the New York Times. THE NEW MODERN WOMAN, AMBITIOUS AND FEEBLE,1 it read. The article criticized certain popular TV shows for creating heroines who were driven, neurotic, anxiety prone, and undernourished. The author of the article decried these shows, concerned that viewers would emulate the shows' \"ambitious and feeble\" role models. Although the headline was obviously a generalization about American women, it was not without merit. I am a Western woman who is also a doctor of Eastern medicine. Over the years I have seen that the medical problems of most women who come to me are rooted in a hormonal imbalance brought on by doing too much while getting too little physical and emotional nourishment, not unlike the feeble heroines. What's more, their hormones have been out of whack for an extended period of time. I'm not just talking about menopausal women. I mean women of all ages, women whose medical problems range from painful periods, mood swings, fatigue, and insomnia to infertility, uterine fibroids, hot flashes, heart disease, and osteoporosis. Whereas Western medicine emphasizes the separate domains and functions of various kinds of hormones in the body, Eastern medicine emphasizes the context within which they exist and how they relate to each other. Combining Eastern and Western perspectives, we see two major types of hormones that affect a woman's health: stress hormones and sex hormones. Having the right balance of these hormones gives us plenty of energy, deeper sleep, healthier menstrual cycles, happier dispositions, easier menopauses, healthier hearts, stronger bones, and much, much more. When we experience stress (self-induced or otherwise), our body releases extra stress hormones until the \"danger\" resolves itself, thus throwing off our hormonal balance. When our whole lives are stressful, this imbalance becomes chronic. Healing begins when we start to live the life we really want to be living. Then we have less stress and the levels of stress hormones in our bloodstream drop. When our stress hormones are not rampant, our sex hormones have a better chance to work the way they are supposed to, and we experience the well-being that comes from having balanced hormones. How Did We Get into This Situation? Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need. \u2014FIGHT CLUB, BASED ON THE NOVEL BY CHUCK PALAHNIUK Many modern women mistake the feeling of being under stress for having energy, and putting ballast in the stomach for getting real sustenance. We think a woman has a lot of energy, for example, if she is a soccer mom and a full-time career woman. She starts running at dawn and doesn't rest until late evening, if she rests at all. Perhaps she grabs some fast food, a doughnut, or even healthy food, but she bolts it down to ground her so she can continue running. She's the human equivalent of the Energizer Bunny. She is driven by the need (or \"ambition,\" as the headline writer called it) to do it all. But from the perspective of Eastern medicine, her health is becoming fragile, maybe even \"feeble.\" The Eastern concept of energy is quite different from that of our Western Energizer Bunny. In the East, energy is called qi (also spelled chi) or prana and it is the life force. Have you ever seen someone practicing tai chi or qi gong? If so, you've seen how the practitioner expends her energy\u2014her life force\u2014economically and efficiently, as an extension of her peace of mind. She nourishes her life force with whole and freshly cooked food that agrees with her, by breathing clean air, and by keeping good company. She has balance in her life. This balance, in turn, affects her life: Her equanimity is reflected in her hormonal levels. They, too, are in balance. She is happy and her health is hearty. Her life force, or qi, is strong and its flow unimpeded. We'll go deeper into the concept of qi or prana later. (You can also see Appendix B for more discussion of prana). For now, let's get back to our poor Energizer Bunny. She needs help. It is one thing to go through a crunch period of high stress for a day, a week, a month, even two months. This happens to all of us, and our bodies, minds, and spirits can recover from it. We might even be able to tolerate it for a year or two. When we go through stressful times, we survive them by living on \"credit,\" borrowing from our reserves of good health. When the stressful time passes, we regroup and rebuild. Trouble arises when stress is prolonged and our reserves become too depleted. We no longer have the resources to combat the effects of the excess stress hormones in our systems. An overabundance of stress hormones outweighs the nourishing effects of our sex hormones and leads to the breakdown of bones, skin, muscles, and brain tissue. This is when we start feeling seriously off-kilter and require serious repair. While there is always hope that we can regain our health, it will be an uphill climb. It is far easier to maintain our health than regain it. Eastern medicine teaches us that humans are an aspect of nature and are governed by her laws. Our minds are individual mirrors of the cosmic consciousness and our bodies are microcosms that reflect the state of the world around us. What happens to the one is reflected in the other. For example, look at what happens in the macrocosm of the economic world. When we experience financial crisis, often borne of spending money we don't have year after year, it becomes a sticky prospect to fully regain economic health. In the microcosm of the world that is a woman's body, it is not uncommon for her to outspend her energetic and nutritional resources. Between holding down a job, maintaining relationships, and caring for her family, a woman often blows through the energy she \"earns\" from sleep, good food, and good company. Her daily needs repeatedly outpace her daily intake of energy. The result? She has to dip into her reserves, which depletes her core nourishment. This is no more sustainable than spending money we don't have. Just as there comes a time when we can no longer ignore financial debt, there comes a time when energy deficit becomes unsustainable. When that happens, it is not only economies that need bailouts. Our bodies and minds do, too. How does hormonal imbalance come into this picture? When a woman is stressed, her body releases stress hormones. These hormones make her hypervigilant and they key up her nervous system until it is hypersensitive. In this state, she begins to experience even benign events as critical situations. This, in turn, stimulates the release of even more stress hormones. A vicious cycle begins. There is no easy resolution to the stress, because it is caused by not only external factors but ongoing internal factors, such as the woman's desire to meet all of her family's needs, her boss's needs, her friends' needs, and her own expectations. The long-term oversaturation of a woman's cells by stress hormones throws her hormonal balance out of whack and triggers a host of maladies. True, some stressors are beyond our control: the death of loved ones, natural disasters, or the loss of a job, for example. But others stressors are ours to relieve, such as the stress created by our worldviews and values, our choices about what we deem essential or desirable in our lives, and the efforts we make to achieve those things. Credit problems are initiated in part by the belief that we need more than we can afford. To acquire or achieve those things, we put ourselves under stress so routinely that it becomes habitual. And as with all habits, we stop noticing we are doing it. We become so chronically stressed, we may not even realize it's not our natural state. Maybe we know intellectually that our lives are stressful and need changing. Maybe we know this physically, as our bodies send us distress signals like headaches, irritable bowels, sleeplessness, hot flashes, feelings of tightness in our throats or chests, or overwrought emotions. Maybe we hear these pleas from our bodies, but we don't know how to stop running, pushing, overreaching ourselves. We are afraid that if we stop, something terrible will happen. We'll lose our jobs. Our lovers will leave us. Our families will collapse. Our personal worlds will come crashing down around our ears. So we keep going, going, going. And our hormonal balance becomes the victim. Are We Talking About You? Try this little quiz. Check the things that apply to you. * Do you jump when the phone rings? * Do you feel anxiety about checking your mailbox? * Do you dwell on the many things that could go wrong later today, later this week, month, or year? * Do you commonly feel anxiety, stress, or worry for no particular reason? * Do you commonly feel anxiety, stress, or worry for any reason? * Do you commonly have anxiety about family members? * Do you have panic attacks? * Do you have depression? * Are you exposed to any environmental pollutants or toxins, like smelly paints, plastics, industrial plants, city pollution, new construction, or renovation projects? * Do you experience any of the following symptoms associated with your menstrual cycle: headaches, mood swings, acne, bloating, constipation, heavy or scanty bleeding, painful cramping, irregular periods, pain at ovulation, or bleeding between cycles? * Do you use synthetic hormone therapy of any kind, like birth control pills, fertility drugs, or hormone replacement therapy for menopausal symptoms? * Do you have hot flashes, insomnia, heart palpitations, accelerated heartbeat, thyroid trouble of any kind, low immunity, infertility, heart disease, osteoporosis, cancer, diabetes, adrenal burnout, or endocrine disorders? If you answered yes to even one of these questions, it is likely your hormonal balance is affected. To persevere on our busy course doesn't usually require courage. It takes an overly developed sense of responsibility\u2014or a tendency to hope that everything will get better even if we don't do anything differently. What really takes courage is to stop\u2014stop running, stop pushing, stop trying to please everyone, stop outspending our reserves. Just stop. Stop and begin to live the life we really want to be living. When we do, I have found that our worlds do not come crashing down. On the contrary, if we take little steps to slow our pace and have more time, we find life becomes more enjoyable, even easier; and we begin to gain the confidence to slow things down further. The downward cycle becomes an upward spiral that gains momentum and delivers us into a life saturated with more joy than stress, more meaning than emptiness, and more health than disorder. How to Change Course The first step in achieving hormonal balance is to understand it. Most people, including doctors, are confused about hormones. The available information is at once exhaustive and conflicting. Health professionals who want to understand how hormones affect nearly every aspect of our health almost have to make it an extra part-time job. However, there is a simple way to grasp what these important biochemicals do. Basically, hormones can be separated into two easy-to-understand categories, which in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) are called yin and yang. We will look at these in Part I. My point here is, you won't have to learn anything complex or scientific. This may sound like I am reducing a complicated reality to a simplistic conclusion. But consider this: The phenomenally complicated mechanisms of computer programming can be boiled down to a sequence of zeros and ones. Zeros and ones. Like yin and yang, zeros and ones are two opposites that together describe and create something incredibly complex. Anyone who insists that hormones are extremely complicated is wrong. Einstein once said, \"If you can't explain a concept to a six-year-old, you don't fully understand it.\" I'd add, \"Or you're trying to get someone to buy something\"\u2014like hormone-replacement therapy, or even herbs and other remedies that offer only Band-Aids, not cures. What is the cure? The secret is, there's no big secret to it. It is a general tendency of a student new to Eastern medicine to suspect that the real secrets of health lie in complicated solutions\u2014perhaps an ancient recipe requiring the ash of a rare gem mixed with powder of an expensive root. It sometimes takes years of training and a good deal of experience to learn that the secrets are in the basics. There are three pillars that support our health and happiness. These are our diet, our lifestyle (including exercise), and how we manage stress. When there is a crack in any of these pillars, disease can creep in and take root. Of course, changing our habits, even to balance our hormones and regain our health, isn't a piece of cake. Literally (usually) or figuratively. But it's not complicated or hard to learn. And it's really, really worth it. One of the benefits of improving our habits is, we can often then avoid drugs and surgery. There is no question that there are times when they are crucial. They save lives. But surgery can have complications and drugs often have harmful side effects. You can end up in more trouble than you started out with. For example, in 2002, the Journal of the American Medical Association reported that in U.S. hospitals alone, as many as 106,000 people were dying every year as a direct result of adverse reactions to properly prescribed drugs. This didn't include the astounding numbers of deaths caused as a result of properly performed surgery, poorly performed surgery, or poorly prescribed drugs.2 The fact that correctly prescribed drugs and treatments can cause illness and death in disturbing numbers might seem to violate the \"do no harm\" part of the Hippocratic oath. They are routinely used as first-response strategies, rather than using lifestyle, diet, and other less invasive tools. In the original Hippocratic oath, along with the doing-no-harm part, Hippocrates swears to \"prescribe regimens for the good of my patients according to my ability and my judgment.\" Eastern medicine is all about healthy regimens. While there are certainly appropriate times for surgical or pharmacological intervention and natural herbs or remedies, we lean on them too often when we could achieve the same or better results\u2014and without negative side effects\u2014by practicing Eastern medicine, which addresses physical and emotional maladies first with lifestyle and dietary changes. When we look at the Western science on hormones and then consider them from an Eastern medical perspective, some insights become very clear: Hormonal balance is essential to just about every aspect of women's health. Sex hormones and stress hormones are often misunderstood in a sea of conflicting and narrowly defined descriptions. Hormones can be understood easily, using the Chinese principles of yin and yang (or the corresponding terms in Ayurveda)3 to describe how they work and interact. If we understand the effects of excess stress and poor nourishment, we can make more informed choices, change the direction of our lives, and regain health and happiness. The Theory Behind the Stress Epidemic and This Book Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine each have a set of fundamental principles and theories upon which they rely for diagnosis and treatment, and to describe the human body. Just as French or Spanish are different languages used to describe the same reality, Ayurveda and TCM are different languages that describe a reality they fundamentally see the same way. It is beyond the scope of this book to introduce all fundamental principles of Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine. To do them all justice would require more page real estate than is feasible for this book, and to do more than a cursory job of it would introduce questions and confusion that would detract from our focus. (However, if you'd like a brief overview of both systems, see Appendix B.) The purpose of the various theories is to explain different possible conditions and phenomenon. One theory may best explain one malady, another may more elegantly describe a different malady or aspect of reality. In this book, we will be exploring the roles of stress and rejuvenation in hormones and women's health. There is no theory more applicable to these subjects than the one that underlies the relationship of duality. This relationship is described beautifully in both TCM and Ayurveda, and the theory behind it serves as the foundation for the perspective presented in this book. Fundamentally, the relationship of duality is one of substance to energy, of passivity versus activity, of archetypal feminine versus masculine qualities. Respectively, these forces are called yin and yang in TCM, and santarpana or brmhana and apatarpana or langhana in Ayurveda. The TCM and Ayurvedic terms are synonymous but I'll use yin and yang in this book, as these are more familiar to, and easier to pronounce (yin rhymes with \"in\" and yang with \"long,\" not \"hang\") for Western audiences than are their Ayurvedic equivalents. The theory of yin and yang is distinctly understandable framework from which to understand stress, hormones, and the condition of the body and mind. It configures the quagmire of hormonal information into a construction that is easily navigated and feels surprisingly like common sense. It offers a thoroughly practical way to address imbalances, one you will be able to start using even before finishing this book. As practical as they are, you don't have to believe in the concepts of yin and yang to benefit from this book. You can look at them as shorthand to describe two different types of complex biochemical activities at work in your body and mind. These activities have been researched and meticulously documented in Western medicine. What I am offering is a way of understanding them that is easy to grasp. As we get into the story of how hormones control health, it will be much simpler to understand hormones as either yin hormones or yang hormones than to memorize the names of the hundreds of hormones that flood our bodies, the glands that secrete them, and the role each hormone plays. How This Book Works This book is in three parts. In Part I, we'll talk about yin and yang, how hormones work and, specifically, about what the sex and stress hormones do. This allows us to understand the root causes of our problems and why we crash. In Part II, we'll look at the medical problems women suffer as a result of hormonal imbalance. I'll present the general Western medical approach, discuss its value, and explain how Eastern medicine would resolve these issues. (When I use the term \"Eastern medicine,\" I am referring to both Traditional Chinese Medicine and Ayurveda.) When possible I'll also suggest some general things you can choose to do yourself for these specific ailments. In Part III, we'll look at the basic tools to balance hormones through nutrition and lifestyle changes, including specific steps you can take. Obviously, it is beyond the scope of this book to prescribe for you individually, but Part III offers some nearly universal information and practices that are good for almost anybody. Sometimes universal steps are all that are needed, but if further tailoring of your diet or lifestyle is required for your particular situation, you can learn through self-study, by having a consultation with a practitioner of TCM or Ayurveda, or by taking a course. Whether you are already in a medical profession or are new to the study of medicine, you can find books, online courses, and other educational opportunities for learning these systems in Appendix A. This book will give you a foundation and framework to maximize the benefit of those resources so you can get started rebalancing your hormones and reclaiming your life. Take-Home Messages from This Chapter Understanding how hormones work is quite straightforward when you look at them in terms of Eastern medicine. Balancing your hormones isn't rocket science. Expecting your health-care practitioner to give you the best advice on hormones is risky business. I have never met one who didn't admit to being confused about hormones. Anytime you take a pill to cure one thing, you cause something else to shift and risk getting side effects, sometimes pretty nasty ones. As a culture, we often ignore the fundamental causes of health and illness, and focus instead on how to fund drugs and surgery. Our health-care system really pays more attention to disease than to health. Of the $2.1 trillion spent in 2008 on medical care, ninety-five cents of every dollar was used to treat disease, not prevent it.4 Genre: - On Sale - Mar 22, 2011 - Page Count - 352 pages - Publisher [Da Capo Lifelong Books](https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/imprint/perseus/hachette-books/da-capo-lifelong-books/) - ISBN-13 - 9780738214993 Newsletter Signup By clicking 'Sign Up,' I acknowledge that I have read and agree to Hachette Book Group's "}
