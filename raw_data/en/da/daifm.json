[Publications: Publications referenced agency.] Implemented: Mackenzie G * BCE From: PURNELL Mackenzie G * BCE Sent: Thursday, June 16, 2022 6:27 AM To: PURNELL * BCE Subject: Spinal screening From: KAWAOKA Craig * BCE < Sent: Wednesday, June 15, 2022 3:57 PM To: MCLEOD-SKINNER Cass * BCE < Cass.MCLEOD-SKINNER@obce.oregon.gov > Subject: Spinal screening Cass, I had a question about spinal screening at a yoga studio (volunteer) and what consent/paperwork is needed. I just looked at our P&P and it states spinal screening is a non-diagnostic exam. Does this mean the DC does not need a progress note or informed consent and can just provide opinion and recommend further workup in the office? I know that's what was done in CA for marketing purposes.

There is one standard of care for all patients, irrespective of the condition, service, or advice provided. All chiropractic physicians licensed under ORS chapter 684 are subject to the following: (1) Clinical justification, within accepted standards and understood by a group of peers, must be shown for all opinions, diagnostic, and therapeutic procedures. The singular accepted standard of care includes obtaining a history that informs the examination, conducting an examination that informs the diagnosis, and using the diagnosis to inform the management plan which includes relevant outcome markers. (2) \"Accepted standards\" means skills and treatment which are recognized as being reasonable, prudent, and acceptable under similar conditions and circumstances. (3) For neuro-musculoskeletal conditions, all initial and subsequent examinations performed by a chiropractic physician to determine the need for treatment shall include a functional chiropractic analysis. Some combination of at least two of the following PARTS exam constitutes a functional chiropractic analysis: P \u2014 Location, quality, and intensity of pain or tenderness produced by palpation and pressure over specific structures and soft tissues; A \u2014 Asymmetry of sectional or segmental components identified by static palpation; R \u2014 The decrease or loss of specific movements (active, passive, and accessory); T \u2014 Tone, texture, and temperature change in specific soft tissues identified through palpation; S \u2014 Use of special tests or procedures. (4) Chiropractic physicians shall treat their patients as often as necessary to allow for favorable progress. Evidence-based outcomes management shall determine whether the frequency and duration of curative chiropractic treatment is, has been, or continues to be necessary. Outcomes management shall include both subjective, or patient-driven, information as well as objective, provider-driven, information. In addition, treatment of neuro-musculoskeletal conditions outside of the Oregon Practices and Utilization Guidelines may be considered contrary to accepted standards. Chiropractic physicians treating outside of the Practices and Utilization Guidelines bear the burden of proof to show that the treatment, or lack thereof, is clinically justified. (5) Copies of any independent examination report must be made available to the patient, the patient's attorney, the treating doctor, and the attending physician at the time the report is made available to the initial requesting party. Statutory/Other Authority: ORS 684 Statutes/Other Implemented: ORS 684.155 811-015-0066 Telehealth (1) As used in this section, \"telehealth\" means a variety of methods, through the use of electronic and telecommunications technologies, for the distance delivery of health care services, including chiropractic services, excluding in-person services, and clinical information designed to improve the health status of a patient, and to enhance delivery of the health care services and clinical information. (2) A chiropractic physician who is licensed by, and is in active status with, the Oregon Board of Chiropractic Examiners to practice chiropractic may use telehealth if: (a) The use of telehealth is an appropriate manner in which to provide a chiropractic service; (b) The chiropractic physician is providing a chiropractic service that is within the scope of practice of the chiropractic physician; and (3) The use of telehealth as described in subsection (2) of this section is not an expansion of the scope of practice of chiropractic physicians. The use of telehealth establishes a doctor-patient relationship. (4) The board shall treat a chiropractic service that is delivered by a chiropractic physician through telehealth as described in subsection (2) of this section the same as the board treats the chiropractic service when delivered in person. The board shall apply identical quality and practice standards to a particular chiropractic service regardless of the method of delivery of the chiropractic service. Statutory/Other Authority: ORS 684 Statutes/Other Implemented: ORS 684.155 811-015-0070 Scope of Practice Regarding Examinations, Tests, Substances, Devices and Procedures (1) The Board may examine any diagnostic and/or therapeutic examination, test, substance, device or procedure (ETSDP) to determine its acceptability for patient care. The Board may require a chiropractic physician to provide information on any ETSDP for de termination of its status, taking into account all relevant factors and practices, including, but not limited to: the practices generally and currently followed and accepted by persons licensed to practice chiropractic in the state, the teachings at chirop ractic schools accredited by the Council on Chiropractic Education or its successor, relevant technical reports published in recognized journals, and the desirability of reasonable experimentation in the furtherance of the chiropractic arts and sciences. (2) A chiropractic physician may use any diagnostic and/or therapeutic ETSDP which is considered standard. A standard diagnostic and/or therapeutic ETSDP is one in which one or more of the following criteria have been satisfied: (a) Is taught or has been ta ught by a chiropractic school accredited by the Council on Chiropractic Education or its successor, or health professions' courses taught by regionally accredited colleges with subject matter that is within the scope of chiropractic practice and has not be en disapproved by the Board; or (b) Has been approved by the Board through the petition process: (A) The petition requires a formalized agreement of 10% or more of the chiropractic physicians, holding an active chiropractic license in Oregon, attesting to the safety and efficacy of a particular ETSDP. The petition shall be submitted in writing to the Board by any party wishing to establish any ETSDP as standard. It is the responsibility of the petitioner to gather the required evidence and supporting statem ents. It is the sole responsibility and discretion of the Board to review the sufficiency of the evidence in the petition and to make a determination whether to concur and affirm the ETSDP as standard or to deny the petition. The Board may, but is not requ ired to, hold a public hearing on any petition. The Board shall make its determination and reply to the petitioner within 180 days of receipt of the petition unless the Board and the petitioner mutually agree to extend the deadline. (B) The petition shall specifically address the following issues: (i) The kind of ETSDP that is the subject of the petition, i.e., whether it is an examination, a test, a substance, a device, a procedure, or a combination thereof; (ii) A detailed description of the proposed ETSD P; (iii) The clinical justification for the ETSDP; (iv) A method for determining appropriate termination of care and/or consultation with other providers with special skills/knowledge for the welfare of the patient; (v) Whether the proposed ETSDP is to be used by itself or used in addition to any other generally accepted or standard ETSDP; (vi) A description of known or anticipated contraindications, risks, and benefits; (vii) A description of any subpopulations for which greater risk or benefit is expected ; (viii) A description of any standard ETSDP for the equivalent condition together with its relative risks and benefits; and (ix) An assessment of the expected consequences of withholding the proposed ETSDP. (c) Is supported by adequate evidence of clinica l efficacy as determined by the Board. In determining adequacy, the Board may consider whether the ETSDP: (A) Has clinical justification; (B) Has valid outcome assessment measures; (C) Is supported in peer reviewed literature; (D) Is consistent with gener ally recognized contraindications to chiropractic procedures; and (E) The potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the patient. (3) A chiropractic physician may use any diagnostic and/or therapeutic ETSDP that has not met the criteria of subsectio ns (2)(a) - (c) of this rule as investigational. It must show potential merit for effectiveness and be of acceptable risk. Documentation requirements are based on potential risk to the patient. All investigational diagnostic ETSDPs must include or be accom panied by standard diagnostic procedures until full Board approval is attained under the criteria cited in subsections (2)(a) - (c) of this rule. Nothing in this section is intended to interfere with the right of any patient to refuse standard or investigational ETSDPs. In determining risk, the Board may use the following criteria: (a) For minimal risk procedures, defined as those which, when properly or improperly performed on the general population, would have a slight chance of a slight injury and, when properly performed on select populations, have an extremely remote chance of serious injury: (A) Informed consent is suggested but not required; and (B) The chiropractic physician is recommended, but not required, to participate in or conduct a formal inve stigation of the procedure. (b) For low risk procedures, defined as those which, when properly performed on the general population have a slight chance of mild injury; when improperly performed on the general population have a mild chance of mild to moderate injury, and when properly performed on select populations have a remote chance of serious injury: (A) Informed consent is required; and (B) The chiropractic physician is recommended, but not required, to participate or conduct a formal investigation of the procedure. (c) For moderate risk procedures, defined as those which, when properly performed on the general public have a significant chance of mild injury and a slight chance of moderate injury; when improperly performed on the general population have a slight chance of severe injury; and when properly performed on select populations have a slight chance of serious i njury: (A) Written informed consent is required; and (B) The chiropractic physician is recommended, but not required, to participate or conduct a formal investigation of the procedure. (d) For high risk procedures, those which, when properly performed on t he general population have a significant chance of moderate injury and a slight chance of serious injury; when improperly performed on the general population have a significant chance of serious injury; and when properly performed on select populations hav e a significant chance of serious injury: (A) Written informed consent is required; and (B) The chiropractic physician is required to participate in or conduct a formal investigation of the procedure under the auspices of, or in conjunction with, any other health care professionals knowledgeable and competent in the care and treatment of potential serious injuries. (e) Board approval is required of all moderate or high risk procedures. (4) The Board shall maintain a list of ETSDPs which have been reviewed and have been determined to be unacceptable or approved as investigational. (5) A chiropractic physician may not use any diagnostic and/or therapeutic ETSDPs which have been determined by the Board to be unacceptable. Statutory/Other Authority: ORS 684 Statutes/Other Implemented: ORS 684.155 ___________________________________________ OBCE and Procedure Page 1 of 1 version date: 03/2020 Oregon Board of Chiropractic Examiners Effective Date: March 29, 2020 Date approved/ratified: March 29, 2020 Telehealth Policy and Procedure POLICY OAR 811 -015-0066, Telehealth Rule, allows Oregon licensed chiropractic physicians to utilize telehealth (electronic and telecommunication technologies) for the distance delivery of health care services and clinical information designed to improve the health status of a patient, and to enha nce delivery of the health care services and clinical information . The Board has determined that this rule applies to both existing and new patients.

The device was reviewed by the OBCE's ETSDP Committee and on January 17, 2013, this policy was adopted by the OBCE in accordance with the ETSDP rule. The BAX 3000 and similar devices are disapproved (outside the sco pe) as a diagnostic procedure. As a treatment modality, the BAX 3000 and similar devices are considered Investigational with Moderate Risk for use with chiropractic patients. This rating requires a written Informed Consent statement signed by the patient . This rating also recommends the chiropractic physician participate in or conduct a formal investigation of the procedure. The written informed consent must at a minimum address or include: The risks of ingesting food or substances which may provoke an anaphylaxis reaction. A statement that the use of this treatment could cause an exacerbation. An acknowledgement that there is currently a lack of peer reviewed evidence and other evidence such as case studies. If the patient is to be part of a research or case study, consents to that participation. An understanding that this treatment is considered 'Investigational with Moderate Risk\" by the Oregon Board of Chiropractic Examiners. This device/procedure is not used to diagnose allergies or other condition s and that other procedures are used for that purpose. Chiropractic physicians using the BAX 3000 or similar devices must adhere to the OBCE's advertising rules and policies. They must refrain from making advertising claims which cannot be supported. (3/ 21/13) BIOPTRON LIGHT THERAPY The Bioptron Light Therapy Unit is approved by the FDA and the Board as a standard device. (3/16/95) CPAP MACHINE, ORDERING The Board determined that ordering a CPAP machine and/or a sleep study is within the DC's scope of practice ; however, whether insurance will pay or not is another question. CTD MARK I MULTI -TORSION TRACTION DEVICE The CTD Mark I Multi -torsion Traction Device (used as part of the non -surgical treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome) is approved. (4/20/95) DYNATRON 2000 The Dynatron 2000 computerized muscle -testing device is a standard device for use by chiropractors in Oregon. The Board makes no assertion of its validity. The standard designation does not imply that use of the device is per se medically necessary. (5/15/97) ELLMAN SS PELLEVE This is a high frequency low temperature radio wave unit (or similar units), \"utilized to tighten collagen within the skin non-invasively .\" Although this is not a laser procedure, it may be similar to the laser treatments for cosmetic purposes. On March 18, 2010, the OBCE referred this issue to the ETSDP committee for review. Previ ously in September 2009, the OBCE determined a similar device, Lam Probe 4000, was not to be used. (3/18/10) ENERGY MEDICINE DEVICES The OBCE receives periodic inquiries regarding so -called \"energy\" medicine devices which purport to use: \"quantum mechanics\" or \"quantum biofeedback\" or \"nano -technology\" or claims in any way to have thousands of \"preprogrammed scenarios and library refere nces organized into defined groups, which create quick and manageable patient assessments.\" These are presumed to be outside the Oregon chiropractic scope of practice until such time the specific device is reviewed by the OBCE under the provisions of OAR 811-015-0070 (ETSDP rule) and determined to be either standard or investigational. This includes the \"Zyto\" device, Quantum QXCI Bio -Resonance Device, and any other devices which are similar in operation to the EPFX -SCIO device (which was previously eval uated and found to be unacceptable). (5/27/10) EPIPEN Chiropractors are allowed to administer an Epi-pen to a person who is suffering from anaphylactic shock and unable to i nject the Epi -pen by him/herself. In 2007 legislation which clar ified in ORS 684.025 that chiropractic physicians may provide emergency first aid. EPFX/SCIO DEVICE The OBCE determined the EPFX/SCIO device is unacceptable for use by chiropractic physicians in Oregon . They also voted to consider this device again if there is a new USA -FDA, or new USA - FDA -IRB (investigational review board) clearance. (UPDATE: Dec 2007 Seattle Times article, \" FDA Bans Import of Unproven Machine .\") The Board is concerned about this device's biofeedback features, which appear to be more passive than active. (active biofeedback being standard for chiropractic in Oregon). There is also real concern wi th the device's purported ability to recognize if not diagnose a huge number of conditions based on the body's response to micro current stimulation. Following review by the ETSDP Committee, t he OBCE spent numerous hours over the course of three meetings to review this device. This is the first time since the ETSDP rule was adopted in 1995 that an \"unacceptable\" determination has been the result of this review. For more information concerning this decision see the OBCE's public meeting minutes for Februa ry, March and May of 2007 on the Board's Web page. EPI TOUCH ALEX HAIR REMOVAL DEVICE EPI Touch Alex hair removal device is approved as a minimal risk investigational minor surgery procedure. (9/24/99) INFRATONIC QGM DEVIC E This device is approved as investigational for treating neuro -musculoskeletal conditions only. (5/12/17) MAGNETS A review of magnets revealed a lack of quality clinical evidence either supporting or opposing the use of magnets for pain relief. Magnets are not prohibited for use b y chiropractors. However, it would be inaccurate for anyone to represent that the Board has \"approved\" the use of magnets. (7/27/00) MD PEEL MICRO -ABRASION DEVICE The MD Peel Micro -abrasion device is approved as a minimal risk investigational minor surgery procedure. (9/24/99) MICROCURRENT DEVICES Chiropractors may prescribe micro -current devices to their patients. (9/19/94) MICROLIGHT 830 /COLD LASER THERAPY The use of the Microlight 830 is taught at some chiropractic college s, and is therefore considered \"standard\" in Oregon, and determined to be within the scope of c hiropractic. (7/17/03) (Also see \"Laser Light Therapy\" under Section I - Procedures.) PETROMETER The instrument called the Petrometer, used to measure range of motion, is considered standard instrumentation already in use. (12/15/94) TENS DEVICES Chiropractors may prescribe TENS devices to their patients. (9/19/94) TOFTNESS DEVICE The Toftness device, banned by the FDA, may not be used. (6/22/95) In January 1982, the United States District Court in Wisconsin issued a permanent nationwide injunction against the manufacturing, promoting, selling, leasing, distributing, shipping, delivering, or using in any way any Toftness Radiation Detector or any artic le or device that is substantially the same as, or employs the same basic principles as, the Toftness Radiation Detector. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit upheld this decision in 1984. The basis of the United States Government's case was that these devices were misbranded under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, because they could not be used safely or effectively for their intended purposes. Consequently, Oregon licensees should cease and desist using a Toftness or Toftness -like de vice. (1/17/91) TRACTION DEVICES The Board frequently receives questions from a variety of sources regarding traction, devices that accomplish traction, and billing. The American Chiropractic Association (ACA) notes that for the purpose of billing 970 12 mechanical traction is defined as: \"...the force used to create a degree of tension of soft tissues and/or to allow for separation between joint surfaces. The degree of traction is controlled through the amount of force (pounds) allowed, duration (time), and angle of pull (degrees) using mechanical means.\"1 There are a variety of devices on the market that potentially provide traction. Chiropractors should investigate the device, the intent of the manufacturer, and any FDA approvals for its use. If the device is capable of providing traction, the chiropractor should ensure that the device is properly used to affect the desired goal. The Board does not issue opinions or rulings regarding coding or billing questions. The Board encourages all Oregon Chiropractors to analyze whether the methods they employ meet the above ACA definition, and whether the specific device and that manner in which it is utilized provides traction. The Board always reminds doctors to ensure that their notes with regard to this and all treatments should be maintained in compliance with Oregon Administrative Rule 811 -015-0005(1)(C). (9/17/15) PROCEDURES ACUP UNCTURE The Board has determined that needle acupuncture is outside the Oregon chiropractic scope of practice. (ORS 684.035, Chapter not applicable to other methods of healing) ACUPUNCTURE USED AS ANESTHESIA FOR MANIPULATION (See Also Manipulation Under Anesthesia) MUA is specific to hospital setting. There are no specific statutes or rules concerning the use of acupuncture as the anesthetic. The Board suggests writing the Board of Medical Examiners to get their views on this subject. (4/16/92) ALLERGIES The scope of practice for a Doctor of Chiropractic allows for the treatment of allergies. APPLIED SPINAL BIOMECHANICAL ENGINEERING (ASBE) The Board determined that ASBE is investigational and must comply with the investigational rule and the rule on informed consent. Chiropractors using ASBE must register their use of this techniqu e with the Board of Chiropractic Examiners. Patients must be informed that the technique is considered investigational and consent must be in writing to its use in their case. AURICULOTHERAPY After review by the ETSDP Committee and a recommendation to the Board, the Board has determined that auriculotherapy, the device used and the therapy, is standard . The therapy is performed without needles; it is a form of electro acupuncture. The procedure has been taught in CCE colleges. (11/16/06) This topic was re visited by the board and it confirmed that this therapy is part of the scope of chiropractic practice. (12/17/12) AUTOMATED MUSCLE TESTING The Board determined that automated muscle testing is within the scope of practice and is 1 American Chiropractic Association, Coding Clarification 97012, Mechanical Traction/Spinalator accepted in the P & U Vol. I Guidelines. A chiropractor need s to show rationale for using automated muscle testing. (9/21/95) BIOFEEDBACK Chiropractors may order or perform biofeedback. (4/15/96) BLOOD PRESSURE (SUPINE AND STANDING) Supine and standing blood pressure are within the scope of chiropractic practice. (11/21/91) BLOOD WITHDRAWAL See VENIPUNCTURE BLOODBORNE PATHOGENS - STANDARDS, PROCEDURES Effective July 1992, Oregon Occupational Safety and Health Division (OR -OSHA) adopted the Federal standard on Bloodborne Pathogens. Oregon Chiropractors are required to implement the standards in their clinics. Oregon OSHA has adopted the Federal OSHA Final Standard on Bloodborne Pathogens. The purpose of the standard is to limit and control occupational exposure to blood and other potentially infectious materials. This law covers all employees who could reasonably be expected to come in contact with human blood or other potentially infectious materials in the course of their work. Therefore, if you employ people in your cl inic that may be subject to exposure to blood or other bodily fluids, this law may have a direct effect on you. IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO DETERMINE IF THIS LAW APPLIES TO YOU. The staff of the Oregon Board of Chiropractic Examiners does not have the exp ertise to advise you in matters related to this law. Call or write OR -OSHA (Salem Central Office, 350 Winter St. NE, Rm. 430, Salem, OR 97310 (503) 378 -3272 or 1 -800-922-2689 . Rule 437 -Division 2, Bloodborne Pathogens (1910.1 030) and/or Questions & Answers About Bloodborne Pathogens. BREAST THERMOGRAPHY The Oregon Board of Chiropractic Examiners has determined that breast thermography is investigational. Investigational means further study is warranted, evidence is equivoc al or insufficient, the patient has to evaluate their own risk and it is not standard. Standard means that it is taught in a chiropractic college or otherwise accepted in the chiropractic profession. Clinical breast thermography is an investigational pro cedure that may be performed by a doctor or technician who has been adequately trained and certified by a recognized organization. However, the interpretation of the thermal images will only be made by health care providers who are licensed to diagnose and hold credentials as board certified clinical thermographers or diplomates from a recognized organization. This is meant to insure that directed care and proper follow -up recommendations will be made available to the patient if warranted by the interpretat ion of the images. Any chiropractic clinic providing breast thermography imaging must use the informed consent form (Appendix C). This is in addition to verbal communication with the patient to ensure their understanding of these informed consent provisions, the investigational status and that this is adjunctive to other standard diagnostic imaging or examination. COLONICS OR COLONIC THERAPY The board restated it s previous policy in that they determine colonic therapy is hydrotherapy, and is allowed within the scope of chiropractic practice, but CCAs are not allowed to perform it due to the higher risk of the procedure . There are inherent risks, such as causing septic shock by rupturing the bowels. (9/ 28/07) (9/15/14) CONTACT REFLEX ANALYSIS Contact reflex analysis is within the scope of chiropractic practice. (4/21/94) CRA was reviewed in 2009 and its current position as standard was not changed. (05/21/09) CRANIOSACRAL MANIPULATION As part of Cr aniosacral Therapy, Craniosacral Manipulation is a standard chiropractic procedure. (1/21/93) CUPPING Cupping is a type of myofascial release; it is taught in accredited chiropractic colleges. The Board determined that cupping is allowed within the DC sco pe of practice. No determination was made on the types of cup used. ( 9/22/16) DARK FIELD MICROSCOPY Although the general use of dark field microscopy is allowed within the scope of chiropractic, Licensees may not use dark field microscopy for the purposes of conducting live cell analysis. (1/23/14) EKGS Chiropractors may order or (SSEP) Performing an SSEP electrodiagnostic test is within the scope of chiropractic practice. (1/18/96) ELECTROLYSIS This procedure was reconsidered by the Board. \" A person uses an electrical device that is not used for physical therapy. The tissue is destroyed so the hair does not grow back. It is a surgical intervention where you are changing the tissue t ype.\" The Board determined that electrolysis (i.e. removal of hair) is a minor surgical procedure and requires specialty certification by the Board to perform. (11/20/03) ELECTROTHERAPY Chiropractic Physicians may treat hemorrhoids with electrotherapy, sp ecifically, the application of negative low voltage galvanic current (known as the Keesey technique) to the hemorrhoid. ORS Chapter 684.010(2)(a) and (5). This therapy is approved and is considered as standard in the above -described manner and shall not b e considered investigational by the Board. The Board recognizes that undergraduate and postgraduate courses at Western States Chiropractic College, a Council on Chiropractic Education accredited school, have included the teaching of this therapy for more t han thirty years. (3/25/91) EMG AND SURFACE EMG TESTING Any trained individual, including certified chiropractic assistants, may apply electrodes and conduct surface EMG testing, but the doctor has to interpret the results. (11/16/95 , 7/18/96) EPLEY MAN EUVER The Oregon Board of Chiropractic Examiners confirms that the Epley Mane uver as a Canalith repositioning procedure for treatment of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is well within the Oregon chiropractic scope of practice. These procedures are taught in chiropractic colleges and address ed in the EENT (eye, ear, nose, and throat ) courses required in chiropractic colleges. Further coding for this procedure is addressed the American Chiropractic Association's Chiropractic Coding Solutions Manual. See http://www.acatod ay.org/content css.cfm?CID=3204 for more information on this subject. (05/22/12) FISSURECTOMY This procedure is within the scope of practice for chiropractic physicians in Oregon. (1/28/92) GALVANIC ELECTRICITY See ELECTROTHERAPY HEMORRHOIDS (TREATMENT OF) See ELECTROTHERAPY INJECTIONS Can a licensee refer a patient to an MD for an injection (e.g. to a facet joint for pain relief) without the MD having to evaluate the patient him or herself? The Board determined that a licensee may refer t o the MD for the examination, but it is up to the MD to determine whether he/she needs to perform an additional examination and how to proceed. (11/9/00) IMMEDIATE RELEASE TECHNIQUE (IRT ) / RAPID EYE TECHNIQUE Recently the ETSDP committee recommended, and the OBCE accepted that IRT (Immediate Release Technique) may be used by Chiropractors under the investigational rule (reference below). IRT involves eye exercises combined with forms of acupressure and chiropr actic adjusting. The eye exercises are shown to affect brain activity that can alter pain states. There is a growing amount of clinical correlation showing that the brain function changes can/may change endocrine function associated with stress states. Th e military is investigating use of similar treatment procedures with veterans suffering with PTSD (post -traumatic stress disorder). However, RET (Rapid Eye Technique), a technique that extends the treatment time and complexity to involve psychological counseling, is counseling/psychology and is NOT a chiropractic procedure . The OBCE will allow RET courses as continuing education similar to other adjunct treatment education, such as OHSU programs on surgical procedures. (May 2008) KEESEY TECHNIQUE See ELECTROTHERAPY KINESIOTAPING METHOD May a certified C hiropractic Assistant perform \" kinesiot aping\" ? The kinesiot aping Method involves taping over and around muscles in order to assist and give support to, or prevent, over - contraction. The Board determined if the supervising DC is trained in the taping method, that he or she may also train the certified CA also to perform the method in the clinic, and only while the DC is on pre mise. The Board considers this a physiotherapy . (3/15/07) LASER LIGHT THERAPY A variety of low -level laser and light therapy (LLLT a.k.a . phototherapy) is available to Oregon chiropractic physicians as a standard treatment for NMS conditions. University of Western States (UWS) and other chiropractic colleges have current core curriculum on this subject. In addition, UWS is continuing work on future curriculum to cover advances and new applications in technology of this field. LLLT has been used to speed wound healing, stimulate tissue repair, reduce swelling and edema, and reduce acute and chronic pain. LLLT has been popular in Europe and Asia. More recently, in 2002, the United States FDA granted 510 (k) clearances allowing for healing and pain relief w ith various soft tissue disorders including carpal tunnel, rheumatoid arthritis, bursitis, tendonitis and more. The OBCE approves and affirms, as standard use, Class I through IV lasers/phototherapy for use by chiropractors as well as certified chiropractic assistants who have been properly trained for their use . The OBCE also approved use of Class IIIb & IV \"hot\" lasers for use by chiropractic physicians to treat NMS conditions . Expect requirements for DCs to obtain certification limited to treatment of benign superficial lesions, lacerations/abrasions, and removal of superficial foreign bodies. Chiropractors and chiropractic assistants must be properly trained for use of all LLLT. Training is usually available from the vendors of these dev ices. Class IIIb for NMS conditions does not require detailed special training other than provided by vendors, however use of Class IV devices requires strict adherence to safety pro tocols. Minor surgery training should be more extensive. Phototherapy in volves the application of specific wavelengths of light energy capable of penetrating into tissue and being absorbed by cells. Light energy can be produced by low level laser and/or super luminous diodes (SLDs). Sufficient energy must be delivered to targe t tissue to trigger a response. Light is absorbed by irradiated tissue where the light energy is transformed into biochemical energy, which is then available for photochemical cell activities. The FDA has classified lasers into six categories based on t heir potential damage to the eye. They are: Class 1: Safe to human eye or contained within device, no labeling required. Class 2: Low power lasers with output less than 1 mW. Labeled, \"CAUTION - Laser Radiation: Do not stare into beam\" Class 2a: Eye da mage can occur if laser enters eye more than 1,000 seconds. Labeled: \"CAUTON - Laser Radiation: Do not stare into beam\" Class 3a: Power output up to 5 mW. Direct eye contact for short periods is not hazardous, but viewing laser through magnifying optics suc h as eyeglasses can present a hazard. Labeled: \"CAUTON - Laser Radiation: Do not stare into beam or view directly with optical instruments.\" Class 3b: Involves certain risk. Laser output 5mW to 500 mW. Labeled \"DANGER - Visible and/or invisible laser radiat ion - avoid direct exposure to beam.\" Class 4: High power lasers with output greater than 500 mW. Involves definite risk. Labeled \"DANGER - Visible and/or invisible laser radiation - avoid eye or skin exposure to direct or scattered beam.\" According to UWS instructor Joel Agresta PT, DC, a patient treated with Class IV must wear goggles. \"Class IV lasers have great benefits if handled properly and can deliver more energy in less time, but proper training and understanding of the contraindications is impera tive. As far as I understand, the manufacturers (i.e., K -Lasers and Avicenna) issue specific protocols that keep these lasers safe for NMS conditions. These protocols have some degree of safety built into them. By their nature they do require a higher lev el of safety precaution, but when following the programmed protocols it appears that they are safe.\" He also said by law, Class III and above must be stored in a locked cabinet. Dr. Agresta says that \"photo -biostimulation\" stimulates or speeds up the inf lammatory process and resultant healing when lower doses are used. However, he says that at higher doses starting around 100 to 200 Joules/cm2 (Joules/cm2 = power/beam area x time) inhibitory or negative effects may occur. The ETSDP Committee and the OBC E reviewed a wealth of published clinical literature which documents many therapeutic applications of LLLT The Board has received legal advice that LLLT for purely cosmetic conditions , such as hair removal, which do not address a skin condition or pathology , is not within the current scope of chiropractic practice. To the board's knowledge, this is not currently taught in any chiropractic college course. ( If this change s, the OBCE can revisit this issue.) In 2012 t he Board asked whether it is \"...within the scope of practice for a Doctor of Chiropractic in the state of Oregon to treat toenail fungus with laser therapy? \" The Board confirmed this would be allowed, \" as this is for treatment of a condition. Previous legal advice has advised the OBCE th at use of lasers by chiropractic physicians for strictly cosmetic purposes is not within the chiropractic scope of practice, an example of this would be hair removal. \" (12/20/06; 9/28/07; 9/21/17) LINGUAL ASCORBIC ACID TEST Lingual ascorbic acid test is within the scope of chiropractic practice. (11/21/91) MANIPULATION OF THE CERVICAL SPINE Classic, diversified, and Gonstead -type manipulation of the cervical spine are standard procedures. Chiropractors may contact National Chiropractic Mutual Insurance C ompany for information on the risk factors of these procedures. (5/16/96) MANIPULATION UNDER ANESTHESIA Manipulation under Anesthesia is within the scope of practice for Chiropractic Physicians in Oregon. (1/28/92) In review of this procedure, the Board found that Texas Chiropractic College teaches a continuing education course in Manipulation Under Anesthesia and offers a preceptorship program. The Board expects that hospitals involved with MUA will require proper training of Doctors of Chiropractic before allowing them to perform this procedure. N.A.E.T. NAMBUDRIPAD ALLERGY ELIMINATION TECHNIQUE After reviewing the details of this techn ique, the Board determined that, as described, it is allowable within the scope of chiropractic practice in Oregon, excepting the application of needle acupuncture. (12/19/00) NASAL SPECIFICS Chiropractors may not use local anesthesia for performing nasal specifics. (5/16/96) NCV - NERVE CONDUCTION VELOCITY (performed by a technician) Chiropractors in Oregon may order or perform nerve conduction velocity testing. Recently the Board was asked if there is any licensure requirements for a technician who p erforms this test on behalf of the chiropractor and/or testing service. They determined that no special certification is required by chiropractors or any other trained person to perform NCV testing in Oregon (technical component only). That said, the Bo ard does have serious concerns due to persistent reports of testing services that charge excessive fees. The Board also has concerns with reports it has received regarding the billing practices associated with NCV and other kinds of diagnostic testing. T he Board advises that these tests should meet basic criteria of medical necessity. (04/01) OUTPATIENT AND RADIOLOGICAL TESTS Chiropractors may order outpatient laboratory and radiological tests from hospitals. A chiropractor may order any test a hospita l has available. (5/16/96) PARASPINAL SURFACE EMG Paraspinal surface EMG is within the scope of practice. (8/20/92) POSTURAL SCREENING See SPINAL (POSTURAL) SCREENING PULMONARY STUDIES Ordering pulmonary studies is within the scope of chiropractic practice. (9/21/95) QUANTITATIVE FUNCTIONAL CAPACITY EVALUATIONS (QFCE). QFCEs are not within the chiropractic assistant scope of practice. The QFCE requires the doctor's clinical judgment for evaluation and performance. CAs do not have th e required training for this. The board also determined that QFCEs may not be performed by a Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist (CSCS) under the OBCE's \"Any Trained Person\" policy, thus a CSCS may not perform this as part of the chiropractic c linic's services in or out of the clinic. The QFCE has to be performed by the chiropractic physician (or other licensed health provider within their scope of practice). (3/21/13) RANGE OF MOTION REPORTING When reporting range of motion (ROM) measurements , the method of measurement should be noted, e.g. visual, goniometer, or inclinometer (single or double). The preferred method of measurement is with the goniometer in the extremities and the double inclinometer in the spine. Effort should be made to obt ain reproducible measurements. (1/16/97) RAPID EYE TECHNIQUE (RET) See Immediate Release Technique in this section above (May 2008) RAST TESTING RAST Testing is within the scope of practice. (6/18/92) REIKI (Also see Reiki under Chiropractic Assistants) A Doctor of Chiropractic asked if his certified C hiropractic Assistant may practice Reiki , a form of massage therapy, in his office without his supervision . The Board determined that the certified CA may perform this type of massage ONLY if the supervising DC is also Reik i trained , and on premise to supervise. If the certified CA , trained in Reiki, is also an Oregon licensed massage therapist, then that is already allowed with the LMT scope of practice . (3/15/07) SOLKOWICH CALCIUM ABSORPTION AND UTILIZATION Solkowich calcium absorption and utilization are within the scope of chiropractic practice. (11/21/91) SOMATIC TECHNIQUE The Board approved the somatic technique as a standard technique. Somatic technique is a neuromuscular ree ducation or active muscle relaxation technique. It is taught at Palmer College West. (10/17/96) SPINAL (POSTURAL) SCREENING Any properly trained person may do postural screening under the onsite supervision of a chiropractic physician, but only a chiropractic physician may interpret the information. A postural screening is a non -diagnostic exam, which does not include any treat ment. (9/18/97) SPUTUM ALCOHOL TESTING Chiropractors may perform sputum alcohol testing. (5/15/97) STRESS TESTS Stress tests (e.g. Koningsberg) are within the scope of chiropractic practice. (11/21/91) TMJ (TEMPOROMANDIBULAR JOINT ) Chiropractors may tr TRIGGER POINT INJECTIONS (MYOFASCIAL) Are Oregon licensees who have completed the postgraduate certification in minor surgery able to perform myofascial trigger point injections? The Board determined that injection of myofascial trigg er points is a therapy, and as such is not within the Oregon chiropractic scope of practice. In addition , the injection is more than \"superficial\" and thus is not covered by the minor surgery provisions. (12/11/02 ) ULTRASOUND , DIAGNOSTIC Appropriately t rained Doctors of Chiropractic may provide musculoskeletal diagnostic ultrasound. (9/17/15) ULTRASOUND , THERAPEUTIC Therapeutic ultrasound is within the scope of chiropractic practice. (8/19/93) URINALYSIS Urinalysis is allowed within the scope of chiropractic practice. (11/21/91) VENIPUNCTURE Chiropractors are allowed to draw blood (venipuncture) for diagnostic testing purposes. This diagnostic testing procedure is taught in approved chiropractic colleges all over the United States. (10/24/96) ORS 684.010(2)(b) defines \"Chiropractic\" as \"The chiropractic diagnosis, treatment and prevention of body dysfunction; correction, maintenance of the structural and functional integrity of the neuromusculoskeletal system and the effects thereof or interf erences therewith by the utilization of all recognized and accepted chiropractic diagnostic procedures and the employment of all rational therapeutic measures as taught in approved chiropractic colleges.\" ORS 684.025(2) states: \"Nothing in this section or ORS 684.010 shall be interpreted as authorizing the administration of any substance by the penetration of the skin or mucous membrane of the human body for a therapeutic purpose.\" Further legal advice from the Oregon Attorney General confirms that \"Chiro practic physicians are accordingly authorized by law to withdraw blood or other fluid samples for diagnostic purposes in connection with the practice of chiropractic.\" (9/9/70) SUBSTANCES ALOE VERA GEL (FOR ORAL CONSUMPTION AND/OR TOPICAL USE) Chiroprac tors may recommend aloe vera gel. (1/21/93) AQUA -SOOTHE This product is within the scope of practice, but the Board does have concerns about proper billing. (1/21/93) BOTANICALS Non-prescription botanicals are within the scope of chiropractic practice. (5/18/95) CLINICAL NUTRITION Applied clinical nutrition is within the scope of practice. See ORS 684.010. (4/21/94; 9/18/97) COLLOIDAL SILVER ; SILVER Previous OBCE policy stated, \"Licensed chiropractors may create their own colloidal silver and sell it to their patients... (3/19/98) \" As of January 17, 2013, this is revised due to concerns that the oral ingestion of silver runs the risk of causing argyria, a serious skin condition, and other less common health problems. New Policy: Chiropract ic physicians may not create their own colloidal silver for ingestion purposes and/or retail this to their patients from this point forward. (i.e. outside scope as per the ETSDP rule). Chiropractic physicians creating their own solutions may only use thes e for topical use. Both the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine and the Food and Drug Administration have issued strong warnings and alerts that focus on oral ingestion of silver compounds. Topical uses of silver as taught and ut ilized in chiropractic colleges is within the Oregon chiropractic scope of practice. Even given the potential for absorption of silver across the mucous membranes, the occasional use of intranasal Argyrol applications for sinusitis would not result in a do se that remotely approximates the chronic oral Reference Dose (RfD - 5 mg/kg of body weight/day) of silver established by the EPA as a risk for developing argyria. Also allowed is multi -mineral formulations which include small doses of colloidal silve r below the allowable EPA limits. (01/17/13) ETHYL CHLORIDE This product may not be used or by chiropractors in Oregon. (7/16/92) FLUORI -METHANE Fluori -methane is not in the Physician 's Desk Reference (PDR); however, according to the Oregon Bo ard of Pharmacy it is a prescription legend drug. This product may be used as a topical anesthetic in minor surgery ONLY, within the chiropractic profession in Oregon. (7/16/92) FORMULA 303 Chiropractors may recommend Formula 303 to patients, because it i s an herbal. (8/20/92) HCG POLICY Use of HCG (Human chorionic gonadotropin) - \"homeopathic\" or otherwise - is outside the Oregon chiropractic scope of practice. The U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have taken action to remove \"homeopathic\" HCG weight loss products from the market. Their advisory issued December 11, 2011 states, \"The labeling for the \"homeopathic\" HCG products states that each product should be taken in conjunction with a very low calorie diet. There is no substantial evidence HCG increases weight loss beyond that resulting from the recommended caloric restriction. Consumers on a very low calorie diet are at increased risk for side effects including gallstone formation, electrolyte imbalance, and heart arrhythmias. \"These HCG products marketed over -the-counter are unproven to help with weight loss and are potentially dangerous even if taken as directed,\" said Ilisa Bernstein, acting director of the Office of Compliance in FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. \"And a very low calorie diet should only be used under proper medical supervision.\" 03/27/12 HOMEOPATHICS , OVER -THE -COUNTER The Board addressed series of questions r egarding Over -the-Counter (OTC) homeopathic products (prepackaged for use by the consumer) . Question : May the DC g ive the patient a dose from that vial? Answer : Yes. Question : Send the patient home with a dose from that vial? Answer : Yes. Question : Place a pellet of the over -the-counter remedy in a vial with water to be administered to an infant? Answer : Yes. Question: - Or, must I sell them the entire vial of the remedy? Answer : No. INTRADERMALS Intradermals for allergy testing are within the scope of practice. (5/19/94) 04/11/1996 INJECTIONS This may be used in minor surgery only. MATOL AND FIBER SONIC (FIBER SUPPLEMENT) This supplement is OK to recommend. (1/21/93) MYOCIDE The use of myocide is within the scope of chiropractic practice (OTC). NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS Question : May a chiropractic clinic obtain nutritional supplements from a multilevel marketing company? Answer : DCs may obtain their nutritional supplements from any retail or wholesale source. However, engaging in multi -level marketing to patients is a different matter. If a chiropractic physician were to recruit patients to sell product and thus earn a commission, that could be in violation of the Board's rule on fee -splitting (OAR 811 -0035 -1015 (24). If the DC merely obtains and retails the product to patients, that is not multi -level marketing or fee -splitting. ORIENTAL HERBS The use of herbs is allowed within the scope of practice in Oregon. (5/19/94 ) OVER -THE -COUNTER NON -PRESCRIPTION the same thing as \"nonprescription drugs.\" The Board has adopted the Board of Pharm acy's definition of nonprescription (over -the-counter) drugs which is: ORS 689.005(22) \"Nonprescription drugs\" means drugs which may be sold without a prescription and which are prepackaged for use by the consumer and labeled in accordance with requireme nts of the statutes and regulations of this state and the Federal Government. (9/18/97) OVER -THE -COUNTER SUBSTANCES, DOSAGES In response to a question regarding whether the statutes or rules allow chiropractors to prescribe or recommend over -the-counter s ubstances in higher doses to achieve a more therapeutic or beneficial dosage, the Board's response is: Chiropractors must follow the statute. The statute is based on substances, not dosages. Chiropractors must use their best clinical judgment. (1/18/96; 7/ 9/98) \"dose -related ques tions were posed to the Board: 1) May a licensee g ive the patient a dose from an OTC/homeopathic preparation ? Yes. 2) Send the patient home with a dose from that vial? Yes. 3) Place a pellet of the over -the-counter r emedy in a vial with water to be administered to an infant? Yes 4) Or must I sell them the entire vial of the remedy? No. (10/5/10) OXYGEN (NOT allowed for therapeutic purposes ) Medical oxygen is outside the chiropractic scope of practice, and chiropractic physicians may not prescribe oxygen for therapeutic purposes . (4/27/00) (3/16/06 ) Concentration , oxygen The Oregon Board of Pharmacy considers USP (medical) Oxygen (100%) a pre scription drug. However oxygen concentrated at a lower percentage (90 to 95%) does not require a prescription. With that understanding, the OBCE does not prohibit oxygen concentration or the devices which produce this by chiropractic physicians. However , it would be inaccurate for anyone to represent that the Board has \"approved\" the use of oxygen concentration. Similar precautions as indicated for emergency medical oxygen must be observed. (11/20/2008) USE IN Emergencies , oxygen Chiropractic physicia ns and Certified Chiropractic Assistants may provide emergency first aid, including administering emergency oxygen. A person may not administer emergency oxygen unless the person has received training in the administration of oxygen . The OBCE is beginning the rulemaking process to establish training requirements . (HB 2242, 2007) Chiropractic physicians may obtain oxygen units on an over -the-counter non -prescription basis provided a few basic requirements are met. Use of portable oxygen units for clinic em ergencies is currently taught at Western States Chiropractic College. Access to emergency oxygen could be useful in the event of a cardiac arrest or other incident in which a patient may stop or have difficulty breathing. These OTC oxygen units are readily available over the Web from a variety of distributors. According to the FDA, any oxygen inhaled by a human or animal is considered a drug as per section 201(g)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), and is required to be dispensed by prescription. However , the agency allows medical oxygen to be dispensed without a prescription to properly trained individuals for oxygen deficiency and resuscitation, as long as the following conditions are met: 1) A high -pressure cylinder filled with medi cal oxygen and used for oxygen deficiency and resuscitation must have the following statement present on the drug label: \"For emergency use only when administered by properly trained personnel for oxygen deficiency and resuscitation. For all other medical applications, Rx Only.\" 2) The equipment intended for such use must deliver a minimum flow rate of 6 liters of oxygen per minute for a minimum of 15 minutes, and include a content gauge and an appropriate mask or administration device, and 3) Proper training i s documentation that an individual has received training within the past twenty -four months or other appropriate interval, in the use of emergency oxygen including providing oxygen to both breathing and non -breathing patients, and safe use and handing of emergency oxygen equipment. Training may be obtained from any nationally recognized professional organization, such as the National Safety Council, the American Heart Association, the American Red Cross, etc. Under no circumstances can emergency oxygen be used to fill high -pressure cylinders or be used in a mixture or blend. Once all of these conditions are met, an individual may have access to medical oxygen without a prescription . (11/16/06) Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy Question : (from an insurance claims rep.) Are chiropractors allowed to bill/perform CPT 99183 in the state of Oregon (physician attendance of hyperbaric oxygen therapy)? In other words, is hyperbaric oxygen therapy within the Oregon chiropractic scope of practice? Answer : Yes, as long as this utilizes concentrated oxygen, which is what we understand hyperbaric oxygen therapy to be. The Oregon Board of Pharmacy considers USP (medical) Oxygen (100%) a prescription drug. However oxygen concentrated at a lower percen tage (90 to 95%) does not require a prescription. With that understanding, the OBCE does not prohibit oxygen concentration or the devices which produce this by chiropractic physicians. However, it would be inaccurate for anyone to represent that the Board has \"approved\" the use of oxygen concentration. Similar precautions as indicated for emergency medical oxygen must be observed. (11/20/2008) PRESCRIPTIONS, RECOMMENDATION TO STOP USE Question : May a chiropractor tell a patient with diffuse muscular pain to stop taking Lipitor? Answer : It could be interpreted to be out of scope to do that bluntly as it could be considered the practice of medicine. It would be appropriate to share information and concerns with the patient (which the DC did). And/or the DC should share his concerns with the prescribing doctor since they are co -treating this patient. ORS 684.015 specifically proscribes DCs from administering or writing prescriptions for medications. ORS 684.035 (This) Chapter not applicable to other methods of healing, says, \"Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to interfere with any other method or science of healing in this state.\" SALICYLATES AND LIDOCAINE See LIDOCAINE AND SALICYLATES VITACEL Vitacel is not considered a nutritional supplement be cause the main carrier is a drug. (9/16/93) VITAMIN C WITH ECHINACEA This supplement is acceptable for chiropractors to recommend. (1/21/93) VITAMINS WITH BOTANICALS These supplements are acceptable for chiropractors to recommend. (1/21/93) SECTION II Practice Policies Regarding Chiropractors, Applicants, and Certified Chiropractic Assistants CHIROPRACTORS ABANDONMENT The Board determined that a licensee is not abandoning a patient in the case when the patient's insurance coverage reaches i ts limit, and the patient does not have private insurance nor can the patient afford to pay for further services. \"....this is not abandonment (since) t he patient is being given choices per the doctor's office policy. The decision is the patient's to conti nue care in that office or elsewhere with a policy that might better fit their need.\" (05/15/02) ADVERTISING REVIEW POLICY: (UPDATED APRIL 27, 2010) The OBCE does not review or pre -approve advertising by chiropractic physicians. Instead the Board is issui ng this advisory: Chiropractic physicians or any other person under the jurisdiction of the OBCE must be able to support statements, whatever the statements are, with credible evidence. This is necessary to be in compliance with: OAR 811 -015-0045 (1) (a): \"A Chiropractic physician shall not use or participate in the use of improper advertising which: States any fact which would result in the communication being untruthful, misleading or deceptive. (b) Contains statistical or other assertions of predicted rates of success of treatment...\" (also provisions 2 through 4) ORS 684.100 Grounds for discipline. Section (1)(i): \"The use of any advertising making untruthful, improper, misleading or deceptive statements. (j) The advertising of techniques or modalities to infer or imply superiority of treatment or diagnosis by the use thereof that cannot be conclusively proven to the satisfaction of the board. The OBCE may not impinge upon legiti mate commercial free speech rights. However, advertising statements must be supported by credible evidence . The OBCE recommends that this evidence be available for review upon request. Doctors should review their own advertising in light of OAR 811 -015-0045 and this policy. The Board will make a final determination of the credibility of evidence supporting advertising statements on a case by case basis when presented with a complaint concerning advertising. To assist in understanding what the OBCE consi ders to be violations of the advertising rule, final orders or excerpts regarding advertising violations will be provided upon request. (9/22/98) The Oregon Board of Chiropractic Examiners adopted five additional policy statements regarding advertising b y chiropractic physicians at their May 17, 2007 meeting. These policies are an update to the existing OBCE policy advisory on advertising issues. 1) Any advertising claims that spinal decompression/traction devices or any other medical device are a \"medica l breakthrough\" must be supported by credible evidence. 2) Claims of superiority for medical devices such as \"Non -surgical spinal decompression is the most promising disc pain treatment today\" must meet the standard articulated in ORS 684.100 Section (1) (k) : \"The advertising of techniques or modalities to infer or imply superiority of treatment or diagnosis by the use thereof that cannot be conclusively proven to the satisfaction of the board. 3) Statements contrasting spinal decompression favorably with dru gs or surgery without mentioning other kinds of chiropractic treatment are misleading to the public. 4) Use of the term \"FDA approved\" in reference to the FDA 510 (k) clearance process is misbranding and misleading advertising. The FDA's regulations make cl ear that \"Submission of a premarket notification in accordance with this subpart, and a subsequent determination by the Commissioner that the device intended for introduction into commercial distribution is substantially equivalent to a device in commerci al distribution before May 28, 1976, or is substantially equivalent to a device introduced into commercial distribution after May 28, 1976, that has subsequently been reclassified into class I or II, does not in any way denote official approval of the devi ce. Any representation that creates an impression of official approval of a device because of complying with the premarket notification regulations is misleading and constitutes misbranding.\" 5) When a statement is literally false, the (OBCE) presumes that it will cause injury to a competitor. (Cf. Energy Four, Inc. v. Dornier Medical Sys., Inc., 765 F. Supp. 724, 734 (N.D. Ga. 1991)) 6) (New question) The question was asked, \"May a chiropractor place their names in the medical and osteopathic doctor section in the Yellow Pages (in addition to the chiropractic section)? The salesman said that's one way to obtain additional advertising.\" The Board's answer is, \"That is likely misleading advertisin g in violation of the OBCE advertising rule, OAR 811 -015-0005.\" Advertising OAR 811 -015-0045 (1) A Chiropractic physician shall not use or participate in the use of improper advertising. Improper advertising is any advertising which: (a) States any fac t which would result in the communication being untruthful, misleading or deceptive; (b) Contains statistical or other assertions of predicted rates of success of treatment; or (c) Claims a specialty, degree or diplomate not possessed or that does not exist; (2) A chiropractor shall not practice under a name that is misleading as to the identity of the chiropractor or chiropractors practicing under such name or under a firm nam e which is misleading. (3) A Chiropractic physician shall adhere to the Doctors' Title Act, ORS 676.110(2). (4) A Chiropractic physician may use a professional card and/or letterhead identifying the Chiropractic physician's name, profession, address, t elephone number, name of the chiropractic office and educational degrees. It may also include names of licensed associates. ORS 684.100 Grounds for discipline of licensee or refusal to license; restoration; suspension; competency examinations; confidentia l information. (1) The State Board of Chiropractic Examiners may refuse to grant a license to any applicant or may discipline a person upon any of the following grounds: (a) Fraud or misrepresentation. (b) The practice of chiropractic under a false or assumed name. (c) The impersonation of another practitioner of like or different name. (i) The use of any advertising making untruthful, improper, misleading or deceptive statements. (j) The advertising of techniques or modalities to infer or imply sup eriority of treatment or diagnosis by the use thereof that cannot be conclusively proven to the satisfaction of the board. (L) Advertising either in the name of the person or under the name of another person, clinic, or concern, actual or pretended, in an y newspaper, pamphlet, circular or other written or printed paper or document, professing superiority to or a greater skill than that possessed by other chiropractic physicians that cannot be conclusively proven to the satisfaction of the board. (o) The a dvertising or holding oneself out to treat diseases or other abnormal conditions of the human body by any secret formula, method, treatment or procedure. (04/27/10) ANCILLARY SERVICES A clarification of OAR 811 -010-0130 Other Health Professionals . If the licensed \"ancillary\" person is offsite (i.e. Radiologist, LMT, PT, etc.) , may the chiropractor contract with them to provide services to the patients out side of the chiropractic clinic ? The Board determined if an established relationship with the provider as either an independent contractor or employee exists , you may refer the patient out. (11/16/06) ANIMALS, TREATMENT OF Chiropractic physicians are permitted to treat animals provided they have a written referral from a licensed veterinarian. The care rendered as a result of the referral must be in writing and in accordance with the standards of practice outlined in ORS 686 ; and only as prescribed and diagnosed by the veterinarian. (10/4/97) ATHLETIC TRAINERS, SUPERVISION Chiropractors may supervise athletic trainers. (11/16/95) BIRTH CERTIFICATES ORS 432.206 (3) states that the attending physicians shall prepare and file the birth certificate within five days of the birth. ORS 432.005 defines \"physician\" as including DCs so the signing of birth certificates is within a chiropractic physician's scope of practice. CHIROPRACTORS AND OTHER HEALTH LICENSES The Board consid ered a series of questions concerning Chiropractors hiring and/or working with other health professional licensees. The specific example dealt with the relationship between Chiropractors and Licensed Massage Technicians. As long as the licensee is working within the scope of the licensee's practice and is regulated by the licensee's own licensing Board, the licensee does not need to have a chiropractor present when working on the chiropractor's patient. The licensee is responsible for implementing and utilizing clinical judgment within the licensee's own scope of practice. The Board of Nursing has specific administrative rules allowing Licensed Practical Nurses and Registered Nurses \"to accept and implement orders for client care from licensed health care professionals who are authorized to independently diagnose and treat.\" Nurses are charged with the authority and responsibility to question any order which is not clear, perceived as unsafe, contraindicated for the client, or not within the health care pro fessional's scope of practice. Nurses must have knowledge of the professional's scope of practice. Please review OAR Chapter 851 Division 45 for more specific information regarding nursing scope of practice. If the person is acting in the capacity of a Chiropractic Assistant or Ancillary Personnel, OAR 811-010-0110 will apply, and the chiropractor must be present when required. The OBCE recommends that you thoroughly review the scope of practice for all personnel with whom you are working and/or choose to hire. (3/20/97) CLINIC OWNERSHIP RESPONSIBILITY RULE, POLICY AND INTENT STATEMENT: The purpose of OAR 811 -035-0015 (25) is to hold chiropractic clinic owners broadly responsible for the overall conduct of their clinic or clinics. This responsibility i s already inherent in ORS 684.100 1) f) A) & B), but more explicitly defined with this rule and policy. For example if the licensee owner's clinics have engaged in a consistent pattern of excessive treatment, that licensee would be in violation of this and other rules. Clinics that have only 'on the job' training, no written policies or procedures, and no process for ensuring patient safety and continuity of care when multiple doctors treat the same patient would be indicators of inadequate supervision. To the extent the licensee owner has fulfilled his/her fiduciary responsibilities for supervising and training a multi clinic practice or an individual clinic, that is an affirmative defense in the event an individual employee commits a violation of law or ru le. This rule does not apply to chiropractic colleges as they are not described in OAR 811 -010-0120. The Board can address specific questions as they come up: (such as) Question : Owner doctor advises and orders the employee doctor to follow the OBCE rules and guides per OAR 811 -010-0120, and the employee doctor fails due to \"poor judgment\" or other \"human errors\", what criteria does the owner doctor need to follow in order to pro ve that appropriate training has been implemented, and the owner doctor's burden has been met in order to comply with ORS: 811 -010-0125? Answer : Specific actions such as memos, emails, personnel file entries, continuing education, other training, clinic policies communicated; remedial actions, would all be indications that the owner doctor is providing adequate supervision. Whether the owner doctor has met the requirements of the rule would be a situation specific determination. Question : Are owner doct ors not held responsible for independent contractors working in their office but not operating under the owner's license? Answer : Yes, but only to the extent that they are \"...part of their chiropractic practice for the purpose of providing care to patients...\" as per OAR 811 -010- 0130 Other Licensed Health Care Providers New Section (25) to OAR 811 -035-0015 Unprofessional Conduct Chiropractic physicians holding an ownership interest as described in OAR 811 -010-0120 may be held responsible, entirely or in part, for supervised staff (listed below) who provide patient services. This includes a responsibility to render adequate supervision, management and training of ancillary staff or other persons including, but not limited to, chiropractic physicians, s tudent interns, chiropractic assistants and/or others practicing under the licensee's supervision. Chiropractors with supervised staff may be held responsible, entirely or in part, for undue influence on staff or a restriction of a supervised chiropractic physician from using their own clinical judgment. (01/23/14) CLINICAL JUSTIFICATION RULE POLICY The following policy declarations further describe and explain the intent of OAR 811-015- 0010 (4). The requirement in OAR 811-015-0010 (4) for e vidence based outcomes management for \"curative chiropractic treatment\" does not include maintenance or wellness care. OCPUG defines maintenance care as inclusive of both preventive care and supportive care. While preventive may be considered similar to wellness care, supportive care \"is appropriate for a patient who has reached maximum therapeutic benefit\" and/or \"is appropriate in patients who display persistent and/or recurrent signs of illness or impairment.\" Nothing in OAR 811-015-0010 should be interpreted as requiring or implementing a \"very restrictive cook book approach.\" The term \"evidence -based\" as it relates to outcomes measures is not a specific reference to the Educational Manual (EMEBC) or to \"evidence -based medicine,\" nor \"evidence -based best practice.\" There should be clinical literature and evidence supporting the outcome assessments utilized. \"Evidence\" means the whole body of professional knowledge. This includes the spectrum of evidence from random ized, c ontrolled clinical trials to less rigorous forms of evidence. Examples of less rigorous forms of evidence include s one or more well designed controlled observational clinical studies, clinically relevant basic science studies, descriptive studies, case reports, or expert opinion s published in refereed journals. Where such evidence is lacking professional field consensus is considered. Lastly, the Board understands that some practitioners employ investigational or other varied (or non-traditional) chiropractic approaches address ing certain types of curative chiropractic care. It is not the Board's intent to discourage these approaches with the evidence based outcomes measures language of Section (4). Should an issue or complaint arise concerning treatment of this general type, the Board will first look to Section (1) language which states, \" Clinical rationale, within accepted standards and understood by a group of peers, must be shown for all opinions, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.\" (5/18/06) COLONIC THERAPY (See also \"Colonic Therapy; colonics\" under Chiropractic Assistants The board restated its previous policy in that they determined colonic therapy is hydrotherapy, and is allowed within the scope of chiropractic practice, but CCAs are not allowed to perform it due to the higher risk of the procedure. There are inherent risks, such as causing septic shock by rupturing the bowels. (9/28/07) (9/15/14) COMPUTERIZED SOAP NOTES Computerized SOAP notes are acceptable as long as they are used in conjunction with the Oregon Practices & Utilization Guidelines. (4/16/92) CONTINUING EDUCATION Approval of Courses or Activities \" not specifically listed \" in the OAR Regarding Continuing Education issues that fall under OAR 811 -015-0025(9)(L) \"and any other course or activity specifically authorized by the OBCE.\" Continuing education requests are submitted to the administrative office for possible approval \"by the Board\" per OAR 811 -015-0025(9)(L). If the criteria of the course or activity is, in large part, similar to other described criteria in this rule (sections 8 and 9), but the activity or course is not specifically listed, the Executive Director is delegated authority by the Board to approve the course or activity. Other courses or activities that do not, \"in large p art,\" compare to given criteria of this rule are to be presented to the board for its approval at the next regularly scheduled board meeting. The term \"in large part\" may refer to courses or activities which are related to: Other institutions not specifically listed, but not excluded intentionally Other health -related \"studies,\" but not necessarily \"research\" Teaching \"chiropractic\" courses at other institutions (hospitals, gyms, nursing homes, etc.), and Teaching \"chiropractic\" courses not necessarily as continuing education (02/20/03) Board M ember CE Allowance A CE allowance for board members falls within the requirement of the CE rule. Members are improving and increasing their knowledge and proficiency in chiropractic practice by study and review of cases and policy issues. In addition it is already standard for OBCE subcommittees to receive CE credit for their services, so it would not be out of line for board members to receive credit. Board members agreed that a maximum of six hours CE will be allowed annually for any of the following - board member participation at regular bi -monthly meetings, subcommittee meetings, national conferences, or other board member represented event. (1/22/09) The Board determined that a maximum of six ( 6) CE credit will be allowed annually for professional s taff, committee members, and board -appointed mentors. In addition, any non -board member attending the P ublic Session of a board meeting will be credited up to two hours CE with a maximum of 6 hours per year. Hours will be credited based on sign -in/sign -out. (7/16/ 2015) Concussion CE, Mandatory New licensees are required to complete one hour of concussion training as found at the Centers for Disease Control's website by their first renewal. The training is titled, \"HEADS UP to Clinicians: Addressing Concussion in Sports Among Kids and Teens.\" (1/25/18) Credit Taken 13 Months Prior to Renewal If CE hours were taken 13 months preceding the current licensing renewal period, and the hours were submitted but NOT used toward last year's renewal, they may be used for the current license renewal period . (8/27/96) Educational Manual for Evidenced Based Chiropractic Chapters The OBCE approved 2 hours CE credit for the complete reading of each chapter of the Educational Manual for Evidence -Based Chiropractic. CAs or DCs may acquire credit for reading the Manual. (9/21/06 ; 12/1/11 ) Federation of Chiropractic Licensing Boards' (FCLB ) PACE approved programs The OBCE accepts all continuing education courses approved by the Federation of Chiropractic Licensing Boards ' PACE (Providers of Approved Continuing Education) program. The OBCE also accepts all continuing education courses or activities that meet the criteria and requirements of OAR 811 -015-0025. (11/18/04) National Board of Chiropractic Examiners Part IV Exam Assistants The Board considered the number of hours possible to contribute to the Part IV process and determined that the exam assistants will be allowed up to 19.5 hours continuing education credit. The OBCE will determine the means to establish how many credit hou rs should be approved per exam. (9/21/00 ) Teaching at a Health -Care Institution or Teaching Post-Graduate Education The purpose of this policy is to clarify the continuing education allowance in OAR 811 -015- 0025 (h) teaching courses at an accredited health care institution; and (i) teaching chiropractic continuing education courses. The Board has determined that a licensee may report a maximum eight (8) credit hours per year for teaching, if he or she is the person who develops the course outline, researches the course material and then teaches the class. Because of this determination, the administrative rule citation 811 -015-0025(9)(h) \"teaching courses at an accredited health care institution\" does not include teaching aides, clinic or c lass assistants, etc. In relation to both 811 -015-0025(9)(h) \"teaching courses at an accredited health care institution\" and (i) \"teaching chiropractic continuing education courses\"; a licensee may receive credit hours for the actual time teaching the c lass, not for the research and development of the program. (5/19/05; Eff. 8/1/05) COUNSELING PATIENTS A Chiropractor may only counsel within the area of chiropractic. Example: Counseling regarding sleep habits, eating habits, exercise, stress levels as i t affects the musculoskeletal system. (3/17/93) Chiropractors must stay within the guidelines as taught in chiropractic colleges. Counseling should relate to diagnosis and treatment. (1/21/93) CPAP MACHINE, ORDERING Ordering a CPAP machine and/or a sleep study is considered to be wi thin the DC's scope of practice in Oregon. Whether insurance will pay or not is another question. DEATH CERTIFICATES According to the Office of Vital Records, a DC can sign a death certificate. ORS 432.307, states, \"p hysicians \" sign death certificates . In ORS 432.005 , the definition of \" physician \" includes DCs ; so yes they can sign a death certificate. DIABETIC EDUCATION An Oregon chiropractic physician m ay provide diabetic education within chiropractic care. This education may include lifestyle counseling, nutritional support, and diagnostic testing for blood sugar levels. (03/06/02) DIPLOMATE STATUS Chiropractors in Oregon my claim a diplomate status if, in fact, they have earned that cre dential, otherwise they would be in violation of the Board's advertising rule. (10/25/00) DMV'S MEDICALLY AT -RISK DRIVER PROGRAM The Oregon Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) requires medical doctors and other health care providers (such as chiropractic, naturopathic doctors, physical therapists etc.) to report drivers with severe and uncontrollable functional or cognitive impairments that impact their ability to safely operate a motor vehicle. This could result in suspension of driving privileges. Chiropractic physicians are required to contact DMV to report a severe and uncontrollable impairment only if they are a patient's primary care provider. Otherwise, the chiropractic physician must submit a report to the patient's medical doctor or other prim ary care provider who then will determine whether to report. A chiropractic physician may still report to DMV on a voluntary basis, if needed. In the rare case where this may be an issue, a chiropractic physician should review the actual administrative rules, detailed information, and reporting forms found on the DMV's Web page which can be found at http://www.oregon.gov/ODOT/DMV/pages/driverid/medical.aspx Severe and uncontrollable impairments are defined as: Severe means the impairment substantially limits a person's ability to perform many daily activities, including driving. Uncontrollable means that the impairment cannot be corrected or compensated for by surgery, medication, therapy or adaptive devices. Once someone is reported to DMV, the driver may receive a Notice of Suspension in the mail informing the driver his/her license will be suspended 5 days from the date on the notice. At that point, the driver has several options. The driver can contact DMV and : Request the opportunity to demonstrate that he/she can still safely drive. Based on the informati on contained in the medical referral, the driver may also be required to provide DMV with additional medical information. The person will have to take the vision, knowledge and drive tests. The driver's license will be reinstated upon passing the required tests. Request an administrative hearing to appeal DMV's decision to suspend their driving privileges. Voluntarily give up their driving privileges by turning in their driver's license. For additional information, call the DMV Medical Program Coordinat or in Salem at (503) 945- 5295. (11/18/04) DOCTORS' TITLE ACT, ORS 676 (2011) 676.110 Use of Title Doctor (1) An individual practicing a health care profession may not use the title \"doctor\" in connection with the profession, unless the individual: (a) Has earned a doctoral degree in the individual's field of practice; and (b)(A) Is licensed by a health professional regulatory board as defined in ORS 676.160 to practice the particular health care profession in which the individual's doctoral degree was earned; or (B) Is working under a board -approved residency contract and is practicing under the license of a supervisor who is licensed by a health professional regulatory board as defined in ORS 676.160 to practice the particular health care profession in which the individual's doctoral degree was earned. (2) If an individual uses the title \"doctor\" in connection with a health care profession at any time, the individual must designate the health care profession in which the individual's doctoral degree was earned on all written or printed matter , advertising, billboards, signs or professional notices used in connection with the health care profession , regardless of whether the individual's name or the title \"doctor\" appears on the written or printed matter, advertising, billboard, sign or professional notice . The designation must be in letters or print at least one -fourth the size of the largest letters used on the written or printed matter, advertising, billboard, sign or professional notice, and in material, color, type or illumination to give display and legibility of at least one - fourth that of the largest letters used on the written or printed matter, advertising, billboard, sign or professional notice. (3) Subsection (1) of this section does not prohibit: (a) A chiropractic physician licensed under ORS chapter 684 from using the title \"chiropract ic physician\"; (b) A naturopathic physician licensed under ORS chapter 685 from using the title \"naturopathic physician\"; (c) A person licensed to practice optometry under ORS chapter 683 from using the title \"doctor of optometry\" or n\"; or 2395 (HB 2395 -A) (d) A podiatric physician licensed under ORS 677.805 to 677.840 from using the title \"podiatric physician.\" 676.120 Use of deceased licensee's name. Notwithstanding ORS 676.110, upon the death of any person duly licensed by a health professional regulatory board as defined in ORS 676.160, the executors of the estate or the heirs, assigns, associates or partners may retain the use of the decedent's nam e, where it appears other than as a part of an assumed name, for no more than one year after the death of such person or until the estate is settled, whichever is sooner. 676.130 Enforcement of ORS 676.110 and 676.120. Each health professional regulatory board as defined in ORS 676.160 shall notify the appropriate district attorney of any violation of ORS 676.110 and 676.120 which may be brought to the attention of such board. The district attorney of the county in which any violation of those sections tak es place shall prosecute the violation upon being informed of the violation by any person or by one of such boards. ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES A chiropractic clinic keeps daily charts electronically which indicate the provider of the services, and asks, \" Is it necessary for a chiropractic physician to print out and personally sign each daily chart note? \" No, it is sufficient to keep that information electronically as along as the provisions of OAR 811 -015-0005 (1) (b) are met, \"Every page of chart notes will identify the patient by name, and the clinic of origin by name and address. Each entry will be identified by day, month, year, provider of service and author of the record.\" On a related point, regarding electronic chart notes, a digital signature satisfies the requiremen t to sign each chart note entry . EMERGENCY FIRST AID Chiropractic physicians and Certified Chiropractic Assistants may provide emergency first aid. The following language was adopted into 684.025 new subsection (4): (a)\"This chapter does not prevent a person licensed under ORS 684.054 from providing emergency first aid, including administering emergency oxygen . (b) A person may not administer emergency oxygen unless the person has received training in the administration of oxygen. The State Board of Chiropractic Examiners shall adopt rules that establish training requirements. (c) As used in this subsection, 'emergency oxygen' means oxygen delivered at a minimum flow rate for a specified period of time as determined and r egulated by the United States Food and Drug Administration.\" (HB 2242, 2007) EMPLOYEE STATUS (See also, Multidiscipline Clinics ) In response to the question, \" Can a DC be an employee of a hospital or clinic that is multi - discipli nary with no majority int erest?\" the Board replied, \" First, you must determine if the employer is \"a business entity organized for the purpose of practicing chiropractic.\" It would be hard to argue that a hospital is organized for this purpose. The OBCE sees no problem from a business organization standpoint for a chiropractor or be employed by a hospital as long as the chiropractic physician is allowed to meet his/her responsibilities as outlined in ORS 684, OAR 811, and the Oregon Chiropractic Practice and Utilization Guidelin es. The same logic may hold true for some other employing entity, however it must not be a subterfuge to skirt the requirements of OAR 811 -010-0120. See also OAR 811 -010-0120 (8) multidisciplinary provisions. \" (5/28/03) In a follow -up question (from an acupuncturist clinic owner) the Board was asked, \"May we change the status of our independent contracting DCs to employee status? And, if so, c ould the business also hire a CA, and have the DC supervise? The Board determined that DCs may be hired as employees just the same as they may also employ other health professionals. As the independent contractor situation is fraught with issues, having employees is probably a safer way to operate. We do have a requirement that chiropractic clinics must be majority owned and controlled by licensed Oregon chiropractors, but that same rule allows for multi -disciplinary (Oregon health licensee) clinics as well. What we don't want is non -health care or corporate controlled prac tice of chiropractic health care. However, it is the DC's responsibility to be part of a clinic that is compliant with our laws and rules, including the Oregon Doctor's Title Act, which applies to L .Ac.'s as well. The clinic can hire a chiropractic assista nt as long as the DC is on site to supervise any practice as a CA. A complete explanation of our chiropractic assistant rules and policies can be found on the OBCE web page . Refer to OAR 811-010-0130 FAMILY/RELATIVES, TREATMENT OF Oregon chiropractors m ay treat family members and employees. However, chart notes and files must be kept as with any other patient. OAR 811 -010-0005 defines \"patient\" as \"any person who is examined, treated, or otherwise provided chiropractic services whether or not the person has entered into a physician/patient relationship or has agreed to pay a fee for services.\" FEE SPLITTING AND COMMISSIONS ABS Health Center, Inc . Marketing Plan The Oregon Board of Chiropractic Examiners advises that a chiropractic physician who partici pates in a marketing plan recently offered by ABS Health Center, Inc. based in Cincinnati, Ohio would be in violation of Administrative Rule 811 -035-0015, prohibition on fee -splitting in the referral of patients for services. ABS Health Center, Inc. atte mpted to enlist an Oregon chiropractic physician whereby they proposed to \"..bill back a marketing fee of $1,000 for every $3,500 cash patient closed (29% if the amount collected is less than $3,500)\" in return for an agreement whereby ABS leases a spinal decompression device for the doctor's office and conducts direct mail & broadcast media to recruit patients to use this device. Any Oregon chiropractic physician who agreed to this would be in violation of the Oregon Board of Chiropractic Examiner's Admin istrative Rule 811 -035-0015 which states, \"Unprofessional conduct means any unethical, deceptive, or deleterious conduct or practice harmful to the public; any departure from, or failure to conform to, the minimal standards of acceptable chiropractic practice; or a willful or careless disregard for the health, welfare or safety of patients, in any of which cases proof of actual injury need not be established. Unprofessional conduct shall include, but not be limited to, the following acts of a Chiropractic physician:... (24) Splitting fees or giving or receiving a commission in the referral of patients for services.\" In a letter to ABS, Executive Director Dave McTeague also said, \"We note that you have attempted to draw a distinction between Insurance/Medicare/Medicaid and cash pay patients, stating that fee splitting is OK if it involves cash pay patients. This letter is to inform you that the Oregon Board of Chiropractic Examiner's administrative rule does not make this distinction and that fee splitting for chiropractic patients of the magn itude proposed is illegal in Oregon.\" (5/18/06) Adjustments or Other Minor Gifts for Patient Referrals The practice of extending a free adjustment or other minor gift to patients referring a new patient for services is not a violation of the Board's admin istrative rule, unless in the Board's opinion the practice grows to be deceptive, unethical, deleterious or harmful to the public. OAR 811 -035-0015 states: \"Unprofessional conduct means any unethical, deceptive, or deleterious conduct or practice harmful to the public ; any departure from, or failure to conform to, the minimal standards of acceptable chiropractic practice; or a willful or careless disregard for the health, welfare or safety of patients, in any of which cases proof of actual injury need not be established. Unprofessional conduct shall include, but not be limited to, the following acts of a Chiropractic physician: ....(24) splitting fees or giving or receiving a commission in the referral of patients for services. (emphasis added). Commissi ons and Fees Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary's definition of \"commission,\" which speaks specifically to money, was considered. The Board noted that any gratuity between professionals and any business entity for patient referrals is unethical and harmful to the public. Any practitioner offering anything to another practitioner in exchange for a patient referral is subject to possible sanctions for unprofessional conduct. The Board suggests that chiropractors needing further advice or legal opinio n in regard to this policy, should contact their own attorney. (3/20/97) Recently a licensee asked the Board about solicitation s from a company in New York (ChiroAppointment.com). They claim to have names of patients who are interested in Chiropractic ca re. ChiroAppointment.com charge s $40 per referral. The Board determined t his is definitely a violation of the fee splitting rule , OAR 811 -035-0015 (24). See the article in the Summer 2009 BackTalk. Donating to a Non -Profit The Board was asked if a non-profit organization (i.e. private school) could advertise to their members (i.e. parents) that if they utilize the services of a particular chiropractic physician, the physician will donate 10% back to the non -profit organization. The Board determined this is not \"fee splitting\" and does not violate the spirit of OAR 811 -035-0015(24). (11/20/03) Leasing Agreements and Professional Referrals In May of 2003, the Board reviewed the following question regarding business practices under a multiple discipline clinic setting. The following response from the OBCE is not in any way legal opinion but only presents information about choices. For a ch iropractic physician who is leasing/renting office space, office personnel/billing services, that also leases/rents to other types of licensed professionals: Do \"walk -in\" patients requesting chiropractic services constitute a \"referral\" by the front desk person to that doctor? No. New OBCE policy: In review of this question the Board explored whether a \"referral\" by a parent company or other hea lth care provider constitutes fee splitting in percentage of gross lease arrangements (or percentage of pay arrangements). The Board received legal advice that it has broad authority to interpret the meaning of the fee splitting rule (OAR 8110 -035- 0015 (24)). Therefore the Board has determined that a chiropractor or health professional who enters into percen tage of gross leasing arrangement, and who may refer patients or receive referrals from the other party, does not constitute \"fee splitting\" if the business agreement is entered into prior to any patient base and there is not a true commission or fee paid per patient back to the chiropractor or other health professional. This same logic also holds true for percentage of patient base rate of pay. (5/28/03) Merchant F ees (Visa, MasterCard, Discover card charges) The OBCE does not consider it a violation of the fee -splitting rule for an advertiser to charge a merchant (i.e. chiropractic clinic) for the actual costs related to \"merchant fees.\" Typically these run in the 2 to 3% range of the purchase cost. Merchant fees specifically relate to the typical charges that vendors, such as those listed above, charge the merchant for the cost of using their credit card transaction service. Online sales of coupons Online sales of coupons or other services in which the prospective patient/customer pays a fee which then is shared between the advertising and the chiropractic clinic business are a violation of 811 -035-0015 (24) Splitting fees or giving or receiving a commission in the referral of patients for services. \" Following this ruling many of these advertisers modified their program to a flat rate advertising contract which does not violate this rule.\" Question: Is it fee splitting if the doctor's portion of the split is donated to a non -profit charity? Answer: Yes, as the advertiser still re ceives a split on a per patient basis. Question: A DC/L .Ac asks if she can advertise on Groupon as a L .Ac? Answer: The OBCE would not have jurisdiction as long as chiropractic & \"DC\" are not referenced in the advertisement. However, caution is advised. Question: A DC has a LMT in office; can that person advertise with a fee -splitting coupon advertiser? Answer: If the LMT is part of the chiropractic clinic, the answer is No. Question: A DC has a LMT in office, can that person advertise with a fee -splitting coupon advertiser, but also say that a free chiropractic exam is part of the offer, but the chiropractor gets no payment? Answer: The answer is No. (05/02/12) FUNCTIONAL CHIROPRACTIC NEUROLOGY The Board recognizes functional chiropractic neurology procedures and protocols as \"standard\" as per the Board's ETSDP rule. All chiropractic physicians who advertise that they hold special certification or training must be able to support those advertising claims with credible evidence . (03/17/14) HIPAA - IMMINENT DANGER EXCEPTION The OBCE recognizes the Imminent danger exception as outlined in HIPAA regulations. This policy communicates to chiropractic physicians that they may take appropriate action when faced with an imminent danger situation. See below an example of a recent situation. A chiropractic physician may, consistent with applicable law and standards of ethical conduct, use or disclose protected health information, if the chiropractic physician in good faith, believes the use or disclosure: (i)(A) Is necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to the health or safety of a person or the public; and (B) Is to a person or persons reasonably able to prevent or lessen the threat, including the target of the threat; or (ii) Is necessary for law enforcement authorities to identify or apprehend an indivi dual: (A) Because of a statement by an individual admitting participation in a violent crime that the covered entity reasonably believes may have caused serious physical harm to the victim; or (B) Where it appears from all the circumstances that th e individual has escaped from a correctional institution or from lawful custody, as those terms are defined in Sec. 164.501. This policy is based on current HIPAA regulations. Any chiropractic physician, who in good faith discloses protected health info rmation under the above mentioned criteria, will not be found to be in violation of any other patient confidentiality laws or rules. (9/20/05) HYPNOTHERAPY Hypnotherapy is defined as a type of psychological therapy and is not allowed within the scope of chiropractic practice. Hypnotherapy continuing education courses will not be accepted for license renewal credit. (09/15/14) INACTIVE LICENSE (Changing to active after five or more years) The following policy is an expansion of the current Oregon Administrative Rule 811 -010- 0086(8) which reads, \"Inactive licensees who apply for reinstatement after five or more years after the date of transfer to inactive license, or who cannot demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Board they have been in active p ractice during the preceding five years, may be required to establish their competency in the practice of chiropractic by (a) receiving a passing grade on all or part of an examination required by the Board; Or (b) submitting a letter showing proof of active prac tice and any disciplinary actions from the state boards where licensure is maintained. Any licensee who has maintained an inactive license for five or more years will be required to meet one of the following criteria before they may receive an active lice nse in Oregon: 1. Proof that the licensee was actively practicing at least one year of the past five. Proof should include evidence of malpractice insurance, clinic address, and license verification from the state where practicing. (A thumbprint will be req uired in the future once a more clear policy is established regarding that requirement.) Or 2. Show proof that one of the following exams was successfully passed in the past five years: a) National Board of Chiropractic Examiners' SPEC (Special Purposes Exam for Competency) b) National Board of Chiropractic Examiners' Part IV (practical) Exam c) Another state's licensing exam Or 3. Petition the Oregon Board (DC should explain why it is not necessary to prove competence, or explain the reason(s) why it is not necessary to meet these requirements to prove competence.) (11/99) INDEPENDENT MEDICAL EXAMINATION (I.M.E.) There is one standard for all chiropractors , whether they be IME, examining, treating, consulting or rehabilitating chiropractors. A pr ofessional relationship exists between the patient and the chiropractor, regardless of whether the chiropractor is the examining or treating doctor. Regardless of the role, the chiropractor is expected to perform an appropriate chiropractic examination b ased on the patient's current and past complaints, the manner of onset, and the elicited history. From this the chiropractor will make a diagnosis and determine any further procedures or tests necessary to clarify the diagnosis and/or prognosis. These may include, but not be limited to: diagnostic imaging, laboratory testing, or other specialized studies. If indicated , the evaluating chiropractor will propose any of the following: a recommended course of further care, a timeframe for reevaluation, treatmen t options or referrals; or discharge from care when appropriate. All examinations should include a \"functional chiropractic analysis.\" The Board has always assumed this was inherent in the P & U Guidelines, even though it was not included as specific language. The Board also stated that diagnosis should be based on pert inent history and examination findings, and reflected in the record. The issues arising out of an OBCE action in 2002 resulted in the following agreement between the OBCE and the respondent chiropractic physician. a. The doctor/patient relationship bet ween examiner and the examinee is limited to the examination, the opinion, and the review of the patient history and medical records provided; and does not include ongoing treatment monitoring. The examiner shall make important health information, diagnos is and treatment recommendations available to the patient, treating doctor, and patient's legal counselor or guardian via the independent report. Upon receipt of a signed written request from the patient or patient's legal guardian, a copy of the examinat ion report shall be made available as indicated in the request - to the patient and/or any other party designated by the patient. b. An independent chiropractic examiner should review the dictated medical opinion of a fellow panel member of an independe nt or insurer examination for its accuracy and completeness, and when necessary to clarify biomechanical or chiropractic reasoning, the independent chiropractor examiner should supplement the dictated medical opinion with his or her independent chiropracti c opinion. Administrative Rule 811 -015-0010 (Clinical Justification) also governs the conduct of independent examinations. Workers' Compensation IMEs. The Oregon Workers Compensation Department (OWCD) is required to maintain a list of providers auth orized to perform independent medical evaluations (IMEs) for workers' compensation claims as a result of SB 311 (2005). The OWCD director may remove a provider from the list after a finding of violation of standards of professional conduct for workers com p IME claims. Health professional licensing boards may adopt such standards or if they don't the default standards are published by the American Board of Independent Medical Examiners (ABIME). The OBCE considered this issue at their May 18, 2006 meeting and decided to accept the ABIME standards (below) and also submit to OWCD the OBCE's policy as additional applicable standards for IMEs performed by chiropractic physicians. ABIME Guidelines of Conduct: Physicians should: 1. Be honest in all communication s 2. Respect the rights of the examinees and other participants, and treat these individuals with dignity and respect; 3. At the medical examination: Introduce himself/herself to the examinee as the examining physician; Advise the examinee they are seeing him/he r for an independent medical examination, and the information provided will be used in the assessment and presented in a report; Provide the examinee with the name of the party requesting the examination, if requested; Advise the examinee that no treating physician -patient relationship will be established; Explain the examination procedure; Provide adequate draping and privacy if the examinee needs to remove clothing for the examination; Refrain from derogatory comments; and Close the examination by telling the examinee that the examination is over and ask if there is further information the examinee would like to add. 4. Reach conclusions that are based on facts and sound medical knowledge and for which the examiner has adequate qualifications to address; 5. Be prepared to address conflict in a professional and constructive manner; 6. Never accept a fee for services which are dependent upon writing a report favorable to the referral service; and 7. Maintain confidentiality consistent with the applicable legal jurisd iction. (7/18/06) INSURANCE - PIP OR HEALTH? A chiropractic clinic manager asked, \" Is it acceptable to bill a p atient 's regular health insurance after being in a car accident instead of the auto PIP insurance. \" The Board answered, \" No, ORS 742.526 states that the auto PIP insurance is primary. \" LYME DISEASE After review of the ETSDP Committee discussion notes, the OBCE adopted this statement at their November 2010 meeting: In the treatment of patients with Lyme disease, it is standard of c are for chiropractic physicians to participate adjunctively in the co -management with other appropriate health care providers having prescription writing privileges. The November 2010 Board minutes and the ETSDP ( Examinations, Tests, Substances , Devices and Procedures ) Committee discussion notes can be found on the OBCE's web site www.oregon.gov/obce . (Nov 2010) MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI'S) Chiropractic physicians in Oregon have a broad scope of practice for diagnostic testing. This includes ordering magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) when indicated. Some entities such as hospitals or third party payers have questioned whether chiropractic physicians may order MRIs. Chiropractors need direct access in orde ring magnetic resonance imaging to establish diagnosis for key conditions presenting in their patient population that directs management of care. Chiropractic physicians receive extensive training in this area. The training of doctors of chiropractic emphasizes the role of imaging, especially conventional radiography and magnetic resonance imaging. Chiropractic students are taught the basic physics, clinical applications, the advantages and limitations of these imaging modalities. In addition, chiropractic students are taught to interpret key bone and joint conditions as well as current imaging guidelines. In all requests for diagnostic testing, the re needs to be clinical justification (OAR 811 -015-0010). (2/3/2010) MASSAGE THERAPIST, SCOPE OF PRACTICE The Board of Massage Technicians determined on January 9, 1992, that it is the intent of licensed massage technicians to stretch soft tissues which must include the movement of the bony joints through the normal range of motion. Adjustments and manipulations are not identified as being within the scope of practice of massage therapists since the Board understands the intent of those two activities to be toward the joint surfaces and beyond the normal range of motion rather than the surrounding soft tissues. Although the Board realizes spontaneous manipulation of the joints may occur while doing massage, the intent is directed towards the soft tissues . MIGRAINE HEADACHES The Board determined that treating migraine headaches is within the Oregon c hiropractic scope of practice. MILITARY SERVICE (AND RENEWAL) 408.450 Duty to pay fees during military duty states, \"No person in the military or naval service of the United States, or any auxiliary corps thereof, while exercising any privilege in this state by virtue of having paid an annual license or privilege fee to any state board or commission for the rig ht to practice a profession or engage in a trade, shall lose such privilege because of failure to pay any such fee for any subsequent year during the period the person is in such service, unless dishonorably discharged therefrom. Upon being discharged from such service under honorable conditions and upon written application within 60 days of such discharge, every such person shall be restored to former status with respect to any such privilege without the necessity of paying the then current license fee.\" When the OBCE is made aware of a licensee's relevant military service, we will apply the above mentioned law accordingly. As regards continuing education, requests for waivers or delay in submission will be reviewed on a case by case basis as per the OBC E's hardship policy. The OBCE requests notification of this before the end of the licensee's renewal period. (July 2011) MINOR SURGERY CERTIFICATION The Board decided to accept procedures performed by WSCC's 12th quarter students in a (new) practical minor surgery elective course as part of their fulfillment of the rotation required for certification in Oregon. The course offered is in addition to the 36-hours (24 lecture and 12 lab) normally offered by WSCC. A maximum of 12 minor surgical cases may be acquired, and no more than two students may obtain credit for any one procedure. (11/99) MOTOR CARRIER PHYSICALS Chiropractors may perform physicals f or D.O.T. motor carrier certification. According to Title 49 -Transportation Chapter III -FHA Dept. of Transportation Subchapter B - Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations, chiropractors are included in the definition of \"medical examiner.\" \"Medical ex aminer means a person who is licensed, certified, and/or registered, in accordance with applicable State laws and regulations, to perform physical examinations. The term includes, but is not limited to, doctors of medicine, doctors of osteopathy, physician assistants, advanced practice nurses, and doctors of chiropractic.\" (Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations, sec. 390.5, revised 6/18/98 ) MULTI -DISCIPLINE CLINICS (See Doctors' Title Act) If any person (including a group or combination of individual p ersons) uses certain terms listed in the statute in any printed or written matter, or in any advertising, signs, or professional notices, then the particular health care profession under which the person is licensed also must be identified in print at leas t one -fourth as large as the title or name of the professional \"person\" or entity. The designation of the person's health care profession also must be displayed in such a way as to be at least one -fourth as \"legible\" as the title or name. To further expl ain, the following examples are given: If a multidiscipline clinic has a sign out front that says XYZ Rehab Clinic, then each profession involved in the clinic must be identified, such as: XYZ Rehab Clinic Medical Doctor, Chiropractor etc. (in one -fourth size print) If a person's name is used, then one must be identified as a chiropractor, i.e. John Doe, Chiropractor, or John Doe, Chiropractic Physician. The provisions of the \"Doctor's Title Act\", ORS 676.100 - 676.130 apply in the case of multidisciplinary organizations such as rehabilitation facilities in which various health -care professionals practice. The Doctors' Title Act is essentially a consumer protection statute. If any person (including a group or combination of individual persons) uses certain terms listed in the statute in any printed or written matter, or in any advertising, signs, or professional notices, then the particular health care pr ofession under which the person is licensed also must be identified in print at least one -fourth as large as the title or name of the professional \"person\" or business entity. The designation of the person's health care profession also must be displayed in such a name. The concept is to provide consumers with sufficient information to identify under which license a health care professional in Oregon is practicing. The purpose and effect of the statute do not differ if the \"person\" is an individual physici an or a multidisciplinary organization. A plain reading of the statutory terms demands that each health care professional working in a multidisciplinary clinic, institute, or group must identify his or her profession according to the \"one -fourth\" rule. (11 /3/92) ; (11/7/11) _________________________________ In May of 2003, the Board reviewed the following questions regarding business practices under a multiple discipline clinic setting. The following responses from the OBCE are not in any way legal opini ons but only presents information about choices. Employee status Can a DC be an employee of a hospital or clinic that is multi -disciplinary with no majority interest? First, you must determine if the employer is \"a business entity organized for the pu rpose of practicing chiropractic.\" It would be hard to argue that a hospital is organized for this purpose. The OBCE sees no problem from a business organization standpoint for a chiropractor or be employed by a hospital as long as the chiropractic phys ician is allowed to meet his/her responsibilities as outlined in ORS 684, OAR 811, and the Oregon Chiropractic Practice and Utilization Guidelines. The same logic may hold true for some other employing entity, however it must not be a subterfuge to skirt the requirements of OAR 811 -010-0120. See also OAR 811 -010-0120 (8) multidisciplinary provisions. (5/28/03) Independent Contractor Could an Oregon DC work as an independent contractor in the above illustration? The legal requirements for independent c ontractor status are outlined in state and federal law. The OBCE recommends chiropractors seek specific legal advice to determine their appropriate status as an independent contractor or employee. (5/28/03) Does the OBCE have specific recommendations for clauses in independent contractor contracts? The OBCE holds all chiropractors to the same standards of practice as outlined in ORS 684, OAR 811, and the Oregon Chiropractic Practice and Utilization Guidelines. The OBCE also recommends review of the OBCE Guide to Policy and Practice Questions. (5/28/03) NETWORK CHIROPRACTIC The Oregon Board of Chiropractic Examiners (OBCE) reviewed the conclusions of the advisory committee on E.T.S.D.P.s (examinations, tests, substances, devices and pr ocedures). The Board determined that Network Chiropractic is standard under Board's present rule. This is solely due to the fact that this technique is taught in a post -graduate continuing education course at Sherman College of Straight Chiropractic. (Ore gon Administrative Rule 811 -015-0070) In making this determination, the OBCE offers no opinion as to the clinical efficacy of Network Chiropractic. However, the OBCE has serious concerns with the utilization recommended for this technique. The OBCE recommends any Oregon chiropractic physician desiring to utilize Network Chiropractic protocols review OCPUG standards and administrative rules on clinical justification and excessive treatment. (10/15/98 , updated May 22, 2003) ) PAP SMEARS A medi cal testing service asked, \"May Oregon chiropractors order, collect and receive medical laboratory test results for pap smears ?\" Yes. DCs in Oregon have a very broad scope of practice in the area of diagnostics. They are also trained in ob -gyn and female health issues in chiropractic college. PARENTAL CONSENT When a patient is a child or \"minor,\" the chiropractic physician must have the permission of the parent, custodian or legal guardian before treating the patient. There is no law which specifically defines the type of permission that must be given. Written contracts are enforceable and may be preferred to oral contracts. OAR 811 -015-0006 states that the doctor shall preserve a patient's medical records, unless given written permission from the patie nt. However, a custodial parent or guardian of a minor patient may authorize disclosure to self or others. Disclosure must be made in situations involving court orders. OAR 811 -015-0006 implies that only the custodial parent is entitled to information conc erning the minor. However, laws governing domestic relations provide that the noncustodial parent shall not be deprived of the authority to consult with any person who provides treatment and that records shall be available to inspect and receive. (Attorney General opinion, July 1995 BackTalk Newsletter) PATIENT -CHIROPRACTOR RELATIONSHIP See Independent Medical Exams PATIENT, DEFINITION The definition of patient in the Oregon Administrative Rules for Chiropractors will mandate documentation of diagnosis and treatment using standard chiropractic methods. OAR 811 -010-0005(4): \"Patient\" means any person who is examined, treated, or otherwise provided chiropractic services whether or not the person has entered into a physician/patient relationship or has agreed to pay a fee for services. (Eff. 9/29/92) PATIENT RECORDS Disclosure of Deceased Patient Records The question was asked of the Board, \" May the parent of a patient who is deceased gain access to the patient's chiropractic patient record? \" Depending on the estate or probate of the deceased patient, the personal representative should be able to obtain the records. In probate and estate law, the personal representative steps into the shoes of the deceased and carries on with busines s on behalf of the deceased. If the chiropractor were to obtain from the personal representative (whether it is a parent or someone else) the probate documents showing they were in fact acting for the deceased and that they requested the records, those re cords should be releasable to the personal representative. The parent of a majority -aged patient would not be able to get those records unless they had an authorization, as the confidentiality of those records does not cease with the death of the patient . (04/17/03) Electronic Records If a chiropractic physician or clinic determines to transfer original paper patient records to an electronic medium and then destroy those paper records, the following conditions must be met: All relevant information must be transferred. A record or memo indicating who, what - when, where and how the transfer occurred must be made. The records may not be altered in any significant way. Color coded patient records must be captured as well. There must be a secure an d reliable backup system for all electronic patient records. The HIPAA law requires health care providers to \"maintain reasonable and appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards (a) to ensure confidentiality of the i nformation, and (b) protect against (i) threats or hazards to the security of the information; and (ii) unauthorized uses or disclosures of this information.\" (07/19/12) Faxed Records Requests It is acceptable and legal for a chiropractic physician to a ccept a faxed copy of a request for patient records; an original signature is not mandatory. (02/20/03) Ownership of patient records The Board determined that until the OBCE could rewrite OAR 811 -015-0005(1) regarding ownership of the patient records, i ts interpretation of that rule will be that \"including but not limited to\" means if the records are present, they must be included in the record . The statement is NOT interpreted to mean that ALL parts listed in section (1) must be (created, and thereby) included. (03/01) Release of patient records It is recommended the chiropractic physicians review the provisions of OAR 811 -015-0005, OAR 811 -015-0006 and 192.553 to ORS 192.581 Transfer of Patient Files A chiropractor is purchasing another clinic. Is it necessary for him to get a written consent for the seller to pass on the patient file and information to the buyer, from the seller's patients? In other words, do the existing patients need to give permission to transfer their health inform ation? Not in this case. This situation is covered in the OBCE Records rule (OAR 811 -015-0005 (5), which states, \"The responsibility for maintaining original patient records may be transferred to another chiropractic business entity or to another chiropra ctic physician as part of a business ownership transfer transaction.\" --------- The OBCE reviewed the intent of OAR 811 -015-0005 Records which states: \"(1) It will be considered unprofessional conduct not to keep complete and accurate records on all patients, including but not limited to case histories, examinations, diagnostic and therapeutic services, treatment plan, instructions in home treatment and supp lements, work status information and referral recommendations.\" The OBCE interprets this to mean that IF those parts exist, then they must be considered part of the record. For a more comprehensive understanding of the Board's expectations for patient record keeping, please refer to the entirety of OAR 811 -015-0005 and the Oregon Chiropractic Practice and Utilization Guidelines. Regarding the actual release of records, OAR 811 -015-0006, Disclosure Of Records (1) A Chiropractic physician shall make available within a reasonable time to a patient or a third party upon the patient's written request, copies or summaries of medical records and originals or copies of the patient's X - rays. (a) The medical records do not necessarily include the personal offic e notes of the Chiropractic physician or personal communications between a referring and consulting physician relating to the patient (Updated 11/18/04 ) On September 18, 2008, the OBCE clarified that, Independent Medical examiners are not required to keep records from other providers . On May 19, 2005, the OBCE further reviewed the records release administrative rule and policies. The following is an update to the previous policy. A prompt response to a valid request for release of patient records from a patient or authorized represe ntative is in the patient's and the public's interest. What is a \"reasonable time\" may vary depending upon the circumstances of the chiropractic physician and the request. The Board requests the records be released as soon as possible with the expectation that in most cases release would occur within 7 days. Without a valid reason, failure to release records within 30 days of a documented request may be considered to be a violation of OAR 811 -015-0006(1) and ORS 684.100 (t). OAR 811-015-0006 (2) states: \" The Chiropractic physician may establish a reasonable charge to the patient for the costs incurred in providing the patient with copies of any portion of the medical records. A patient shall not be denied summaries or copies of his/her medical records or X -rays because of inability to pay or financial indebtedness to the Chiropractic physician.\" However, charges for patient records must also comply with O RS 192.563 (below) passed as part of HB 2305 in 2003 and was updated in 2007 . 192.563 Health care provider and state health plan charges. A health care provider or state health plan that receives an authorization to disclose protected health information may charge: (1)(a) No more than $30 for copying 10 or fewer pages of writte n material, no more than 50 cents per page for pages 11 through 50 and no more than 25 cents for each additional page; and (b) A bonus charge of $5 if the request for records is processed and the records are mailed by first class mail to the requester wit hin seven business days after the date of the request; (2) Postage costs to mail copies of protected health information or an explanation or summary of protected health information, if requested by an individual or a personal representative of the individ ual; and (3) Actual costs of preparing an explanation or summary of protected health information, if requested by an individual or a personal representative of the individual. (5/19/05, 10/23/08) PHYSICAL THERAPY, BILLING The DC may provide treatment under the physical therapy codes. CAs may provide the therapies under DC supervision pursuant to ORS 684.155. (5/12/17) POST -DOCTORAL DIPLOMATES, USE OF INITIALS If a chiropractor has completed a legitimate diplomate course, he/she may use the post -doctoral initials as long as they comply with the OBCE rules on advertising and the Doctor's Title Act. PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS Chiropractors in Oregon are primary care physicians. (1/19/95 , 9/18/97) PYRAMID SELLING Pyramid schemes are illegal. (ORS Ch. 646.608(1)(r)) Pyramids are illegal because they are inherently fraudulent. In order to achieve the profits that are promised, a never -ending chain of participants must be recruited. At some point a saturation level wi ll be reached and no more recruits will be available. When that occurs, the most recent recruits cannot receive what has been held out to them to cause them to join, and they lose all or a part of what they paid to join the scheme. Some multi -level sales plans have the potential to run afoul of Oregon's law against pyramid schemes. A paper prepared by the Oregon Attorney General's office \"Multi -level Sales Plans in Oregon\" which addresses these issues is available by calling the Board office. However, a private attorney should be consulted for specific legal advice. RECORD KEEPING A doctor contacted the Board and asked, \"Is it required that I sign every dated entry even after having been gone on vacation (the relief doctor has already signed them)?\" Staff asked the board for further clarification of the rule: What is your interpretation? Does the single practitioner doctor have to initial every entry, as the rule seems to say; or is it enough to indicate elsewhere in the charts that all entries are perform ed by the DC? Current administrative rule 811 -015-0005 Records states , \"(1) (b) Every page of chart notes will identify the patient by name and one other unique identifier (date of birth, medical record number, etc.), and the clinic of origin by name and a ddress. Each entry will be identified by day, month, year, provider of service and author of the record.\" (4/10/15 ) The Board's interpretation of this rule is that in a sole practitioner office, the entries are sufficiently identified by the name on the cover sheet, or at the top of every page, as long as there are not other people s eeing and treating the patient. (07/19/12) Record Keeping - Chart Notes Completion While the best practice would be to complete the preliminary chart note within one day of the patient's visit, it is the policy of the OBCE that chart notes be completed within 72 hours of the patient's visit. The preliminary chart notes should be done wi thin 72 hours of a patient's visit and a finalized version entered into the record no later than 30 days following the patient visit . (11/20/14) REFLEXOLOGY (also listed under Chiropractic Assistants) The board was asked whether an UN -licensed person (either CA or DC) may provide reflexology treatment on chiropractic patients within the Oregon chiropractor's clinic. The OBCE responded that this is unlicensed treatment of the chiropractic patients in th e chiropractic clinic. The inquiring physician is also a naturopath and this may be allowed under his naturopathic license for his naturopathic patients. Given this difference in scope, the Board reminded the chiropractor to always remember to chart und er which license these services are being provided. In conclusion, ONLY a person actively licensed in Oregon as a DC, or Chiropractic Assistant (under the direct onsite supervision of an Oregon licensed chiropractor), may perform reflexology on the chiro practic patients. (11/20/08) REVOKED CHIROPRACTORS (WHAT THEY MAY AND MAY NOT DO) (1) A revoked chiropractor shall not practice chiropractic. They shall not practice or attempt to practice through employees, agents, associates, corporations, partnerships or any other entity. (2) A revoked chiropractor may not own and /or operate a chiropractic clinic. They must close the clinic and refrain from advertising or distributing any information that would likely cause the public to believe they are still licensed. (3) A revoked chiropractor may sell the clinic business to another licensed chiropractor and /or may become a landlord for the business real estate, leasing or renting the property to another person. A revoked chiropractor must not retain any management authority and may not share in the proceeds of the business other than bona fide contract or ren tal payments. (4) If a revoked chiropractor utilizes any portion of the clinic property for purposes other than practicing chiropractic, they must clearly segregate that portion from any chiropractic activity being conducted by lessors or purchasers. (6/21/91, 9/18/97) SATELLITE OFFICES If a chiropractor has two or more offices, they are to hang their original license (wall hanging) in the main office and hang their renewal certificate in a satellite office. A chiropractor may request a duplicate certificate ($5.00) from the OBCE. (11/29/91) SCHOOL PHYSICALS The Oregon Board of Chiropractic Examiners reaffirms that chiropractic physicians are qualified by \"clinical training and experience to detect cardiopulmonary diseases and defects.\" SB 160, enacted by the 2001 Oregon Legislature, specified that chiropractic physicians may perform school physicals provided they have this training. Chiropractic physicians have extensive training in diagnosis. This includes the ability to detect cardiopulmonar y diseases and defects, as well as a range of other conditions. Chiropractic professional education covers this subject in physiology, physical diagnosis and cardiorespiratory diagnosis classroom hours as well as internships in student clinic and outpatie nt clinic experience. Further, cardiovascular diseases and defects and related diagnosis are tested on four qualifying examinations performed by the National Board of Chiropractic Examiners (NBCE). NBCE Parts I, II, and III are given to chiropractic st udents as they proceed through college. The NBCE Part IV practical examination is required for licensure in Oregon. State law requires doctors to use the School Sports Pre -Participation Examination form approved by the Oregon Department of Education. This form also includes suggested exam protocols. It can be obtained from the OR School A thletics Association web page http://www.osaa.org/docs/forms/ Chiropractic physicians are further reminded that perf orming a school physical examination creates a doctor -patient relationship. The resulting records must be retained by the chiropractic physician for seven years or until the student (patient) is eighteen. These records may be stored off site (such as at th e school), as long as the DC has access and confidentiality is maintained. (However HIPAA requirements should be reviewed if this is done.) (07/18/02) TELEMARKETING Chiropractors may engage in telemarketing to gain patients. Neither the Board nor anyone else may restrict chiropractors from using telemarketing to advertise. However, the Board does have the ability to proscribe any advertisement that is false, or that could be misleading or deceptive. See OAR 811 -015-0045. As far as telemarketing is concer ned, OAR 811 -035-0015(24) does not prohibit giving or receiving a commission in the referral of patients for chiropractic services. Due to Article I, section 8 of the Oregon Constitution, administrative rule 811 -035-0015(24) does not apply to this situatio n. (7/22/96) TESTIMONIALS See also, \"Advertising Review Policy\" Question : I have been reading your guide on testimonials and I wanted to clarify what we are considering. We would like to film our patients, without a script about their experience with their problem, our office, our treatment, and their results. We are happy to put any disclaimer that is deemed important by the board, but feel that testimonials are extremely important to marketing chiropractic. I have noticed that most chiropractic websit es have testimonials. Please advise if it is ok to use honest, unscripted patient reports on our website. Answer : You're referring to the Federal Trade Commission's guide which is found on the OBCE's website. The OBCE doesn't have any rules prohibiting testimonials. It's probably best to obtain a written permission statement from any patients who provide testimonials. There is a rule which says advertising must not be deceptive or misleading. TRAVEL -TO-TREAT (See O RS 684.020 And 684.107) The Board does not have a set limit on the number of times an out of state chiropractor may come into Oregon as long as it is \"a single temporary assignment for a specific sporting, performing arts or educational event not to exceed 15 days\" and, the doctor \"is actively engaged in the practice of chiropractic in the state in which the person is licensed.\" The Board does not require notification that this provision of law is being utilized. (2/27/97, 9/18/97) X-RAY SERVICES BY CHIROPRACTIC PHYSICIA N A chiropractic clinic may take X -rays for another chiropractic physician or doctor. While this does not create a patient relationship with the doctor or other appropriately licensed person taking the films, the chir opractic clinic still has the obligation to abide by the x -ray rules found in OAR 811-030-0020 and OAR 811 -030-0030 (addressing shielding, contraindications such as pregnancy, diagnostic quality etc.) . In order to request films, the ordering doctor shoul d include the relevant diagnoses, area of clinical interest, birth date, etc . so that the clinic taking the films has a \"double check\" that ensures the proper films are taken . It is not necessary for the clinic taking the films to review the entire patient file to determine whether the views ordered are in fact clinically necessary. It is highly recommended all chiropractic physicians with x -ray equipment review OAR 811- 030-0020 and OAR 811 -030-0030, which also includes these record keeping requirements: The operator shall maintain a record on each exposure of each patient containing the patient's name, the date, the operator's name or initials, the type of exposure and the radiation factors of time, mA, kVp and target film distance, including those exposur es resulting in the necessity of repeat exposure for better diagnostic information such as patient motion or poor technical factors. For computerized and automated systems the recording of technique factors is not necessary as long as the equipment is cali brated and maintained. OAR 333 -106-045 requires the facility to determine the typical patient exposure for their most common radiographic examinations, i.e. technique chart. Each film shall be properly identified by date of exposure, location of X -ray dep artment, patient's name or number, patient's age, right or left marker and postural position marker and indication of the position of the patient. (3/18/10) X-RAY ( Which Views Are Necessary? ) Concerning views necessary for proper evaluation of the spine, the Board determined that it is up to the doctor's professional discretion. However, the standard recognized by the Board is OAR Chapter 333, Division 106(15) which states, \"The number of radiographs taken for any radiographic examination should be the minimum number needed to adequately diagnose the problem.\" Chapter 811 administrative rules and P & U Guidelines should be followed. (12/19/96) APPLICANTS (for Chiropractic) DISCLOSURE OF SCHOOL RECORDS This policy is regarding disclosure of school records without permission of the student. The Board staff may disclose: 1. name of school, 2. graduation date, and 3. transcript without grades or pass/fail information. (1991) EXAMINATION Appeals Oregon law chapter 684 does not contemplate appeals. The Board does NOT allow any appeal process and it may deny a license based on failure to pass the test. (5/18/93) Exam Schedules The OBCE will offer at least four Oregon specific examination opportunities each year. Retakes will be given each examination. (1 0/16/97) National Board of Chiropractic Examiners (NBCE) Part IV Effective February 1, 1998, The Oregon Board of Chiropractic requires the National Board of Chiropractic Examiners' (NBCE) Part IV exam for licensure in Oregon. All candidates taking the state boards, must show proof of a passing grade in Part IV (in addition to all other application requirements) . Candidates will be required to take three (Oregon specific) exams. The three exams include Ethics/Jurisprudence/Public Health, Obstetrics/Gyne cology, and Minor Surgery/Proctology. Reciprocity candidates are not affected by the Board's decision to accept Part IV. Generally, reciprocity candidates are not required to test in any practical exams. (7/18/96; 7/9/98) Physiotherapy Minimum Educational Requirement The Board determined that for a chiropractic college to meet our 120 -hour requirement, all their hours must be documented classroom hours. The Board said it was too hard to document clinical hours toward this requirement. (8/20/98) Special Purposes Examination for Competency (SPEC) Reciprocity applicants who lack the required NBCE examinations may request the OBCE's authorization to take the NBCE Special Purpose Examination for Competency (SPEC) under the provisions of ORS 684.052. The Executive Director may authorize this unless there are other reasons for OBCE review. (7/31/2003) Waivers (from application/examination deadlines) The Executive Director will determine a finding of fact in each request for waiver of deadlines for app licants wanting to take the Oregon specific examinations and will send the information to each Board member for them to approve or deny. (9/18/97) FELONY RECORD The Board may deny a chiropractic applicant licensure with a felony conviction in areas that could be harmful to patients. ORS 684.100(1) states, \"The board may refuse to grant a license...upon the following grounds: ... (d) A conviction of a felony or mis demeanor involving moral turpitude.\" Any applicant denied a license for this reason has a right to appeal and make his/her case in a contested case hearing. Upon review of the hearing officer's recommendations, the Board will then consider whether to app rove the application, with or without conditions, or continue to deny. PRE -PROFESSIONAL LIBERAL ARTS AND SCIENCES POLICY At its November 2001 meeting, the OBCE reconsidered its policy on pre -professional education for license application in Oregon. The B oard determined that it will accept the Council on Chiropractic Education's (CCE's) standards defined for two -year's education. (11/ 29/01) WORKING UNDER A LICENSED CHIROPRACTOR Chiropractic college interns (12th quarter students) engaged in clinical studies during the period of the students' enrollment in an institution authorized to confer a doctoral degree in chiropractic may work in a chiropractic clinic when the doctor, who must have faculty status with a chiropractic college, is teaching them adjustive technique in an actual 'hands on' situation. The student may perform chiropractic in an ins truction mode under the doctor. The doctor is to refer to the student as an intern or chiropractic student. The student is not to be called a doctor . The doctor and student must get permission from the patient before the student works on the patient. (8/15/91, 7/17/97, 7/9/98) CERTIFIED CHIROPRACTIC ASSISTANTS The Certified Chiropractic Assistant (CCA) may perform physiotherapy, electrotherapy, o r hydrotherapy once he or she has received the certificate from the Board. The CCA scope of practice does not include performing physical examinations, taking initial histories, taking X - rays, interpretation of postural screening, doing manual muscle testi ng or performing osseous adjustments or manipulations. (See OAR 811 -010-0110) ANY TRAINED PERSON (INCLUDING CERTIFIED CA S) MAY PERFORM THE FOLLOWING 1) Clarify initial patient intake history, which includes recording or performing height, weight, blood pressure, temperature, and pulse rate. 2) Record hand dynamometer readings. 3) Demonstrate, teach, check and review with patients the doctor's prescribed exercis es 4) Facilitate provision of vitamins and/or supplements to patients as ordered by the doctor. 5) Relay doctor's instructions to the patient on recommendations of nutritional needs. 6) Facilitate provision of cervical pillow or support as recommended by the doctor . 7) Make follow -up phone calls to patients on their progress as instructed by the doctor. 8) Schedule return office visits for patients as instructed by the doctor. 9) Schedule referrals as instructed by the doctor. 10) Check patient's body fat percentage. 11) Perform po stural screenings under the on -site supervision of a chiropractor, but only a Chiropractor may interpret the information. 12) May apply electrodes and conduct surface EMG testing, but the doctor has to interpret the results. 13) This list is not intended to be all -inclusive. (Updated 11/16/95, 7/18/96 ; 11/20/08; 4/3/09) ASSISTANT LICENSES , VALID IN OREGON A Chiropractor who practices in Taiwan which recognizes United States Chiropractic licenses asked, \" If it is possible, can the State of Oregon issue a chiropractic assistant license for the chiropractic assistants here in Taiwan? The Board responded \" No. A chiropractic assistant certificate is only valid in the State of Oregon and under the supervision of an Oregon licensed chiropractor. \" COLONICS OR COLONIC THERAPY See also \"Colonic Therapy\" under \"Chiropractors\" The board determined that colonic therapy is hydrotherapy and is allowed within the scope of chiropractic practice , but CCAs are not allowed to perform it due to the higher risk of the procedure. T here are inherent risks, such as causing septic shock by rupturing the bowels. (9/28/07) (9/15/14) COMPUTERIZED MUSCLE AND INCLINOMETER TESTING Certified Chiropractic Assistants may not do computerized muscle or inclinometer testing. The Board considers this to be part of the physical examination. (9 /21/00) A follow up request was made asking if the inclinometer may be used by a Chiropractic Assistant. The Board maintains that this i s part of the physical examination; the scope of practice does not allow it. (10/26/11) (DIRECT) SUPERVISION OF CLINIC STAFF The OBCE was asked if licensed chiropractic assistants could provide therapies in a business space next door to the clinic. The OBCE responded that the chiropractic assistant who is supervised needs to be in the same office space (defined as the same building or space contiguous) as the supervising doctor. O AR 811 -035-0001 states, \" 'Direct supervision ' means that the licensed Chiropractic Physician is physically present in the clinic, is monitoring the activities of the supervisee in the clinic and is available to intervene, if necessary. \" If an employee a nd/or independent contractor is independently licensed to perform prescribed services within their scope of practice they may do so without direct supervision of the chiropractic physician. (7/31/03 ) (12/1/11) ENGLISH PROFICIENCY REQUIREMENT FOR CA APPLIC ANTS The Board reviewed this matter in light of a question from a licensee - May he interpret or provide an interpreter for non -English speaking CA applicants (to successfully complete the application and exam )? The OBCE surveyed other state health regul atory boards and determined tha t most other boards require that licensees be English -speaking proficient. Many of the other health -related licensing boards already have a policy, rule, or statute requiring applicant's to be English -speaking. The Board de termined that ALL (CA) applicants must be proficient in English in order to complete the chiropractic assistant licensing process in Oregon . (May 2008) FELONY RECORD The Board may deny a certified chiropractic assistant applicant certification with a felony conviction in areas that could be harmful to patients. ORS 684.100(1) states, \"The board may refuse to grant a license...upon the following grounds: ... (d) A convict ion of a felony or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude.\" Any applicant denied certification for this reason has a right to appeal and make his/her case in a contested case hearing. Upon review of the hearing officer's recommendations, the Board will then consider whether to approve the application, with or without conditions, or continue to deny. INITIAL TRAINING FOR CA APPLICANTS All initial training for Chiropractic Assistants must be completed according to OAR 811 -010- 0110. Chiropractic Stud ents Training To Be Chiropractic Assistants Seventh (7th) quarter students and above may use the completed course in Physiological Therapeutics in lieu of the OBCE's Initial Training Program to be a certified chiropractic assistant. A copy of their transcript or a letter from the course instructor on college letterhead will be accepted as proof of completion of the course. See OAR 811 -010-0045 (3) for other specifics. (4/15/93) Massage Therapists The Board determined that a massage therap ist must acquire the 12 initial training because they are not trained in the hydrotherapy or electrotherapy. (11/99) (01/11) Physical Therapist Assistants Question: May PTAs submit their physical therapist assistant education in lieu of the OBCE's requir ed 12-hour initial training course to be licensed as a certified chiropractic assistant (CCA)? The Board determined that PTA's will be waived from the 12-hour initial training requirement if the PTA education was completed within the past five years , or if they have been continuously employed in the past five years. (11/99) (01/11) Online Initial Training (also see Webinar Training below) The Board has determined that CA initial training course s (ITC) may be presented online for the 8-hour didactic (lecture) portion of the required 12 hours . An approved program will meet t he following criteria Obtain OBCE approval prior to any prese ntation being offered Monitor and verify attendance (which must be no less than the 8 hours required ) * Provide adequate testing frequently throughout the training ** and Provide a certificate of completion to each attendee * Monitoring/Verifying Attendance - Each pre -approved course must incorporate a monitoring system, and verify the online attendance. The learner must login using a unique username and password. The system should log the amount of time the learner spends on the course and the learner cannot complete the course in less time than is assigned to the particular course. ** Testing - Interactive test questions must be presented throughout the course. Current board -approved trainers (and their related courses) may be converted to an online course meeting the above criteria without additional board approval. (The required (4 -hours ) hands -on portion must still only be provided live.) (9/15/14) Other Training or Certification If an applicant has a current certificate or license from another state , or adequate documentation of training, the Board may waive the requirements for the initial training course. (11/99) Supervising DC , Training by the Due to a need for more initial training courses for chiropractic assistants, the Board determined that a supervising DC may train his applying CA. The DC must be in attendance, and directly supervising the CA during the training. The Board determined that the DC must keep adequate d ocumentation and submit evidence to the Board that the CA was appropriately trained according to OAR 811 -010-0110. The OBCE developed a form which will meet all the points of this policy and the administrative rule. The form is available by request at the administrative office. The Supervising DC and chiropractic assistant should understand that this does NOT preclude certification by the OBCE. This process addresses the 12-hour initial training only. Each assistant must still apply with the OBCE, take t he open book exam and submit the required fees. OAR 811 -010-0110 is still in effect and included in the chiropractic assistant application packet. (11/99) (01/11) Webinar Training It was proposed to the Board that webinars be allowed as a training tool for the eight (8) hours didactic portion of the Chiropractic Assistants initial training. After considering a draft of the proposed outline/presentation, the Board approved webinars as a viable option for the training. The Board continues to deny video p resentations as they want the live person to person interaction. Any program offered for chiropractic assistant initial training must be pre -approved by the Oregon Board of Chiropractic Examiners (Board). Note: \"Pre -approval\" is already required with current administrative rule. The Board will ONLY consider for pre -approval a minimum eight (8) hour program which covers all modules of the Board's required didactic training outline. These programs may be offered either in -person or by LIVE (not pre -recorded ) webinar. This policy is drafted to better implement administrative rule 811 -010-0110(2)(a)(i) through (iii). When a program for approval is a webinar, it must meet the additional following criteria: 1. The proposed program must include technology which enables participants and the instructor to ASK and ANSWER questions in real time 2. Must offer some evaluation after EACH module of OBCE's required outline; the Board requires a minimum of 4 questions be ask ed 3. The sponsor/program must be able to demonstrate that interaction on the part of participants is required throughout the presentation. (for example: webcams, question/answer, etc.) 4. Answers to survey questions must be recorded and made available to the Board, if requested for audit purposes. 5. The webinar software and/or vendor must be able to record the ACTUAL time each participant spends \"in\" the webinar. 6. All webinar sponsors/programs must provide timely evidence of attendance after each full (minimum eight hours) program is completed. This report will include: Actual time each participant spends in the webinar, each participants name and e -mail address, Evidence of participation for each attendee (questions asked, answers to poll questions, etc.) The board reserves the right to revoke approval for any training vendor that does not comply with the guidelines listed above at any time. It also reserves the right to not accept the training of Chiropractic Assistant applicants who enroll in webinar trainin g but there is insufficient evidence in the opinion of the Board to conclude that they attentively participated in such training by an approved vendor. (08/16/12) KINESIOTAPING METHOD May a certified C hiropractic Assistant perform \"kinesiot aping\" ? The kinesiot aping Method involves taping over and around muscles in order to assist and give support to, or prevent, over - contraction. The Board determined if the supervising DC is trained in the taping method, that he or she may also train the certifie d CA also to perform the method in the clinic, and only while the DC is on premise. The Board considers this a physiotherapy . (3/15/07) The Board was asked for additional clarification on the Kinesiotaping policy. \" Does the board consider the two metho ds - 'Kinesiotaping ' and 'taping ' - one in the same? \" Yes. The Board hasn't distinguished a difference. And, r eferring to the policy's second sentence, the question was asked, \" If the DC is trained in the taping does this mean the DC needs to be trained t o the extent that he holds a 'certification ' in Kinesiotaping, or taping?\" No. The training received in chiropractic college is sufficient. Other reasonable training would be acceptable also. (05/15/12) LASER LIGHT THERAPY Refer to Laser Light Therapy in Section 1 Procedures. MASSAGE, OVERSIGHT REQUIREMENTS See also, \"Therapies, including Massage \" Question : Does this mean the supervising chiropractic physician should be entering the treatment room periodically or seeing the patient during the same appointment for massage therapy (performed by the CCA)? Answer : No, the OBCE's policy doesn't say that, although it may be advisable as regards the particular patient's needs. We would presume there is other contact between the doctor and patient. If a chiropractic clinic decides to have CCAs provide full body massages without having a meaningful patient relationship, the OBCE appreciates the concerns that would raise. That said, massage can be an important part of a chiropractic wellness program. Abuses of this privilege could lead to additional OBCE rulemaking mandating additional training for CCAs who provide full body massages or limiting their scope in this area. Myofascial release is allowed within the CA scope of practice. (07/20/17) QUAN TITATIVE FUNCTIONAL CAPACITY EVALUATIONS (QFCE) QFCEs are not within the chiropractic assistant scope of practice. The QFCE requires the doctor's clinical judgment for evaluation and performance. CAs do not have the required training for this. The board also determined that QFCEs may not be performed by a Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist (CSCS) under the OBCE's \"Any Trained Person\" policy, thus a CSCS may not perform this as part of the chiropractic clinic's services in or out of the clinic . The QFCE has to be performed by the chiropractic physician (or other licensed health provider within their scope of practice). (3/21/13) RANGE OF MOTION A chiropractor submitted a letter inquiring whether chiropractic assistants or any \"trained personn el\" may perform range of motion tests. The Board determined that chiropractic assistants or other persons may not perform range of motion tests. According to the administrative rule 811-010-0110(7) for CAs, it is clear that \"the scope of practice does no t include performing physical examinations...\" The performance of range of motion tests is definitely a physical examination. (12/99) REFLEXOLOGY The board was asked whether an UN -licensed person (either CA or DC) may provide reflexology treatment on chir opractic patients within the Oregon chiropractor's clinic. The OBCE responded that this is unlicensed treatment of the chiropractic patients in the chiropractic clinic. The inquiring physician is also a naturopath and this may be allowed under his naturopathic license for his naturopathic patients. Given this difference in scope, the Board reminded the chiropractor to always remember to chart under which license these services are being provided. In conclusion, ONLY a person actively licensed in Oregon as a DC or Chiropractic Assistant (under the direct onsite supervision of an Ore gon licensed chiropractor), may perform reflexology on the chiropractic patients. (11/20/08) REIKI A Doctor of Chiropractic asked if his certified C hiropractic Assistant may practice Reiki , a form of massage therapy, in his office without his supervision . The Board determined that the certified CA may perform this type of massage ONLY if the supervising DC is also Reik i-trained , and on premise to supervise. If the certified CA , trained in Reiki, is also an Oregon licensed massage therapist, then that is a lready allowed with the LMT scope of practice . (3/15/07) TERMINOLOGY The use of the terms for chiropractic assistants, \"massage therapist\" and \"therapist\" are misleading and should not be used, as per the Oregon Administrative Rule 811-015-0045 . The Board also determined that the designation \"CCA\" or \"CA\" (see below) shoul d be spelled out, since many people would not recognize the acronym. The rule was changed so that \"Certified\" has now been dropped and we are now referring to them simply as \"Chiropractic Assistants.\" (9/16/2008) THERAPIES, Including Massage All CCA provided therapies must be performed under the supervision of a chiropractic physician who must always be on premise. A CCA could provide a full body massage if the chiropractic physician prescribes it , and provides instruction on how to do it. Whateve r therapy is provided by a CCA has to be justified by the results of the history, examination, and diagnosis for each chiropractic patient, as governed by the Oregon Chiropractic Practice and Utilization Guidelines and other applicable administrative rules . A CCA may not provide any therapy that is not part of chiropractic patient care. (1/25/12) VITALS, CONTINUING EDUCATION Newly certified chiropractic assistants must submit to the Board proof of completion of two hours in Vitals CE at their first rene wal. Training is to include lecture and hands -on. For the hands -on portion , 20 documented checks of each of the following must be performed: blood pressure , pulse, respiration *; and b ody temperature . A minimum of 10 different people must be tested. The OBCE has a prescribed form to log the vitals. * Measuring respiration can be done by auscultation (listening with a stethoscope) to count the breaths or observing movements of the chest. 3/17/16 WORKING FOR OTHER HEALTH -CARE PROVIDERS A certified chiropractic assistant (CCA) is only certified to work in a chiropractic office under the direction of a licensed chiropractic physician. Other health care providers may not have their personnel take the Board's CCA exam for certification in their office.

Is any additional training required in order for DCs to perform the FAA BasicMed Medical examination?

The \"BasicMed\" FAA Medical examination is within the training and scope of practice for Doctors of Chiropractic within Oregon. The Board does not ma ke a statement as to whether the FAA should allow Oregon DCs to perform these exams as the Board does not make FAA rules and does not interpret those rules.

Source of CBD must be labeled - hemp or marijuana. Unless the product is used for the sale of inhalant delivery systems and their components, then must be 21 years of age or older. Regulatory Body Oregon Health Authority (OHA) Oregon Liquor Control Commission (OLCC) Oregon Department of Agriculture (ODA) *Please note that these regulatory bodies above may have specific statutory or rule requirements for sale of products. Please contact those agencies directly for further information. All hemp items sold at retail in Oregon must comply with the product t esting required for like - marijuana items (solvents, pesticides, etc.). PROCEDURES 1. Medical Use of Cannabidiol (CBD) As of the date of the enactment of this policy, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) continues to ban the use of CBD in food products and restricts its use as a dietary supplement. Based \"on the evidence, FDA has concluded that THC and CBD products are excluded from the dietary supplement definition under sections 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii) of the FD&C Act, respectively. Under those provisions, if a substance (such as THC or CBD) is an active ingredient in a drug product that has been approved...or has been authorized for investigation as a new drug for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public, then products containing that substance are outside the definition of a dietary supplement. FDA is not aware of any evidence that would call into question its current conclusions that THC and CBD products are excluded from the dietary supplement definition under sections 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii) of the FD&C Act.\" The FDA has also issued warning letters to companies selling CBD products claiming that they prevent/treat diseases like cancer, diabe tes, psychiatric disorders, etc. Examples: \"soothing tincture for chronic pain,\" \"CBD can successfully reduce anxiety symptoms,\" \"For many, CBD holds the answers to treating depression.\" 2. Clinical Justification. The Board's existing rules require that th e chiropractic physician utilize clinical rationale and justification that, \"within accepted standards and understood by a group of peers, must be shown for all opinions, diagnostic, and therapeutic procedures. Accepted standards mean skills and treatment which are recognized as being reasonable, prudent. and acceptable under similar conditions and circumstances.\" 3. Scope of Practice. In considering the inclusion of new substances in the practice of chiropractic, the Board may take into account all relevan t factors and practices, including, but not limited to: the practices generally and currently followed and accepted by persons licensed to practice chiropractic in the state, the teachings at chiropractic schools accredited by the Council on Chiropractic E ducation or its successor at any time since 1974, relevant technical reports published in recognized journals, and the desirability of reasonable experimentation in the furtherance of the chiropractic arts. A chiropractic physician may utilize substances that are supported in peer reviewed literature, which has clinical rationale, valid outcome assessments measures, is consistent with generally recognized contraindications to chiropractic procedures, and where the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the patient. 4. Current Conclusions As chiropractic physicians do not have prescription rights within Oregon statute, there is no statutory authority to allow chiropractic physicians to recommend or prescribe marijuana, CBD, hemp, or products derive d from these substances. To dispense, use, or sell topical products derived from marijuana or hemp, licensees must abide by the laws and rules established by the OHA, OLCC, and ODA, as applicable. This is an explanation of OBCE's position and licensees act at their own risk with regard to federal prohibitions/requirements. According to the FDA, under the FD&C Act, it is illegal to market and sell CBD as a dietary supplement. https://www.oregon.gov/pharmacy/Imports/Cannabidiol_CBD_Informational_6.2019.pdf Additionally, chiropractic physicians cannot sell recreational marijuana unless properly licensed through the OLCC to do so. -Licensing -General.aspx .)

Investigational means further study is warranted, eviden ce is equivocal or insufficient , the patient has to evaluate their own risk and it is not standard. Standard means that it is taught in a chiropractic college or otherwise accepted in the chiropracti c profession. Definition of Clinical Thermography Thermography, when used in a clinical setting, is an imaging procedure that detects, records, and produces an image (thermogram) of a patient's skin surface temperatures and/or thermal patterns. The p rocedure uses equipment that can provide both qualitative and quantitative representations of these temperature patterns. Thermography does not entail the use of ionizing radiation, venous access, or other invasive procedures; therefore, the examination poses no harm to the patient. Clinical thermography is appropriate and germane to chiropractic practice whenever a clinician feels a physiologic imaging test is needed for differential diagnostic purposes. Clinical thermography is a physiologic imaging tec hnology that provides information on the normal and abnormal functioning of the sensory and sympathetic nervous systems, vascular system, musculoskeletal system, and local inflammatory processes. The procedure also provides valuable diagnostic information with regard to dermatologic, endocrine, and breast conditions. Clinical thermography may contribute to the diagnosis and management of the patient by assisting in determining the location and degree of irritation, the type of functional disorder, and perh aps the treatment prognosis. The procedure may also aid the clinician in the evaluation of the case and in determining the most effective treatment. Clinical breast thermography is an investigational procedure that may be performed by a doctor or technici an who has been adequately trained and certified by a recognized organization. However, the interpretation of the thermal images will only be made by health care providers who are licensed to diagnose and hold credentials as board certified clinical thermo graphers or diplomates from a recognized organization. This is meant to insure that directed care and proper follow -up recommendations will be made available to the patient if warranted by the interpretation of the images. Breast Thermography Education Adequate training in thermographic imaging is a necessity to insure quality image acquisition, accurate interpretation, and public safety. Minimum training as a technician (proven with core curriculum or post graduate training from the ACA, ACCT, ITS, IACT , AAT, or AAMII only) is required before breast thermography may be used in chiropractic practice. If a chiropractor is to engage in interpreting images from outside offices, the chiropractor needs to be board certified or a diplomate in thermology from th e ACA, ITS, IACT, AAT, or AAMII. A chiropractor may also image the breast as long as the images are sent out for interpretation by an appropriately trained health care provider who is licensed to diagnose and is board certified; or a chiropractic physician who holds a diplomate in thermol ogy from the ACA, ACCT, ITS, IACT, AAT, or AAMII. This same health care provider must have obtained training in breast thermography as part of their core curriculum in board certification or diplomate thermology courses, or obtained post -graduate training under the tutelage of a recognized expert in the field (that can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the OBCE). Certified Clinical Thermographic Technicians : (DCs or other trained persons obtaining the images) Training courses leading to certificatio n are comprised of both formal classroom hours and practical imaging experience. Courses typically cover basic thermal imaging principles, patient management, laboratory and imaging protocols. Candidates that complete a recognized course of study, and succ essfully pass the required examination(s), hold credentials as certified clinical thermographic technicians. Certified Clinical Thermologist and Diplomates: (DCs doing interpretation) Educational courses at this level are comprised of both formal classro om hours and practical imaging experience. The course material typically covered includes: a review of relevant anatomy and physiology, pathophysiologic processes and their relation to thermographic presentations, laboratory and imaging protocols, patient management, thermal imaging principles, image analysis and interpretation, thermographic correlation to a mammogram or MRI and a time period of practical field experience. Candidates that complete a recognized course of study, and successfully pass the req uired examinations, hold credentials as board certified clinical Infrared Imagers or thermologists. A typical course of study includes: a review of breast anatomy and physiology, pathophysiologic breast processes and their relation to thermographic present ations, laboratory and imaging protocols, patient management, thermal imaging principles, image analysis and interpretation, and a time period of practical field experience. Supervised I nstruction: In the event that the core curriculum of a board certi fied or diplomate course did not cover breast thermography, post -graduate training under the tutelage of a recognized expert in the field (expert in the field that can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the OBCE) would provide the training needed for breast thermography interpretation. All the standards and practical study listed above apply. Certifying Organizations: Educational courses in clinical thermography are provided through recognized organizations. Due to the many non -clinical uses of the rmographic imaging, only organizations specifically founded to serve the educational needs in clinical thermography are recognized. The currently recognized training organizations are the: American Chiropractic Association, American College of Clinical The rmology, International Academy of Clinical Thermology, American Academy of Thermology, and past graduates of the American Academy of Medical Infrared Imaging (no longer in existence). Equipment Guidelines In order to provide quality image production and a ccurate clinical interpretations, certain minimum equipment standards should be maintained, only FDA cleared equipment for thermography of the breast shall be used. (Note: No evidence has been presented that this equipment is actually \"FDA approved\".) Informed Consent Any chiropractic clinic providing breast thermography imaging must use the attached informed consent form. This is in addition to verbal communication with the patient to ensure their understanding of these informed consent provisions, the in vestigational status and that this is adjunctive to other standard diagnostic imaging or examination.

Conclusion of Treatment 11 CHAPTER III RECORD KEEPING AND REPORT WRITING The quality of a physician's ability to provide efficacious health care is dependent on their ability to gather, organize, analyze , and make decisions on clinical data. Good decisions are the result of accurate and complete facts being retrievable from a patient's records. Therefore, documentation of the patient's medical history, presenting complaint(s), progression of care, diagno sis, prognosis , and treatment plan should be reflected in the record keeping and written reports of the patient file. Some aspects of this file have been included in Chapter I. Components of this file should include: I. Patient History and Examination Reco rds There is considerable variation in how physicians develop and record a clinical history and examination findings. The reader is referred to Chapter I, Sections I and II for a summary of the suggested guidelines. II. Chart Notes Chart notes should be re corded at each visit in a form which may be understood by any medical/healthcare provider . While the patient's history indicates their status at the time of the initial visit or at the onset of a new condition, the progress record (often called chart note s) reflects the patient's state of health at subsequent points of time. The minimum acceptable records should create a story of the patient's response to the physician's management of their case. This story should be legible and clear enough to allow another medical/healthcare provider to assume management of the case after a n initial review of the chart notes. Full SOAP charting at each visit, while recommended, is not required, but components of the file should include: A. Subjective complaints The patient's complaints should be recorded at each visit (in the patient's own w ords when possible) indicating improvement, worsening or no change , or any significant event since the last vis it with provider . B. Objective findings Changes in the objective signs of a condition should be noted at each visit in the doctor's own words. C. Assessment or diagnosis It is not necessary to update this category at each visit. However, periodic clinical re - evaluations should be performed and these results included in the daily entries with any amendments in the diagnosis. D. Plan of management A provisional plan of management should be recorded initially and further entries should be made as this plan is modified and/or as a patient 's condition changes and treatment is altered accordingly . Changes in procedures should be noted. E. Procedures 12 Daily recording of procedures performed should include descriptions of therapeutic procedures performed, soft tissue techniques, modalities used, exercises prescribed, nutritional supplementation , over the counter medications, or prescribed diet and activity i nstructions. Patient response to therapies , and who provided those therapies, should be noted. III. Written Reports A. History 1. Presenting complaints 2. Past medical history 3. Family health history 4. Patient's personal, social, and socio -economic history B. Examination findings C. Assessment, diagnosis , or clinical impression D. Plan of management and/or response to treatment E. Prognosis and/or outcome expectations IV. Ancillary Documentation A. Correspondence (sent and received) B. Specialty reports (diagnostic imaging, lab nerve conduction studies, etc.) C. Communications (telephone log, dialogue with specialists and/or providers co - managing case or concomitant conditions that may have effect on presenting complaint, and family or friends of the patient, etc.) 13 CHAPTER IV CHIROPRACT IC CARE AND MANAGEMENT Based upon clinical circumstances and other considerations , patient individuality may influence frequency and duration of care. Clinical judgment and decision -making may require peer review and further consultation. The following curative care algorithm presents a clinical management path for the chiropractic physician to facilitate efficient patient recovery. The emphasis is on management of the patient, not on a specific pathophysiology. Rehabilitation Rehabilitation is treatment designed to facilitate the process of recovery from injury, illness, or disease. The goal of rehabilitation is to promote recovery, improve functio n, and to help the patient become self -reliant in management of their health. This generally involves transitioning the patient from passive to active care to achieve efficient patient recovery. Pediatric patients Pediatric evaluations require age-appropriate inquiry and examination to determine treatment plans; this management may need to be modified. 14 15 The following recommendations correlate and refer to the steps in the algorithm: Box 1: History, Subjective/Objective Evaluation Chiropractors should conduct a medical history of the presenting condition and a past medical history including illnesses, hospitalizations, surgeries , and prior musculoskeletal conditions. The history should consi der red flags and psychosocial risk factors. Subjective -based outcome assessment tools (OATS) of good reliability and validity should be used at this time to establish a baseline for pain, function , and/or disability. Chiropractors should perform a physical examination appropriate to the presenting complaint(s). Procedures should be chosen according to specificity and sensitivity and have a relatively high likelihood for ruling in or out a specific condition. A physical examination should be neithe r more nor less than the presenting condition(s) require(s). Box 2: Imaging and Special Studies Chiropractors should determine the clinical necessity of additional testing that would improve their ability to accurately diagnose and/or provide treatment for the presenting condition(s). This testing can include, but is not limited to: diagnostic imaging, radiographs, laboratory, EMG, functional capacity, etc. Clinical necessity should be reflected in the records including the concerns warranting the study and how the results will influence management. Box 3: Determine Diagnosis, Stage of Condition , and any Contraindications to Care Based on history and examination, chiropractors should determine and document a diagnostic impression ex pressed in generally accepted terminology. The diagnostic impression clarifies the details of the diagnosis, including stage of condition (acute, sub -acute, repair, remodeling, chronic), and contributing and complicating factors. If any of the patien t's conditions are outside the scope of practice or clinical capacity of the specific chiropractor, or if treatment is contraindicated, then a referral to a different provider should be made and documented. Box 4: Treatment Plan Chiropractors should formu late a treatment plan appropriate to the diagnostic impression and the patient's presentation. This should include the frequency and duration of treatment, specific therapies, and goals for each. The treatment plan should not exceed 12 visits or 6 weeks before an updated evaluation for curative care (example: 3x/week for 4 weeks acute, or 2x/week for 6 weeks subacute). Proposed treatment plan(s) and prognosis should be discussed in the context of the report of findings and PARQ conference. Informed consent shall be documented. Box 5: Re-Evaluation An updated evaluation of the subjective OATS and objective/functional examination should be performed at regular intervals, or whenever clinically relevant, to determine patient progress, efficacy of care, and necessity of additional treatment. Intervals between re -evaluations 16 should not exceed 12 visits or 6 weeks, depending on the patient's current condition and treatment goals. See above examples. Box 6: Determine if Progress is Shown A compariso n of the new evaluation findings (from Box 5) to the previous evaluation findings should be performed to determine progress (OATS, functional, etc.). Patient progress should be determined by comparing previous to current findings and assessed by the physi cian for clinically meaningful change. (OATS specific, ICA and ACA guidelines, etc.) If progress is shown, go to box #7. If no improvement, go to box # 9. Box 7: Is Condition Resolved? The chiropractor should determine if the condition has resolved (subjectively, functionally, structurally, etc.). This should be goal specific . Possible endpoints of care should be when patient is at pre - injury status or maximum medical improvement (MMI ). If resolved, go to box #14. If not resolved, go to box #8. Box 8: Modify Treatment if Indicated As treatment continues, the diagnoses should be amended based on the patient's clinical presentation. If indicated, the chiropractor should modify treatment, including but not limited to: changing the frequency of visi ts, modifying modalities, updating home care instruction, etc. If appropriate, treatment frequency may be proportionately decreased to determine the patient response to daily living without care prior to the next evaluation. Box 9: Has Condition Reache d Maximum Medical Improvement or Therapeutic Benefit? If the patient is not showing progress with care, then the chiropractor should determine whether the patient has reached MMI or maximum therapeutic benefit (MTB). MMI refers to a date from which furthe r recovery or deterioration is not anticipated. MTB refers to when provided care no longer provides benefit, but other options may still exist for improvements. If MMI /MTB , then go to box #12. If not, go to box #10. Box 10: Modify Case Management If the patient is not progressing and is not considered MMI or MTB, the chiropractor should consider psychosocial factors and other treatment options. Examples of other or additional treatment options include, but are not limited to: referral t o another provider, referral for additional testing, adding or removing therapeutic modalities from the treatment plan, etc. If referral is indicated, go to box #11. To continue care, go to box #7 (may do both) . Box 11: Referral and/or Discharge See box #2 and #3 to determine appropriate referral needs. Chiropractic care may be suspended or terminated at this time, while the patient's condition may benefit from transfer of care to a different care provider. Referrals should be documented in the patient records. Box 12: Residual Findings/ Permanent Impairment When a patient's condition has reached MMI or MTB, if any residuals are still evident (subjective, functional, objective, structural, etc.) , the chiropractor should determine if a permanent impairment evaluation and/or disability rating is indicated. All residuals should be documented and discussed with the patient. Box 13: End Curative Care with Residuals. Curative care should be terminat ed after MMI or MTB has been determined and residuals (if any) are documented. The patient may be transitioned into supportive or palliative care if indicated. 17 Box 14: End Curative Care. When terminating curative care, the patient may be transitioned to supportive or wellness care, if indicated. Nothing in the existing laws or rules of the Board defines a separate standard of care for \"curative care .\" All require that the patient is entitled to an appropriate physical examination, a report of findings following the examination, including a clinical impression, and recommendations for care, followed by a PARQ, to obtain informed consent from the patient prior to rendering therapeutics. Curative Care: The term \"curative care\" refers to treatment with an intent to resolve the presenting complaint (s) without a guaranteed curative outcome. Maintenance Care: The term \"maintenance care \" is not well -defined at this time in scientific literature and is inherently vague. For purposes of this document, the OBCE will forego its use. Palliative Care: Palliative care is treatment to temporarily improve a patient' s quality of life without anticipation of overall improvement. Palliative care may be inappropriate when it interferes with other therapeutic protocols. Supportive Care: Supportive care is ongoing treatment/care for patients who have reached MTB but who may fail to sustain these benefits and may progressively deteriorate without treatment. In addition, it is intended to minimize exacerbations and degenerative sequelae. S upportive care sometimes includes the return to curative care for the waxing and waning of chronic conditions. Supportive care may be inappropriate when it interferes with other therapeutic protocols. Wellness Care: Wellness care is intended to enhanc e and optimiz e a patient's physical well -being and potentially prevent the future onset of symptoms. It is not limited to spinal manipulation but could include any element of the chiropractor's scope of practice. 18 CHAPTER V GLOSSARY OF CHIROPRACTIC MEDICAL TERMS Acute - a condition of sudden onset ; any condition with a short (<4 weeks) clinical course.

I am in privated practice and use many tools in my office, and have frequently called the Board in the past about therapies I want to add to my practice. I have my AcCP certification that I paid over $12k for, yet, I cannot dry needle. I am a doctor that is personally, professionally, and financially impacted by the Board's decisions. I would not only like to provide my input on wet cupping, but on other new procedures and technologies as well. I live and work in the Salem area, so it will be easier for me to attend required meetings regarding this matter at hand. I would like my name thrown into the hat for the adhoc committee for ETSDP, as I recently became a NBCE Chiropractic Examiner, and this is right in-line with analyzing and investigating the practice of dry cupping, which I use in private practice almost weekly, but am certainly curious as the therapeutic benefit of wet cupping, which sounds similar to bloodletting from the days of old. I have been a Oregon Licensed Chiropractor in FT practice since I opened my doors in 2007. I think my experience and expertise will provide great insight to revealing new technologies, techniques and procedures as they constantly pop up in private practice, especially with PEMF, Shock Wave, Class IV LASER, as well as Piezoelectric therapy devices, and Softwave. This committee should be formed to investigate all new technologies that we may encounter in private practice.

PO Box 1235 Lincoln City, Oregon 97367 2022 Oregon Chiropractic Board, RE: Wet Cupping Dear Healthcare Providers , I am writing to express my interest in p articing in the committee to evaluate wet cupping as an approved services for your Chiroprqctic patients Oregon. I have been a massage therapist for over 15 years. Since then, I have accumulated a broad set of skills and a love for this very personal kind of work. After being introduced to chiropractic therapies, I decided to pursue my doctorate degree in that field. And then, there came a quite unexpe cted pause. I have been using therapeutic dry cupping on my patients with great results. I believe that perform ing wet cupping would further enhance the efficacy of healing in certain cases of musculoskeletal problems . I have pursued cupping education fo r many years for my massage therapy practice. I have attended most of the available course from the International Cupping Society. They do not currently offer any guidance on wet cupping. I was introduced to wet cupping as a part of an overall training in Thai Medicine practices . It would be my privilege to be a part of developing a course of action to include wet cupping among the list of approved practices for Oreon Chiropractors.

The P&P states that initials can be added to the Dr's name if they have completed a diplomate program. Many DCs are listing NRCME after their name to indicate that they are Certified Medical Examiners in the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's National Registry of Certified Medical Examiners (NRCME). I have been doing that myself and want to always follow the Oregon regulation's for DC. Given this is a Federal Program that requires FMCSA regulated training provided by FMCSA Accredited Training Organizations and passing the NRCME test, may a DC in Oregon add \"NRCME\" to their name such as Michael Megehee, DC, NRCME? If not, would it be possible to begin an effort to allow this Federal Designation to a DC's name? Also, should I immediately remove NRCME from my name.

[2]Educational Manual for Evidence-Based Chiropractic 1 FORWARD Objective The primary objective of this patient-centered, evidence-based document is to provide an educational tool to assist chiropractic physicians and their patients in making decisions about appropriate chiropractic health care for better patient outcomes. The strength of this document is that it is patient-centered, supported by the best available evidence and not solely condition based. Further this document is profession-initiated with broad representation by Oregon licentiates in the development process. Extensive grassroots support facilitates the educational process and promotes implementation. Patient-centered, evidence-based objectives put the interest of the patient first, based on the best available evidence. Individual differences mandate that what may be good for a typical patient may not be good for the individual patient requiring flexibility in interpretation. Consensus based standards of quality derived from high level evidence, provides a basis for peer review criteria, to assist the profession in decision making based on predetermined elements of care against which aspects of individual chiropractic care can be compared. Perfect decisions about optimum care are not possible since the process of analyzing evidence and opinion is imperfect. Nevertheless the potential benefits from patient-centered, evidence-based objectives are protection of patients, reduction in practice variation, quality assurance, and improved risk management. The Status of Chiropractic Practice Guidelines in North America Interest in chiropractic practice and utilization guidelines gained momentum in the latter part of the 1980's. Prior to 1990 several states, including Ohio, Oregon and Washington, had begun guideline development. With the publicat ion of Vear's book: Chiropractic Standards of Practice and Quality of Care in 19921, some issues surrounding guidelines for chiropractic practice became formalized as standards. Beginning with the Mercy Conference Guidelines, published in 19932 practice guidelines for the chiropractic profession came into the national arena. Following directly on this publication, the politically driven Wyndham guidelines3 were published by a group of straight chiropractors dissatisfied the Mercy proceedings. The process for both sets of guidelines that were based on consensus relied heavily on the use of authoritative theory and opinion, lacking a systematic evaluation of supporting evidence. Procedure based guidelines significantly impacting the chiropractic profession have also been developed on a national level by the RAND Corporation4-5 and the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research6. Both groups evaluated supporting evidence for the use of manipulation in the treatment of acute low back pain, concluding that it is both safe and effective. These studies have been embraced enthusiastically by some chiropractors, which has gained more mainstream recognition for a limited role in which the chiropractor treats only back pain, and possibly neck pain and some forms of headache. 2 Such a limited role, however, is not consistent with the broad scope of practice in the State of Oregon. Guidelines continue to be put forth both nationally by the International Chiropractic Association (ICA)7 and the Council on Chiropractic Practice (CCP)8and at the state level9 (Florida). These documents are still largely based on consensus opinion, without the panel members reviewing the best available evidence, and far from meeting the Institute of Medicine10 criteria for guideline development. The ICA, CCP and Florida Guidelines have conflicts with the accepted practice of chiropractic in Oregon relative to diagnosis, assessment and informed consent. The CCP guidelines are designed specifically for vertebral subluxation practice, which is not inclusive or representative of the practice of chiropractic in the State Oregon. In addition some contributors and panel members listed in these guidelines did not participate directly in the consensus process. Of serious concern is the significant number of misleading references. Although found to be more acceptable, the Mercy guidelines are based primarily on consensus and have not been updated, necessitating development of a current document to guide chiropractic practice in the State of Oregon. 11 Current Status of Practice and Utilization Guidelines in Oregon The Oregon Chiropractic Practice and Utilization Guidelines were published in 199112 by the Oregon Board of Chiropractic Examiners (OBCE) in response to public demand for more accountability. Developed through consensus, these guidelines were recognized in the Northwest as one of the most advanced documents at the time. Given the more than ten years that have elapsed since these guidelines were initiated, serious questions regarding their adequacy have been raised. In response to these questions, the OBCE implementing the strategic planning process, appointed a steering committee comprised of doctors of chiropractic, representative of the various constituencies in the State of Oregon, including: Chairman Charles Simpson (OBCE representative), members John Cafferty (subluxation based chiropractor), Thomas Dobson (initiator of the current guideline process), Janet Steward, and Jack Pederson (broad scope practitioners) with Meridel Gatterman as process consultant. Dr. Gatterman has 11 years of guideline development experience including: the Oregon Practice and Utilization Guidelines,12 the Mercy Guidelines 2 and the Canadian Guidelines13 . Published works that employed a facilitated consensus process include development of chiropractic nomenclature 14, and a patient centered paradigm for both chiropractic15, and complementary medicine.16 The steering committee utilized the following four approaches to assess the status of the Oregon Chiropractic Practice and Utilization Guidelines, Volume I: survey of stakeholders; focus groups and key person interviews; expert reviews; application of the Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the National Academy of Sciences \"provisional assessment instrument\".10 The survey and focus groups responses, key person interviews, and expert reviews all identified deficiencies in the 1991 guidelines. The steering committee concluded that the 3 1991 guidelines (derived primarily through consensus of expert opinion with little documentation of evidence) are in need of revision. Inclusion of current scientific evidence coupled with broad professional consensus was designed to make the revision more accountable, credible, as well as patient centered and evidence-based. Patient Centered, Evidence-based Care Patient centered care puts the patient first, before cost cutting by managed care, doctor's egos, or financial gain. Patient centered practice evaluates the individual patient's clinical state, predicament, and preferences, and applies the most efficacious interventions to maximize the quality and quantity of life for that person17. Chiropractic practice has traditionally been patient centered with anthropological and sociological studies providing evidence and seed material for a patient centered paradigm18-20. Following evaluation of these studies combined with the philosophical first principles of chiropractic, a patient centered paradigm emerged.15. Subsequent to identification using qualitative methodology, a nominal panel comprised of chiropractic educators, researchers and practitioners validated a patient centered paradigm through a nominal consensus process. Based on this model the following characteristics of a patient centered paradigm were refined and agreed upon by the nominal consensus panel charged to assist in the development of the Oregon Practice Guidelines: 1. Recognition and facilitation of the innate organization and adaptation of the person; 2. Recognition that care should ideally focus on the total person; 3. Acknowled gment and respect for the patient's values, beliefs, expectations and health care needs; 4. Promotion of the patient's health through a preference for drugless, minimally invasive, and conservative care; 5. A proactive approach that encourages patients to takes responsibility for their health; 6. The patient and patient centered practitioner act as partners in decision making, emphasizing clinically effective and economically appropriate care, based on various levels of evidence. Evidence-based Care Evidence-based practice has been defined as: \"the conscientious explicit, and judicious use of the current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patient's \"17 Evidence-based practice means: \"integrating individual clinical expertise with t he best available external evidence from systematic research\"17. Sackett emphasizes that \"Good doctors use both individual clinical expertise, and the best available external evidence, and neither alone is enough. He notes that without clinical expertise, practice risks becoming tyrannized by evidence, because even excellent external evidence may be inapplicable or inappropriate for an individual patient. Without 4 current best evidence, practice risks rapidly becoming out of date, also to the detriment of the patient. Evidence- based practice is not \"cookbook practice.\" It is also recognized that the best available evidence is not just limited to external evidence from randomized controlled trials but also involves the individual clinicians' expertise along with the consensus of leading chiropractic clinicians and researchers based on varying degrees of patient-centered clinical research. A thorough literature review is crucial to successful evidence based practice17. The Epistemology of Scientific Knowledge Consideration of how we know what we know is based on a hierarchy of ways of knowing. This hierarchy gives us the degree of certainty that can be attributed to evidence. 1. Laws or Principles of Science Theories that have been scientifically demonstrated and are now accepted as scientific fact based on a sequence of events occurring with unvarying uniformity under the same conditions. Laws and principles explain natural actions. 2. Theories of Science A set of related ideas that have the potential to explain or predict human experience in an orderly fashion and that are based on data. Theories follow a hypothesis that has been investigated and is now in an advanced data gathering mode. Although there are many questions that still need to be answered, this category of scientific knowledge is frequently used clinically as if it were a demonstrated fact. 3. Hypothesis Hypotheses are testable statements referred to as the working tools of science. A question or conjecture is presented and tested through observation and data gathering and processing. 4. Conjecture An opinion of an expert person in a given field of science based on slight evidence. Guidelines for Grading Evidence The strength of both scientific and legal evidence is graded according to three levels. Standards of practice require higher levels of supporting evidence on which to judge competency. Due to resource limitations, evidence ratings in this document are limited to Standards. References following statements clearly indicate what evidence supports this document. Scientific Evidence The convention for grading scientific evidence is based on a hierarchy of levels that provide degrees of predictability. Type I Evidence provided by one or more well designed* randomized controlled clinical trial(s) (RCT) for therapeutic interventions or by one or more well designed descriptive studies that address sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value (for diagnostic procedures/devices). 5 Type II Evidence provided by one or more well designed observational studies, such as a case control or cohort study, or a well designed prospective case series, or clinically relevant basic science studies that address sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value . Type III Evidence provided by studies not meeting the criteria of Type I or II, that may include expert opinion, field practitioner consensus, or other sources, as judged by an Expert Panel. * For the purpose of this document, \"well designed\" refers to a study that has, at a minimum, relatively high internal validity (low systematic error) and sufficient precision for statistical significance (adequate study numbers) Legal Evidence Legal evidence is also based on a hierarchy of supporting evidence ranging from statutes which are mandatory to legal opinion that is discretionary. Legal Type I This administrative aspect of practice is mandated by ORS or OAR, or is found to be essential and is necessary (A standard of practice). Legal Type II This administrative aspect of practice is supported by uncontrolled studies and/or published legal opinion and is recommended, and in some cases mandatory. (Official AG opinion vs., \"legal opinion\" written in a legal peer review journal vs. \"case law\" opinion) Legal Type III This administrative aspect of practice is supported by a consensus of practitioners as determined by the Expert Panel or by expert legal opinion and is discretionary. A Three Tiered Evidence-based Consensus Process The process used to develop the following chapters involves three levels of consensus. Each chapter is developed first through a seed statement from a seed panel composed of 5-7 panel members that review the best available evidence. Seed statements are then reviewed by a 9-15 member nominal panel that reviews all chapters for consistency, continuity and to minimize redundancy. The final review is by a 100-member Delphi panel that reviews one or all chapters and participates in the consensus process by mail. Panel Selection Selection of panel members is made by the Steering Committee based on the following criteria: A. Geographical representation 6 B. Philosophical representation C. Gender representation D. Practice experience representation Where possible a balance of each population identified will be included. To facilitate frequent meetings balanced geographical representation is not always possible at the seed panel level. Challenges to the Consensus Process Challenges to the consensus process have included lack of differentiation between guidelines and standards, political opposition to guideline development, limited resources, and a scarcity of quality evidence. Standards versus Guidelines Despite peer reviewed publication of a paper by two steering committee members and one nominal panel member that differentiated between guidelines and standards21, there remains the perception by many that guidelines are synonymous with standards. This in part is due to the inappropriate use of guidelines as absolute standards by third party payers and attorneys. While this utilization of guidelines is not consistent with the defined use of these terms in the literature, the process has been hampered by the fear that development of guidelines will lead to misuse. Guidelines are considered to be recommendations that allow for flexibility and individual patient differences. Standards are more binding and require a high level of supporting evidence. While guidelines serve as educational tools to improve the quality of practice, standards that outline minimum competency are used more as administrative tools on which to base policy. Confusion generated by poor differentiation of guidelines from standards therefore contributes to mistrust of the guideline process. Because of this challenge the updated Oregon Practice and Utilization Guidelines document is referred to as a Manual for Evidence Based Chiropractic Practice. Where applicable, standards are clearly stated. Political Opposition Opposition to updating the Oregon practice and utilization guidelines by representatives of one political organization is an ongoing challenge to the process. A concerted attempt by members of the steering committee, the OBCE and members of the profession to engage these individuals in continued participation in the process has been made, emphasizing that the way to ensure that the process is inclusive is to participate. Various claims regarding lack of inclusion of evidence or changes in seed statements as they proceeded through the process could have been easily addressed and resolved if these individuals would have communicated their concerns in a timely manner and continued their participation. At all times the process has worked to improve seed statements as they achieved consensus through the seed panel, nominal panel and Delphi process. 7 Resources A challenge to the current process is the lack of adequate resources to fully support an ambitious effort. A grant application for outside funding was not successful and a request for additional funding from the OBCE was not approved by the 2001 Legislative Session. This prevented contracting with a project manager as planned, contributing to slower progress. However, the process has proceeded with strong support from numerous Oregon chiropractors who have contributed their time and energy to review evidence, draft seed statements, and attend meetings or review drafts sent to them by mail. The OBCE has supported this effort by providing meeting space, mailings, and printing services within its current budget. Lack and Quality of Evidence The greatest challenge to evidence-based practice is the lack of evidence. This is true of all health care professions.22 This has been especially acute for the chiropractic profession that has long been denied external funding. It is only in the recent past that significant federal funding has been applied to the study of chiropractic. This has created a problem of legitimization in which the science of chiropractic has been evaluated through the lens of the medical paradigm. Paradigm A paradigm is a socially constructed disciplinary matrix, grounded on habits of mind and webs of belief.23 It is characterized by symbolic generalizations, shared models and shared values. It includes concepts, perceptions, and techniques shared by a scientific community and used by that community to define legitimate problems and legitimate solutions.23 A paradigm is useful as both a plan of action and a lens through which the chiropractor views the patient. The chiropractor is thus provided with a worldview through which the science of chiropractic can advance, in the patient's interest.15 The Chiropractic Paradigm The Association of Chiropractic Colleges (ACC)24 agreed to the following chiropractic paradigm that has subsequently been adopted by the World Federation of Chiropractic: The purpose of chiropractic is to optimize the patient's health. This is based on the principle that the body's innate recuperative power is affected by and integrated through the nervous system. The practice of chiropractic within the chiropractic paradigm includes: establishing a diagnosis; facilitating the body's homeostasis through emphasis on neurological and biomechanical integrity, and promoting health. 8 The Chiropractic Foundation The foundation of chiropractic includes philosophy, science, art, knowledge, and clinical experience. The chiropractic paradigm directly influences the following: patient health through quality care; education; research; health care policy and leadership; relationships with other health care providers; professional stature; public awareness and perceptions The Subluxation Chiropractic is concerned with the preservation and restoration of health, and focuses particular attention on subluxation. A subluxation is a complex of functional and/or structural and/or pathological articular changes that compromise neural integrity and may influence organ system function and general health. A subluxation is evaluated, diagnosed, and managed through the use of chiropractic procedures based on the best available rational and empirical evidence. Chiropractic Scope of Practice Members of the Association of Chiropractic Colleges educate students for the competent practice of chiropractic. These accredited academic institutions have defined the scope of chiropractic practice within the chiropractic paradigm. Since human function is neurologically integrated Doctors of Chiropractic evaluate and facilitate biomechanical and neuro-biological functions and integrity through the use of appropriate conservative, and diagnostic and chiropractic care procedures. Therefore, direct access to chiropractic care is integral to everyone's health care regimen. Chiropractic Practice A. Diagnosis Doctors of Chiropractic, as primary contact health care providers, employ the education, knowledge, diagnostic skill and clinical judgment necessary to determine appropriate chiropractic care and case management. Doctors of Chiropractic have access to diagnostic procedures and/or referral resources as required. B. Case Management Doctors of chiropractic establish a doctor/patient relationship and utilize adjustive and other clinical procedures unique to the chiropractic discipline. Doctors of Chiropractic may also use other conservative patient care procedures, and when appropriate, collaborate with and/ or refer to other health care providers. C. Health Promotion Doctors of Chiropractic advise and educate patients and communities in structural and spinal hygiene and healthful living practices24. 9 Chiropractic Nomenclature Developed through Consensu s Chiropractic nomenclature has been developed through agreement obtained by a rigorous process using both nominal and Delphi consensus methods14. Moving through increasingly complex stages agreement was reached on the following ten terms used to discuss chiropractic science.: Articular functional units. Motion segment-A functional unit made up of the two adjacent articulating surfaces and the connecting tissues binding then to each other. Spinal motion segment- Two adjacent vertebrae, and the connecting tissues binding then to each other. The lesion treated by chiropractors . Subluxation-A motion segment, in which alignment, movement integrity and/or physiological function are altered although contact between joint surfaces remains intact. Manipulable (chiropractic) subluxation-A subluxation in which alignment, movement integrity and/or function can be improved by manual thrust procedures. Subluxation complex-A theoretical model of motion segment dysfunction (subluxation) which incorporates the complex interaction of pathological changes in nerve, muscle, ligamentous, vascular and connective tissues. Subluxation syndrome-An aggregate of signs and symptoms that relate to pathophysiology or dysfunction of motion segments. Treatment procedures utilized by chiropractors. Adjustment-Any chiropractic therapeutic procedure that utilizes controlled force, leverage, direction, amplitude, and velocity which is directed at specific joints or anatomical regions. Chiropractors commonly use such procedures to influence joint and neurophysiological function. Manual therapy-Procedures by which the hands directly contact the body to treat the articulations and/or soft tissues. Manipulation-A manual procedure that involves a directed thrust to move a joint past the physiological range of motion, without exceeding the anatomical limit Mobilization-Movement applied singularly or repetitively within or at the physiological range of joint movement, without imparting a thrust or impulse, with the goal of restoring joint mobility. Introduction to the Philosophy, Science and Art of Chiropractic The Traditional Philosophy of Chiropractic The traditional vitalistic philosophy of chiropractic is based on the scientific philosophy of biology that features the functional organization of living beings.25 Living beings are capable of maintaining their overall organization in the face of extensive variations in their environment.25 Similar organization does not occur in the non-living world25. 10 According to D.D. Palmer, the founder of chiropractic, the vital functioning of each individual is directed by the body's innate intelligence, and expression of universal intelligence.26 Universal intelligence accounts for the universal regularities and laws of nature that are the concern of physics and chemistry, and the particular regularities and laws of physiology 27. That those processes of bodily functioning whereby the body is regulated through electrophysiological, biochemical , immunological, and other mechanisms, forms the basis of the science of physiology. Palmer's concept of \"innate intelligence\", the ability of the body to regulate and repair itself, is also referred to as homeostasis.28 The philosophy of chiropractic is based on the belief that the true locus of health comes from within through modulation by the nervous system. Recognition of the role of the nervous system in health and disease has increased in the last decade. Recent evidence that supports Palmer's traditional concept is exemplified by the emerg ing focus on neuroimmunology which provides evidence in support of a strong relationship between nervous system and immunological function29. The philosophy of chiropractic is both vitalistic and holistic30. Chiropractic holistic philosophy views the patient as an whole person, not as a disease bearing organism. The body is seen as an integral unit capable of maintaining health. The systems of the body are viewed as complex, interactive, and have a powerful ability to self-correct provided functional integrity is maintained. The holistic philosophy of chiropractic promotes health, prevents illness, and encourages healing through care that focuses on the total individual in the context of personal, familial, social, and environmental factors. Holism with respect to humans recognizes that the whole has properties that its parts lack and the properties of the parts interact to form the whole25 Perceiving the whole is more difficult than the parts. It often requires subdividing the whole looking for connections and the interaction of the parts in the context of the whole. In the historical perspective of chiropractic philosophy there is an important interrelationship between optimal nerve function, the integrity of the musculosketetal system, and health. The Science of Chiropractic Traditionally, the science of chiropractic has focused on the modulating function of the nervous system in the self healing of the human organism, and the role that interference with the nervous system has on the loss of optimal health. While this is fundamental to chiropractic principles the most compelling scientific evidence to date supports chiropractic treatment of neuromusculoskeletal conditions. In the more than one hundred years that chiropractic has been in existence, much of the significant and reproducible research has been compressed within the past two decades. The past five years has been particularly significant with the evidence supporting the primary chiropractic intervention (manipulation) as one of the first-line means of health care intervention in the treatment of acute low back pain in adults. The science of 11 chiropractic comes from basic science evidence, case studies, clinical trials, and other outcome studies. In 1975 the NINCDS (National Institute of Neurological, Circulatory, Disorders and Stroke) conference 31 found that \"specific conclusions cannot be derived from the scientific literature for or against either the efficacy of spinal manipulative therapy or the pathophysiological functions fro m which it is derived\". Given the impetus of this conference, considerable research has been conducted demonstrating the safety and efficacy of this procedure. In spite of the paucity of funds, (up to 1994 coming solely from the profession itself), chiropractic researchers have made steady gains. With external funding, future gains promise to add significant data to support the uniqueness of chiropractic theories and to sustain evidence-based practice. Basic science studies have been primarily been designed to test theories related to one piece of the core of chiropractic practice, the chiropractic spinal subluxation. Where the spinal subluxation seen by allopathic (medical) practitioners is viewed radiographically and frequently demonstrates hypermobility , the chiropractic subluxation typically exhibits restricted motion, along with misalignment and altered neurological function5. Anatomical studies related to subluxation have primarily investigated the components of the spinal motion segments including the zygapophyseal joints32-33structures surrounding the intervertebral foramen34-39, and the sacro-iliac joints40. Basic scientific evidence for chiropractic subluxation has also been demonstrated in 16 studies of animal models41. Studies in the field of neuroscience have included investigation of the innervation of components of the spinal motion segment42,43, spinal nerve roots44 peripheral nerves45 and the autonomic nervous system46-49. Studies of systemic effects of spinal manipulation through nervous system modulation include changes in immune function50,51.. Neurophysiological investigations into pain modulation include, spinal cord mechanisms of referred pain and neurologically linked physiological aberrations52-54. Numerous biomechanical studies related to subluxation and manipulation have been conducted advancing the science of chiropractic. A major area of chiropractic research has focused on the characterization of the forces applied to the surface of the patient during various adjustive procedures55-60, others investigators have evaluated loads and displacements used to measure the mechanics of spinal segments61-68. The mechanical effects of cavitation and the audible release accompanying high velocity low amplitude thrust procedures have also been studied69-73. These investigations, primarily conducted by chiropractors are but a small part of basic science research that validates chiropractic theories. Studies conducted by basic scientists in other related fields have provided considerable support beyond the studies mentioned here. Knowledge gained by basic science models has yielded information on subluxation not available by measurements on living humans. 12 The most compelling evidence for chiropractic care comes from clinical trials that evaluate the effectiveness spinal manipulation for neuromusculoskeletal conditions. Over 40 clinical trials of spinal manipulation for the treatment of low back pain have been conducted. These have been subjected to evaluation of methodological quality74 and meta-analysis75. This has led to acceptance of manipulation as a viable alternative to allopathic care in the treatment of acute low back pain. Chronic low back pain while subjected to less scrutiny, has also demonstrated significant response to chiropractic manipulation76,77. Evidence from clinical trials also supports the treatment of neck pain with manipulation78-80. Benefit from cervical manipulation has also been demonstrated from headache trials studying tension81-83, migraine84,856 and cervicogenic types86-88. Non musculoskeletal conditions for which clinical trials of varying rigor supporting chiropractic intervention include obstetric and gynecologic disorders (such as dysmenorrhea and media96,97, and hyperactivity98) . Trails of chiropractic care of other conditions have demonstrated mixed results. Hypertension studies involving adults demonstrated both short-lived reductions 99,100 and no significant alteration101 in blood pressure readings. Studies of children with eneuresis have demonstrated both the effectiveness of chiropractic treatment102 and no efficacy beyond the natural history of the condition103. Asthma trials studying both children and adults have shown positive results104-,106, no significant improvement107, and both no benefit108, and a significant decrease in nighttime symptoms109 , in the same study. In addition to the clinical trials previously mentioned, a variety of methods have been used for outcomes research including community based trials, observational studies and cross sectional surveys all of which provide supporting data. Among the community based trials the Meade studies reported greater effectiveness of chiropractic care for low back pain compared to hospital-based physical therapy110,111. Observational studies of chiropractic care designed to assess patient outcomes for low back pain have been reported112-118. Cross -sectional studies of chiropractic have evaluated care-seeking for acute and chronic low back pain110,111 . Physicians' beliefs and behaviors regarding management of low back pain119and patient's satisfaction with the care provided have also been studied120,121. A preliminary study suggests that geriatric patients under chiropractic care are more apt to report better health status, more likely to exercise vigorously, and more likely to be mobile in the community122. This discussion has not included many of the cohort studies, case series or case reports that document the effectiveness of chiropractic care. There is evidence from these types of studies also contributes to chiropractic science. In addition these studies provide clues as to the direction of future chiropractic research. Agendas for prioritizing future research related to chiropractic theories and practice are conducted nationally on an annual basis123, and internationally on a biannual basis 124. Regular research conferences that present the results of chiropractic are held world wide including those sponsored by the Foundation for Chiropractic Education and Research ( The International Conference on Spinal Manipulation), and the World Federation of Chiropractic. 13 There is little doubt that evidence from clinical trials clearly supports the treatment of low back pain by chiropractors125. Evidence for the treatment of neck pain126 and headaches81- 88 is also convincing. Although both clinical experience and expert opinion in the chiropractic, osteopathic, and medical literature 127-131 suggest an observable link between manipulation and improvement in at least some non-musculoskeletal conditions clinical trails lag far behind actual practice. To date at least 73 randomized clinical trials of a broadly defined spinal manipulative procedure have been reported in the English language literature. No trial to date has found manipulation to be statistically or clinically less effective than the comparison treatment.132 Causation related to subluxation remains to be demonstrated. It is imperative to remember that lack of evidence does not constitute evidence against, while further research accumulates in the field of chiropractic science. The Clinical Art of Chiropractic Chiropractic practice is fundamentally patient centered and pragmatic, based on empirical results. This patient centered orientation as opposed to an illness orientation has traditionally been central to the clinical art of chiropractic133. Coulehan134 states that chiropractors do not subtract the patient to get to the disease as if peering through a translucent screen to find a disease entity within. He also states that the application of this clinical art is a matrix of acceptance, validation, explanation and treatment . The sense of acceptance or positive regard for a patient is considered one of the core qualities necessary for patient-doctor interaction134. Validation includes acknowledging the patient's perceptions, values, health care preferences and expectations. Genuineness both as the ability to be oneself in a relationship without hiding behind a role or facade134, and genuine caring 135 have also been noted as prominent in chiropractic care. Chiropractic art includes a clear and understandable explanation of the patients condition134. This explanatory model is mechanistic, holistic and based on science. Additionally, it is based on a logical set of beliefs presented in scientific terminology, promoting a natural noninvasive approach to healing135. It includes stressing influences on health, \"drugless\" tr eatment and a positive, dynamic view of the healthy state135. Patients are encouraged to take responsibility for their health and enter into a partnership in decision making 15. Chiropractors strive to develop a positive image of patients' personal cont rol over their health that requires commitment and cooperation135. Primary to the chiropractic explanatory model is the emphasis that the chiropractic adjustment facilitates a change in physiology which can translate into improved health. Traditiona l chiropractic thought explains this phenomenon as the body's innate capacity for healing. Additionally chiropractic art includes enhancing patients' focus on their health. Current understanding of biopsychosocial factors explains how the chiropractor strengthens patients' belief that they will recover and is considered to be included in the chiropractic clinical art 135. Chiropractors seek to create conditions in their patients that 14 are conducive to the liberation of patient's innate recuperative capa cities, thus enabling them to return to their optimal state of health15. Chiropractic treatment is characterized by advanced skill in manual procedures. The level of skill necessary to perform a successful adjustment requires years of training in the art of palpation and adjusting. Both the chiropractic examination and treatment involves extensive \"laying on of the hands\"135. Mastery of chiropractic technique procedures utilizes the healing power of touch, adding comfort to the clinical action of the treatment. Beyond the skills of patient evaluation and diagnostic testing germane to portal of entry providers, much of the art of chiropractic involves the location and correction of subluxation. This includes the skill at analysis used to locate the subluxation, the specific adjustive technique used to reduce or correct the subluxation, and the assessment used to determine the type of future care. Chiropractic adjustive procedures are specific and include high velocity low amplitude thrust techniques (manipulation), mechanically assisted techniques, light touch techniques, soft tissue techniques and reflex procedures 136. 15 REFERENCES 1.

The helping relationship is founded on: empathy, congruence, genuineness, respect, positive regard, caring and concern for the other.1 Chiropractors offer a patient centered form of clinical care that exhibits these characteristics.2-4 The partnership arrangement, also characteristic of patient centered care, demands a sharing of power and control between the patient and doctor.1 The resulting alliance enhances patients' sense of control over themselves. Tools for refining patient centered care in the chiropractic consultation can influence the locus of control in the patient- chiropractor relationship and enhance the patient's sense of congruency.5 The shift to patient centered care is reflected in the current trend in terminology, referring to the patient -doctor relationship instead of the doctor-patient relationship. 1, 6-9 Studies have found significantly greater patient satisfaction with chiropractic care over other practitioners treating similar conditions.2, 10, 11 The patient-doctor relationship plays an important part in patient satisfaction.1 Section 2 PATIENT'S RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES Awareness of patients' rights has been heightened with the rise in health care consumerism.1, 12 An increase in patient participation in the patient-doctor encounter has evened the power relationship with patients demanding the right to become more involved in their own health care decisions.1, 12 This has led to more patient autonomy, a more egalitarian relationship, and active participation by patients in making decisions about their health care. The conventional model where the doctor \"always knows best\" no longer goes unchallenged.1 Relinquishing power to patients includes acknowledging a patient's bill of rights. Patient's Bill of Rights A patient and/or his/her legal representative has the right to: receive informed consent regarding procedures, risks and alternatives, and receive answers to questions with respect to treatment; 13-15 refuse treatment and accept the potential consequences of that choice after thorough explanation; 13,15 expect reasonable safety insofar as the health care environment is concerned; 15 be interviewed and examined in surroundings that permit reasonable visual and auditory privacy; 13-15 have another person present during examination and/or treatment; 15 expect that all communications and records pertaining to their care should be treated as confidential; 13-15 receive complete, current information concerning diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis in terms reasonably understood; 13-15 know the identity and professional status of the individual providing service to them and know who has the primary responsibility for coordinating their care; 13-15 expect reasonable continuity of care; 13,15 be fully advised of and accept or refuse to participate in any research project and/or O.B.C.E. approved investigational procedure(s); 13,15 receive and examine an explanation of charges for services rendered; 13,15 receive considerate and respectful care; 13,14 expect not to be denied treatment solely on the basis of race, color, religion or sexual preference. 15 Patient's Responsibilities A patient and/or his/her legal representative has the responsibility to: be honest and forthright with the doctor and office staff and to provide accurate and complete information about present complaints, past illnesses, accidents, hospitalizations, medications and any other information related to his/her health; 14,15 report to the doctor in a timely manner any new incident, trauma or changes in his/her health condition; 15* acknowledge and consider instructions provided by the doctor and/or office staff; 14* request clarification about any aspect of his/her care not fully comprehended; 14,15* keep scheduled appointments or give adequate notice of delay or cancellation; 14* treat doctors and office staff with respect and courtesy.14 * Considering the above items, lack of cooperation may cause endangerment to the patient's health and/or impaired results of care. Chiropractors have the right to select their cases and patients. It is permissible for the doctor to discontinue treatment of a patient when the patient fails to cooperate in an agreed upon plan of management. 16 Section 3 INFORMED CONSENT Informed consent is the issue pertaining to a patient's right to make a decision about treatment based on adequate foreknowledge or understanding of that treatment and its anticipated outcome.17-24 It is the process of giving patients information needed to make educated decisions concerning their treatment.17,19, 25,26 Informed consent serves as an opening for dialogue with the patients and involves them in their care.27 It is the process of effectively communicating with patients in terms they understand, allowing them the opportunity to ask questions. One of the goals of these guidelines is to inform practitioners about the ethical issues and legal precedents within which they must work. The basic principle of consent is that competent persons have the right to choose what will be done to them. It is the responsibility of the physician to inform the patient, in non-technical terms, of anticipated practices and procedures and to receive the patient's informed consent prior to examination and therapy procedures.19 When applicable, the physician should also explain reasonable alternative treatments.19, 26 Informed consent can be viewed as an opportunity to establish trust and rapport and to collaborate with patients in the decision-making process. Through informed consent, the chiropractor can strengthen a person's commitment to treatment by promoting understanding of what can be accomplished.25 Informed consent is an important risk management tool.23 By adding the element of trust and respect for the patient, an atmosphere of joint decision making is created. It gives the practitioner a chance to educate patients about the value of chiropractic and how it may benefit them. To gain informed consent, Oregon health care practitioners are required to utilize a Procedures, Alternatives, Risks and Questions (PARQ) Conference.28 In this PARQ conference the physician shall explain the following: (a) in general terms the procedure or treatment to be undertaken; (b) that there may be alternative procedures or methods of treatment; and (c) that there are risks, if any, to the procedure or treatment. After giving the explanation specified above, the physician shall ask the patient if the patient wants a more detailed explanation. If the patient requests further explanation, the physician shall disclose to the patient in substantial detail the procedure, the viable alternatives, and the material risks, unless to do so would be materially detrimental. In determining that further explanation woul d be materially detrimental, the physician shall give due consideration to the standards of practice of reasonable chiropractic practitioners in the same or a similar community under the same or similar circumstances.28 The essence of informed consent is communication between the patient and doctor, whether written or oral.29 This responsibility should be seen as an ethical, as well as a legal, obligation.26 Therefore, patient-doctor discussion is the key . 12,19-21, 30,31- 33 The doctor must be prepared to expand the explanation, if necessary, and the information should be tailored to the patient and the procedure or treatment. Suggestions for Documenting Informed Consent Most authorities recommend that informed consent be documented.20, 22, 23,34,35 The following methods are offered as options for charting informed consent. However, the practitioner is not limited to these specific suggestions. 1. Patients can be given standardized forms17,26,36 which they sign. However, practitioners should not rely exclusively on those forms and must communicate directly with the patients.29, 34 The use of a written consent form is at the discretion of the individual practitioner in the State of Oregon. 16,28 If a written form is used, it must be signed by the patients and included in their record.34 2. The acronym PARQ can be written in the patient's chart indicating that the physician has explained the procedures ( P), viable alternatives ( A), material risks ( R), if any, and asked if the patient has any questions ( Q). If the patient requests further information, the physician can underline the PARQ chart notation to reflect the patient's request and that the physician provided more detailed information.37 It is important to note that consent to have one physician perform a procedure is not consent for any other physician unless the patient agrees to substitute care. The practitioner may make a written entry into the patient's record, or, if a written form is used, the practitioner may wish to include a sentence to address this issue. There are situations in which the method for obtaining informed consent may need to be modified. For example, each parent of minor children (under 18) has the authority and responsibility to consent to health care for his/her minor children unable to consent for themselves. If the parents are divorced, the noncustodial parent may authorize the physician's treatment in the absence of the custodial parent. In the case of minor parents who cannot consent for either their own care or that of their children, consent must come from a third party such as a parent, grandparent or legal guardian. Section 4 DISCLOSURE AND CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS \"The chiropractic physician shall preserve a patient's medical records from disclosure and will release them only on a patient's written consent stating to whom the records are being released or as required by State or Federal law\".38 Confidentiality is an ethical and legal responsibility and is also necessary if practitioners expect individuals to be straightforward and honest. Patients must be confident that information will remain private and secure from public scrutiny. This confidence forms the basis for the principle that all patient-doctor communications are privileged and confidential.19,39- 43 Practitioners must not disclose whether an individual is, or has been, a patient. This includes disclosing information to the immediate family of the patient, with the exception of a parent or guardian of a minor or person legally declared incompetent.19 The practitioner is responsible for observing professional and legal requirements of confidentiality, as well as ensuring these requirements are met by any employee involved in the preparation, organization, filing or other handling of patient records.39 Ultimately, patients have the right to have any information pertaining to their health kept confidential and not made available to others without authorization.19,38-45 This information remains privileged even after the patient dies.19, 41, 43 Even though an individual pays for professional services, they do not own the resulting records.19 With few exceptions, e.g. federally assisted drug or alcohol abuse programs, patients have the right to copy,41,42 inspect,41,42 correct, amend, authorize or restrict access,19,40- 42 be notified of intended disclosures 19,40- 42 and pursue breach of duty remedies with respect to their personal health records.42 There are few exceptions to the rules of disclosure. However, the following situations allow disclosure without permission of the patient: response to certain court orders; conformity with statutory reporting law, e.g. child,45 elderly abuse; communicable disease reporting, e.g. TB; injuries allegedly resulting from a criminal act, e.g. knife or gunshot wounds; cases where an individual threatens harm to themselves and/or others with a reasonable probability they will carry out the threat.40-43 In the cases of communicable disease where the patient refuses to inform or allow someone else to inform an endangered third party, or when there is a threat of physical violence where a third party may be in danger, the duty for disclosure to both public officials and the third party may exist.41, 42 The State of Oregon has developed a statute encouraging health care providers to adopt voluntary guidelines that will give health care recipients access to their medical records in addition to preserving them from unnecessary disclosure. This statute recommends utilizing a written release authorization form. (See Appendix A) If, in the professional judgement of a physician, disclosure of a medical record or part of a record would be injurious to a patient, the provider may withhold that record or provide an accurate and representative summary of the information contained in the record. In addition, a health care provider may withhold another provider's record in their possession even after receiving a written release authorization. In either of these situations, the health care provider must disclose the author and date of the withheld record(s) and/or summary(s), or declare the record provided to be a summary. \"A patient may not maintain an action for damages against a health care provider for disclosures made by the health care provider in good faith reliance on a properly executed written release authorization...\" 44 With respect to workers' compensation claims, signed forms 801, 827, 829, and 2837 (Release of Information) give medical providers the authority and responsibility to release relevant medical records to the insurer, the insurer's representative, or the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services.46 In order to protect the patient's right to privacy, the health care provider must have further specific consent for admitting a non-essential person (e.g. student intern) where privacy may be compromised or when taking pictures for clinical or professional purposes. Like other forms of consent, this should be documented. 19 If information is going to be electronically transferred, a confidentiality statement should be utilized as a cover sheet to preserve confidentiality. 40, 41, 45 For example, PLEASE NOTE: The information contained in this transmission is confidential in nature. The information is to be used for its intended purpose only and is to be destroyed after the stated need has been fulfilled. Please deliver IMMEDIATELY to the individual indicated above. If you have received the transmission in error, please notify us immediately by telephone and destroy the transmitted documents. The health care provider may even want to include in their release of record document a check box that gives the patient the choice to not have their records transmitted electronically as the confidentiality of these systems is somewhat less reliable. The healthcare provider should maintain records of any electronic transmissions and request the receiver to sign and return attached receipts when the data has been received. 40, 45 The increasing reliance on electronic storage and transmission of health record data requires that the provider take all reasonable precautions to ensure that confidentiality is maintained. 41- 43 It is the patients' responsibility to be aware of their insurance company's policy with respect to releasing medical records; i.e. who is allowed access to their private health records. In order for the healthcare provider to submit a standard health insurance claim form to an insurance carrier, the patient must \"...authorize the release of any medical or other information nece ssary to process this claim.\" 47 Other areas may compromise confidentiality including sign-in sheets, patient files, door/wall hanging file holders, \"thank you for referral\" cards, etc. Health care providers should establish policies and procedures that ensure reasonable protection of the patients' right to confidentiality in addition to acting as role models by demonstrating their commitment to patient privacy and confidentiality. 40, 41, 43,45 Section 5 DOMESTIC VIOLENCE Domestic violence is one of the major, serious public health problems affecting families in America and globally.48-51 Domestic violence, child abuse and elder abuse are all included in the broader category of family violence.49 Most definitions of domestic violence (a.k.a. intimate partner abuse (IPA), intimate partner violence (IPV)) include the following components: 1. ongoing pattern of intentional violent or assaultive or coercive behaviors or tactics. 48, 51- 58 2. purposeful tactics or behaviors directed at achieving and maintaining power, compliance or control over the victim, 51,52,57 thereby denying their individual and civil rights.56 3. may include any or all of the following: Physical abuse: 48-57 injuries of a non-accidental or unexplained nature including shaking, slapping, hitting, kicking, punching, choking, biting, throwing, use of conventional and household objects as weapons;52 injuries commonly targeted to proximal areas so they remain concealed; 52 denial of medical attention, physical needs (food, water, shelter, sleep), access or use of contraceptives or other safe sex techniques; 52 restraint or not allowing victim to leave their room or home; 52 murder. 52,54- 57 Sexual abuse: 48-53,56,57 rape; 52 making sexual jokes or comments intended to humiliate or demean; 52 forcing any person to watch pornography or others having sexual contact, or participating in prostitution or pornography. 52 Emotional or psychological abuse: 48,50-54,57 social isolation or deprivation; 48, 52, 53, 57 verbal abuse or intimidation and threats; 48,52,53,56,57 control by isolation from family and friends; 52-54,57 techniques of coercion or brainwashing designed to use children against a partner; e.g. threatening to take or hurt the children, using children to continue contact through custody or visitation. 52 Economic coercion or control: 48,51,52,54,57 in any type of relationship: adult, adolescent, current heterosexual, homosexual including former dating, marriage, and cohabitating. 48,52,53,58 Domestic violence is a gender- neutral term and universal problem, which cuts across all racial, socioeconomic, national, religious and ethnic boundaries.48,49, 54,57 The overwhelming majority of victims, 90-95%, are women; 48,49,57 however, expert opinion and initial studies suggest domestic violence among lesbians gay, bisexual and transgender individuals may be comparable to domestic violence perpetrated against heterosexual women.53 There is no standardization of what constitutes a violent act. This results in conflicting estimates of the number of women and men affected by \"violence54.\" There is paucity of data about domestic violence against men. Statistics The following statistics help to illustrate the pervasiveness of violence against women: estimates of incidents of violence to women range from 1-12 million/year48 but the most commonly reported incidence rate is 2-4 million/year; 48,51, 54,57 prevalence ranges from 20-54% of women experiencing violence in a relationship or lifetime; 48,52-54,56,57 battering is the single greatest cause of injury to women; 48 30-75% of women killed in the U.S. are murdered by a domestic partner; 48,55 1 in 10 women are in a violent relationship at any given time; 48 75% of spousal assaults occur at the time of separation or divorce; 55 violence tends to be repetitive and averages six violent episodes/year; 49 4-24% of pregnant women are physically assaulted; 48, 51, 53, 57 abuse of women and children occurs concurrently an estimated 30-70% of the time; 54,57 While these statistics are useful to illustrate the magnitude of the problem, they are only estimates. Many cases of domestic violence are unreported or undetected so the true incidence is unknown. 48-50,54 The toll of domestic violence is enormous.49,51 It is estimated that 1.8 billion dollars per year are spent directly on health care for victims.51 In addition to the healthcare cost, there is a high societal cost.49 Boys who are reared in violent homes have an increased risk of becoming abusers51 and girls who witness or experience violence have an increased risk of becoming victims.48,51 Children who live in violent homes have higher rates of learning difficulties, decreased academic performance, increased behavioral problems and are more likely to be violent adults.57 Chiropractors have the opportunity to play an important role in shaping societal values by naming the disease, domestic violence.56 This is a primary responsibility and may allow the survivor to begin seeing his/her situation differently, giving them the opportunity to start taking control of their lives.56 The public may come to understand that domestic violence is unacceptable behavior when physicians make it clear that it's important to ask whether an intimate or formerly intimate partner caused injuries.56 If the root cause of an incomplete diagnosis, prescription for medication, recurrence of injury, or stress related injuries is domestic violence, the practitioner has the opportunity to protect the patient from escalating risk by addressing this issue.56 If the practitioner recognizes and helps a victim with \"minor\" signs or symptoms of domestic violence, a serious or even fatal episode could be prevented.56 For practice tips for identifying and treating the abused patient see Appendix B Section 6 CHILD AND ELDER ABUSE Child Abuse Child abuse and neglect is a problem59-61 of \"epidemic proportions\"62 that affected approximately 20,000 Oregon children in 1997 and 1998.62 The victim of child abuse is an unmarried person, under the age of 18, who has been non -accidentally physically or mentally injured, negligently treated or maltreated, sexually abused or exploited, or who dies as a result of abuse or neglect.62 Chiropractors observe and treat children on a regular basis. A chiropractor, having reasonable cause to believe any child with whom the chiropractor comes in contact has suffered abuse or any person with whom the chiropractor comes in contact has abused a child, is required by Oregon Law63 to report64 orally \"by telephone or otherwise to the local office of the State Office for Services to Children and Families (SCF), to the designee of the State Office for Services to Children and Families or to a law enforcement agency within the county where the person making the report is located at the time of the contact.\" Any report made is subject to confidentiality65 and the person making the report may not be sued for making a report in good faith66. Abuse can be classified into four basic categories: 62 physical abuse; neglect; mental injury or emotional maltreatment; sexual abuse. ORS 419B.005 defines child abuse as: \"Any assault, as defined in ORS chapter 163, of a child and any physical injury to a child which has been caused by other than accidental means, including any injury which appears to be at variance with the explanation given of the injury.\" This does not include reasonable discipline unless the discipline results in assault or any of the following conditions: \"Any mental injury to a child, which shall include only observable and substantia l impairment of the child's mental or psychological ability to function caused by cruelty to the child, with due regard to the culture of the child; \"Rape of a child, which includes but is not limited to rape, sodomy, unlawful sexual penetration and incest, as those acts are defined in ORS chapter 163; \"Sexual abuse, as defined by ORS chapter 163; \"Sexual exploitation;67 \"Negligent treatment or maltreatment of a child, including but not limited to the failure to provide adequate food, clothing, shelter or medical care that is likely to endanger the health or welfare of the child; \"Threatened harm to a child, which means subjecting a child to a substantial risk of harm to the child's health or welfare; \"Buying or selling a person under 18 years of age as described in ORS 163.537.\" Elder Abuse (persons 65-years of age or older) Abuse in its various forms affects our society from children to the elderly. It is estimated that approximately 2.5 million older people are abused each year; however, only about 10% of the cases are reported. Elderly victims of abuse \"often have low self-esteem, blame themselves for the abuse, and do not want to admit their vulnerabilities or betray their families,\" and are usually abused by those with whom they live.68 Neglect of, or ridicule toward, an elderly person can frequently be an indicator of elder abuse. Comparatively, the definitions of abuse for older people are very similar to those for children. As with child abuse, chiropractors have a legal and ethical obligation to report any suspected elder abuse69 with confidentiality \"to the local office of the Senior and Disabled Services Division or to a law enforcement agency within the county where the person making the report is located at the time of contact.\"70 They may not be sued for such reporting.71 Section 7 BOUNDARY ISSUES IN THE PATIENT-DOCTOR RELATIONSHIP Across time and culture there has been recognition of the exceptional power given to physicians by patients and the potential for misuse of that power. A chiropractor, as a fiduciary, provides help and care for the patient.72 The patient is protected from abuses of power by the ethics and character of the chiropractor and the prescribed boundaries and roles that define professional behavior. Boun daries define the expected psychological, physical and social distance between patients and practitioners. They are derived from ethical treatise, cultural morality and jurisprudence.73 Boundaries form protection for the patient so that professional care occurs safely within the unique form of social intimacy of the patient-doctor relationship. Specific to this relationship, \"The health and welfare of the patient shall always be the first priority of Chiropractic physicians.\"16 Unprofessional conduct by a chiropractic physician, includes, but is not limited to: \"Engaging in any conduct or verbal behavior with or towards a patient that may be reasonably interpreted by the patient as sexual, seductive or demeaning;\"74 proof of actual injury need not be established.\"74 Patients who are in pain or who are ill are vulnerable to psychological regression. Transferential dynamics are common in clinical encounters where patients are dependent and physically and emotionally more vulnerable. It is common for patients to be emotionally and/or physically attracted to professionals who care for them. When alerted, physicians should take extra steps to define or clarify the professional relationship. \"The chiropractor is the one who must recognize and set the boundaries between the care and compassion appropriate to the chiropractic treatment and the emotional responses that may lead to sexual misconduct.\" 75 The power differential inherent in the patient -doctor relationship makes true consent to sexual contact by the patient impossible.72,76 With the exception of pre-existing consensual relationships, it is clearly unethical to have sexual contact or a romantic relationship with a patient concurrent with the patient-doctor relationship.70,76- 91 There is a range of opinions with respect to the ability of the patient-doctor relationship to change after care has ended. Some suggest a sexual relationship may never be appropriate70, while others indicate an interim period ranging from three months to one year between termination and initiation of a personal intimate relationship.77,81 Even those authorities who indicate that sexual or romantic relationships with former patients may be ethical, prohibit the physician from the following: using or exploiting trust, knowledge, or influence of emotions derived from the previous professional relationship; using privileged information to meet their personal or sexual needs; and abusing authority or power derived from the previous professional relationship.74,86 Where there may be a question as to the status of the patient, i.e. current or former, some licensing boards have chosen to adopt more subjective criteria to determine if sexual misconduct has occurred. Following are some of the areas of consideration likely to be evaluated by a licensing board to determine the current status of the patient: evidence of termination procedures;73,74 circumstances of cessation or termination;74,92 time passage since therapy termination; 74,92 nature and duration of therapy; 73,74,92 former client's personal history and/or current mental status; 92 statements and/or actions made by the physician during the course of care suggesting or inviting the possibility of a post termination relationship; 92 likelihood of adverse impact on the person and/or others; 92 transfer of patient's care to another physician; 74 the nature of the patient's chiropractic problem; 74 extent to which the patient has confided personal and/or private information to the chiropractor; 74 degree of emotional dependence on the chiropractor; 74 extent of chiropractor's knowledge about the patient; 74 any other relevant information.73 Consequences of sexual misconduct for patients of health care professionals have been documented to include: distrust and anger toward physicians; delays in seeking health care; increased depression, shame, guilt; psychosomatic symptoms; post-traumatic stress disorder (panic attacks, flashbacks, extreme guilt and self-destructive feelings). 81,93 Consequences of sexual misconduct extend be yond the patient to potentially affect the patient's family, the doctor's family, the doctor's staff, other patients, the community and the profession.81 Consequences of sexual misconduct for the chiropractor may include Board sanctions such as license suspension or revocation, probation, chaperone requirements and mandated counseling. Additionally, civil suits or criminal prosecution, extortion or retaliation are possible consequences of unprofessional conduct. See Appendix C for strategies that may prevent boundary violations and/or allegations of sexual misconduct. Section 8 THE PATIENT-DOCTOR RELATIONSHIP AND INDEPENDENT EXAMINATIONS Independent and second opinion examinations are isolated chiropractic evaluations of an individual's health performed by a physician not involved in that person's care.94,95 When performed by a chiropractic physician, these may be referred to as IMEs (independent medical examinations) or ICEs (independent chiropractic examinations). All independent examinations perfo rmed by a chiropractor to determine the need for chiropractic care shall include a functional chiropractic analysis.96 Some combination of the following of the PARTS exam constitutes a functional chiropractic analysis: P Location, quality, and intensity of pain or tenderness produced by palpation and pressure over specific structures and soft tissues; A Asymmetry of sectional or segmental components identified by static palpation; R The decrease or loss of specific movements (active, passive, and accessory); T Tone, texture, and temperature change in specific soft tissues identified through palpation; S Use of special tests or procedures.97 In the context of independent examinations the use of an investigational procedure is considered inappropriate. These types of evaluations may be ordered by treating physicians, employers, patients and their attorneys, insurers, disability management companies and managed care organizations, workers compensation boards, and other entities that make determinations about disability and impairment.95 An independent examination may be performed at various stages of an injury or illness and is generally utilized to clarify health and/or job issues.95 At the outset of the examination, prior to gathering health information, the examining physician should ensure to the extent possible that the patient understands the ethical obligations of the physician to perform an impartial evaluation. The examiner also explains the differences between the role of independent examiner and the traditional fiduciary role of the physician. The examiner should explain who has requested the examination. In an independent examination, the patient-doctor relationship is limited because the examiner does not monitor the patient's health over time, provide treatment or fulfill many duties traditionally performed by physicians.94 Despite the limited relationship, important health information, diagnosis and treatment recommendations shall be made available to the patient, treating docto r, and patient's legal counsel or guardian via the independent report.98,99 Upon request, a copy of the independent report shall be made available to the patient, the treating doctor, and/or the patient's legal guardian. 98,99 Section 9 TERMINATION OF THE PATIENT-DOCTOR RELATIONSHIP Once the patient-doctor relationship has been established, it may be terminated by either party. Patient Termination The most common way for patients to end the relationship is their recovery from the condition for which they were receiving chiropractic care.100 Another way the patient may terminate the relationship is to discharge the physician at any time.100 If at the time of termination by the patient, it is the opinion of the treating physician that the condition requires further care, it is suggested that the physician notify the patient. This should be documented by the physician. Physician Termination Physicians may terminate the patient-doctor relationship at their discretion, but must not abandon the patient. The patient must be given reasonable notice,16 preferably in writing. By sending the notice \"return receipt requested\" the physician will have the assurance that the patient was notified. The patient must also be given reasonable time to locate another physician. The courts have held that once a physician has agreed to treat a patient a physician cannot cease his treatment except, first with the consent of the patient, or secondly upon giving the patient time and notice so that he may employ another doctor or thirdly when the condition of the patient is such that medical treatment is no longer required.100 Abandonment Abandonment has been defined as \"the unilateral severance by the physician of the physician- patient relationship\" without reasonable notice, at a time when there is still the necessity of continuing medical attention.100 Abandonment involves intent on the part of the physician to improperly terminate the patient-doctor relationship.100 Examples of abandonment include: the physician fails to provide adequate withdrawal notice to the patient; the physician fails to see a patient within a clinically indicated timeframe; the physician withdraws from a patient case without making arrangements for continued care for lack of payment or any other reason. Physician Substitution/Referral Physicians are entitled to reasonable time away from their practices as long as arrangements are made for a competent, licensed substitute. Notice must be given to the patient of the substitution, as the patient may prefer to consult with a doctor other than the substitute.100 If notice is not given and the patient's condition suffers an adverse effect the physician may be held to have abandoned the patient.100 If the substitute is an \"employee\" of the physician, standard rules of vicarious liability may apply. If the substitute is unqualified or incompetent the physician may also be liable for the substitute's negligence. In multi-physician practices where each physician sees the others' patients on a rotating basis, none of the physicians can be held to have abandoned a patient if another member of the group or partnership has seen that patient.100 When a physician refers a patient to a second physician, the referring physician cannot be held liable for abandonment as long as due care is used in selecting the second physician.100 This referral should be documented by the referring physician Physicians have the right to make reasonable limitations on their practice.100 Physicians are not legally obligated to treat any patient beyond the chosen limitations of their practice. In such circumstances, referral to another physician does not constitute abandonment. 100 Section 10 PATIENT-DOCTOR RELATIONSHIP STANDARDS 1. Informed Consent The patient has the right to informed consent regarding procedures, risks and alternatives, and answers to questions with respect to treatment, in terms that they can be reasonably expected to understand. In order to obtain the informed consent of a patient, the chiropractic physician shall explain the following: (a) In general terms the procedure or treatment to be undertaken; (b) That there may be alternative procedures or methods of treatment, if any; and (c) That there are risks, if any, to the procedure or treatment. 28 (Legal Type 1) 2. Patient Confidentiality The patient has the right to expect that all communications and records pertaining to their care will be treated as confidential. 19,39,40-43,45 The chiropractor shall preserve a patient's medical records from disclosure and wil l release specific records only on a patient's written consent stating to whom the records are being released or as required by State or Federal law.38 (Legal Type 1) 3. Abandonment The patient has the right to continuity of care once the doctor has agreed to treat the patient. The chiropractor may terminate the patient-doctor relationship only when the patient has been given reasonable notice.16 (Legal Type 1) 4. Patient-Doctor Boundaries With the exception of pre-existing consensual sexual relationships, it is clearly unethical to have sexual contact or a romantic relationship with a patient concurrent with the patient- doctor relationship. Chiropractors shall not engage in any conduct or verbal behavior with or towards a patient that may be reasonably interpreted by the patient as sexual, seductive or demeaning. 72,73,77- 90 (Legal Type 1) 5. Independent Medical Examinations All independent and second opinion examinations performed by a chiropractor to determine the need for chiropractic care shall include a functional chiropractic analysis.96 A copy of the independent report shall be made available, upon request, to the patient, the patient's attorney and the treating doctor.99 All independent and second opinion examiners have an ethical obligation to perform an impartial examination. (Legal Type 1) 6. Child and Elder Abuse Reporting Chiropractors must report child abuse and elder abuse to the appropriate officials.63,69 (Legal Type 1) REFERENCES 1.

Such barriers may include the following: shame, humiliation, embarrassment; 48-51 psychological repression, poor self-esteem/self-image; 48,50,52 fear of reprisal, retribution, repercussions, e.g. threats to kill or harm children, family, friends, etc.;48, 49, 51-54 fear of abandonment,49 poverty/economic concerns,48,50,52,54 loneliness,52 49,50,52 religious traditions;48,50,52 cultural: social, family, marital expectations; 48,50-52 feel protective of partner; 51 thinks the doctor does not know or care about or can help with domestic violence; 51 thinks the doctor is too busy; 51 alcohol or drug problems; 49 language barriers;50 Physician Barriers To Screening For/Identifying Domestic Violence Health care providers identify several reasons why they are reluctant to ask patients about domestic violence. Such barriers to screening/identifying domestic violence may include the following: lack of knowledge and training,48,51,54, unprepared to respond; 48,51 because of the clinical presentation, patients may appear to be neurotic or hypochondriacs; 48 discomfort due to own feelings and reactions to a disclosure of abuse; 48 misconceptions such as abuse is rare,48 private,48,51 the battered victim's fear of \"fix\" abusive relationship s; 49,51 time constraints/lack of time to deal with the problem; 49,51,54,57. personal bias against women in international community,50 racial prejudice; 50,54 sexism; 50,54 frustration with outcome, don't think it will help and \"she'll just go back to him ;\" 51,57 physicians' beliefs or values about abuse; 54 loss of control or feelings of powerlessness; 54 belief that a victim can leave if he/she just wants to; 51 knowing the assailant and not believing he is capable of abuse. 51 Patterns of Abuse There is no single model which can describe all domestic violence patterns.48 However, it is useful to consider the following models to conceptualize the abuse process in women. One model describes a cycle of violence in phases where phase one begins with a minor battering/assault which gradually increases tension in the relationship. The victim may try to decrease the tension but is largely unsuccessful.48 Phase two involves a discharge of building tension resulting in an acute battering incident which may be met with disbelief or denial and is dismissed by the victim as an isolated incident. Subsequent episodes are met with shock, rationalization, self blame, denial and repression.48 Phase three is often referred to as the \"honeymoon phase\"48 where the abuser expresses remorse, exhibits attentiveness, reaffirms love and promises it will never happen again.48,57 This is done mostly out of fear of being caught.48 There is not always a honeymoon phase.48 Another model highlights the roles of violence and withdrawal where some lesser degree of violence creates emotional withdrawal in the attacked partner. The abuser may be met with withdrawal the next time upset, needy or in want of support. This in turn provokes a more violent attack, which is followed by further withdrawal and/or fear. The escalating cycle of neediness is met with increasing withdrawal until the violence becomes severe.58 In addition to the physical violence, emotional abuse always accompanies and typically precedes physical violence.48 This cycle of violence is repetitive, escalates in severity and frequency 48,49,57,58 and is used to gain compliance or control over the victim.51 Profile of the Abuser Battering and abuse are learned behaviors that result from being personally abused or witnessing abuse.48,51 Abusers may be characterized by any or all of the following: extreme jealousy and possessiveness; 48 inefficient coping skills; 48 thinking they are unique and don't have to follow rules; 48 justifying behavior with excuses blaming others for causing their behavior; 48 viewing others as holding them back from being successful; 48 minimizing abuse as part of avoiding responsibility for violent actions; 48 having trouble experiencing close, satisfying relationships with others; 48 substituting drama and excitement for closeness; 48 being secretive, closed minded, self righteous;48 seeking to gain power and control; 48,54,57 fragmentation (Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde) using a public face that is childlike, dependent, insecure, charming, affectionate, seductive or manipulative; 48 alcohol use or abuse involved 48,49,52,54-57 but not established as causal. 48,52 Women at Increased Risk for Domestic Violence There is no specific highly predictive profile of women at increased risk for domestic violence; however, following are some generalizations about vulnerabilities: witness or experience family violence as a child or adolescent; 48,49,51,57 however, the majority did not grow up in abusive homes; 48 under 35 years of age; 49,54,57 refugee, migrant50,54 living in rural or remote areas, 50 homebound; 50 conflicting evidence about minorities being more vulnerable; 50,57 lower socioeconomic status 50,54,57 or education; 49 pregnancy; 57 mental illness, physical disabilities; 54 unmarried; 49 unmarried couple living together; 58 wives in marriages where their education or occupation level is higher than their spouse; 51 mixed marriages (religion or race); 51 history of alcohol abuse by male partner; 54 recently separated or divorced. 57 Presentation The majority of domestic violence presentations are not \"injuries,\" but are seen for non -traumatic diagnoses.48,51,54 Chiropractors should be aware that chronic pain 51,52,56,57 or back pain itself 48 may be the result of domestic violence. Other clinical findings that may suggest need for further investigation include the following: 1. Injuries explanation for injuries does not fit injuries observed; 48,49,51,56 multiple injuries in various stages of repair; 48,51,52 assaultive trauma, most commonly head, face, neck and areas covered by clothing; mandibular fractures; facial fractures; trunk trauma; blows to abdomen or other areas; other blunt trauma or injuries suggestive of defensive posturing like forearm fractures; 49,51,52,56,58 \"accident 51,52 pain; 48 chest pain; 48,51,52,57 pain from trauma without visible evidence.52 be psychosomatic; 48,51,57 sleep disturbance, e.g. insomnia; 48,51,52,57 fatigue, decreased energy, 51,52 dyspnea; 51,52 upper respiratory tract infections, bronchitis; 54,56 poor control of diabetes, hypertension, heart disease. 51 4. Obstetric, Gynecologic Problems miscarriages; 48,49,52,57 injured pregnant woman49,51,52,57 no 52 dyspareunia; 52 pelvic pain; 48,51,52 injuries to breasts, abdomen or genitals; 52 substance abuse, poor nutrition and/or inadequate weight gain during pregnancy. 52 5. Emotional and Behavioral or Psychological Sequelae of Violence depression; 48,49,51-53,57 suicide illness; 48 inability to cope; 52 nervous behavior, lack of eye contact, worrying about staying too long in office, frequent comments that she has to check with her partner, comments that partner is jealous, financial dependence, shy, frightened, embarrassed, noncompliant, evasive, passive, cries; 48 poor self-esteem, social isolation; 48,52 hovering (batterer accompanies victim to monitor reactions/disorder; 49,52,57,58 panic 51,52,57 drugs and alcohol abuse. 48,49,51-53,56-58 6. Other more likely to be prescribed analgesics, minor tranquilizers48,52,57 and antidepressants; 48 multiple visits 56 or frequent visits without physiologic abnormality; 52 long term disability from injuries; 58 homelessness or welfare.58 Screening and Identification Physicians routinely screen for problems less prevalent than domestic violence, and yet routine screening for domestic violence is rarely practiced.48,49,53 This is especially true in the primary care setting where it is estimated that less than 10% of primary care physicians routinely screen for domestic violence during a regular office visit.53 Battery is so prevalent that physicians in an entry-level health care system have an ethical obligation to consider abuse as a possibility in their evaluation of female patients.48,52 Screening is simply asking the patient a few direct questions. The goal of screening is not for the physician to \"fix\" the problem but t o identify the abuse and provide appropriate education, support, and referrals, and to acknowledge and validate the situation as real and dangerous.48,52 Before initiating any discussions about domestic violence, the physician must put the patient in a position to disclose this information safely and confidentially (without partner and/or children present).48,51,54-57 The FAMILY VIOLENCE PREVENTION FUND recommends screening begin as early as age 14.53 It is recommended that all female patients are screened whether signs or symptoms are present or not and whether abuse is suspected or not. Battered women/victims favor routine questions about domestic violence and expect their physicians to initiate discussions about it.48,49 While many find it difficult to volunteer the information, most women are willing to discuss issues about violence if specifically asked. Questions should be direct, sensitive, empathetic, nonjudgmental and asked in a confidential setting.48-50,52,57 It is recommended that direct questions about abuse be included in the routine history49,52,57 as no one can be excluded from screening.56 This is because the prevalence is so high,49,54,56 the prevalence of undetected cases is high, 48,49,57 and there is no, or low, positive predictive presentations for the presence of domestic violence.48,52,54,57 In addition, screening for abuse should be considered for each new complaint or when the patient has a new intimate partner. 53 Phrasing Questions An easy way to introduce the topic is a s tatement such as \"Because violence is so common, I've begun to ask about it routinely\" or \"I've begun to ask all my patients about it.\" 52,53 This may then be followed by one of the following or similar questions: \"Are you in a relationship with a person who physically hurts or threatens you?\"53 \"Have you been hit, kicked, punched or otherwise hurt by someone in the past year? 52,53,58 If so, by whom?\" 54 \"At anytime has your partner or anyone at home hit, hurt or frightened you?\"53 Patient Denies Abuse or Does Not Want To Discuss The Topic When patients' deny abuse or are reluctant to discuss the topic, they should not be badgered. 48,54 Providing a list of local programs presents a less threatening resource than face to face confrontation while still providing support for the patient.52,54 It is appropriate, however, to make further inquiries with more specific questions when the patient answers \"no\" or will not discuss the topic if there are signs and/or symptoms strongly indicating abuse.52 Some examples of this follow: \"It looks as though someone may have hurt you. Could you tell me what happened?\"52 \"Sometimes when people come for healthcare with physical symptoms like yours, we find that there may be trouble at home. We are concerned that som eone is hurting or abusing you. Is this happening?\"52 \"Sometimes when people feel the way you do, it's because they may have been hurt or abused at home. Is this happening to you?\"52 Patient Acknowledges Abuse or Wants To Discuss the Topic When the patient acknowledges abuse or wants to discuss the topic, it is important to listen non-judgmentally51,52,54 and assure the patient that the disclosure is confidential.48,53 In addition, validation48,52,54,57 of their position with any of the following statements provides further support: \"No one deserves to be hurt or threatened with violence.\" (The most important and easily provided intervention is this simple message.)48,54 \"You are not to blame for the behavior of the perpetrator.\"54 \"You are not alone.\"52 \"You \"Help is available.\"52 \"I have treated others with this problem and am comfortable dealing with it.\"52 It is important to educate the patient48,49,54,57 about the escalating cycle of abuse (nature and course)48,49,57 which not only produces serious medical problems48,57 but is also a criminal act 48,54 for which there are protective service agencies and legal assistance, e.g. civil protection orders/restraining orders, criminal prosecution, civil litigation, etc.49-52,54,55,57 Legible, accurate, detailed and complete documentation by the physician is invaluable for legal purposes.51,52,54 This may provide the only evidence that abuse has taken place51 and improves the likelihood of successful prosecution.54 Good records also frequently substitute for personal appearance by the physician in a legal setting.57 It may be reasonable to establish a \"confidential\" file set for domestic violence cases in order to further limit access and protect the confidentiality of the patient. Along with the medical information, the file should include the arrival date and time, name, address, phone number of anyone with the victim and the address where the incident occurred.52 It is appropriate to begin with an all inclusive medical, trauma and relevant social history,52 in addition to a history of the incident using the patient's own words48,51,52,54 with modifiers such as \"the patient states...\" 48,51 when possible. A list of complaints and symptoms52,55 should be obtained and a complete physical examination including neurological examination, radiographic evaluation, and rape assessment, if appropriate,52 should be performed. If any special services aren't available in the physician's office, referral to an appropriate facility for documentation is indicated. (See Appendix D) Body diagrams/maps48,49,54 may be useful for documenting a detailed description of the injuries including extent,48 resolution/acuity,48,52 measurements/size,48,52 type, number, and location. 52 Results of laboratory testing, diagnostic imaging or other diagnostic procedures should be included in the chart. The physician should document whether the injuries are consistent with the patient's explanation .52 If possible, photographs should also be included because they are particularly valuable as evidence.54 Prior to taking photographs, written informed consent should be obtained48,52,58 in addition to having a female chaperone present.48 If available, a digital camera has the greatest versatility for documenting visible injuries. Two views of each injury should be taken, including a measuring device51,52 and at least one picture with the patient's face for identification.51,52 The photographs should be marked with the following information: name of patient, photographer, witnesses,51,52 time,48,52 place,48 chart/record number,51 and date and signature of the photographer.48,58 The photographs should be placed in a sealed envelope with the patient's name and social security number and put in a safe place.48 If a standard camera is used, label the films and keep secure until developed51 at which time 2- 3 copies should be made. If the police are involved, the investigating officer and any action taken should be documented if possible.52 The police should only be called with the patient's documented consent; however, there are some exceptions where reporting is mandatory, which include the following: If there is evidence of injury by gunshot, knife or other deadly weapon. 51,55,57,58 Child abuse, elder abuse or neglect. 62,69 Where there is a duty to protect a potential third party victim from danger.48,51,52,55 According to the Tarasoff case of 1976, if it is determined the patient presents a serious danger of violence to another, th e health care provider is obliged to use reasonable care to protect the intended victim against such danger via notification of the intended victim, notification of the police or taking whatever steps reasonably necessary under the circumstances. Sixteen states have adopted Tarasoff limiting statutes, which only require reporting when there is an explicit threat made.55 \"In Oregon, the duty to warn is not clear. In the case of possible domestic violence, the physician, upon advice of legal counsel, should err on the side of caution and warn the at- risk spouse or partner.\"52 It is very important to include an assessment of the patient's danger and fear. 48,51,52,54,57,58 To evaluate the patient's level and immediacy of danger, it may be helpful to ask some further questions,48 as the most critical components of assessment are the patient's level of fear and appraisal of immediate and future safety.52 Following are some questions that may provide further insight to the patient's position: \"Are you in immediate danger?\" \"What do you think will happen when you go home?\" 48,54 (This is one of the most important questions: \"Is it safe to go home?\"51) \"Is another violent attack imminent?\"48 \"How frequent the attacks?\" 48,51 \"Are they escalating?\"51,52 \"Do they have a firearm or deadly weapon?\"48,51,52,54 \"Is there a history of violent behavior outside the home51 or history of violent acts or threats using a weapon?\"51,58 \"Have they threatened to kill you48,51,52 or you them?\"48,51 \"Is there dru g or alcohol use?\"48,51,58 as this makes behavior less predictable.48 \"Have there been threats to children?\"48,52,54,58 \"Are you, or a partner, threatening suicide and if so, is there a suicide plan?\" If so, the situation is urgent.48,51,52 \"Are there forced unwanted types of sex or refusing to use birth control?\"53 \"Is there humiliation, swearing, name calling, mental instability, obsession with victim,51,58 drug/alcohol use or abuse?\" 58 \"Are there threats to injure self or patient,52 reporting to immigr ation or stalking?\"58 \"Is there isolation which includes controlling access to friends and family and limiting outside involvement?\"51,53,58 \"Has there been destructive behavior such as destroying patient's property, injuring pets of patient or child?\"58 \"Does the abusive partner control all the money?\"51,58 Appropriate treatment for the patient's injuries should be provided52 as well as appropriate referrals for support. (See Appendix D) In addition, it is important to discuss alternatives in a safe place, 51,56,57 giving the patient an opportunity to decrease the sense of isolation and lack of power.57 The patient may or may not be in immediate danger and may or may not want access to a shelter. Based on these criteria, additional decision-making and appropriate action may proceed. If the patient is in immediate danger, it should be determined if there are family or friends to stay with50-52 or if immediate access to a shelter51,52,57 or police contact is wanted.52,54 An opportunity should also be given to use a private phone to assist with any/all of the above.52 If there is no immediate danger or the patient doesn't want immediate access to a shelter, the chiropractor may offer written information about shelters and other community resources 48-52,54,55,57 or instructions how to find this information in the phone book.48 Shelters and affiliated agency referrals should be made carefully and only to those dedicated to assisting battered women.48 Affiliated agencies and community resources may include the following: children's services, counseling, legal and employment services54 and law enforcement.50,51 With respect to legal needs, possibilities are criminal prosecution, civil litigation,52,57 civil protection/restraining orders,51,52, 57 temporary custody, and mandatory payment of rent or mortgage.54 It is important to remember that written information may be dangerous for the patient to possess.48,52 The patient should not be forced to take written information. The number of a local hotline or other information may be most safely given on a prescription blank or appointment card.52 The victim should be assisted in developing a safety plan48,50-52,54,57,58 with which they can prepare for future situations as well as make judgments about the safety of their current situation. This should be an ongoing process where questions such as \"Is it safe to go home?\"48,51,54 can help the victim to regularly assess their safety status. Identification of potentially dangerous situations and appropriate responses increase the preparation and safety when or if the risk of violence increases.48,50 Options should include planning for immediate relocation to a shelter57 and/or seeking shelter and financial help from family and friends.50-52 If possible, three options should be included for emergencies where shelters may be full, family and friends are out of town, etc. Victims should be given information directly and/or made aware of how to access available resource numbers for assistance.48-52,54,55,57 A packed overnight bag57 or \"flight kit\" which may be an unused suitcase placed in a well-hidden area52 should include as many of the following items as possible: enough money to get started, clothing, medicine, address book, car/house keys, valuables, books, children's toys, papers (social security card, health insurance information, birth certificates, driver's license, restraining order, etc.).58 In the case where no apparent emergent situation exists and the patient is returning home, a follow up appointment should be scheduled.48 Despite the limited and imperfect options for detecting and intervening in domestic violence situations, the benefits are substantial for families in which the cycle of abuse is interrupted.49 Patients should not leave the health care facility without knowing that battering is a crime and there is help in the judicial system.54 It would be useful for the physician to be familiar with, or help develop, a network with physicians, and community referral resources (shelters, legal servi ces, law enforcement, district attorney's office, etc.) as this can be extremely effective in developing a coordinated response to meet the complex needs of battered women.51 Educational Materials for the Health Care Providers Chiropractors can increase public awareness about domestic violence,48,57 show willingness to discuss the topic,48 and help women understand the problem50 by having pamphlets, posters, etc. in the office. This is an important form of intervention and prevention.57 There should be materials from community resources relating to domestic violence in the waiting room, examination room, female restrooms and other strategic locations.49,51 57 It is also important to support culturally sensitive publications in different languages for women in the international community as it is more difficult for them due to cultural, religious, social, family, legal and immigration reasons.50 Child Abuse The various forms of abuse have potential physical and behavioral indicators. 62 (A) Physical abuse, possible physical indicators; bruises and welts on the body; bruises and welts reflecting the shape of an object used (electrical chord, belt buckle); various types of burns (cigarette, rope, etc.); laceration; fractures. Physical abuse, possible behavioral indicators: wary of adult contacts; apprehensive when other children cry; behavioral extremes; frightened of parents; afraid to go home. (B) Neglect, possible physical indicators: consistent hunger, poor hygiene, inappropriate dress; consistent lack of supervision; unattended physical and/or emotional problems or medical needs. Neglect, possible behavioral indicators: begging, stealing food; extended stays at school; poor school performance; fatigue; alcohol or drug abuse; delinquency. (C) Mental injury or emotional maltreatment, possible physical indicators: failure to grow; speech or sleep disorders; forced to dress in \"opposite sex\" clothing. Mental injury or emotional maltreatment, possible behavioral indicators: behavior extremes: aggression or withdrawal; habit disorders (sucking, biting, rocking); attempted suicide; conduct disorders (antisocial, runaway, destructive behavior); emotionally needy. (D) Sexual abuse, possible physical indicators: difficulty in walking or sitting; pain or itching in the genital area; bruises, bleeding or infection in external genital area; venereal disease; pregnancy. Sexual abuse, possible behavioral indicators: withdrawal, fantasy or infantile behavior; poor peer relationships; delinquent or runaway; reports sexual assault (children seldom lie about sexual abuse); refer also to behavioral indicators of mental injury or emotional maltreatment. Elder Abuse Observations suggestive of elder maltreatment include: 68 (A) General absence of caregiver or abandonment; poor supervision; recent conflicts or crises; medication problems (duplications or unusual dosages); recurrent healthcare admissions or visits; delay in seeking care; unexplained injuries; inconsistent histories between patient and caregiver. (B) Patient fearful of caregiver. (C) Patient or caregiver depressed; reluctant to answer questions. Physical indicators of elder abuse:68 (A) Physical abuse unexplained bruises, wounds, burns, or other injuries; rope or restraint marks on wrists and/or ankles. (B) Psychological abuse habit disorder (sucking, rocking); neurotic disorders (antisocial, borderline). (C) Neglect dehydration or malnutrition; poor hygiene; inappropriate dress; unattended physical or medical needs. APPENDIX C STRATEGIES THAT MAY PREVENT BOUNDARY VIOLATIONS AND/OR ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT A. Office Procedures provisions for chaperones as needed; provisions for patient modesty (privacy when disrobing, draping, etc); patient bill of rights; staff communication; staff availability near treatment rooms; consent to treat minors; documentation of incidents; follow-up/response to complaints; termination or referral of patients. B. Staff Education sexual harassment policy; expectations regarding communication and behavior in the office; not discussing intimate subjects, personal problems or lives with patients; confidentiality; socializing with patients. C. Self Assessment Tools to Analyze Risk Risk factor analysis (See Appendix E) 91 The Exploitation Index: An early warning indicator of boundary violations in psychotherapy. (See Appendix F) 101 D. Access to Mentors or Second Opinions Doctors are often isolated in practice. An experienced colleague or counselor can provide insight, and help with difficult and/or sensitive issues that arise in practice. E. Patient Education/Orientation chaperone option offered to patient; query patients regarding their concerns; pamphlets, videotapes, report of findings, PARQ conference (see Section 3); clinic procedure regarding disrobing, gowning, and draping. F. Identification of High Risk Situations for the Chiropractor attraction to a patient; personal relationship problems; times of emotional distress; substance abuse; burn-out. G. Recognition of High Risk Patient Behaviors inappropriate gifts, cards or correspondence; inappropriate \"personal\" comments and questions; sexual innuendo and humor; seductive clothing or behavior; seeking inappropriate extended visits and/or care.

This questionnaire was created by Ben Benjamin, Ph.D., and Angelica Redleaf, D.C.; some portions are adapted from the article \"Are You In Trouble With A Client?\" by Estelle Disch, Ph.D., which appeared in Massage Therapy Journal , Summer 1992. Ben Benjamin is the director of the Muscular Therapy Institute in Cambridge, Mass. Estelle Disch has practiced for more than 20 years as a clinical sociologist and psychotherapist in Boston, Mass., and is the co-director of BASTA! (Boston Associates to Stop Therapy Abuse). What is the Risk Factor Analysis? The RFA asks very specific questions. Some are about stress you may be experiencing in your life or in your practice. Others are about attractions to patients, interactions with patients, and attitudes towards patients. The questions are based on typical kinds of doctor behaviors and attitudes. The RFA is meant for you to keep to yourself. It can be taken again from time to time - for example, every six months - to give you a quick idea of your risk level. It can be used independently of the Practice Analysis, which includes more general questions about doctor and staff behavior and attitudes. How does the RFA Differ from the Doctor Self-Analysis? The RFA and the Doctor Self-Evaluation Questionnaire (DSE) both ask the practitioner to self-evaluate his or her level of risk. The DSE asks general questions about your behaviors, attitudes, skills, and attributes, and about your staff's behaviors, skills, and attitudes. The RFA asks very specific questions that are designed to give you a quick idea of the level of risk you are incurring by practicing the way that you do. By comparing your responses to both questionnaires, (see page 158) you will be able to gain a very clear picture of what you think about yourself as a practitioner, and of what you think about your staff. This information is a good start, but neither of these self- evaluations can see past your own blind spots. The rest of the Practice Analysis will either confirm, challenge, or illuminate your ideas about yourself as a practitioner, and about your practice as a whole. Instructions Place a check-mark next to the number (1, 2, or 3) of each statement that applies to you. When you have completed the questionnaire, add up all of the numbers that are the same - i.e. add up all the number 1s on a page and write that number at the bottom of each sheet, then do the same for all the 2s and 3s on each sheet. Add up the totals for each number on the last page in the space provided. Directions for assessing your RFA numbers are on the next page. At the end of the self-scoring section, there are guidelines for comparing your RFA results with the results of the Doctor Self-Evaluation and the rest of the Practice Analysis.

If you have checked off even one number 3: You are at risk. Know that you are a ticking time bomb who could potentially hurt yourself, your patient(s) and your profession! You would be very wise to get help from a therapist, consultant or significant other. You also should consider getting training in this area. Ignoring your high risk or attempting to get through this by yourself might be very unwise. If you have checked off more than three number 2s: You have the potential for problems. The more number 2s you check off, the more your risk factor increases. You could use some help in getting yourself on track concerning professional boundaries. If you checked off more than five number 1s: You may be overstepping your professional boundaries. You might not be in danger of overstepping them sexually, but you still could find yourself losing your effectiveness as a health provider. Be aware of your attitudes about patients, yourself, and your practice. During times of stress and personal loss, we are more likely to overstep our professional boundaries. There are training sessions available that address the questions of boundaries and sexual misconduct, and there are therapists, mentors, friends, and colleagues who could help you at such times. Your risk is greatest when you attempt to go through such a transition all by yourself. Redleaf A, Baird SA. Behind closed doors: gender, sexuality, and touch in the doctor/patient relationship.

It is the responsibility of the chiropractic physician to keep abreast of advancements in diagnostic imaging. The chiropractic physician must make imaging decisions based on what is best for the patient.1 This chapter presents current knowledge regarding the utilization of diagnostic imaging in the assessment of chiropractic patients. APPROPRIATE UTILIZATION OF RADIOGRAPHIC STUDIES While diagnostic-imaging procedures may be vital to diagnosis and case management, the decision to utilize any diagnostic imaging procedure should be based on a demonstrated need (i.e. clinical necessity) following an adequate case history and physical examination.2 Once radiographs have been obtained, it is required3 that a report of the findings be recorded and placed in the patient's permanent record. It is the responsibility of the clinician to ensure that all radiographs are evaluated for pathologic and biomechanical information. All radiographic reports will include the patient's name, age, sex, date of examination and report, and area of study and views. A narrative of radiographic findings, and impressions should be included. The following discussion is designed to assist in the plain film radiographic decision-making process. The guidelines are divided into categories as shown in Table 1. These categories include: clinical indicators, structural and functional abnormalities, other indicators, and inappropriate use of x-rays. All relevant clinical and historical information needs to be considered.4-39 The practitioner's clinical judgment will be the basis for determining whether to take radiographs or not. 40 CLINICAL INDICATIONS Table 1: Guidelines for Chiropractic Utilization of Radiographic Studies History of malignancy (with unexplained new symptoms) 4,5,6,7,11,12, 17, 19, 29 Significant trauma, recent trauma, repetitive trauma with significant clinical findings4,5,6,7,12,13,14,15,16,17,18, 19 Old trauma in the area of complaint 3 Suspected fractures5,10,18 Clinically significant neurologic signs and symptoms 4,5,6,7,13,14,15,16,19,29 Unexplained weight loss 4,5,6,7,14,17,19, 29 Unrelenting night pain 6, 17, 35 Pain unrelieved by recumbency 6,7,29, 38 Suspicion or history of inflammatory arthritis with change in symptoms 4,5,11,13,14,31 Known or suspected bone density loss 6,7,12 Palpable mass 5 Unless specifically indicated, this Educational Manual constitutes practice recommendations and not administrative rules. 2 Substance abuse 4,5,7,14 Prolonged corticosteroid use 4,5,7,14,17 Fever of unknown origin (>100\u00b0 F) 4,5,7,14,17 Suspected infection 5,6,7,11,29 Abnormal laboratory finding (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate [ESR], White Blood Cell Count [WBC], etc.) 5,6,7,11,17 Recent surgery or invasive procedure related to chief complaint 5, 17 Failure to improve without prior radiography 4,5,6,14,17 Patients over 50 years of age are at greater risk of having significant pathologies4,5,7,12,14,17,19,29,32 Identification of Structural or Functional Abnormalities Scoliosis or deformity 5,17,20,21,30 Congenital anomaly 5,13,27 Surgical history Postural abnormalities 17, Hyper/hypomobility 23,24,36 Aberrant motion32 Other Indicators Suspected physical abuse 28 Environmental exposure to toxic or infectious agents 17 Recent immigration or foreign travel 17 Medicolegal implications when combined with clinical indicators4,17,25 Inappropriate use of x-rays Pregnancy - unless the patient's symptoms are of such significance that failure to x-ray would result in a substantial health risk to the mother 8,9 Financial gain 4, 17, 33 Patient education 4, 17 Routine (habitual) screening procedure 4, 17, 26, 33 Research without sanctioned review-board approval 34 Unnecessary duplication of services Routine pre-employment screening 17 Inadequate equipment to produce a diagnostic radiograph 3,5,10,17 Routine discharge radiographs 17,33 Non-licensed operator 3, 17 IMAGING MODALITIES There are a number of imaging modalities available to the chiropractic physician to utilize in the diagnostic work-up and treatment of patients. The following will be a discussion of those modalities including plain film radiography, tomography, imaging (bone scan), myelography, DEXA, PET, and ultrasound. Unless specifically indicated, this Educational Manual constitutes practice recommendations and not administrative rules. 3 Plain Film Radiography The use of plain film radiography in the chiropractic profession began in 1910.36 It was initially used as a research tool and later as the imaging modality of choice for diagnosis of pathology as well as evaluation of postural and biomechanical integrities of the spinal column and pelvis. Use has expanded to include the appendicular skeleton. Plain films offer the doctor insight into pathology, indications and contraindications for chiropractic adjustment, as well as postural and biomechanical alterations.5 The risk of exposure to ionizing radiation mandates that a thorough history and examination be performed prior to the decision to utilize these procedures. AP and lateral radiographs of the skeleton are the most common imaging procedure used in the chiropractic office. Additional views to the minimum diagnostic series include oblique views, angulated spot views, and dynamic stress studies. Oblique projections are essential in evaluating the facet joints of the cervical and lumbar spine as well as the intervertebral foramina (IVF) in the cervical spine. In the appendicular skeleton, oblique projections more fully demonstrate complex anatomy. Angulated projections are helpful in confirming or denying the presence of osseous versus soft tissue lesions. The sacroiliac joints are more clearly demonstrated on the angulated projection than on any other study.37 Dynamic stress views include flexion/extension and lateral bending of the cervical and lumbar spine. These studies reveal information related to the end range of motion.38 Stress radiography is also utilized to evaluate injured joints of the appendicular skeleton. Soft Tissue Radiography Soft tissue radiographs, chest and abdomen, are also utilized by the chiropractic physician. These types of studies may require specialized equipment i.e. film, screens, and grids to produce high quality radiographs. As with all radiographic procedures it is essential to obtain the highest quality radiographs when performing these procedures. Radiographs of soft tissues are strictly taken to evaluate for pathology. Poor quality radiographs reduce the likelihood that abnormalities will be identified. In addition to plain film radiography of the abdomen, contrast studies of the digestive tract, barium swallow and enema, may be utilized by the chiropractic physician. Specialized equipment, i.e. fluoroscope, is needed to insure proper exposure and to produce superior quality radiographs. The images of the procedure must be videotaped. Initial evaluation of these procedures should be done in real time. Special training and experience are required to perform and interpret contrast studies. Minimal Diagnostic Radiographic Series It is accepted within the healthcare community that a minimum series of diagnostic radiographs are needed to evaluate each region of interest. As a general rule two views 90 to each other should be obtained. Some areas require additional views as an essential part of the minimal diagnostic series. The following tables represent the accepted standards. Unless specifically indicated, this Educational Manual constitutes practice recommendations and not administrative rules. 4 Table 2: Minimum Standard Views for the Axial Skeleton, Chest, and Abdom en AREA AP LATERAL OBLIQUE APOM PA ANGULATED CERVICAL39 X X X THORACIC40 X X *LUMBAR41 X X PELVIS X SACRUM/COCCYX X X STERNUM X X CLAVICLE X X RIBS X X SKULL PA Caldwell X CHEST (Full Inspiration)42 LEFT UPRIGHT ABDOMEN X *Lumbar spots may be needed, dependent upon the ability to visualize the L5-S1 region.

A given patient may have specific needs or limitations that affect choices. The exact nature and degree of the pathology suspected affects imaging choices. These factors and the continuing development of imaging protocols make consultation with a radiologist valuable. The information provided here is intended as a general guide.15,46- 58 Magnetic Resonance Imaging Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a valuable diagnostic tool in neuromusculoskeletal imaging. Sectional images can be obtained through all body areas in axial (transverse), sagittal and coronal planes, or at oblique angles for smaller anatomical areas. No ionizing radiation is produced with MRI and risks to appropriately chosen patients have not been identified. Patients with pacemakers, some aneurysm clips, metallic foreign bodies, and other ferromagnetic artifacts are not appropriate candidates for MRI. In general, MRI images tissues based on their hydrogen atom content, reflecting total quantity and molecular bonds. Therefore, both free and intracellular water, and fat produce the majority of the MRI \"signal\" which creates the image. MRI is an excellent procedure for imaging soft tissues of the body including the brain, spinal cord and cerebrospinal fluid, intervertebral discs, articular cartilage, muscles, tendons, ligaments, menisci, and most organs. MRI does not image cortical and trabecular bone though changes in the surrounding marrow can be diagnostic for many osseous pathologies.51 MRI is rarely used as the initial imaging procedure . In many cases, MRI will provide additional information after evaluation of plain film radiographs. MRI may be used as the initial study in cases of significant or rapidly progressing neurologic changes, especially those that indicate central nervous system (CNS ) pathology. MRI is also useful as a follow -up imaging procedure after surgical treatment for IVD herniation and neoplasm. 51 Computed Tomography Computed tomography (CT) combines the imaging physics of plain film x-ray with the advantages of sectional imaging . Like plain film, CT produces its images through the interaction of x-ray photons with the tissues of the body, and is quite valuable in imaging osseous structures .15 CT also carries the same consideration of the potential harmful effects of ionizing radiation. The radiation dose should be kept as low as possible without losing diagnostic information and the risk-benefit ratio carefully weighed. Pathologies containing calcium densities may also be evaluated with CT. Some soft tissues, particularly of the chest and abdomen are best imaged with CT due to limitations of MRI in those areas. Previously known as the CAT (computed axial tomography) scan, it is important to remember that primary or direct images are obtained in the axial plane. Sagittal and coronal reconstructions can be formed with the data obtained in the axial plane, but some extrapolation is done by the computer with a resultant loss of detail. Three-dimensional CT offers limited diagnostic information and is used primarily as a surgical planning tool. Unless specifically indicated, this Educational Manual constitutes practice recommendations and not administrative rules. 7 Computed tomography is used extensively, with and without intravenous contrast agents, for chest and abdomen examinations. It is superior to MRI in most scenarios for the chest and abdomen since the motion artifacts produced by heart contractions and bowel peristalsis may interfere with the acquisition of MR images. Plain film radiographs, as scout films, will often be used for preliminary examination of the chest and abdomen before CT imaging. CT provides detailed evaluation of fractures. This is particularly useful in unusually shaped bones or areas difficult to image with plain film such as the pelvis, craniovertebral junction, posterior elements of the spine, and ankle. Computed tomography may be combined with arthrography when the differential list includes cartilaginous and bony abnormalities or when MRI is inconclusive, such as some cases of glenoid labrum tear. CT evaluation in the musculoskeletal system typically follows radiographic examination. Computed tomography is also used extensively, though less than MRI, in evaluation of the spine, spinal canal, and intervertebral discs. CT is superior to MRI in detailing significant osseous changes, but MRI is usually more valuable in evaluating the impact on neurologic structures. Myelography can improve the ability of CT to evaluate neurologic structures, especially the thecal sac. In some cases, both procedures will be used to reach an accurate diagnosis and provide information for surgical planning. In cases where MRI is not available or not appropriate, CT, with or without myelography, is typically the imaging procedure of choice.51 CT is also used to evaluate head trauma injuries where fracture and acute intracranial bleed are suspected Radionuclide Imaging Radionuclide imaging of bone (bone scan) involves the intravenous administration of a radionuclide tagged to a phosphate analog, which is incorporated in the hydroxyapatite crystal of bone. Gamma rays emitted by the radionuclide are then detected quantitatively to produce an image. The image produced reflects blood flow and areas of increased bone production. Bone scan is much more sensitive than plain film for detecting osseous abnormalities but is distinctly nonspecific and would not be used as the only imaging procedure. A bone scan is typically used when the presence or the location of osseous pathology is questioned. Since almost all pathologies of bone lead to some reactive bone growth, bone scan may be applicable in a wide variety of suspected pathologies. It is most commonly used in the detection of radiographically occult stress fractures, neoplasms, and infection. It is used extensively in the evaluation of skeletal metastasis since the entire skeleton can be imaged at once.15,51 Single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) is a very useful method for displaying multiple planes of radionuclide activity. SPECT is especially useful to identify small areas of osseous pathology, particularly in the spine. Radionuclide scans are also available for many organs. These scans may allow some degree of visualization to evaluate the size and location of organs. They are most useful in their ability to indicate the functional quality of the tissue in question. Unless specifically indicated, this Educational Manual constitutes practice recommendations and not administrative rules. 8 Diagnostic Ultrasound Diagnostic ultrasound (US) is an imaging procedure that relies on the reflection or transmission of sound waves by body tissues for producing images. The added capabilities of Doppler ultrasound allows for the quantification of flow rates in given structures, like arteries. Among the most significant advantages of US are availability, low cost, noninvasiveness, and lack of known harmful effects. This procedure is used frequently in abdominal imaging where it is capable of determining organ size, organ masses, and in distinguishing between cystic, solid, and complex masses. It is typically the first imaging procedure chosen for thyroid abnormalities and can provide useful information in breast imaging. Diagnostic ultrasound is also increasing in use for musculoskeletal imaging and it is capable of detecting tears or hypertrophy in some of the commonly injured and more superficial soft tissue structures. Superficial masses may also be initially evaluated by ultrasound. The large quantity of cartilage relative to bone in the pediatric skeleton, especially the very young, lends itself to evaluation by ultrasound. Diagnostic ultrasound of the adult spine is controversial due to a lack of consensus on normal versus abnormal findings. 51 Videofluoroscopy Videofluoroscopy (VF) is a modality that enables clinicians to view dynamic, real- time imaging of anatomy and function. VF is also a diagnostic test that can reliably record dynamic function of joints and their range of motion. [1], [2], [3], [4], [5] The role of VF has been well established in interventional radiology and in the evaluation of neuromusculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, myelographic, and other studies requiring the injection of contrast material. VF like other advanced imaging modalities is not typically utilized as an initial imaging procedure. It may be used as a follow-up to demonstrate abnormal joint mobility that is suspected clinically but not adequately substantiated by other diagnostic studies. [6], [7], [8] The value of VF, by comparison to static imaging modalities, is its ability to visualize the entire range and character of joint motion. [3], [4], [6], [9], [10], [11] The ability of VF to absolutely define segmental range of motion and the therapeutic significance of direct visualization of spinal dynamic function needs further investigation. [5] Practitioners utilizing VF must document clinical justification and be cognizant of its contraindications, and limitations. [12], [13], [14], [15] , [16] Specialized training is needed to adequately interpret the images acquired. Operators of this equipment must be knowledgeable in the basic concepts of radiobiology and fluoroscopy systems.

High quality radiographic images are essential to rule out pathology and evaluate structural alignment61. When radiographs are part of a biomechanical analysis it is paramount to evaluate images for pathologies that may weaken bony architecture, requiring modification of therapy62,63. Biomechanical analysis is used to determine misalignment, postural and motion abnormalities, and to guide manipulation. Many radiographic lines, angles, and measurements have been demonstrated to be reliable indicators of postural and biomechanical abnormalities. 32,37 Spinal Radiographic Analysis Most chiropractic methods of radiographic analysis have stressed the importance of assessing the patient in the upright, weight-bearing position . This allows for both full spine and regional postural evaluation. Specific consideration is given to the identification of abnormal spinal curves, that may compromise efficient biomechanical function. Studies that evaluate the reliability, validity and clinical relevance of radiographic line drawing have produced conflicting evidence.32,37 Reliability Reliability is the repeatability of a measurement and indicates consistency and precision when a procedure is done by different examiners and at multiple times.14 Factors that influence the reliability of spinal radiographic analysis include: anatomic variants, positioning of patient and x-ray equipment. In addition to these and other potential sources of systematic error, random measurement error adversely affects the reliability of measurement methods. While inter- examiner reliability of the actual marking of x-rays has been demonstrated 64-68, the reliability of the entire procedure has not been established. 14 Reliability does not establish the clinical relevance or validity of measurement procedures. Validity and Clinical Efficacy Validity refers to how accurately an assessment procedure measures, identifies or predicts the true state of the patient.69 While construct validity (a measure of the theoretical concept of x-ray line marking) has been evaluated,68 the predictive validity (the clinical relevance of x-ray line marking, i.e. can it identify current spine problems, predict future occurrences, or measure resolution) has not been established through well-designed clinical trials.70 Predictive validity is crucial; it is far more relevant than construct validity or reliability tests in establishing the clinical efficacy of assessment procedures Unless specifically indicated, this Educational Manual constitutes practice recommendations and not administrative rules. 18 Functional Radiographic Analysis Functional radiographs are practical tools for the evaluation of spinal segmental motion. Since Hviid71 in 1963, chiropractors including Sandoz,72 Anderson,73 West,73 Grice75 and Henderson advocated cervical templating techniques to determine hypomobility, hypermobility and instability of spinal motion segments. Functional radiographs may be used to evaluate the segmental range of motion by comparing the neutral position to the end range of movement in either the sagittal or coronal planes. Medical investigators, including Penning77 and Dvorak,38 have established normative values for gross segmental flexion and extension without reference to the neutral lateral view. However, clinical information may be lost when the information from the neutral position is not included in the assessment. The key to accurately evaluating motion on functional spinal radiographs is precise standards of patient positioning.60 Meticulous attention to the details of positioning cannot be overemphasized if the information obtained from the resultant radiographs is to be considered a reliable assessment of that particular patient's function.78 Functional radiographic studies have traditionally been performed with active movement by the patient. Dvorak et al38 emphasized the value of obtaining functional radiographic studies of the cervical spine both actively and passively. While they claim that many more hypermobile segments are discovered on the passive stress studies38 the application of force at the end of active range of motion risks injury to the patient. These systems of functional radiographic analysis may be of clinical value to the doctor of chiropractic who provides spinal manipulation/adjustments to specific levels of segmental dysfunction.32 The reliability38 and clinical validation79 of cervical flexion extension studies have been demonstrated. Full Spine Radiography Depending on history and clinical findings, the need for full spine radiography is based on the clinical judgment of the doctor. The choice of sectional or full spine views is dependent on clinical necessity and the ability to produce diagnostic quality radiographs. AP/PA full spine radiographs are used for evaluation of pathology and biomechanical analysis. Single exposure, lateral full spine radiographs are not recommended.63 The use of full spine radiographs is of value when clinical findings indicate the involvement of multiple spinal levels .63 Taylor32 has noted the following circumstances in which the PA full spine radiograph may be preferred over sectional radiographs: cases in which clinical examination disclosed the need for radiography of several spinal sections; cases in which severe postural distortions are evident, scoliosis evaluation after clinical assessment; cases in which a mechanical problem in one spinal area adversely affects other regions; to specifically evaluate complex biomechanical or postural disorders of the spine and pelvis under weight bearing conditions.32 Unless specifically indicated, this Educational Manual constitutes practice recommendations and not administrative rules. 19 Full spine radiographs can be considered to be of diagnostic quality80 with less radiation exposure to the patient compared to sectionals of the multiple levels involved This requires appropriate technology and technique with careful attention to exposure factors, film speed, and shielding.78,81,82 The evaluation of suspected pathology may require sectional or spot views to attain better detail.63Analysis of full spine radiographs has been used to identify biomechanical faults, chiropractic subluxations and joint dysfunction.. There is a variety of line marking systems used to evaluate radiographs. The validity and reliability of the full spine analytical systems has been studied with mixed results.63,83,84,85 PATIENT SAFETY Patient safety in diagnostic imaging encompasses a range of activities performed before, during and after the actual imaging exam. The primary goal of these efforts is to provide the most clinically significant information with the lowest possible risk and cost to the patient. 86,87,88 The following key areas should be addressed: patient education and informed consent (PARQ), patient comfort, selection criteria, radiation safety, image quality control, facilities maintenance and record keeping. Patient Education and Informed Consent (PARQ) The chiropractic physician should explain the diagnostic imaging procedures and follow up, the time and cost involved, risks and contraindications, and patient preparatory procedures. This should be done regardless of whether the treating physician will perform the imaging or order it from another facility. (See patient/doctor relationship chapter) Patient Comfort A clean, safe, comfortable environment should be provided for waiting, changing garments, securing personal items, and performing the imaging procedure. The privacy of the patient should be guarded during preparation for and execution of the exam, as well as with the storage of radiographs and reports. Radiation Safety The most important aspect of patient safety is to minimize the radiation dose to the patient. There is no known safe dose of ionizing radiation. Even the smallest dose can produce genetic damage. Diagnostic imaging doses do not typically produce clinical manifestations. The benefit to the patient must outweigh the risk.88-92As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA): Efforts should be made in all areas of the imaging procedure to provide the lowest possible dose to the patient without compromising image quality. 90 Unless specifically indicated, this Educational Manual constitutes practice recommendations and not administrative rules. 20 Patient Selection Criteria The planned diagnostic imaging procedures must supply significant clinical information that cannot be otherwise determined. If the diagnosis, treatment or prognosis will not likely change based on imaging findings, the imaging is not appropriate. Every exposure, including post- treatment exposures and scanograms, must have clinical justification with adequate documentation consistent with the patient's case history. 93 Chiropractic physicians are responsible for ordering necessary and appropriate imaging studies. More than one study may be indicated to fully evaluate a patient. Pre-existing x-ray studies should be accessed if possible. These may be repeated if timely access is not feasible, they are of poor quality or are not clinically relevant. Consultation with a radiologist may be helpful in determining which studies are most appropriate for a case. Image Quality Control Assurance of image quality and low patient dose is dependent on many equipment and procedure factors. Attention is required in the setup and maintenance of equipment as well as during the imaging procedures. 86,87,89,94 The following factors are listed as a guide for evaluating and monitoring plain film quality as it relates to patient safety. These should be considered to assure the highest possible film quality and lowest possible patient dose. Equipment Tables and film holders: stable, level, and plumb Control arm / tube holder: stable, locking mechanism for maintaining appropriate angle, markings for consistent and reproducible source image distance (SID) Collimation: accurate, centered, apparent on three sides X-ray tube and exposure controls: calibrated, current exposure charts Film/screen combinations: as fast as possible while maintaining adequate detail, screens clean and without defects, cassettes marked and without defects Markers: adequate to identify patient, anatomy, special procedures, proper placement Filters and shields: devices for reducing dose to sensitive tissues such as eye, thyroid gland, breast, and gonads should be available for frequently performed studies Processor: chemicals should be changed at prescribed intervals, processing temperature and speed consistently monitored Unless specifically indicated, this Educational Manual constitutes practice recommendations and not administrative rules. 21 Darkroom: film storage and handling should be safe from fogging factors Technique Technique charts: current and appropriate to the equipment; charts used consistently, factors recorded Positioning: standard and consistent positioning; options in positioning that may reduce dose employed (PA for full-spine; anode-heel effect).95,96 minimum diagnostic series to assure complete evaluation Patient prep: gown as appropriate, remove jewelry, dentures, other artifacts as appropriate Repeat films rates: monitored to identify problems Facilities Maintenance Equipment such as a floating tabletop, movable wall bucky, and the locking tube arm mechanism should be stable. Storage of chemicals should not pose a hazard to patients. Facilities should allow for adequate performance of chosen procedures. Room size should accommodate the longer source-image distance (SID) required of projections such as the lateral cervical spine and PA and lateral chest. A horizontal surface should be available to accommodate certain extremity studies, lumbar imaging on larger patients, and patients with difficulty remaining immobile.2 Referral may be necessary when facilities will not accommodate for special patient needs. Appropriate shielding should be utilized. Extremity and chest radiographs require specific film/screen combinations. Additional materials such as supports, weights and compression bands should be available. The patient should be referred to an appropriate facility if available equipment is not adequate to perform a chosen study. Test and evaluation procedures are recommended at given intervals. 93,96 (See Appendix A.) Record Keeping Following production and processing of radiographs, films should be checked for proper identification. (See Appendix B.) A written report should be generated that includes identifying information, the study performed, pertinent findings and a clinical impression. Optimally one copy of this should be kept with the films in addition to a copy that should be placed in the patient's file. Films should be stored in an area that provides for patient privacy and has physically appropriate conditions to protect film quality.86 Unless specifically indicated, this Educational Manual constitutes practice recommendations and not administrative rules. 22 Unless specifically indicated, this Educational Manual constitutes practice recommendations and not administrative rules. 23 References 1.

(New language is underlined, deleted language is struck through.) Supervision 811 -030-0011 Staff employees of a Doctor of Chiropractic may be directed to take X - rays of a patient if they are in possession of a permit issued by the State Board of Radiologic Technology, but this permit is limited only to the taking of X-rays. (ORS 684.155) Scope of Radiography in the Chiropractic Practice 811 -030-0020 (1) The radiographic diagnostic aspect of Chiropractic practice shall include all standard radiographic procedures that do not conflict with ORS 684.025. (2) All radiographs shall be of diagnostic quality. Radiographic films are subject to review by the Board to determine quality. Poor quality radiographs may result in disciplinary action. (3) X-ray is not to be used for therapeutic purposes. (4) Fluoroscopy shall not be used as a substitute for an initial radiographic study and shall be used only with documented clinical justification. In order for anyone to operate a fluoroscopy unit they must be properly trained and they must have written documentation that shows that these requirements are met. (OAR 333-106 -045) (5) Use of radio-opaque substances for diagnostic X-ray, other than by mouth or rectum, is not permitted. (6) Pregnant females shall not be radiographed unless the patient's symptoms are of such significance that the proper treatment of the patient might be jeopardized without the use of such radiographs. (7) All critical parts, i.e. fetus, eyes, thyroid gland, breasts and gonads, beyond the area of primary examination shall be shielded. (684.155 ) X-ray Departments, Equipment and Procedures 811 -030-0030 (1) All X-ray departments, equipment and procedures including fluoroscopy shall be in compliance with the current rules and regulations of the Oregon State Health Division Radiation Control Section, including but not limited to, the physical design of the department, occupational exposure, collimation, shielding and exposure charts and fluoroscopy. (2) In addition: (a) The patient shall be an adequate candidate for the radiographic or fluoroscopic procedure employed; (b) The radiographic field shall be restricted to the area of clinical interest; (c) Specialized views shall be used any time the area of clinical interest is not clearly visualized on a standard film; (d) Every exposure, including post-treatment exposures, and scanograms, shall have clinical justification with adequate documentation consistent with the patient's case history; (e) The operator shall maintain a record on each exposure of each patient containing the Unless specifically indicated, this Educational Manual constitutes practice recommendations and not administrative rules. 34 patient's name, the date, the operator's name or initials, the type of exposure and the radiation factors of time, mA, kVp and target film distance, including those exposures resulting in the necessity of repeat exposure for better diagnostic information such as patient motion or poor technical factors. For computerized and automated systems the recording of technique factors is not necessary as long as the equipment is calibrated and maintained. OAR 333- 106-045 requires the facility to determine the typical patient exposure for their most common radiographic examinations, i.e. technique chart. (f) Each film shall be properly identified by date of exposure, location of X-ray department, patient's name and number, patient's age, right or left marker and postural position marker; and indication of the position of the patient ; (g) The patient with tremors must be immobilized; (h) The radiographs of a patient with an antalgic posture may be taken in an upright position only if the patient is adequately supported and immobilized to insure diagnostic quality. Otherwise, the recumbent position shall be used; (i) Upright or postural views shall not be used for any patient whose size exceeds the capacity of the X-ray equipment. Penetration must be adequate on all films; (j) Full Spine (14 x 36 inch) radiographs: (A) Sectional views shall be taken in preference to a single 14 x 36 inch film if the patient's size or height prevents diagnostic qualify on a single 14 x 36 inch film; (B) (k) If two exposures are made on a single film, the area of exposure shall be critically collimated to avoid double exposure of the overlapping area; (C) (l) All views shall employ graduated filtration or adequate devices to attenuate the primary beam for the purpose of reducing unnecessary radiation and to improve film quality. Split screens, gradient or graded screens, paper light barriers inside the cassette, or any other attenuating device in the beam between the patient and the film shall not be permitted, other than the grid controlling scattered radiation. (k) (m) A record of radiographic findings on every set of radiographs reviewed shall be included in the patient's permanent file; (l) (n) Radiographs shall be kept and available for review for a minimum of seven years or until a minor becomes 18 years of age, whichever is longer. (ORS 441.059, 684.025, 684.150) Unless specifically indicated, this Educational Manual constitutes practice recommendations and not administrative rules. 35 STANDARDS In addition to the legal requirements for taking x-rays in the State of Oregon, the following standards shall apply: 1.

Section 1 INTRODUCTION The importance of keeping complete and accurate records cannot be overemphasized. Documentation of patient care is often as important as the rendition of care itself\" [1] Proper record keeping is the documentation of the patient-doctor interaction. This record should be constructed so that it may be understood by others necessary to support a patient's health and reimbursement needs. As a critical component of our health care delivery system, the accumulation of essential information, known as a patient record, serves many purposes, including: It provides a historical accounting of the patient's health concerns and treatments. While the actual record belongs to the provider, the information contained within the record belongs to the patient.[1] [3] Record keeping should facilitate and maintain communication between health care professionals. \"...clinicians must ensure that their documentation of a patient's health status is understood by other s on the health care team.\" 4 Each health care provider having access to that record has the same duty to record patient information and ensure that it is safeguarded.[1, 2, 4, 5] Quality record keeping allows a physician or reader to follow the conditions presented by the patient through the evolution of a diagnosis and treatment plan and the patient's response to the treatment.[5] The quality of the patient record may be considered a reflection of the quality of patient care. [1, 5] In the context of medico-legal concerns the record serves as the legal instrument to provide \"substantive evidence on whether care rendered met the legal standard of care.\"[1] \"... the courts side with whatever the patient has said ... 'If it's not in the chart, from a legal standpoint, either the procedure didn't happen or the comment wasn't made'.\"[6] The patient record documents the services provided allowing the physician to be properly reimbursed.[1, 2, 4, 5] \"It is often the quality of the documentation, rather than the condition of the patient, that determines the amount of care deemed medically necessary by the insurance company or auditors.\" [7] The record should include documentation of informed consent. Any limitations as requested by the patient should also be noted.[1] Patient records have also been used to evaluate physicians for the purposes of teaching, research, and to provide data for public health needs.[4, 5] The information in the record constitutes the foundation for writing accurate reports to health care providers, 3rd-party-payors, attorneys or any other interested parties. [1, 4] Unless specifically indicated, this Educational Manual constitutes practice recommendations and not administrative rule. As many health care systems grow, mature, and interrelate on an ever-increasing basis, the health care record becomes more and more important. \"Ultimately, good record keeping is a necessity. It is important to everyone: patient, doctor and staff.\"[2] Each physician has an ethical, as well as legal, duty [1] to construct these records in such a manner as to be accurate, legible, complete and organized. [1, 3, 4, 6] Finding ways and methods that allow for the most complete compilation of this essential data in a simple and easy manner is a frequent challenge. There are numerous forms and methods of record keeping available, including standard formats and other organizational systems used throughout healthcare fields.[1] Each doctor may standardize files in the way best suited to each particular practice. SOAP format is recommended.[7] \"Good decisions are often the result of accurate and complete facts being retrievable from a patient record.\" [7, 8] Unless specifically indicated, this Educational Manual constitutes practice recommendations and not administrative rule. Section 2 RECORD KEEPING \"Each patient shall have exclusive records which shall be sufficiently detailed and legible as to allow any other chiropractic physician to understand the nature of that patient's case and to be able to follow up with the care of that patient if necessary.\" \"It will be considered unprofessional conduct not to keep complete and accurat e records on all patients, including but not limited to case histories, examinations, diagnostic and therapeutic services, treatment plan, instructions in home treatment and supplements, work status information and referral recommendations.\" Oregon Admini strative Rule 811-015-0005(1) INTERNAL DOCUMENTATION Patient record Information contained in the patient file is the foundation of the patient's permanent record. Each page in the patient file shall contain the patient's name and/or ID number [1] The following additional information shall also be included in the patient file /s: Patient identification/pertinent demographic information [4, 9- 9-11] Examination findings [4, 10] and study findings [4, 9-11] Diagnoses 9-11] Treatment plan[4, 9, 9-11] Insurance and billing information [4, 9, 1 0] Consent documentation [4, 9, 10] Reports and other correspondence[4, 9, 10] Referring physicians [4, 9, 10, 12] Often, the patient record is stored in a folder. The folder itself may also become part of the record if the practitioner writes patient data on the folder, such as personal information, treatment plan, diagnoses, etc.;[4] however, care should be taken to comply with patient privacy laws (e.g. HIPAA). Outdated portions of the patient record may be removed and stored in an archive file. If this is done, a note should be kept in the active file identifying the location of those records. [4, 9, 10] Doctor/clinic identification Basic information identifying the practitioner and/or clinic should appear on each page of documentation. [4, 9, 10] This information should include: Practitioner's name and professional degree [4, 10] Facility name (if different ) [4, 10] Street address and mailing address (if different) [4, 10] Unless specifically indicated, this Educational Manual constitutes practice recommendations and not administrative rule. Telephone numbers [4, 10] Patient identification The record shall clearly identify each patient. [1, 5, 6] This information is often obtained by using preprinted forms that are completed by the patient and may include the following: Name (prior/other names) [4, 10] 10] [4, 10] consenting parent or guardian (when applicable) [4, 10] Letter of guardianship (when applicable) 10] Emergency contact name/number [4, 10] Photographs Patient case history A detailed case history is an important part of the patient record as it is the foundation of the clinical database for that patient. [4, 10] This information should include an adequate description of the patient's perception of their history. [4, 10] History questionnaires, drawings and other information completed by the patient should be included in the patient record. [4, 10] Elements of the patient history may include the following: Presenting or chief complaint [4, 9, 10] Date or time of onset of symptoms [4, 9, 10] Description of accident or injury (if applicable) [4, 9] Past and present health history [4, 9, 10] Family and social history [4, 9, 10] Systems review (as appropriate) [4, 9, 10] Past and present therapeutic and diagnostic procedures [4, 9, 10] Signature of person eliciting history [4, 10] Examination findings The results of all examination procedures performed, ordered or requisitioned must be recorded and will become part of the permanent patient record. [4, 9, 10] Objective information is obtained by a physical examination/assessment of the area of complaint and related areas and/or systems. Preprinted and formatted examination forms may be used to facilitate the gathering and recording of this information.[4, 10] Unless specifically indicated, this Educational Manual constitutes practice recommendations and not administrative rule. Documentation should include the date of the examination and the name or initials of the examining practitioner. [4, 10] If abbreviations are used, a legend should be available. [4, 10] The examination and diagnostic procedures may include the following: A. Physical examination Vital signs [4, 8, 10] Heart, lung and abdomen [8] EENT Chiropractic, orthopedic [4, 8, 10] Static and motion palpation of spine and extremities [8] Postural analysis [8] Muscle testing including dynamic, isokinetic, static and manual [8] Functional examination [13] Other B. Diagnostic Imaging Plain scan [8] Other Reports with clinical findings should be reviewed, initialed, and dated upon receipt. [4, 9, 10] Regarding radiographic examinations, \"The operator shall maintain a record on each exposure of each patient containing the patient's name, the date, the operator's name or initials, the type of exposure and the radiation factors of time, mA, kVp and target film distance, including those exposures resulting in the necessity of repeat exposure for better diagnostic informatio n such as patient motion or poor technical factors\" [14] Unless specifically indicated, this Educational Manual constitutes practice recommendations and not administrative rule. For computerized and automated systems the recording of technique factors is not necessary as long as the equipment is calibrated and maintained. OAR 333-106 - 0045 requires the facility to determine the typical patient exposure for their most common radiographic examinations (i.e. technique chart). \"Each film shall be properly identified by date of exposure, location of X -ray department, patient's name or number, patient's age, right or left marker and postural position marker.\" [14] C. Laboratory Results of laboratory exams ordered or performed by the physician may include: Complete blood count[4] Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate[4] Urinalysis[4] Chemistry Screen [4] Other Reports with clinical findings should be reviewed, initialed, and dated upon receipt. [4, 9, 10] D. Special Examinations Results of special exams ordered or performed by the physician may include: Gynecological examination [8] Proctological evaluation [8] Psycho-social assessment Testicular Other Reports with clinical findings should be reviewed, initialed, and dated upon receipt. [4, 9, 10] Clinical impression or diagnosis Upon the completion and assessment of the patient's history, subjective complaints, and examination findings, the physician arrives at a clinical impression or diagnosis. The clinical impression or diagnosis must be recorded within the record. [4, 10, 15] Since they may change with new clinical information, time and treatment, it is important that the clinical impression or diagnosis be dated.[4, 10] It is not necessary to update this category at each visit, but periodic re-examinations should be performed and the results included in the record along with any change in the clinical impression or diagnosis. [8] Unless specifically indicated, this Educational Manual constitutes practice recommendations and not administrative rule. Accur ate recording of the patient's condition frequently requires more than one diagnosis. Of particular concern to the chiropractic practitioner is identification of the biomechanical lesion (subluxation/segmental dysfunction). Recording this information documents the spinal region involved and is the basis for the adjustment/manipulation that is emphasized in chiropractic practice. In addition, the pathoanatomic diagnosis gives the location and severity of specific structures damaged and helps to formulate the prognosis for the patient's condition. A patient may have only a pathoanatomical lesion or only a biomechanical (functional) lesion. However, the biomechanical lesion is most often linked to a pathoanatomical condition. [16] Components of the clinical impression/diagnosis may include: Phase of lesion [8] (e.g. acute, subacute, chronic, acute recurrent, chronic recurrent) Severity [4, 8] (e.g. mild, moderate, severe, Grade I, II, III) Mechanism of lesion [8] (e.g. traumatic, postural, overuse, hyperextension, torsional) Location [4, 8] (e.g. spinal level, muscle, ligament, neurological structures) Type of lesion (e.g. sprain, strain, subluxation, myofascitis, DJD) Neurological involvement (e.g. nerve root involvement, distribution, site of nerve root or cord compression/irritation) Complicating/associated factors [4, 8] (e.g. neurological involvement, DJD, stenosis) Resulting anatomical damage or syndrome (e.g. cervicogenic headache, facet syndrome) Concomitant pathological diagnoses [4] (e.g. COPD, neoplasm, CHF, HTN) Treatment plan The treatment plan is the portion of the patient record that deals with the proposed action by either the treating physician or the patient.[17] The plan arises from the accumulation of clinical data and the initial clinical impression or diagnosis.[4, 10] The treatment plan must be recorded in the patient file. The treatment plan should include, when applicable: The prescribed therapeutic treatment plan (including modes, frequency and duration of care) [4, 10, 17] Additional diagnostic testing recommended or being considered [4, 10] Reassessment schedule [4, 10] Patient education and self-care [4, 10, 17] Referrals or consultations [4, 10, 17] Goals and outcome measures Chart/progress notes \"Every page of chart notes will identify the patient by name, and the clinic of origin by name and address. Each entry will be identified by da y, month, year, provider of service and author of the record.\"[3] Oregon Administrative Rule 811-015 -0005(1)(b) Chart notes (often referred to as progress notes) are made in a patient's chart to record the patient's state of health, what transpired during patient visits as well as any significant changes in the clinical picture, assessment or treatment plan.[4, 8, 10] Chart notes should document the patient's response to the physician's management of their case. All record should be made in a systematic and organized manner [4, 8, 10] The Unless specifically indicated, this Educational Manual constitutes practice recommendations and not administrative rule. record shall be legible and clear enough to allow a peer to assume management of the case after an initial review of the chart notes.[1, 8] Since the 1970s the classic format has been known as \"S.O.A.P.\" notes.[17] S.O.A.P. is an acronym for Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan or Procedures.[7] This pertinent clinical information can be organized in the SOAP format in a variety of ways. While full S.O.A.P. charting at each visit is strongly recommended, it is not required. Components of the record should include: [8] Subjective complaints: These should be in the patient's own words when possible, indicating improvement, worsening or no change. [8] Objective findings: Changes in the clinical signs of a condition should be noted at each visit in the doctor's own words. [8] Assessment or diagnosis: It is not necessary to update this category at each visit. However, periodic clinical reevaluations should be performed and these results included in the daily entries with any modification of the diagnosis. [18] Plan of Management: A provisional plan of management should be recorded initially and further entries made as this plan is modified and/or as a patient enters a new phase of treatment. Changes in procedures should be noted. [18] Daily recording of procedures performed should include adjustment/manipulat ion performed (for example, direction and force of the thrust), soft tissue techniques, modalities used (including time, location and intensity), exercises prescribed, nutritional supplementation or prescribed diet and activity instructions or advice. Any significant adverse response to therapies should be noted. [18] Financial records Financial records may be kept in the patient record and may include the following: Patient account ledgers (including date and type of services billed, payments received and from which source, account balance) [4, 15] Billing statements [4] Insurance records (explanation of benefits, proof of payment, etc.) [4] Internal memoranda regarding patient Internal memoranda regarding individual patients should be kept in the patient record and may include the following: Intra-office staff messages [4] Phone messages and/or summaries of phone conversations [4] Copies of emails sent/received [4] Copies of sign -in sheets [4] Any correspondence sent out of the treating practitioner's office should contain the doctor and clinic name and address, phone number and current date. [19] Unless specifically indicated, this Educational Manual constitutes practice recommendations and not administrative rule. Electronic records The computerization of the medical record has accelerated rapidly in recent years. The use of electronic or computer -assisted record keeping systems is becoming more common in chiropractic offices. These systems may include computer-assisted writing, voice recognition or other developing technologies. [17] Some systems accept input not only from the computer keyboard, but from touch screens, light pens, scanners and other input devices. [17] If an electronic record-keeping system is used, the provider needs to take reasonable steps to ensure the system is so designed and operated that the record is secure from loss, tampering, interference or unauthorized use or access and complies with all state and federal confidentiality regulations. EXTERNAL DOCUMENTATION External documentation includes relevant information received from an outside source and may include correspondence from numerous sources: referring physicians, other previous/concurrent practitioners, attorneys, various pay groups, consultative reports, diagnostic studies, etc. The original of each of thos e relevant external documents, if available, should be kept in that patient's record. [4, 10, 19] Any external clinical documents such as reports or diagnostic studies should be initialed, dated and included in the patient's file. This notation provides evidence that the document has been read by the doctor. [1, 3] CHART/FILE ORGANIZATION General Records should be entered in the sequence events took place, and kept in chronological order.[4] Records should be neat, legible, organized and complete, and recorded in dark ink or other permanently retrievable method within 24 hours of occurrence. [1, 4, 9, 20] The record should never be backdated, erased, deleted or altered in any way. [4, 21] If corrections need to be made, a line should be drawn through the error and the change initialed and dated.[4, 15] If records are kept electronically, amendments should be made in such a way that preserves the original record. Records must be complete enough to provide the practitioner with enough information for subsequent care or reporting to outside parties. [4] Preprinted Forms Forms may be used based on the practitioner's discretion. Forms provide an orderly means of obtaining the history, noting examination findings and charting progress.[4] If preprinted forms are used, they should include appropriate doctor/clinic identification.[6, 22]If part of a form does not apply to a practitioner's practice, the section should be deleted and the form reprinted.[23] Abbreviations/Symbols \"Recordable abbreviations and terminology should be internally consistent and a key for these abbreviations must be availabl e.\" [9] All records sent to a third party should be accompanied by a legend of codes or abbreviations used.[1, 6, 20, 23] Unless specifically indicated, this Educational Manual constitutes practice recommendations and not administrative rule. MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS Oregon Administrative Rules Records 811-015 -0005 (1) It will be considered unprofessional conduct not to keep complete and accurate records on all patients, including but not limited to case histories, examinations, diagnostic and therapeutic services, treatment plan, instructions in home treatment and supplements, work status information and referral recommendations. 811-015 -0005 (3) A patient's records shall be kept by the Chiropractic physician a minimum of seven years. If the patient is a minor, the records shall be kept seven years or until the patient is 18 years of age, whichever is longer.[24] Disclosure of Records 811-015 -0006 (1) A Chiropractic physician shall make available within a reasonable time to a patient or a third party upon the patient's written request, copies or summaries of medical records and originals or copies of the patient's X -rays. (a) The medical records do not necessarily include the personal office notes of the Chiropractic physician or personal communications between a referring and consulting physician relating to the patient. (b) The Chiropractic physician shall preserve a patient's medical records from disclosure a nd will release them only on a patient's written consent stating to whom the records are being released or as required by State and Federal law. (2) The Chiropractic physician may establish a reasonable charge to the patient for the costs incurred in providing the patient with copies of any portion of the medical records. A patient shall not be denied summaries or copies of his/her medical records or X-rays because of inability to pay or financial indebtedness to the Chiropractic physician.[25] Confidentiality All patient/doctor communications and interactions are privileged and confidential. This is an ethical responsibility as well as a statutory and/or regulatory one. [4, 10, 15] All information regarding a patient must be kept confidential unless its release is authorized by the patient or is compelled by law. Assurance of confidentiality is necessary if patients are to be open and forthright with the practitioner. Patients have the right to expect that information regarding their health will remain private and secure from public scrutiny.[4, 10, 26]The unauthorized disclosure of patient records by a physician may create legal liability unless the disclosure is to an authorized source, authorized by law, or justified by a superior public interest.[27] A patient who is injured by disclosure of his or her confidential information may pursue legal remedies against the providers not only for breach of privacy, but also for breach of implied contract of confidentiality, malpractice and/or infliction of emotional distress.[26] The doctor is responsible for staff actions regarding record keeping. Any employee involved in the preparation, organization, filing, or discussion of records should fully understand professional and legal requirements, including the rules of confidentiality. [4, 10, 28] Unless specifically indicated, this Educational Manual constitutes practice recommendations and not administrative rule. Records Retention and Retrieval Health records should be retained in a way that facilitates retrieval. To the extent possible, they should be kept in a centralized location. In most circumstances, recent records are maintained on premises either as hard copy or electronically. After a period of time they can be archived, microfilmed or microfiched and placed in storage.[4, 10] While there are administrative rules governing the length of time that records must be kept, from a patient and risk management perspective, it is desirable for all records to be retained indefinitely by the physician. [26],[29] If a chiropractic office closes or changes ownership, secure retention of the health care record must be ensured. Arrangements should be made through wills or estate plans for the orderly transfer of patient records to another doctor or to a special administrator or caretaker of the records.[22] If health records are to be destroyed, they must be disposed of in a manner protective of patient confidentiality. Administrative Records Administrative records are primarily those relating to the non-clinical side of practice, and may include telephone logs, schedules and appointment records, patient personal information, insurance forms and billing documents. These records can be kept separately from the patient file, but they must be maintained in a legible and retrievable form. [4, 10] Records Transfer It is mandatory that health care data requested by another provider currently treating a present or former patient be forwarded upon receipt of an appropriate request and patient consent.[4, 9, 10] When responding to a request for patient records, determine whether all or only part of the record is requested. If the nature of the request is not clear, an inquiry to the person making the request will usually clear up what material is required. A subpoena asking for \"all medical records pertaining to the care and treatment of 'patient x' between January and June 1995\" means that the physician is to produce all medical records for 'patient x' between those dates regardless of the source. A request for \"all records documenting your care and treatment of 'patient x' means all records of the physician's own care, not someone else's. [30] Electronic Records When records are kept electronically, they must be protected by proper back-up, firewall and confidentiality/security procedures. Increased use of electronic mail, the Internet and remote access creates new opportunities for tampering. This may result in errors of data identification, authentication, availability, and integrity. Availability refers to the ability of an authorized user to access the medical information. Integrity describes the system's capability to prevent outsiders and/or unauthorized insiders from altering data and unauthorized access. The federal laws that are most relevant to electronic communications include the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 (ECPA), 18 U.S.C. 2510 et seq., and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), 42 U.S.C. 1320d. HIPAA requires health care providers and health plans to \"maintain reasonable and appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards (a) to ensure confidentiality of the information, and (b) protect against (i) threats or hazards to the securit y of the information; and (ii) unauthorized uses or disclosures of this information.\" [28] Chiropractic Records Ownership Management and Responsibility Unless specifically indicated, this Educational Manual constitutes practice recommendations and not administrative rule. The content of the medical record is owned by the patient; however, the physician has the obligation to maintain the record intact for the use of the patient and to copy it upon request.[30] Upon receipt of a properly executed release of records request, a chiropractic physician shall make available copies or summaries of medical records to the patient or third party within a reasonable time.[25] Although Oregon Law allows release of records under certain circumstances without patient approval,[31] it is strongly recommended prior to release of any records, a properly executed authorization be in place for the full protection of the patient and physician. When a practice is closed, sold or there is a transfer of ownership, secure retention of the records must be ensured.[4] If a single physician's office is closed, that physician remains responsible for maintenance of records for a minimum period of time, i.e. for adults seven years or for a minor patient, seven years or to the age of 18 whichever is longer.[24] In the case of a group practice closure, the issue of record keeping/maintenance may be dealt with by a contractual agreement.[32] File transfers resulting from the sale/purchase of a practice must follow statute, regulations and policies to ascertain whether a patient authorization is required at the time of the file transfer.[32] If the seller does not keep a copy of the files, the contract/agreement covering the transaction should impose an obligation upon the purchaser to maintain the records and allow access to them by the seller in order to satisfy their professional obligations.[32] Management of healthcare records in a single physician's office is a relat ively straightforward situation where that physician is responsible for all aspects of records management. A more complex set of circumstances occurs when considering records management within the context of a multiple physician/group practice where dissolution, sale, closure or other change is taking place. Many of the potential difficulties with respect to maintenance of records in this type of situation can be avoided with proper contractual arrangements established at the outset of the relationship.[32] Contracts should anticipate the necessity for providing the physician with copies and should establish whose duty it is to provide and pay for duplication.[30] If physicians choose not to retain copies, a release should be obtained from each patient involved guaranteeing access to the records in the future, should the need arise.[30] Keeping a copy of all records after dissolution of a contractual relationship is expensive but vital.[30] Virtually all state disciplinary actions and malpractice suits turn on the content of the record.[30] The physician who does not maintain custody is at the mercy of the others who may lose, alter or attempt to deny access to records essential to their own defense.[30] Perhaps the best way for the physician to ensure access to the records (e.g. employment contracts, managed care groups, nursing homes, etc.) is to have the patient sign a release (preferably at the initial visit) entitling the physician to obtain complete copies of any medical records containing information related to that physician' s care of the patient.[30] Within the context of a physician leaving a practice, the dissolution of a group practice, or an associate physician arrangement, there are several different scenarios that require further discussion with respect to records management. If a patient has been seen by more than one physician, the original file or a copy should be maintained at the clinic.[32] If the original file is removed, a signed, dated authorization form should be received from the patient directing that file be provided to a specific practitioner. [32] If the patient has been seen only by the remaining physician/s, a copy may be provided to the departing physician with a signed, dated authorization form. [32] Unless specifically indicated, this Educational Manual constitutes practice recommendations and not administrative rule. If the patient has been seen only by the departing physician/s, no consent form is necessary to remove the file unless the file was opened in the name of a group practice or there is a separate agreement stating all records are the property of the clinic. [32] In this case, a copy or the original should be maintained at the clinic and a written authorization for transfer of records out of the facility is required. [32] With respect to files where radiographs are involved, due to the costly nature of reproduction, the original films should be kept as part of the original file. [32] When a practice facility changes status, e.g. purchase/sale, dissolution of a contractual relationship, etc. the most vital concerns with respect to records management are maintenance of privacy/confidentiality and ensuring intact records are readily accessible for the benefit of the patient/s healthcare. In a multi- physician/group practice, an explicit contract defining the responsibilities of all parties involved is a critical component of ensuring proper maintenance of records. PATIENT CONSENTS Informed consent must be recorded for evaluation and treatment, treating a minor, obtaining or releasing health records, taking and releasing photos or videos, participation in research or inclusion in publication.[12] The original of any signed written form regarding these consent issues belongs in the patient file. While legal experts are strong advocates of written consent forms, [4], [10] doctors are reminded that forms may not provide full protection against lawsuits.[33] [17] Whether written or verbal, informed consent for evaluation and treatment should include a discussion with the patient and should be documented as a PARQ conference. For further discussion of informed consent including the PAR/PARQ notation, refer to the Patient/Doctor Relationship Chapter. Written forms for the release or procurement of health records are required. Written forms for permission to treat a minor are recommended. [17, 34] If a second doctor observes and/or treats the patient, a second consent is necessary. [33] MALPRACTICE TIPS Today's practice environment requires careful documentation of patient care. [35] The patient as a plaintiff has the burden of proving that a health care professional has acted negligently.[36] The most useful factor defending against an accusation of malpractice is the record,[6] and risk -management is the best line of defense. [6, 36] Patient records allow the professional to show that proper rather than negligent care was provided. [36] , [23] The legal definition of malpractice includes four criteria:[6] 1) There must be a duty between the two parties, i.e. a patient/doctor relationship.[3] 2) There must be a breach of that duty, i.e. something wrong has to have occurred between the two parties.[3] Unless specifically indicated, this Educational Manual constitutes practice recommendations and not administrative rule. (Note: Anger toward the doctor is the most frequent instigating factor.[6]) 3) Harm or injury must result from that breach of duty. [6] 4) There has to be 'proximate cause', i.e. a relationship in time between the breach and the injury. [6] If a lawsuit occurs and the patient file (including all billings[6]) cannot be provided or is incomplete, inaccurate or illegible [23], the doctor could be found liable even though not at fault. [6] If documents are lost and not included or billings are not provided (even though the doctor may have not known they needed to be included), the doctor's credibility may be compromised. ) In the event a potential malpractice situation actually does occur, the chiropractic physician should stay calm and act responsibly. The physician should avoid repeating the procedure, monitor the patient, follow any risk-management procedures as outlined by your insurance company and document the incident. The chiropractic physician should contact legal counsel prior to meeting with the plaintiff(s) and/or their attorneys. [6] The following is a list of suggestions, habits and/or risk-management techniques that create good patient records: Stay within licensure boundaries.[22] o (See the Chapter 811 Oregon Administrative Rules for those details.) Explain procedures and treatments as care proceeds.

Section 3 HIPAA - HEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 1996 The following material is a summary of Federal Law. With the advent and extensive use of electronic media in the health care realm, there is a greater possibility of widespread dissemination a nd abuse of a patient's Protected Health Information (PHI). \"Protected Health Information means individually identifiable health information created, maintained or in the possession of our practice relating to the past, present or future physical or mental health of any individual, the provision of health care to an individual, or the past, present or future payment for the provision of health care to an individual.\" [41] Even if the information provides a reasonable basis to believe it can be used to identify an individual, it is considered individually identifiable health information. [42] In August 1996 the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) bill was passed giving the Federal Government the ability to regulate how covered entities (health care plans, providers, and clearing houses) use, store, disclose and transmit Protected Health Information. Prior to the passage of HIPAA there were no national or industry standards mandating or regulating the privacy and confidentiality of a patient's PHI. Individual states had a variety of rulings rel ated to patient privacy and disclosure of PHI that were very often disjointed and incomplete. HIPAA provides national standards for the protection and security of one's PHI, while improving the efficacy of healthcare provision by providing standards for t ransmitting patient's financial information to which all covered entities must adhere. The Privacy Rule holds violators accountable by imposing civil and criminal penalties HIPAA generally encompasses two rules- The Privacy Rule and the Security Standard. The Privacy Rule, (Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information), regulates the use and disclosure of PHI and encompasses three essential purposes. The first purpose is to protect the rights of patients by providing them access to their PHI and the ability to control the use and disclosure of it. The second purpose is to restore public trust in the healthcare delivery system, and the third is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare delivery in the US by creating a national framework of healthcare privacy. [43] The Privacy Rule provides the first national standards for protecting the privacy of health information. It mandates how covered entities (healthcare plans, providers, and clearing houses) use, store, disclose, and transmit PHI. It sets boundaries on the use and disclosure of medical records, by requiring safeguards that most healthcare entities must provide to protect the privacy of health information. It encompasses the practitioner's use of the patients' PHI within their office or health care setting and the disclosu re of PHI outside of the office setting. It states that protected health information can only be used and disclosed for treatment, payment, or healthcare operations without a patient authorization. Any other uses require a patient authorization prior to the PHI being released. The rule also generally limits the release of information to the minimum necessary for the purpose of the disclosure so that irrelevant information is not released unnecessarily. This limitation of only releasing the minimum necessary information does not apply when the PHI is disclosed to another practitioner for direct treatment purposes. The rules make allowances with public health responsibilities as well to allow the collection of information used to prevent or control disease, injury, disability, including public health surveillance, investigation and intervention. Unless specifically indicated, this Educational Manual constitutes practice recommendations and not administrative rule. The HIPAA limitations do not apply to information that is de-identified so that the patient can not be connected with their PHI. The following is a table listing what is considered identifiable information: Identifiable Information 1. Name 2. Any address specification such as street, city, county, precinct, and zip code 3. All dates except for the year including birthdates, admission date, discharge date, date of death and all ages over 89 4. Telephone number 5. Fax number 6. Electronic mail address 7. Social Security number 8. Medical record number 9. Health plan beneficiary number 10. Account number maintained by the healthcare provider 11. Certificate or license number such as driver's license num ber 12. Vehicle identifier and serial number including license plate number 13. Medical device identifier and serial number such as pace maker serial number 14. Web site address 15. Internet protocol (IP) address number 16. Biometric identifier including finger and voice prin ts 17. Full face photographic images and any comparable image, and 18. Any other unique identifying number characteristic or code Table courtesy of HIPAA Privacy Manual A how-to Guide for Your Medical Practice 2nd Edition. Developed by Gates, Moore & Co. for The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. 2002 Beyond limiting the practitioner's ability to use or disclose PHI without a patient's authorization, the Privacy Rule empowers patients to have more control over their health information. The first step in providing the patient with more control is the mandatory requirement of each health care provider to provide the patient with a copy of the \"Notice of Privacy Practices.\" If the initial contact with a patient is electronic, then an electronic copy of the Notice of Privacy Practices must be provided at that time. The Notice of Privacy Practices outlines the patient's rights to privacy and how personal health information will be routinely used for treatment, payment and healthcare operations within the healthcare setting. The provider must also obtain a written acknowledgment from the patient that a copy of the notice was received. [44] Release of PHI for purposes other than treatment, payment or healthcare operations requires a signed authorization from the patient. This allows patients to make informed choices about how their individual health information may be used and/or disclosed. The HIPAA privacy rules go beyond requiring an authorization for release of information by requiring tracking what disclosures of PHI have been made. This enables patients to find out how their health information has been used or released. The patient also has the right to obtain a copy of their medical record and can review and correct or amend the PHI. There must be policies and procedures in place for patient review, correction or amendment of their PHI. The provider is not required to change medical records at the request of the patient, but they should be able to link the amended information to the original chart. Corrections or amendments to the health record requested by the pati ent can only be made with their physician's approval. Unless specifically indicated, this Educational Manual constitutes practice recommendations and not administrative rule. To assure that the HIPAA privacy rules are enforced, health care providers are required to designate a privacy officer within the clinic. This person is responsible for implementing the privacy rules. There should also be a designated contact person, who may be the same individual, to receive complaints and provide information to the public related to the privacy policies. The final piece of the privacy rules relates to the need for staff education related to patient privacy and their responsibilities to comply with the HIPAA regulations. There should be documented education with all staff and appropriate policies and procedures in place to demonstrate that the office is doing their due diligence i n assuring that the patient's privacy is maintained. The office should also look at their routine operations and make a concerted effort to minimize the chance for inadvertent disclosure of PHI due to processes in place such as leaving patient records in plain sight at the receptionist's desk or having computer screens with PHI easily visible in areas where patients are present. The other rule HIPAA encompasses is the Security Rule which is composed of two major standards; the security standard and the electronic signature standard [45] The Security Standard requires a secure electronic environment in which a covered entity would maintain, store, or transmit all PHI. The rule defines and requires a secure electronic environment as; an environment with physical, procedural, technical and administrative procedures, services, and mechanisms. What is a Secure Electronic Environment? A Secure Electronic Environment is an environment that has administrative procedures, physical safeguard and technical security services and mechanisms in place. It also include s the implementation of an electronic signature standard if the practice uses an electronic signature. Administrative Procedures are formal, documented practices to protect PHI. This includes the selection and execution of security measures and the manag ement of personnel as it relates to protecting PHI. Physical Safeguards are procedures to protect computer systems, buildings and other equipment from fire and other natural and environmental hazards, as well as from intrusion. Technical Security Service s are processes that are implemented to control and monitor access to PHI such as passwords. Technical Security Mechanisms are processes implemented to prevent unauthorized access to data that is transmitted over a communications network (Internet, Intran et, fax machine, etc.) Table courtesy of HIPAA Privacy Manual A how-to Guide for Your Medical Practice 2nd Edition. Developed by Gates, Moore & Co. for The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. 2002 The Electronic Signature Standard Unless specifically indicated, this Educational Manual constitutes practice recommendations and not administrative rule. An electronic signature is a data component that is incorporated into an electronic document for the purpose of uniquely identifying the signer. Practices are not required to use electronic signatures, however if a provider uses electronic signatures, then the Security Standard Rule requires that HIPAA signature standards be used to verify the identity of the message sender, or the signer of a document. [46] With the implementation of HIPAA regulation, the government has imposed national rules and standards that will greatly improve the security of a patient's protected health information, while giving them more control over where and how it can be used. Securing and standardizing the electronic environment will greatly expedite and secure the transfer of data and Protected Health Information. Unless specifically indicated, this Educational Manual constitutes practice recommendations and not administrative rule. Section 4 PRACTICE STANDARDS 1. The content of the medical record is owned by the patient; however, the physician has the obligation to maintain the record intact for the use of the patient and to copy it upon request.30 2. Upon receipt of a properly executed release of records request, a chiropractic physician shall make available copies or summaries of medical records to the patient or third party within a reasonable time.25 3. Clinicians must ensure that their documentation of a patient's health status is understandable by others on the health care team. 4 4. The patient record must include documentation of informed consent. 5. Whether written or verbal, informed consent for evaluation and treatment should include a discussion with the patient and should be documented as a PARQ conference. 6. Recordable abbreviations and terminology should be internally consistent and a key for these abbreviations must be available upon request.9 7. The record should never be backdated, erased, deleted or altered in any way.4,21 If corrections need to be made, a line should be drawn through the error and the change initialed and dated.4,15 If records are kept electronically, amendments should be made in such a way that preserves the original record. 8. All information regarding a patient must be kept confidential unless its release is authorized by the patient or is compelled by law. 9.
