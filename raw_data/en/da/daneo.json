An integrative detoxification session with us might be just what you need for overall wellness. Here's what you should know about detoxification. What is Detoxification? Detoxification is defined as the process of removing unwanted substances from your body. These can be physical, as in the case of toxins, but they can also be harmful emotions and behaviors that negatively affect your body, causing stress and decreasing your quality of life. Certified practitioners of integrative medicine believe that the following symptoms arise when your body is unable to detox itself naturally: - fatigue - memory problems - increase in anxiety and depression - muscle aches - irritable bowel syndrome - headaches and chronic muscle pain - changes in your weight - bloating - sinus congestion - skin rashes What Are the Benefits of Detoxification? There are multiple benefits to undergoing detoxification. As we've already mentioned, a detoxification session may be necessary for you if your body is not able to naturally detox itself from toxins or you notice a change in your emotional and mental health. Research indicates that detoxification has been successfully used to treat patients with: - Gastrointestinal disorders - Fibromyalgia - Depression - Endocrine disorders - Menopause - PMS - Autoimmune diseases - Inflammation - Chronic fatigue syndrome What Are the Types of Integrative Detoxification Therapies An integrative approach to detoxification involves non-narcotic and non-invasive procedures to improve your quality of life. This can include: - hydrotherapy - herbal supplements - naturopathy - changes to diet and lifestyle - ayurveda - acupuncture - yoga - meditation What to Expect During a Detoxification Session If you've never had a detoxification session before, you might be wondering what to expect during your first appointment. A licensed practitioner at Officite Demo Pt/Pain Management will begin by asking a comprehensive set of questions to determine your current health, mental, and emotional well-being included. As every patient's symptoms are different, the treatment recommended will be individualized and differ from one patient to the next.
