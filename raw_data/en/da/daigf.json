Etiology of Female Orgasmic Disorder Factors that contribute to female orgasmic disorder include Contextual factors (eg, consistently insufficient foreplay, early ejaculation by the partner, poor communication about sexual preferences) Psychological factors (eg, anxiety, stress, lack of trust in a partner) Cultural factors (eg, lack of recognition of or attention paid to female sexual pleasure) Medications (eg. some antipsychotics or, commonly, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]) Lack of knowledge about sexual function Damage to genital sensory or autonomic nerves or pathways (eg, due to diabetes or multiple sclerosis) Vulval dystrophy (eg, lichen sclerosus) Symptoms and Signs of Female Orgasmic Disorder Women with orgasmic disorder may have other types of sexual dysfunction (eg, dyspareunia, pelvic floor dysfunction). Anxiety disorders and depression are also more common among women with this disorder. Diagnosis of Female Orgasmic Disorder Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR) criteria ( [1](/professional/gynecology-and-obstetrics/female-sexual-function-and-dysfunction/female-orgasmic-disorder#v82330386) [Diagnosis reference Female orgasmic disorder involves orgasm that is absent, infrequent, markedly diminished in intensity, or markedly delayed in response to stimulation despite normal levels of subjective arousal... read more](/professional/gynecology-and-obstetrics/female-sexual-function-and-dysfunction/female-orgasmic-disorder#v82330386)) Clinicians interview the woman and, sometimes, her partner; the woman is asked to describe the problem in her own words and should include specific elements (see table ). Diagnosis of orgasmic disorder is clinical, based on criteria in the DSM-5-TR: Delayed, infrequent, or absent orgasm or markedly decreased intensity of orgasm after a normal sexual arousal phase on all or almost all occasions of sexual activity Distress or interpersonal problems due to orgasmic dysfunction No other disorder or substance that exclusively accounts for the orgasmic dysfunction Symptoms must have been present for 6 months. Because the type of stimulation that triggers orgasm varies widely, clinicians must use clinical judgment to determine whether the woman's response is deficient, based on her age, sexual experience, and adequacy of the sexual stimulation she receives.

Washington, DC, American Psychiatric Association, 2022. Treatment of Female Orgasmic Disorder Self-stimulation Sex therapy Psychological therapies Data support encouraging self-stimulation (masturbation). First-line treatment of female orgasmic disorders is directed masturbation, which involves a series of prescribed exercises. A vibrator placed on the mons pubis close to the clitoris may help, as may increasing the number and intensity of stimuli), simultaneously if necessary. Education about sexual function (eg, need to stimulate other areas of the body before the clitoris) may help. Sex therapy for women, with or without their partners, can often help them with concerns about sexual performance and feelings. Other psychological therapies, including cognitive-behavioral therapy and psychotherapy, may help women identify and manage fear of vulnerability and issues of trust with a partner.

Currently, no data suggest that any medication is efficacious in the treatment of female orgasmic disorder. Key Points Diagnose orgasmic disorder based on DSM-5-TR clinical criteria. Treat with directed masturbation, usually as first-line therapy. Recommend sex therapy and other psychological therapies to help women identify and manage factors that contribute to orgasmic "}
