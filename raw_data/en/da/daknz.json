One can survive without a kidney, half a lung, or even half a body part, but a healthy liver must live a smooth, functioning body. As the culture of healthy living is upon us and growing constantly, people are getting more and more conscious about the health of their liver and detoxification. This attention to Ayurveda for liver detox and Ayurveda for liver disorders is well deserved as the liver itself carries out some of the body's prime functions. From steadily filtering and detoxifying the blood and suspending tired blood cells, which otherwise might lead to harmful impurities entering the stream, playing a significant part in digestion to producing essential enzymes and hormones, the liver solely carries out almost 500 functions of the body. Let us see some of the prime functions of the liver in detail- - Detoxification of blood: So far, we know that the liver is entrusted with filtering the blood and eliminating toxins from the bloodstream. When we eat, the [digestive tract](http://drniveditapandey.com/blog/the-workings-of-the-digestive-system-explained/)breaks the food down part by part, and the energy derived from it is then allowed to enter the bloodstream. This pure juice of energy then travels to the liver to be further refined and filtered, and eliminated from unwanted toxins to further circulate into the body's broader part. - Bile Juice Formation: Bile is an alkaline fluid that helps to emulsify fats and facilitates a smooth digestion process; after producing the bile juice, the liver temporarily stores it into the gallbladder. It is further carried into the small intestine to digest food. - Generates Metabolism: The liver plays a critical role in generating metabolism from ingested nutrients. It can break down complex substances into different categories of essential vitamins glucose, cholesterol, phospholipids, and lipoproteins. - Producing blood-clotting factors: The liver also produces blood-clotting agents, and at the same time, it helps in creating protective elements that keep the blood clots from blocking the circulatory system.
