A science of eternal healing, it iscompared to a vast ocean, and studying Ayurveda to swimming across. A trueteacher can teach one how to swim, but the swimming is up to the student; ...itis a lifelong journey.\"-Charaka Samhita, Sutrasthana, Chapter Thirty Brief description of the Institute and ProgramAccording to materials prepared by the Ayurvedic Institute (1999), it is\"recognized as one of the leading Ayurveda schools and Ayurvedic health spas outsideof India.\" It was established in 1984 to \"teach and provide the traditional therapy ofEast Indian Ayurveda including herbs, nutrition, panchakarma cleansing, andacupressure massage. The Institute also offers programs in the related disciplines ofAyurveda: Sanskrit, Yoga and Jyotish (Vedic astrology).The Ayurvedic Studies Program is the foundation of the educational programsoffered at the Institute. The program consists of three academic terms: Introduction toPhilosophy and Theory of Ayurveda which takes place every fall quarter; Introduction toClinical Assessment (winter quarter); and Introduction to Management of Disorders(spring quarter). Upon completion of the program, a certificate of completion isawarded. This completes the first academic year and is approximately 700 classroomhours. It is important to note here that the classroom hours are approximately 700hours of classroom study. No absolutes are given, but only approximations as thenumber of hours of classroom study are not as important within the Vedic model of 0 Copyright, 1999. Curtis R. Rogers3 Ayurvedic Studies3 education as is what is learned and taught by both teacher and student. The Vedicmodel will be discussed later.Rationale for choosing the programAs a child, I grew up with parents who always encouraged experimentation andbelieved that learning took place through experience. My mother was a very closefriend of a Hindu woman and through her family, I was able to experience many facetsof the Hindu culture such as food preparation, interpersonal communication, andtraditional Hindu dress. In addition, through art, I was exposed to many various formsof artistic expression, especially that of Asian and Native American art. I rememberworkshops at children's museums where Native American forms of art were taught,thus exposing me to gain an appreciation for other cultures.Upon entering college, this childhood exposure lead me wanting to experiencemore about Hinduism; however, I only felt comfortable experiencing it throughreadings. Readings of spiritual texts such as the Upanishads, the Bhagavad-Gita, andthe Contemporary Hindu Catechism, led to my desire to gain a better understandingand appreciation of the ancient Indian healing tradition of medicine called Ayurveda.Major questionsThe major questions asked while reviewing the Institute's Ayurvedic Studiesprogram were: What is Ayurveda? What is the model of education? How does thiseastern form of Vedic education in Ayurvedic Studies accomplish its goals? and What isthe interaction between teacher and student in the Vedic model of education withrespect to Ayurvedic Institute authors a web site at http://www.ayurveda.com thatcontains a wealth of information about their programs and products. Included isinformation about:Ayurveda,accreditation and recognition of the Institute,a listing of core faculty, admission, registration and academic regulationinformation,and departmental information which contains the Educational, Herb, PanchaKarma, Publishing, Yoga, and Sanskrit departments.Additionally, I sought licensure information from the New Mexico State Commissionon Higher Education. According to Carrie Cole at the Commission (1999), the AyurvedicInstitute began offering classes in 1984 and has been licensed as a private institution ofhigher education in the state of New Mexico. Since 1994, the Institute has continuouslyreceived annual licensure renewal from the commission. The Institute's licensure isregulated by the New Mexico state regulation (now known as the Administrative Code)5 NMAC 100.2 et. seq. which states:The Post-Secondary Educational Institution ...authorizes the New MexicoCommission on Higher Education (\"Commission\") to establish and monitorguidelines for the licensure of all private postsecondary institutionsoperating in New Mexico.The purpose of 5 NMAC 100.2 is to guide implementation of the Post-Secondary Educational Institution Act by defining clear expectations ofinstitutions operating in the state while recognizing the varied purposesand clienteles of those institutions. It is the intent of the New MexicoCommission on Higher Education to encourage sound institutional 0 Copyright, 1999. Curtis R. Rogers5 Ayurvedic Studies5 practices that result in high quality educational programs and expand thearray of educational options available to New Mexico's citizens. (1999)Ms. Cole also mentioned that the Institute both locally and through its distanceeducation program annually enrolls 300-500 students.Barbara Cook (1999), the Institute's registrar responded to the followingquestions via email correspondence regarding the Ayurvedic Studies program:1. Who is the focus of the goal statements, the student or the teacher? 2.How much commitment to students is evidenced by the program's goalstatement? For example, \"Students will learn ...\" or \"Students will have theopportunity to learn ...\" 3.Generally, goals can be divided into three primary domains: cognitive,affective, and psychomotor. Sometimes a social-interpersonal domain isadded. Where do the program goals fall? 4.Do the goal statements have a past, present, or future orientation?Ms. Cook also provided answers and suggestions to various other questions relating tostudent experiences via email correspondence.The Institute's Academic Catalog was reviewed. Web sites such as that of theInstitute and online Hindu texts such as the Bhagavad-Gita were reviewed to gaininsight to the culture and nature of Ayurveda.What is Ayurveda?Ayurveda is derived from the Sanskrit word roots \"ayus\" and \"vid\" meaning lifeand knowledge respectfully. Ayus represents a combination of the body, sense organs,mind and soul, therefore Ayurveda means \"knowledge concerning the maintenance of \u00a9 Copyright, 1999. Curtis R. Rogers6 Ayurvedic Studies6 life\" (Warrier & Gunawant, 1997). The basic tenets of this form of holistic medicineaims to hinder illness and to equalize mind, body and spirit. Actually, the relationship towestern medicine would be that of the allopathic forms of health maintenance andpreventive medicine but in a more holistic, naturapathic form.What is the Vedic model of education?The Vedic educational model is quite different from the \"western\" experiencewith which most of us are familiar. Simply put, \"the knowledge is taught with the body,mind and spiritual components intact, along with practical examples, ceremonies andstories.\" (Cook, 1999)Ayurveda and its relation to Indian philosophy is derived from the Vedas, thedivine Hindu books of knowledge (Warder & Gunawant, 1997). It is important tounderstand that in the religious context of Hinduism a combination of religious texts orscriptures are used in worship. Hindu sacred texts are broken into two areas: Vedasand Upanishads. As pointed out earlier, the term \"Veda\" means knowledge while theword \"Upanishad\" means \"sitting down near to\". There are four Vedas: Rig, Sama,Yajur, and Atharva. Many Upanishads exist with the most popular being theMahabarata, the Bhagavad-Gita, and the Ramayana but many Hindu scholars agreethat there are about thirteen Upanishads that are the most important. (Fowler, 1997)Ayurveda's relationship to scriptural texts is with the fourth Vedic known asthe Atharva Veda. This Veda using mantras, herbs, and potions\" (Warrier & Gunawant, 1997). The system \u00a9 Copyright, 1999. Curtis R. Rogers7 Ayurvedic Studies7 Ayurvedic medicine is described in detail in the most popular of all Ayurvedic texts, theCharaka Samhita.In the Vedic education model, which would pertain to the Vedas and not theUpanishads, the self is focal point of all knowledge and being.\"Vedic Education is the means to enliven the total knowledge of Natural Law inthe consciousness, Atma, the Self of everyone raising the quality of individualintelligence to Cosmic Intelligence, so that everyone always spontaneously livesdaily life in accord with the total creative intelligence of Natural Law life alwaysspontaneously upheld in the direction of evolution.\" (Maharishi Vedic University,1996.) Education begins with a concentration on an understanding of the self forwithout that understanding no learning can take place. Although the upanishadic textsmake similar correlations to the self and education and self-learning, the overallcondition of self-awareness and definition must be first accepted by the self beforelearning and understanding can take place. From this self-understanding, trust isexposed which allows the teacher and his or her knowledge to be taken seriously andwith complete trust from the student.The goal of Vedic education is to use the self and a complete understanding ofthe self to transfer knowledge from teacher to student. From the scriptural textperspective, \"to realize that the true self is not really engaged in action, to begin with,and that science and technology (and the worlds formed by them) exist merely at thephenomenal level, and therefore have no transcendental effect on becoming or ultimatefate of the self. To achieve this realization is a goal that must pervade every level andsphere of education.\" (Glitz, 1995) 0 Copyright, 1999. Curtis R. Rogers8 Ayurvedic Studies8 The Vedic education model as it pertains to Ayurveda would clearly support thisstatement in that the science of life cannot exist without the self or an understanding ofthe self relating to all learning and knowledge models. If one rejects the self, then onerejects Ayurveda. Similarly, if the self is not understood, Ayurveda cannot be taught or learned.Goals and ObjectivesDue to the cosmic nature of the Vedic educational model, goals and objectivesmay not necessarily be written, but only brought forth during the developingrelationship between the student and teacher interaction. Therefore, only vaguestatements about the goals of the program are expressed in writing. The purpose ofwriting goals for a program in Ayurvedic Studies would be to westernize the educationalprocess of an Eastern-based Vedic education model. Goals of the Institute as a wholeare expressed by the Institute's director, Dr. Vasant Lad:It is the dream of Dr. Vasant Lad ...and the goal of the Ayurvedic Institute tooffer a complete program of Ayurvedic study including a Master's Degreesupported by our experienced and distinguished faculty combined with theopportunity for advanced clinical work in India. This full-fledged program wouldbe a way that one can study Ayurvedically, this is to make Ayurveda a way oflife. (Cook, 1999) Therefore, the goal of the Ayurvedic Studies program is to make Ayurveda a way of life.How does this eastern form of Vedic education in Ayurvedic Studiesaccomplish its goals?The Ayurvedic programs reflect the style of sitting with a traditional Indianteacher which I term a combined \"Upanishadic\" and Vedic model of education. In the 0 Copyright, 1999. Curtis R. Rogers9 Ayurvedic Studies9 traditional Vedic model, the \"goal statement\" is determined by the teacher and may ormay not be communicated to the student. The student's goal is just to find the rightteacher. So, after carefully examining and choosing a teacher, the student is expectedto then fully trust the teacher as to what is taught, how it is taught, and what the finaloutcome will be. It is taken for granted after the initial search and testing process,(which is pursued by both parties) that the teacher knows what to do and how to do itand has the student's best interests in mind.Completely trusting the teacher to know what is best for the student is not idealfor most westerners. The western educational model lies mostly within a cognitivetaxonomy with remembering, understanding, application, analysis, evaluation andcreation of knowledge being the basis for teaching and learning. The Vedic modelrelies heavily on a social-interpersonal taxonomy where self-awareness, socialization,and the altruistic components of knowledge are emphasized. Since most Americanshave been taught using the western approach to education it is difficult for them totranscend to the Vedic model. So, in the first year Ayurvedic Studies program theInstitute sticks to the spirit of the Vedic model, in that Dr. Lad is the most influential\"vote\" in determining what is taught. This approach helps to ease students not used tothe eastern style of education into the Vedic model. A set curriculum does exist thathas largely been developed by many students' needs and desires over the years and istherefore constantly changing.Dr. Lad determines the overall general goals and to some extent, the students dohave a say in what is taught. The Gurukula (advanced Ayurveda studies program) is \u00a9 Copyright, 1999. Curtis R. Rogers10 Ayurvedic Studies10 more traditional.Students are expected to let Dr. Lad teach what he wants and howhe wants within the parameters of \"Ayurvedic science,\" which is vast enough toincorporate many different teachings and styles. No curriculum is planned for thisprogram.Dr. Lad can teach anything he wants (in the realm of Ayurveda) from day today based on what he feels would benefit the students at that particular moment.Students are encouraged to enter this program with the purpose of spending more timewith the teacher in a smaller more intimate setting, rather than gaining any particularpieces of knowledge even though the knowledge presented is quite advanced. Dr. Laddetermines the goals in that program to a much greater extent. Though student input isnot discouraged in this program, an obligation on the part of the Institute and itsinstructors to accept it is not as high as it is in the first year program.The commitment made to a student in the Vedic model as it is still practiced incertain rare teacher-student relationships is such that the teacher would do anything toinsure that the knowledge is passed on to the student. There are no limits to thecommitments made between a sincere dedicated student and his or her destinedteacher. Old Vedic texts say that the teacher will incarnate again and again in order tobring the student to the goal, and that a student will find his teacher again and again,lifetime after lifetime until the goal is met. The teacher is totally and completelycommitted to the student's education and overall well being. This is somewhat like theold western monk/elder relationship. Very simply put, the commitment to the studentsis that \"we will do our best to create an environment where they can not only learn asmuch Ayurveda as they want to and are able to, but also where they'll be supported in \u00a9 Copyright, 1999. Curtis R. Rogers11 Ayurvedic Studies11 their growth and development as humans and in their own healing as far as they wish\" (Cook, 1999).Dr. Lad's goal is simply to teach Ayurveda in the purest way he can whileintegrating it into Western medical models and healing traditions. Because of who heis, and the nature of Ayurveda itself a system of healing that involves a great deal ofself-inquiry), students are generally affected on all the levels: cognitive, affective, andpsychomotor, once they embark on studies. The goal of the Ayurvedic studies programis the same as that of the Ayurvedic clinical model: integration of all aspects of thepersonality with the goal of obtaining good physical health, happiness, and self-awareness (Cook, 1999).According to Barbara Cook, the Institute's registrar, \"Our goal is to makeAyurveda available as a healing system to the West. This sounds like a future goal, butit is also a daily goal. What we set out to do in the present day today doesn't seem tobe separate from what unfolds in the future\"InterpretationAnalysis and synthesis of the program of study has lead to a model thatdescribes the process students follow to reach the goal of making Ayurveda a way oflife. This means that the student must become totally immersed in the subject andrelated subject areas of Ayurveda and must live their lives in a manner consistent withthe tenets of Ayurvedic medicine. \u00a9 Copyright, 1999. Curtis R. Rogers12 Making Ayurveda a Way of Life ........................Western:PredominatelyCognitiveAyurvedic Ayurveda ScienceyrNReligion CulturezAyurvedic Studies12 Vedic EducationModel Eastern:PredominatelyMixedCognitive/Social-InterpersonalTaxonomy Figure 1. This figure represents the external and internal forces for attaining the goal of the AyurvedicStudies Program and the main components of the student's goal-seeking process. The Ayurvedic Institute is aware that most Western students have been taughtpredominantly via the cognitive educational model. In an attempt to ease the studentinto becoming a better student of Ayurveda, the program recognizes this and looselyincorporates it into this first-year program.However, the ultimate goal of the program is to make Ayurveda a way of life forits students, and in doing this, the processes of the Vedic educational model must beheavily relied upon. This would clearly make the goal of the program atransformational one. 130 Copyright, 1999. Curtis R. Rogers Ayurvedic Studies13 At the center of the program is self-awareness. Culture, religion, and science areall predominant components of Ayurveda and when combined in a program of studycan create a sense of self-awareness for the student. The Ayurvedic studies program istaught in the traditional Vedic educational model that is heavily based in the social-interpersonal educational taxonomy. Within this taxonomy, increasing self-awareness,socialization utilizing universal truths within the context of holistic and naturapathicmedicine, and other altruistic examples such as stories from sacred Hindu texts presentthe ideology in which Ayurveda is based.Students who enroll in this program may be searching for personal self-awareness and an understanding of humanity and its relation to the self through holisticmedicine. After reaching a higher level of self-awareness, only then can the studentsuccessfully advise patients Ayurvedically in both an educational and social context.The clinical context of treatment consists of diagnosis of illness, administration of herbaltherapy, and creation of wellness programs for patients that combine proper diet andexercise. Socially, Ayurveda goes many steps beyond traditional forms of Westernallopathic medicine by incorporating cultural and religious-based belief systems with thepatient's physical and spiritual wellness in mind.Because this model attempts to explain the elements involved in Ayurveda itself,a delineation has been made between religion and science for the Western student.The Vedic educational model relies heavily upon the close combination of religion andscience and its components are an integral part of Ayurveda. However, the culturalinfluence on Ayurveda must be identified because culture is the underlying influence of \u00a9 Copyright, 1999. Curtis R. Rogers14 Ayurvedic Studies14 religion and science and directly influences Ayurveda. Therefore, religion and sciencedirectly influence Ayurveda. All three, however, are directly influenced by culture.The dashed line in figure one represents a loose interaction whereas thecontinuous lines represent a strong connection between subjects. For instance, cultureis related to the scientific and religious components that lead to Ayurveda, yet theyindividually are direct forces on Ayurveda. The three forces work together to supportAyurveda and its relationship to understanding the self.The Ayurvedic studies program draws loosely from the Western cognitiveeducational taxonomy but most heavily from the Vedic model and Ayurveda itself.These forces combine to promote and even help create self-awareness and theknowledge base needed to make Ayurveda a way of life and are indicated in figure oneby directional continuous lines.Experiences and GoalsDuring another correspondence with Barbara Cook (1999), the programregistrar, I asked how experiences are provided to the students in the program. Shementioned that due to the limitations on Ayurveda in the US (namely that it is simplynot recognized at all and therefore no scope of practice exists even for physicianstrained in India) consultations are educational only and not medical. Students areallowed to observe these interactions but not allowed to do clinical examination.In India, Ayurveda is passed on from generation to generation from parent tochild or from teacher to student. In this model, the student is expected to spend asmuch time as the teacher lets him or her spend observing, assisting, and listening while 0 Copyright, 1999. Curtis R. Rogers15 Ayurvedic Studies.15 the teacher goes about the daily business of seeing patients, creating herbal formulas,etc. The student experiences what the teacher experiences on a day to day basis, andthis is the education. It is a lengthy method of learning and can start when the studentis still a child.This is considered the most effective way for an aspiring physician tolearn. Due to cultural, religious and medical tradition in the west, this form ofapprenticeship is often impossible. Since the Institute can not present this model oflearning to its students, and since Ayurveda is not recognized as legal medicine in theUnited States, medical Ayurveda is not emphasized. The students' experiences aresomewhat limited to theoretical discussions and their own creative experimentation withAyurevdic concepts in their daily lives. This experimentation is well supported by thevery strong foundation in theory that is provided them (Cook, 1999).Students are required to take Yoga classes twice a week and this often proves tobe an amazing way of learning about the body experientially. From the first day ofclass, students are also required to start learning Sanskrit. One of the ways thatAyurvedic knowledge (and any Vedic knowledge) has always been given is through thelistening to and chanting of Sanskrit verses called sutras. This form of rotememorization factors into the cognitive taxonomy of learning. Sutras are little lines orverses of poetry which incorporate meter and melody and are easily memorized. Theypresent big nebulous concepts in a brief poetic verse which is constructed in such a waythat it inspires profound understanding of something that cannot easily be explained incommon prose. The students' learning and chanting of these verses gives them much 0 Copyright, 1999. Curtis R. Rogers16 Ayurvedic Studies16 experiential knowledge on many levels, including the experience of how Ayurveda hasbeen taught throughout the ages (Cook, 1999).Students are also provided access to people in fields related to Ayurveda. Theyare invited to take an herb walk each year with a herbalist who has had many years's ofexperience in Ayurevdic and Western herbs. Bodyworkers and polarity therapists whohave studied Ayurveda and use it in their philosophies of practice provide seminars forstudents in the program.Students also have access to a library of rare (and not sorare) texts on Ayurveda and many other disciplines. These experiences in conjunctionwith classroom study and interaction with other students aids each one in reaching thegoal of making Ayurveda a way of life (Cook, 1999).Program EffectivenessSince Ayurveda is not a regulated form of clinical medicine in the United States,little to no criteria and standards are used to determine program effectiveness. This isdirectly related to assessment and evaluation in that no accrediting body requiresAyurvedic programs to follow certain rules that would make it a viable program ofstudy. Therefore, the Institute relies on a blend of statistical and informal internalassessment. Faculty and staff judge the program's effectiveness by how well thestudents do on their final oral exams, how interested they are in continuing theireducation in the advanced programs or weekend seminars, and whether many of thembecome interested in working for the Institute.The various types of data used to determine program's effectiveness \"comesfrom the numbers (students' grades, the drop-out rate, number of students receiving a \u00a9 Copyright, 1999. Curtis R. Rogers17 Ayurvedic Studies17 certificate of completion, the number of students wanting to continue, etc.) and muchof what we know comes from the combined effect that all our interactions with thestudents has had on us throughout the year\" (Cook, 1999). These combinedassessments form a blend of approximately 50% quantitative and 50% qualitativeprogram analysis.Results and ConclusionAttempts to contact other faculty or students in the program were unsuccessfultherefore, triangulation of the information presented by the registrar was not possible.However, I did not find any contradictions in information presented in the programcatalog with that of Ms. Cook's. Correspondence with Ms. Cook allowed me to draw theconclusion that the Institute is successful in reaching its goal with students who wantto reach the goal of making Ayurveda a way of life. Students who demonstrate notonly to the Institute but also to themselves making Ayurveda a way of life fulfill both apersonal and institutional goal. However, students who do not fulfill this goal may infact achieve many other personal goals such as self-awareness, esoteric cultural andreligious Hindu knowledge, and simply a different method of learning via the Vediceducational model.The combination of taking the student's previous methods of learning andcombining them with the Vedic educational model is a great strength of this program.Praxis is the practice of an art or science as discerned from theoretical knowledge. TheAyurvedic Institute's program in Ayurvedic Studies takes this approach to place theoryinto practice. By doing this, the program should have great success by attempting to 18\u00a9 Copyright, 1999. Curtis R. Rogers Ayurvedic Studies18 create lifelong learners in a field of study where making a lifestyle change is the main goal. 190 Copyright, 1999. Curtis R.
