To provide for the medical needs of the uninsured while connecting them to existing community resources. To share Christ's love and hope with patients and volunteers alike. Heal the City is a 501(c) 3 founded by Dr. Alan Keister, an Amarillo physician who identified a desperate need for healthcare throughout certain neighborhoods within Amarillo. Dr. Keister began by offering free health screenings at various schools such as San Jacinto Elementary where organizers saw more than 500 people in two hours time. This overwhelming neighborhood response not only highlighted a critical need but sparked the vision to open a free medical clinic in the San Jacinto neighborhood...

There was not much I could do about it though because I simply could not afford the medications I needed. I would never go to the doctor, even if I was very sick. Lindy has single handedly helped me overcome my fear of coming to the doctor. Beyond my physical health, HTC has also helped me mentally and spiritually be there for my adopted son. Due to my son's birth mother using drugs during her pregnancy, he was born with multiple emotional disabilities. I needed him just as much as he needed me but being a mother to him is very hard at times due to his lack of emotion and unpredictable nature. HTC has taught me how to love him through this and constantly motivates me to continue being there for him. People always ask me if I am afraid of him hurting me, but I just respond that God's got me regardless. I will continue loving him either way.
