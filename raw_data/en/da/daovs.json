The flu is much more than the common cold. Some people affected by the flu may have mild symptoms, however others can be restricted to bed for a week or more and unable to work or care for their family. For some people, flu can cause severe illness, hospitalisation and life-threatening complications. Those more at risk of serious symptoms are babies, people aged over 65 years, people with underlying illnesses and pregnant women. Can I get a flu vaccine at the same time as a COVID-19 vaccine? The Covid vaccine and Influenza vaccine can be co-administered i.e., given at the same time.

Will the flu shot protect me against COVID-19? Unfortunately having a flu shot won't protect you against Covid. Each virus triggers a different immune response from our body to fight it. You will need both the covid and influenza vaccines to be protected. Will I get the flu from the flu shot? No, you cannot catch the flu from the flu shot. The influenza vaccine is composed of Inactivated Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine. Are there side effects of the flu vaccine? Side effects of the flu vaccine are generally mild. They may start a few hours after vaccination and generally last less than 1-2 days. Side effects may include: - localised pain, redness and swelling at the injection site - a small, hard lump (nodule) at the injection-site (can last 1-2 weeks) - drowsiness or tiredness - muscle aches - A low-grade temperature (fever), which may be managed with paracetamol. Very rarely, more serious side effects can occur following administration of the flu vaccine. They can include hives, angioedema and anaphylaxis. If you are concerned that your side effects are severe or persistent, please contact your GP, visit your nearest hospital emergency department or call '000' immediately. How can I prevent getting and spreading the flu? - Having an annual vaccination each year between March and June prior to the peak of the flu season is your best protection. - Observing good hand hygiene, including regular and thorough hand washing with soap or hand sanitiser reduces the spread of the virus. - Coughing etiquette, including the use of a tissue to cover your nose and mouth when coughing and sneezing, and disposing of the tissue immediately. - Stay at home while you are unwell. In particular, avoid going to work or school or visiting busy public places. FAQ - COVID-19 Do I have to wait between getting the Influenza (flu) and COVID-19 vaccine? [COVID-19 vaccines can be co-administered](https://www.health.gov.au/initiatives-and-programs/covid-19-vaccines/advice-for-providers/clinical-guidance/clinical-recommendations#timing-of-administration-of-other-vaccines%E2%80%93) (that is, given on the same day) with an influenza vaccine. Studies show that co-administration of COVID-19 and influenza vaccines is safe and produces a good immune response. Do people who have had COVID-19 and recovered need to get vaccinated? People who have had COVID-19 and recovered should still be vaccinated. The protection someone gains from having COVID-19 varies from person to person. Because this virus is new, experts don't yet know how long any natural immunity might last. This is why vaccination is so important to protect people from severe disease. Even if you have already had COVID-19, you should still get the [COVID-19 vaccine](https://www.health.gov.au/initiatives-and-programs/covid-19-vaccines) when you can. Why should I get a COVID-19 vaccine? COVID-19 is a disease caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2. It can cause severe lung and generalised disease. As of 7 March 2022, it has caused over 5.9 million deaths worldwide, with more than 445 million cases reported. By vaccinating, you are protecting yourself and others from severe COVID-19. It is also likely that once a large proportion of the population is vaccinated, this will decrease the spread of COVID-19 in our community. Does the COVID-19 vaccine protect me against Influenza (flu)? The [COVID-19 vaccine](https://www.health.gov.au/initiatives-and-programs/covid-19-vaccines/approved-vaccines) does not protect against the [flu](https://www.health.gov.au/health-topics/flu-influenza), so you should still have your annual flu shot. Who is recommended to receive a booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine? People aged 16 years and older, who received their second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine 3 or more months ago, are recommended to get a single booster dose. Why should I get a booster vaccine if I have already had 2 doses? There is evidence to show that protection from COVID-19 vaccines against infection reduces overtime. To address this decline, a booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine has been recommended. Having a booster dose will protect you from COVID-19 for longer. If you do not get a booster dose your immunity against the virus may reduce overtime. This means you may be more likely to get infected with the virus and pass it on to others. What vaccine will I be receiving and how does it work? Health Watch Australia will be offering the Pfizer (Comirnaty) vaccine. Comirnaty, also called BNT162b2, is a COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech. It is an mRNA vaccine that contains the genetic code for an important part of the COVID-19 virus called the 'spike protein'. After getting the injection, your body reads the genetic code and makes copies of the spike protein. Your immune system then detects these spike proteins and learns how to recognise and fight against COVID-19. The genetic code is quickly broken down and cleared away by the body. "}
