These adverse reactions have included altered mental states including severe somnolence, central nervous system effects including convulsions, and peripheral neuropathy ranging from numbness and paresthesias to motor weakness and paralysis. There have also been reports of adverse reactions associated with demyelination, and ascending peripheral neuropathies similar in appearance to Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome [see WARNINGS AND [PRECAUTIONS](/arranon-drug.htm#P)]. Full recovery from these adverse reactions has not always occurred with cessation of therapy with ARRANON. Close monitoring for neurologic adverse reactions is strongly recommended, and ARRANON should be discontinued for neurologic adverse reactions of NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 2 or greater [see WARNINGS AND [PRECAUTIONS](/arranon-drug.htm#P)]. DESCRIPTION ARRANON (nelarabine) the The chemical name for nelarabine is 2-amino-9--D-arabinofuranosyl-6-methoxy-9H- [purine](https://www.rxlist.com/purine/definition.htm). It has the molecular formula C11H15N5O5 and a molecular weight of 297.27. Nelarabine has the following structural formula: Nelarabine is slightly soluble to soluble in water and melts with decomposition between 209\u00b0C and 217\u00b0C. ARRANON Injection is supplied as a clear, colorless, sterile solution in glass single-dose vials. Each vial contains 250 mg of nelarabine (5 mg nelarabine per mL) and the inactive ingredient sodium chloride (4.5 mg per mL) in 50 mL Water for Injection, USP. ARRANON is intended for intravenous infusion. Hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide may have been used to adjust the pH. The solution pH ranges from 5.0 to 7.0. INDICATIONS ARRANON is indicated for the treatment of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) in adult and pediatric patients age 1 year and older whose disease has not responded to or has relapsed following treatment with at least 2 chemotherapy regimens. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended Dosage This product is for intravenous use only. Adult Dosage The recommended adult dose of ARRANON is 1500 mg/m\u00b2 administered intravenously over 2 hours on Days 1, 3, and 5 repeated every 21 days. Administer ARRANON undiluted. Pediatric Dosage The recommended pediatric dose of ARRANON is 650 mg/m\u00b2 administered intravenously over 1 hour daily for 5 consecutive days repeated every 21 days. Administer ARRANON undiluted. The recommended duration of treatment for adult and pediatric patients has not been clearly established. In clinical trials, treatment was generally continued until there was evidence of disease progression, the patient experienced unacceptable toxicity, the patient became a candidate for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), or the patient no longer continued to benefit from treatment. Dosage Modification Discontinue ARRANON if the patient develops a neurologic adverse reaction of NCI CTCAE Grade 2 or greater. Dosage may be delayed for other toxicity, including hematologic toxicity [see [BOXED WARNING](/arranon-drug.htm#BW), WARNINGS AND [PRECAUTION](/arranon-drug.htm#P)]. Dosage In Special Populations ARRANON has not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction [see [Use In Specific Populations](/arranon-drug.htm#USP)]. No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with a creatinine clearance (CLCr) greater than or equal to 50 mL/min [see [CLINICAL PHARMACOLOG](/arranon-drug.htm#CP)]. There are insufficient data to support a dose recommendation for patients with a CLCr less than 50 mL/min. Prevention Of Hyperuricemia Take precautions against hyperuricemia (e.g., hydration, alkalinization, and prophylaxis with allopurinol) [see WARNINGS AND [PRECAUTIONS](/arranon-drug.htm#P)].

Revised: Jun 2019 SIDE EFFECTS The following clinically-significant adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: - Neurologic [see [BOXED - Tumor Lysis Syndrome [see WARNINGS AND [PRECAUTIONS](/arranon-drug.htm#P)] - Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines [see WARNINGS AND [PRECAUTIONS](/arranon-drug.htm#P)] Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Relapsed Or Refractory T-ALL And T-LBL ARRANON was studied in 459 patients in Phase I and Phase II clinical trials. Adult Patient The safety profile of ARRANON is based on data from 103 adult patients treated with the recommended dose and schedule in 2 studies: an adult T-ALL/T-cell T-LBL trial and an adult chronic lymphocytic leukemia trial. The most common adverse reactions in adults were fatigue; gastrointestinal disorders (nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and constipation); hematologic disorders (anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia); respiratory disorders (cough and dyspnea); nervous system disorders (somnolence and dizziness); and pyrexia. The most common adverse reactions in adults by Body System, including severe or life-threatening adverse reactions (NCI CTCAE Grade 3 or Grade 4) and fatal adverse reactions (Grade 5) are shown in Table 1. Table 1: Most Commonly Reported ( 5% Overall) Adverse Reactions in Adult Patients Treated With 1500 mg/m\u00b2 of ARRANON Administered Intravenously Over 2 Hours on Days 1, 3, and 5 Repeated Every 21 Days |Body System | Adverse Reaction |Percentage of Patients | (N= |Toxicity a Five (5) patients had a fatal adverse reaction. Fatal adverse reactions included hypotension (n = 1), respiratory arrest (n = 1), pleural effusion/pneumothorax (n = 1), pneumonia (n = 1), and cerebral hemorrhage/coma/leukoencephalopathy (n = 1). Other Adverse Reactions Blurred vision was also reported in 4% of adult patients. There was a single report of biopsy-confirmed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in the adult patient population. Neurologic Adverse Reactions Nervous system adverse reactions, were reported for 76% of adult patients across the Phase I and Phase II trials. The most common neurologic adverse reactions ( 2%) in adult patients including all grades (NCI CTCAE) are shown in Table 2. Table 2: Neurologic Adverse Reactions ( 2%) in Adult Patients Treated With 1500 mg/m\u00b2 of ARRANON Administered Intravenously Over 2 Hours on Days 1, 3, and 5 Repeated Every 21 Days |Nervous System Disorders | Adverse Reaction |Percentage of Patients | (N =103) |Grade 1 fatal neurologic adverse reaction, cerebral hemorrhage/coma/leukoencephalopathy. Most nervous system adverse reactions in the adult patients were evaluated as Grade 1 or 2. The additional Grade 3 adverse reactions in adult patients, were aphasia, convulsion, hemiparesis, and loss of consciousness, each reported in 1 patient (1%). The additional Grade 4 adverse reactions were cerebral hemorrhage, coma, intracranial hemorrhage, leukoencephalopathy, and metabolic encephalopathy, each reported in one patient (1%). The other neurologic adverse reactions reported as Grade 1, 2, or unknown in adult patients were abnormal coordination, burning sensation, disturbance in attention, dysarthria, hyporeflexia, neuropathic pain, nystagmus, peroneal nerve palsy, sciatica, sensory disturbance, sinus headache, and speech disorder, each reported in one patient (1%). Pediatric Patient The safety profile for children is based on data from 84 pediatric patients treated with the recommended dose and schedule in a T-ALL/T-LBL treatment trial. The most common adverse reactions in pediatric patients were hematologic disorders (anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia). Of the non-hematologic adverse reactions in pediatric patients, the most frequent adverse reactions reported were headache, increased transaminase levels, decreased blood potassium,decreased blood albumin, increased blood bilirubin, and vomiting.

The other neurologic adverse reactions reported as Grade 1, 2, or unknown in pediatric patients were dysarthria, encephalopathy, hydrocephalus, hyporeflexia, lethargy, mental impairment, paralysis, and sensory loss, each reported in 1 patient (1%). ARRANON In Combination With Multi-Agent Chemotherapy In T-ALL And T-LBL ARRANON was studied in combination with multi-agent chemotherapy in a randomized clinical trial [NCT00408005]. The safety population in this trial included 804 patients with newly-diagnosed T-ALL (85%) or T-LBL (15%) treated with (n = 411) or without (n =393) ARRANON in combination with the augmented Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster chemotherapy regimen (aBFM) after initial induction therapy. Patients assigned to ARRANON received 650 mg/m\u00b2 intravenously over 1 hour daily for 5 consecutive days, during consolidation Days 1 to 5 and 43 to 47, delayed intensification Days 29 to 33, and during the initial 3 courses of maintenance Days 29 to 33. The median age on enrollment was 9.5 years (range: 1-29), the majority of patients were male (73%) and white (69%). Sixty-five percent of patients assigned to the ARRANON arms received at least 85% of the planned dose through the third course of maintenance therapy compared to 79% of patients on the control arms who received 3 courses of maintenance therapy. There was one fatal neurological adverse reaction in the ARRANON arm. The incidence of the following Grades 3 and 4 adverse reactions were higher in the ARRANON treated arms compared to the control arms: abnormal transaminases, motor and sensory neuropathy, nausea and vomiting, and dehydration. The incidence of seizures of any grade was 3% (14 of 411). Rhabdomyolysis was diagnosed in 2% (7 of 411) of ARRANON treated patients and occurred after the first course of ARRANON during the consolidation phase of therapy. Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ARRANON. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Infections and Infestations: Fatal opportunistic infections Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: Tumor [lysis](https://www.rxlist.com/lysis/definition.htm) syndrome Nervous System Disorders: [Demyelination](https://www.rxlist.com/demyelination/definition.htm) and ascending peripheral neuropathies similar in appearance Musculoskeletal and Connective Disorders: [Rhabdomyolysis](https://www.rxlist.com/rhabdomyolysis/definition.htm), blood [creatine](https://www.rxlist.com/creatine/supplements.htm) phosphokinase in combination with [adenosine](https://www.rxlist.com/adenosine/definition.htm) deaminase ( [ADA](https://www.rxlist.com/ada_american_diabetes_association/definition.htm)) pentostatin, is not recommended [see [CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY](/arranon-drug.htm#CP)]. WARNINGS Included as part of the PRECAUTIONS section. PRECAUTIONS Neurologic Adverse Reactions Nervous system adverse reactions of any grade were reported for 223 (76%) adult patients across the Phase I and Phase II trials, and Grade 3 or higher (severe, life-threatening, or fatal) adverse reactions were reported for 55 (19%) patients following initiation of ARRANON therapy [see [ADVERSE REACTIONS](/arranon-drug.htm#AR)]. Based on patients with complete data, the median time to onset of first event is 5 days from start of first infusion (range: 1-166), and the median duration is 6 days (range: 1-393 days). Nervous system adverse reactions of any grade were reported for 69 (42%) pediatric patients across the Phase I and Phase II trials, and Grade 3 or higher (severe, life-threatening, or fatal) adverse reactions were reported for 25 (15%) patients following initiation of ARRANON therapy [see [ADVERSE REACTIONS](/arranon-drug.htm#AR)]. Based on patients with complete data, the median time to onset of first event is 8 days from start of first infusion (range: 1-269), and the median duration is 2 days (range: 1-82 days). Common signs and symptoms of ARRANON-related neurotoxicity include [somnolence](https://www.rxlist.com/somnolence/definition.htm), headache, [paresthesia](https://www.rxlist.com/paresthesia/definition.htm) and dysesthesia, dizziness, and motor), [cerebellar](https://www.rxlist.com/cerebellar/definition.htm) disturbances and [tremor](https://www.rxlist.com/tremor/definition.htm). Severe neurologic toxicity can manifest as coma, [status epilepticus](https://www.rxlist.com/status_epilepticus/definition.htm), craniospinal demyelination, or ascending neuropathy similar in presentation to Guillain-Barr\u00c3\u00a9 syndrome. Full recovery from these adverse reactions has not always occurred with cessation of therapy with ARRANON. Patients treated previously or concurrently with [intrathecal chemotherapy](https://www.rxlist.com/intrathecal_chemotherapy/definition.htm) or previously with craniospinal [irradiation](https://www.rxlist.com/irradiation/definition.htm) may be at increased risk for neurologic adverse events. Monitor patients frequently for signs and symptoms of neurologic toxicity during and for at least 24 hours after completion of treatment with ARRANON. Discontinue ARRANON for neurologic adverse reactions of NCI CTCAE Grade 2 or greater neutropenia, have been associated with ARRANON therapy. Complete blood counts including platelets should be monitored regularly [see [DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION](/arranon-drug.htm#DAA), [ADVERSE REACTIONS](/arranon-drug.htm#AR)]. Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animal studies, ARRANON can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see [CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY](/arranon-drug.htm#CP) ]. In animal reproduction studies,\u00c2 intravenous administration of nelarabine to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in teratogenicity at maternal doses below the recommended human adult dose of 1500 mg/m\u00b2/day (see Data). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ARRANON. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use condoms during treatment with ARRANON and for 3 months after the last dose [see Use In Specific Populations, Nonclinical Toxicology]. Tumor Lysis Syndrome Patients receiving ARRANON should receive intravenous hydration according to standard medical practice for the management of [hyperuricemia](https://www.rxlist.com/hyperuricemia/definition.htm) in patients at risk for tumor lysis syndrome. Consideration should be given to the use of allopurinol in patients at risk of hyperuricemia [see [DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION](/arranon-drug.htm#DAA)]. Vaccinations Avoid the administration of live [vaccines](https://www.rxlist.com/vaccines/definition.htm) to [immunocompromised](https://www.rxlist.com/immunocompromised/definition.htm) patients. Effects On Ability To Drive And Use Machines Patients treated with ARRANON may experience somnolence during and for several days after treatment [see [ADVERSE REACTIONS](/arranon-drug.htm#AR)]. Advise patients to refrain from driving or engaging in hazardous occupations or activities until somnolence has resolved. Patient Counseling Information Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling ( [PATIENT INFORMATION](/arranon-drug.htm#PI)). Hematologic Adverse Reactions - thrombocytopenia, anemia, and neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, have been associated with ARRANON. - Advise patients that complete blood counts, including platelets, will be monitored regularly during treatment [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, [ADVERSE REACTIONS](/arranon-drug.htm#AR)]. Embryo-Fetal Toxicity - Advise pregnant females of reproductive potential and males with female partners of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ARRANON. Instruct females to inform their physician of a known or suspected pregnancy. - Advise male patients with partners of reproductive potential to use condoms during treatment with ARRANON and for 3 months after the last dose [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, Use In Specific Populations]. Tumor Lysis Syndrome - Advise patients of the risk of tumor lysis syndrome [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, [ADVERSE REACTIONS](/arranon-drug.htm#AR)]. Vaccinations - Instruct patients not to receive live vaccines during treatment with ARRANON [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, [ADVERSE REACTIONS](/arranon-drug.htm#AR)]. Effects On Ability To Drive And Use Machines - Patients receiving ARRANON may experience somnolence during and for several days after treatment. Instruct patients to not drive or engage in hazardous occupations or activities until somnolence has resolved [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, [ADVERSE REACTIONS](/arranon-drug.htm#AR)]. Neurologic Adverse Reactions - Instruct patients to contact their physician if they experience new or worsening symptoms of [peripheral neuropathy](https://www.rxlist.com/peripheral_neuropathy/definition.htm)[see [BOXED WARNING](/arranon-drug.htm#BW), [DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION](/arranon-drug.htm#DAA), These signs and symptoms include: tingling or numbness in fingers, hands, toes, or feet; difficulty with the fine motor coordination tasks such as buttoning clothing; [unsteadiness](https://www.rxlist.com/unsteadiness/definition.htm)while walking; weakness arising from a low chair; weakness in climbing stairs; increased tripping while walking over uneven surfaces. - Advise patients of the risk of seizures [see [ADVERSE REACTIONS](/arranon-drug.htm#AR)]. If a [seizure](https://www.rxlist.com/seizure/definition.htm)occurs, instruct patients to promptly notify the physician administering ARRANON. Infection - Instruct patients to promptly notify their physician if they develop fever or signs of infection while on therapy [see [ADVERSE REACTIONS](/arranon-drug.htm#AR)]. Lactation - Advise women not to breastfeed treatment with ARRANON [see Use In Specific Populations]. Nonclinical Toxicology Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment Of Fertility Carcinogenicity testing of nelarabine has not been done. However, nelarabine was mutagenic when tested in vitro in L5178Y/TK mouse [lymphoma](https://www.rxlist.com/lymphoma/definition.htm) cells with and without metabolic activation. No studies have been conducted in animals to assess genotoxic potential or effects on fertility. The effect on human fertility is unknown. Use In Specific Populations Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animal studies, ARRANON can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see [CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY](/arranon-drug.htm#CP)]. Limited available data with ARRANON use in pregnant women are insufficient to determine a drug-associated risk for major birth defects, [miscarriage](https://www.rxlist.com/miscarriage/definition.htm) or adverse maternal, or fetal outcomes. There are risks to the pregnant woman associated with untreated [leukemia](https://www.rxlist.com/leukemia/definition.htm) or lymphoma (see Clinical Considerations). In animal reproduction studies, intravenous administration of nelarabine to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in teratogenicity at maternal doses below the recommended human adult dose of 1500 mg/m\u00b2/day (see Data). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of [birth defect](https://www.rxlist.com/birth_defect/definition.htm), loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal And/Or Embryo-fetal Risk There are risks to the mother from untreated leukemia or lymphoma, including anemia, thrombocytopenia, and death. Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal development study in which pregnant rabbits were administered daily doses of nelarabine during organogenesis, increased incidences of fetal malformations, anomalies, and variations were observed at doses greater than or equal to 360 mg/m\u00b2/day (8-hour IV infusion; approximately 25% of the recommended human adult dose compared on a mg/m\u00b2 basis), which was the lowest dose tested. [Cleft palate](https://www.rxlist.com/cleft_palate/definition.htm) was seen in rabbits given 3600 mg/m\u00b2/day (approximately 2-fold the adult dose), absent [pollices](https://www.rxlist.com/pollices/definition.htm) (digits) in rabbits given greater than or equal to 1200 mg/m\u00b2/day (approximately 75% of the recommended adult dose), while absent gall [bladder](https://www.rxlist.com/bladder/definition.htm), absent [accessory](https://www.rxlist.com/accessory/definition.htm) lung lobes, fused or extra sternebrae, and delayed [ossification](https://www.rxlist.com/ossification/definition.htm) was seen at all doses. Maternal body weight gain and fetal body weights were reduced in rabbits given 3600 mg/m\u00b2/day (approximately 2-fold the adult dose), but could not account for the increased incidence of malformations seen at this or lower administered doses. Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of nelarabine or ara-G in human or animal milk, the effect on the breastfed child, or the effect on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed child from ARRANON, such as severe [neurological](https://www.rxlist.com/neurological/definition.htm) reactions, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ARRANON. Females And Males Of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing ARRANON can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use In Specific Populations]. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to starting treatment with ARRANON. Contraception Females ARRANON can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, Use In Specific Populations]. Because of the potential for genotoxicity, advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ARRANON. Males Because of the potential for genotoxicity, advise males (including those who have had vasectomies) with female partners of reproductive potential to use condoms during treatment with ARRANON and for 3 months after the last dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology]. Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ARRANON for relapsed or [refractory](https://www.rxlist.com/refractory/definition.htm) T-ALL and T-LBL has been established in pediatric patients age 1 year and older. The effectiveness of ARRANON in pediatric patients is supported by one single-arm clinical trial, and safety has been asssessed in 165 pediatric patients age 1 year and older across multiple Phase I and Phase II trials. The trial establishing efficacy included 84 patients age 21 years and younger, who had relapsed or refractory T-ALL or T-LBL. The most frequent adverse reactions of any grade occurring on treatment in this study were hematologic laboratory abnormalities. Hematologic toxicity observed in the pediatric population was higher than that seen in the adult population [see [DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION](/arranon-drug.htm#DAA), [ADVERSE REACTIONS](/arranon-drug.htm#AR), [Clinical Studies](/arranon-drug.htm#CS)]. Nervous system adverse reactions have been reported for 42% of pediatric patients across the Phase I and Phase II trials. The incidence of nervous system adverse reactions was less in the pediatric population than that seen in adult patients with relapsed/refractory T-ALL/T-LBL [see [ADVERSE REACTIONS](/arranon-drug.htm#AR)]. In a phase III ARRANON in combination with multi-agent [chemotherapy](https://www.rxlist.com/chemotherapy/definition.htm) as first-line therapy, there were 411 patients with T-ALL or T-LBL treated with ARRANON. The safety profile in the 357 patients age 1 to 16 years was consistent with that seen in older patients in the study [see [ADVERSE REACTIONS](/arranon-drug.htm#AR)]. Due to lack of long-term follow up data, a determination of the impact of ARRANON on the growth and pubertal development of pediatric patients cannot be made. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of ARRANON did not include sufficient numbers of patients age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. In an exploratory analysis, increasing age, especially age 65 years and older, appeared to be associated with increased rates of neurologic adverse reactions. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection [see Use In Specific Populations]. Renal Impairment Ara-G clearance decreased as renal function decreased [see [CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY](/arranon-drug.htm#CP)]. Because the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with moderate (CLCr 30 to 50 mL/min) or severe (CLCr less than 30 mL/min) renal impairment, these patients should be closely monitored for toxicities when treated with ARRANON [see [DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION](/arranon-drug.htm#DAA)]. Hepatic Impairment The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of nelarabine has not been evaluated. Because the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubingreater than 3 times upper limit of normal), these patients should be closely monitored for toxicities when treated with ARRANON. OVERDOSE There is no known [antidote](https://www.rxlist.com/antidote/definition.htm) for overdoses of ARRANON. It is anticipated that overdosage would result in severe neurotoxicity (possibly including [paralysis](https://www.rxlist.com/paralysis/definition.htm), coma), myelosuppression, and potentially death. In the event of overdose, supportive care consistent with good clinical practice should be provided. At a dose of 2200 mg/m\u00b2 given on Days 1, 3, and 5 every 21 days, 2 patients developed a significant Grade 3 ascending sensory neuropathy. [Magnetic resonance imaging](https://www.rxlist.com/magnetic_resonance_imaging/definition.htm) evaluations of the 2 patients demonstrated findings consistent with a demyelinating process in the [cervical](https://www.rxlist.com/cervical/definition.htm) spine. CONTRAINDICATIONS None. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism Of Action Nelarabine is a deoxyguanosinekinase and deoxycytidine kinase, and subsequently converted active 5\u00e2\u20ac-triphosphate, ara-GTP. Accumulation of ara-GTP in leukemic [blasts](https://www.rxlist.com/blasts/definition.htm) allows for incorporation into deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), leading to inhibition of DNA synthesis and cell death. Other mechanisms may contribute to the cytotoxic and systemic toxicity of nelarabine. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following intravenous administration of nelarabine to adult patients with refractory leukemia or lymphoma, plasma ara-G Cmax values generally occurred at the end of the nelarabine infusion and were generally higher than nelarabine Cmax values, suggesting rapid and extensive conversion of nelarabine to ara-G. Mean plasma nelarabine and ara-G 3.0 mcg/mL 5.6 mcg/mL, respectively, after a 1500 mg/m\u00b2 nelarabine dose infused over 2 hours in adult patients. The area under the concentrationtime curve (AUC) of ara-G is 37 times higher than that for nelarabine on Day 1 after nelarabine IV infusion of 1500 mg/m\u00b2 dose (162 \u00b1 49 mcg.h/mL versus 4.4 \u00b1 2.2 mcg.h/mL, respectively). Comparable Cmax and AUC values were obtained for nelarabine between Days 1 and 5 at the nelarabine adult dosage of 1500 mg/m\u00b2, indicating that nelarabine does not accumulate after multiple-dosing. There are not enough ara-G data to make a comparison between Day 1 and Day 5. After a nelarabine adult dose of 1500 mg/m\u00b2, intracellular Cmax for ara- GTP appeared within 3 to 25 hours on Day 1. Exposure (AUC) to intracellular ara-GTP was 532 times higher than that for nelarabine and 14 times higher than that for ara-G (2,339 \u00b1 2,628 mcg.h/mL 49 mcg.h/mL, respectively). Because the intracellular levels of ara-GTP were so prolonged, its elimination half-life could not be accurately estimated. Distribution Nelarabine and ara-G are extensively distributed throughout the body. For nelarabine, VSS values were 197 \u00b1 216 L/m\u00b2 in adult patients. For ara-G, VSS/F values were 50 \u00b1 24 L/m\u00b2 in adult patients. Nelarabine and ara-G are not substantially bound to human plasma proteins (< 25%) in vitro, and binding is independent of nelarabine or ara-G concentrations up to 600 M. Metabolism The principal route of [metabolism](https://www.rxlist.com/metabolism/definition.htm) for nelarabine is O-demethylation by ADA to form ara-G, which undergoes hydrolysis to form [guanine](https://www.rxlist.com/guanine/definition.htm). In addition, some nelarabine is hydrolyzed to form methylguanine, which is O-demethylated to form guanine. Guanine is N-deaminated to form [xanthine](https://www.rxlist.com/xanthine/definition.htm), is to yield [uric acid](https://www.rxlist.com/uric_acid/definition.htm). Excretion Nelarabine and ara-G are partially eliminated kidneys. Mean urinary excretion of nelarabine and ara-G was 6.6 \u00b1 4.7% and 27 \u00b1 15% of the administered dose, respectively, in 28 adult patients over the 24 hours after nelarabine infusion on Day 1. Renal clearance averaged 24 \u00b1 23 L/h for nelarabine and 6.2 \u00b1 5.0 L/h for ara-G in 21 adult patients. Combined Phase I pharmacokinetic data at nelarabine doses of 199 to 2900 mg/m\u00b2 (n = 66 adult patients) indicate that the mean clearance (CL) of nelarabine is 197 \u00b1 189 L/h/m\u00b2 on Day 1. The apparent clearance of ara-G (CL/F) is 10.5 \u00b1 4.5 L/h/m\u00b2 on Day 1. Nelarabine and ara-G are rapidly eliminated from plasma with a mean half-life of 18 minutes and 3.2 hours, respectively, in adult patients. Pediatrics No pharmacokinetic data are available in pediatric patients at the once-daily 650 mg/m\u00b2 nelarabine dosage. Combined Phase I pharmacokinetic data at nelarabine doses of 104 to 2900 mg/m\u00b2 indicate that the mean clearance (CL) of nelarabine is about 30% higher in pediatric patients than in adult patients (259 \u00b1 409 L/h/m\u00b2 versus 197 \u00b1 189 L/h/m\u00b2, respectively) (n = 66 adults, n = 22 pediatric patients) on Day 1. The apparent clearance of ara-G (CL/F) is comparable between the 2 groups (10.5 \u00b1 4.5 L/h/m\u00b2 in adult patients and 11.3 \u00b1 4.2 L/h/m\u00b2 in pediatric patients) on Day 1. Nelarabine and ara-G are extensively distributed throughout the body. For nelarabine, VSS values were 213 \u00b1 358 L/m\u00b2 in pediatric For ara-G, VSS/F values were 33 \u00b1 9.3 L/m\u00b2 in pediatric patients. Nelarabine and ara-G are rapidly eliminated from plasma in pediatric patients, with a half-life of 13 minutes and 2 hours, respectively. Effect Of Age Age has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of nelarabine or ara-G in adults. Decreased renal function, which is more common in the elderly, may reduce ara-G clearance [see [Use In Specific Populations](/arranon-drug.htm#USP)]. Effect Of Gender Gender has no effect on nelarabine or ara-G pharmacokinetics. Effect Of Race In general, nelarabine mean clearance and volume of distribution values tend to be higher in whites (n = 63) than in blacks (by about 10%) (n = 15). The opposite is true for ara-G; mean apparent clearance and volume of distribution values tend to be lower in whites than in blacks (by about 15% to 20%). No differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these groups. Effect Of Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of nelarabine and ara-G have not been specifically studied in renally impaired or hemodialyzed patients. Nelarabine is excreted by the kidney to a small extent (5% to 10% of the administered dose). Ara-G is excreted by the kidney to a greater extent (20% to 30% of the administered nelarabine dose). In the combined Phase I trials, patients were categorized into 3 groups: normal with CLCr greater than 80 mL/min (n = 67), mild with CLCr = 50 to 80 mL/min (n = 15), and moderate with CLCr less than 50 mL/min (n = 3). The mean apparent clearance (CL/F) of ara-G was about 15% and 40% lower in patients with mild and moderate renal impairment, respectively, than in patients with normal renal function [see [Use In Specific Populations](/arranon-drug.htm#USP), [DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION](/arranon-drug.htm#DAA)]. No differences in safety or effectiveness were observed. Effect Of Hepatic Impairment The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of nelarabine has not been evaluated [see [Use Populations](/arranon-drug.htm#USP)]. Drug Interactions Cytochrome P450: Nelarabine and ara-G did not significantly inhibit of nelarabine and ara-G up to 100 M. Fludarabine Administration of fludarabine 30 mg/m\u00b2 as a 30-minute infusion 4 hours before a 1200-mg/m\u00b2 infusion of nelarabine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of nelarabine, ara-G, or ara-GTP in 12 patients with refractory leukemia. Pentostatin There is in vitro evidence that pentostatin is a strong inhibitor of ADA. Inhibition of ADA may result in a reduction in the conversion of the prodrug nelarabine to its active moiety and consequently in a reduction in efficacy of nelarabine and/or change in adverse reaction profile of either drug [see [DRUG INTERACTIONS](/arranon-drug.htm#DI)]. Clinical Studies Adult Clinical Trial In Relapsed Or Refractory T-ALL And T-LBL The safety and efficacy of ARRANON in adult patients were studied in a clinical trial which included 39 treated patients, 28 who had T-ALL or T-LBL that had relapsed following or was refractory to at least two prior induction regimens. A 1500-mg/m\u00b2 dose of ARRANON was administered intravenously over 2 hours on Days 1, 3, and 5 repeated every 21 days. Patients who experienced signs or symptoms of Grade 2 or greater neurologic toxicity on therapy were to be discontinued from further therapy with ARRANON. Seventeen patients had a diagnosis of T-ALL and 11 had a diagnosis of T-LBL. For patients with 2 prior inductions, the age range was 16 to 65 years (mean: 34 years) and most patients were male (82%) and Caucasian (61%). Patients with central nervous system (CNS) disease were not eligible. Complete response (CR) in this trial was defined as bone marrow blast counts 5%, no other evidence of disease, and full recovery of peripheral blood counts. Complete response without complete hematologic recovery (CR*) was also assessed. The results of the trial for patients who had received 2 prior inductions are shown in Table 5. Table 5: Efficacy Results in Adult Patients With 2 Prior Inductions Treated With 1500 mg/m\u00b2 of ARRANON Administered Intravenously Over 2 Hours on Days 1, 3, and 5 Repeated Every 21 Days |N = 28| |CR complete interval; | CR*, complete response without hematologic recovery. a Does not include 1 patient who was transplanted (duration of response was 156+ weeks). The mean number of days on therapy was 56 days (range of 10 to 136 days). Time to CR plus CR* ranged from 2.9 to 11.7 weeks. Pediatric Clinical Trial In Relapsed Or Refractory T-ALL And T-LBL The safety and efficacy of ARRANON in pediatric patients were studied in a clinical trial which included patients age 21 years and younger, who had relapsed or refractory T-ALL or T-LBL. Eighty-four (84) patients, 39 of whom had received two or more prior induction regimens, were treated with 650 mg/m\u00b2/day of ARRANON administered intravenously over 1 hour daily for 5 consecutive days repeated every 21 days (see Table 6). Patients who experienced signs or symptoms of Grade 2 or greater neurologic toxicity on therapy were to be discontinued from further therapy with ARRANON. Table 6: Pediatric Clinical Trial - Patient Allocation |Patient Population||N| |Patients treated at 650 mg/m\u00b2/day x 5 days, every 21 days||84| |Patients with T-ALL or T-LBL with two or more prior induction treated at 650 mg/m\u00b2/day x 5 days, every 21 days||39| |Patients with T-ALL or T-LBL with one prior induction treated at 650 mg/m\u00b2/day x 5 days, 84 patients ranged in age from 2.5 to 21.7 years (overall mean: 11.9 years), 52% were 3 to 12 years of age and most were male (74%) and Caucasian (62%). The majority (77%) of patients had a diagnosis of T-ALL. Complete response (CR) in this trial was defined as bone marrow blast counts 5%, no other evidence of disease, and full recovery of peripheral blood counts. Complete response without full hematologic recovery(CR*) was also assessed as a meaningful outcome in this trial. Duration of response is reported from date of response to date of relapse, and may include subsequent stem cell transplant. Efficacy results are presented in Table 7.
