Traditional medicines already comprise a multi - billion dollar, international i ndustry, and the biomedical sector is increasingly investigating the potential of genetic resources and traditional knowledge . Documenting and protecting these medicines is becoming a greater priority . Traditional knowledge has historically been at odd s with modern intellectual property systems designed to protect innovations such as new pharmaceutical drugs . However, as the financial value of many forms of traditional medicine becomes recognized, traditional knowledge holders and nations rich in genet ic resources are arguing for greater protection through non -conventional systems of intellectual property protection . Traditional knowledge holders are increasingly demanding fair and equitable distribution of benefits from the commercialization of tradit ional medicine, as well as the prior informed consent of indigenous people s to prevent misappropriation . Many problems associated with the protection of traditional medical knowledge lack clear solutions . In attempting to protect traditional medicine, traditional knowledge holders are confronted by a confusing and diverse group of national and international policies, regulatory systems designed primarily to accommodate pharmaceutical medicines, safety and efficacy concerns, and challenges to ownership . This text is designed to assist traditional medical knowledge holders, government representatives and third -party collaborators to think about issues of intellectual property law specifically related to traditional medical knowledge . It is not intended to provide legal advice, but rather to help stimulate thinking about traditional knowledge and to provide illustrative case studies . There is no generic way to protect traditional medical knowledge . Traditional knowledge holders should carefully consi der identified community goals for the use of traditional medicine and the risks and benefits of documentation . Whether traditional medical knowledge is documented can have far reaching consequences on intellectual property protection, commercialization a nd promotion of traditional medicine, regulatory submissions and interactions with collaborators . It is important that traditional knowledge holders be adequately informed to safeguard their reputations and interests when interacting with third parties . Hopefully, this text will help traditional knowledge holders better understand the issues related to traditional medicine and intellectual property and make informed decisions about the best use of their knowledge . 2 LIST OF ABBREVIATION S ABS Access and Benefit -Sharing CAM Complementary and Alternative Medicine CBD Convention on Biological Diversity CGEN Council for the Management of Genetic Patrimony (Brazil) CSIR Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (India) EMA European Medicines Agency EU European Union FDA Food and Drug Administration (United States of America ) GAO Government Accountability Office (United States of America ) GMPs Good Manufacturing Practices GRs Genetic Resources INDECOPI National Institute for th e Defense of Competition and Intellectual Property Protection (Peru) IP Intellectual Property IPC International Patent Classification IPO International Patent Office IPR Intellectual Property Right NCCAM National Center for Complementary and Altern ative Medicine (United States of America ) NDA New Drug Application SATCM State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine (China) SFDA State Food and Drug Administration (China) SIPO State Intellectual Property Office (China) TCM Traditional Chinese Medicine TK Traditional Knowledge TKDB Traditional Knowledge Database TKDL Traditional Knowledge Digital Library TKRC Traditional Knowledge Resource Classification TM Traditional Medicine TMK Traditional Medical Knowledge TRIPS Trade -Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights UNIFESP Federal University of S\u00e3o Paulo (Brazil) USD United States of America Dollar USPTO United States of America Patent and Trademark Office WHA World Health Assembly WHO World Health Organization WIPO World Intellectual Property Organization WTO World Trade Organization 3 I. INTRODUCTION TO TRAD ITIONAL MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE 1. TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDG E Traditional knowledge (TK) is a difficult concept to define because it encompasses such diversity . TK, or indigenous knowledge, covers wide ranging subject areas from art to agriculture, as well as medicinal use s of plants and traditional systems of medical diagnosis . It may exist in indigenous or local communities as secret oral traditions that have been passed down over generations, but it may also be documented in publicly available written or even electronic media . There is no generally accepted definition of TK at the international level . As a broad description of subject matter, \"traditional k nowledge\" generally includes the intellectual and intangible cultural heritage, practices and knowledge systems of traditional communities, including indigenous and local communities . In other words, TK in a general sense embraces the content of knowledge itself as well as traditional cultural expressions, including distinctive signs and symbols associated with TK . \"Traditional knowledge\" in a narrower sense refers to knowledge as such, in particular the knowledge resulting from intellectual activity in a traditional context, and includes know -how, practices, skills, and innovations . Traditional knowledge can be found in a wide variety of contexts, including: agricultural knowledge; scientific knowledge; technical knowledge; ecological knowledge; medicina l knowledge, including related medicines and remedies; and biodiversity -related knowledge .1 2. TRADITIONAL MEDICINE Traditional medicine (TM) describes a group of health care practices and products with a long history of use. It frequently refers to medical knowledge developed by indigenous cultures that incorporates plant, animal and mineral -based medicines, spiritual therapies and manual techniques designed to treat illness or maintain wellbeing.2 TM tends to be practiced outside of allopathic medi cine (also known as biomedicine, conventional or Western medicine), which is the dominant system of medicine in the developed world. In many cultures, TM functions as a comprehensive system of health care refined over hundreds or even thousands of years. Some of the best -known TM systems include traditional Indian (Ayurveda) medicine, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), and traditional Arabic (Unani) medicine. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines traditional medicine as \" the sum total of the knowledge, skills and practices based on the theories, beliefs and experiences indigenous to different cultures , whether explicable or not, used in the maint enance of health, as well as in the prevent ion, diagnos is, improve ment or treat ment of physical and mental illnesses.\"3 1 WIPO's current working definition of traditional knowledge, \"refers to the content or substance of knowledge resulting from intellectual activity in a traditional context, and includes the know -how, skills, innovations, practices and learning that form part of traditional knowledge systems, and knowledge embodying traditional lifestyles of indigenous and local communities, or contained in codified knowledge systems passed between generations. It is not limited to any specific technical field, and may include agricultural, environmental and medicinal knowledge, and any traditional knowledge associated with genetic resources.\" World Intellectual Property Organization [WIPO], Intergovernmental Committee on Intellectual Property and Genetic Resources, Tradition al Knowledge and Folklore, Glossary of Key Terms Related to Intellectual Property and Genetic Resources, Traditional Knowledge and Traditional Cultural Expressions, WIPO/GRTKF/IC/20/INF/7, Annex, page, (January 10, 2011). 2 World Health Organization [WHO], \"Fact Sheet No. 134: Traditional Medicine,\" (May http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/2003/fs134/en/. 3 WHO/EDM/TRM/2000.1, 2000, TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE (TCM) TCM is one of the most widely used and studied systems of traditional medicine.4 TCM, like many other forms of traditional medicine, differs from allopathic medicine in more than its techniques. It is modeled on a fundamentally different way of looking at health and disease. Practitioners of TCM utilize a unique system of diagnosis that includes a comprehensive history of symptoms to arrive at an underlying disharmony.5 Treatments focus on increasing the body's natural defenses through acupuncture, herbal medicine and physical manipulation. TCM considers that mind, body, spirit an d the external environment all have a strong role in creating health or disease. Patients are made active participants in their own care through recommendations for lifestyle changes, body -mind exercises such as Tai Chi and Qi Gong, and nutrition and diet ary therapy. 3. COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) describes a group of health care systems, practices and products not presently considered to be part of allopathic medicine.6 CAM includes traditiona l medicine, as well as modern practices developed outside of indigenous communities. Sometimes the two terms are used synonymously, or TM may be referred to as CAM when it is adopted outside of its traditional culture.7 CAM systems and therapies may be g rouped into broad categories such as natural products, mind -body medicine, and manipulative and body -based practices.8 4. CHARACTERISTICS O F TRADITIONAL MEDICI NE TM practices, particularly whole medical systems such as TCM, share many of the same core v alues.9 These practices tend to be characterized by a holistic and highly individualized approach to treatment, an emphasis on maximizing the body's inherent healing ability, involving patients as active participants in their own care, addressing physical , mental, and spiritual attributes of a disease, and placing a strong emphasis on prevention and wellness.10 At the same time, TM practices display considerable diversity and can vary significantly between regions. TM therapies involve assorted levels of training and have different degrees of evidence -base and efficacy. In addition, TM practices are governed by a heterogeneous group of state and national policies and regulations and have a variety of associated cultural beliefs. As opposed to relativel y modern CAM practices, traditional medicines have the benefit of substantial prior clinical use as well as stronger cultural associations.

IMPORTANCE OF TRA DITIONAL MEDICINE FO R INDIGENOUS PEOPLES AND LOCAL CO MMUNITIES Traditional medicine is not only a vital source of health care, but also an im portant source of income for many communities. Traditional medicine may even form an integral part of a community's identity. Pre-industrial communities have been responsible for the discovery of most of the medicinal plants in use today, and many comm unities are still involved in the wild collection, domestication, cultivation and management of medicinal plant resources.13 This economic activity supports many indigenous peoples and local communities, a benefit that in turn provides incentives for the conservation of TM. While some medicinal plants are cultivated commercially, most continue to be collected from the wild.14 CORDYCEPS SINESIS IN TIBET Cordyceps sinesis is an herbal medicine used as a general tonic and aphrodisiac in systems of traditio nal Asian medicine such as TCM.15 The herb is a parasitic fungus that feeds primarily on insects such as caterpillars. When spores come into contact with a germinating caterpillar the fungus will invade the caterpillar's body, killing the insect and repla cing the host tissue. Gathering this herb represents the primary source of income for many Tibetans,16 and it has become a more significant source of income as growing international demand has caused Cordyceps prices to rise substantially over the past t wenty years.17 The Tibetan Cordyceps harvesting season begins in April and lasts until the end of June, during which time gatherers comb ground in the wild for Cordyceps to extract.18 The herb is difficult to see and gathering requires concentration and pa tience. Demand for Cordyceps has recently declined due to the global economic crisis, and this may have a harmful effect on Tibetan communities. Lack of infrastructure for sustainable harvesting may also have a negative long term economic impact. 11 Directive 2004/24/EC, 2004 O.J.

Cordyceps Sinensis Medicinal Fungus Traditional Use among Tibetan People, Harvesting Techniques and Modern Uses. 83 HerbalGram 53-61, 54 (2009) . 6 Indigenous peoples and local communities may possess knowledge related to harvesting and preparing herbs, as well as knowledge on medicinal use. This information can be invaluable, not only to the indigenous peoples and local communities who have historic ally used herbal medicines, but also for any attempt to export and use medicine outside of its traditional environment. TMK may also contribute to a community's way of life and spiritual beliefs. For example, traditional African medicine is characteriz ed by a holistic world -view that embraces people, animals, plants, and inanimate objects in an inseparable whole from which all beings derive their life force.19 Traditional African medicine may involve spiritual healing, a process thought to be mediated t hrough spiritual or divine powers. The majority of people in Africa living with HIV/AIDS depend on traditional healers and herbal treatments for psychosocial counseling and health care.20 MAGIC AND MEDICINE I N ZIMBABWE In Zimbabwean traditional medicine, therapeutic herbs are considered supernatural.21 However, magical properties only become effective when a healer incorporates a system of rituals, divinations and symbols into treatment. In addition to the traditional healer, the entire local so ciety plays a role in the effectiveness of the healing magic. Access to the traditional medical system begins when a healer selects a family member to assist in practice.22 The apprenticeship teaches a future practitioner how to identify, prepare and use traditional herbs, a system for diagnosing and treating illness, and lessons in cultural and social practices. Elders grant access to TMK through ceremonies where knowledg e is revealed as a gift. While general knowledge of the healing properties of medicinal plants may be widespread, only a select group of trained practitioners knows exactly how herbs are used in the traditional system. 19 Jaco Homsy et al, Defining minimum standards of practice for incorporating African traditional medicine into HIV/AIDS preventio n, care, and support: a regional initiative in eastern and southern Africa, 10 The Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine 905-910 (2004). 20 UNAIDS, Ancient Remedies, New Disease: Increasing Access to AIDS Prevention and Care in collaboration wit h traditional healers, (June 2002), at 7. 21 World Bank, Cultural rights for Zimbabwe's Sui Generis Legislation - Emphasizing symbolic practice related to t raditional medicinal knowledge, IK Notes No. 57, June 2003, at 2.

TRADITIONAL MEDICI NE WORLDWIDE The last two decades have witnessed globally renewed interest in the use of traditional and complementary and alternative medicine. A recent study of CAM use in the U.S. population reported that in 2007, almost 4 out of 10 adults had used some form of CAM within the past year.23 It was estimated that Americans spent 33.9 billion U.S. dollars (USD) out-of-pocket on CAM products and services during the prior year, accounting for 11.2 percent of total out -of-pocket health care expenditures.24 In other developed nations the use of CAM is equally extensive.25 The use of traditional medicine is even more substantial in the developing world. According to data provided to WHO, i n India 70 percent of the population and in Ethiopia more than 90 percent of the population depend on TM for p rimary health care.26 It is reported that more than 70 percent of the population in Chile and 40 percent of the population in Colombia have used traditional medicine.27 In China, traditional medicine accounts for approximately 40 percent of all health care delivered.28 2. SAFETY ISSUES The use of traditional medicine presents unique public health challenges. WHO notes that \"inappropriate use of traditional medicines or practices can have negative or dangerous effects\" and that \"further research is needed to ascertain the efficacy and safety\" of many traditional medical practices.29 Traditional medicines are not necessarily safe simply because they are \"natural\" and have a long history of use. The use of traditional medicines may delay the use of effecti ve allopathic treatments, and it can directly cause adverse effects. Health risks may be posed by drug -herb interactions and problems related to quality control.30 To keep these risks in 23 Patricia M.

Martha R Harkey et al., Variability in Commercial Ginseng Products: An Analysis of 25 Preparations, 73 AM. J. CLIN NUTR. 1101, 1101 (2001). More seriously, a significant number of herbal products have been found to contain pharmaceuticals. Edzard Ernst, Adulteration of Chinese Herbal Medicines with Synthetic Drugs: A Systematic Review, 252 J. Intern Med 107, 1 07 (2002). In December 2008, the FDA issued a warning to consumers nationwide advising them to avoid a list of 60 dietary supplements that were found to contain undeclared drugs. An FDA analysis of these supplements uncovered active pharmaceutical ingredie nts far in excess of FDA -recommended levels, including an anti -seizure medication, a suspected carcinogen, and a drug not approved for marketing in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration [FDA], FDA Expands Warning to Consumers About Tainted Weight Loss Pill s List increases from 28 to 60 products; Agency seeking recalls, http://www.fda.gov/newsevents/newsroom/pressannouncements/2008/ucm116998.htm (last visited Sept 29, 2013). In 2005 researchers purchased 230 traditional Ayurvedic herbal medicines available o nline for sale in the U.S. and tested these products for the presence of heavy metals. Nearly 21 percent were found to contain lead, mercury or arsenic. Claims by manufacturers that they used Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) or metal testing were not ass ociated with a lower prevalence of heavy metals. RB Saper et al., Lead, Mercury, and Arsenic in U.S. and Indian -manufactured Ayurvedic Medicines Sold via the Internet, 300(8) JAMA 915 -923, 915 (2008). The issue of adulteration and contamination, particular ly from Asian 8 perspective, it should be noted that despite the widespread use of t raditional medicine, reports of serious adverse effects are rare.31 GOOD MANUFACTURING P RACTICES Good manufacturing practices (GMPs) help to ensure that products are consistently manufactured with appropriate quality standards. In the case of pharmaceuti cals, marketing authorities such as the European Medicines Agency (EMA) set standards for drug manufacturing. GMPs aim to diminish risks related to contamination and mislabeling, and to ensure a certain standard of safety and efficacy. GMPs may require r igorous documentation of production methods, and the use of particular manufacturing and testing equipment. WHO good manufacturing practices are used by pharmaceutical manufacturers and regulators in over one hundred countries worldwide, primarily in th e developing world. The EMA and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) GMP requirements in certain cases apply more rigorous standards. Other developed regions have GMP requirements similar to the EMA and U.S. FDA. Many countries do not require m anufacturers of traditional medicines to adhere to GMPs. As a result, manufacturers may be only responsible for making a good faith effort to ensure products contain pure substances that are not contaminated, weakened or mislabeled.32 Enforcing GMPs may help address the issue of contaminated or adulterated supplements. GMPs provide requirements for the manufacturing of herbs that encompass quality control of materials, accurate identification of medicinal plants species, and procedures for harvesting and storing herbs.33 WHO has long advocated that ensuring GMPs is a critical part of effective national policies on herbal medicine.34 The United States of America has only recently begun requiring manufacturers of dietary supplements to adhere to GMPs. The U.S. FDA proposed rules for GMPs in 2003,35 but nothing was adopted until 2007.36 These rules set requirements for domestically marketed herbs that include meeti ng specifications for identity, purity, strength and composition.37 The principal drawback to requiring GMPs is that they may have prohibitive costs. In particular, rules based on a pharmaceutical model (such as those originally proposed by the FDA in 2003) may put many small to medium -sized manufacturers out of business.38 High-profile cases of adverse effects from herbal supplements have demonstrated the potential dangers of poorly regulated traditional medicine. sources, is not limited to herbal medicine. National attention has recently been focused on this matter in the aftermath of incidents related to infant formula, pet food, and toothpaste contamination. 31 D.H.

TCM practitioners use herbs to treat patients under the guidance of TCM theory and traditional Chinese pharmacology. When appropriately prepared and used, traditional Chinese herbs are generally safe and effective. However, if used without proper guidance, significant adverse effects may occur. The use of herbs, including their active ingredients, without appropriate diagnosis and outside of traditional guidelines sho uld not be considered traditional medicine.39 Ephedra Sinica is one of the oldest and most commonly used medicines in the Chinese herbal pharmacopeia. It was included as one of more than 360 herbs in the first herbal compendium written more than 2,000 years ago. TCM practitioners had recognized that Ephedra was c apable of causing side -effects or toxic reactions at high concentrations. An important therapeutic agent in TCM, Ephedra was only used for certain conditions at recommended dosages, and generally in combination with other herbs believed to mitigate its to xicity.40 It is usually prescribed by TCM practitioners in combination with other herbs to treat conditions including asthma, nasal congestion and eczema. In the 1980s and 1990s, some dietary supplement manufacturers began using Ephedra as a component of weight -loss and athletic enhancement supplements, without regard for its traditional use, dosage or contraindications.41 Despite the fact that Ephedra was known to raise blood pressure and act as a stimulant to the cardiovascular and cen tral nervous systems,42 supplements containing Ephedra were marketed broadly without health warnings or restrictions. Furthermore, these supplements were of highly variable quality and concentration; an examination of Ephedra containing supplements reveale d 18-fold variations in the content of ephedrine and ephedrine -like substances.43 Ultimately, these supplements caused a large number of adverse effects, including heart attacks, strokes and even death.44 The use of Ephedra was eventually banned in the Uni ted States of America.45 Ephedra sinica has been used in TCM for thousands of years. However, as a result of Ephedra's misuse, U.S. practitioners of TCM are no longer able to prescribe this herbal medicine. 3. BIG BUSINESS AND NEW DRUG DEVELOPMENT The widespread use of TM has resulted in traditional health care becoming a lucrative, multinational business. Billions of U .S. dollars are spent annually on traditional medicine in many developed countries. For example, in 2012, 32 billion dollars was s pent in the United States of America on dietary supplements, an amount projected to increase to 60 billion dollars in 2021.46 In developing countries, more money may be spent on TM than on 39 Ka Kit Hui, Ephedra sinica in the Practice of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Report for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (December 1999), at 1, available at http://cewm.med.ucla.edu/wp - content/uploads/1999HuiKEphedraSinicaTCM.pdf . 40 Id. at 3. 41 Id. at 6. 42 Christina A.

As much as one -third to one -half of pharmaceutical drugs was originally derived from plants.48 Some prominent examples include digitalis, a popular cardiac medication, identified as the active component of the foxglo ve leaf; morphine and codeine, which alleviate pain, derived from cultivated opium poppy; and atropine, for disorders involving the autonomic nervous system, from the nightshade plant. The anti - cancer drug Taxol was derived from the bark of the Pacific ye w tree, and Aspirin was isolated from willow bark.49 Traditional medicine does more than provide raw materials for pharmaceuticals \u2014 holders of traditional knowledge often have valuable knowledge for new drug development. New drug development is an expensi ve and risky venture. Pharmaceutical companies invest billions of dollars annually in the hope of developing new chemical entities that are safe and effective, and that can be manufactured in a cost effective way. It is estimated that for every 10,000 pu re compounds that are biologically evaluated, only one achieves regulatory approval.50 A single approval can take upwards of a decade and cost hundreds of millions of dollars.51 Traditional knowledge can provide valuable guidance in selecting and obtaining plant material of potential therapeutic interest. Bioactive compounds derived from currently used herbal medicines are more likely to have minimal toxicity, and a long history of clinical use suggests that a herbal medicine may be clinically effective. Plant -derived compounds used as drugs are generally used in ways that correlate directly with their traditional uses as plant medicines.52 MALARIA AND HERBAL M EDICINE Malaria is one of the most common infectious diseases and a major public health problem in many developing countries. Half of the world's population is at risk of malaria, and an estimated 247 million cases led to nearly a million deaths in 2006.53 One hundred and nine countries were endemic for malaria in 2008, 45 within the WHO African reg ion. Malaria also causes significant economic damage in high -rate areas, and disproportionately affects poor people who cannot afford treatment or have limited access to health care.54 Traditional medicines are the source of some modern antimalarial drug s (artemisinin and quinine derivatives). Artemisinin was isolated in 197 2 as the active ingredient of the plant Artemisia annua , and this innovation relied upon the Chinese traditional medical text, \"Handbook of Prescriptions for Emergencies\", written in the 3rd century A.D.55 Artemisia annua had been used to treat malaria in China for thousands of years. 47 WHO TM Strategy, supra note 4, at 2. 48 B.

EXPORTING TRADITI ONAL MEDICINE Traditional medicine is commercialized and exported in a variety of settings. Some TM holders have chosen to market their knowledge outside of traditional settings. China, for example, promotes global TCM use to foster domestic economic development. Exports of TCM products from China generate billions of U.S. dollars in revenue annually.57 China's situation is not unique. In 2004, China accounted for only five percent of the global market for TM.58 Biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies also make use of genetic resources (GRs) and TMK in new drug development. GRs are screened for potential medical benefits, and increasingly TMK is used to improve screening. This process is sometimes referred to as \"bioprospecting,\" the development of new therapeutics from products of nature. On the one hand, bioprospecting can be beneficial to indigenous communities and developing countries. National governments and local communities may receive a portion of revenue from the sale of new medicines developed from traditional resources, and this revenue can support the conservation and sustainable use of biological resources. On the other hand, if unregulated, bioprospecting can result i n over -exploitation of limited resources. Habitats that support medicinal plants are being destroyed by over -harvesting and new commercial developments. Many traditional medicines now face extinction with serious consequences for local communities. For example, licorice root, \"without a doubt the most commonly used Chinese herb\"59 is now threatened. Licorice root is now grown in less than half its previous area as a result of excessive harvesting and habitat destruction.60 GRs and TMK may also be misappropriated when third parties use them without the informed consent of TK holders and without equitable benefit -sharing. Where bioprospecting occurs without benefit -sharing or the consent of source communities it is sometimes referred to as \"biopiracy\" . Developing countries are increasingly making efforts to protect GRs and TMK through national legislation and international agreements. However, guarding these resources has historically proven challenging due to a lack of nati onal and international regulations and the need for law enforcement. 56 WHO, Guidelines for the Treatment of Malaria, Second Edition, (2010), at ix, available at http://whqlibdoc.w ho.int/publications/2010/9789241547925_eng.pdf. 57 Overview of Chinese Pharmaceutical Market in 1999 and 2000 , Chinese Medical News, issue 107.

MISAPPROPRIATION TMK holders have historically experienced misappropriation from foreign and even domestic developers. In recent years, unauthorized third parties have pa tented traditional medicine based products without the consent of TMK holders and without fair compensation. A prominent example includes the patenting of turmeric in the United States of America. TURMERIC IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Turmeric ( Curcuma longa ) is an herb traditionally used in Ayurvedic medicine. It is applied as an antiseptic for cuts, burns and bruises, taken internally for digestive disorders, and applied topically for skin disorders. In 1995, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) granted a patent to the University of Mississippi Medical Center for the medicinal use of turmeric. The patent on \"Use of Turmeric in Wound Healing\" covered \"a method of promoting healing of a wound by administering turmeric to a patient af flicted with the wound\" . The patent application claimed that this was the first use of turmeric for such a purpose. The issuance of this patent generated international controversy, particularly in India, where it was felt that traditional Indian medici ne was being misappropriated. The ensuing public outcry prompted the Indian government to request that the patent be revoked on the basis of lack of novelty due to its known traditional use. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research of India (CSI R) provided scientific literature documenting prior use of turmeric for wound healing, including an ancient Sanskrit text and a paper published in 1953 in the Journal of the Indian Medical Association.61 The patent application for turmeric disseminated TMK . In helping defeat the patent, the Indian government provided evidence that this use of turmeric was not innovative. Because novelty is a necessary requirement for patent protection, it is now difficult for any party to patent the use of turmeric for wo und healing or to require compensation for this use. The Indian government is now comprehensively documenting TMK in its Traditional Knowledge Digital Library (TKDL) to help defeat patent applications it views as inappropriate. It is restricting this dat a from public access in part to protect potential intellectual property rights (IPRs). 61 Karen Timme rmans, TRIPS, CBD, and Traditional Medicines: Concepts: Concepts and Questions, Report of an Asean Workshop on the TRIPS Agreement and Traditional Medicine (February 13 -15, 2001), available at http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Jh2996e/6.4.html. 13 III. NATIONAL AND IN TERNATIONAL POLICIES ON TRADITIONAL MEDICINE 1. BEIJING DECLARATI ON In Beijing in November 2008, government officials representing Member States of WHO adopted a declaration that provides an endorsement of traditional medicine. The WHO Congress on Traditional Medicine was the first time that WHO Member State representativ es came together solely to discuss traditional medicine and to prepare an advocacy document. In the Beijing Declaration, they recognized the role of traditional medicine in the improvement of public health and supported its integration into national healt h systems where appropriate. The declaration encourages governments to create or improve national policies on traditional medicine. It also promotes improved education, research and clinical inquiry into traditional medicine, as well as improved communic ation between health care providers.62 In May, 2009, the World Health Assembly (WHA), the governing body of WHO, noted the adoption of the Beijing Declaration and urged Member States to implement its policies. The WHA further directed WHO to provide suppo rt to Member States in implementing the Beijing Declaration. EXCERPTS FROM THE BE IJING DECLARATION I. The knowledge of traditional medicine, treatments and practices should be respected, preserved, promoted and communicated widely and appropriately based on the circumstances in each country. II. Governments have a responsibility for the health of t heir people and should formulate national policies, regulations, and standards as part of comprehensive national health systems to ensure appropriate, safe and effective use of traditional medicine. III. Recognizing the progress of many governments to date in integrating traditional medicine into their national health systems, we call on those who have not yet done so to take action. IV. Traditional medicine should be further developed based on research and innovation in line with the \"Global strate gy and plan of action on public health, innovation and intellectual property\" adopted at the Sixty -first World Health Assembly in resolution WHA61.21 in 2008. Governments, international organizations and other stakeholders should collaborate in implementi ng the global strategy and plan of action. V. Governments should establish systems for the qualification, accreditation or licensing of traditional medicine practitioners. Traditional medicine practitioners should upgrade their knowledge and skills ba sed on national requirements. VI. The communication between conventional and traditional medicine providers should be strengthened and appropriate training programmes be established for health professionals, medical students and relevant researchers.63 62 Ryan Abbott, The Beijing Declaration \u2014A Milestone for Traditional Medicine, 13(1) ICTSD -Bridges March 2009. 63 The Beijing Declaration, Adopted by the WHO Congress on Traditional Medicine, (Nov. 8, 2008), available at http://www.who.int/medicines/areas/traditional/TRM_BeijingDeclarationEN.pdf. 14 2. NATIONAL POLICIES ON TRADITIONAL MEDIC INE WHO notes that one of the major challenges facing the appropriate use of TM is the lack of comprehensive national policies on TM. WHO stated that national policies on TM \"are needed in order to define the rol e of TM/CAM in national health care delivery systems and how it can contribute to health sector reform. They can also ensure that the necessary regulatory and legal mechanisms are in place for promoting and maintaining good practice, that access to TM/CAM is equitable, and that the authenticity, safety and efficacy of any therapies used are assured. Without such policies, TM/CAM is practiced without government oversight and without patient consumer protection.\"64 The number of countries developing TM poli cies is rising. According to the first WHO global survey on national policy and regulation of traditional medicine, only five Member States had a national policy on traditional medicine prior to 1990. By 2003, that figure had reached 45, while 51 countri es reported national policies pending. The same trend is seen with national laws and regulations regarding herbal medicine.65 The United States of America does not have a national policy specifically directed to TM/CAM, and there is no agency specifically responsible for TM. However, a number of governmental and non -governmental organizations affect TM practice. The National Center for Complementary and Alternative medicine (NCCAM) at the National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Serv ices is the agency most responsible for TM. NCCAM was established by an act of U.S. Congress in 1998 to explore CAM practices in the context of rigorous science, train CAM researchers, and disseminate information. For 2013, NCCAM's fiscal budget was 120. 7 million dollars .66 In the past decade it has funded more than 2,500 research projects resulting in more than 3,300 scientific articles in peer -reviewed journals.67 In China, the first modern national policy on TM was issued in 1949, the same year as the founding of the People's Republic of China.68 Traditional medicine has historically played a prominent role in the national health care system and remains well integrated with allopathic care. Both systems of medicine receive government support, and the Chinese Constitution was amended in 1982 to state that \"both modern medicine and traditional Chinese medicine must be developed.\"69 This was the first time that the promotion and development of traditional medicine had been included in a national constitut ion.70 3. CULTURAL POLICES AND HUMAN RIGHTS Because traditional medicines may form a vital part of individual or community identity, human rights issues are intimately bound with TMK. Historically, colonialism and cultural imperialism have marginalized traditional practitioners and medicine, and misappropriation of TMK has had disastrous effects on community livelihood and cultural identity. On the other hand, human rights violations have also been committed in the name 64 WHO TM Strategy, supra note 4, at 20. 65 WHO, National Policy on Traditional Medicine and Regulation of Herbal Medicines: Report of a WHO Global Survey, May 2005 at 12 . 66 http:/ /nccam.nih.gov/about/budget/appropriations.htm . 67 http://nccam.nih.gov/about/offices/od/directortestimony/0410.htm. 68 WHO, National Policy on Traditional Medicine and Regulation of Herbal Medicines: Report of a WHO Global Survey, May 2005 at 129. 69 H.

Principles of human rights should be applied to all a spects of traditional healing. In September 2007, the UN General Assembly adopted the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. This Declaration was the product of more than twenty years of discussion within the UN system, and ind igenous representatives played a key role in the development of this Declaration. Today, there are over 370 million indigenous people in 90 countries worldwide.71 EXCERPTS FROM THE UN ITED NATIONS DECLARA TION ON THE RIGHTS O F INDIGENOUS PEOPLES Article 24 1. Indigenous peoples have the right to their traditional medicines and to maintain their health practices, including the conservation of their vital medicinal plants, animals and minerals. Indigenous individuals also have the right to access, without a ny discrimination, to all social and health services. 2. Indigenous individuals have an equal right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. States shall take the necessary steps with a view to achieving progre ssively the full realization of this right. Article 31 1. Indigenous peoples have the right to maintain, control, protect and develop their cultural heritage, traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions, as well as the manifestations of their sciences, technologies and cultures, including human and genetic resources, seeds, medicines, knowledge of the properties of fauna and flora, oral traditions, literatures, designs, sports and traditional games and visual and performing arts. They also have the right to maintain, control, protect and develo p their intellectual property over such cultural heritage, traditional knowledge, and traditional cultural expressions. 2. In conjunction with indigenous peoples, States shall take effective measures to recognize and protect the exercise of these rights .72 71 United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues [UNFPII], About UNFPII and a Brief History of Indigenous Peoples and the International System, http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/en/history.html. 72 United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenou s Peoples.

REGULATION OF TRADIT IONAL MEDICINE National regulatory systems on traditional medicine vary considerably worldwide. These range from an absence of regulation to highly structured regulation similar to that applied to pharmaceuticals. WHO notes that an appropriate legal and regulatory infrastructure for TM is vital in \"promoting and maintaining good practice; assuring authenticity, safety and efficacy of traditional and complementary/alternative therapies; and providing equitable access to health care resources and information about those resources.\"73 1. DATA EXCLUSIVITY In many nations, regulatory approval of a new pharmaceutical drug requires the submission of comprehensive information on the medicine's safety and efficacy.74 There is ongoing debate whether marketing exclusivity should be granted in return for data submission.75 Data -based exclusivity prevents generic drug manufacturers from making use of data submitted in an initial application by an originator pharmaceutical manufacturer for a fixed period of time.76 In effect, this may extend the exclusivity period for an originator drug beyond the patent term or beyond a finding that a patent is invalid.77 In applying for regulatory approval of a generic equivalent to an approved on -patent medicine, access to or reliance on the original application for regulatory approval is essential. While generics manufacturers can independently generate new clinical data, this is extremely costly and time-consuming. Also, re -generating clinical test da ta may be regarded as unethical in that it exposes human subjects to a clinical trial that would add no scientific value, and provides a placebo to some patients in place of a medicine with proven efficacy. If TMK holders are required to submit informat ion to regulatory agencies for marketing approval of traditional medicines, they should be aware of whether that data will be kept confidential. If data submitted to a regulatory agency for marketing approval is made public, this may result in the loss of certain IP protections. 2. REGULATION IN THE UNITED STATES OF AME RICA In the United States of America , the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is the government agency primarily responsible for regulating foods and medicines. It is also responsible f or regulating dietary supplements, such as herbal medicines, under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) of 1994.78 The Act specifies that supplements are to be regulated as foods, rather than drugs or food additives, and this limits the FDA's premarket regulatory authority.79 Unlike 73 WHO, Legal Status of Traditional Medicine and Complementary/Alternative Medicine: A WHO Worldwide Report, (WHO 2001) at Page ix. 74 Ryan Abbott, Big Data and Pharmacovigilance: Using Health Information Exchanges to Revolutionize Drug Safety. 99 Iowa L. Rev. 225 (2013). Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2246217. 75 TRIPS does not discuss \"exclusivity\" of test data for patent applications; it states that Members should protect such data against \"disclosure\" and \"unfair co mmercial use \". It is up to national authorities to determine how data protection should occur. 76 See Ryan Abbott, Overcoming Barriers to a Global Trea ty on Medical Funding and R&D, 7 Revista Eletr\u00f4nica do IBPI (2012 ) (Braz.). 77 Ryan Abbott et al., Impact of Strong Intellectual Property Protection on Access to Medicines in Jordan, Medicines Transparency Alliance, 9 Journal of Generic Medicines 75 (2012). 78 The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, Pub. L. No. 103 -417. 79 DSHEA defines dietary supplements as: a product (other than tobacco) intended to supplement the diet that bears or contains one or more of the following dietary ingredients: a vitamin; a mineral; an herb or other botanical; an amino acid; a 17 pharmaceuticals, dietary supplements can be produced, sold and marketed without evidence of safety or efficacy. Under DSHEA, it is the FDA's responsibility to prove a dietary supplement is unsafe before it c an be removed from the market. To withdraw a product, the FDA must prove that the product places consumers at \"significant or unreasonable risk\" . Dietary supplement labels may only make health claims, nutrient content claims, and structure/function claims.80 Health claims describe a relationship between a dietary supplement ingredient and reduced risk of a disease condition, nutrient content claims describe the relative amount of a dietary substance in a product, and structure/function claims describ e how supplements may affect the organs or systems of the body without mention of any specific disease. In practice, structure/function claims may promise vaguely worded health benefits that can be similar to claims to treat illness. Examples include \"calcium builds strong bones\" and \"fiber maintains bowel regularity\" . FDA approval is not required for structure/function claims, but manufacturers must provide the FDA with the text of the claim within 30 days of product marketing.81 Claims must be followed by the disclosure that \"This statement has not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease.\"82 In addition, DSHEA requires manufacturers to have substantiation that clai ms are truthful and not misleading, although they are not required to provide such substantiation to the FDA and DSHEA does not provide a required standard of evidence.83 Manufacturers that want to legally make a claim to treat illness may only do so if th eir claims are supported by adequate scientific evidence. Pre -authorization is required by the FDA prior to making claims to treat illness.84 DSHEA did not originally require that manufacturers report adverse effects to the FDA. However, since 2006 dieta ry supplement manufacturers have been required to report any \"serious\" adverse effects within 15 days of knowledge of the event.85 DSHEA also did not provide GMPs for dietary supplement production, and as a result manufacturers were only responsible for making a good faith effort to ensure products contain pure substances that were not contaminated, weakened or mislabeled.86 The FDA proposed rules for GMPs in 2003 ,87 however , no rules were adopted until 2007.88 These rules set requirements for domestically marketed herbs that include meeting specifications for identity, purity, strength, and composition.89 dietary substa nce for use to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake; or a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of any ingredient described above.

This botanical drug was supported by extensive clinical res earch and was approved in the standard new drug application (NDA) used for pharmaceutical candidates. Although a botanical preparation, this medicine is now approved as a pharmaceutical medicine and prescribed by physicians. In 2012, the FDA approved a second botanical prescription drug: Fulyzaq (crofelemer).90 Fulyzaq is indicated to relieve symptoms of diarrhea in HIV/AIDS patients taking medicines to treat HIV infection. It is the first FDA -approved treatment for HIV - associated diarrhea. Fulyzaq is derived from the red sap of the Croton lechleri plant, which is a traditional herbal medicine known as sangre de grado (\"dragon's blood\"). It is used extensively within the indigenous cultures of the Amazon River to treat diarrhea, among other conditions .91 3. REGULATION IN THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY In the European Union (EU), two general pathways exist for authorizing medicinal products: a centralized and a mutual recognition procedure. Under the centralized procedure, companies submit a single marketing authorization application to the European Medicines Agency (EMA), which is the agency that coordinates the evaluation and supervision of medicinal products throughout the EU.92 The application is then considered by the EMA and, if applicable, a p ositive opinion is adopted which permits a single market authorization valid for the whole of the EU. Under the mutual recognition procedure, approval by a single national regulatory body is accepted by other countries.93 Marketing authorization applicati ons for herbal medicines must fall within one of three categories: 1) full dossier with product -specific safety and efficacy data, 2) well -established use with sufficient safety and efficacy data, or 3) traditional use with sufficient safety data and plaus ible efficacy (simplified registration procedure).94 Because product -specific safety and efficacy data is rarely available, most herbal medicines are approved for well - established or traditional use. To apply for approval under well -established use, the active substances of an herbal medicine must have been in use within the EU for at least 10 years, with recognized efficacy and an acceptable level of safety. A bibliographic application is permitted, which must provide a detailed scientific bibliography addressing non -clinical and clinical characteristics.95 This can include post marketing studies, epidemiological studies, appropriate monographs, 90 http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm333701.htm. 91 Miller, MJ et al., Treatment of gastric ulcers and diarrhea with the Amazonian herbal medicine sangre de grado, (2000), available at http://www.reparagen.com/PDF%2014.pdf . 92 European Medicines Agency, About us, http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/about_us/general/general_content_000235.jsp (last visited Sept. 29, 2013). 93 Mary Rice, For the European Medicines Agency, a Decade of Challenges, 97(19) J.

(L 311) p. 67 -128. 19 etc.96 The application must include a systematic review of literature, including recent searches of medical a nd toxicological databases, and all documentation, both favorable and unfavorable, must be discussed.97 If published literature does not meet minimum requirements, it can be combined with additional non -clinical tests as a mixed application.98 The category of traditional use was established in 2004 when the EMA released the Directive on Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products (DTHMP).99 The EMA designed this separate application procedure for traditional herbal medicines because scientific data on efficacy is often insufficient for standard approval. The requirement for proof of efficacy is replaced by a \"plausibility\" requirement. \"The rationale behind the actual simplified registration procedure is to enable products which have been in long standing tradit ional medicinal use to be registered according to a simplified procedure because their safety and efficacy can be deduced from their long standing use in the specified conditions of use.\"100 This allows consumers access to medicines that would not otherwise be approved, while at the same time controlling for quality and safety. For a supplement to qualify for this application there must be documentation that it has been used for a period of at least 30 years, including at least 15 years in the EU.101 Furth ermore, the supplement can only be marketed for minor conditions that do not require physician assistance, and must still fulfill other standard application requirements including evidence of GMPs and the submission of quality measures. Without this simpl ified procedure, most traditional herbal medicines would be unable to fulfill the well -established use requirement for detailed references to published scientific literature on product safety and efficacy. The EMA states that in the case of traditional he rbal medicines, \"the long tradition makes it possible to suppress the need for clinical data, in so far as the efficacy of the medicinal product is plausible on the basis of its long -standing use and experience as testified by bibliographic or expert evide nce.\"102 The requirement that a supplement must have been used for at least 15 years in the EU prevents the marketing of a large number of supplements from elsewhere in the world. Traditional medicines from China, India and Brazil, for example, may fail t o satisfy this condition. While there has been debate within the EU about eliminating this constraint, it remains part of the regulatory scheme. Other nations, such as China, have similar requirements for a history of domestic use, which may have a prote ctionist element. In other words, these regulations may promote the sale of local goods while preventing the sale of goods produced in other nations. 96 European Medicines Agency [EMA], Post -Authorisation Evaluation of Medicines for Human Use , EMEA/HMPC/104613/2005 (2006), p. 5, available at http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Scientific_guideline/2009/09/WC500003644.pdf. 97 Id. at 5. 98 European Medicines Agency [EMA], Post -Authorisation Evaluation of Medicines for Human Use, EMEA/HMPC/32116/2005 (2006), p. 3, available at http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Scientific_guideline/2009/09/WC500003576.pdf. 99 Specific Directive (2004/24/EC) amending, as regards traditional herbal medicinal products, Directive 2001/83 /EC on the community code relating to medicinal products for human use, 2004 O.J.

REGULATION IN CHI NA The most important agencies in China for the regulation of traditional medicine are the State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) and the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine (SATCM). The SFDA and SATCM both formulate regulations and good practices relevant to TCM and supervise implementation.103 National legi slation specifically for TCM, Regulations on TCM, has been in force since 2003. However, these regulations primarily serve to promote TCM and do not establish criteria for safety or efficacy.104 The result is that the most important regulations for TCM are issued by state agencies and local governments. Generally, traditional Chinese medicines are regulated as drugs and must adhere to many of the regulations for pharmaceutical medicines. Manufacturers require a good manufacturing practices (GMP) certifi cate and sellers require a good supply practices (GSP) certificate. This applies to all Chinese herbal medicines regardless of their dosage form (oral tablet, injection, etc.). Only traditional medicines registered as drugs are permitted to make therapeu tic claims. For a traditional Chinese medicine to be marketed as a drug it must first be approved by the SFDA. A Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China contains a list of the TCM preparations that have already been approved. Without preexisti ng approval, the new approval process is extensive and similar to the approval process of pharmaceuticals. Approval requires submission of pre -clinical and clinical study data, and approved medicines are then subject to up to five years of additional post -market surveillance. In addition, these traditional Chinese medicines face a number of TCM -specific regulations. For example, traditional medicines are also required to adhere to information in the pharmacopoeia and in relevant monographs.105 Since 2008, enterprises involved in processing prepared slices of Chinese herbal medicines have been required to comply with GMP requirements.106 If herbal products are used as ingredients in food and do not make specific health claims, then there is no registration r equirement as a drug.107 These products are then governed by general food regulations. Traditional medicines in food which claim health effects (these are general health claims, but not specific therapeutic claims) undergo special regulation as health food s.108 Health foods must have raw materials and final products that comply with food hygiene requirements and that do not cause human harm, animal or human studies to demonstrate a health effect, and a formulation and dosage based on scientific evidence.109 Traditional medicines that would qualify as health foods, but that are not indigenous to China, have separate regulations as novel health foods. 103 State Food and Drug Administration, P.R.

REGULATION IN IND IA Traditional medicines may be regulated as prescription drugs, over -the-counter medic ines or dietary supplements and marketed with medical, health or nutrient content claims respectively. Modern regulations on traditional medicine began with the Drugs and Cosmetics Act of 1940, which contained a separate chapter and rules for Ayurveda, Si ddha and Unani drugs.110 The Act, amended in 2000, requires government licensing of manufacturers and sellers of traditional medicines. It contains regulations for misbranded and adulterated drugs, prohibits the manufacture and sale of certain drugs, and stipulates penalties fo r regulatory violations. The central government is also empowered to inspect and analyze traditional medicines. Manufacturers of traditional medicines are now required to adhere to good manufacturing practices, as well as requirements related to factor y premises and heavy metal contents. Heavy metals are sometimes considered active ingredients of traditional Indian medicines rather than contaminants, but heavy metal testing is now mandatory. In addition, heavy metals may not be present above permissib le limits, and labeling must note the presence of heavy metals.111 Traditional medicine manufacturers are also required to adhere to information contained in national pharmacopoeias and monographs. Safety requirements for traditional medicines are less str ict than those applied to pharmaceuticals, and there is generally no submission requirement for clinical trials demonstrating safety and efficacy.112 The Department of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy (AYUSH) is primarily respons ible for the regulation of traditional medicines.113 6. REGULATION IN BRA ZIL National traditional medicine guidelines have existed in Brazil since 1967, and were most recently updated in 2004.114 These guidelines establish the core components of traditiona l medicine regulation such as proper botanical identification of medicines, basic quality standards and the need to ensure safety and efficacy. In addition, several complementary guidelines named Resolu\u00e7\u00f5es Espec\u00edficas contain additional regulations and relevant information. The principal authority for regulation of traditional medicine is the Ag\u00eancia Nacional de Vigil\u00e2ncia Sanit\u00e1ria (ANVISA). Under these regulations, traditional medicines can be regulated as prescription and over-the-counter drugs, functional foods, probiotics, bioactive substances and cosmetics. Medical claims are only permitted for traditional medicines registered as herbal drugs. For a traditional medicine to be approved as an herbal drug it must contain only herbal ingredients and it must meet similar quality, safety and efficacy criteria as required for pharmaceuticals. Only manufacturers with ANVISA Good Manufacturing Practices and Control certification may register herbal medicines.115 More than 600 herbal medicines have been registered from around 150 medicinal plant species, only 16% of which are of South American origin.116 110 Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Central Drug Standards Control Organization, Laws Pertaining to Manufacture and Sale of Drugs in India, http://cdsco.nic.in/html/law.htm.

For chemical entities based on plant compounds, documentation of efficacy, safety and quality measures are required for registration, which may include clini cal trials. Existing scientific documentation may be submitted, instead of newly performed clinical trials or animal tests, if such documentation already exists for the proposed preparation. Pharmaceutical requirements for data on safety and efficacy are waived in the case of herbal medicines with documented safe traditional use. A post marketing surveillance system for traditional medicines was established in 2001. Producers may prefer to register traditional medicines as foods or cosmetics because quality and safety requirements are simpler. Traditional medicines registered as foods cannot present therapeutic claims, but can be registered in a special food category with the ability to make functional or health claims. Claims should be supported by strong scientific evidence, and references to curing or preventing disease are not permitted.117 Traditional medicines that have not been traditionally used in Brazil are classified as new foods, and require strong scientific evidence to make functional or health claims. Dried plants with pharmacological effects used to make tea have separate registration procedures. Like foods, traditional medicines registered as cosmetics are not permitted to make therapeutic claims. These products must be for externa l personal use, and have no specific regulations beyond those that generally apply to cosmetics. Finally, some traditional medicines can also be registered as \"dinamizados\" (homeopathic, anthroposophical and antihomotoxic medicines).118 These are medicines used in homeopathic medicine, and may or may not have exclusively plant based ingredients. 7. TRADITIONAL SYSTE MS OF REGULATION Customary laws and practices may govern how TMK is developed and transmitted in local communities.119 For example, TMK may be passed down only among family members or specific individuals within a healing tradition. Exclusive rights and monopoly powers over TMK are not uncommon within traditional communities.120 Alternately, TMK may be considered communal property of an indigenous group. Traditional systems of regulation may place restrictions on how TMK can be used or disseminated. In North American societies, traditional Native American healers possess the ability to make \"medicine bundles\" . These contain a variety of materials such as animal skins and talismans that are important for communal and personal activities.121 Medicine bundles were used in war and religious ceremonies. The transfer of these bund les is accompanied by TMK and the right to practice as a healer.122 In Native American communities, transferring ownership of physical bundles is analogous to transfer of modern IPRs. 117 Id. 118 B.

Press (2005). 122 WIPO FFM , supra note 119 at 63. 23 V. INTELLECTUAL PROP ERTY AND TRADITIONAL MEDICINE Modern notions o f IP may conflict with traditional systems of knowledge ownership.123 Indigenous cultures have not historically made the same sorts of property/non -property distinctions supported by current law; however, traditional restrictions on the possession and use o f knowledge are common.124 Social restrictions may govern who, if anyone, can use certain knowledge, and under what conditions. Knowledge may be considered secret or sacred, and making it publicly available would disregard traditional cultural prohibitions . Alternately, some knowledge may be held collectively by a community or considered an integral part of the natural environment. When modern concepts of ownership are applied to traditional medicine, TMK holders may feel their rights are being violated. 1. INTELLECTUAL PROPERT Y RIGHTS IPRs convey legal ownership over certain intangible assets, such as artistic works, commercial designs, and pharmaceutical technologies.125 Common types of IP include patents, trademarks, copyrights, geographical indications, p rotection for plant varieties and trade secrets. IPRs generally provide creators of original works economic incentives to develop and share ideas through a form of temporary monopoly. IPRs are granted nationally, and most countries provide IP protectio n. Minimum standards for domestic laws are established by a complex framework of international treaties and agreements, including by the Agreement on Trade -Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS).126 TRIPS is a treaty adopted within the fra mework of the World Trade Organization (WTO).127 One of the most important types of IPR for medicines is patent protection. A patent grants a set of exclusive rights to an inventor for a limited time that prevents others from commercially using the patente d invention without permission. Patents allow their right holders to prevent third parties from making, using, selling, offering for sale or importing for these purposes a patented invention. In return, an inventor must submit a patent application to the national government which discloses how to replicate the invention by a person skilled in the art. Furthermore, inventions must generally be new, inventive and industrially applicable. Once a patent is expired, third parties may use the claimed inventio n without the consent of the patent owner. Examples of patents based on TMK include U.S. patents based on maca , a traditional Peruvian food and medicine first cultivated by the Incas.128 123 TRIPS , CBD and Traditional Medicines: Concepts and Questions. 2001. http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Jh2996e/1.html. 124 WIPO, Intergovernmental Committee on Intellectual Property and Genetic Resources, Traditional Knowledge and Folklore, Seventeenth Session, Note on the Meanings of the term \"Public Domain\" in the Inte llectual Property System with special reference to the Protection of Traditional Knowledge and Traditional Cultural Expressions/Expressions of Folklore, WIPO/GRTFK/IC/17/INF/8 (Nov. 24, 2010). 125 This text is only intended to provide an overview of intellec tual property rights.

WTO provides a forum for Member States to negotiate and sign trade agreements in order to help producers of goods and services, exporters, and importers conduct their business. See generally www.wto.int. 128 WIPO, Intergovernmental Committee on Intellectual Property and Genetic Resources, Traditional Knowledge and Folklore, Fifth Session, WIPO/GRTKF/IC/5/13 (May 12, 2003), available at http://www.wipo.int/edocs/mdocs/tk/en/wipo_grtkf_ic_5/wipo_grtkf_ic_5_13.pdf. 24 Other forms of IPRs also have a role in the protection of TMK. Trademarks protect words, phrases, symbols and designs that identify a source of goods. This helps consumers identify products with preferred characteristics, such as a specific brand of herb al medicine. Trademarks have been used to market products that are based on TMK, such as Truong Son Balsam , a traditional balm of medicinal plants from Vietnam.129 However, while trademarks can help distinguish authentic goods, they do not prohibit third p arties from using traditional knowledge. Trademark rights are established either through registration or use in commerce. A collective trademark is a trademark owned by an organization whose members use the mark to identify themselves with a certain char acteristic. Whereas trademarks are intended to indicate an individual source of goods or services, collective marks are intended for group use. Copyright is granted to creators of original works against unauthorized use by third parties. Protectable s ubject matter is broad and includes books, films, music recordings and computer software, but not functional works or ideas. Protection generally lasts for the creator's lifetime plus at least 50 years. \"HOT YOGA\" CONTROVER SY Bikram Yoga is a 90 -minu te sequence of 26 traditional yoga postures and two breathing exercises performed in 105 -degree heat.130 It was developed by Bikram Choudhury, who received copyright protection for his yoga sequence in 1978 and trademark protection in 2002. It has since be come popular worldwide, with about 900 franchise studios marketing Bikram Yoga classes. IP protection for Bikram Yoga has resulted in very significant financial benefits for its founder.131 Bikram Yoga has also become a focus of criticism from the Indian media, government officials and yoga experts.132 The Indian government is now filming hundreds of yoga poses to help challenge current, and prevent future, IP protection for Bikram Yoga, as well as hundreds of other yoga -related copyrights, trademarks and patents.133 A geographical indication (GI) is another sort of IPR that helps identify a source of goods. Geographical indications associate a product with a place based on a characteristic associated with the product's place of origin. The classic example of a GI is \"Champagne,\" which refers to sparkling wine produced in a specific region of France. GIs could be used to distinguish TMK based products by location, but cannot protect against the same use of TMK not associated with a place. GIs have been used in the Russian Federation to protect traditional craft making industries.134 The way in which GIs are protected varies by nation, and may require registration or use in commerce. New p lant varieties may be protected by more than one form of IPR, such as by patent or under a sui generis135 registration system. Protection applies to new varieties of plants that have been invented with human involvement. Patent protection for plant varieti es requires novelty, which may fail to protect plant varieties that have been cultivated over 129 WIPO, Intergovernmental Comm ittee on Intellectual Property and Genetic Resources, Traditional Knowledge and Folklore, Fourth Session, WIPO/GRTKF/IC/4/7 (Nov. 5, 2002) at Annex II, page 8. 130 See generally http://www.bikramyoga.com/. 131 Maureen Farrell, Bikram Yoga's New Twists, Forbes Magazine , Sept. 21, 2009, available at http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2009/0921/entrepreneurs -franchising -bikram -yoga -new-twists.html. 132 Jeremy Page, American Attempt to Patent Yoga puts Indians in a Twist, The Sunday Times , May 31, 2007, Patent Hundreds of Yoga Postures, The Telegraph , June 8, 2010, -postures.html. 134 WIPO/GRTKF/IC/4/7, supra Annex II, pa ge 8. 135 Sui generis regimes are described later in this section. 25 many generations. However, slight modifications to existing traditionally used plants may qualify. IP holders may also elect not to disclose information about an invention, and to protect their invention through secrecy. A trade secret is information not generally known or reasonably discoverable, through which an IP holder can obtain some economic advantage. Trade secrets must be the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain secrecy; once trade secrets become known they generally cease to enjoy protection. 2. OBSTACLES TO PROT ECTING TRADITIONAL M EDICINE Current IP regimes were not designed to accommodate traditional knowledge, and many experts have claimed that conventional patent laws are inadequate to protect TK and biodiversity.136 Patent protection is limited in duration, and that may be problematic for TMK that TMK holders believe should be protected retroactively and/or indefinitely.137 TMK holders are also presented with significant obstacles in attempting to obtain patents for TMK. The most significant challenge may be the requirement for novelty in any new invention. In the EU, if an invention becomes publicly available in any way before a patent application is filed, the application will be rejected.138 The U.S. has a similar requirement with a one -year grace period.139 Making the invention publicly available may include selling the invention, disseminating info rmation about the invention, or documenting the invention in a way that documentation can be accessed by a third party. Because many traditional medicines have been used for generations, disseminated in local communities, and documented in publicly availa ble sources, these medicines may fail to qualify for patent protection. The U.S . patent for turmeric was invalidated when evidence was provided that a traditional use had previously been documented in an ancient Sanskrit text as well as other sources. The requirement for inventiveness is also a significant barrier to patenting traditional medicines. Pharmaceutical drugs derived from natural products involve some form of alteration or purification, and such compounds may be considered a novel and invent ive step over naturally occurring substances. Because herbal medicines typically comprise natural products in their raw form, it may be difficult to claim that these remedies are novel and involve an inventive step (or, in U.S. terminology, are non -obviou s). It can also be problematic with TM to differentiate between prior art140 and a claimed invention, and ascertaining that difference is a prerequisite for assessing inventive step.141 In addition, patent applications require the identification of inventors , and determining inventorship of TMK may be difficult.142 136 WIPO, Intergovernmental Committee on Intellectual Property and Genetic Resources, Traditional Knowledge and Folklore, Third Session, WIPO/GRTKF/IC/3/7 (May 6, 2002) at 39. 137 See Ryan Abbot t, Treating the Health Care Crisis: Complementary and Alternative Medicine for PPACA, 14 DePaul J. Health Care L. 35 (2011). 138 European Patent Convention, Oct. 5, 1973, Article 54. 139 The one year grace period afforded by U.S. patent law allows an inventor to file a patent application within one year after public disclosure of an invention or first sale of a patented product. 35 U.S. Code Section 102 (2011). The recently enacted Leahy -Smith \"America Invents Act\" (AIA), which represents the most significant change to the U.S. patent system since the U.S. Patent Act of 1952, retains the uniquely American grace period but redefines what \"disclosures\" an inventor ca n make. Section 102(b)(1) . Leahy 112th Cong, \u00a7 1 -37 (2011). 140 Prior art is, in general, all the knowledge that existed prior to the relevant filing or priority date of a patent applicatio n, whether it existed by way of written and ora l disclosure. In some legal instruments there is a differentiation between printed publications, oral disclosures and prior use and where the publications or disclosure occurred.

Applying for a patent is a complicated process, requiring technical expertise an d the services of trained legal professionals. The cost of applying for a patent can be prohibitive for TK holders. 3. EVOLUTION OF INTE LLECTUAL PROPERTY PR OTECTION The issue of TM and IPRs has become a more prominent topic of debate in recent years. Developing countries, concerned about misappropriation of natural resources and preservation of biodiversity, are pushing for greater protection of TMK. IP protection for TM remains controversial, and discussions as well as negotiations are still ongoing at WIPO, within the framework of the Intergovernmental Committee on Intellectual Property and Genetic Resources, Traditional Knowledge and Folklore (the IGC)143, and WTO. The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) is an international treaty adop ted in 1992 to promote conservation of biological diversity, sustainable use of natural resources, and fair and equitable benefit -sharing arising from use of GRs.144 It recognizes that States have the sovereign right to exploit their own resources and to co ntrol access to GRs.145 Article 8(j) is directly relevant to TM. It states that a contracting party to the Convention shall, as far as possible and as appropriate, \"subject to its national legislation, respect, preserve and maintain knowledge, innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity and promote their wider application with the approval and involvement of the holders of such knowle dge, innovations and practices and encourage the equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of such knowledge, innovations and practices.\"146 Currently, 193 nations are parties to the CBD.147 A supplementary agreement to the CBD was adopt ed in October 2010, the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization to the Convention on Biological Diversity (Nagoya Protocol) .148 It provides a legal framework for access and benefit -sharing (ABS) arising from the utilization of GRs and associated traditional knowledge.149 The Protocol establishes more detailed rules regarding the mechanisms for providing information to national patent offices and other stakeholders, and for sh aring benefits on mutually agreed terms. The Protocol has not yet entered into force. However, the CBD and Nagoya Protocol still require strong national policies and legislation to truly support the rights of TMK holders. In the absence of a strong in ternational framework for TMK protection, regional and domestic efforts have been made to protect TM. National laws are currently the prime mechanism for achieving protection and practical benefits for TMK holders. China, which has substantial interes ts in the protection of its TM and biodiversity resources for commercial exploitation, has enacted pro -TM patent laws. China is one of the largest TMK -holding countries of the world, and its patent law, enacted in 1993, is the oldest 143 See http://www.wipo.int/tk/en/i gc/. 144 Convention on Biological Diversity [CBD], Text of the Convention on Biological Diversity, http://www.cbd.int/convention/convention.shtml. 145 Id. at Art. 3 and 15. 146 Convention on Biological Diversity, supra note 14 4, at Art. 8(j). 147 CBD, List of Par ties, http://www.cbd.int/convention/parties/list/. 148 CBD, Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity, Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization to the Convention on Biological Diversity, (Montreal 2011), http://www.cbd.int/abs/doc/protocol/nagoya -protocol -en.pdf. 149 CBD, About the Protocol, http://www.cbd.int/abs/about/. 27 patent regime for TMK protection.150 Chinese patent law protects new TM products, methods of process, and uses of TM. This includes herbal preparations, extracts from herbal medicines, foods containing herbal medicines, methods for preparing herbal formulas and new medical indications for traditional formulas.151 By 2002, the Chinese State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO) had received 20,864 patent applications related to TCM.152 These applications are managed by a group of more than 30 TCM -specialist patent examiners. China has also re quired the disclosure of the source of GRs in domestic patent applications. This is an attempt to both shield its large domestic market and to promote exports of biological resource based inventions to foreign markets. China has joined a group of develop ing countries with diverse biological resources including Brazil and India in negotiating at WIPO and WTO to require mandatory disclosure of the source and origin of GRs and/or associated TK, and to provide evidence of compliance with applicable national prior informed consent and equitable benefit -sharing requirements.153 4. SUI GENERIS REGIMES In the context of IP, sui generis laws refer to a unique set of protections for a particular subject matter.154 For example, TRIPS requires that nations provide IP protection for plant varieties, but permits nations to either provide patent protection or sui generis protection. The African Union, a regional organization, has developed a model law that protects both plant varieties and TK.155 The objectives of this le gislation include ensuring the sustainable use of biological resources, benefit -sharing and the protection of traditional knowledge. Indigenous peoples and local communities have the right to refuse third parties access to TK when they determine that shar ing access may threaten the integrity of their cultural heritage.156 Several nations have taken the initiative in providing specialized protection for TM in IP systems. Peru, for example, established a sui generis regime to promote respect for, and protect ion of, the collective knowledge of indigenous people.157 The objectives of the law include promoting the fair and equitable distribution of benefits, ensuring the use of TK takes place with the prior informed consent of indigenous peoples, and preventing misappropriation. 150 Xuan Li and Weiwei Li, Inadequacy of Patent Regime on Traditional Medicinal Knowledge \u2014A Diagn osis of 13 -Year Traditional Medicinal Knowledge Patent Experience in China, 10(2) J.

THE PUBLIC DOMAIN The public domain is generally thought to consist of knowledge, ideas and innovations over which no one has any proprietary rights, and which are, therefore, freely available to be used or exploited.158 Information in the public domain is often considered in negative terms, as whatever is left over after various tests of legal protection have been applied.159 Inventions, for example, may enter the public domain if the subject matter is ineligible for pro tection,160 or if prior IPRs have expired.161 This common understanding of the public domain ignores some critical distinctions. Being publicly available is not the same as being in the public domain. For example, use of publicly available traditional medic ine may still require prior informed consent from TMK holders as well as benefit -sharing. Also, information in the public domain may not be publicly available. For instance, access to unpublished texts may be physically restricted, and this may convey mo re control over use than IP laws provide.162 Certain uses of materials covered by IPRs may also be permitted under exceptions authorized by international IP rules, such as fair uses of copyrighted material. In addition, IPR protected material may be made a vailable under licenses that permit wide use (e.g., Creative Commons [CC]). In regards to TMK, the role of the \"public domain\" is controversial. It has been criticized by TMK holders as operating to exclude traditional medicine from protection and to justify misappropriation.163 On the other hand, the public domain can be thought of in positive terms as a valuable resource.164 Information in the public domain serves as the foundation for the creation of new knowledge, and as a rich source of content for education.165 A substantial amount of TMK is already publicly available. TCM, for example, is taught extensively outside of China in both Europe and the United States of America, and both traditional and modern sources of information on Chinese herbal ther apeutics are freely available in a variety of languages. TMK holders have the option of voluntarily disseminating knowledge without IP protection. The Government of China has made the strategic decision to disseminate some knowledge and promote codifie d166 TCM worldwide. China may hope that increased use of TCM will still produce economic benefit in the absence of formal IPRs.167 The Government of India, on the other hand, has chosen to restrict information it is documenting on Ayurveda. 158 See WIPO, Standing Committee on the Law of Patents, Dissemination of Patent Information, Thirteenth Session, SCP/13/5, Feb. 18, 2009, at para. 110. 159 E.

For example, the different tra ditions of Indian medicine such as Ayurveda, Siddha, and Unani Tibb are documented in at least 54, 29, and 13 authoritative books respectively. See: WIPO FFM, supra note 119, at 59. 167 A significant portion of TCM may remain non -codified (not -recorded). Th is is particularly true of practical applications of TCM theory and TMK developed by ethnic minorities outside of mainstream TCM. Xuan Li and Weiwei Li, supra note 14 1. 29 India may later decide to release TMK under IP protection, or may use TMK to develop new technologies and therapeutics. TMK holders may have non -economic motivations for disseminating information as well. Social and environmental pressures currently threaten the pres ervation of some forms of TMK, and concerns that knowledge may be lost may prompt holders to disseminate information. Some holders may choose to release information for altruistic purposes, as TMK may improve health care outside of indigenous communities. If TMK has already been made publicly available, TK holders may no longer have the option of applying for certain IP protections.168 KAVA Kava is a medical plant first domesticated in the Republic of Vanuatu, an island nation located in the South Pacific Ocean, and it is used as a traditional medicine in several Asian countries. Today, many large pharmaceutical companies make kava based products, and genetic elements of the kava plant have been patented in Europe.169 The U.S. Patent office has gran ted a U.S. based company a patent for \"kavatrol,\" a dietary supplement that serves as a general relaxant, composed of Kava, chamomile, hops, and schizandra.170 Two German companies have obtained a patent for Kava as a prescription drug for treating strokes, insomnia and Alzeimer's disease. A cosmetics company has patented the use of Kava against hair loss in France.171 6. OWNERSHIP OF INTE LLECTUAL PROPERTY RI GHTS The IP system has been criticized for not adequately taking into account collective ownership of traditional knowledge.172 The modern concept of property rights belonging to one or more identifiable individuals may be poorly suited to capture the shared development of ideas within an indigenous community. Some national sui generis regimes provide special rules for collective ownership of traditional knowledge. For example, Brazil permits traditional knowledge associated with GRs to be owned by an indigenous community, even if only one member of that community holds the knowledge.173 On the other hand, a number of countries stipulate that IPRs associated with TK are the sole property of a government agency.174 Although indigenous communities possess the knowledge, in these countries they are not directly entitled to IP protection. Within conventional frameworks there are still ways in which TMK holders can attempt to control IPRs collectively. This can be accomplished through individual ownership 168 Some sui generis regimes may still provide some method for compensation. For example, Peruvian legislation requires that an unspecified percentage of the income derived from products related to TK that has passed into the public domain withi n the past 20 years be contributed to the National Fund for Indigenous Peoples.

In the legal sense, an \"entity\" or \"person\" does not need to be an individual; it can be a business organization, for example, a corporation, limited liability company, or partnership. Even a national government can be treated as a \"person\" for purposes of ownership. Indig enous group members can jointly control IP through ownership or control of a business entity. Community members may also collectively control IPRs through licensing. Licensing permits an IPR owner to authorize one or more licensees to use protected sub ject matter. Contracts can be structured to permit a variable degree of use by licensees, and non - licensed third -parties must still observe the IPR. Licensing could permit members of an indigenous community to use the subject matter, or could allow the T MK to be marketed outside of the community without sharing direct ownership of an IPR. Finally, multiple individuals can directly share joint ownership of IPRs. The rights and requirements of joint ownership vary by form of IP and also by country. Collective trademarks and geographical indications are intended for group use. Collective marks are owned by one entity, but they may be used and enforced by multiple individuals. Geographical indications allow a group to identify a good as originating in a territory, region or locality, where a given characteristic of the good is essentially attributable to its geographical origin. For patents and copyrights, multiple individuals usually share joint undivided interests in the subject matter. It is more di fficult, though sometimes possible, to have joint ownership of trade secrets and trademarks. Because trademarks, for example, are designed to designate origin from an enterprise, joint ownership is only possible where joint owners are structured to assure joint control over the goods or services sold under the mark. TMK holders may wish to modify default rules of joint ownership by contractual agreements, although national laws may limit what contracts can stipulate. MIJIKENDA OWNERSHIP OF TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE The Mijikenda tribe consists of nine closely related sub -tribes located along the coast of Kenya.175 Clans consist of several family groups with a common patriarchal ancestor. Each clan has its own sacred place known as a kaya , a shrine for prayer, sacrifices and other religious rituals, located deep in the surrounding forests. TMK is restricted to clan or family members, and access brings a responsibility to ensure proper use for the benefit of community healthcare. A rating process is traditionally used to assess the personal conduct and motive of an applicant for TMK. The Mijikenda have not generally transmitted traditional knowledge to foreigners or non-villagers, although a council of elders may grant consent in specia l circumstances.176 TMK is protected through the belief that it will only be effective if used with proper rituals and initiations, and that non -compliance will be severely punished by spiritual powers. However, such beliefs may not be shared by third part ies, leaving communities vulnerable to misappropriation. Recently, there has been criticism that customary Mijikenda laws have been modified or completely lost.177 Loss of traditional territories due to commercial use and conservation efforts, growing in tegration with western society, and the extension of the government have been criticized for undermining time -honored authorities and values. As clans become westernized, a number of traditional healers have begun practicing commercially.178 175 See generally The Mijikenda Tribe, The Nine Information and Views for the CBD Expert Group on Traditional Knowledge Associated with Genetic Resources, Hyderabad 16 -19 June 2009, http://pubs.iied.org/pdfs/G02495.pdf, at 8. 177 Id. at 4. 178 Id. 31 Whereas Mijike nda healers traditionally charged small token fees, ensuring benefits for the whole community, some now charge high fees for herbal treatment which local patients may be unable to afford. Traditional community authorities have also been circumvented for access to TMK, either through direct contact with individual TMK holders or the government. In one case, permission to access a Mijikenda kaya for research purposes was granted by the local government authority without the tribal community's prior informed consent. Mass extraction of plants and biodiversity degradation allegedly ensued.179 179 Swiderska, supra note 17 6, at 17. 32 VI. CONSIDERATIONS F OR DOCUMENTING TRADI TIONAL MEDICINE TK holders are increasingly documenting TMK t o preserve, protect, and commercialize traditional medicine.180 However, the issues related to documenting TMK are complex, with potentially far reaching consequences. TMK holders should ensure they understand both the risks and benefits of documentation p rior to taking action. If TMK is documented, it is important that it be documented in the most appropriate manner. 1. BENEFITS AND RISK S OF DOCUMENTATION Documenting TMK may help preserve knowledge. Today, the cultural survival of many indigenous communities is threatened, and some traditional systems of disseminating knowledge may already be lost. Modern lifestyles and the disruption of traditional ways of life may cause younger generations to lose interest in learning about traditional medicine. Traditional languages used to pass down information may no longer be as widely understood. Documenting TMK may help preserve this knowledge for future generati ons. Documenting traditional medicinal knowledge may also improve the use of TM. Documentation can be a vital step in facilitating research on TM safety and efficacy. In addition, documentation may assist with clinical practice and teaching. Given th e important role traditional medicine plays in providing health care, documenting TMK may help improve public health. Documentation may also promote commercialization of TMK. Documentation is necessary to obtain certain types of IP protection, which ma y help TMK holders to market traditional medical based products and services. Documentation may also facilitate investment and innovations related to traditional medicine. TMK can be useful for bioprospecting, and may facilitate basic research on the hea ling properties of medicinal plants. For example, in South Africa, the Research Group for Traditional Medicines has established a database to improve research on TM.181 The Group aims to provide a scientific infrastructure for the use of TMK, improve commu nication between conventional and traditional practitioners, promote the use of TM and build human resources. Documenting TMK may also be useful for defensive protection of traditional medicine. Defensive protection prevents third parties from improperly obtaining IP rights over TMK. For example, the Indian government provided information to the European Patent Office to invalidate a patent granted on the ant i-fungal properties of Neem, a traditional Indian medicine. The Indian government presented documentation of the traditional use of Neem, and the patent was revoked in 2008. However, defensive protection does not prevent third parties from using TMK. In fact, providing information that TMK constitutes prior art can prevent TMK holders from obtaining some types of IP protection. The most prominent example of defensive protection has been the Traditional Knowledge Digital Library (TKDL) established by t he Indian government182; however, other 180 For additional information on documenting traditional knowledge more generally, see WIPO, The World Intellectual Property Organization Traditional Knowledge Documentation Toolkit, (Nov. 1, 2013), available at http://www.wipo.int/export/ sites/www/tk/en/resources/pdf/tk_toolkit_draft.pdf. The WIPO Traditional Knowledge Documentation Toolkit provides useful practical guidance on how to undertake a TK documentation exercise as a process and how to address critical IP related issues and quest ions, as they surface during this effort. 181 WIPO FFM, supra note 119. 182 European Patent Office [EPO], India's Traditional Knowledge Digital Library (TKDL): A powerful tool for patent examiners, (Jan. 25, 2010), http://www.tkdl.res.in/tkdl/TKDL_CSIR/pressrelease/press%20images/www.epo.org_topics_issues_traditional.html.pdf. 33 large -scale defensive projects exist. In 2008, the Chinese State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO) granted the European Patent Office access to its database on TCM. THE TRADITIONAL KNOW LEDGE DIGITAL LIBRAR Y (TKDL) This project is an initiative of several Indian government agencies designed to document traditional Indian Ayurvedic medicine.183 Information on Ayurveda may be publicly available in India, however it is difficult for patent examiners in other countries t o search prior art and determine if a claimed invention is novel. Traditional knowledge may be documented in languages such as Sanskrit that are not accessible to international patent examiners. The founding objective of the TKDL was to make documented i nformation easily and comprehensively accessible to patent examiners with the objective of preventing the granting of patents for traditional Indian medicines.184 The TKDL expert group estimated that internationally, about two thousand unjustifiable patents on Ayurveda were being granted annually.185 The TKDL makes digital information on Ayurveda available in multiple languages. Although the initial objective of the TKDL was to compile and widely disseminate information on Ayurveda, the Indian government m ore recently elected to restrict access to the database. In February, 2009, the TKDL became accessible to patent examiners at the European Patent Office (EPO) under an access agreement.186 This contract helps prevent the grant of patents where evidence of prior art exists in the TKDL, but information in the database is otherwise kept confidential. Access to the TKDL database was granted to the India Patent Office (CGPDTM) in July 2009, to the German Patent Office (DPMA) in October 2009, to the USPTO in Nov ember 2009, to the United Kingdom Patent and Trademark Office in February 2010, to the Canadian Intellectual Property Office in September 2010 and to IP Australia in January 2011.187 It is unclear at this point to what extent the Indian government may try t o exploit information in the TKDL commercially. Documenting TMK also has drawbacks. It may expose knowledge to third parties, and if TMK is freely available it may become part of the public domain. At this point, TMK holders generally cannot obtain trade secret or patent protection for TMK. In additi on, public disclosure may facilitate the unauthorized use of TK which TK holders wish to protect. TMK holders have limited control over TMK which is publicly available. While this information may have initially been released for altruistic purposes, th ird parties are able to commercialize TM in ways TMK holders may find objectionable. For example, a foreign manufacturer might choose to market a traditional herbal medicine for traditionally contraindicated symptoms. In addition to safety concerns, such marketing efforts may negatively affect the reputation of the traditional medicines or groups involved. 2. ADDITIONAL CONSID ERATIONS FOR DOCUMEN TATION Documenting traditional knowledge is complex, and potential challenges should be resolved prior to any documentation. Failure to address these issues in advance may result in loss of IP protection, misappropriation of resources, legal challenges to ownership and failure to adequately utilize TMK. 183 The TKDL also contains information on other forms of traditional medicine used in India, including Yoga, Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy. See generally http://www.tkdl.res.in/tkdl/langdefault/common/Abouttkdl.asp?GL=Eng. 184 K. Sharma, National me asures and experience for protection of traditional Indian medical knowledge of Ayurveda in the regime of intellectual property rights, WHO/EDM/TRM/2001.1, supra note 1 51. 185 Government of India Press Information Bureau, India Partners with EU to prevent I ndia's traditional medicinal knowledge from Biopiracy, Feb. 9. 2009, http://pib.nic.in/release/release.asp?relid=47343. 186 EPO, India's Traditional Knowledge Digital Library, supra note 18 2. 187 http://www.tkdl.res.in/tkdl/langdefault/common/Abouttkdl.asp?G L=Eng. 34 Complex questions of ownership surr ound many forms of TMK. In Zimbabwe, for example, TMK may be passed down along hereditary lines within a particular tribe or indigenous group. Who then \"owns\" this knowledge? Ownership claims may be brought by members of the healing community, members of the larger indigenous community or even the national government. It can be further challenging to identify who qualifies as a community member or \"practitioner trained in the art\" . Likewise, who should be authorized to represent a community? Should gro ups maintain traditional organization, or should modern notions of fair representation take precedence? There are no simple answers to questions of ownership, and ownership issues are likely to receive more attention as the financial value of TMK is incr easingly recognized. The WIPO Secretariat suggests that community consultations should be held in order to assess the views of community members.188 Community members may have differing opinions on whether TMK should be shared or commercialized, as well as how this should be accomplished. Ideally, consensus should be reached within a community. TMK holders should also have a clear idea of the goals and likely effects of documentation prior to taking any action. Is knowledge being documented defensively to prevent third parties from obtaining IP rights? Is knowledge being documented to assist researchers in finding new uses for traditional medicines or to develop new drugs from medicinal plants? Is knowledge being developed for widespread dissemination in order to promote and improve traditional medicine use? Understanding the goals of documentation is critical to ensuring a successful outcome. This will determine how knowledge should be documented, including whether knowledge should be kept confident ial. Community consensus is vital in setting the goals of documentation. Undertakings to document TMK should first focus on raising awareness within a community on why documenting may be necessary and why it is being done. TMK holders should have, to the greatest extent possible, a common direction for the use of documentation. TMK holders or community representatives should establish, preferably in writing, that community members were informed in advance of any efforts to document or use TMK outside of its traditional context. This may require communicating the following information: the purpose of the proposed documentation, collaboration or research, including any commercial plans; options for participation by stakeholders; disclosure of the po tential value of transferred knowledge or GRs; potential outcomes, including the likelihood of commercial success; rights available to stakeholders under the law; and options for benefit -sharing.189 TMK holders should also agree upon equitable benefit -shari ng before any potential commercial activities are undertaken. After identifying community goals and interests, TMK holders need to determine the most appropriate form of documentation. Different sources of TMK such as oral traditions, written texts, me dical practices, biological materials and GRs may have different documentation requirements. For example, GRs may require laboratory investigation to compile genetic code suitable for basic research. Medical practices involving ritual music may not be ad equately described in writing. Where TMK is part of a whole medical system, such as traditional Arabic medicine, the suitability of documentation for practitioner use should be considered. Documentation may need input from a variety of sources, including TMK holders, experts and community members. 188 See, e.g., WIPO, The World Intellectual Property Organization Traditional Knowledge Documentation Toolkit, (Nov. 1, 2013), available at http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/tk/en/resources/pdf/tk_toolkit_draft.pdf. 189 Daniel Putterman, Incorporatin g Genetic Resource Utilization into ICZM - Policies and Institutions in Jamaica, at 189, in Kent Gustavson et Al ., eds., Integrated Coastal zone Management of Coral Reefs: Decision Support Modeling (World Bank 2000), available at http://www.oas.org/dsd/IA BIN/Component1/ReefFix/Mobay%20Book/Chap%2012 -13%20Anexos.pdf. 35 The question of the most appropriate form for documentation to take is also dependent on the type of IP protection being sought. Patents, for example, generally require a written description of any new inven tion that sufficiently describes the invention and how to use it. If TMK is to be protected under a trade secret regime, documentation of how to replicate TMK must be undertaken with caution. Access to the documentation must be strictly limited to mainta in its secret character. There is no widely accepted template for documenting TMK, and given the variation within traditional medicine, there is no single \"best\" way to document. If TMK is being documented to develop innovations or improve the use of traditional medicine, extensi ve data may be necessary. In the case of herbal medicines, information related to herb gathering, cultivation, preparation, storage and the differences between various species of a particular herb can all be important to TM use. Clinical information on h erbal medicine use, including indications and contraindications, dosages, toxicity and side -effects, methods of administration and combinations of herbs is likewise important. TMK holders should carefully consider how and under what conditions access to documentation will be permitted. It is important that TMK holders be adequately informed to safeguard their reputations and interests when interacting with third parties. TMK holders may wish to consider providing access only under licensing agreements. 3. TRADITIONAL KNOWL EDGE DATABASES A database is a collection of related information, and traditional knowledge databases (TKDB) refer to compilations of traditional knowledge. Databases exist in many different forms. They may be compilations of pr inted material, or information may be stored electronically. Electronic databases, in turn, may be simple and publicly accessible, or complex with varying levels of restrictions on information access. For example, access may be reserved for the exclusive use of indigenous and local communities and protected under customary law. Three principal types of TKDBs exist: community TKDBs managed by indigenous communities, external TKDBs managed by non -community collaborators, and TK registers which are usually managed by governments or organizations. TMK holders may create, develop and maintain databases directly, with or without external assistance. If TMK holders are documenting TMK independently, the process of collecting information essentially creates a database. Community TKDBs have the advanta ge of permitting TMK holders a high degree of control over documented TMK. Sophisticated electronic databases, however, can be expensive and technically challenging to develop. An example of a community TKDB is the Kaska Traditional Knowledge Network (KTKN) in British Columbia, Canada.190 Databases created by external collaborators are the most common form of TKDB.191 These may be maintained by organizations including universities, museums, corporations, and NGOs. External collaborators have a variety of motivations for maintaining databases, such as to provide legal protection for traditional knowledge or to make knowledge easily accessible to facilitate academic research. Some of these databases have been created with the participation of TMK holders, b ut others simply consist of information claimed to be 190 United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), Composite Report on the Status and Trends Regarding the Knowledge, Innovations and Practices of Indigenous and Local Communities, UNEP/CBD/WG8J/4/ INF/9 (Dec. 21, 2005), p. 11. 191 Id. at 12. 36 in the public domain. Examples include the World Bank Database of Indigenous Knowledge and Practices and the Honeybee Network .192 Registers usually function to help establish legal rights. Publication of information in a registry puts the public on notice that the registrant asserts a claim. For example, submission of documented TMK to a register may establish positive rights of ownership or may be used to prevent patents based on misappropriation. Panama established a special registry through legislation designed to help indigenous peoples gain property rights over traditional knowledge.193 Rights over TK under this law are not recognized until knowledge is registered in the national Collective Regist er for Intellectual Property administered by the Direcci\u00f3n Nacional de Derechos de Autor .194 Peru has a sui generis regime for traditional knowledge that establishes registers to preserve and safeguard TK, and to provide the National Institute for the Defen se of Competition and Intellectual Property Protection (INDECOPI) information necessary to defend the interests of indigenous peoples.195 TK is stored in three types of registers.196 It may be stored in a public register, in a confidential register administe red by the government and inaccessible by third parties, or in local registers organized by indigenous peoples directly, with government technical assistance available upon request. INDECOPI sh ould provide information in the Public National Register to na tional patent offices in order to prevent patents it views as misappropriation.197 Applications for registration must include a clear and full description of the TK being registered, known use of related biological resources, and a designation of biological resources relevant to the TK.198 External databases and public registries may be particularly useful for defensive protection of TMK. These may be placed online for open -access in formats useful to patent examiners. Information simply stored in database s or posted on the internet, even if publicly accessible, may not be searchable or useable to patent examiners.199 If TMK holders are considering partnership with an externally controlled database, they should understand how information in the database is s tored, who owns the information, and whether there are limitations on access and use. 4. EXTERNAL COLLABOR ATIONS TMK holders may elect to collaborate with outside individuals or organizations in order to protect IPRs or to commercialize traditional medicines. There are many ways to structure such partnerships, and forming and maintaining collaborations can be challe nging for TMK holders who may lack experience in this area. TMK holders should exercise caution prior to entering into agreements with academic institutions or pharmaceutical companies interested in researching or commercializing TMK. TMK holders may wis h to consult experts on any proposed collaboration and seek legal counsel. Guidance for TMK holders may be available from government agencies such as INDECOPI, and non -governmental 192 World Bank Database of Indigenous Knowledge and Practices, http://www.worldbank.org/afr/ik/datab.htm ); The Honey Bee Network (http://www.sristi.org/honeybee.html. 193 Law on the Special Intellectual Property Regime with Respect to the Collective Rights of Indigenous Peoples to the Protection and Defense of their Cultural Identity and Traditional Knowledge, 26 June 2000, Law No. 20 (Panama). 194 UNEP/CBD/WG8J/4/INF/9, sup ra note 190, at 20. 195 Law Introducing a Protection Regime for the Collective Knowledge of Indigenous Peoples Derived from Biological Resources, 2002, Law No. 27,811 (Peru), Art. 16, available at http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/details.jsp?id=3420. 196 Id. at Art. 15. 197 Id. at Art. 23. 198 Id. at Art. 20. 199 WIPO, Intergovernmental Committee on Intellectual Property and Genetic Resources, Traditional Knowledge and Folklore, Inventory of existing online databases containing traditional knowledge documentation data, WIPO/GRTKF/IC/3/6 (May 10, 2002), available a t http://www.wipo.int/edocs/mdocs/tk/en/wipo_grtkf_ic_3/wipo_grtkf_ic_3_6 -main1.pdf. 37 organizations (NGOs) such as the Bioresources Development and Conservation Program (BDCP). Outside parties may have different motivations for collaborating with TMK holders. Pharmaceutical companies may wish to utilize TMK purely for commercial purposes such as bioprospecting, new drug development or dietary supplement manuf acturing. Academic institutions may wish to study TMK to understand how and why traditional medicine works. Increasingly, many academic institutions are functioning as for -profit research centers. UNIVERSITY OF ILLINO IS AT CHICAGO BENEFI T-SHARING POLI CY The University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) has a policy on benefit -sharing from research on drugs derived from natural products.200 Researchers from UIC collaborate with counterparts in other countries who supply plant genetic material. In the event t hat UIC researchers discover a new compound for which patent protection is sought, co -inventorship is awarded to scientists from the host country that played an inventive role in the discovery. In addition, net royalty income paid to the University from l icensing to pharmaceutical firms is shared, with one -half paid to a Trust Fund for the benefit of the country of origin of the genetic material. TMK holders should consider establishing the rights and responsibilities of all parties in writing prior to any proposed collaboration. Contracts, which are legally binding agreements between parties, may be used to enforce access and benefit -sharing agreements, maintain confidentiality of trade secrets, license the use of knowledge, or govern the transfer of GRs. If a proposed collaboration is likely to result in IPRs, a contract should establish who will own or control those rights, and how they may be used.201 Confidentiality, or non -disclosure, agreements keep transferred information private. They may prev ent collaborators from sharing knowledge publicly or with other parties. Confidentiality agreements may be necessary to maintain trade secret protection. Trade secret protection only applies to information for which reasonable steps have been taken to protect against disclosure. Licensing agreements grant rights to a licensee to use protected subject matter. These agreements may permit TMK holders to determine who will control knowledge and how it will be used. TMK holders can transfer the entire rig ht to control knowledge to a third party, or only the right to use knowledge for a limited time, specific purpose, or in a particular geographical area. Licenses can be granted to a single party, or to an unlimited number of parties. Material transfer agreements (MTAs) govern the transfer of research materials between two parties. They define the rights and responsibility of both parties with respect to the materials. This type of contract is frequently used with the transfer of GRs, and may specify c onditions for access and permitted uses of the resources. MTAs are common between academic or research institutions and private industry. External collaborators may offer benefits in return for the ability to use TMK. This may include monetary compens ation in the form of advance payments for access to TMK or royalty payments made after commercialization of a final product. Indigenous communities may also benefit from capacity building in human resources (training) and infrastructure 200 WHO/EDM/TRM/2001.1, supra note 1 51 at 30 . 201 WIPO, Draft Intellectual Property Guidelines for Access to Genetic Resources and Equitable Sharing of the Benefits arising from their Utilization: Consultation Draft, (Feb. 4, 2013), available at http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/tk/en/resources/pdf/draft_guidelines_feb_2013.pdf . These draft guidelines provide practical information for providers and recipients of GRs and re levant policy and legal information. 38 (e.g., computer eq uipment, roads), and from establishing long -term collaborative relationships. The distribution of financial benefits may be governed by national laws, and may, for example, require payments for benefit -sharing to go to a community trust fund or government agency rather than to specific individuals. TMK holders should ensure that the details of any proposed collaboration are clearly agreed upon prior to the initiation of any substantive discussion. At the least, it is important that TMK holders understa nd what the collaboration will entail and that an informed decision is made. Outside collaborations have historically met with varying degrees of success. CONTROVERSIAL COLLAB ORATIONS In 1995, the University of Zimbabwe and the Swiss University of Lausanne signed an agreement to collaborate on traditional medicine research. The agreement stipulated that joint patent applications would be made for any collaborative innovations, and that future royalty payments from any licensing agreements would be jointly negotiated. The University of Zimbabwe then provided TMK and GRs to the University of Lausanne. The University of Zimbabwe in turn had been assisted by the Zimbabwe National Healer s' Association (ZINATHA). ZINATHA provided the University of Zimbabwe with TMK and medicinal herbs from the African tree, \"Swartzia madagascariensis\" . The University of Zimbabwe did not inform the national government or the traditional healers of its agr eement with the University of Lausanne.202 In 1997, the University of Lausanne filed a U.S. patent for anti -microbial compounds termed \"diterpenes\" .203 The patent application acknowledged these new compounds relied on TMK and GRs from Zimbabwe. The University of Lausanne then entered into a licensing agreement with Phytera, an American pharmaceutical company, to market diterpenes. The University of La usanne also decided the percentage of royalty payments it would contribute to the National Herbarium and the Botanical Garden of Zimbabwe and to the Department of Pharmacy at the University of Zimbabwe.204 When details of the patent application and these ag reements were made public, the University of Lausanne was denounced by the Berne Declaration, an international non - governmental organization (NGO), and two NGOs from Zimbabwe, the Community Technology and Development Association (CTDA) and ZINATHA. The NG Os claimed that neither Zimbabwe nor the traditional healers affected by the bioprospecting gave prior informed consent for the use of local GRs, and also that the University of Lausanne violated its contract with the University of Zimbabwe by excluding it from licensing negotiations with Phytera, and by unilaterally establishing a relatively low percentage of benefit -sharing for Zimbabwe.205 In 2003, the University of Lausanne agreed to renegotiate the controversial agreement. Phytera later discontinued i ts research on diterpenes after negative results emerged from clinical trials. 202 Carlos M.

PRACTICAL STRAT EGIES FOR DOCUMENTAT ION General recommendations for documentation cannot replace individualized legal counsel. However, there are strategies that TMK holders may find useful to consider. A s indicated in The World Intellectual Property Organization Traditional Knowledge Documentation Toolkit (Nov. 1, 2013) ,206 though there is no mandatory sequence of steps to take in documenting TMK, the process can be roughly divided into three phases: before, during and after documentation. By far the most important phase of the documentation process occurs prior to documentation. It is during this time that TMK and stakeholders will be identified, a framework for documentation established, and goals and strategy agreed upon. 1. BEFORE D OCUMENTATION The first step to documenting traditional knowledge is to broadly identify the TMK in question. This may be anything from a whole medical system, such as that practiced by traditional healers in Africa and South America, to an individual her b or natural product. Identification of the relevant TMK is necessary to identify stakeholders in the documentation process and to establish a strategy. After deciding on the TMK to be documented, the second step is to determine who should be included in documentation efforts. This should include individuals traditionally entitled to possess or use the knowledge. This may also include persons who have non - traditionally acquired the knowledge, community members with a specific interest in the knowledge , the entire community or even other communities. There is no universal rule regarding who needs to be included in documentation efforts, but neglecting TMK holders with claim to the knowledge may generate challenges to IP later on (or claims of misapprop riation). Third -party collaborators may also be hesitant to partner with groups that do not have clear and uncontested rights to TMK. On the other hand, if knowledge is restricted to an individual or a particular group within a community, the rights to t hat knowledge may rest with those persons rather than the entire community. Some countries, such as Brazil, have laws that determine who must be included in documentation efforts.207 National laws may also determine who can own the IPRs to TMK, and who can benefit from commercialization. 206 WIPO, supra note 18 0. 207 The first ABS law in Brazil, MP 2186 -16, created a legal regime for authorizing access to GRs and associated TK, and the BS contract. The Act grants indigenous peoples and traditional communities certain legal rights over GRs within their territories. Thi rd-party access to GRs and associated TK requires PIC and BS agreements from indigenous peoples and traditional communities. After PIC and BS agreements are concluded, government permits must be obtained before access may be granted. Implementation of the Act began in April 2002 with the creation of the Department of Genetic Heritage (DPG), a division of the Ministry of Environment, and the first meeting of the Genetic Heritage Management Council (CGEN). CGEN is an organizational body composed of eight mini stries and ten federal organizations responsible for development of standards for access and benefit -sharing in Brazil's national territory. As of March 2009, CGEN had approved and registered 22 contracts for ABS. Eduardo V\u00e9le z, Brazil's Practical Experien ce with Access and Benefit -sharing and the Protection of Traditional Knowledge, June 2010 at 1 -2. Available more information on the legal regime for ABS to GRs and TMK in Brazil, see generally Tradi tional Knowledge and the Law Solutions for Access and Benefit Sharing (Evanson C. Kamau and Gerd Winter eds., Routledge 2009). 40 LOST OPPORTUNITIES I N BRAZIL The Krah\u00f4 Indians, one of the indigenous peoples living in Brazil, have a tradition of using plant based medicines in spiritual rituals and health care. In 2001, researchers at the Brazilian Federal University of S\u00e3o Paulo (UNIFESP), interested in developing moder n medicines from GRs and TMK, negotiated an access agreement with the Krah\u00f4 .208 The agreement established the prior informed consent of the Krah\u00f4 people from an organization, Vyty-Cati, which represented the three Krah\u00f4 villages involved in the research. I n the agreement, UNIFESP committed itself to invest in the Krah\u00f4 community and to share ownership of, and royalty payments from, any potential patents. After the conclusion of the agreement, UNIFESP researchers began removing indigenous GRs for laboratory research and interviewing shamans regarding their traditional knowledge.209 After learning of the agreement, the fourteen Krah\u00f4 villages that had not been consulted by UNIFESP, represented by the Kap\u00e9y organization, opposed continuation of the research and conditioned future negotiations on payment of moral damages and an upfront prospecting fee. A local Brazilian newspaper published an article denouncing \"bio -piracy\" practices, which had a negative im pact on the research activities of UNIFESP.210 Later attempts to negotiate a new access agreeement failed, and pha rmaceutical laboratories stated they were unwilling to finance the project due to concerns that new accusations of bio-piracy might be raised.211 The result was that a project that could have brought tangible benefits to both indigenous communities and Brazilian society did not materialize because of dispute over who should represent TMK holders. Partially in response to this incident, Brazil's Council for the Management of Genetic Patrimony (CGEN) now requires an independent anthropological study before obtaining prior informed consent in order to ensure fair representation of TMK holders.212 At a minimum, an independent anthropological study mu st determine the community's forms of social organization and political representation, the extent to which the community has been informed about the content of a proposal and its consequences, the social and cultural impacts arising from a project, the pr ocedure used to obtain consent, and the degree of respect for the process in which prior informed consent is to be obtained.213 TMK holders should decide how they will be organized. Will everyone be completely engaged in every step of documentation, or wi ll only some group members have responsibility (an IP committee)? If documentation is expected to result in financial benefits, how will money be distributed or shared? If possible, major decisions should be by consensus, but different stakeholders may hav e different goals for documentation (or even oppose documentation). There is no simple answer to how differences should be resolved. If acquisition of IPRs and collective ownership are desired, there may be advantages to forming an official business enti ty recognized in the country of origin. Business entities may be able to hold IPRs collectively in place of a group of individuals. 208 Tania Bubela et al., Respecting, Promoting, and Protecting Traditional Knowledge: A Comparative Case Study of Brazil, Kenya a nd Northern Canada, Working Document prepared for the International Expert Group on Biotechnology, Innovation and Intellectual Property, at 45 n.188, available at http://www.theinnovationpartnership.org/data/ieg/documents/cases/TIP_TK_Case_Study.pdf .

Kamau and Gerd Winter, EDS., Genetic Resources, Traditional Knowledge and the Law Solutions for Access and Benefit Sharing , (Earthscan 2009) at 314. 41 It is important that clear goals be established for documentation. If commercialization is a goal, TMK holders should m aintain reasonable expectations regarding financial benefits from documentation. Although some TMK has proven lucrative, other TMK has not. It can be very challenging to capitalize directly from TMK. Determining the why of documentation will help determine strategy. Existing forms of documentation should be identified. TMK may be recorded in, for example, written and electronic databases, modern and traditional texts (in a variety of languages), oral traditions, film s, photographs, songs, poetry, theatrical performances, community ceremonies, and other daily activities. TMK may be available outside the community (from scientists, academics or community members living elsewhere), within the community or only within ce rtain portions of the community (for example particular families or health care providers). Ideally, all sources of documentation should be accounted for as awareness of existing sources of documentation will help inform collection and IP strategies. Knowledge not already in written form should not be written down until a complete documentation strategy is in place. TMK holders should identify financial and human resources available for documentation. Depending on the knowledge in question, documentat ion can be costly and time-consuming. It may also require subject matter expertise. For example, traditional healers may need to be involved in documenting oral traditions or persons with language skills may be necessary to translate written texts. If d ocumentation in electronic registries is desired, this requires computer equipment and technical expertise. External collaborators may be able to assist with documentation. However, TMK holders should exercise caution prior to sharing knowledge with th ird parties. For example, anthropologists from developed country universities may have valuable expertise in documenting traditional practices, but there may be concerns about transmitting knowledge outside of the community. The details of any proposed c ollaboration should be clearly agreed upon prior to the initiation of any substantive discussion, and should be governed by written contract rather than relying on informal agreements. TMK holders may also obtain assistance from multinational organization s, governments or non -governmental organizations. Once the goals of documentation and existing sources of documentation are established, an IP strategy should be developed. In creating this strategy, TMK holders should consider the entire range of options available to meet their objectives as well as the implications of those options. TMK holders should also consider which protections are still possible. For example, if the TMK is widely known outside of the community of origin it may no longer be eligible for trade secret or patent protection. However , just because information is publicly available does not mean it should not be documented. Some forms of IP protection may still be possible, and there may be other benefits from documentation. The IP strategy will help determine the format for docume ntation. Because it is hard to know in advance what knowledge will prove useful in the future, it may be advisable to document as comprehensively as possible. In addition to recording TMK in writing, documentation may include videos, maps, photographs, d rawings and physical specimens (for example of plants). A documentation plan should be created to detail exactly how data will be acquired and a timeline. If documentation is intended to help disseminate knowledge outside of the community of origin the n it should be documented in a manner that is easily comprehended by third parties that lack specific background in TMK. If a product is being described, documentation should include all known names, variations, and both traditional and modern uses. For example, if a traditional Chinese herbal formula is being documented, relevant 42 information may include the name of the herbal medicine in Chinese, English and Latin, when it was developed and by whom, the names of all the ingredients, modifications of ingredients and associated effects, different methods of preparation, indications, contraindications, dosages, side -effects, modern uses and claims supported by scientific evidence. If a process is being described, documentation should detail every step in the process, including all of the required materials and any information necessary to allow someone else to recreate the process. It should also describe the results of the process and any possible variations. Documentation should also contain the name, location and contact information of stakeholders claiming ownership. If stakeholders want patent offices to consider documentation in evaluating IP applications, information should be recorded in a format easily accessible to examiners and in the approp riate national language. For example, the United States of America Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) requires documentation to be provided in English. The Indian Traditional Knowledge Digital Library (TKDL) provides information in English, French, Germ an, Japanese and Spanish. The TKDL organizes entries based on International Patent Classification (IPC), a language independent classification system for the organization of patents (and utility models).214 IPC is used internationally by patent offices f or organizing conventional, non - traditional knowledge based patents. The TKDL also utilizes a specially developed classification system, the Traditional Knowledge Resource Classification (TKRC), which provides greater definition of traditional knowledge i nformation by expanding IPC groups into sections, classes, subclasses, groups and subgroups. For example, the TKRC system expands one IPC group (i.e., AK61K35/78 related to medicinal plants) into about 5000 subgroups.215 A WIPO -TK Task Force consisting of representatives from patent offices in the United States of America, European Union, Japan, China and India provided input into this system and linking it with existing IPC.216 Data is also significantly more accessible to researchers and patent examiners i f provided in an electronic, searchable database. The TKDL is searchable by multiple methods, including keyword, botanical name, disease and IPC code. Finally, while full stakeholder involvement should be obtained as early as possible, it should be obt ained no later than the beginning of the documentation. If possible, everyone with a claim to TMK should be in agreement regarding goals and strategy. Written evidence of prior informed consent to documentation and future uses of traditional knowledge sh ould be obtained. Any agreement regarding benefit -sharing should also be obtained in writing. 214 Utility models are similar to patents, but usually with shorter terms and less stringent patentability requirements. See generally http://www.wipo.int/classifications/ipc/en/. 215 WIPO, World Trade Organization, TRIPS on Intellectual Property Rights, Integrating Intellectual Property Rights and Development Policy (Sept. 2002), at 81, available at http://www.cipr.org.uk/papers/pdfs/final_report/CIPRcoverintrofinal.pdf. 216 WIPO, Special Union for the In ternational Patent Classification (IPC Union), IPC/CE/31/6 (Feb. 18, 2002), available at http://www.wipo.int/edocs/mdocs/classifications/en/ipc_ce_31/ipc_ce_31_6.pdf. 43 PRE-DOCUMENTATION CHECKL IST Identify the relevant TMK. Gather stakeholders, decide on organization. Establish clear objectives for documentation. Identify existing sources of knowledge. Assess available financial and human resources. Consult with experts. Develop an IP strategy based on goals and objectives. Determine documentation format, create a documentation plan. Achieve stakeholder consensus prior to beginning documentation. Obtain prior informed consent in writing, and benefit -sharing arrangements if applicable. DO: - - Engage the entire stakeholder community. - Obtain expert advice from recognized authorities. - Consult legal experts throughout this phase. - Make deliberate and informed decisions. - Base strategies on clear goals. - Understand relevant national laws and regulations. DO NOT: - - Document TMK in this phase. - Disclose TMK outside the stakeholder community. - Share information with third parties except as part of an informed strategy. 2. DURING DOCUMENTAT ION As documentation proceeds it should follow the pre -documentation strategy and format. However, adjustments may be necessary if, for example, unexpected TMK is encountered or if unforeseen parties claim interest in the subject matter. Events that occur outside the community may also impact the documentation process, for instance, if a third - party independently patents TMK that is the subject of documentation efforts. Any significant changes to the documentation plan or IP strategy should be approved by al l stakeholders. If TMK holders are not conducting documentation efforts directly, they should remain connected to the process. Regular meetings should occur to evaluate progress, and TMK holders should have a plan to monitor and verify that documented TM K is being used as agreed. Once the documentation phase is ready to begin, the first step should be to comprehensively gather all existing sources of documentation. Based on existing documentation, stakeholders should evaluate where gaps in knowledge e xist. If the documentation plan calls for comprehensive information collection then all modern and traditional information related to TMK should be recorded. This includes traditional terms and concepts as well as local names. For example, in addition to its modern role in treating peptic ulcer disease, the Chinese herbal formula Yi Wei Tang treats 44 \"yin deficiency\" from a traditional perspective.217 Terminology of this nature is useful to include in documentation, however it may not be easily comprehens ible to outside parties. A dictionary or glossary of special terms or phrases used to describe TMK should be developed. Any customary laws or practices should also be recorded. Consider an entry in the TKDL as an example.218 For each traditional knowle dge- based product, documentation is provided for title, IPC and TKRC code, details of process/formulation, therapeutic composition, preparation, dosage, mode of administration, indications and a list of publications containing the knowledge. Documentati on should also include basic bibliographic information associated with TK, for instance the names, addresses and contact data of information providers and custodians of TK and GRs.219 This should include the date and time information is collected and the si te where TMK is recorded. If relevant, documentation should include conditions for access and use, including socio/cultural taboos and restrictions, as well as information on arrangements with TMK holders.220 Depending on the goals of documentation, TMK holders may wish to prioritize the documentation of specific traditional knowledge. For example, if preservation of TMK is a goal, knowledge at risk of disappearance (through loss of traditional healers, langua ge, or natural habitat) should be documented first. If preventing third parties from applying for IP based on TMK is a goal, knowledge with commercial applications should be prioritized. This includes efforts by the Indian government to document yoga pra ctices in video. If external collaborators are involved in documentation efforts, these relationships should be carefully managed and the confidentiality of documentation maintained. Contracts directly between TMK holders and collaborators are generall y advisable, which should have been concluded prior to beginning documentation. DURING DOCUMEN TATION CHECKLIST Compile all existing documentation. Determine knowledge gaps. While documenting, include all relevant modern and traditional know ledge. Conduct regular meetings to evaluate progress and adherence to pre -documentation strategy. DO: - - Document in a consistent and thorough manner. - Ensure documentation follows the agreed approach. - Consult with all stakeholders regarding any changes to pre -documentation plans. - Maintain knowledge holder involvement. - Identify sources of knowledge and stakeholders who claim ownership. - Create a dictionary of traditional terms and phrases. - Ensure confidentiality from external collaborators if applicable. 217Anshen Shi, Etal, Essentials of Chinese Medicine: Internal Medicine , 379, (Bridge Pub. Group 2003). 218 See generally http://www.tkdl.res.in/tkdl/langdefault/common/Home.asp?GL=Eng. 219 Technical Proposals to the WIPO Intergovernmental Committee on IP and Genetic Resources, Traditional Knowledge and Folklore, WIPO/GRTKF/IC/4/14, Proposal by the Asian Group, 6 December 2002, annex, p. 8; adopted by the 5th Session of the IGC (WIPO/GRTKF/IC/5/15). 220 Id. 45 DO NOT: - - Disclose any TMK outside of the community unless an informed decision has been made to this extent. - Share information with third parties except as part of an informed strategy. 3. AFTER DOCUMENTATI ON After documentation has been completed, TMK holders will have to manage documented TMK. This may involve applying for IP protections based on documentation or disseminating the collected knowledge. A clear understanding of how doc umentation will be used should be in place prior to initiating documentation. Nevertheless, stakeholders should review the different forms of IP discussed earlier and reconsider all available options. For example, if patent protection for TMK is desire d, TMK holders should consult with a patent attorney/agent, as applying for a patent is a complex task requiring legal expertise. TMK holders should also be familiar with national sui generis systems of protection, which may impact obtaining IPRs. For ex ample, the protection of TCM inventions in China is effectively integrated with the regular patent system. It is reported that about 4,000 applications a year are submitted in this field domestically.221 An increasing number of these patents are also enter ing the international patent system.222 Although patents are granted nationally, WIPO maintains an \"international\" patent application system in which a single application is transmitted to multiple countries.223 As part of the IP strategy created prior to documentation, TMK holders may wish to form a business entity to collectively own and administer IPRs if they have not already done so. Here, legal advice is important to select the proper form of organization. Different ownership structures have different advantages and disadvantages, such as possible tax benefits or reduced personal liability. It is important to choose the most appropriate structure initially, for instance a corporation rather than a partners hip, as changing forms of ownership later may be very difficult and costly. The specific structure of a business entity, for example how decisions will be made or how benefits will be distributed, may be shaped by contract, within the requirements of nati onal law. Controlling IPRs collectively can be challenging due to the potential for internal disputes. One collaborator may block the whole team on the basis of an individual right. Internal disputes should be anticipated at the outset of an IP strate gy, and rules to resolve internal disputes should be established by contract prior to applying for IP ownership. Otherwise, and possibly even with a contract to the contrary, internal disputes may be governed by national law. This may not be in the best interest of TMK holders. For example, in the U.S. and France, patent law authorizes each of the joint owners of a patent to exploit the invention without the consent of the other owners.224 In Germany, copyright law permits alterations to a jointly created work only with the consent of all authors.225 However, a joint author may not unreasonably refuse consent to publish, exploit or alter a joint work. 221 Von Lewinski, supra note 14 2, at 124. 222 Id. See, e.g., PCT application WO/2004/052382 (publishing 24 June 2004), for \"A Kind of Traditional Chine se Medicine Having Efficacy of Reducing Blood -Fat\". 223 WIPO, Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) (1970), http://www.wipo.int/pct/en/treaty/about.html. 224 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 262 and Art. L613 -29 CPI. 225 Sec. 8(2) German Copyright http://www.gesetze -im-internet.de/urhg/ (accessed Feb. 28, 2011 - Last Visited Sept. 29, 2013). 46 If the decision has been made to keep documentation confidential, for example as part of a strategy to m aintain trade secrets related to TMK, then TMK holders should carefully restrict access to documentation. Its commercial value will be significantly lessened once knowledge becomes public. If TMK is being transmitted to external collaborators, this shoul d be done under contract with confidentiality restrictions so that reasonable steps are taken to protect the knowledge. For example, a confidentiality clause could be written into research agreements to stipulate the recipient of such knowledge would be granted the right to use it in research and development but could not divulge the knowledge publicly. If considering partnerships with third parties, stakeholders may have a stronger bargaining position with external collaborators once they have taken the initiative to document TMK. If documented knowledge is required for regulatory submissions, stakeholders should determine in advance whether that information will be kept confidential, and if so for how long. For example, to approve a foreign traditional medicine for marketing appro val in Brazil, the Brazilian regulatory authority requires data to be submitted on clinical safety and efficacy. However, as a general matter, regulatory submissions may release data into the public domain. This may also apply to documentation submitted to IPOs to invalidate patents based on misappropriated TMK. For information submitted to patent offices to be kept confidential, special licensing agreements may be necessary. Submitting documentation to IPOs may affect available IP protections. TMK hol ders should be completely informed prior to any uses of documentation. FIRST NATIONS CONFID ENTIALITY MANAGEMENT The First Nation of Na -Cho Nyak Dun is an indigenous community in the Yukon Territory in Canada.226 The First Nation of Na -Cho Nyak Dun Gover nment maintains holdings of documented traditional knowledge, and it serves as the primary contact for requests to access community traditional knowledge. The Government has established safeguards and information management systems that enable it to gathe r knowledge and ensure appropriate and respectful use.227 The Government determines the sensitivity of traditional knowledge and accordingly restricts access . Knowledge is categorized as low sensitivity (information commonly known outside the community), medium sensitivity (information known only to those within the traditional community), and high sensitivity (spiritual information known only according to customary laws or information which might harm the community if it was released) . Based on sensitivi ty, access to knowledge is permitted for full disclosure, partial disclosure, in - house access only, or no disclosure . Methods for restricting access include preventing reproductions of documentation or electronic exchange of information . The Government protects against unauthorized disclosure by limiting information access to authorized employees, specifying which additional persons may access information, and allowing users only to view information (prohibiting copying and distribution) . Confidential data in electronic databases is further protected by allowing sign -on only by authorized staff, and by using passwords and read - only formatting . 226 See generally First Nation of Na -Cho Nyak Nyak Dun, History, http://nndfn.com/history/ . 227 See Na -Cho Nyak Nyak Dun, http://nndfn.com/images/uploads/pdfs/NNDFN_Traditional_Knowledge_Framework.pdf , pg 8-11. 47 Prior to disclosure of traditional knowledge outside the community, the Government requires an agreement with knowledge recipients identifying the level of disclosure, the terms and conditions for sharing the information, the steps the third party will take to ensure confidentiality (when required) is maintained, the purpose for which the traditional knowledg e can be used and ultimate ownership of traditional knowledge that has been gathered . If documentation is intended strictly to defensively protect against misappropriation and to disseminate TMK, then disclosed knowledge should be easily locatable by patent examiners during a search for prior art . TMK holders should consider submitting information to an established traditional knowledge dat abase or registry for this purpose . In U.S. patent law, evidence of prior art outside the United States of America requires a printed publication describing the invention . Publication may occur in scientific journals, newspapers, magazines, websites, etc . The European patent system does not limit evidence of prior art to printed publications, and includes everything made available to the public in writing or orally before the date of filing the patent application . If evidence of prior art is not found during the patent filing process and a patent is granted, the costs to have an existing patent invalidated may be significant . Disclosure and publication of TMK may be anonymous . If TMK holders are uncertain regarding disclosure of documentation, it may be better not to disclose . A decision to disseminate TMK can always be made at a later time, whereas disseminated knowledge cannot be recalled . On the other hand, it may be burdensome and expensive to challenge IPRs once they are granted . POST -DOC UMENTATION CHECKLIST Carefully monitor/restrict access to, and use of, documentation . Verify planning objectives have been met . Consult with all stakeholders to address remaining concerns . Reconsider applications for IP protection . Revie w collaborations with third parties . Update documentation as new knowledge develops . DO: - - Evaluate all possibilities for IP protection . - Continue consultations with experts . - Consider how documentation can be used to the greatest benefit of the community and to those outside the community . DO NOT: - - Disclose any TMK outside of the community unless an informed decision has been made to this extent . - Share information with third parties except as part of an informed strategy . 48 ABOUT THE AUTHOR Ryan Abbott, M .D., J.D., M.T.O.M., is Associate Professor of Law at Southwestern Law School and Visiting Assistant Professor of Medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA .
