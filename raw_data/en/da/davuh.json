The secret's out. Horses know how good Buckeye\u00ae Nutrition is. So do horse owners. For over 100 years, we've been quietly producing horse feed of unsurpassed quality. We've perfected the art and science of equine nutrition and put into play quality assurance standards that are far from standard. We implement many programs mandated in human food manufacturing facilities. We rely on local farms for grain to make our feed the best it can be. One look at a Buckeye \u00ae Nutrition horse and it's no secret what feed he's on.

Current Position: Partner in Von Bluecher, Blea, Hunkin Inc., Equine Medicine and Surgery, a five-veterinarian Thoroughbred racetrack practice in Southern California. Describe how you ventured into equine veterinary medicine?My family always had riding horses and, eventually, racehorses. My grandfather would take us riding after school and on weekends. When my family moved to New Orleans in the 1970s, my father trained racehorses, and my brother and I were at the track helping him every chance we could. As time passed, I decided to start galloping racehorses, and eventually started riding in races in the early 1980s. I enjoyed the people and the horses at the racetrack, and when my brief career as a jockey ended, a trainer that I rode for suggested that I go to vet school. I always knew that my life would involve horses, and his advice resonated deeply in me. What issues in equine veterinary medicine are top priorities for you and why? We, as equine practitioners, are losing our respected role as the voice of authority for the health and welfare of the horse, and we, as a profession, need to figure out how to regain that role in the face of escalating challenges from the lay individual. Currently there are farriers taking radiographs and providing a diagnosis and treatment; lay dentists performing medical procedures without proper training; drug companies selling bulk product to trainers, farms and owners without a valid VCPR; and the list goes on. Government agencies are in place to protect the public from the veterinarian, yet there is no protection from the unlicensed paraprofessionals. Another issue that is important to me is medication uniformity and integrity in horse racing. AAEP has played an integral role in improving the sport and continues to focus on what is best for the horse, its members, and the industry. As an association, we need to keep our focus on what is best for the horse. How has your AAEP membership influenced your career? Through the years I have been fortunate to meet and interact with many AAEP members who provided mentorship, while others became great friends and colleagues. It is an organization of talented, ethical and passionate individuals who share a common goal. Because of these relationships, I have become a better practitioner in many regards and have come to appreciate organized veterinary medicine and how to solve problems within the context of organized associations. What do you consider to be your greatest contribution to the equine veterinary profession?I'm not sure I've reached that pinnacle yet. I'm quite proud that many of the students who have externed with our practice left us with a better appreciation of veterinary medicine at the racetrack, a better understanding of the industry, and a respect for the racetrack practitioner. What goals do you have for your term as AAEP president? One of my main goals is to resurrect the veterinarian's role as the expert for the health and welfare of the horse. As a profession, we are well trained for this role; however, we are not well branded, nor are we vocal about our position. Other goals are to continue: How have your experiences as a veterinarian and member of the AAEP prepared you to lead the association?I've learned to listen more and talk less - qualities that have served me well in practice. It's critical to listen to the discussion to determine if, in fact, an issue exists before attempting to resolve any conflict. As a racetrack practitio-ner, my job is to solve problems and promote the success of the team; that applies to my role in AAEP as well.Please describe your interests outside of veterinary medicine.I enjoy spending quality time with my wife and our two daughters. Our favorite place to go is Jackson Hole, Wyo., where we just truly enjoy the outdoors and its beauty. Fly-fishing in Wyoming is something that I truly enjoy, and I hope to improve my technique in the years to come. Meet 2014 AAEP President Dr. Jeff Blea Dr. Jeff Blea IV EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JANUARY 2014 Practitioners, others overcome adverse weather to make Nashville a top-5 convention Nashville is known for its country music stars, but the city's real stars Dec. 7-11 were the 6,592 equine veterinarians, students, guests and exhibitors who persevered through inclement weather and travel delays across a wide swath of the United States to make the AAEP's 59 th Annual Convention the fourth-most attended ever. Their perseverance was rewarded with an outstanding educational program that featured 200 presentations and discussions during 34 educational sessions. Near-capacity attendance was commonplace in the meeting rooms during many of the featured sessions, and the critical area of lameness received special attention as the focus of at least one session each day. Supplementing the leading-edge information presented during the educational program were the latest technologies, services and products for equine practice from 340 trade show exhibitors. Students, meanwhile, benefited from a significantly expanded student program that included dry labs and career development sessions with veteran practitioners.\"While the weather certainly presented some initial challenges, it didn't diminish the enthusiasm of attendees,\" said AAEP Executive Director David Foley. \"I sincerely thank our program chair, Dr. Jeff Blea, and the entire Educational Programs Committee for assembling a program that received strong praise from attendees for its depth and practicality.\" AAEP Touch campaign launched During the opening session on Dec. 8, the AAEP launched Touch: Tools to Connect to Your Clients and Their Horses. Touch is a long-term investment into the practice success of AAEP members based on extensive research with thousands of horse owners and trainers. For more information about AAEP Touch, see the article on page IX. More than $84,000 generated for AAEP Foundation Combined proceeds from the live auction held during the 17th Annual Foundation Celebration, the second annual sporting clay shoot tournament and from individual donations totaled more than $84,000 in support of the AAEP Foundation's mission to improve the welfare of the horse.Annual awards bestowed on five members Five AAEP members were honored during the Dec. 10 President's Luncheon for their outstanding service on behalf of the horse and the association.

Fun and philanthropy merged at the Wildhorse Saloon during a sold-out Foundation Celebration. EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JANUARY 2014 V Lameness spotlighted during Milne Lecture Equine orthopaedic expert Dr. Sue Dyson equipped a standing-room only crowd of equine practitioners with the advanced knowledge necessary to diagnose and treat lameness during her Dec. 9 Frank J. Milne State-of-the-Art Lecture \"Equine Lameness: Clinical Judgment Meets Advanced Diagnostic Imaging.\" Describing the diagnosis of lameness as both art and science, Dr. Dyson said longeing is superior to trotting in hand on a circle during a lameness evaluation because it is easier to assess how the horse is holding its body, which may be an adaptation to pain. When observing a horse with a rider on its back, the practitioner should be cognizant of the rider's proficiency because a good rider can mask the appearance of lameness while a less-skilled rider can induce the appearance of lameness. A transcript of Dr. Dyson's presentation can be found in the 2013 AAEP Convention Proceedings book, beginning on page 92. Osteoarthritis researcher awarded 2013 Past Presidents' Research Fellow Colorado State University doctoral candidate Dr. Brad Nelson received the 2013 AAEP Foundation Past Presidents' Research Fellow for his research that seeks to detect cartilage injury in the early stages of osteoarthritis, which would enable institution of earlier treatments that have better success providing long-term comfort to the horse. The $5,000 grant, made possible through the monetary contributions of AAEP past presidents, is awarded annually to a doctoral or residency student who has made significant progress in the field of equine health care research. Dr. Nelson was recognized during intermission of the Frank J. Milne State-of-the-Art Lecture on Dec. 9. Researchers from Virginia Tech, Texas A&M receive 2013 EQUUS Foundation Research Fellows Virginia Tech equine surgery resident Dr. Kendra Freeman and Texas A&M University post-doctoral research associate Dr. Amanda-Jo Joswig received the 2013 EQUUS Foundation Research Fellows for their work to advance veterinary knowledge. Each received a $5,000 fellow during intermission of the Milne Lecture to support their endeavors in equine research. Dr. Freeman's research evaluates the effect of tendon repair techniques on intrinsic tendon vasculature. Meanwhile, Dr. Joswig's research investigates the use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in equine corneal ulcers as well as the safety of allogeneic MSCs used subconjunctivally. The fellows are supported in partnership by the AAEP Foundation and The EQUUS Foundation.

That dialogue - formalized as the Unwanted Horse Summit - spawned creation of the Unwanted Horse Coalition (UHC) with a mission to reduce the number of unwanted horses and to improve their welfare through education and the efforts of organizations committed to the health, safety, and responsible care and disposition of these horses. Placed under the auspices of the American Horse Council in June 2006, the initiative's timing proved opportune as the issue of unwanted horses would come into sharper focus soon thereafter as a result of a combination of factors, including the economic downturn, overproduction in the breeding shed, closing of the nation's processing facilities and high cost of euthanasia and carcass disposal. The AAEP is a founding member - and one of 27 members in total - of the UHC and supports the coalition through annual grant funding from the AAEP Foundation, whose mission to improve the welfare of the horse meshes with that of the UHC. In fact, one of the UHC's most visible programs, Operation Gelding, was instituted by the Foundation and continues to benefit from an annual grant specifically earmarked to the program. Since inception of the Operation Gelding Program in 2010, support from the AAEP Foundation has helped fund the castration of 837 stallions in 28 states. Not only do the castration clinics help prevent a future generation of potentially unwanted horses, they often provide equine veterinary students with practical skills training in the procedure. \"With the support of the AAEP Foundation, the Operation Gelding Program has become an industry role model for castration grant programs and has aided in the castration of almost 1,000 stallions and helped organizations around the country host over 70 clinics in the past three years,\" said UHC Director Ericka Caslin. \"We are truly grateful for the continued support of the Foundation that has helped benefit so many unwanted horses and horses in need.\"Additional grant funding from the AAEP Foundation supports the UHC's varied and ongoing efforts to fulfill its important mission. With education as a primary focus, the UHC is an information-rich resource for horse owners and others. Its website, www.unwantedhorsecoalition.org, provides a list by state of more than 700 facilities that accept horses as well as a directory of available resources for horse owners in need, including grant opportunities, haybanks, feedbanks, vaccination programs, castration clinics and more. Relevant information is also disseminated through the UHC Ambassador Program, which includes approximately 150 volunteer subject matter experts available by request to speak on the UHC's behalf at equine events. Each ambassador is provided with a PowerPoint presentation and supplemental materials to distribute. These materials and other brochures, flyers and documents - produced by the UHC and by its member organizations, including the AAEP - are available for free download on the UHC website or in hardcopy format. Among them is Best Practices: How Your Organization Can Help Unwanted Horses, a handbook for creation and operation of programs and activities to assist the unwanted horse based on already established and successful initiatives. As an industry-wide response to an industry-wide issue, the UHC is making inroads into the predicament of the unwanted horse and will continue to do so with the steadfast support of the AAEP, AAEP Foundation and other concerned and committed industry organizations.

During the 2013 Annual Convention, the AAEP unveiled this blueprint - a program exclusively for AAEP members that will help equine veterinarians provide better care to patients, develop long-term relationships with clients, and deliver the services horse owners and trainers most value. AAEP Touch: Tools to Connect to Your Clients and Their Horses was developed from market research conducted with more than 6,100 horse owners, trainers, breeders and farm managers in the United States. An independent market research firm conducted the study in fall 2012. The important findings from the research have been packaged into a comprehensive website of tools and resources that will help you understand your clients better than you already do. At touch.aaep.org, you will find the Top 10 lessons for your practice; profiles of 13 different client types based on the attributes they value most in veterinary care; videos and tools to help you perform a client-focused examination; client education materials on important topics that emerged from the research; and much more.

Adams, Stephen Ainsworth, EDUCATION / AE / JANUARY 2014Highlights of recent clinically relevant papers Sesamoidean approaches for digital flexor tendon sheath synoviocentesis and injection Richard Rocconi and Sarah Sampson from the Mississippi State University, USA, have recently published their study comparing basilar and axial sesamoidean approaches for digital flexor tendon sheath (DFTS) synoviocentesis and injection in horses. Accurate synoviocentesis and injection of the DFTS are important procedures for diagnosis and treatment of injuryassociated with this structure in horses. This study aimed todefine a method for the basilar sesamoidean approach (BSA)to the DFTS and compare it with the axial sesamoideanapproach (ASA) for DFTS synoviocentesis and injection. Twelve healthy adult mares with no lower limb abnormalities had one forelimb and one hindlimb assigned to each DFTSapproach. All procedures were performed in standingsedated horses. Median time for injection was significantly shorter for the BSA, compared with the ASA. The median number of times theneedle was redirected was also significantly less for the BSA.Odds of obtaining synovial fluid via the BSA were 5.7 times asgreat as for the ASA. Successful injection of contrast materialinto the DFTS did not differ significantly between methods. The authors concluded that the BSA was a useful method for DFTS synoviocentesis in the fore- and hindlimbs of standingsedated horses and was superior to the ASA in most aspects.This approach to the DFTS should be considered when DFTSinjection or synovial fluid retrieval is desired, particularly inhorses with minimal DFTS effusion. Melanoma in grey Quarter Horses R. Teixeira and colleagues in the USA have recently reportedon coat colour genotypes and risk and severity of melanomain grey Quarter Horses (QH). Both greying and melanoma formation in horses have recently been linked to a duplication in the STX17 gene. Thisduplication, as well as a mutation in the ASIP gene thatincreases MC1R pathway signalling, affects melanoma riskand severity in grey horses. This study was performed todetermine if melanoma susceptibility in grey QH is lower thangrey horses from other breeds because of decreased MC1Rsignalling resulting from a high incidence of the MC1R chestnutcoat colour allele in the QH population. Blood or hair rootsamples were collected from 335 grey QH with and withoutdermal melanomas for DNA extraction and ASIP and MC1R genotypes. Age, sex, and externalmelanoma presence and grade were recorded. Melanoma prevalence (16%) and grade (0.35) in this QH cohort was lower than that reported in other breeds. Agewas significantly associated with melanoma prevalenceand severity. No significant effect of MC1R genotype onmelanoma prevalence or severity was identified. An effect ofASIP genotype on melanoma risk was not detected. Low STX17homozygosity precluded evaluation of the grey allele effect.The authors concluded that melanoma prevalence andseverity is lower in this population of grey QH than has beenreported in other breeds. This could be because of theinfrequent STX17 homozygosity, a mitigating effect of theMC1R potentiation of melanoma, othergenes in the MC1R signalling pathway, or differences in breed genetic background. Comparison of anastomosis methods following proximal ileal resection This retrospective study by S. Stewart and colleagues from the University of Pennsylvania, USA, compares complications and survival rates with three different anastomosis methods following proximal ileal resection; namely jejunojejunostomy,jejunoileostomy and jejunocaecostomy. Medical records for 112 horses were reviewed and, as this was a retrospective study, the surgical procedure was notrandomised but was based on lesion type and surgeonpreference. Short-term outcome was measured by survival todischarge and was not different between groups. Those who underwent a jejunoileostomy were more likely to have a repeat celiotomy during the period of hospitalisation. Long-termfollow-up was measured using a Kaplan-Meier estimate ofsurvival function and found that horses who had undergone ajejunocaecostomy were more likely to have repeated episodesof colic and were less likely to survive long-term than those whohad undergone one of the alternative procedures. Survivalfollowing jejunoileostomy at one-year follow up was 100%,compared with 97% for jejunojejunostomy and 83% forjejunocaecostomy. The authors also noted that anastomosispattern may reflect outcome, with a double layer appositionalpattern performing best although numbers were too low to beof statistical significance. The authors concluded that following proximal ileal resection jejunoileostomy may be the anastomosis techniqueof choice due to better long-term survival rates and lowerincidence of colic in the long term. Mesenchymal stem cell administration methods In this study, J.M. Trela and colleagues from the University ofCalifornia, USA, used scintigraphy to compare intra-arterialinjection and distal intravenous regional limb perfusion of mesenchymal stem cells to the equine foot. Mesenchymal stem cells have recently been administered via a regional limb perfusion; however, previous studies have found that intravenous administration resulted in poor uptakeand intra-arterial injection resulted in thrombosis in some cases.This study used labelled mesenchymal stem cells andcompared intravenous and intra-arterial administration, withuptake being measured by scintigraphy. Six horses weresubjected to general anaesthesia and labelled mesenchymalstem cells were administered via a catheter placed in themedian artery of one forelimb, followed by the lateral palmardigital vein in the opposite forelimb. A tourniquet was usedonly for intravenous administration. Mesenchymal stem cellswere found to be retained in the distal limb despite not using atourniquet for intra-arterial injection. Contrary to previousstudies, there were no thrombi detected ultrasonographicallyfollowing the procedure for intra-arterial injection; however, inthe limb where the intravenous technique was used, thrombiwere detected in 4 of the 6 horses. The authors concluded that the tourniquet and resulting haemostasis was sufficient to create subclinical \u00a9 LtdEQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JANUARY 2014intra-arterial technique resulted in a more homogenous distribution of labelled mesenchymal stem cells than theintravenous technique, and both techniques resulted in asimilar uptake when measured at 24 h post injection. Doxorubicin chemotherapy in horses The aim of this study by A.P. Th\u00e9on and colleagues from theUniversity of California, USA, was to determine dose-limitingtoxicosis (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) ofdoxorubicin in tumour-bearing horses. Seventeen horses with 34 localised or multicentric advanced tumours were treated using a two-stagedose-ranging design involving intrapatient and interpatientdose escalation. Six treatment cycles were given at 3-week intervals with dosages ranging from 40 to 85 mg/m 2. Clinical signs were evaluated. Total doses ranged from 1127 to 2900 mg in 12 horses that completed the assigned treatment protocols. The MTDwas 75 mg/m 2. Hypersensitivity reactions and neutropenia were dose- andcycle-dependent but dose-escalation schedule invariant.Cardiotoxicity was not observed. The authors concluded that the recommended dosage of doxorubicin to treat horses is 70 mg/m 2given at 3-week as Equine exuberant granulation tissue and human keloids In this study, C. Theoret and colleagues in Canada and the USA compared histopathological features of afibroproliferative disorder in horses (exuberant granulationtissue) and humans (keloid). Archival tissue samples of exuberant granulation tissue (EGT) and keloid were used for scale for presence or absence ofulceration, keloidal collagen, myofibroblasts and elastic fibresas well as degree inflammation, fibrosis, vascularity andorientation of collagen fibres. Superficial dermis and deep dermis of both horses and humans had increased numbers of haphazardly orientedthickened collagen fibres; however, only keloids contained'keloidal' collagen. Fibroblast numbers were markedlyincreased in both groups but only EGT had myofibroblasts.Minimal vascularity was observed in the deep dermis bothgroups. The superficial dermis in EGT was characterised bysmall vessels within immature granulation tissue. Macrophagesand mast cells were infrequently found in both groups butpolymorphonuclear cells were markedly increased in EGT. Humans and horses are the only mammals known to naturally develop excessive granulation during woundhealing; however, similarities and differences betweenfibroblast populations and associated collagen have not beenreported. Inflammatory response may contribute to observeddifferences in the cellular populations, with EGT possessingmarkedly increased myofibroblasts, small vessels and acuteinflammatory cells compared with keloids. Further work is warranted to develop common treatment strategies for these fibroproliferative conditions. Characteristics of the normal equine proximal suspensory ligament In this study, N. Werpy and colleagues in the USA and France compared the use of standard ultrasonography, angle contrast ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histology for identification of the anatomic characteristicsof the normal equine suspensory ligament in the forelimb. Horses free from forelimb lameness with no palpable abnormalities in the region of the suspensory ligament wereincluded in this study. The proximal suspensory ligaments in 20forelimbs were examined using the standard ultrasoundtechnique, angle contrast ultrasound technique and MRI, followed by histological evaluation. Total transverse (cross-sectional) area of the proximal suspensory ligament wasestimated using standard ultrasound and angle contrast ultrasound techniques, MRI and histological sections for the following parameters: total area of the ligament, ligamentfibres, muscle and fat. The proximal suspensory ligament lobesize and tissue distribution were compared and subjectivelygraded for asymmetry. Subjectively, angle contrast ultrasoundtechnique improved differentiation of fibres from theremaining tissue types and allowed identification of theperipheral ligament margin. There was no significant difference in asymmetry scores between modalities. The asymmetry scores of the right and left forelimbs weresignificantly different with both ultrasound and MRI, based onthe level of measurement. The angle contrast ultrasoundtechnique has limitations compared to MRI. However, itprovides additional diagnostic information that is not availablewith the standard ultrasound technique. S.

Equine Vet. J. J.M., Comparison between standard ultrasonography, angle contrastultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging characteristicsof the normal proximal collection of equine endocrinology: Recent and future directions; a great start but still a long way to go This month, Equine Veterinary Education and Equine Veterinary Journal have combined forces to create a free online collection of our recent articles on equine endocrinology. Thisinitiative has been made possible with the support of the BritishEquine Veterinary Association Trust, and we are extremelygrateful to Professor Nick Frank and Professor Philip Johnson,who have served as guest editors for this collection. Equine endocrinology is a fast-moving field; in an introductory editorial, Philip Johnson, writing with Professor Sojka-Kritchevsky, reflects on the pace of progress that hasgenerated a vast number of publications in the last decade(Sojka-Kritchevsky and Johnson 2014). The online collectionencompasses a comprehensive range of topics within the fieldof endocrinology and includes authoritative review articles oninsulin dysregulation (Frank metabolic syndrome (Frank and Tadros 2014) are both associated with insulin dysregulation andare now recognised as important and common problems inequine medicine that affect the health and well-being ofmany horses and ponies globally. Both become extremelysignificant due to their link with recurrent laminitis, which raisestheir impact in terms of both morbidity and mortality (Tadrosand Frank 2011). The exact mechanisms that link insulin,glucocorticoids, lipid metabolism and inflammation,endothelial function and the laminae remain to be clarified(Sojka-Kritchevsky and Johnson 2014), but the online collectionhighlights several studies that represent important pieces of thisjigsaw (T\u00f3th al . 2013; Dunkel et al 2014). Current best practice for management of equine metabolic syndrome is outlined by Professors Nick Frank andRay Geor in this month's issue of Equine Veterinary Education (Frank and Geor 2014). The first goal of management is toinduce weight loss, and helpful and explicit guidelines fordesigning diets for obese equids are provided. There is littledoubt that exercise together with dietary management(Hudson et al . 2012) can reduce the clinical signs and indices of inflammation in equine metabolic syndrome (Hudson et al . . 2013; Frank and Geor 2014); however, further studies are needed to quantify the efficacy of thesemanagement changes on long-term outcomes. In cases that are refractory to this approach, metformin (Rendle et al . 2013) or levothyroxine (Frank and Geor 2014) may be helpful. However, questions remain regarding the mosteffective medication, if any, for management of insulindysregulation. It seems reasonable to postulate that removalor control of the underlying causes will be more rational thansimply treating the effects, and it is essential that horse-ownersunderstand that with sufficient effort on their part, equineobesity can be tackled (Owers and Chubbock 2013). The online collection includes several studies addressing the diagnosis of PPID, and in particular, the value of plasmaadrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) when interpreted withseasonally adjusted reference ranges is discussed by several authors (Copas and Durham 2012; al 2014); this is advocated by Professors Frank and Geor as the most readily accessible test for monitoring PPIDcases in a field setting, although the thyroid-releasing hormonestimulation test is more sensitive and therefore has advantagesin confirmation of diagnosis (Frank and Geor 2014). There are some significant problems emerging with the way that horse-owners interpret the information that can be gleaned from screening horses for PPID with the plasma ACTHassay. Perusal of the extremely popular and highly influentialHorse and Hound forum in the UK (http://www.horseandhound .co.uk/forums/) on 21 October 2013 reveals some interestingstrands on this topic. In a query entitled 'Cushings, how highcould a false positive be?' a horse owner outlines her concernas follows: Had vet out for routine stuff the other day and decided to get a mare tested for Cushings purely because it was freeand she is in her 20's. She doesn't show any outward signsof Cushings. The result came back 119. Could this be a falsepositive or a natural spike or is it too high to be false? In reply, another forum user describes some typical clinical signs of PPID, but nevertheless encourages treatment in theabsence of any other clinical evidence of a problem, offeringthe following in response: ACTH levels are naturally higher at this time of year for normal horses but for Cushings horses the levels go quite abit higher. Some horses hardly show any signs of Cushingsand the first sign can be an attack of laminitis. . .when minewas first diagnosed she had a thick coat which didn't [sic]shed properly and fat pads above her eyes and quarters,her level was 172. . .so your [sic] may be at the beginningof Cushings and it may be worth putting her on themedication to control it and then getting her tested againto see if it has made a difference. Unfortunately themedication is quite pricey but you may find she only needsa low dose. Pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction is a neurodegenerative disorder, and current knowledge on itspathogenesis is discussed in detail by Professors Sojka-Kritchevsky and Johnson in their introduction to the onlinecollection published in this month's issue of Equine Veterinary Journal (Sojka-Kritchevsky and Johnson 2014). The odds of developing clinical signs associated with PPID increase byapproximately 20% per year in horses over 15 years of age. Theprevalence of clinical signs in a group of Australian horses was21.5% (McGowan et al . 2013a). The prevalence of clinical signs in horses younger than 15 years of age has not been reportedbut, while there is little doubt that clinical PPID can occur inyounger horses, it seems reasonable to speculate that theprevalence is lower than 20%. The studies on use of plasmaACTH assays for diagnosis of PPID suggest that the sensitivityand specificity are very satisfactory in autumn, but only around80% in other seasons. Studies on the sensitivity and specificity of4 \u00a9 2013 EVJ LtdEQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JANUARY 2014plasma ACTH as a diagnostic test for PPID are hampered by the lack of a readily available 'best' or 'gold standard' test forthe condition. So, where does prevalence come in? Sensitivity and specificity are indicators that relate directly to the test under scrutiny, while for calculation of positive and negative predictive values, prevalence is included in the denominator.In the study by McGowan et al . during autumn the positive predictive value (in other words, the proportion of positive testresults that truly are positive) was only 75%, while in spring,summer and winter the positive predictive value fell to around45% (McGowan et al . 2013b), indicating that 3 of 4 horses with positive test results in autumn were affected, but in the otherseasons, when a 'positive' result was obtained, slightly morehorses did not have the disease than did. The population fromwhich those estimates were derived was restricted to horses 15 years old. The positive and negative predictive values fall as prevalence decreases, and a test useful for diagnosis is notnecessarily appropriate for screening apparently healthypopulations for subclinical disease. Horse-owners areincreasingly aware of PPID and want to screen their horsesbecause the concept of early diagnosis and treatment isattractive. However, studies are urgently required to providethe evidence on which to base screening programmes.Overdiagnosis leads to overtreatment, and treating animalsunnecessarily creates unnecessary concern for their owners aswell as inappropriate financial investment in drug therapy. Inaddition, the risk of untoward effects of drug treatment mustalways be considered; pergolide was removed from themarket for human use in the USA in 2007 because of aperceived increase in the risk of valvular heart disease. Pergolide has emerged as the drug of first choice for treatment of PPID, and it has the advantage that it is licensedfor use in the horse in many regions (Frank and Geor 2014).While the early introduction of medication may avert the spectre of laminitis, clinicians should be aware that, at present, there are no randomised controlled trials comparing pergolidewith alternatives. Furthermore, there have been no long-termstudies to show that horses that are treated with low-dosepergolide before the onset of clinical signs of PPID have betteroutcomes, including a reduced incidence of developinglaminitis, than horses in which treatment is delayed until clinicalsigns become apparent. Perhaps the next decade will providethe evidence base that is needed to provide robust guidelineson this and other medications?

VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JANUARY 2014Editorial Current best practice in clinical management of equineendocrine patients Endocrine disorders are commonly diagnosed in horses and our knowledge of equine endocrinology has expanded in recentyears. Original research reports, case series and review articlesincluded in this virtual issue of Equine Veterinary Education and Equine Veterinary Journal are examples of the work being conducted in this developing area of equine medicine.Pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID) and insulindysregulation (ID) are the most common endocrine disorders encountered in horses and have high prevalence rates. McGowan et al . (2013a) report a prevalence rate of 21.2% for PPID in horses aged 15 years from a cross-sectional survey of horse owners in Queensland, Australia and this is consistent withthe previously reported 22% prevalence rate for haircoatchanges associated with PPID in aged horses in the UnitedKingdom (Ireland et al . 2012). Insulin dysregulation also appears to be common in horses, as a component of equine metabolicsyndrome (EMS) or accompanying PPID (Frank and Tadros2013). Hyperinsulinaemia (fed plasma insulin concentration30 mu/l) occurred with a prevalence of 10% in a cross- sectional study of mixed light-breed horses in Virginia, USA(Pleasant al . 2013) hyperinsulinaemia was detected 32% of ( 15 years) horses with PPID in Queensland (McGowan et al . 2013b). There appears to be a genetic basis to ID, with certain breeds of horse,including ponies, Morgan horses and Arabians beingoverrepresented. Other endocrine disorders of horses includehyperparathyroidism, as discussed by Axiak and Johnson (2012)in their article . 2013). In contrast, some of the common endocrinopathies of humanpatients, dogs and cats such as Addison's disease,hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, are rarely seen in horses.This discussion of best practices in clinical management ofequine endocrine patients focuses on PPID and ID because oftheir high prevalence rates. Before making management decisions, the clinician should first consider the stage of the endocrinopathy and appreciatethe dynamic nature of endocrine disorders. Pituitary parsintermedia dysfunction is a neurodegenerative condition thatprogresses over time and occurs in its advanced form in oldhorses. It is important to recognise, however, that this disorderfirst develops at a younger age and advances in diagnostictesting have allowed us to detect PPID in its earlier stages.Pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction should be considered inhorses aged >10 years that exhibit poor performance, loss of muscle mass and subtle haircoat changes such as retainedhairs in small areas (regional hypertrichosis). Detection of earlyPPID is important because the disorder is easily managed withpergolide treatment and it is advisable to prevent laminitis,rather than wait for this condition to develop. Both PPID and IDare associated with laminitis, and relationships among theseconditions were reviewed by Tadros and Frank (2013) anddiscussed extensively in the Equine Veterinary Journal virtual issue on laminitis (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1001/(ISSN)2042-3306/homepage/laminitis__recent_advances_and_future_directions.htm).Insulin dysregulation can also change over time. If we consider certain horses to be genetically predisposed to thisproblem, the degree of ID is determined by the managementof the horse and development of concurrent medicalconditions. A genetically predisposed horse that is wellmanaged can remain free of health problems whereasobesity, hyperinsulinaemia and laminitis may develop if thesame animal is overfed or exposed to feeds and forages that elicit a marked insulinaemic response. Obesity, regional adiposity, ID, hypertriglyceridaemia and hyperleptinaemia areall components of EMS, a collection of endocrine andmetabolic abnormalities associated with the development oflaminitis in equids. Insulin dysregulation can also beexacerbated by PPID and anecdotal evidence suggests thathorses with EMS are predisposed to PPID. This concern has ledto the recommendation that all horses with EMS that are aged>10 years be closely monitored for signs of pituitary dysfunction. Management and monitoring of PPID Pergolide is recommended for the treatment of PPID inhorses at a dosage of 0.002 mg/kg bwt and is available asPrascend \u00ae1in 1 mg tablets. Anorexia can be encountered as pergolide treatment is initiated, so it is advisable to starthorses on half the dose every other day for 2 doses andthen half the dose daily for 3 days to avoid this complication.Cyproheptadine is also used for the management of PPID, butis reserved for horses with advanced PPID on higher dosages ofpergolide. In these situations cyproheptadine is administeredat a dosage of 0.25 mg/kg bwt orally every 12 h and given toanimals concurrently receiving pergolide. Best practices for managing PPID include measurement of plasma adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) concentrations30 days after pergolide treatment is initiated at the full dose.Plasma ACTH concentrations are also measured to diagnosePPID and this is an easy test to perform because only a singleblood sample is required. The other recommended diagnostictest for PPID is the thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH)stimulation test and this is performed by collecting a bloodsample, injecting 1.0 mg TRH i.v. and collecting a secondblood sample 10 min later. Horses with PPID have a markedincrease in plasma ACTH concentrations in response to TRH.The TRH stimulation test appears to have greater sensitivitythan resting ACTH measurements and is thereforerecommended when clinical signs are subtle and early PPID issuspected. Reference intervals are required when plasma ACTH concentrations are used to diagnose and monitor PPID, andthese intervals must be appropriate for the time of year whenthe horse is tested and assay used. Copas and Durham (2012)established seasonal reference intervals for plasma ACTHconcentrations in horses and reported upper limits of29 pg/ml between November and July and 47 pg/mlbetween August and October for horses in the UK. Seasonallyadjusted reference intervals allow horses to be evaluatedin the late summer and autumn when ACTH concentrations6 \u00a9 2013 EVJ LtdEQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / 2014are higher and melanotrophs within the pars intermedia are more active. Alpha melanocyte-stimulating hormoneconcentrations are also increased with PPID and are affectedby season (McGowan et al . 2013a), but this measure is not offered by laboratories. The August to October period was avoided in the past, but this time of year is now recommended as an appropriate time to assess horses onpergolide treatment. Plasma ACTH concentrations should bemeasured biannually, in the autumn and spring, and thepergolide dosage should be adjusted to maintain plasmaACTH concentrations within reference intervals at both timesof the year. Only the laboratory response to pergolide treatment has been discussed so far and this is the recommended approachwhen managing horses with early PPID that respond well totreatment. However, horses with advanced PPID at the time of first diagnosis often have very high plasma ACTH concentrations, sometimes in excess of 1000 pg/ml. It may notbe possible to return plasma ACTH concentrations to normal inthese cases, so other approaches must be considered. The firstapproach is to adjust the pergolide dosage until a significantdownward shift in ACTH concentrations is detected. Forexample, a downward shift to 250 pg/ml represents asignificant improvement in a horse with a plasma ACTHconcentration of 1000 pg/ml. If the owner can afford toadminister pergolide at higher doses, the dosage should beincrementally increased to try and return plasma ACTHconcentrations to within the reference interval. In the authors'experience, pergolide can be administered to a maximumdosage of 0.01 mg/kg bwt (5 mg for a 500 kg horse) withoutadverse health effects. Although this is the preferredapproach, it is also practical to consider the finances of theowner and select a dosage that elicits a significant downwardshift in plasma ACTH concentration, even if concentrationsremain above reference interval. When discussing prognosis, clinicians can point out that only some of the ACTH produced in horses with advanced PPID is likely to be biologically active,so the laboratory values might be only loosely correlated withclinical signs. In the same example, lowering the ACTHconcentration to 250 pg/ml could therefore be associatedwith a significant improvement in clinical signs. Our secondrecommendation is therefore to monitor clinical responsesto treatment. Outcomes of pergolide treatment includeincreased alertness and activity, resolution of polyuria andpolydipsia, lower incidence of laminitis, improved immunefunction and fewer bacterial infections, mitigation ofhyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinaemia, increased musclemass, and improvements in haircoat quality, hair length andshedding. If a downward shift in ACTH concentrations isdetected and clinical signs improve, owners should beencouraged to continue long-term treatment. Some horsesshow gradual improvement in clinical signs over time, evenwhen receiving pergolide at a dosage suboptimal from alaboratory standpoint. Pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction isa manageable endocrine disorder, even in its advancedstages, and geriatric medicine is a growing field in equinepractice. There are a number of secondary problems encountered in horses with advanced PPID that should be kept in mind. Asmentioned above, polyuria and polydipsia are encountered inhorses with advanced PPID and result from the reduced actionof antidiuretic hormone on the kidney, as described in arecent report by Moses et al . (2013). Hypertriglyceridaemia isalso a concern when horses enter negative energy balance, as occurs with colic, dental disease or systemic illness. Dunkelet al . (2013) describe this problem in their recent retrospective study of hospitalised horses and ponies. Of the 7 animalsidentified and hypertriglyceridaemia triglyceride concentration >5.65 3 horses and 3 ponies were diagnosed with PPID and 5 had concurrent type 2diabetes mellitus. This report and the 3 horses with type 2 diabetes mellitus described by Durham et al . (2009), have raised our awareness of these problems in horses with PPID.Glucose concentrations must be closely monitored in horseswith PPID that encounter stress associated with medicalconditions or hospitalisation, and insulin therapy should beconsidered if hyperglycaemia and hypertriglycerideaemia areencountered. Management and monitoring of insulin dysregulation Insulin dysregulation collectively refers to increased insulin responses to oral sugars, hyperinsulinaemia and insulin resistance, and these problems manifest to different degrees in genetically susceptible horses and ponies. The degree of IDdepends upon modifying factors, including obesity, diet andPPID. Adiposity and tissue insulin sensitivity are negativelycorrelated in horses (Carter et al . 2009), so the first goal of managing ID in an obese horse or pony is to induce weightloss. Exercise should be increased and energy intake restrictedby removing energy-dense feeds such as grain from the dietand limiting pasture access. Obese equids should bemaintained on a diet of hay plus a ration balancer to provideessential nutrients. Amounts of hay can be calculated usingdigestible energy requirements or a simple approach can befollowed in which hay is fed in amounts equivalent to 1.5% ofcurrent bodyweight. If body fat mass does not decrease after4 weeks, the daily amount of hay should be lowered to 1.25%of bodyweight. A further reduction in hay ration to 1.0% ofbodyweight is needed in some cases. Some horses and poniesremain obese on low-energy diets even after exercise isincreased to consume energy; and this is referred to as weightloss resistance (Argo et al . 2012). Levothyroxine sodium can be administered to accelerate weight loss in these animals, butthis approach is only practical in the USA where the drug isinexpensive. Our understanding of the relationships between insulin and laminitis is improving as more research is performed, includingthe 3 studies described in this virtual issue (Venugopal et al . 2011; Burns et al . 2013; Gauff et al . 2013), and these findings emphasise the need for ID to be diagnosed and managed inhorses to prevent laminitis. Two tests are recommended fordiagnosing and monitoring ID: 1) an oral sugar/glucose testand 2) measurement of fasting insulin concentrations. The firsttest evaluates insulinaemic responses to ingested sugars andthe oral sugar test (OST) or in-feed oral glucose test (OGT) canbe performed. The OST is more commonly used in the USAwhere corn syrup is readily available for purchase insupermarkets. When this test is performed, the horse is fastedfrom midnight onwards and corn syrup (0.15 ml/kg bwt) isadministered orally using dose syringes the next morning. Bloodsamples are collected at 60 and 90 min and a high insulinresponse is currently defined by an insulin concentration>60 mu/l at either time point. The OGT is also performed after fasting and the horse is fed 0.5 kg chaff-based feed that \u00a9 2013 EVJ Ltd7 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION 2014contains added dextrose powder (1 g/kg bwt) mixed with water. A blood sample is collecte d 2 h later and an insulin concentration 87 mu/l is a high insulin response. Fasting insulin concentrations can also be measured to test horses for ID. Asingle blood sample is collected after a short fast and fasting hyperinsulinaemia is defined by an insulin concentration >20 mu/l. This test is easy to perform and can be used when owners have concerns about the OST or OGT. However,breed-specific reference intervals are required to improvethe performance of this test and its sensitivity is low, whichraises concern about false negative results in mildly affectedhorses. If it is established from OST or OGT results that insulin responses to ingested sugars are high, a diet should beselected to minimise post prandial hyperinsulinaemia bylimiting the intake of simple sugars and starches, which are rapidly hydrolysed to glucose. Grain and sweet feeds should be fed with caution and the amount of grass consumed onpasture should be limited by restricting the area for grazing orplacing a grazing muzzle on the horse to decrease feedintake. If insulin concentrations markedly increase during theOST, hay with low nonstructural carbohydrate content shouldbe selected and forage analysis is recommended. Hay can besoaked in cold water for 30 min to lower the sugar contentalthough this method does not yield a predictable decrease insugars. Metformin hydrochloride is administered to horses with ID despite its low oral bioavailability (Hustace et al . 2009) and a study performed by Rendle et al . (2013) examines the mechanism of action of this drug in equids. Results indicatethat metformin acts locally at the intestinal level to lower postprandial glucose and insulin concentrations. Only healthyhorses were evaluated in the study, but results support the useof metformin to limit post prandial hyperinsulinaemia in horseswith ID, and current recommendations are to administer metformin at a dosage of 30 mg/kg bwt orally every 8-12 h, with the drug administered 30-60 min before the horse isfed, if possible. The authors reserve metformin treatment forhorses and ponies with markedly increased OST insulinconcentrations, even after loss of body fat mass and dietarymanagement. Insulin dysregulation should be monitored by measuring fasting insulin concentrations (if initially elevated) or repeatingthe OST or OGT. High plasma triglyceride and leptinconcentrations can also accompany ID and obesity, andshould decrease with appropriate management. Adiposity ismonitored through body condition scoring, measuringabdominal circumference at the umbilicus, or neck crestscoring. Pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction exacerbates ID and horses aged >10 years should be closely monitored for the development of this condition. Conclusions Equine endocrine disorders are increasingly recognised andhave become an integral part of wellness evaluations inhorses. Establishing best practices in the diagnosis andmanagement of the 2 common endocrine disorders, PPID andID, will lower the risk of laminitis and improve the healthof horses. Increased awareness of endocrine disorders,including rarer conditions such as diabetes mellitus andhyperparathyroidism, is expanding our knowledge in this areaof veterinary medicine.Authors' declaration of interests Dr Frank is a consultant on study design for BoehringerIngelheim Vetmedica, manufacturer of Prascend \u00ae.

On presentation, a previouslyundiagnosed draining tract was identified at the plantaraspect of the pastern. Radiographs revealed severe osteolysisof the navicular bone. Positive contrast fistulography wasperformed using a gadolinium based contrast agent followingconventional MR imaging of the left hind foot. Fistulographyallowed characterisation of a fistulous tract, which was digital flexor tendon, navicular bursaand osteomyelitis of the navicular bone. History and clinical findings A 7-year-old Quarter Horse gelding was referred for magneticresonance imaging (MRI) of the left hind foot for theinvestigation of intermittent lameness of 3 months' duration.Recurrent subsolar and coronary band abscesses werediagnosed by the referring veterinarian. Treatment prior toreferral included debridement of devitalised tissue fromboth the sole and coronary band, oral administration ofnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication, oral administrationof antibiotics, and administration of antibiotics by regional limbperfusion. At presentation, the horse was grade 4-5 out of 5 lame using the AAEP lameness scale on the left hindlimb (Anon1999). A draining tract not previously reported by the referringveterinarian was identified at the plantar aspect of thepastern. A low 4-point nerve block and a dorsal ring blockperformed proximal to the metatarsophalangeal joint resultedin marked decrease in the degree of lameness. Imaging Radiography Radiography of the left hind foot revealed severe navicularbone osteolysis of the distal half of the the medullary cavity ( Fig 1 ). Moderate concentric soft tissue swelling was evident from the metatarsophalangeal jointto the level of the coronary band. The findings were mostconsistent with infectious osteomyelitis. Magnetic resonance imaging The horse was placed under general anaesthesia using astandard anaesthetic protocol. Magnetic resonance imagingwas performed using a 1.5 T magnet (Echelon) 1with the horsein left lateral recumbency. Sagittal proton density (PD) at 3 slice thickness, T2-weighted fast spin echo (T2W FSE) at4 mm slice thickness, fast inversion recovery 4 mmslice thickness, transverse PD and T2W FSE both at 3 mm slicethickness, and a dorsal PD sequence at 3 mm slice thicknesssequences were acquired from the tip of the foot to themidpoint of the proximal phalanx. A transverse 3D T2*sequence was acquired and reconstructed in 1 mm thickslices in the sagittal plane. The distal aspect of the navicular bone flexor cortex showed a large ill-defined zone of FIR sequences ( 1-2 mm diameter Fig 1: Lateromedial radiograph of foot of left pelvic limb. The distal aspect of the flexor cortex is lytic and irregularly bordered withextension of lysis adjacent medullary region. The distalinterphalangeal joint is dorsally subluxated. The horse was unableto bear full weight on the left pelvic limb during acquisition of thisimage.10 \u00a9 2013 EVJ LtdEQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JANUARY 2014hypointense structures were present within the region of the abnormal hyperintense signal at the distal and lateral flexorsurface of bone. The by aregion T2W and FIR mixed signal intensity, which wasprimarily hyperintense. The dorsal aspect of the deep digitalflexor tendon (DDFT) at the level of the navicular bone wassubjectively thin, most severe in the medial lobe. A T2W, PDand T2* ofthe DDFT, more severe in the and T2* DDFT was more extensive compared with T2W sequences andextended full thickness through the medial lobe of the tendonand partial thickness through the lateral lobe. The navicularbursa was poorly visualised on all sequences. Within the plantar aspect of the pastern, the soft tissues dorsal to the digital cushion showed a faint PD isointense andwell defined T2W and FIR hyperintense tract on sagittalimages. However, the course of this tract was faintly visible asit approached the DDFT and the dorsal extent of the tractcould not be on either or flexor tendonitis and afistula of the left hind foot were made. To determine ifcommunication existed between the fistulous tract andcomponents of the podotrochlear apparatus, fistulographywas performed. Immediately following initial image acquisition, the surface coil was removed and the left hind pastern region wasaseptically prepared. A sterile stainless steel probewas placed temporarily into the fistulous tract so that 6 ml of1% Gd-DPTA (Magnevist) 2could introduced. Sagittal T1W FIR Fig 2: Mid-sagittal FIR and 3D GRE T2* images of the left hind foot. The FIR image was acquired with 4 mm slice thickness and the GRE reconstructed with 1 mm thickness. The distal sesamoidean impar ligament is severely thickened and has increased signal intensityon both sequences (arrowhead). The hypointense signal from the flexor cortical bone is absent (*) and there is increased FIRsignal intensity within the navicular bone medullary cavity. The DDFT is thinned with irregular borders (long arrow). A faint FIR hyperintensetract is visible within the plantar soft tissues, proximal to the digital cushion and progresses towards the podotrochlear apparatus (shortarrows). 3D T2* Fig 3: Transverse 3D GRE T2* image at the level of the mid middlephalanx, just proximal to the proximal recess of the navicularbursa. Medial is to the left. There are biaxial dorsal borderhyperintensities of the DDFT (arrows), which were also observed infurther distal images (not shown), extending to the level of proximalaspect of the distal phalanx. Additionally, the dorsal border ofthe DDFT is irregular and poorly delineated. Further proximal to thisimage, the signal intensity was andsymmetrical. \u00a9 2013 EVJ Ltd11EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION AE JANUARY 2014FSE 4 mm thick and dorsal and transverse 3 mm thick images were acquired. Hyperintense contrast agent confirmed thelocation of the fistulous tract from the plantar aspect of thepastern, which coursed through the mid-sagittal digitalcushion, and diverted laterally around the DDFT to end thelateral aspect of the proximal navicular bursa recess ( Fig navicular bone necrosis,and navicular due to a fistulous tract at the pastern wasconfirmed. Surgery and outcome Following MRI, navicular bursoscopy was unsuccessfullyattempted due to loss of structural integrity of the bursa (Wrightet al . 1999). For this reason an alternative approach through the sole of the frog was used to access the podotrochlearapparatus (F\u00fcrst and Lischer 2006). Goals of surgery weredebridement navicular bone and therapeutic lavage ofthe navicular bursa. Surgical findings included soft andnecrotic bone at the flexor surface of the navicular bone,which extended into the medullary cavity. The navicular bursawas unidentifiable surgically. Following surgery, the horse failedto show improvement despite aggressive systemic andregional antibiotic therapy, aggressive multi-modal painmanagement, anti-inflammatory therapy and supportive careto prevent support limb laminitis. During a second surgery,deep digital flexor tenotomy was performed in an attempt tomanage pain by minimising pressure applied to the navicularbone by the DDFT (Hunt et al . 1991). Due to failure to respond to therapy, the owner declined further treatment and the horse was discharged foreuthanasia by the referring veterinarian. No necropsy wasperformed. The case described in this study was treatedaccording to current veterinary ethical and professional guidelines as described by Anon (2012). Discussion Magnetic resonance fistulography allowed the causeof lysis of the navicular bone, focal DDFT lesions anddestruction of the navicular bursa to be linked to a fistuloustract. In this study, a gadolinium based paramagnetic contrastagent was used that has the effect of decreasing T1 relaxationtime which results in increased signal produced during a T1weighted sequence (McRobbie 2007). One report of equineMRI fistulography is available and only describes the use ofiodinated contrast that remained present followingradiographic fistulography (Kinns and Mair 2005). Anotherstudy reported the use of 3D GRE T1 weighted imaging todiagnose experimentally created thoracic duct interstitium (Staatz et al . 2003). We found a similar improved ability to identify the fistula following contrastadministration in our study using a 3D T1W GRE sequence.Magnetic resonance fistulography has been described morecommonly al . 2011). Post contrast T2W GRE, and to a lesser extent precontrast STIRsequences, provided the greatest ability to identify perianalfistulous tracts using gadolinium enhanced fistulography withMRI (Sabir et al . 2000). Post contrast T1W sequences were less effective at highlighting fistulous tracts due to the inability to distinguish hyperintense Gd-DTPA from hyperintense perinealfat (Sabir et al . 2000). This differed from our findings where T1W images following administration of Gd-DTPA allowed forexcellent contrast with the relatively hypointense digital Fig Post fistulography sagittal and transverse T1W images. The fistulous tract (arrows) is observed clearly traversing the plantar soft tissues, tracking to the level of the DDFT, redirecting laterally and then dorsally to the level of the proximal border of the navicular bone andnavicular bursa. Multifocal foci of signal void are located within the centre of the fistulous tract, probably representing air that wasintroduced iatrogenically during contrast administration. The full extent of the fistulous tract was not evident on precontrast images. \u00a9 2013 EVJ Ltd12EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JANUARY 2014cushion and surrounding plantar soft tissue structures. This difference from human perianal MRI fistulography can beexplained by a difference in regional tissue composition, withthe digital cushion containing collagenous and elastic fibreswith minimal fat and cartilage (Dyce et al . 2010). Even though it was unable to be confirmed in this case, penetrating solar trauma is reported as a cause for septicnavicular bursitis in mature horses (Honnas 1992). Injuries from penetrating foreign objects in the foot often result in a hypointense tract with MRI that persists for weeks following theinitial injury, which would not be possible to diagnose withradiography unless osseous changes develop (Kinns and Mair2005). T1W and T2W hypointensity of tracts is explained inacute stages as a signal void due to air, and in chronic stagesas a result of mineralisation or haemosiderin (Kinns and Mair2005; Murray et al . 2006). Similar findings at the distal flexor surface of the navicular bone were present in the current case. Penetrating foot trauma is less common than other typesof foot injury in the horse and was identified in 5 of 347 horsesexamined for foot pain using MRI that also exhibitedhypointensity in the palmar soft tissues (Dyson and Murray2007). Penetrating foot trauma is often identified inconjunction with injury to other soft tissue structures such as theDDFT, navicular bursa, distal 2005; Kinns and Mair 2005; Dyson and Murray 2007). Magnetic resonance imaging has been shownto be an excellent modality for diagnosing penetrating footinjury in the horse (Boado et al . 2005; Kinns and Mair 2005). Radiographic fistulography is the traditional method for defining fistulous tracts in the equine digit or other anatomysecondary to penetrating trauma and to improveidentification of foreign bodies (Barber 1983). Its usage hasbeen described and shown to aid in determination ofsoft tissue involvement, communication with synovial structuresand communication with bone in horses (Lamb 1991).Computed tomographic fistulography has also beendescribed in veterinary and human literature anddemonstrates improved identification of fistulous tracts, foreignbodies and diagnosis compared al . 2003; Johnson-Neitman et al . 2006). Magnetic resonance imaging was indicated based onthe history of chronic foot pain and the need for evaluation ofthe soft tissue structures in the foot for determination ofprognosis and potential surgical approach (Dyson et al . 2005). During initial acquisition, the course of the draining tract couldnot be determined with standard MRI sequences. Therefore,it was decided to add a fistulography to gain more informationfor prognosis and surgical approach. Superimposition andpoor soft tissue resolution of a radiographic contrastfistulography compared to MRI would have limited the abilityto determine the course of the draining tract and itsrelationship with soft tissue structures within the foot and wouldhave prolonged anaesthesia time. Magnetic resonance bursography may have provided further evidence of communication with the fistuloustract and the navicular bursa or information regardingthe integrity of the bursa. Since the time of the initialexamination of the horse in this report, 2 reports describingcontrast navicular bursography in the horse have beenpublished. One cadaver study reports that administration ofsaline into the navicular bursa allowed for separationof the dorsal border of the DDFT and the palmar border of thenavicular bone, which improved evaluation of navicularfibrocartilage (Schramme et al . 2009). Another study describes improved identification of adhesions between the navicularbursa and DDFT using MRI following bursal distension withiodinated contrast agent (Maher et al . 2011). Had bursography been used in the case described here, the fullestextent of navicular bursal involvement may have beenappreciated. We attempted navicular bursoscopy in ourpatient but were unable to enter the bursa or visualise any normal bursal tissue. This is probably due to the destruction of the navicular bursa by a suspected septic process and mayhave prevented our ability to perform MRI bursography had itbeen attempted. This report describes the use of gadolinium contrast agent to improve the identification of a fistulous tract inthe foot of a horse. Portions of the fistulous tract could beidentified prior to fistulography, especially with T2W FSE sequences, but the location and full extent were only evident in T1W post contrast images and confirmed the extremelyclose association with the navicular bone, DDFT and navicularbursa lesions. Magnetic resonance fistulography was ideal forthe simultaneous description of the soft tissue pathology anddefinition of the fistulous tract with the use of one imagingmodality.

Animal Safety: Client should be advised to observe for signs of potential drug toxicity and be given a Client Information Sheet with each prescription. For technical assistance or to report suspected adverse events, call 1-877- 217-3543. Precautions: Horses should undergo a thorough history and physical examina- tion before initiation of NSAID therapy. Appropriate laboratory tests should be conducted to establish hematological and se rum biochemical baseline data before and periodically during administration of any NSAID. Clients should be advised to observe for signs of potential drug toxicity and be given a Client Information Sheet with each prescription. See Information for Owner or Person Treating Horse section of this package insert. Treatment with EQUIOXX \u00ae should be terminated if signs such as inappetence, colic, abnormal feces, or lethargy are observed. As a class, cyclooxygenase inhibitory NSAIDs may be associated with renal and gastrointestinal toxicity. Sensitivity to drug-associated adverse events varies with the individual patient. Patients at greatest risk for adverse events are those that are dehydrated, on diuretic therapy, or those with existing renal, cardiovascular, and/or hepatic dysfunction. Concurrent administration of potentially nephrotoxic drugs should be carefully approached or avoided. NSAIDs may inhibit the prostaglandins that maintain normal homeostatic function. Such anti-prostaglandin effects may result in clinically significant disease in patients with underlying or pre-existing disease that has not been previously diagnosed. Since many NSAIDs possess the potential to produce gastrointestinal ulcerations, concomitant use with other anti-inflammatory drugs, such as NSAIDs or corticosteroids, should be avoided or closely monitored. The concomitant use of protein bound drugs with EQUIOXX \u00ae Oral Paste has not been studied in horses. The influence of concomitant drugs that may inhibit the metabolism of EQUIOXX\u00ae Oral Paste has not been evaluated. Drug compatibility should be monitored in patients requiring adjunctive therapy. The safe use of EQUIOXX \u00ae Oral Paste in horses less than one year in age, horses used for breeding, or in pregnant or lactating mares has not been evaluated. Consider appropriate washout times when switching from one NSAID to another NSAID or corticosteroid. Adverse Reactions: In controlled field studies, 127 horses (ages 3 to 37 years) were evaluated for safety when given EQUIOXX\u00ae Oral Paste at a dose of 0.045 mg/lb (0.1 mg/kg) orally once daily for up to 14 days. The following adverse reactions were observed. Horses may have experienced more than one of the observed adverse reactions during the study. EQUIOXX \u00ae (firocoxib) Oral Paste was safely used concomitantly with other therapies, including vaccines, anthelmintics, and antibiotics, during the field studies. Information for Owner or Person Treating Horse: You should give the Client Information Sheet to the person treating the horse and advise them of the potential for adverse reactions and the clinical signs associated with NSAID intolerance. Adverse reactions may include erosions and ulcers of the gums, tongue, lips and face, weight loss, colic, diarrhea, or icterus. Serious adverse reactions associated with this drug class can occur without warning and, in rare situations, result in death. Clients should be advised to discontinue NSAID therapy and contact their veterinarian immediately if any of these signs of intolerance are observed. The majority of patients with drug-related adverse reactions recover when the signs are recognized, drug administration is stopped, and veterinary care is initiated. Effectiveness: Two hundred fifty-three client-owned horses of various breeds, ranging in age from 2 to 37 years and weighing from 595 to 1638 lbs, were randomly administered EQUIOXX or an active control drug in multi-center field studies. Two hundred forty horses were evaluated for effectiveness and 252 horses were evaluated for safety. Horses were assessed for lameness, pain on manipulation, range of motion, joint sw elling, and overall clinical improvement in a non-inferiority evaluation of EQUIOXX compared to an active control. At study's end, 84. 4% of horses treated with EQUIOXX were judged improved on veterinarians' clinical assessment, and 73.8% were also rated improved by owners. Horses treated with EQUIOXX showed improvement in veterinarian-assessed lameness, pain on manipulation, range of motion, and joint swelling that was comparable to the active control.

Standing equine MRI machines are becoming the new norm in helping equine veterinarians diagnose lameness problems. Hallmarq Veterinary Imaging's standing MRI machine allows horses to stand for scans of the foot and lower leg. The horse is simply walked into the machine instead of undergoing general anesthesia, which can lead to problems including death in some healthy horses. The new motion correction technology offers quality diagnostic images while providing a safe and comfortable experience for the horse.

Werpy Diagnostic Imaging Department, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA. Corresponding author email: werpyn@ufl.edu The case presented in this issue by Garcia et al . (2014) demonstrates the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) positive contrast fistulography in a horse with a penetrating foot wound and associated osseous and soft tissue injury.Based on the history, and clinical and imaging examinations,infectious osteomyelitis was strongly suspected. Radiographsdemonstrated evidence of osteolysis of the navicular bone,but further imaging was needed to confirm this finding andevaluate the soft tissues (Urraca Del Junco et al . 2012). The soft tissue detail and exquisite fluid sensitivity make MRI themodality of choice when evaluating a penetrating woundand particularly when extension to the osseous column issuspected ( Fig 1 ). No other modality has the ability to define the extent or involvement of associated structures with thesame accuracy. Differentiating septic conditions such as osteomyelitis from regional inflammation or trauma is difficult to impossiblewithout the identification of bone lysis regardless of theimaging modality. The clinical history and examination iscritical for accurate interpretation of the imaging findings.However, there can be significant overlap between horses presenting with infection vs. inflammation. These cases are challenging, and often require additional diagnosticimaging to aid in the differentiation between infection andinflammation. This can be most difficult when attemptingto differentiate joint sepsis with periarticular/subchondralosteomyelitis from a joint flare with osseous inflammation. This isbecause the same overlap in these cases that can occur withthe clinical presentation can also occur with imaging findings. One of the earliest pathological changes in the development of osteomyelitis is osseous fluid accumulationand MRI is the only imaging modality that can be used for itsidentification (Yang et al . 2006; Jaramillo earliest canbe identified using skeletal nuclear scintigraphy. However, thismodality is dependent on the presence of actual boneturnover and not specifically the presence of osseous fluid. Forthis reason, nuclear scintigraphy is sensitive for early bone injurybut not specific et al . 2012). Fat suppressed and fluid sensitive MRI sequences, such as the STIR sequence, are mostfrequently used to identify fluid in bone. While normal bone isrelatively homogenous dark grey to black on images acquiredusing the STIR sequence, fluid in bone is detected as regions ofincreased signal intensity and the affected area appears greyto white. The degree of hyperintensity (dark grey, light grey orwhite) is based on the severity of the fluid accumulation andthe fluid composition. Pure fluid will appear a different shadeof grey to fluid with cells and/or protein, depending on the MRIsequence. Although fat suppressed sequences are mostcommonly used for the identification of osseous fluid and are generally most sensitive, other MRI sequences can also beutilised. All MRI sequences should be compared as thedifferent sequences provide different pieces of information(Werpy and Barrett 2012). The diagnostic imaging challenge in these cases is that the signal patterns for these conditions, joint sepsis vs. joint flare,are not specific, and at different stages and severities therecan be marked similarities in the appearance of the MRIimages (Kuemmerle et al . 2006). The interpretation of the images must utilise all of the available signs including theassociated or adjacent synovial and soft tissue structures. Jointcapsule inflammation and synovitis, as well as soft tissueswelling are important indicators, as they are often moreprominent with sepsis (Yang et al . 2006; Jaramillo 2011; Guillerman 2013). Although the imaging modality of MRI is uniquely sensitive to the identification of osseous fluid, the fluid can also bea nonspecific finding ( Fig 2 ). Fluid is seen in cases with osteomyelitis, osteonecrosis, resorption, inflammation,limb overuse 1996; Grampp et al . 1998). It is important to understand Fig 1: A penetrating wound is present, evidenced by a tract containing haemorrhage (arrow). The tract extends from the solethrough the digital cushion into the proximal recess of the navicularbursa (asterisk). Magnetic resonance imaging provides anexcellent method for determining the extent of abnormalitiesresulting from a penetrating wound.15 \u00a9 2013 EVJ LtdEQUINE VETERINARY / AE / JANUARY 2014that osseous fluid from osteomyelitis can appear as the same shade of grey as fluid from inflammation or trauma. The shadeof grey in the region of fluid, which is determined by theseverity and the composition of the fluid, is an important factorin ranking the differential diagnoses for these cases in conjunction with the clinical presentation. In order to differentiate the aetiology of the fluid accumulation better, i.v.administration of gadolinium can be considered (Morrisonet al . 1993). The synovial membrane is expected to have marked contrast enhancement in sepsis. However, this canalso be difficult to differentiate from severe inflammation andenhancement is considered a nonspecific finding (Ledermannet al . 2002; Averill et al . 2009). Lysis is the most definitive diagnostic imaging abnormality that can lead to a confident diagnosis of osteomyelitis (Pinedaet al . 2006). In the earliest stages of osteomyelitis, lysis may not be initially visible, and then becomes visible on subsequentstudies. The cross sectional nature of MRI makes it very sensitiveto the progression of bone lysis that can occasionally occur very rapidly, resulting in significant lysis in 1-2 weeks that was not present on the initial study. The use of standing, sedatedMRI is particularly useful in this situation for frequent recheck examinations when attempting to monitor treatment and disease progression. In certain cases, it will not be possible todiagnose osteomyelitis using only one MR examination and asecond may be necessary to evaluate the affected structures(Werpy 2012). In the case of a penetrating wound, bone loss as a result of osteomyelitis is a great concern. However, it is important tonote that bone loss can occur without infection. Trauma to thebone by the penetrating object can result in osteonecrosis orresorption. In these cases the MRI images and radiographsshould be evaluated together as the fine bone detail can bebetter assessed on radiographs when it is in a visible location.Regardless of these assessments, when in doubt these casesshould be treated like sepsis with osteomyelitis until provenotherwise (Jann and Pasquini 2005; Murray 2012). Typically,even in the absence of infection, there is initially significantinflammation in the bone recognised on MR images by thepresence of fluid. Trauma and/or joint flares can result inenough inflammation to see abnormalities develop in thearticular cartilage and the periarticular margins. The lack ofinfection in cases with severe inflammation does not decreasein importance of this relative to the long-term health of thejoint. The case presented in this issue by Garcia et al . (2014) demonstrates the use of positive contrast fistulography in ahorse with a suspected penetrating wound. Clear signs ofosteomyelitis were present in this case. However, it is importantto remember that the distinction between infection andinflammation can be difficult even with MRI and may requiremore than one imaging study.

Tessier and G. Touzot-Jourde Surgery Department, Equine Clinic, ONIRIS, Nantes-Atlantique, National College of Veterinary Medicine, Food Nantes, France.*Corresponding Report describes a 5-year-old Standardbred gelding that was referred to the Equine Hospital of ONIRIS Veterinary School of Nantes, France for a surgical procedure under general anaesthesia. Anaesthesia was induced andmaintained intravenously and the horse was placed in leftlateral recumbency with a padded halter. On post operativeDay 1, a post anaesthetic distal facial nerve branch paresiswas diagnosed based on clinical signs. The horse wasdischarged on post operative Day 2 with medical treatmentbased on anti-inflammatory drug administration locally andsystemically. The horse was re-examined 2 weeks after thesurgery; the left partial facial paralysis was still present andassociated with amyotrophy of the muscles supplied by thebuccal branches of the facial nerve. In accordance with theowner, the horse was hospitalised to start an electrostimulationtreatment. The horse was treated every day for the first 4 days,then every 2 or 3 days during the following 3 weeks, for a totalof 11 sessions. At the end of the second week of treatment,the horse was able to normally prehend the food andatrophy seemed reduced. The horse was discharged fromhospitalisation at the end of the third week of treatment withspecific recommendations. One month after discharge fromthe hospital just a slight asymmetry could be noticed at rest. Sixmonths later, the training season began and the horse wasable to perform. Facial paralysis due to nerve compression is awell-known complication of anaesthesia. Gradual recovery offunction over the weeks of treatment suggests thatelectroacupuncture may promote recovery and may hastentime of recovery. Introduction Facial nerve paralysis has been identified in several domesticspecies (DeLahunta and Glass 2009). The most common causein horses is a facial nerve traumatic injury, which can be aconsequence of direct trauma to the nerve or a result of localinflammatory changes involving the nerve (Sumano et al . 1997; Rose and Hodgson 2000). It may improve over days, weeks or months without treatment, but can also persist formonths to years and lead to inability to perform (Jeong et al . 2001; Smith and George 2009). In man, there is some evidenceto support acupuncture as a treatment for facial paralysis(Dong and Xie 2002; Mayor 2007). Electroacupuncture hasbeen regarded as a therapeutic option for various muscularand neurological conditions and may also be able to facilitatethe treatment of facial paralysis in horses (Sumano et al . 1997; Fleming 2001; Kim and Xie 2009). Electroacupuncture 3 (NT-3) and levelof cyclic adenosine monophosphate in injured spinal cord tissue (Ding et al . 2009). Neurotrophine 3 plays an important role in nervous system development, neuronal survival and differentiation, and neural repair. Elevated NT-3 expression canimprove the microenvironment of injured spinal cord (Yanet al . 2011). In addition, a previous study reported that electroacupuncture treatment can prevent the formation of aglial scar after spinal cord injury (Yang et al . 2005). More interestingly, regarding functional peripheral nerveregeneration it has been shown that electroacupuncture exerts a positive influence on motor recovery and reduced pain related behaviour in mice after sciatic nerve crush injury(Hoang et al . 2012). This clinical case reports the use of electrostimulation in the treatment of traumatic partial facialnerve palsy following a surgery under general anaesthesia in ahorse. Case history A 5-year-old Standardbred gelding was referred for to the Equine Hospitalof ONIRIS Veterinary School of Nantes, France. The surgery wasperformed under general anaesthesia with the horse placedin left lateral recumbency in a padded recovery box.Anaesthesia was 0.08 5%, ketamine 1 g/l, romifidine0.05 g/l). The surgical site was accessed by the oral cavity andthe procedure was performed under endoscopic guidance.No intraoperative complications were encountered. Theprocedure lasted 18 min and the total recumbency durationlasted 60 min. During the procedure, a padded halter waskept on the horse in order to mobilise the head easily and wasleft during recovery. Clinical findings and diagnosis On post operative Day 1, the horse presented a markedmuzzle deviation towards the right side, the left nostril wascollapsed and sagging inwards during inspiration. The lower lipon the left side hung loosely from its attachment and the horsehad difficulty prehending food. The left eyelid and the left eardid not show any weakness. Additionally, swelling was presenton the left lateral aspect of the masseter at the level of thefacial nerve buccal branches. A traumatic distal facial nervebranch paresis was diagnosed based on clinical signs ( Fig 1 ). The initial treatment was comprised of a single i.v.administration dexamethasone (Dexadreson) 4at / AE / JANUARY 2014bwt and local application twice a day of a topical gel containing dimethyl sulfoxide and prednisolone. The horse was discharged on post operative Day 2. The owner was instructed to administer a 5-day course of phenylbutazone (Equipalazone)4at 2.2 mg/kg bwt per os s.i.d., to rest the horsefor 2 weeks (1 week of box rest and 1 week in the paddock), and to return for follow-up. The horse was re-examined 2 weeks after the surgery for a post operative evaluation of the upper airway and the facial paralysis. The left partial facial paralysis was still present and a a) b) Fig 1a) and b): The horse with distal facial nerve palsy associated with a marked muzzle deviation towards the right side and the lower lip on the left side hung loosely.

Food impaction in the left cheek and drooling on the left side of thelips had worsened. Cranial nerve testing did not reveal any additional abnormalities apart from the left distal facial nerve.Muscle tone and movements of the left eyelid and the left earwere deemed normal. Endoscopic examination of the upperairway including the left guttural pouch did not show any abnormality and confirmed the resolution of the epiglotticentrapment with normal healing at the surgical site. Treatment Due to a lack of spontaneous recovery of the paresis and theidentification of muscle atrophy, the horse was hospitalised tostart an electrostimulation treatment. The acupuncture points were selected in accordance to veterinary literature and adapted to the course of the facial nerve on this horse (Fleming 2001; Jeong et al . 2001; Mayor 2007). The electroacupuncture unit used was an IC-1107 + 5 (Fig 3 ) that has 3 output channels device, an adjustable frequency 0-500 Hz, an asymmetric biphasic pulse shape witha phase duration of 100 ms on low voltage (0-10 V) and a low current amplitude (0-20 mA). Needles (Serein 0.25 \u00a540 mm) 6 used were single-use, sterile, silicon coated individually packaged acupuncture needles. They were inserted just under the skin or directly into the muscle. Needles wereattached by lead clip to the electroacupuncture unit. The thinness of the skin facilitated the palpation of the buccal branches. For the first 3 sessions, the acupoints TH17, ST4, 6 and7 were used bilaterally ( Table 1 ). Extra needles were inserted subcutaneously along the dorsal and the ventral buccal branches on the left side and intramuscular needles were inserted in the levator 4 ). In the following sessions, TH17 and ST7 were treated bilaterally. Two or 3 points along each buccal branch were selected on only the left side. Three leads were used for the electrostimulation (ITO ES-130): one lead on each facial buccal branch and one lead in themuscle (alternating every 5 min between the first 3 treatments. Once nerve conductionhad fully returned (Treatment 4), stimulation of each buccal branch was used to elicit muscle contractions of the nostril, upper and lower lips ( Fig 4 ). Electrostimulation lasted 20 min with alternating frequencies every 5 min between 5 and 200 Hz with a low current intensity. A frequency of 1.5 Hz wasused for repeated muscle contractions for periods of 2-3 min 3 times during the treatment. Each treatment from the fourth session onward included a few short provoked tetaniccontractions (1-2 s, <10 in a row) of the nostril-upper lip and the lower lip by stimulation of each branch. Needle insertion was always very well tolerated as well as low intensity electrostimulation. Induced tetanic contractions elicited alarge head movement during the first applications but slowly increasing the intensity of stimulation resolved the initially observed discomfort. The horse was treated every day for thefirst 4 days, then every 2 or 3 days during the following 3 weeks,for a total of 11 sessions. During the second week, physical therapy was used in conjunction with the acupuncturetherapy; presenting hay to the left side of the mouth at least 3times a day to stimulate active mobilisation of the left side of the lips for 10 min and daily grazing in the paddock facilitatedmobilisation of the affected muscle ( Table 2 ). Outcome After the 4 first treatments, the horse exhibited an improved ability to drink and feed with less cheek impaction and reduced drooling at the left commissure. Weak spontaneous movements of the upper lip were noticed at the end of the firstweek and facial asymmetry diminished progressively over the3-week course of treatment. At the end of the second week oftreatment, the horse was able to normally prehend the food with his left side of the lips. Atrophy seemed reduced and thefood impaction had disappeared. The horse was dischargedfrom hospitalisation at the end of the third week with instruction to keep promoting food prehension on the left sideof his lips twice daily for one month. One month afterdischarge from the hospital, a slight asymmetry could be noticed at rest but disappeared while the horse was mobilisinghis lips. The horse's training season began 6 months after the treatment and no exercise intolerance was observed. Furthermore, the left nostril appeared to dilate normally at exercise. Discussion In horses, traumatic facial paralysis is a well-known complication of abnormal pressure applied to the face over the track of the facial nerve. Predisposing factors include Fig 3: The electroacupuncture unit, IC-1107 +. \u00a9 2013 EVJ Ltd20EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JANUARY 2014anatomic features in the horse, such as the nerve passing over prominent facial bony structures (rim of the ramusmandibulae, supraorbital ridge) and nerve location in thin subcutaneous tissue as well as prolonged periods of completelateral recumbency on hard surfaces or wearing a halter withlarge buckles and thick leather or fabric (DeLahunta and Glass2009; Smith and George 2009). Despite padding precautions and a short duration of recumbency, facial paralysisdeveloped in this horse and was probably a result of keeping a large, thick and insufficiently padded halter on the head. The World Health Organisation has included Bell's palsy in its list of diseases for which acupuncture therapy is indicatedand a wide variety of human facial paralyses are commonlytreated by acupuncture and electroacupuncture (Dong and Xie 2002; Mayor 2007). Point selection based on traditional acupoints has been shown to be more effective when it is adapted to the anatomical distribution of the facial nerve branches and anatomical location of muscles targeted forstimulation (Fleming 2001; Jeong et al . 2001; Mayor 2007). In the treatment of various problems including paralysis, electroacupuncture, as compared to simple needling, hasbeen shown to allow for more rapid, more intense and longerlasting results (Mayor 2007). While experimental data have supported the benefit of electrical nerve stimulation for axonalregeneration following nerve trauma (Shi et al . 2000), direct stimulation of denervated muscles has been a subject of controversy. Excessive stimulation and movement of muscles with reduced circulation is thought to increase fibrosis and delay nerve regrowth and reconnection to muscles (Mayor2007). However, electrical stimulation by its beneficial effectson microcirculation and inflammation can improve tissuenourishment and healing as well as delay atrophy and fibrosis.Selection of electrical parameters based on intrinsic firing characteristics of motor units themselves like in trophic electrical stimulation (low frequencies and amplitudes) appears to be less fatiguing and more able to maintain muscletone by altering metabolism rather than muscle fibre training (Mayor 2007). Low frequency and low intensity stimulation for short periods of time were therefore initially used to obtainweak contractions of atrophied muscle in this horse. Once nerve conduction had been regained, alternating high and low frequency stimulation at low amplitude was used as it hasbeen shown to be more efficacious than a continuous stimulation at a set frequency (Mayor 2007). This constitutes adifference with the stimulation mode used by Sumano in his 12clinical cases. When the injury is mild, clinical signs often disappear in a few days/weeks and it is thought that no nerve degenerationoccurs, only interruption of nerve conduction (neuropraxia).The myelin sheath is temporarily damaged causing a focal demyelination and a partial denervation of the muscles, whichcan still be excited by stimulation of the motor nerve (Mayor2007). If the lesion is more severe (neurotmesis), a complete denervation leads to muscle degeneration and fibrosis startingwithin 1-2 weeks of the nerve injury and is completed in about3 years. In this sort of clinical case, the muscle fibres need to bedirectly stimulated to contract. The severity of the lesion wasnot clearly established; however, absence of spontaneousTABLE 1: Description of acupuncture points used Point, Chinese name Meridian Location area ST4, Di Cang Stomach meridian Caudal to the corner of the mouth, at the 'V' junction of the levator nasolabialis m. and zygomaticus m., on the outer margin of the orbicularis muscle.

Rapid recovery of nerve conduction as identifiedby muscle contraction elicited by stimulation of the nerve onthe third treatment probably indicates a less severe lesion thaninitially assessed. Electroacupuncture treatment is believed tohave been beneficial in this case as observed by the recoveryand improvement of clinical signs over time. No improvementwas seen during the first 2 weeks with the initial medicaltreatment and facial muscle atrophy had begun. Gradualrecovery of function over the 3-week electroacupuncturecourse suggests that it is a favourable treatment. Sumano et al . (1997) reported successful outcomes with a similar treatmentcourse: first stimulation within the 10 days (2 weeks for this case)following paralysis onset with a mean of 13 (7-17) treatmentsdone every other day over a course of 3-4 weeks (11 sessionsover 3 weeks for the present case). Progressive improvementswere seen over the course of the treatment and very visibleafter the first or second treatment as in the presentcase. Although the factors involved in the decision oftreatment termination are not clearly stated, ownersatisfaction seemed to have played an important role.Follow-up at 6 months showed no recurrence of clinical signs inboth case reports. Rehabilitation exercises were added to theelectroacupuncture for the present case during the secondweek of treatment and likely also played a role in recovery.Human and experimental data show that there areadvantages in combining electrotherapy and physiotherapy(Angelov et al . 2007; Mayor 2007). Conclusions Distal facial paralysis in the horse as described in the present case affects food prehension ability and nostril dilation. It canresult in dysphagia and inability to perform. Spontaneousrecovery can be long and incomplete, jeopardisingan athletic career. The use of electrotherapy seemsadvantageous in promoting recovery and may hasten time ofrecovery. However, as the amount of nerve injury was notassessed before treatment and a multimodal therapeuticapproach was used, it is not possible to determine which partof the treatment was the most efficacious, although the treatment success was assumed to be due to the combinedtherapy (electroacupuncture and physical therapy) afterinitial medical treatment failed. Finally, it is important to keep inmind that facial paralysis might occur even after a short lateralrecumbency and halters should be always removed whenpossible. Discussion about appropriate positioning andpadding to avoid nerve lesion is the primary way to avoidfacial paralysis in horses undergoing general anaesthesia.

Agro Star Agro Star Grand Prix Show Jumping HorseClinical Commentary Electroacupuncture for nerve injury in the horse D. G. von Schweinitz Orchard Paddocks, Iron Lane, Surrey, nerve regeneration The case report from de Fourmestraux et al . (2014) describes the use of electroacupuncture (EA) in the treatment of a facialnerve paralysis occurring as a post anaesthetic complicationin a horse. It was applied in addition to conventional treatmentin an effort to maximise the chances of recovery of nervefunction. Nerve trauma with varying degrees of nerve deficitand associated pain are not uncommon in the horse. There are many indications and opportunities for EA to improve the outcome of injuries involving nerve damage, and there is goodevidence from clinical and experimental trials in other speciesin the use of EA for these cases. A recent review of the EA literature through PubMed gives an account of the breadth of research in this area from 1975 to2012 (Mayor 2013). This found 548 clinical studies of EA in manand 1607 predominantly experimental animal studies. Thesewere mainly pain studies investigating endogenous opioidmechanisms. More recently, nonpain studies dominate. Thefindings support the upregulation of -endorphins occurring in the brain from low frequency EA (1-7 Hz) and the upregulationof dynorphin in occurring from high frequencyEA (15-100 Hz). Electroacupuncture delivers a stronger dose ofacupuncture, more effectively upregulates the endogenousopioid mechanisms, and is more easily standardised forresearch purposes than manual acupuncture. Peripheral nerve injuries result in partial or total loss of motor, sensory, and autonomic functions in the denervated area dueto the interruption of axons, degeneration of distal nerve fibres,and eventual death of axotomised neurons (Allodi et al . 2012). Deficits can be compensated by regenerating injured axonsor by collateral branching of undamaged axons, andremodelling of nervous system circuitry related to the lostfunctions. Plasticity of central connections may compensatefunctionally for the lack of adequate target reinnervation;however, plasticity has limited effects on disturbed sensorylocalisation or fine motor control after injuries, and may evenresult in maladaptive changes, such as neuropathic pain andhyper-reflexia (Navarro 2009). The lack of specificity of nerveregeneration, in terms of motor and sensory axon regrowth,pathfinding and target reinnervation, is one of the mainshortcomings for recovery. Peripheral nerve regeneration has been extensively studied in function and gene expression using a sciaticnerve crush model in mice and rats (Vogelaar et al . 2004). Recovery of sensory and some motor function occurred inapproximately 3 weeks; however, with the return of sensoryfunction, a state of mechanical allodynia (painful experiencegenerated by non-noxious stimuli) develops and is slow toretreat. This is a component of neuropathic pain known to existin man and studied in laboratory animals, but only relativelyrecently considered as a source of chronic pain in horses (Grafvon Schweinitz 1999; Macgregor and Driessen et 2010; Muir 2010). Considering the risks of neuropathic pain from peripheral nerveinjury it is interesting to note the ongoing efforts to treatidiopathic headshaking in the horse by compression of theinfraorbital nerve, which has a reported initial success rate of63%, post operative nose rubbing rate of 63%, and symptom recurrence rate of 26% (Roberts et al . 2013). Different therapies have evolved to improve recovery from nerve injury including exercise, and electrical stimulation,but the functional outcome of nerve repair can still bedisappointing due to muscle atrophy, scar tissue, neuroma,disturbed sensory evolution, and poor motor control. Averageaxonal regeneration rate in mammals is 1-3 mm/day (Gordonet al . 2009) and the length of nerve damage in the horse may easily be several centimetres leading to a lengthyregeneration time with increased risks of unsatisfactoryregeneration. Electrical stimulation has shown positive results on peripheral nerve regeneration effects in laboratory animals,mostly using EA with implanted electrodes with differentelectrical parameters: weak constant direct current andpulsed alternating current et al . 2003; Mendon\u00e7a etal. 2003). One of the emerging links of EA being investigated is with the modulation of nerve growth factor in nerve repair(Manni et al . 2011). In a study of rats with transected median nerves one group received plain acupuncture for 15 min every 2 days from oneweek after injury using points (PC 3 and 7) near the proximaland distal nerve stumps; another group received EA (1 mA at2 Hz) to produce a visual muscle contraction; a third groupwere untreated controls (Ho et al . 2013). Both treatment groups had better morphological, electrophysiological andfunctional outcomes than the control group. Not all electrical stimulation forms are helpful. Some studies of electrical stimulation have also had negativeoutcomes illustrating that the intensity and frequency of theelectrical field plays an important role (Aydin et al . 2006). An investigation of transcutaneous electrical stimulation with low(4 Hz) and high (100 Hz) frequency transcutaneous electricalnerve stimulation (TENS) was undertaken as this technique isfrequently employed to control neuropathic pain (Baptistaet al . 2008). Using mice with a sciatic crush lesion treated 30 min daily, TENS 5 days/week for 5 weeks led to a delayedregeneration with negative morphological changes of nervetissue compared to an untreated control group, especially inthe high frequency TENS group. The timing of the applicationof EA after nerve injury also appears to be an important factor24 \u00a9 2013 EVJ LtdEQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JANUARY 2014(Yeh et al . 2010). In rats subjected to sciatic nerve section, those treated 8 days or 15 days later with low frequency (2 Hzat 1 mA) EA for 15 min every other day for 2 weeks hadsignificantly improved nerve regeneration, which was not thecase in the group treated from the first day. Similarly, exercise has been shown to be a positive or negative factor in nerve regeneration investigationsdependent on the exercise intensity and stress caused to theanimal (van Meeteren et al . 1998). Recently, low energy extracorporeal shock wave treatment has been shown toaccelerate the recovery of muscle sensitivity and function bypromoting regeneration after nerve compression injury in rats(Hausner et al . 2012; Mense and Hoheisel 2013). This still requires work to determine the appropriate dose andfrequency of treatment before it can be confidently used inthe horse. In the case report from de Fourmestraux et al . (2013), care was taken to select appropriate points and electricalstimulation properties based on the research, and to includean exercise tailored to the condition to optimise the chancesfor recovery. The significance being that it is possible to treatinappropriately, cause additional harm, and bring about anegative outcome from the use of EA. Similar case reports arelacking in the literature and hopefully this report will encouragesimilar ones. A case report of acupuncture in a dog with idiopathic facial nerve paralysis makes an interesting comparison (Jeonget al . 2001). A terrier with a 35 day acute onset of unilateral facial nerve paralysis and no improvement on dailyprednisolone at 1 mg/kg bwt was treated with dry needleacupuncture. Points on the face (LI 20, ST 2, ST 7, SI 18, TH 17and GB 3) were needled only on the contralateral side, and adistal forelimb and a hindlimb point was treated bilaterally (LI 4and GB 34 respectively) for 20 min every other day for the firstweek, then weekly for the next 3 weeks. Lip drooping and drooling were abolished after the first treatment, with progress to complete facial symmetry achieved by the last treatment.In this case there was no local stimulation on the affected sideindicating central neural reflexes and mechanisms wereresponsible for the improvements. Studies of neuropathicmechanisms from nerve injury demonstrate a unilateral injuryoften progresses to bilateral neuropathic changes (Beheraet al . 2013); interestingly, acupuncture treatment on the contralateral side has been shown to treat the opposite side(Kim et al . 2010). The use of EA in nerve regeneration in man has been reported, e.g. in carpal tunnel syndrome with severe axondegeneration and release surgery (Gordon et al . 2008). Trains of 20 Hz electrical stimulation for one hour to 2 weeksaccelerated axon outgrowth across the suture site inassociation with elevated neuronal neurotrophic factor andreceptors and promoted the full reinnervation of thenarmuscles in contrast to a nonsignificant increase in motor unitnumbers in the control group. Some critics may take issue with this example as not representing acupuncture because of a lack of adherence tothe traditional Chinese medicine language of yin and yang,and the flow of Qi, and one may then consider this anexample of western medical acupuncture. Acupuncture hashistorically evolved and traditional Chinese medicine isarguably grossly misrepresented by translation errors of theancient Chinese texts and the politics of the practice from laypractitioners (Birch and Felt 1999; Kendall 2002; Unschuld 2003;Schnorrenberger 2011). The advances in neuroscience have brought an increasing amount of evidence for the usefulnessand relatively low risks in a competent application ofacupuncture including the more modern forms of EA and laseracupuncture. More evidence in the form of controlled trials and clinical trials are required, but this can equally be applied to most of veterinary medicine.

Bumbacher, M. F. Bryner, A. E. F\u00fcrst, F. Del Chicca, S. K. Ringerand M. A. Department,Section of Imaging distal femur (LCP-DF) Summary A closed complete mid-diaphyseal spiral fracture of the left femur in a one-year-old donkey was treated with a 4.5 mm titanium locking compression plate distal femur (LCP-DF)1. This plate was originally manufactured for for femoral osteosynthesis. The LCP-DF 1has a distal head plate that was advantageous in this case becausethe distal fragment was smaller. Post operative radiographsshowed optimal femoral reconstruction and a callus waspresent 3 weeks after surgery. The donkey was sound at thewalk and trot 2 months after surgery. Radiographs taken 5months after surgery showed stable implants and completehealing without complications. Introduction Femoral fractures in equids usually result from severetraumatic events such as a fall or a kick and are mostcommon in foals and weanlings (Hance and Bramlage 1996;Richardson 2012). There have been several reports ofsuccessful treatment of femoral fracture in foals but the complication rate is high. In one study, 16 foals less than one year of age with diaphyseal femoral fracture were treatedsurgically; 4 had implant failure, 6 developed infections and 8of the fractures healed (Hance et al . 1992). In adult horses, femoral fracture repair is rarely achieved because of thelarge body mass of the patient and a predisposition toseverely comminuted fracture configurations (Hance andBramlage 1996). Although conservative treatment is possible,it is not the technique of choice and is often associatedwith varus deformation of the contralateral limb (Richardson2012). Diaphyseal femoral in by means of double-plating (Hance and Bramlage1996; Richardson 2012) but the use of an interlockingintramedullary nail (Radcliffe et al . 2001) or compression plating and cable cerclage (Frankeny et al . 1998) can also be successful. The locking compression plate (LCP) systemis an established technique of internal fixation of longbone fractures in horses, especially in cases that requireincreased stability of the fixation (Levine and Richardson2007; Jackson et al . 2011). The locking compression plate distal femur (LCP-DF) 1has a head with threaded holes and a shaft with combi-holes, which also accept corticalscrews. This case report describes a one-year-old donkey with a closed mid-diaphyseal femoral fracture repaired with atitanium plate (LCP-DF) 1, normally used in human osteosynthesis.Case details Case history A one-year-old jack donkey was referred to the EquineHospital of the University of Zurich with a tentative diagnosis of closed fracture of the left femur for consideration of possible surgical treatment. The donkey was thought to have beenkicked by another donkey. It had been sedated by thereferring veterinarian with the hospital in a trailer in sternal recumbency. Clinical and radiographic findings The donkey weighed 77 kg and was in good body condition.The general condition and demeanour were mildly impaired.There was no weightbearing on the left hindlimb. Manipulationof the proximal portion of the left hindlimb elicited pain. Therewas moderate swelling proximal to the left stifle and rotationalinstability but no crepitation. The overlying skin was intact andthere was no external bleeding. Results of a haematologicalexamination were normal. Mediolateral ( Fig 1 ) and craniocaudal (not shown) showed aclosed complete spiral mid-diaphyseal left femoral fracturewith well defined fracture edges. The distal fragment wassmaller than the proximal fragment because of the spiralnature of the fracture. There was marked cranial and mildmedial dislocation of the distal femoral fragment and severereduction of the distance between the hip joint and stiflebecause of overlap of the bone fragments. There were alsoseveral pinpoint mineral opacities in the fracture gap and softtissue swelling. Surgical details The donkey donkey positioned in right lateral recumbency. General anaesthesiawas maintained with isoflurane 8in oxygen and air by a large animal circle system9, combined with a medetomidine constant rate infusion (0.0035 mg/kg bwt/h). The left hindlimbwas prepared for aseptic surgery. A 25 cm skin incision wasmade from the trochanter major to the patella. Access to thefemur was achieved through a cut in the aponeurosis of themusculus tensor fasciae latae and further blunt dissection and biceps muscle of the27 \u00a9 LtdEQUINE VETERINARY AE 2014thigh. The fracture haematoma ( Fig 2 ) was removed. The bone fragments were reduced by applying traction to the limband using bone reduction forceps and a lag screw was inserted from caudolateral to craniomedial across the obliquefracture to achieve temporary fracture alignment . A 5 hole left titanium locking compression distal femur plate (LCP-DF) 1 (Fig 3 ) was then applied to the craniolateral aspect of the femur. The plate was fixed with 4 locking screws (LS) and one cortical screw in the 5 proximal shaft holes. Six locking screws were inserted distally in the head of the LCP-DF1(Fig 4 ). All screws were made of stainless steel and the holes drilledaccording to standard LCP technique (Wagner and Frigg 2006). After fixation of the implant, the surgical field was rinsedliberally using phosphate buffered saline solution. The musclesand fascia were adapted and sutured and the skin closed using staples. A stent was placed over the wound forprotection. Radiographic views taken at the end of the surgeryshowed good anatomical reduction of the fracture with radiolucent fracture lines still visible ( Fig 5 ). Recovery from anaesthesia was assisted and the donkey rose to its feetwithout problems. Post surgical management and outcome The donkey was returned to its stall and was able to rise withoutassistance. It was weightbearing in the left hindlimb for 5 days. Soft tissue swelling had resolved by 2 weeks after surgery and the stent and staples were removed. Radiographs taken 20 days after surgery showed very good axial alignment of the femur (Figs 6a and b) and correct positioning of all the implants. The original fracture lines were less distinct and slightly further apartthan immediately after surgery. Faint periosteal new bone formation was seen proximal to the plate on the mediolateralview. Furthermore, lamellar and solid periosteal new bonedeposition consistent with callus formation was visible in the medial mid-diaphysis region at the level of the 3rd and 4th Fig 1: Preoperative mediolateral radiographic view of the left femur of a one-year-old donkey in left lateral recumbency.

The donkey was sound and was discharged 21 days post operatively. Five months after surgerythe donkey was re-evaluated. It had been pastured in theAlps, was sound at the walk and trot and in good bodycondition. Radiographic views of the left femur taken with aportable x-ray machine confirmed complete healing of thefracture. The radiolucent fracture lines seen on radiographs 20days after surgery were no longer visible ( Fig 7 ). Discussion An excellent outcome was achieved with a single distal femoral locking compression plate (LCP-DF)1in a one-year-old donkey with closed complete mid-diaphyseal spiral femoralfracture. The main 2012), which can result from thefracture itself or from post fracture soft tissue trauma (Hanceand Bramlage 1996). Post operative infection and implantfailure are often related to seroma formation (Hance et al . 1992). Factors that led to a favourable outcome withoutcomplications in our patient were the calm temperament andlow bodyweight (77 kg). It is well known that femoral fractureosteosynthesis in foals, ponies and small donkeys has a muchbetter prognosis than in heavier equine Byron et al . 2002). For this reason, surgical treatment of femoral fractures is rarely attempted in the latter and affectedhorses are often subjected to euthanasia (Hance et al . 1992).A lower bodyweight is not the only reason why foals and other young horses with femoral fracture are better young horses with femoral fracture typically have a large spiral component caused by torsionalforce (Hance et al Bramlage and Fackelmann which makes the fracture easier to stabilisethan a comminuted fracture, which typically occurs in adulthorses. Young and growing animals also have a higher rate ofbone repair and form a stronger callus than older patients(Mehta 2010). Double-plating with one plate positioned cranially and the other laterally on the femur is an established surgical treatmentfor femoral fracture (Radcliffe et al . 2001). et al 1992; Fackelmann 2000) as well as rotational forces. Comparedwith other methods, this construct provides greater strengthand stiffness (Radcliffe et al . 2001). Because of the fracture configuration with a long spiral component through themiddle of the bone, double-plating was not feasible in ourpatient, mainly because the screws of the lateral plate wouldhave been positioned parallel to the plane of the fracture. Forthis reason, it was necessary to achieve stabilisation with asingle plate placed craniolaterally on the femur. Alternatively,a plate combined with cerclage wire (Frankeny et al 1998), intramedullary interlocking nail (IIN) fixation or IIN fixationcombined with a dynamic compression plate (Radcliffe et al . 2001) could have been used in our patient. However, because Fig 5: Post operative mediolateral radiographic view of the left femur of a one-year-old donkey in left lateral recumbency. Cranialis on the left side of the left of the image. The LCP-DF has beenplaced craniolaterally on the femur and good fracture reduction isapparent. A urinary catheter is visible at the top of the image.

It provided amore stable fixation compared with a conventional LCP thatwould allow only one or 2 screws in the distal fragment(Kirker-Head and Fackelmann 1989) and the combination ofthe titanium plate and stainless steel screws was notassociated with implant instability attributable to galvaniccorrosion (Disegi 2009). The strength of LCP-DF 1was previously demonstrated in a biomechanical study that showed that itsaxial stiffness was greater than that of a dynamic condylarscrew (DCS) plate (Kim et al . 2011). The main advantage of the LCP-DF 1is that short terminal fragments are more easily fixed because up to 7 screws can be inserted, similar to thestainless steel cobra head plate (Kirker-Head and Fackelmann1989). The LCP-DF originally fractures inman. The LCP-DF 1is available in a right and left version to adapt to the lateral condyles of the human femur. To ourknowledge, this is the first time that this plate has been used inequine surgery and it was shown to be very beneficial. A recent in vitro study compared the use of titanium and stainless steel in fracture fixation (Hayes and Richards 2010).Titanium is used in plates because it provides stiffness,biocompatibility, ductility and strength, prerequisites forappropriate fracture fixation. The LCP-DF 1is made of various titanium alloys which have higher tensile strength capabilityand lower ductility than pure titanium (Disegi 2012). Thematerial most often used for internal fixation in equine osteosynthesis is stainless steel. Stainless steel is also a very stiff and strong metal with high yield strength and can thereforeundergo more countering and bending cycles before failureoccurs compared with titanium. The titanium LCP-DF 1is anatomically precontoured and therefore is not meant toundergo bending by the surgeon before placement. However,this plate has been developed for human orthopaedic surgeryand some degree of bending may be unavoidable if it is used in other species. Titanium alloy is more flexible and has higher fatigue resistance than stainless steel and therefore is capableof adapting to deformations of the bone more closely.Another difference between these 2 metals relates to theirinteraction with bone. There is always a gap between boneand stainless steel filled with fibroid tissue, but not betweenbone and titanium, and therefore titanium alloy should, atleast theoretically, better integrate with bone than stainlesssteel. The surface of a titanium alloy plate is rougher then thatof a stainless steel plate because stainless steel iselectropolished. These characteristics of titanium enhance osseointegration providing superior implant stability. Interestingly, however, clinical evaluations of human surgicalpatients failed to show distinct differences in healing betweenstainless steel and titanium implants (Hayes and Richards2010). The use of titanium alloy implants is not commonplace inequine osteosynthesis, but because implants in this speciesmay be subjected to very large cyclic loads, titanium maynevertheless hold promise for this indication. Because thefracture healed without complications and the plateappeared well integrated in the bone, implant removal wasdeemed unnecessary in our patient. Conclusion A titanium LCP-DF1was used successfully for the surgical repair of a mid-diaphyseal femoral fracture in a young donkey. Wefeel that this plate provides a promising option for femur repairin small equids and possibly for other selected fractures in adulthorses. The plate head with 7 threaded holes makes it usefulfor fractures with small terminal fragments or fractureconfigurations that are not amenable to fixation with 2 LCPs.Furthermore, titanium alloys have several properties thatsupport fracture healing and possibly reduce the risk ofinfection.

Corresponding author email: alistair.barr@bristol.ac.uk The case report by Bumbacher et al . (2014) describes the management of a closed, complete, spiral, mid-diaphysealfracture of the femur in a yearling donkey weighing 77 kg.Internal fixation was achieved via a lateral surgical approachusing a titanium locking compression plate distal femur (LCP-DF) applied craniolaterally along with a single lag screw. The fracture healed satisfactorily and at 5 months post surgerythe donkey was sound at the walk and trot. Femoral fractures are said to be more common in young horses (Richardson 2012) although as smaller, younger horsestend to be the only ones where surgical repair may becontemplated there is probably significant selection prior toreferral to surgical facilities. The high energy required tofracture the femur in an adult horse often results in severelycomminuted fractures that are rarely amenable to treatmentand usually warrant humane destruction. Femoral fracture configurations in horses include: V ,LIRCG;F\u0007B?;>;H>H?=E\b@L;=NOL?M V )C> proximal cranial femoral cortex are also said to occur (Hawkins 2003). Diaphyseal fractures in young horses are usually a consequence of a fall or external blow. Clinical signs usuallycomprise acute severe lameness, swelling (and sometimesshortening) of the thigh region, pain on manipulation,rotational instability and, in some cases, crepitation onmanipulation of the limb (although the latter was not a featurein the case reported here emphasising that fragmentseparation by haemorrhage, inflammatory swelling andinterposing muscle can be sufficient to minimise this sign).Radiographic examination is best performed under generalanaesthesia or deep sedation that will allow the animal to beplaced in lateral recumbency for mediolateral views and indorsal recumbency for craniocaudal views distal physeal fractures may beminimal and good quality images will be required to diagnosethe injury in such cases. Diaphyseal femoral fractures are generally spiral or long oblique in configuration and usually closed because of theextensive surrounding musculature ( Fig 1 ). There may be significant overriding of fragments due to muscle contracture.Spiral fractures may be a consequence of torsional loadingwhich results in shear stresses distributed over the entire bone.Bone strength and stiffness in torsion is dependent oncross-sectional area and the distribution of bone around theneutral axis which together determine the polar moment ofCH?LNC;I@NB?<IH?\u0007);LE?F\u0010\u0018\u0018\u0015\b *;NOL;FCLL?AOF;LCNC?MCH<IH? shape may concentrate stresses at certain points in the bone(stress risers). Experimentally, the weakening effect of stressrisers is particularly prominent under torsional loading(Edgerton et al \u0010\u0018\u0018\u000f\b IH?>?@?=NMQCFF;=N;MMNL?MMLCM?LM;H> the absence of bone defects in the caudal cortex following reduction and fixation is felt to be important to prognosisclinically (Bramlage and Fackelman 2000). Other than trochanteric fractures which can often be managed successfully conservatively, femoral fractures inhorses remain a major management challenge to equineorthopaedic surgeons. Conservative management is probablyonly likely to be successful for trochanteric fractures and stableminimally displaced distal physeal fractures and shouldcomprise 3 months box rest in L;GF;A? \u0010\u0018\u0018\u0015\b NN?GJNM ;N androtational deformity of the femur together with marked varusangular limb deformity of the contralateral limb due toexcessive weightbearing during healing. Open reduction and internal fixation is thus generally the only realistic option for management of major completefemoral diaphyseal fractures if there is to be any hope of areasonable functional outcome. The surgical approach, as inthe case reported here, is a lateral one. The incision runs fromslightly caudal to the greater trochanter to the lateralepicondyle of the femur along the cranial border of the biceps femoris muscle. The deep fascia is incised in the intermuscular septum between the superficial gluteal muscle and distally. attachment of the superficial gluteal to the third trochanter may be incised and reflectedcranially and the insertion of the biceps femoris muscle on the lateral patellar ligament can be partially incised to provideincreased exposure in more distal fractures. The lateral aspectof the femur is then exposed to the main proximal or distal fragments with lag screws trying to avoid thescrew heads being in positions that will compromisesubsequent placement of plates or using 3.5 mm screws anddeeply countersinking the heads to avoid them interfering.Reduction of the main fracture fragments can provechallenging particularly when, as is often the case, thereduced configuration is not inherently stable. Significanttraction may be required on the lower limb and anchoring thetail and body of the animal to the table in anticipation of thisis worthwhile. Large bone-holding forceps to manipulate andsecure fragments during reduction are helpful and oncereduced one or more lag screws should be placed to securealignment during plate application.32 \u00a9 2013 EVJ LtdEQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JANUARY 2014Optimal implant choice has progressed over the last 40 years since the first descriptions of internal fixation of equinefemoral fractures. Denny (1978) reported the attemptedsurgical management of 5 cases of femoral diaphysealfractures in neonatal foals. Two were treated with stackedintrameduallary pins, 2 with Venables plates and one with anASIF broad dynamic compression plate. In all cases, fixationfailed within 10 days of surgery and the foals had to behumanely destroyed. Since that time implants used haveincluded broad dynamic compression plates, cobra headplates, angle blade plates and dynamic condylar screwplates. Richardson (2012) recommended double plating using4.5 mm locking compression plates with 5.5 mm cortex screwsand 5 mm locking head screws. As long a plate as possible ispositioned laterally and then a shorter one placed craniallywith interdigitating screws. An interlocking intramedullary nailmay be an alternative for simple fractures not requiringadditional lag screws. Bramlage and Fackelman (2000) andRichardson (2012) emphasise the importance of closedsuction drainage to minimise serum accumulation for the first3-4 days post operatively. Seroma formation can predisposeto wound dehiscence and infection which are common postoperative complications (Richardson 2012). Approximately50% of foals with diaphyseal fractures, repaired by internalfixation with double plating, will have satisfactory healing.Bramlage and Fackelman (2000) state that the majority offoals with successful outcomes are less than 3 months of agewhen presented with their fractures. In the case reported here a single plate was deployed craniolaterally because the surgeons were concerned aboutthe potential for screws to end up parallel to the plane of thefracture if a double plating technique were deployed. The expanded distal end of the LCP-DF also allows for up to 7screws to be placed in the distal fragment which providesadditional stability in the repair of fractures that extend closeto the distal physis. Figure 6 in the paper by Bumbacher et al . (2014) suggests the fracture in this case healed with limitedradiographically visible bony callus which implies goodfracture stability during healing and is in contrast to the large calluses previously observed in other cases (Bramlage and Fackelman 2000; Richardson 2012). Surgical removal ofimplants is rarely required unless there are problems withinfection or growth compromise by implants which cross thedistal physis. Bumbacher et al . (2014) discuss the potential mechanical advantages of titanium alloys and theirenhanced capacity for integration with bone. There is alsosome evidence in man that titanium implants may also reducethe risk of delayed infection compared to stainless steelimplants (Glotzbecker et al . 2013). Successful surgical treatment of femoral diaphyseal fractures in young horses probably hinges particularly on careful case selection in the first place, focusing on the sizeand temperament of the patient and configuration of thefracture together with the availability of the requisite facilities,equipment and experienced surgical staff. Balancing theconfidence and optimism to attempt the possible with theneed to recognise and heed the warning signs of likely failureremain crucial as ever to the surgical art. The successfuldeployment of new implants such as the titanium lockingcompression plate distal femur (LCP-DF) described byBumbacher et al . (2014) shows that progress continues to be made to make such repairs more likely to succeed. Author's declaration of interests No conflicts of interest have been declared.

However, failures and subsequent production of testosterone and stallion-like behaviour have been previously identified.Laparoscopic castration without removal of the testes was performed in 32 horses with 2 normal descended scrotal testes between July 2006 and October 2012. The objectives ofour study were to evaluate the success rate of laparoscopiccastration without orchidectomy on descended testes in ourpopulation and assess complications and recovery time.Endocrine tests were performed after surgery and owners alsoasked to report on their horse's behaviour and ability toresume exercise. Castration was deemed successful ifendocrine test results were in accordance with geldingvalues. Failed horses were castrated using a conventionaltechnique and histology performed when possible. Basaltestosterone levels decreased below 3 nmol/l after surgeryin 30/32 cases. However, in 2 horses, stallion behaviourpersisted and histological evaluation after inguinal castrationshowed residual viable tissue. Two horses maintained hightestosterone levels after surgery associated with stallion-likebehaviour. Based on these results, 12.5% of horses (4/32horses) failed to be considered a gelding based on eitherendocrine tests and/or histology. All horses, with oneexception, were able to resume exercise less than aweek after the procedure. Laparoscopic castration withoutorchidectomy appears to be a safe procedure. Whenassessing the success of laparoscopic castration, our totalfailure rate was 12.5% (4/32 horses) which is significantlyhigher than previously reported. Introduction Laparoscopic castration in standing horses eliminates therequirement for general anaesthesia and its associated risks.This technique also allows visual confirmation that adequatehaemostasis of the mesorchium occurs and may offer theadvantage of a more rapid return to function technically easyand efficient approach for ensuring haemostasis of themesorchium in horses and Vachon hasbeen described as one method to castrate horses(Rijkenhuizen and Grinwis 1999). Earlier studies performed indonkeys, ponies and horses with normally descended testeshave shown that intra-abdominal ligation of the spermatic cord resulted in avascular necrosis of the testes and in One reported case of revascularisation of a testis left in the inguinalcanal following transection of the mesorchium and ductus deferens suggested that more research was necessary (Bergeron et al . 1998). Surgical success results from avascular necrosis of the testes. However, surgical failures and thesubsequent production of testosterone and stallion-likebehaviour have been identified (Rijkenhuizen and Grinwis1999). Recently, a study reported that even with adequatetechnique, procedural failure occurred in 7% of horseswith descended testes. Initial failures were attributed toinsufficient ligation of the spermatic cord, but a smallnumber of operations also failed despite completetransection of the entire spermatic cord (Voermans et al . 2006). Revascularisation of the testes castrated usinglaparoscopy was attributed to a tributary from the externalpudendal artery. Therefore, laparoscopic castration withoutorchidectomy was not recommended as a reliable method forcastration in normal stallions (Voermans et al . 2006). Laparoscopic castration leaving the testicles in situ is a less invasive alternative to more conventional castrationtechniques, but may result in residual active testicular tissueand persistent stallion behaviour. Endocrine tests such astestosterone basal concentration and the human chorionicgonadotropin (hCG) response test can be used to identifyhorses that have been castrated but potentially have viabletesticular tissue remaining. Testosterone concentration hasbeen utilised as a reliable method of identifying viabletesticular tissue in horses (Wilson et al . 1996; Bergeron et al . 1998). Total testosterone concentration can bemeasured quantitatively with a modified testosteroneradioimmunoassay (Spectria) 1and has been shown to deliver clinically useful information in man (Norjavaara andAnkarberg-Lindgren 2011). If the baseline testosteroneconcentration is higher than expected in a gelding, it isthought to be an indicator of the presence of viable testiculartissue (Bergeron et al . 1998). Intravenous injection of hCG to horses possessing testicular tissuestimulate a rise in testosterone concentration. There should beno increase above basal testosterone concentrations in horseswith no viable testicular tissue (Cox et al . 1973; Searle et al . 1999). Our study objectives were to evaluate the success rateof laparoscopic castration without orchidectomy throughendocrine tests and behaviour evaluation on our populationof horses. Complications and recovery time were alsoevaluated.34 \u00a9 2013 EVJ LtdEQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JANUARY 2014Materials and methods Inclusion criteria The study examined data pertaining to male horses castrated laparoscopically without orchidectomy between July 2006 and October 2012 and for which endocrine test results after surgery and subsequent behavioural information were available. Cryptorchid horses (either abdominal or inguinaltestes) were excluded from the study. Surgical procedure Before surgery, horses were placed on a low residue diet for 48 h prior to surgery. An i.v. catheter was placed in the right jugular vein and administered restrained in standing stocks. The left and right flanks were clipped and aseptically prepared for laparoscopic surgery. Subsequent sedation was maintained with a continuous rate infusion of detomidine, 20g/kg bwt/h (Detogesic)2adjusted to maintain the level of sedation needed. Surgery was consistently initiated on the left side. Three portal sites in the paralumbar fossae were locally the paralumbar A 15 mm incision was made atthe dorsal border of the internal abdominal oblique muscleequidistant from the tuber coxae and last rib. A 10 mm secured pyramidal trocar-cannula unit 4was inserted blindly through the paralumbar fossa angled towards the oppositestifle. The trocar was removed and a straight laparoscope 5(0\u00b0, 10 mm, 33 cm) inserted into the cannula and angled caudally.A video camera and light source were attached to the laparoscope and insufflation tubing then attached to the laparoscopic cannula. Abdominal insufflation with carbon dioxide was achieved and the abdomen insufflated until intra-abdominal pressure was raised 8-10 mmHg. Afteridentifying the vaginal ring, a second 15 mm incision was made 5-7 cm dorsal and slightly cranially to the laparoscope portal to serve as the first instrument portal. Local anaestheticsolution was administered in the ipsilateral mesorchium with lidocaine (Xylovet) 3. A third 15 mm incision, 5-10 cm ventral to the first portal, was made to serve as the second instrument portal. The laparoscope was placed in the upper portal. The mesorchium and ductus deferens were grasped with Babcock forceps inserted through the middle portal. The plica vasculosa including 910 USP 2 (Vicryl)6as close as possible to the vaginal ring by a double Roeder knot and completely transected between theligatures (Horses Nos. vaginal ring ( Fig 1 ). At the end of the procedure, the distal part of the spermatic stump was retracted completely in the inguinal canal and the transectedmesorchium inspected for haemorrhage ( Fig 2 ). The testis was left in place to undergo avascular necrosis. The laparoscope and instruments were removed and cutaneous incisions closed with stainless steel staples. The same procedure was performed on the right side. Post operatively, horses receiveda single dose of flunixine meglumine, 1.1 bwt orally b.i.d. for 3 days and s.i.d. for 3 days, (Equipalazone)8. Ceftiofur, 2.2 mg/kg bwt s.i.d. (Excenel)2was given for 2 days following surgery. Staples were removed after 10-14 days. Owners were advised that testes, deprived of their blood supply, would swell during the first week and then begin to decrease in size. The atrophied testes could be palpated in thescrotum for several weeks, but by 5 months post operativelythe remnants should no longer be palpable. Owners were alsoinformed that previous data indicated a 7% failure rate in theoperation and, if this occurred, testes would be removed witha conventional surgical procedure. Endocrine protocol Endocrine tests were performed a minimum of 3 weeks after the procedure to evaluate the success of castration. Serum samples were first extracted with organic solvent (ethylacetate/cyclohexane, 1/1) and total basal testosteroneconcentration measured by a modified radioimmunoassay Fig 1: Laparoscopic view of the right internal inguinal ring in a standing horse with ligation using the Ligasure device7to seal and transect the mesorchium and ductus deferens just above the vaginal ring. Fig 2: View of the right internal inguinal ring in a standing horse competitive radioimmunoassay principle (Spectria Testosterone Radioimmunoassay Kit)1. The analytical detection limit is better than 0.1 nmol/l and the functional detection limit is approximately 0.3 nmol/l with a 10% coefficient of variation. If the test was performed less than 4weeks after castration, basal testosterone concentration onlywas measured. If endocrine tests were performed more than 4weeks after surgery, a hCG stimulation test was iu/kg bwt hCG (Chorulon) 9with of 15,000 iu/horse. According to our laboratory (LDHVet)representative reference limits, horses were classified as'gelding-like' if the basal testosterone concentration was lessthan 3 nmol/l and/or when there was no rise in testosterone concentration after the stimulation test. Owners were contacted by telephone at least 3 weeks after surgery todetermine the horse's behaviour and ability to resume exercise following the procedure. Horses with persistent stallion behaviour (vocalising, excitement, attempts to mount otherhorses, etc), failure to decrease their testosterone levels below3 nmol/l and/or with a positive hCG stimulation test severalweeks after surgery were readmitted for castration using aninguinal closed castration. Histopathology was performed onthe excised testes Testes were fixed in a 10%neutral buffered formalin solution for 48 h and tissue sectionsstained with haematoxylin-eosin saffron and examined microscopically. Results The study included 32 mature horses aged 2-10 years (mean 6 years). All testes were descended in the scrotum and deemednormal in size, shape and position. The population included 28Selle Fran\u00e7ais stallions, one KWPN, one Oldenburg, one Barbe,one Holsteiner and one stallion of unknown origin. All horseswere in training at the time of surgery. Physical examination,haematology and biochemistry results showed noabnormalities prior to surgery. Outcome Basal testosterone levels were measured in 17/32 horses,between 3 and 4 weeks after castration. In the remaininghorses (15/32), tests measuring testosterone levels before andafter hCG stimulation were performed. Detailed results of theendocrine tests are available in Table 1 . Basal testosterone levels were below 3 nmol/l after surgery in 30/32 cases. In 2/32 horses (6,25%), high testosterone levels ( >3 nmol/l) were measured. Horse No .8had high testosterone levels and persistent stallion behaviour. Horse No .18had 2 separate testosterone level assays. The first assay was performedbetween 3 and 4 weeks after surgery and showed a lowtestosterone level (2.3 nmol/l) according to our laboratoryreference limits. However, the horse continued to displaystallion behaviour, and another assay was performed 6 monthslater, which showed a high testosterone level (6 nmol/l). Those2 horses were considered to have had 'failed' showed a decreased basal testosterone level(<3 stallion-like behaviour was still present horses . Horse No .6had a basal testosterone measurement of 2 nmol/l, stallion behaviour was persistent and the ownersopted to have an inguinal closed castration performed. Horse No.7had 2 basal testosterone assays showing low values: 0 nmol/l between 3 and 4 weeks after surgery and 0.6 nmol/l8 months after surgery. An hCG stimulation test was also doneone year after laparoscopic castration and was positive. In this horse, persistent stallion behaviour also motivated the ownersto request a closed inguinal castration. Those 4 horses were subsequently castrated with a standard castration technique and histopathologicalexamination of the testicles was performed on only 3 horses(Nos.6, 7 and 8). On gross examination, all epididymes appeared normal and all testes were markedly reduced in size, resulting in relative prominence of the epididymes. On cross-section, testes were dull and yellowish green .As observed in a previous study, testes were largely necrotic andnormal testicular parenchyma was present in the most caudalpart of the testis, adjacent to the proper ligament ( Fig 3 ). In those 4 horses, testes partially viable were larger and easy topalpate and partially visible in the scrotum. The castrationeliminated the stallion-like behaviour in all of the 4 horses. No intra-operative complications occurred. Short-term complication occurred in one horse that presented asignificant important scrotal oedema associated with lameness until 2 weeks after surgery, which resolved with medical treatment consisting of frequent lungeing, nonsteroidalanti-inflammatory drugs and diuretic administration. All horses,with the exception of this one, were able to go back to work lessthan a week after the procedure. Histological evaluation Histological results were available for 3/4 horses (6 testes). In 2horses ( Nos.6and 8), one testis was completely necrotic and one testis was only partially necrotic with persistence of viabletesticular tissue. In the third horse ( No.7), both testes were partially necrotic. In all cases, the epididymis was spared.Testicular degeneration and necrosis were characterisedby the presence of ischaemic necrosis of calcification ( Figs 4a and b). Viable tissue was assessed by the presence of preserved tubulesassociated with the germinal cells ( Figs 5a and b). Discussion Compared to conventional castration methods, the laparoscopic castration technique shows minimal intra- andpost operative complications (Fischer and Vachon 1992, 1998;Davis 1997; Walmsley 1999; Pepe et al . 2005). The technique of leaving the testis in situ to undergo avascular necrosis decreases the potential for excess oedema, haemorrhage,infection, lameness and evisceration, when compared withother et al . 1996; Bergeron et al . 1998). Swelling and signs of pain observed after laparoscopic surgery are less severe than those seen afterroutine castration and are an expected response to thenecrotic testicular tissue (Wilson et al . 1996). Therefore, this technique can be used on horses that need to be stall-restedfor various conditions including severe orthopaedic lesions andhorses not able to cope with general anaesthesia and/orrecovery. No life-threatening complications have beendescribed with this minimally invasive technique. Theconvalescence time is also considerably reduced comparedwith other conventional techniques et al . 2006). In our population, all horses but one castrated in this fashion wereable to go back to work in less than a week, which is aneconomical consideration for horses in training. It is important \u00a9 2013 EVJ Ltd36 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JANUARY 2014to note that all horses castrated in this fashion are not fertile since the ductus deferens is ligated or transected. Disadvantages of this procedure include the cost, requirementof considerable staff and equipment, surgical expertise andneed for endocrine tests to assess the success or failure of thistechnique. In our study, the majority of horses had decreased testosterone levels after surgery. However, 2 horses maintainedhigh basal testosterone levels, indicating a failure to effectivelyinduce sufficient necrosis of the testicles. This was confirmedby the presence of residual viable testicular tissue inhistopathological examination. Additionally, these 2 horsesdisplayed stallion-like behaviour. In these horses, failure todecrease testosterone levels and persistent male behaviourcould be explained by the presence of viable testicular tissue.Most testes that were submitted to histological evaluationshowed only partial necrosis and normal testicularparenchyma was present. Epididymis were preserved as described previously by Voermans et al . (2006). However, it is well recognised that androgens are not produced by theepididymis and therefore epididymal tissue cannot influencemasculine behaviour (Cox et al . 1973; Searle et al . 1999). Presence of residual viable testicular tissue might be due to anincomplete transection of the mesorchium or to an alternateblood supply to the testis by vessels derived from the externalpudendal artery, as described by Voermans et al . (2006). It was shown in this study that even if blood flow through one ofthe major arteries is interrupted, anastomosing vessels mayprovide sufficient perfusion to maintain viable testicular tissue.Arteries originating from the external pudendal artery mayreach the testis through the proper ligament of the testis andprevent complete necrosis. In our study, this finding issupported by the fact that most residual viable testicular tissuewas found in the caudal part of affected testes, in closeTABLE 1: Detailed results of endocrine tests, laboratory conclusions and horse's behaviour several weeks after the surgical procedure No.Time (laparoscopy - endocrine tests) Time (laparoscopy - closed castration Breed/Age BT hCG stimulation testStallion behaviour after surgeryInguinal closed castration Histology conclusion 1 <4 weeks FSH, 9 Yo 0 No No 2 <4 weeks FSH, 5 Yo 0 No No 3 <4 weeks FSH, 7 Yo 1 No No 4 <4 weeks Unknown, 6 Yo 0 No No 5 <4 weeks Oldenburger, 8 Yo 0.1 No No 6 <4 weeks KWPN, 5 Yo 2 Yes Yes 1 year and 5 months Residual viable tissue 7 <4 weeks FSH, 5 Yo #0 Yes 8 months 0.6 Yes11 months 0.6 + Yes Yes 1 year Residual viable tissue 8 >4 weeks FSH, 5 Yo 5 + Yes Yes 7 months Residual viable tissue 9 >4weeks FSH, 8 Yo #0 No No 10 >4 weeks FSH, 8 Yo #0 No No 11 <4 weeks FSH, 8 Yo #0 No No 12 >4 weeks FSH, 5 Yo 0.1 No No 13 >4weeks FSH, 3 Yo #0 No No 14 >4 weeks FSH, 3 Yo 0.3 No No 15 <4 weeks FSH, 9 Yo 0.3 No No 16 >4weeks FSH, 3 Yo 0.2 No No 17 >4 weeks FSH, 8 Yo 0 No No 18 <4 weeks FSH, 6 Yo 2.3 Yes 7 months 6 Yes Yes 1 year 19 >4 weeks FSH, 4 Yo 0.1 No No 20 >4weeks FSH, 2 Yo 0.1 No No 21 <4 weeks FSH, 10 Yo 2 No No 22 >4 weeks Barbe, 10 Yo 1 No No 23 <4 weeks FSH, 6 Yo 0.1 No No 24 >4 weeks FSH, 4 Yo #0 No No 25 >4 weeks FSH, 4 Yo #0 No No 26 >4 weeks FSH, 4 Yo #0 No No 27 <4 weeks FSH, 6 Yo 0.4 No No 28 <4 weeks FSH, 6 Yo #0 No No 29 <4 weeks FSH, 6 Yo #0 No No 30 <4 weeks FSH, 6 Yo #0 No No 31 <4 weeks FSH, 6 Yo #0 No No 32 <4 weeks Holsteiner, 6 Yo #0 No No FSH: EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JANUARY 2014proximity to the proper ligament of the testis. A laparoscopic castration failure rate of 7% was attributed to this phenomenon(Voermans et al . 2006). Interestingly, in our study, 2 horses had a low basal testosterone level according to LDHvet laboratory referencelimits but continued to display stallion behaviour several weeksto months after surgery. This behaviour resulted in the owners opting for a standard castration to be performed. In these 2 horses, histopathology also showed the presence of residualviable testicular tissue. We hypothesised that in these 2 cases,low testosterone levels might be due to a very small amount of viable testicular tissue. Subjectively, on histological examination, we found that a horse with a high testosteroneconcentration post castration ( Horse No .8) seemed to have a larger amount of viable tissue compared to horses with a lowlevel of testosterone ( Horse No .7), in which a very small part of viable tissue was observed histologically. It is likely that the amount of residual viable testicular tissue influences themeasured testosterone levels. Unfortunately, we were not ableto effectively calculate the proportion of viable tissue in 'failedhorses' testicles. Those 2 horses were in the upper limit of our cut-off mark. It is likely that with a lower cut-off value, we would have considered these horses as 'failed' based solely on hormonal assays. As there is a 'grey area' with overlapping values inbasal testosterone levels between geldings and stallions, erroneous conclusion might be made. We took LDHVetlaboratory's standards when evaluating results of hormonalassays to classify horses and it seems our cut-off value is high.However, it is important to consider the fact that we measuredtotal testosterone concentration after extraction, which mightbe a reason why our basal testosterone levels in geldings are higher than those previously published. According toVoermans et al . (2006), cut-off value to confirm a castration is <0.09 nmol/l and according to Arighi and Bosu (1989),concentration of 0.83 nmol/l is diagnostic of absence of testicular tissue. Examining our results and due to the fact that Horse No .7 with a repeated basal testosterone level of 0.6 nmol presentedviable testicular on histological examination, horses between 0.5 and 3 nmol/l should be stimulated to assess success of castration. Measurement of serum testosterone alone is not sufficient to assess the gonadal function and must be backedup with other clinically relevant data, repeat endocrine test inthe following months, including spring months or hCGstimulation test. Even if behaviour does not always corroboratewith the presence of viable testicular tissue, it should be evaluated as this may be a predictor of castration failure.When assessing success of laparoscopic castration, our total failure rate was 12.5% (4/32 horses) which is significantly higherthan previously reported. The number of cases included in ourstudy is smaller than in the results presented by Voermans et al . (2006) and additional cases are needed to validate our findings. We conclude that this study confirms that laparoscopic castration without orchidectomy cannot berecommended for castration of normal stallions and has to be Fig 3: Macroscopic aspect of a partially necrotic testis with a preserved caudal part and a spared epididymis. a) b) Fig 4: a) Diffuse coagulative necrosis of seminiferous tubules (blackarrows) with mineralisation and degenerative interstitial cells (*) lesion).

Fischer Jr Chino Valley Equine Hospital, Chino Hills, California, USA. Corresponding author email: t.fischer@att.net The article by de Fourmestraux et al . (2014) presents a nicely constructed clinical study in which the authors evaluated thetechnique of laparoscopic sectioning of the mesorchium andvas deferens in standing horses, leaving the testicle to undergo ischaemic necrosis in situ . Testosterone levels were then obtained at least 3 weeks post surgically and correlated with behavioural outcomes. Four of the 32 horses retainedstallion-like behaviour and were considered failed castrations. These subsequently underwent open castration. Two of the 4 horses had an elevated testosterone at the first sampling. Ofthe remaining 2 horses, one had a testosterone level near thelevel considered consistent with being a stallion and the othera normal resting testosterone level positive on HCG stimulationtesting. This study has confirmed that the blood supply to thetesticle may be preserved via the external pudendal arterywhen only the mesorchium is transected, as shown byVoermans et al . (2006). On reading the study by Voermans et al. (2006), where there was a 7% failure rate for castration, my conclusion was that this is not a suitable technique forcastration except in very specific circumstances and thepresent study with a 12% failure rate confirms this. As theauthors suggest in the present study, this procedure might beindicated in horses where general anaesthesia is consideredunsafe, such as horses convalescing from orthopaedic injuries.Other indications for this procedure are if the horse to becastrated has an increased risk of a life threateningcomplication vs. other horses. The authors suggest that thisprocedure has a shorter convalescence time than openprocedures but this has not been my experience as normaland cryptorchid castrations are returned to full training in thesame amount of time (one week) that the authors suggest.One of the downsides of leaving the testicles in situ occurs if the horses are exported to the United States prior to thetesticles fully atrophying. Veterinary inspectors observe testiclesin a supposedly castrated animal and the horse must eitherundergo an expensive contagious equine metritis (CEM)quarantine or undergo surgery for removal of the testicles prior to being released from quarantine into the US. When thisoccurs, the client has definitely not saved money by paying for2 procedures or having the horse undergo a protractedquarantine. The horse also undergoes a second surgery with its associated risks. Whilst articles have previously been written on ovariectomy without removal of the ovary (Shoemaker et al . 2004) and castration without removal of the testicle, my belief is that removal of the testicle or ovary is indicated as a good surgical technique. Allowing tissue to undergo ischaemicnecrosis within the abdomen puts the horse at risk ofadhesions. I would be interested in a study that followed thelevels of inflammatory mediators in horses undergoingcastration with or without removal of the testicle. While a staunch advocate for developing laparoscopic procedures for horses, this technique does not address theanatomic fact that some horses' testicles have a blood supplyvia the external pudendal artery which allows them tomaintain their stallion-like behaviour resulting in a failedsurgery. This anatomic limitation precludes the use of thisprocedure except in very specific instances. Author's declaration of interests No competing interests have been declared.

Ohnesorge Clinic for Horses, University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Hannover, Germany andEquine Clinic, Department of Veterinary Medicine of Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin, head and neck position Summary The objective of this study was to examine laryngeal function at rest and during ridden exercise and to further analyse the impact of different head and neck positions on the laryngeal function in ridden sport horses. Fifty-eight Warmblood horseswere examined endoscopically during ridden exercise as well as during quiet breathing at rest before and after sedation. Four different head-neck positions (unrestrained, reference,elevation and hyperflexion) were assessed during the exercisetest. Laryngeal function was graded at rest and for everycombination of gait and head and neck position duringexercise. There was a significant correlation between thegrade of laryngeal function during exercise and at rest bothbefore (correlation coefficient = 0.794) and after (correlationcoefficient = 0.741) sedation (P <0.01). No significant association was found between the grade of laryngealfunction during exercise and the different head and neckpositions. Introduction Respiratory dysfunction is a frequent cause of poorperformance in athletic horses. Recurrent laryngealneuropathy (RLN) is one of the most common forms ofdynamic upper respiratory tract obstructions in bothperformance horses and racehorses (Davidson and Martin2003; Franklin et al 2006; Barakzai 2007; Desmaizieres et al . 2009). Laryngeal function at rest usually gives an indication oflaryngeal function during exercise (Hammer et al . 1998; Martin et al . 2000; Lane et al . 2006a). Barakzai and Dixon (2011) were able to show a significant correlation between restinglaryngeal function score using the Havemeyer grading system(Dixon et al . 2003) and exercising grades of laryngeal function in horses undergoing high-speed treadmill endoscopy.However, a number of studies have documented thatendoscopy during exercise is required for a definite diagnosisof dynamic upper respiratory tract obstructions (Kannegieterand Dore 1995; Martin et al . 2000; Lane 2006a). High-speed treadmill endoscopy has become themost accepted method of investigating dynamic obstructionsof the upper respiratory tract, especially in racing horses. Insport horses, factors other than strenuous workload are moreimportant for diagnostic purposes. These factors includedifferent head-neck positions whose influences are easier toinvestigate during ridden exercise than on a high-speedtreadmill (Barakzai and Cheetham 2012). It has beensuggested that head-neck flexion affects upper airway flow mechanics during exercise. In a study by Petsche et al . (1995), an increased respiratory resistance was found during headflexion compared to a neutral head position. Several theoriesand models trying to explain this phenomenon have beenestablished. Gerring (1985) proposed that head position mayinfluence the airflow in the airway, because the airflow nolonger follows a straight line but has to make its way through adecreasing kink angle (between nasal airway and trachea)with increasing head flexion. Other authors assume that thechanges in shape and size of the upper airway are dependenton alteration of the head position (Cook 1965; Petsche et al . 1995). This theory has been supported by studies illustratingthat head-neck flexion causes a reduction in the dorsoventraldiameter of the nasopharynx on lateral radiographs in horsesat al unpublished data). Therefore, head-neck flexion is suspectedto induce or deteriorate disorders of the upper respiratory tract(Allen et al . 2011; van Erck-Westergren 2011). The purpose of the present study was to investigate the relationship between laryngeal function at rest and duringexercise in Warmblood sport horses and to examine theinfluence of different head-neck positions on laryngealfunction during exercise. Materials and methods Fifty-eight German Warmblood horses (39 geldings, 16 maresand 3 stallions) aged 3-20 years free of cardiovascular ormusculoskeletal disease were included in the study. Thirty-six ofthese horses, owned by clients, were presented at theuniversity for evaluation of an abnormal respiratory noise and/or poor performance (respiratory noise = 27, poor performance = 3, both = 6); 9 horses were owned by theuniversity and 13 horses were owned by the Hanoverianmounted police unit. The horses' usual working disciplinesincluded dressage (n = 16), showjumping (n = 20) and pleasureriding (n = 22). All horses were subjected to a physicalexamination, and an endoscopic examination was performedat rest and during ridden exercise. Endoscopic examination at rest Endoscopic examinations (Olympus Evis Exera II)1were carried out at rest rest, during nasal occlusion andafter swallowing. Arytenoid function before and after sedation contributed equally to this work.41 \u00a9 2013 EVJ LtdEQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JANUARY 2014was graded independently by 3 observers based on the internationally used Havemeyer grading system for laryngeal function, first published by Dixon et al . (2003). For further analysis, median values of the laryngeal grades assigned by the 3 observers were used. Endoscopic examination during exercise For the endoscopic examination during exercise, theendoscope was inserted following a warm-up period. After the horses had become accustomed to the Dynamic Respiratory Scope 3they were subjected to a standardised exercise test. Abnormal respiratory sounds occurring during the examination were documented. The exercise test included performance at trot and canter in 4 different head-neck positions ( reference , elevation ,hyperflexion and unrestrained ) as shown in Fig 1 . Thereference position was defined as the position in which the riders presented their horses as they would train them at home during the warm-up phase. Ideally, a posture with a lowneck and the ridge of the nose slightly in front of the vertical plane should have been achieved, independent of the horses' usual working disciplines. For the head-neck position elevation , the riders were asked to present their horses with the poll being the highest point and the ridge of the nose slightly infront of the vertical plane. In the head-neck position termed hyperflexion the horses should be adjusted as low and overbent as they would perform willingly without resistanceagainst the rider. To achieve the unrestrained head-neck position the riders were to loosen the reins until there was no longer a connection between the rider's hand and the bit. Allhorses were examined according to the following scheme: trotreference, trot elevation, trot hyperflexion, canter reference, canter hyperflexion and trot unrestrained.The exercise test took 20-25 min, with each combination of gait and head-neck position lasting about 3 min. For every combination of gait and head-neck position, endoscopy anda lateral video of horse and rider were digitally recorded along2 long sides of the indoor arena, which was 40 m long. The timelines of the 2 videos were synchronised and the lateral video of the horse and rider was used to determine the pointin time from which a combination of gait and head-neck position started. By means of the lateral video, head-neckposition was checked by one author (L.G.) for correct execution and was rated correct, if it could be classified into one of the positions (reference, elevation, hyperflexion and unrestrained) defined as described above. If the required head-neck position was not performed in an adequate way orwas inconsistent during the sequence, the data from this horse for this position were excluded from further analysis. The endoscopic videos were evaluated in real time and, if required, in slow motion. Laryngeal function was graded for every combination of gait and head-neck position into one of 7 categories. For this purpose, the scoring system from Rakestraw et al . (1991) was modified ( Table 1 ) to allow a more precise classification. Data analysis As the laryngeal function scores at rest and during riddenexercise cannot be treated as interval scaled and, in addition, data could not be transformed into normal distribution, the nonparametric tests of SPSS statistic version 20 4were applied. The endoscopic grades of laryngeal function at rest were tested for interobserver agreement using Cronbach's as intraclass correlation coefficient. The Spearman- Rho coefficient was used to check for possible correlation between the laryngeal function score during exercise andthe score at rest with and without sedation respectively. The Wilcoxon test for paired samples was used to check for differences in the distribution of laryngeal function scores during ridden exercise between the different gaits and head-neck positions. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to assessdifferences in laryngeal function score during exercisebetween the 3 working disciplines (dressage, showjumping and pleasure riding), and between horses with and without anabnormal respiratory noise, respectively. Significance was set at P <0.05. Horses were divided into 3 groups (A, B, C) depending on their laryngeal function score in the reference position at trotto show the distribution of laryngeal function score in the othergait and head-neck positions for each of these groups. Results There was substantial agreement between the endoscopicscores at rest given by the 3 observers ( = 0.958 before sedation and = 0.936 after sedation). Two horses were examined at rest only without sedation. Fifty-four of theremaining 56 cases (96.4%) were rated the same (n = 28) orassigned a lower score (n = 25) without sedation than with sedation. The median values of the laryngeal function scoreswithout and with sedation at rest were significantly different (P<0.05). The distributions of the grades for laryngeal function at rest before and after sedation as well as during exercise forall horses are shown in Table 2 . The Spearman-Rho correlation coefficient between evaluation of laryngeal function without sedation at rest and evaluation of laryngeal function during exercise was 0.794(P<0.01); that between rating of laryngeal function with sedation at rest and rating of laryngeal function during exercise was 0.741 (P <0.01). For the total of 58 horses, the distributions of laryngeal function scores during exercise were not significantly differentbetween the investigated head-neck positions within the same gait. However, the distributions of grades between trot and canter were significantly different (P <0.05), independent of head-neck positions.

There was no significant difference in laryngeal function scores during exercise between the working disciplinesdressage and showjumping. Compared to these 2 groupsthe group of pleasure riding showed a significantly higherscore. Thirty-four out of 58 horses (58.6%) had an abnormal respiratory noise during the exercise test. These horses weresignificantly (P <0.05) more often diagnosed with a left-sided laryngeal dysfunction during exercise than horses without anabnormal respiratory noise. During the exercise test, 7 combinations of head and neck positions and gaits have been requested. Forty-seven out of 58horses (81%) fulfilled all demanded requirements correctly. Theremaining 11 horses (19%) failed at least in one of the 7 combinations (7/11 in one combination and 4/11 in more thanone). Overall, 15 combinations (15/406; 3.7%) were rated asnot correctly performed. The combination canter-elevationwas found to be incorrectly implemented in 8 cases (53%),canter-hyperflexion in 3 cases (20%), trot-elevation in 2 cases(13.3%) and one case (6.6%) each in the combinationtrot-hyperflexion and trot-unrestrained respectively. Apart from laryngeal dysfunctions, the following upper airway obstructions occurred during the exercise test: axialdeviation of the aryepiglottic fold (n = 1), dorsal displacementof the soft palate (n = 5) and pharyngeal collapse (n = 5). Eighthorses (14%) were diagnosed with more than one upperairway abnormality. Due to the few cases, a statement aboutthe relationship between head-neck position and theoccurrence of these upper airway obstructions could not bedrawn.TABLE 1: Modified scoring system of laryngeal function from Rakestraw et al .

It should be noted that inthe study by van Erck-Westergren (2011), the degree of pollflexion was not standardised and is only described as anincreased head and neck flexion in comparison to free headcarriage. In the present study, only head-neck positions inwhich the horses performed willingly without resistance to therider were investigated. Therefore, the possibility that anenforced overbending - as presently discussed in theequestrian community - may influence laryngeal functioncould not be ruled out. Furthermore, in the study by vanErck-Westergren (2011) the horses were first ridden with theirheads free and afterwards with increased head and neckflexion, whereas in the present study the free head positionwas investigated at the end of the exercise test. Therefore, theintensity and duration of the exercise test and the resultingfatigue are aspects that should be taken into accountregarding the different results of the 2 studies. The hypothesis that alterations in head-neck position may influence morphology and function of the upper airway isbased on the assumption that increasing flexion of the headand neck leads to a decreasing diameter of the upper airway(Cook 1965; Petsche et al . 1995). As a consequence, the resistance to airflow increases and hence the absolute valueof the intraluminal negative pressure during inhalation,especially in exercising horses, increases. The extent to which achange in diameter influences airflow and pressure conditionsinside the upper airway is still not completely clarified. Since the equine upper airway is not a circular tube of uniformdiameter and airflow within it is turbulent, Rakesh et al . (2008a) came up with a new approach, showing that the radius of asection of the upper airway affects the impedance to thepower of 0.85. However, this equation applies only for achange in radius in a section of the upper airway and should not be applied to the entire upper respiratory tract. Previous research has already demonstrated that head-neck positions affect the pharyngeal diametermeasured in sedated horses at (Linford et al . 1983; Cehak et al . 2010), and in a recent study we could confirm that head-neck position also affects the pharyngeal diameter ofhorses during exercise (Go et al . unpublished data). Furthermore, increased head-neck flexion is suspected to increase the risk of the likelihood of pharyngeal wall collapse(Smith et al . 1994; Barton et al . 2009) and promotes the development of palatal instability (Boyle et al . 2006). Head-neck flexion is even considered to be responsible for inducing bilateral arytenoid cartilage and vocal fold collapse,which has been reported in Norwegian Coldblooded Trotters(Strand et al . 2004; Fjordbakk et al . 2008) and in a case report about an Icelandic Horse (Hanche-Olsen 2010). Recent investigations about the influence of head-neck flexion on the area of the laryngeal opening have shown thatthis area is significantly smaller in hyperflexion in comparison tothe normal contact position in ridden sport horses (Gehlenet al . 2011). It should be noted that in the cited study it was not taken into account that a modification of head-neck positionmay result in a change of distance between the endoscopeand the larynx as well as in the viewing angle and hence couldaffect the measured laryngeal opening. In the present study,the association between the alteration of head-neck positionTABLE 4: Laryngeal function score in relation to the different head-neck positions and gaits for all horses diagnosed grade B (n = 23) in reference position at trot Gait and head-neck positionLaryngeal function during exercise AB 1B 2B 3C 1C 2C 3 Trot reference - 15 7 1 - - - Trot unrestrained 3 12 4 2 1 - -Trot elevation 1 15 6 1 - - - Trot hyperflexion 2 12 8 - 1 - -Canter reference 2 6 13 1 1 - -Canter elevation 1 9 10 1 - 1 -Canter hyperflexion 1 10 9 1 - 1 - TABLE 5: Laryngeal function score in relation to the different head-neck positions and gaits for all horses diagnosed grade C (n = 10) in reference position at trot Gait and head-neck positionLaryngeal function during exercise AB 1B 2B 3C 1C 2C 3 Trot reference - - - - 6 4 - Trot unrestrained - - 1 - 3 6 - Trot elevation - - 2 - 4 3 1Trot hyperflexion - - 1 - 2 6 1 Canter reference - - - - - 7 3Canter elevation - - - - - 4 2Canter hyperflexion - - 1 - 1 5 3 \u00a9 2013 EVJ Ltd44 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE function was analysed. Since the utilised grading system is essentially based on laryngeal movement itcan be assumed that the angle at which the assessedstructures are viewed and the distance between theendoscope and the larynx has no influence on the grading of laryngeal function. In the present study, a significant difference between the laryngeal function score in the 2 investigated gaits could bedemonstrated. This could be explained by the generallyaccepted fact that with increasing physical workload, thebreathing and airflow pattern changes as well. It has been postulated by some authors that rider's intervention has a significant effect on the morphology andstability of the upper airway, with head-neck flexion being themain contributing factor causing dynamic collapse of theupper airway or leading to deterioration of existing pathologies (Davidson et al . 2002; Franklin et al . 2006; Allen et al . 2011; van Erck-Westergren 2011). In terms of laryngeal function, this could not be confirmed by the present study. A conceivable explanation could be that the head-neck position has a bigger impact on pharyngeal than on laryngealstability. This hypothesis is based on the fact that the larynx, incontrast to the pharynx, is supported by cartilaginousstructures. In addition, the cross-section area of the fullyabducted larynx is 7% greater than that of the trachea and amaximal abduction of the arytenoid cartilages may not benecessary for sufficient ventilation (Rakesh et al . 2008b). Furthermore, it is possible that the soft tissue boundaries of thepharynx are stretched longitudinally during atlanto-occipitalextension, whereas these tissues are less stretched in a moreflexed head-neck position (Cook 1965; Strand et al . 2009). As a result, the pharyngeal walls bulge inwards, partly due to thereduced stretching, but also as a consequence of theanatomical characteristics of the head. Since the deepmuscles of M. pterygoideus medialis and M. the intermandibular space ( M. digastricus ) are laterally limited by the mandible, these structures can only evade medially if theyare less stretched or even compressed during increasedhead-neck flexion. As shown by McCluskie et al . (2008), head position significantly affects the position of the larynx in such away that flexed head position results in rostral advancement ofthe larynx. This indicates that the structures of the upperrespiratory tract are laterally restricted and are compressed inthe longitudinal axis (concerning the sagittal plane) duringhead-neck flexion. It is well known that, apart from racehorses, performance horses are never required to reach the point of maximalventilation coupled with complete physical exhaustion (Morris1991). The results of the present study demonstrate that themost critical factor for diagnosing a laryngeal malfunction insport horses is replicating their usually required level of work. Asmost of the presented horses had a history of an abnormalrespiratory noise during their routine type of work, theprevalence of laryngeal dysfunction (81%) in the present studywas very high despite the fact that the horses were notexercised to the point of fatigue. Previous studies, which alsoinvestigated horses with abnormal respiratory noise and/orpoor performance, reported a prevalence of 11-38%(Kannegieter and Dore 1995; Martin et al . 2000; al . 2005; Franklin 2006; Lane et al . 2006b; Barakzai and Dixon 2011). The difference could be explained by the choice ofsubjects. In the present study, only Warmblood horses havebeen included whereas in the other studies mainly racehorses (Thoroughbreds and/or Standardbreds) have been examined.On closer inspection of the studies it becomes apparent thatthe prevalence increases along with the amount of includedWarmblood horses. This confirms the hypothesis that laryngeal dysfunction is the most frequent dynamic upper airway obstruction in Warmblood horses (Davidson and Martin 2003;Davidson et al . 2011). In this study, the group of pleasure riding horses showed a significantly lower laryngeal function score than the other 2groups (dressage and showjumping). It is possible that thesedifferences result from the composition of the aforementionedgroups. Since the group of pleasure horses consisted in themajority of horses not referred as patients (horses owned bythe university or the police unit), a biased distribution could besuspected. Failure of complete abduction of the left arytenoid cartilage at rest is a reliable indicator for dynamic arytenoidcollapse during exercise and has been shown by severalresearchers (Hammer et al . 1998; Martin et al . 2000; Barton et al . 2011). The majority of horses which are able to attain and maintain full arytenoid abduction at rest will be classified asgrade A during exercise (Morris and Seeherman 1990; Morris 1991; Rakestraw et al . 1991). However, in all reports there are some horses with apparently normal laryngeal function at restthat progress to complete laryngeal 1991; Kannegieter and Dore 1995; In the literature, predictions of laryngeal function duringexercise of horses with grade III at rest have been very unreliable. Some authors (Hammer et al . 1998; Martin et al . 2000) discovered that up to 80% of racehorses showing agrade III left laryngeal hemiplegia at rest will have a significant dynamic collapse of the arytenoid during strenuous exercise.Controversially, another author (Rakestraw et al . 1991) published that 80% of the horses with resting grade III were able to maintain full abduction during exercise. Meanwhile, all horses with grade IV left laryngeal hemiplegia at rest were classified as grade C during exercise (Morris and Seeherman 1990; Kannegieter and Dore 1995; van Erck-Westergren 2011). In accordance with previous studies (Morris and Seeherman 1990; Hammer et al . 1998; Lane et al . 2006a; Barton et al . 2011; Davidson et al . 2011), we found a significant correlation between resting laryngeal function grade and thegrade of laryngeal function during exercise. All horsesclassified as grade IV at rest were diagnosed with a grade C laryngeal dysfunction during exercise. Horses with grade IIIB up tograde IIIC laryngeal function at rest were also rated grade Cduring exercise. All horses that showed laryngeal function between grade I and grade IIIA at rest were classified grade A orBduring exercise. The endoscopic examinations at rest were carried out with and without sedation. The ability to abduct fully is alwaysdetermined by comparison between the left and the rightarytenoid cartilage and it can be assumed that both sideswould be affected equally by sedation. It has been suggestedthat sedation may help to clarify endoscopic findings at rest toidentify early stages of L\u00f6bert 2009). As in these studies sedation increased the severity oflaryngeal dysfunction, it has been hypothesised that musclerelaxation induced by the sedatives imitates muscular fatigueinduced by exercise. In accordance with previous studies(Ducharme al . 1991; Lindegaard AE / JANUARY 2014could reproduce an exacerbation of laryngeal function grades with sedation in comparison to the grades withoutsedation. However, as the present study shows, sedation didnot increase the predictive value of resting endoscopy incomparison to the examination during ridden exercise. Consequently, the examiner has free choice of whether or not to use sedation during the endoscopy at rest for the diagnosisof dynamic RLN. Because dynamic RLN could not be predicted with complete certainty by resting endoscopy, evaluation duringexercise should be performed in any case of doubt beforerecommendations for treatment of equine athletes are made.The results of the current study indicate that, concerning theevaluation of laryngeal function, flexion of head and neckduring the exercise examination is not required, since it doesnot influence laryngeal function.

Staroniewicz Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Wrocaw University of Environmental and Life equine viral arteritis (EVA) and infection with or transplacental routes.Horizontal respiratory transmission of EAV results from exposure to infective nasopharyngeal secretions from acutely infected horses. For this transmission to occur, direct and close contactbetween horses is necessary. Venereal infection is an efficientmethod of transmission, with seroconversion of 85 to 100%of seronegative mares bred to virus shedding stallions.Asymptomatic carrier stallions the essential naturalreservoir of equine arteritis virus. Equine herpesviruses-1 and -4infect a susceptible host, replicate and establish a lifelonglatent infection without any associated clinical signs.Reactivation of latent infections can result from factors such asstress and intercurrent disease. The control of these diseases isby implementation of appropriate management and hygienemeasures, supplemented by vaccination and, in the case ofEVA, by the identification of persistently infected stallions,which can be removed from breeding or continue to be bredto if managed under controlled conditions to prevent the risk ofan outbreak of the disease. Introduction Abortion in horses may result from a variety of causes.Infectious agents, such as bacteria, viruses or fungi, may infectthe fetus or its membranes resulting in fetal death andabortion. Other noninfectious factors connected with themare, fetus or external agents may also cause loss of theembryo or fetus. These factors include twinning, congenitaldefects, progesterone or nutritional deficiencies, ergotalkaloid toxicity, umbilical cord torsion and exposure to Easterntent caterpillars. The significant viral causes of abortion includethe following diseases: equine viral arteritis (EVA) and equineherpesvirus-related diseases, which may be due to infectionwith either of 2 closely related herpesviruses: equineherpesvirus-1 viral arteritis is a highly contagious viral infection thatcan cause a high rate of abortion among susceptiblepregnant mares. The disease is caused by equine arteritis virus(EAV). This virus is present in horse populations in manycountries. A significant percentage of stallions may becomecarriers of the virus. Equine arteritis virus was first isolatedfrom the lung of an aborted fetus in 1953 following an outbreakof respiratory disease and abortion on a Standardbredbreeding farm near Bucyrus (Ohio, USA) (Doll et al . 1957a,b).After the isolation of the causative agent and description of characteristic vascular lesions, the virus was called equine arteritis virus (Jones et al . 1957). Aetiology Equine arteritis virus is a member of the Arteriviridae family (Van Regenmortel et al . 2000). Virions are 60 nm in diameter with an isometric nucleocapsid of about 35 nm in diameter,surrounded by a lipid envelope which possess 12-15 nmring-like surface structures. They contain a single molecule oflinear, positive-sense RNA (De Vries et al arteritis virus is readily inactivated by lipid solvents and by commondisinfectants and detergents. Under laboratory conditions, EAV(Bucyrus strain) can retain infectivity in a tissue culture mediumfor>75 days at 4\u00b0C, for 2-3 days at 37\u00b0C and for 20-30 min at 56\u00b0C (Konishi et al . 1975). Epidemiology Serological surveys have shown that EAV occurs in Europe, North and South America, Africa, Asia and Australia (Timoneyand McCollum 1993a). The seroprevalence of EAV infectionvaries between countries and also among horses of differentbreed and age (Timoney and McCollum 1988; Golnik andSordyl 2004). Differences in the seroprevalence between different horse breeds may indicate the importance of the host genotype forsusceptibility to infection. Relatively high seroprevalence insome horse breeds may be connected with specificmanagement practices which increase the risk of exposure tothe virus (Crabb and Studdert 1996). In spite of its worldwide circulation, EAV causes disease outbreaks only from time to time (Timoney andMcCollum 1993b). The conspicuous difference between theubiquitousness of the virus and recorded outbreaks of thedisease may indicate a lack of knowledge on the part ofowners and veterinarians about EVA, limitations in accessiblediagnostics, confusion with another equine disease andsubclinical infection with EAV. The increasing number ofconfirmed outbreaks of EVA in the 1990s can be relatedto increased international horse transport and use ofartificial insemination in the equine industry (Crabb andStuddert 1996). Pathogenesis The pathogenesis of EVA is still not entirely clear. Many of theclinical manifestations of EVA result from vascular injury(Balasuriya and MacLachlan 2007). After infection,multiplication of virus is known to take place in alveolarmacrophages and sites in the upper respiratory tract. The virus48 \u00a9 2013 EVJ LtdEQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JANUARY 2014migrates to the bronchial lymph nodes where further replication takes place and the virus is disseminatedthroughout the body via the blood stream. The following tissuesites are secondary locations of virus replication: the epitheliaof adrenals, kidneys, seminiferous tubules, liver and the thyroid, and the mesothelium and cells of the tunica media (Breese and McCollum 1973; Timoney and McCollum 1993b).Localisation of EAV may involve the endothelium and medialmyocytes (Del Piero et al . 1997). Damage of endothelial cells could lead to anoxia and thrombosis (Estes and Cheville 1970).Equine arteritis virus is not detected beyond 28 days afterinfection other than from semen of carrier stallions (Timoneyet al . 1986b; Neu et al . 1988). The pathogenesis of EAV abortion is not fully known and some different, but not mutually exclusive mechanisms, havebeen proposed to explain EAV. One of the oldest theories proposed is that abortion is the result of a lethal fetal infection not connected with the dam because it usually coincides withearly maternal convalescence (Doll et al . 1957b). Other authors suggest that abortion results from damaged uterineand placental blood supply because of systemic vascularnecrosis in the mare (Jones et al . 1957). According to another theory, abortion is the result of a fetal infection which leads todeath rather than myometritis or a placental damage thatimpairs progesterone synthesis, leading to fetal expulsion(Coignoul and Cheville 1984). MacLachlan et al . (1996) contend that fetal stress and subsequent activation of thefetal hypothalamic-pituitary axis, as a consequence of viralinfection of the developing fetus, might contribute to thepathogenesis of EVA-induced abortion. Transmission Transmission of EAV occurs through respiratory, venereal ortransplacental routes. Horizontal respiratory transmission of EAV is the result of exposure to infective nasopharyngeal secretions from acutelyinfected horses. These secretions can be highly infectious, withtitres of EAV for some 7-14 days during the acute phase ofinfection (McCollum et al . 1971). For this transmission to occur, direct and close contact between horses is necessary(Timoney and McCollum 1988). Blood, lacrimal fluid, urine,faeces, vaginal secretions and aborted fetus, placenta andamniotic fluid may also contribute to horizontal virus spread(Fukunaga et al . 1981; Cole et al . 1986). Horizontal infection poses a threat to pregnant mares, which can result in abortion(de Vries et al . 1996). The other important route of natural transmission of the virus is venereal transmission of EAV throughthe use of semen from an EAV carrier stallion. Most acutely andall persistently infected stallions shed virus in semen and maybe a source of infection through breeding or indirect contactwith stallion masturbates (Neu et al . 1988; B\u00fcrki et al . 1992). Venereal infection is an efficient means of transmission withseroconversion of 85-100% of seronegative mares bred toshedding stallions (Timoney et al . 1986a). Mares can also be infected by artificial insemination with infective semen(Balasuriya et al . 1998). However, venereal transmission from acutely infected mares to stallions has not been proven (DeVries et al . 1996). Transplacental transmission of the virus in mares infected in late gestation may result in a foal withcongenitally acquired EAV infection. These fulminating interstitial pneumonia andfibronecrotic enteritis; however, the virus is not teratogenic(Timoney and McCollum 1993b). Transmission earlier in gestation can result in abortion (Golnik et al . 1981; Del Piero et al . 1997). Asymptomatic carrier stallions are the principal natural reservoir of EAV. Persistently infected stallions can be dividedinto 3 categories on the basis of the duration of thevirus shedding (Timoney et al . 1987). The short-term or convalescent carriers shed the virus in semen for 2-5 weeks, anintermediate carrier state lasts for 3-8 months and long-term orchronic carriers contain the virus in their sperm for years and perhaps even for life (Timoney and McCollum 1993b) Some persistently infected horses cease to shed virus after periodsbetween 18 months and 10 years with no apparent reversionlater to a shedding state (Timoney and McCollum 1993b). Themechanism of persistence of EAV in the male reproductivetract is unknown, but it appears to be testosterone-dependent(Little et al . 1992). Persistently infected stallions castrated and treated with testosterone continued to shed the virus in semen as opposed to untreated animals (Little et al . 1992). The virus has not been isolated from the reproductive tract of mareslater than one month after infection or from convalescentmares (McCollum and Timoney 1984). Clinical features Most natural infections are asymptomatic (McCollum andBryans 1973) or pyrexia of up to 41\u00b0C occurs. In addition, anycombination of the following clinical signs can be observed:anorexia, depression, conjunctivitis and respiratory signs withrhinitis, mammary glands. Sometimes urticarial rash of are present. Less frequently, ataxia, mucosalpapular eruptions, shoulder oedema and submaxillarylymphadenopathy have been observed (Del Piero 2000). Innatural cases of EVA, the clinical signs can vary significantlyamong individual horses and between outbreaks and dependon factors such as the age and physical condition of the horse,route of infection, challenge dose, environmental conditionsand strain of virus (Slater 2007). In adult horses the course ofdisease is rarely fatal. Pregnant mares which have hadcontact with infective respiratory tract secretions from acutelyinfected horses can frequently abort. Abortion rates varybetween <10% and >50% (Timoney and McCollum 1993b) and generally occurs 10-33 days after EAV infection. It isconnected with the late febrile or early convalescent phasebut it can occur even if no clinical signs are observed (Bryanset al . 1957). Frequently, but not invariably, aborted fetuses are partially autolysed and do not show any gross andmicroscopic lesions (De Vries et al . 1996), whereas EHV-infected fetuses are expelled fresh and frequently havecharacteristic gross lesions (Holyoak et al . 2008). EHV-1 and EHV-4 infection Before 1981, EHV-4 and EHV-1 were known as the same virus, namely 'EHV-1', for which the synonyms 'equinerhinopneumonitis virus' and 'equine 'EHV-1' causedrespiratory disease (equine rhinopneumonitis), establishedlatent infection and subsequently as anunpredictable sequel following reactivation of latency inpregnant mares. It was assumed likewise in the case ofoccurrence of EHV-1 neurological disease (Crabb andStuddert VETERINARY AE / JANUARY 2014The result of restriction endonuclease DNA fingerprints (Sabine et al . 1981; Studdert et al . 1981; Turtinen et al 1981) revealed that what had been designated 'EHV-1' reallycomprised 2 different viruses. In 1988, The Herpesvirus StudyGroup of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) accepted the proposal for the viruses to be designated EHV-1 and -4 (Turtinen et al . 1981). Aetiology EHV-1 and -4 are related members of the Alphaherpesviridae family and responsible for abortion and neurological disease (Campbell and Studdert 1983; Allen and Bryans 1986; Crabb et al . 1995). Virions are about 150 nm in a diameter with complex and characteristic structures and include bothsymmetric and nonsymmetric components (Homa and a core, capsid, tegumen,and lipoprotein envelope. The core consists of the viralgenome, a single, linear, double stranded (ds) DNA molecule(Van Regenmortel et al . 2000). EHV-1 and -4 are closely related but are genetically, antigenically and pathogenitically different from EHV-2, -3 and -5 EHV-1 and -4 are environmentally labile and quickly destroyed by lipid solvents, heat, detergents and disinfectants(Doll et al . 1959a). Environmental persistence of EHV is relatively short, estimated to be below 7 days in mostconditions with a maximum survival of 35 days (Doll et al . 1959b). Epidemiology The main reservoir of EHV is the latently infected horse. Equineherpesvirus-1 most often causes abortion in mares, whileEHV-4 is usually associated with respiratory disease in younghorses. Although both viruses have the potential to causerespiratory disease, abortion and equine herpesvirusmyeloencephalopathy (EHM), cases of EHV-4 related abortion and neurological disease are rare (Slater 2007). Epidemiological research indicates that primary infection is acquired within the first few weeks or months of life, usuallybefore or just after weaning, from adult mares that exhibit noclinical signs of disease and shed virus (Gilkerson et al . 1999). The life styles of EHV-1 and -4 are represented by 1) early and widespread infection of young horses, 2) a highprevalence of latently infected carrier horses and 3)transmission of virus from latently infected adults to newgenerations of equines (Slater 2007). Pathogenesis The upper respiratory tract is the natural gateway of entry forEHV-1 and -4 and the respiratory mucosal epithelium is themain target for infection (Allen and Bryans 1986; Gibson et al . 1992; Allen et al . 2004). Close physical contact with a horse, that shed virus or inhalation of infectious aerosol maycontribute to respiratory infection. The efficacy of respiratorytransmission and active spread of herpesvirus infections is lessthan that observed with equine influenza virus (Allen 2002b). Primary EHV-1 replication occurs in epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract and local lymph nodes resulting in aleucocyte-associated viraemia, which can persist for at least14 days (Patel al . 1982; Kydd et This leucocyte-associated viraemia in an acute infection hasbeen shown to be a precondition for abortion by initiatingreplication of EHV-1 in endothelial cells of blood vessels in the pregnant uterus. It is likely that this mechanism also occurs inabortions which occur long after an acute primary infectioncaused by reactivated virus from latently infected leucocytes(Patel et al . 1982; Smith et al . 1993). Detection of EHV-1 in an aborted fetus is sometimes more difficult in cases where thereis widespread infection of endometrial blood vessels resulting in a severe vasculitis and multifocal thrombosis than in cases of less extensive uterine vascular pathology. In the latter situation,the virus can transfer across the uteroplacental barrier and it is possible to detect it in the aborted fetus. If transplacental EHV-1 infection occurs near term, the foals can be born alive,but usually die a few days later from a fulminent interstitialpneumonia (Smith et al . 1992, 1993). Uterine endothelial cells are more susceptible to infection with EHV-1 in late pregnancy compared with early pregnancy , so mares abort usually at 6-11 months of gestation (Bryans1978; Slater 2007). This is related to the level of hormones such as serotonin, thromboxanes, prostaglandins and serum gonadotropin in the pregnant mare (Robinson and Maxie1993). Hormonal stability of the placenta in response tovascular injury in early gestation can be reason of resistanceof the pregnant mare to EHV-1 abortion during this time(Edington et al . 1991). Some investigations showed that plasma fibrinogen, factor VIII:C and Von Willebrand factoractivity gradually increase from mid-gestation to delivery innormal mares and this may contribute to thrombosis invirus-infected endometrial endothelium and enhance the riskof abortion in the final third of pregnancy (Gentry et al . 1992). In cases of abortion which occur up to 6 months, the fetuses are usually autolysed. Tissue from aborted fetusesshows a range of macroscopic and microscopic lesions. In lateabortions (after 7 months) lesions are visible in about 25% of thecases (Doll and Bryans 1962). In comparison to EHV-1, EHV-4 has a much lower endotheliotropism. Most EHV-4 strains do not give rise to acell-associated viraemia and consequently, rarely causeabortion or neurological disease (Patel et al . 1982). However, some isolates of EHV-4 have the capacity to cause acell-associated viraemia and can replicate in uterine and/orfetal endothelial cells and cause abortion (Whitwell et al . 1994). Usually EHV-4 infections are cleared from the respiratory tract after 7-20 days post primary infection and within 2-7 daysof subsequent infections (Allen et al . 2004). The actual pathogenesis of EHV-4 infection has not been fullydetermined. It is similar to EHV-1 because the early mucosalphase is connected with infection of the respiratory tract andits associated lymphoid system. Finally, viral DNA can persist inthe trigeminal ganglia, certain subpopulations of circulatinglymphocytes and reticuloendothelial cells associated with therespiratory tract, following recovery from infection (Welchet al herpesviruses-1 and -4 are capable of staying dormant in a carrier horse for a long time, probably for life, without anyassociated clinical signs. On large equine breedingestablishments, EHV-1 infection occurs in the first weeks ormonths of life and current vaccines and control practicescannot prevent this occurring (Gilkerson et al . 1999). Latency in infected horses is established in lymph nodes associatedwith the respiratory tract, CD8+ T lymphocytes and in neurons \u00a9 2013 EVJ Ltd50 trigeminal ganglia (Pusterla et al . 2010). Viral DNA can also be detected in other locations, but it is unknownwhether the virus is capable of undergoing reactivation fromthese sites (Nordengrahn et al . 2002). Influence of factors such as stress, transport, co-mingling of horses and intercurrent disease, can lead to reactivation of latent infection (Edington et al . 1985). Reactivation of EHV-1 may result in mild respiratory disease (Kydd et al . 1994) and if it occurs in mares which have not previously aborted an EHV-1 infected fetus, they mayabort (Campbell and Studdert 1983). It may take place weeksor months post infection, after the period of thecell-associated viraemia that follows virus reactivation fromthe trigeminal ganglia within the et al . 1998). Reactivation of latent EHV-4 will usually cause recurrent disease in the host accompanied by virusshedding from the nasopharynx in the absence of clinical signs (Allen et al . 2004). A recent study conducted in the USA among a healthy horse population, demonstrated that subclinical shedding ofEHV-1 is rare and when it does occur it is at a very low level thatmight not pose an infectious disease threat to other horses(Pusterla et al . 2008). These observations contrast with the paradigm of common subclinical transmission of EHV-1, atleast in the absence of neonatal and juvenile horsepopulations and imply that a spread of EHV-1 among adulthorses is typically accompanied by clinical disease (Lunn et al . 2009). However, the Australian studies report a silent cycle ofEHV-1 transmission and do suggest that mares are the sourceof this virus, in the absence of outbreaks of disease (Gilkersonet al . 1999). Transmission Equine herpesviruses-1 and -4 can spread via the respiratory route, through contact with an infected animal or abortedfetus, via contaminated equipment or via handler's clothingand hands (Kydd et al . 1994) The most common transmission route is via the respiratory tract by aerosolised respiratorysecretions. Infection can also occur by inhalation of dropletsfrom surfaces or by ingestion. All horses with clinical diseaseand horses in which reactivation of latency has taken placeare considered to be infectious by the respiratory route, evenvirus-shedding adult horses may exhibit no clinical signs.Aborted foals, placental fluids and fetal membranes containlarge quantities of virus and are especially hazardous (Slater2007). can also infect conjunctival epithelium, probablythrough al . infected pony foals and pony stallions, EHV-1 wasfound in the epididymis and testis. Semen of these horses canbe source of the virus even after the cessation of viraemia(17-25 days after infection) (Tearle et al . 1996). Clinical features Abortion It has been reported that pregnant mares abort suddenly, without any evidence of previous respiratory tract infection,14-120 days after exposure (Doll and Bryans 1962; Smith et al . 1992). Abortion caused by EHV-1 may be sporadic or result inmultiple abortions ('abortion storms'). Abortion rates in suchsituations can reach (Doll and Bryans 1963; Mumfordet al . 1987; Smith et al . 1996). Abortion may occur when the mare is still standing or soon after lying down. The fetus is often still enveloped in its amnioticmembrane and is usually expelled together with the placenta (Allen et al . 2004). Sometimes, fetuses are born alive, but suffer from respiratory distress. Progression of the disease is rapid and can be accompanied by other signs such as pyrexia, leucopenia, hypoxia, lethargy and diarrhoea. Affected foalsfail to nurse, exhibit severe respiratory distress and eventually die within 10-14 days (Allen et al . 2004; Slater 2007). The reproductive potential of a mare that has aborted is notadversely affected. The majority of mares can becomepregnant a short time after aborting and foal normally in thefollowing year. Accordingly, EHV-1 infection rarely is a cause ofabortion in successive years. Infrequently, however, mares canbecome reinfected and abort again (Bryans 1969; Allen et al . 2004). Occasionally, EHV-4 is a cause of abortion. Clinical signsof such abortions are similar to those of EHV-1 abortion, butabortion storms caused by EHV-4 have not been recorded(Allen et al . 2004). EHV-1 is generally cleared from the respiratory tract within 3 weeks of primary infection and 1-2 weeks followingsubsequent infections (Gibson et al . 1992). The duration of nasal shedding of EHV-4 is usually more transient than for EHV-1 (Slater 2007). Respiratory disease Equine herpesvirus-1, in comparison to EHV-4, is not socommonly found to be the cause of clinically apparentrespiratory disease (Wood et al . 2005). Both viruses generally cause disease limited to the upper respiratory tract, but inimmunocompromised, neonatal and other na\u00efve younganimals, these viruses can also cause severe lower respiratorytract infection which can lead to secondary bacterialbronchopneumonia. These foals develop progressive disease,with depression, tachypnoea, dyspnoea and pyrexia (Slater2007). In previously infected horses, respiratory signs may bemild and duration of illness may be short-lived (Kydd et al . 1994). In older horses, clinical signs may be entirely absent. Thisapplies especially to pregnant mares and mature horses thatdevelop neurological disease which may not show anyrespiratory signs before abortion or onset of neurologicaldysfunction (Goehring et al . 2005). Similarly, reactivation of latent EHV-1 or -4 usually results in asymptomatic virus sheddingand viraemia of limited duration (Slater 2007). Neurological disease Equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM) is becomingmore frequent and can disease (Kohn andFenner 1987). Equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy is notrestricted by pregnancy, age, or gender and can occur in allcategories of horses (Greenwood and Simson 1980). It isassumed that transmission is via the respiratory route althoughendogenous reactivating virus may also be a source ofinfection. Neurological signs usually occur during, or towardsthe end of, the viraemic phase of infection, similar to thepathogenesis of abortion. Neurological signs are highlyvariable in range and severity and depend on the extent andlocation of the neurological lesions in the spinal cord and kindof lesion (Goehring et al . 2005; EHV-1 and EHV-4 Equine arteritis virus Antibodies to EAV can be detected by a virus neutralisation test (VNT), complement fixation test (CF) or enzyme-linked \u00a9 2013 EVJ EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JANUARY 2014immunosorbent assay (ELISA) within a week after infection (Fukunaga and McCollum 1977). Neutralising antibodiesgenerally persist for years and it is believed immunity againstthe disease is long-lasting, if not lifelong (Gerber et al . 1978). A neutralisation antibody dilution titre of 1:4 or greater is regarded as positive. For virus isolation, the rabbit kidney (RK-13) line is routinely used. Virus is very frequently isolated onfirst or second passage in cell culture (Timoney 2012);development of cytopathic effect (CPE) in inoculated cells presence of the virus. Immunofluorescence, immunoperoxidase staining or neutralisation tests are needed to confirm the identity of a viralisolate. For detection of nucleic acid, reverse -4 The diagnosis or -4 infection can be by PCR, virusisolation or by fluorescent antibody testing. Specimens for virusisolation are usually placenta, lung, spleen, liver and kidney ofan aborted fetus which, after preparation of a tissuesuspension, are inoculated onto equine or rabbit monolayercell cultures. If the virus is present, CPE is visible within 24-48 hpost injection at which time infected cells are harvested andPCR on electron microscopy (EM) used to identify the virus asa herpesvirus. To determine the identity of the virus either PCR(Kirisawa et al . 1993), ELISA (Yeargan et al . 1985) or DNA fingerprint (Studdert 1983) can be used. Serological testing, which demonstrates a 4-fold or higher increase in serum antibody titre by VNT or CF test, on acuteand samples 7-21 days apart,provides presumptive evidence of EHV infection (Kydd et al . 2006). The drawback of serological tests such as VN, CF is thefact that they do not distinguish between antibodies to EHV-1or EHV-4; however, commercially available ELISA kits forexample Svanovir EHV-1/EHV-4-Ab ELISA 1are able to differentiate antibodies to from those due to EHV-4(Crabb and Studdert 1993; G\u00fcr and Yapici and EHV-1 and EHV-4 Equine viral arteritis Carrier stallions have a significant role in the maintenance and spread of EAV infection in breeding populations. Outbreaks ofEAV can be prevented through identification of persistentlyinfected stallions and implementation of managementpractices to avert the introduction of EAV-infected horses.Stallions should be tested to determine their serological statusfor antibodies to EAV. If stallions are found serologically positivethey should be tested for presence of the shedding state byvirus isolation in tissue culture, RT-PCR or by test breeding toat least 2 seronegative mares. The mares are tested forthe presence of anti-EAV antibodies 14 and 28 days afterbreeding. Stallions that are confirmed carriers and shedders ofvirus in semen are castrated in some countries, in others theyare kept physically isolated and bred only to naturallyimmunised or vaccinated mares. After being bred to ashedding stallion for the first time, the mare should be isolatedfor 3 weeks from any horses seronegative for antibodies to thevirus. It is important to keep carrier stallions isolated because it avoids the risk of contamination of equipment and premiseswith the virus. If an outbreak of EVA is suspected on a farm, the appropriate veterinary authorities should be notified andaffected and in contact horses isolated. Restrictions ofmovement of horses on and off the affected premises,vaccination of at risk horses and ceasing breeding activity toprevent further spread of the virus should be implemented.Diagnosis of EAV should be confirmed by laboratory testing assoon as possible. Stalls and equipment on the affectedpremises should be thoroughly sanitised with an appropriate disinfectant. Equine arteritis virus is susceptible to chlorine phenolic compounds, iodine and quaternary ammoniumcompounds. Quarantine is lifted when clinical signs of diseaseor serological evidence of infection have not been observedfor at least 3 weeks (Slater 2007). The goals of vaccination against EAV are protection of stallions and 6-12 month old colts against infection and thepossibility of subsequent development of the carrier state,immunisation of seronegative mares before being bredwith EAV-infective semen and reduction of outbreaks innonbreeding populations (Anon. 2012, http://www.aaep.org/eva.html). A modified live-virus attenuated vaccine against EAV (Arvac) 2is available on the market in the USA and Canada. It has also been used in New Zealand, subjectto ministerial controls, as a part of the EVA eradicationprogramme in that country. The second type of vaccine whichis a killed or inactivated vaccine (Equip Artervac, formerlyArtervac) 2is licensed for commercial use in certain European countries, including Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary,Ireland, Sweden and the UK. It is recommended to vaccinatehorses at 3 or more weeks before breeding (Timoney 2012). The vaccination of pregnant mares is not encouraged, particularly during the last 2 months of gestation, unless theyare at risk of a natural exposure (Doll et al . 1968). In some countries, vaccination against EVA is banned because theavailable vaccines do not distinguish between vaccinatedanimals and horses seropositive through natural exposure toinfection. Equine herpesvirus-associated abortion For prevention and control of EHV-1 disease, the followingpractices have been described: prevention of disease entryonto premises; stress reduction; limiting the spread of EHVinfection on a premises and adjacent horse areas andvaccination (Slater 2007). The greatest danger of exogenousinfection is introduction of new horses into established groups.The addition of new animals to the herd should be, if possible,avoided or preceded by a 21 day period of isolation (Allen2002a). For maximum protection, group size should be as small as the physical facilities allow and different age groups shouldnot be mixed. Pregnant mares should be kept separate fromall other horses on the premises and should be subdivided intosmall groups to reduce the risk of outbreaks. Mares in thelast third of pregnancy, when the risk of EHV-1 abortion is thehighest, should be considered most at risk. In case ofsuspected EHV-1 infection, the horse should be isolated andappropriate clinical samples should be collected andimmediately transported to a diagnostic laboratory underchilled (but not frozen) conditions (Allen 2002a; Slater 2007). Alldischarges from the infected horse should be removed and \u00a9 2013 EVJ Ltd52 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JANUARY 2014the area cleaned and disinfected using an appropriate chemical disinfectant. The underlying goal of outbreak controlprocedures is limiting further spread of disease to adjacentpremises and this requires efficient communication amongpremises' owners, veterinarians and other parties working with the affected premises (Allen 2002a; Slater 2007). To minimise the risk of infection in established herds, new arrivals should ideally have been vaccinated before arrivaland should be kept in isolation from other horses until sufficienttime (3-4 weeks) has elapsed for disease to become apparent(Slater 2007). The goal of vaccination against EHV-1 and -4 is to protect horses against respiratory disease and prevent abortion.Although there is limited evidence from the literature of somecross protection between EHV-1 and -4, it is generallyaccepted that in order to enhance the immune responses to EHV, current vaccines should contain both EHV viruses (Minke et al . 2004). The first vaccines against EHV-1 contained inactivated EHV-1 prepared from the tissues of infectedhamsters and were used as a part of a 'planned infection'control programme for immunising mares against abortion inKentucky many years ago (Doll et al . 1959a). The next inactivated vaccines were prepared with different adjuvants(Thompson et al . 1979). They gave only partial clinical and virological protection against respiratory infection with EHV-1and -4 and did not prevent cell-associated viraemia. Despitehigh titres, mares have aborted an infected fetusafter inoculation early in gestation with live virus and thenreinoculation 4-6 months later (Doll et al . 1955; Doll and Bryans 1963). There are now a variety of live combine EHV with other equine disease agents.Immunity after vaccination against reinfection is not longlasting and it is therefore recommended that mares arevaccinated late in gestation in an effort to prevent abortion. Inthe case of an inactivated whole EHV-1/-4 vaccineadjuvanted with carbomer , a 6 month protection period has been previously reported (Minke et al . 2004; Van de Walle et al . 2010). Conclusions Abortogenic viruses are the one of most important causes of abortion in horses. Equine arteritis virus and EHV-1 and -4 canbe responsible for significant economic loses. The control ofthese diseases is through an implementation of appropriatemanagement and hygiene measures and vaccination, thelatter provides relative but not absolute protection againstequine herpesvirus-associated abortion. According to research conducted in central Kentucky during 1988 and 1989 foaling seasons, after the introduction ofwidespread vaccination against EHV-1, the number of fetaland neonatal foal losses decreased significantly (Hong et al . 1993). This is a source of encouragement for breedersto implement systematic vaccination, even thoughvaccination is not wholly efficient; most vaccines do notprevent infection but only reduce the clinical outcome ofinfection. Optimal protection is obtained when regularvaccination is implemented for some years. In the case of EVA,outbreaks can be prevented by systematic testing of horses todetermine their serological status for EAV antibodies. Semen ofseropositive stallions should be investigated virologically todetect virus shedding. Stallions confirmed virus carriers can beremoved from breeding or kept in isolation until their semen no longer tests positive for virus. To reduce the prevalence of EAV infection in horse populations, carrier stallions, which shed thevirus constantly in their semen, should be castrated or usedunder strictly controlled breeding conditions.

Clin. 2013 VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JANUARY 2014GENERALEquine Veterinary Education (EVE) is the official education journal of both the British Equine Veterinary Association (BEVA) and the American Association of Equine Practitioners (AAEP). As such, it is circulated to over 10,000 equine veterinarians around the world. It is published monthly and is a subscription based journal. EVE is an educational journal and we aim to publish material of direct clinical relevance and interest to practising equine clinicians. The educational value of a submitted article is one of the most important criteria that we assess when deciding whether to accept it for publication. Articles do not necessarily need to contain original or novel information but we welcome submission of this material. Currently, the journal publishes the following types of articles: Editorials, Case Reports, Clinical Commentaries, Review Articles, Original Articles, Correspondence and Book Reviews. Papers submitted are assessed by at least two peer reviewers and, if accepted for publication, the copyright becomes the property of EVJ Ltd. Authorship : Authors submitting a paper do so on the understanding that the manuscript has been read and approved by all authors and that all authors agree to the submission of the manuscript to the Journal. ALL named authors must have made an active contribution to the conception and design and/or analysis and interpretation of the data and/or the drafting of the paper and ALL must have critically reviewed its content and have approved the final version submitted for publication. Participation solely in the acquisition of funding or the collection of data does not justify authorship and, except in the case of complex large-scale or multi-centre research, the number of authors should normally not exceed six. Conflict of Interest : Authors are required to disclose any possible conflict of interest. These include financial (for example patent, ownership, stock ownership, consultancies, speaker's fee). Author's conflict of interest (or information specifying the absence of conflicts of interest) will be published under a separate heading entitled: Authors' declaration of interests. Copyright Assignment Authors submitting a paper do so on the understanding that the work and its essential substance have not been published before and is not being considered for publication elsewhere. The submission of the manuscript by the authors means that the authors automatically agree to sign a Copyright Transfer Agreement form when the manuscript is accepted for publication. The work shall not be published elsewhere in any language without the written consent of the publisher. If your paper is accepted, the author identified as the formal corresponding author for the paper will receive an email prompting them to login into Author Services; where via the Wiley Author Licensing Service (WALS) they will be able to complete the license agreement on behalf of all authors on the paper. SUBMISSION OF MANUSCRIPTS Equine Veterinary Education uses ScholarOne Manuscripts for online manuscript submission and peer review. The system has a whole host of benefits including: K\u0001 &E93;\u00011>4\u000151CI\u0001CE2=9CC9?> K\u0001\u00164=9>9CDB1D9?>\u000135>DB1<9C54\u00011>4\u0001B54E354 K\u0001 (97>96931>D\u0001453B51C5\u00019>\u0001@55B\u0001B5F95G\u0001D9=5C All submissions to the journal must be submitted online at http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/eve.

GIF, JPEG, PICT or Bitmap files are acceptable for submission, but only high-resolution TIF or EPS files are suitable for printing. Manuscript Status You can access ScholarOne any time to check your 'Author Centre' for the status of your manuscript. You will be informed by e-mail once a decision has been made. MANUSCRIPT TYPES ACCEPTED Editorials These are often written by the Editors or members of the Editorial Board. However, guest editorials are always welcome. They can relate to the content of the issue, providing a useful means of AUTHOR GUIDELINESintroducing and generating interest in specific subjects. Editorials should be approximately 1000 words and may include a limited number of references.Case Reports Case Reports are published when they are considered to be of educational value. Single or multiple cases are acceptable. They should be presented clearly, with events recorded in chronological order or under headings where appropriate: Introduction, Case history, Clinical findings, Diagnosis, Treatment, Outcome, Post mortem findings (where applicable) and Discussion.The recommended length is 2000 words, although this is dependent upon the nature of the report. Clinical Commentaries The purpose of Clinical Commentaries is to expand on particular aspects of specific Case Reports. Clinical Commentaries provide expert opinion written by a colleague with a special interest and knowledge of the subject. Freedom of expression on any aspect of the Case Report is encouraged. The commentaries are 500-2000 words in length and may contain figures and illustrations where appropriate. Original Articles Original Articles have a high scientific content and contain original work. They may include, for example analyses of data from case series or results of clinical research studies. Articles should be no more than 4000 words in length including references and tables and should include illustrations. A brief summary should be included at the beginning of the article.Review Articles These articles summarise the current knowledge relating to the subject and, in some cases, discuss means of improving understanding. Individual articles can be up to 4000 words long and a full reference list should be supplied. A brief summary should be included at the beginning of the article.Evidence-based clinical questions These should be 800-1000 words and address a clinically relevant question, evaluating it from an evidence-based viewpoint. Correspondence The Editors welcome correspondence on any subject. If a letter relates to an article published in a previous issue, it is usual for a copy to be sent to the author(s) of that article who will be given a chance to respond.Supplementary Information Publication in electronic formats has created opportunities for adding details or whole sections in the electronic version only. Supplementary information can contain data sets, additional figures or tables or video clips which are published alongside the online version of the article. AFTER ACCEPTANCE Upon acceptance of a paper for publication, the manuscript will be forwarded to the Production Editor who is responsible for the production of the journal. Proof Corrections The corresponding author will receive an e-mail alert containing a link to a website. A working e-mail address must therefore be provided for the corresponding author. The proof can be downloaded as a PDF (portable document format) file from this site. Proofs must be returned to the Production Editor within three days of receipt.
