Evolution of Ayurveda and Yoga- A brief knowledge According to modern Ayurvedic sources, the origins of Ayurveda have been traced to around 6,000 BCE when they originated as an oral tradition. Some of the concepts of Ayurveda have existed since the times of Indus Valley Civilization. The first recorded forms of Ayurveda as medical texts evolved from the Vedas. Ayurveda is said to be an eternal science that first existed in the universal consciousness (Brahma) before it was passed from the creator to the ancient Indian mystics through meditation. Having survived and grown through the changes of time, Ayurveda has been acknowledged all across the world backed by scientific evidence. We find mention of [ Lord Dhanvantari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhanvantari) in the history of Ayurveda (in both the Vedas and Puranas). He was the physician of the Gods and an excellent surgeon. It mentions that worshipers pray to Dhanvantari seeking his blessings for sound healing. Though Yoga was being practiced in the pre-Vedic period, the great Sage [Maharshi Patanjali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patanjali) systematized the then existing practices of Yoga, its meaning, and its related knowledge through his Yoga Sutras (aphorisms). [Yoga Sutras of Patanjali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga_Sutras_of_Patanjali) is a collection of 196 short verses that serve as a guide to attain wisdom and self-realization through yoga. The text is estimated to have been written in roughly 400 C.E. and is regarded by many as the basis of yoga philosophy. The 196 sutras are separated into four padas (chapters): Samadhi, Sadhana, Vibhuti, and Kaivalya. The text itself is open to interpretation by the practitioner, but at its core, the Yoga Sutras are intended to provide depth and practical wisdom to help yogis and yoginis explore the central meaning of yoga.

What we do at [ASHAexperience](https://ashaexperience.com) for Ayurveda Health and Yoga- a Complete wellness program - First time in Europe 1. What is Ayurveda? [holistic healing](https://ashaexperience.com)system of the body taking care of both preventive and curative measures within the body. Ayurveda is the science of life that teaches us the way of living in synchronization with the healthy vibes of nature. Ayurveda is a science of Self-healing. By understanding your own unique nature or body constitution, you begin to understand how you interact with your environment and others - thus practicing a healthy lifestyle that will lead you towards self-healing free of ailments or diseases. 2. Why Ayurveda? To understand the importance of Ayurveda, let us understand the origin of Vedas. [Vedas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedas) are the most ancient scriptures written by great scholars and mentors that decipher the secrets of life and the universe with a bigger landscape of understanding the science behind all of this existence. Among the four Vedas, Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda, and Atharvaveda mention of yogic lifestyle, and Ayurveda is found to be mentioned in Atharvaveda. Let us understand about the four [Purushartha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puru%E1%B9%A3%C4%81rtha) or \" the object of pursuit\" as mentioned in the Vedas 1. Dharma - The Discharge of Responsibilities, righteousness, moral values 2. Artha - Acquisition of Wealth, prosperity, economic values 3. Kama - Fulfilment of Desires, pleasure, psychological values 4. Moksha - Liberation, spiritual values 3. Ayurveda Health - The Science of Life Ayurveda has been majorly divided into three classics including 1. Charaka Samhita- The Charaka Samhita is believed to have arisen around 400-200 BCE. It is one of the oldest and the most important ancient authoritative writings on Ayurveda. 2. Susruta Samhita - The Sushruta Samhita is an ancient Sanskrit text on medicine and surgery, and one of the most important such treatises on this subject to survive from the ancient world. Each of the above branches of Ayurveda concentrates on various aspects of prevention and cure of diseases with a holistic healthcare approach and wellness. These ancient scriptures define the ayurvedic treatment with different types of management strategies including [ayurvedic treatment](https://ashaexperience.com/ayurvedic-doctors/) with chanting, through plant and animal parts, through divine rites, and through human contrivance by means of ayurvedic medicine. 4. Understand Ayurveda Science with Tridosas What are Tridosas? The human body is made up of the five elements that form the entire universe. The five elements are : Ether (space), Air, Fire, Water, and Earth. Tridoshas are the three components of the body, which bring health when in balance, and produce diseases when out of balance. Tridosha defines the three fundamental energies or principles which govern the function of our bodies on the physical and emotional levels. The three energies are known as Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each individual has a unique balance of all three of these energies. The Vata dosha is said to be made up of the air and ether elements. This means that it has qualities that are similar to these elements. The Pitta dosha is said to be made up of fire and water elements. Fire is more predominant, and those people with a predominant Pitta nature have many of the qualities of fire within them. Within the Kapha dosha, there is a predominance of the water and earth elements. Kapha individuals tend to be cool, moist, stable, and heavy. The five elements are the components of the three dosas - Vata, Pitta, Kapha, and Ayurveda states that a human being is essentially an assembly of Tridosas, the intelligent life principles that determine or governs the body, its organs, and their respective functionalities. It further states; Vata is responsible for the mobility or movement of body parts. It governs the nervous system and prana - the Life controls nerve impulses and all higher cerebral functions. This dosa also controls cell division, responsible for cell arrangement and formation of different layers of organ formation. Pitta is responsible for the process of transformation or metabolism in the organ and tissue systems. It regulates nutrition - digestion, absorption, assimilation, and metabolism. Kapha is the agent for strength and cohesion that holds body parts together. It is responsible for biological strength, vigor, provides immunity, and aids in healing. All the fluids running within our body systems are also governed by Kapha. Hence, with Ayurvedic Science, we understand that the three dosas along with the five elements maintain the complete balance of our mind, body, and soul to channelize us towards healthy living. When we get ailments or diseases forming an obstacle in our healthy lifestyle, Ayurvedic treatment takes care of our body with the best preventive and curative measures to track us back to Healthy Living without disturbing our daily lifestyle. Learn the recommended [Ayurvedic Foods for each Dosha](https://ashaexperience.com/ayurvedic-nutritionists-and-chefs/) 5. What is Yoga and Meditation? [practice of Yoga](https://ashaexperience.com/yoga-and-meditation/)leads an individual to the union of consciousness with that of universal Consciousness. Meditation or Dhyana is a part of Yoga, which is mostly performed after Yogasana or physical postures. After doing Yogasana, the body is filled with vital energy or Prana. These energies get channelized through our nervous system to our body during meditation practice. [Meditation ](https://ashaexperience.com/yoga-and-meditation/)and Pranayama or breath control techniques act as a catalyst along with the Ayurveda health and [nutrition](https://ashaexperience.com/ayurvedic-nutritionists-and-chefs/) regime accelerates our healthy lifestyle by directing our mind, body, and soul to be in harmony with nature. Each cell of our system represents the whole creation in every respect. If one experiences the oneness with this quantum realm, that person becomes a Yogi and attains Moksha - state of freedom. Freedom from all the ailments or obstacles that come in their path to achieve the goal of a healthy body and mind in this Life. One must practice Ashtanga Yoga or 8 Limbs of Yoga. What are the 8 Limbs of Yoga? Yama (attitudes toward our environment), Niyama (attitudes toward ourselves), Asana (physical postures), Pranayama (restraint or expansion of the breath), Pratyahara (withdrawal of the senses), Dharana (concentration), Dhyana (meditation) and Samadhi (complete integration) When one practices the above 8 Limbs of Yoga, can embark on the journey to Self-realization leading to Liberation or Moksha overcoming every obstacle and ailments that the body undergoes in this journey of life. Prana - or the vital energy, that which permeates the entire Universe is the foundation and essence of all life. Prana flows in everything that exists. Furthermore, Prana is the connecting link between the material world, consciousness and mind. It is the energy of the body that activates the breath and the mindful stimulation of body parts which is responsible for all our physiological and psychological activities. There are Five main Pranas. What are the five Pranas? Prana, Apana, Udana, Vyana, and Samana, which are responsible for different mechanisms of our body. Prana is distributed throughout the whole body, through the network of the Nadis (nerves). There are 72,000 Nadis in the human body. Of these, there are three Nadis of particular importance. Ida, the \"Moon System\", correlates with the left nostril and the Parasympathetic Nervous System. Pingala, the \"Sun System\", correlates with the right nostril and the Sympathetic Nervous System. Sushumna, the \"Central Nadi\", penetrates the spinal column and correlates with the Central Health and disease are part of everyone's life related to nutrition, physical, mental, social, spiritual and other aspects. If one of the aspects suffers, then all other aspects get affected thus hampering the daily activities of individuals life. Hence Ayurveda recommends that we should take time to nurture and nourish our body, mind and soul to have a holistic wellness approach to balance the entire system. 6. How Yoga builds a Natural Immune System for You? When the mind is calm and clear, an individual is able to handle every situation much better at all times. Yoga with its main components; Asanas, Japa, Pranayama and Meditation helps in bringing calmness to our mind and body. This enables clarity in our thinking, removes the guilt and negative impressions of the past, makes us apprehension-free of the future, and brings our focus to the present moment. Thus Yoga helps in building a strong immune system within our body making us embrace the goodness in us and the surrounding environment. The body and soul are intricately connected with the state of our mind. The state of the mind relates to how we act and react to the information and experiences gathered by our senses with respect to our surroundings. Yoga practice escalates this state of mind. Yoga practice is about building the immune system along with strengthening the inner peace thus gaining an insight into the well-being of mental stability and health. Yoga makes us connect within and understand the person as who we are. It guides us in - how we can enhance healthy sustainable living!
