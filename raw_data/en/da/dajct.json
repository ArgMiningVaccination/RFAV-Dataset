Patients contribute to the costs of the subsidised medicines via two levels of fixed co -payments. PBS expenditure and utilisation are tracked on a monthly basis, with data from 1992 publicly available from Medicare Australia at http://medicarestatistics.humanservices.gov.au/statistics/pbs_item.jsp . Data may be disaggregated by region, beneficiary type, product , and at ATC level 5. Pharmaceutical budgets The P BS represents by far the largest share of public expenditure on medicines. Each year budgeted amounts for the current and subsequent 3 years are presented in the annual Portfolio Budget Statements.3 In 2019 -2020 the budgeted expenditure for the PBS is AUD 12.2 billion (approx. EUR 8.8 billion)4 . Factors taken into account in determining the budget estimates are: Overall fiscal/government budget constraints and macroeconomic factors; Demographic and epidemiologic trends; Clinical guidelines involving pharm aceutical treatments; Past growth trends in pharmaceutical spending; Patent expiry dates for on -patent products, and potential generic or biosimilar entry and uptake; Anticipated market entry of new medicines; Recent market entry, coverage determination s and prices of new medicines; Amended listings, and legislated price changes. 2 Medicines dispensed to inpatients are funded from public ho spital budgets, which are the responsibility of the states and territories, albeit supported by federal funding. Medicines for certain rare conditions are also subsidised under the (federal) Life Saving Drugs Programme (LSDP), and for veterans under the Re patriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. These programmes are very small in comparison with the PBS. 3 See http://www.health.gov.au/internet/budget/publishing.nsf/Content/2018 - 2019_Health_PBS_sup2/$File/2018 -19_Health_PBS_2.04_Outcome_4.pdf 4 In Australia, the financial year extends from 1 July until 30 June of the following year. 7 PHARMACEUTICAL EXPEN DITURE TRACKING, BUD GETING AND FORECASTI NG IN 23 OECD AND EU COUNTRIES \u00a9 OECD 2019 Pharmaceutical expenditure caps The PBS is a demand -driven federal programme with an uncapped appropriation ; thus Australia does not set a cap on overall pharmaceutical expendi ture. However, for certain individual high -cost medicines (and in some cases medicine classes) confidential deeds of agreement with manufacturers provide for rebates where annual expenditure exceeds pre - determined levels. Forecasts and projections In Aust ralia, for the vast majority of medicines covered by the PBS, modelling of expenditure is undertaken by the following process: a) Preparation of prescription volume forecasts using statistical methods, based on historical utilisation of medicines. These forecasts are disaggregated by a number of categories such as drug, patient status, pharmacy type. b) Development of scenarios that model current and future expenditure per prescription. A baseline scenario is created yearly as part of the Mid-Year Econom ic & Fiscal Outlook ( MYEFO) to model current business rules and known future policy settings. New policies are modelled by applying variations to this baseline. c) Evaluation of the prescription forecasts against a scenario. This process calculates expect ed expenditure by using scenario rules to determine the cost of each projected prescription. For a few specialised medicines and programmes, different approaches may be used, such as tracking of patient numbers or of past aggregate expenditure. For that re ason, Australia forecasts future expenditure based on currently subsidised medicines taking into account population growth and disease prevalence. The population growth and disease prevalence are drawn from historical PBS claims data rather than broader national or international sources. The additional net impacts of new medicine listings are added to the forecast as they occur. This takes into account that the inclusion of a new medicine in the reimbursement formulary cannot be assured. The same forecasti ng database is used to model proposed changes to policy settings to ensure that the forecasts also factor in elements such as population growth and disease prevalence. Horizon scanning Horizon scanning takes the form of anticipating patent expiry dates for on-patent products, potential generic/biosimilar entry and uptake, and identification of new medicines expected to enter the market and/or be reimbursed by the PBS. 8 PHARMACEUTICAL EXPEN DITURE TRACKING, BUD GETING AND FORECASTING IN 23 OECD AND EU COUNT RIES \u00a9 OECD 2019 Austria Pharmaceutical expendi ture and utilisation tracking Austria does not currently tr ack pharmaceutical expenditure or utilisation at national or subnational level. However the Main Association of Austrian Soc ial Security Institutions track s expenditure and utilisation on reimbursed outpatient medicines, by individual product. Electronic billing by pharmacies to the statutory sickness funds is the source of expenditure data. The Main Association of Austrian Soc ial Security Institutions maintains a central database of all bill ing data, referred to as automated billing of medicines (\"Maschine lle Heilmittelabrechnung \"). The data are held by the Statutory Sickness Funds (SSF) and the Main Association of Austrian Social Security Institutions. Extracts can be made available upon specific requests to researche rs, government agencies or independent bodies. Pharmaceutical budgets Sickness funds finance covered outpatient medicines dispensed by community pharmacies and state governments finance medicines used in and dispensed by hospitals. The government does not set a budget for pharmaceutical spendi ng at national or sub - national level as part of the budgetary process. However, since 2013, the SSFs and the federal and state governments agree on a cap on annual growth in SSF public health expenditure in national planning agreements . These are based on the federal constitution and referred to as target -based governance agreements (\"Zielsteuerungsvertr\u00e4ge \"). The national cap is disaggregated at the level of each SSF and state government , but not by function of care . Pharmaceutical expenditure caps While target -based governance agreements effectivel y set a cap on total health expenditure by SSFs and state governments , no cap is defined specifically for pharmaceutical expenditure . Forecasts and projections The SSFs and the Main Association of Austrian Socia l Security Institutions routinely prepare aggregate projections of pharmaceutical spending. The projections have time horizons of up to 5 years and are updated quarterly. They draw extensively on expert opinion, are prepared as a standalone exercise, and a re intended for internal purposes only. Results are not made public. While no periodic ex -post assessment is undertaken, forecasts are routinely re -evaluated and updated to address specific questio ns relating to reimbursement decisions. Horizon scanning Horizon scanning is undertaken in cooperation with the BeNeLuxA Network . 9 PHARMACEUTICAL EXPEN DITURE TRACKING, BUD GETING AND FORECASTI NG IN 23 OECD AND EU COUNTRIES \u00a9 OECD 2019 Belgium Pharmaceutical expendi ture and utilisation tracking In Belgium , both pharmaceutical expenditure and utilisation have been tr acked since 1996 for medicines covered by health insu rance . Data are available at ATC level 5 and for individual products . Data are collected from monthly invoices sent from community pharmacies to health insurers, and then sent quarterly to the National Institute for Health and Disability Insurance (NIHDI ). The Monitoring Of Reim bursement Significant Expenses ('MORSE ') report has been published annually since 2008 by the National Institute of Health Insurance (INAMI). Based on reimbursement claims from community pharmacies and hospitals, the report tracks u tilisation and expenditures of me dicines by therapeutic class to understand trends, to evaluate the financial impact of policies and to forecast expenditures. All published reports are available online.5 The last report was published in 2018, with time se ries for number of patients treated, volumes (DDD) and expenditures from 2007 to 2016 or 2017 (estimates), by dispensing entity (community pharmacy or hospital), by therapeutic class, and by active ingredients in some therapeutic classes (INAMI, 2018 [1]). The last report shows for example that medicines dispensed in hospitals accounted for 39% of social insurance pharmaceutical expenditures in 2016. Pharmaceutical budgets In Belgium, a budget is set for total health insurance expenditures of the next year. This overall budget is decomposed in subcategories of benefits, such as physicians, hospitals, pharmacy.6 The pharmaceutical budget covers spending on medicines dis pensed in community pharmacies; admi nistered in outpatient settings ; dispensed or administered in hospitals and included in global budgets or DRG -payments ; and those used in the treatment of specific conditions and paid on top of other hospital payments . The total amount budgeted for 2018 was EUR 4,135 billion. Budgets are also defined at sub-national level . The p reparation of the pharmaceutical budget involves the Ministries of Social Affairs and Budget, health care payers, and the pharmaceutical industry, with the final decision made by the King, after deliberation by the Council of Ministers (cf. Law of 14 July 1994 - art. 69 \u00a7 5). According to the survey, the following survey influence pharmaceutical budget setting : Macro-economic factors Overall fiscal/government budget constraints 5 https://www.riziv.fgov.be/fr/publications/Pages/rapport -morse.aspx 6 http://www.coopami.org/fr /countries/countries/marocco/projects/2015/pdf/2015113006.pdf 10 PHARMACEUTICAL EXPEN DITURE TRACKING, BUD GETING AND FORECASTING IN 23 OECD AND EU COUNT RIES \u00a9 OECD 2019 Demog raphic and epidemiologic trends Clinical guidelines involving pharmaceutical treatments Past growth trends in pharmaceutical spending Patent expiry dates for on -patent products Potential generic or biosimilar entry and uptake Anticipated market entry of ne w medicines Prices of new medicines Recent market entry and coverage determination of new medicines Pharmaceutical expenditure caps In 2015, the 'Pact for the Future' ,7 signed between the Minister of Health and the association representing the pharmaceutic al industry, set expenditure targets on a pluri - annual basis. The Pact anticipated an average annual growth of 0.5% of social health insurance expenditure on pharmaceuticals for the 2016 -2018 period. This was based on hypotheses regarding the impact of new entrants, losses of market exclusivity, and some policy changes (De Block, 2015[6]). The following factors are considered in defining the cap: Macro-economic factors Overall fiscal/government budget constraints Demographic & epidemiologic trends Past tr ends in pharmaceutical spending Predictable changes in medicines distribution costs Medicines in development pipelines Clinical guidelines involving pharm aceutical treatments Medicines in development (pipeline) Patent expiry dates and potential generi c/biosimilar entry/uptake Predictable changes in medicines distribution costs Forecasts and projections Short -term projections of pharmaceutical expenditure are prepared twice yearly by the National Institute for Health and Disability Insurance (NIHDI) tog ether with the Ministry of Social Affairs and the pharmaceutical industry. Projections are developed separately for different sub -budgets (e.g. community pharmacy, outpatient setting, inpatient care, etc.) FORECASTI NG IN 23 OECD AND EU COUNTRIES \u00a9 OECD 2019 and embedded in a broader forecasting model . They are intended for internal use only and not made public .8,9 Inputs to the projections include: Demographic trends Population burden of disease New medicines expected to receive marketing authorisation and/or be reimbursed by health coverage schemes Past t rends in pharmaceutical spending Changes in generic/biosimilar uptake Changes in medicine prices Changes in prescribing or treatment patterns Horizon scanning There is no f ormal ex-post assessment of the predictive value of the projections, but the y are compared to actual value s and to simulations obtained from the PROMES Model, developed by the Federal Planning Bureau (FPB). The Federal Planning Bureau is a public agency that makes studies and projections on economic, social and environmental policy issues and on their integration within the context of sustainable development. For that purpose, the FPB collects and analyses data, explores plausible evolutions, identifies alternatives, evaluates the impact of policy measures, and formulates proposals. Government, parliament, social partners and national and international institutions appeal to the FPB's scientific expertise . Horizon scanning Until recently, there was no formal horizon scanning in Belgium. A proposal for collaboration in horizon scanning for BeNeLuxA was put forward in 2017.10 8 http://www.coopami.org/fr/countries/countries/marocco/projects/2015/pdf/2015113006.pdf 9 Report_full.pdf 12 PHARMACEUTICAL EXPEN DITURE TRACKING, BUD GETING AND FORECASTING IN 23 OECD AND EU COUNT RIES \u00a9 OECD 2019 Cyprus Pharmaceutical expendi ture and utilisation tracking In Cyprus11, pharmaceutical expenditure has been tracked for 10 years. Expenditure data are publicly available in Cyprus Government Gazette Online. Public pharmaceutical utilisation has been tracked since 2014. The data are tracked by therapeutic area; care setting; and at ATC levels 4 and 5. They are not publicly available. Pharmaceutical budgets Cyprus sets an annual pharmaceutical budget , with the aims to control spending ; prioritise expenditures according to health priorities , and allocate a fixed share of health expenditure to pharmaceuticals. The budget is prepared jointly by the Ministry of Heath and the Ministry of Finance, and approved by the Ministr y of Finance. The budget is defined at central level and covers spending on medicines admi nistered in outpatient settings; dispensed or administered in hospitals and included in global budgets or DRG -payments ; and medicines used in the treatment of certain specific conditions - e.g. high-cost cancer medicines prescribed and administered in inpatient settings - and funded separately to other hospital payments. According to responses to the survey, f actors influencing pharmaceutical budget setting are: Overa ll fiscal/government budget constraints Clinical guidelines involving pharmaceutical treatments Past growth trends in pharmaceutical spending Patent expiry dates for on -patent products Potential generic or biosimilar entry and uptake Anticipated market ent ry of new medicines Prices of new medicines Recent market entry and coverage determination of new medicines 11 Note by Turkey: The information in this document with reference to \"Cyprus\" relates to the southern part of the Island.

There is no formal ex-post assessment of the ir predictive value . Horizon scanning There is no formal Horizon Scanning (HS) but EMA's reports are used to pre dict new entries of medicines. 14 PHARMACEUTICAL EXPEN DITURE TRACKING, BUD GETING AND FORECASTING IN 23 OECD AND EU COUNT RIES \u00a9 OECD 2019 Czech Republic Pharmaceutical expendi ture and utilisation tracki ng In the Czech Republic , pharmaceutical expenditure and utilisation tracking only commenced in 2018, with data from 2015 -2017 compiled thus far. Tracking is undertaken by region, therapeutic class, care setting, ATC code, and product, using the National Registry of Reimbursed Health Services (NRRHS), and thus is limited to tracking medicines reimbursed by one of the health insurance companies. As it is a new data collection, the production and dissemination s ystem is still being developed and the data ar e not publicly available. Pharmaceutical budgets The government does not set a budget for public pharmaceutical spending at national or sub-national level as part of the budgetary process. Pharmaceutical expenditure caps The Ministry of Health sets a n annual cap for expenditures associated to medicines used in the treatment of selected conditions ( i.e. high-cost cancer medicines prescribed and administered in inpatient settings) and paid for over and above other hospital payments. The objective of the cap is to control spending, prioritise expenditures according to health priorities, and encourage the use of biosimilar drugs and generics. Factors in setting the cap in pharmaceutical spending are: Overall fiscal/government budget constraints Epidemiologic t rends Past trends in pharmaceutical spending Medicines in development pipelines Potential generic/biosimilar entry/uptake Predictable changes in medicines distribution costs . Each health fund negotiates individual caps with individual health care provide rs but the cap is not always binding (for example in case of unexpected expenditure growth). Individual health insurance funds set their own expenditure caps, but usually follow a template prepared by the Ministry of Health in the annual Reimbursement Dire ctive. Individual caps for the Health Insurance Funds can be found on their respective webpages as part of their health -insurance plans for 2018 (budget item 2.1.5).12 The Directive is binding only in cases where health insurance funds and health care provi ders fail to reach an agreement on the setting of individual caps. 12 For the biggest fund (VZP), the link is: https://www.vzp.cz/o -nas/dokumenty/zdravotne GETING AND FORECASTI NG IN 23 OECD AND EU COUNTRIES \u00a9 OECD 2019 The Ministry of Health consults the Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic (responsible for epidemiological predictions and expenditure forecasts) and the Stat e Institute for Drug Control (responsible for setting the reimbursement of pharmaceuticals and horizon scanning) when setting the cap in the Reimbursement Directive. In 2018, the total capped expenditure amount for high -cost pharmaceuticals was CZK 16 152 million across all health insurance funds. Forecasts and projections The Ministry of Health, in cooperation with the Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic, develops annual projections for health insurance funds' expenditure o n particular groups of high cost medicines prescribed in special centres. The projections are standalone and short -term. The modelling approach used may differ between groups of medicines, but generally includes regression modelling for extrapolation of pa st epidemiological and/or spending trends, with adjustments based on the expected budget impact of newly approved medicines. Some of the methodology has been published in the literature; however, the current reports are primarily for internal use and the o utcomes are used for formulating the Reimbursement Decree . According to survey responses, i nputs to the projections include: Demographic trends Population burden of disease New medicines expected to receive marketing authorisation and/or be reimbursed by health coverage schemes Budget impact as estimated in applications / assessments for reimbursement or coverage Past trends in pharmaceutical spending The modelling approach can differ for different groups of medicines, but generally includes regression mo delling for extrapolation of past trends in epidemiology and/or spending, possibly corrected by clinical decision models; adjustments are made based on expected budget impact of newly approved medicines, Thus far, comparisons of actual vs projected expendi ture have only been undertaken as part of a pilot focusing on innovative medicines prescribed in special centres. Horizon scanning Horizon scanning is not done systematically, but ad hoc working groups look at selected medicines . 16 PHARMACEUTICAL EXPEN DITURE TRACKING, BUD GETING AND FORECASTING IN 23 OECD AND EU COUNT RIES \u00a9 OECD 2019 Estonia Pharmaceutical exp enditure and utilisation tracking In Estonia , pharmaceutical expenditure and utilisation have been tracked since 2003 . Pharmaceutical expenditure has been tracked via an e -prescription system since 2010, with prior data from paper prescriptions also recor ded in an electronic database. Expenditure is tracked by therapeutic class, ATC level 5 and by product. Pharmaceutical utilisation is tracked via the same process, disaggregated by therapeutic area, ATC levels 3, 4 and 5, and individual product. The data are available on line.13 at. Comparisons of actual vs expected utilisation are undertaken by ATC levels 2, 3, 4 and 5, but only aggregate data are publicly available (overall expenditure vs predicted) Based on 2018 data, the Estonian Health Insurance Fund ( EHIF) covers 73% of the costs of out -patient medicines; for in -patient medicines included in the health care service list, 100% is covered. Pharmaceutical budgets Estonia sets an annual pharmaceutical budget in order to control spending on pharmaceuticals and to prioritise expenditures according to health priorities . The budget is defined at central level. The pharmaceutical budget covers spending on medicines: Dispensed in community pharmacies Dispensed or administered in outpatient settings Dispensed o r administered in hospitals; and included in global budgets or DRG - payments Used in the treatment of specific conditions (eg high -cost cancer drugs used in inpatient settings) and funded separat ely to other hospital payments. The p reparation of the pharmac eutical budget involves the Ministries of Health and Finance and health care payers, with the final decision made by the Boa rd of the Health Insurance Fund. The total amount budgeted for 2018 was EUR 139 million f or outpatient medicines and approximately EUR 60 million for inpatient medicines . However , the programme is demand driven, and is still funded if the budget is exceeded. According to survey responses, f actors influencing pharmaceutical budget setting : Overall fiscal/government budget constraints Past trends in pharmaceutical spending 13 https://www.haigekassa.ee/haigekassa/aruanded -eelarve -ja- statistika/finantsnaitajad/soodusravimite FORECASTI NG IN 23 OECD AND EU COUNTRIES \u00a9 OECD 2019 Patent expiry dates Potential generic/biosimilar entry/uptake Anticipated market entry of new medicines Prices of new medicines Pharmaceutical expenditure caps Estonia sets a notional cap on annual expenditure on out -patient medicines ; it should not exceed 20% of the amount allocated for health services benefits in the annual budget of health care expenses. The cap is set by the National Parliament and is driven by overall fiscal/government budget constraints. 14 Foreca sts and projections The Health Insurance Fund prepares annually short -term projections of expenditure covering the pharmaceutical budget as a whole . These projections are embedded in a broader forecasting model. Projections are based on forecasting based o n previous years. The projections are publicly available.15 Ex-post assessment of real vs forecasted expenditure is undertaken quarterly. According to survey responses, i nputs to the projections include: Budget impact as estimated in applications/assessmen ts for reimbursement or coverage Past trends in pharmaceutical spending Changes in generic/biosimilar uptake Changes in medicine prices Changes in prescribing or treatment patterns (Limited) horizon scanning Horizon scanning Horizon scanning is not d one systematically, but an effort is made to forecast the launch of generics and biosimilars and to take these into account in budget planning. 14 See https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/511012018002/consolide 15 See https://www.haigekassa.ee/haigekassa/m ajandusaruanded -ja-eelarve 18 PHARMACEUTICAL EXPEN DITURE TRACKING, BUD GETING AND FORECASTING IN 23 OECD AND EU COUNT RIES \u00a9 OECD 2019 Finland Pharmaceutical expendi ture and utilisation tracking In Finland , the pharmaceutical expenditure for outpatient medicines is tracked at national level. The expenditure is disaggregated by ATC code (level 5). The data i s compiled by Social Insurance Institution and has been tracked for decades, publicly available since 2008 .16 . In Finland the pharmaceutical utilisation is tracked at national level by ATC level 5. Finnish Statistics on Medicines lists drugs according to the ATC classification. These statistics include only preparations registered for human use. The sales figures of Finnish Statistics on Medi cines are based on the sales of the three largest drug wholesalers in Finland, Oriola, Tamro and Magnum Medical, which together account for nearly 100% of total drug sales. The remainder (about 1%) is mainly comprised of hospital sales. VAT (10%) is not in cluded in the wholesale figures. In Finnish Statistics on Medicines, drug consumption is expressed using Defined Daily Dose s (DDD s). The calculations are based on the volume of sales to pharmacies and hospitals by wholesalers and on the assumed average dos e per day for each drug. Consumption is usually expressed as a number of DDDs per 1,000 inhabitants and per day. The Finnish Statistics on Medicines ha ve been published since 1987 and are publicly available .17 Pharmaceutical budgets Finland does not curren tly set a budget for pharmaceutical spending at national or sub - national level as part of the budgetary process . Medicines are fund ed through two different channels. Outpatient prescription medicines are fund ed by the National Health Insurance Scheme while the municipalities are responsible for financing the medicines used in hospitals and in health centres. None of these institutions establish es a strict budget for pharmaceutical expenditures. Pharmaceutical expenditure caps Finland does not define a cap on pharmaceutical spending at national or sub -national level. Forecasts and projections Finland (Social Insurance Institution ) prepares long -term forecasts for preparing budget framework on reimbursement expenditure of outpatient medicines. Horizon scanni ng Finland does not currently undertake pharmaceutical horizon 16 http://raportit.kela.fi/ibi_apps/WFServlet FORECASTI NG IN 23 OECD AND EU COUNTRIES \u00a9 OECD 2019 France Pharmaceutical expendi ture and utilisation tracking In France , pharmaceutical expenditure and utilisation have been tracked for more than 10 years. The national claims database managed by the National Health Insurance Fund provides detailed product level information on expenditure on medicines dispensed in all community pharmacies and all expensive medicinal products in the hospital setting. Expenditure can be broken down by reg ion, care setting , payer, prescriber, therapeutic area, ATC level 5 and product. Raw d ata are publicly available online for medicines dispensed to outpatients, separated in two distinct databases for medicines prescribed by ambulatory providers and medici nes prescribed by hospital s.18 The Healthcare products pricing committee (CEPS) produce s annually some statistics on pharmaceutical expenditures, but not at a very disaggregated level.19 Pharmaceutical budgets France does not set an annual budget for publ ic pharmaceutical spending . However, the annual target set by the Parliament for total social health insurance expenditures includes pharmaceutical expenditures in broader sub -categories for which individual targets are defined (namely outpatient care and hospital care). Many mechanisms, including an alert system, have been put in place to make sure these expenditures targets are not over -run. If there is a risk, emergency measures might be introduced, including measures affecting pharmaceutical expenditure s (e.g. price reductions). Pharmaceutical expenditure caps In France, the Parliament votes annually a cap for the growth of pharmaceutical companies' sales of reimbursable medicines. For 2017, two separate caps had been set for pharmaceuticals dispensed t o oupatients (+0%) and for expensive pharmaceuticals dispensed in hospitals and paid to hospitals beyond and above DRG -like tarifs (+2%). Actual growth in 2017 was below the cap for medicines dispensed to outpatients but exceeded the cap for expensive hosp ital medicines. In reaction, a uniform 20% clawback applied to all companies selling these medicines. Due to a complex mechanism by which companies can accumulate \"rebate credits\" for different motives, this amount was reduced for some of them. The total a mount of \"macro -economic\" clawback due for 2017 was thus (CEPS, 2018 [2]). 18 -data-assurance TRACKING, BUD GETING AND FORECASTING IN 23 OECD AND EU COUNT RIES \u00a9 OECD 2019 For 2018, the two caps have been set at +0% for medicines dispensed to outpatients and +3% for expensive medici nes in hospitals.20 According to France's response to the survey , the following factors are taken into account when defining this cap: Overall fiscal/government budget constraints Demogr aphic & epidemiologic trends Clinical guidelines involving pharmaceut ical treatments Past trends in pharmaceutical spending Patent expiry dates and potential generic/biosimilar entry/uptake Medicines in development pipelines Predictable changes in medicines distribution costs . In 2018, the French government and health i ndustries published a strategic plan to bo ost the development of health industries (CSIS, 2018 [3]). The plan includes provisions aimed to increase the pred ictability of the revenues for the pharmaceuti cal industry. For the next three years, a minimum annual growth rate of 3% has been defined for revenues derived from reimbursed \"innovative medicines\", as well as 0.5% growth of the annual turnover, which corresponds to 1% growth for social health insuran ce expenditure (ibid.). Forecasts and projections Short term p rojections of pharmaceutical expenditure are prepared by the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Finance. Projections are developed several times a year ; cover the pharmaceutical budget as a whole, and are embedded in a broader forecasting model. They are intended for internal use only. There is no formal ex -post assessment of the predictive value of the projections. According to survey responses, Inputs to the projections include: Demographi c trends Population burden of disease New medicines expected to receive marketing authorisation and/or be reimbursed by health coverage schemes Budget impact as estimated in applications/assessments for reimbursement or coverage Past trends in pharmaceut ical spending Changes in generic/biosimilar uptake Changes in medicine prices Changes in prescribing or treatment patterns Horizon scanning 20 See http://www.senat.fr/rap/a17 -068/a17 -06819.html 21 PHARMACEUTICAL EXPEN DITURE TRACKING, BUD GETING FORECASTI NG IN 23 OECD AND EU COUNTRIES \u00a9 OECD 2019 Horizon scanning Regular meetings take place between the Healthcare products pricing committee (CEPS) and repre sentatives of the pharmaceutical industry and in bilateral meetings with companies , in which the R&D pipeline and the prospective entry of new products in the next few years are discussed. Teams in charge of prospective budgeting monitor the launch of new products, as well as reports in the trade press and via expert databases. As a result of the CSIS, the French Haute Autorit\u00e9 de Sante (HAS) is about to create a horizon scanning process for medicines and biomarkers in cancer. 22 PHARMACEUTICAL EXPEN DITURE TRACKING, BUD GETING AND FORECASTING IN 23 OECD AND EU COUNT RIES \u00a9 OECD 2019 Ireland Pharmaceutical expendi ture and utilisation tracking In Ireland , pharmaceutical expenditure and utilisation have been tracked since 1998. The Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS) collects monthly pharmacy prescription claims data using an Oracle database, allowing for disa ggregation of data from which analyses are undertaken and expenditure and utilisation tracked . Expenditure data are disaggregated by ATC level 5 and product. Utilisation data are tracked by ATC levels 3, 4 and 5, and by individual product. The data are no t made publicly available. Pharmaceutical budgets Ireland sets an annual budget for public pharmaceutical spending in order to control spending; prioritise expenditures according to health priorities; and allocate a fixed share of health expenditure to p harmaceuticals. The budget preparation involves the Ministries of Heath and Finance, and health care payers, with the final decision taken by the Ministry of Finance The budget is defined at the central level and covers spending on medicines: Dispensed i n community pharmacies Administered in outpatient settings Dispensed or administered in hospitals and included in gl obal budgets or DRG - payments; Used in the treatment of specific conditions (e .g. high-cost cancer drugs used in inpatient settings) and funded separately to other hospital payments.

Data are disaggregated by region, therapeutic area, ATC level 5, care setting, and product. Public pharmaceutical utilisation is also tracked by therapeutic area; care setting; at ATC levels 3, 4 and 5; and by product. The data are accessible through the website of the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA).22 Pharmaceutical budgets In Italy, a fixed proportion of the National Health System (NHS) budget is allocated to pharmaceutical expenditure . The budget act voted in 2016 for 2017 defined the following element s: The budget for pharmaceuticals is limited to 14. 85% of all resources of the Italian NHS . This budget is further split in two budget caps: 6.89% of NHS spending is allocated to expenditures on pharmaceuticals directly purchased from manufacturers (mainl y by hospitals) and 7.96% to regional expenditures on pharmaceuticals purchased in pharmacies (Aifa, 2018 [4]). If the \"direct purchase budget\" is overrun, then pharmaceutical companies and regions are requested to cover the deficit (50% each). If the \"retail budget\" is exceeded, the pharmaceutical industry and distributors must pay back the difference. Since 2015, two special funds of EUR 500 million each have been allocated to the purchase of \"in novative oncology medicines\" and \"innovative non -oncology AIFA establishes the list of \"innovative medicines\" eligible for this financing and not included in the budget cap defined above (Aifa, 2018 [4]). Italy's pharmaceutical budgets cover spending on medicines: Dispensed in community pharmacies Administered in outpatient settings Dispensed or administered in hospitals and included in global budgets or DRG - payments Medicines used in the treatment of certain specific conditions - e.g. high -cost cancer medicines prescribed and administered in inpatient settings - and funded separately to other hospital payments. The objectives of setting a budget for pharmaceuticals a re to control spending and allocate a fixed share of health expenditure to pharmaceuticals.

However, since 2007, AIFA allocates annual expenditure caps for each pharmaceutical company , based on current and forecast market shares . If the global budget is over -run, each company is requested to claw back an amount of money computed as a proportion of the difference between its actual revenue and its sales cap (Jommi and Minghetti, 2015 [5]) Forecasts and projections Italy currently prepares ad hoc proje ctions of pharmaceutical spending only. Methods for the preparation of systematic projections are currently under development Horizon scanning Horizon Scanning (HS) is used to support the prioritisation of resource allocation in the pharmaceutical sector, by estimating the impact on the NHS of the authorisation of both new medicines and new indications for existing medicines. HS also promotes early access to promising medicines and enables the collection of effectiveness data in clinical practice. HS activ ity regarding products already in development is focused on supporting Health Technology Assessment (HTA) activities through systematic collection of information on medicines that a) could receive marketing authorisation through the centralized procedure within 12 -36 months and b) could have significant economic impact on the NHS. To support optimal resource allocation, AIFA uses predefined criteria to identify and prioritise those products of greatest interest to the NHS. HS methods are re -evaluated yearly in order to optimize the HS activities. 27 PHARMACEUTICAL EXPEN DITURE TRACKING, BUD GETING AND FORECASTI NG IN 23 OECD AND EU COUNTRIES \u00a9 OECD 2019 Japan Pharmaceutical expendi ture and utilisation tracking Pharmaceutical expenditures and utilisation have been tracked since 2011.

The total amount budgeted for pharmaceuticals used in extramural care in 2018 was EUR 4.7 billion . Pharmaceutical expenditure caps The Netherlands does not set a cap on total and/or public pharmaceutical expenditure. Forecasts and projections In the Netherlands, the Healthcare Institute has been forecasting pharmaceutical expenditures for 5 years, with the aim to inform the budget cycle of the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sports . The Central Planning Board (CPB) is also using the results of this estimate, including for the annual Macro Economic Out look. The GIP data collection allows decomposing past trends in volume trends (number of insured person, number of prescriptions and number of standard daily doses) and price trends (price per prescription and price per DDD). The database also enables to distinguish off -patent multi -source medicines and on -patent single source ones. The modelling mainly draws on trends for different categories of medicines ( e.g. inpatient , generics). Trends in v olume s, prices and rates of substitution are taken into accoun t (Zorginstituut Nederland, 2018[18]). The most recent projections cover the period 2017 -2021 . For all years except 2017, the annual growth rate is projected to be 2.5%, which results from a 2.5% annual average increase of volume ( measured in DDDs); and t wo opposite trends which offset each other: lower prices due to health insurance preference policies and price pressures resulting from 37 PHARMACEUTICAL EXPEN DITURE TRACKING, BUD GETING AND FORECASTI NG IN 23 OECD AND EU COUNTRIES \u00a9 OECD 2019 the Pharmaceuticals Prices Act on one hand, and inflow of new, often more expensive medicines on the other hand.

PHARMAC is responsible for both expenditure and utilisation tracking. Disaggregated utilisation and expenditure data do not appear to be publicly available. Pharmaceutical budgets The CPB is set each year by the Minister of Health and in 2017 -2018 budget was NZD 875.50 million for 'combined pharmaceuticals ' (community pharmaceuticals, hospital pharmaceutical cancer treatments, vaccines and haemophil ia treatments ). Pharmaceutical expenditure caps There is no expenditure cap per se, as the CPB operates as a fixed budget constraint . DHBs hold the funds and PHARMAC works to ensure spending does not exceed the CPB, although PHARMAC holds a small discretio nary budget to manage unanticipated overruns. While the 2017 -2018 budget was NZD 875.50, gross expenditure on community pharmaceuticals, hospital pharmaceuticals, cancer treatments, vaccines and haemophilia treatments was actually NZD 1321.10 million, with PHARMAC's commercial agreements with suppliers accounting for NZD 445.60 million in rebates and adjustments .31 However, these represent ex -ante agreed rebates b uilt in to the calcul ation of the CPB, rather than 'clawback ' arrangements to manage overspending . Forecasts and projections PHARMAC's ability to manage within its budget is critically dependent on its ability to forecas t spending accurately. PHARMAC uses a custom -built database , aggregating all the necessary data from different sources. Volumes are forecast separately from transactions /expenditure . The forecast does not include estimates of expenditure on antici pated new investments , but is used to forecas t expenditure 'h eadroom '. Factors taken into account in the modelling exercise include: expert a dvice, drug uptake rates, seasonal and business days, price changes, rebates, policy changes, market changes, transactions, new listings.

The data are publicly available .32 Pharmaceutical expenditure financed by the National Health Insurance scheme has been tracked by the Norwegian Directorate of Health since 2011, based on expenditure data obtained from pharmacies. The data are publicly available at https://helsedirektoratet.no /statistikk -og-analyse/legemidler -statistikk -folketrygden . The Institute for Public Health receives anonymised information from pharmacies about all prescribed medicines which have been dispensed to patients. Uti lisation and expenditure related to prescription drugs dispensed by all pharmacies have been tracked since 2004, for individual products. Information on utilization includes the number of patients treated and the number of DDDs. The data can also be presen ted by gender, age, and geography. The data are available at the Norwegian Prescription Database (NorPD)33 as annual reports with detailed information on medicine u tilisation by ATC class (up to level 5), gender, age group and region (Berg et al., 2018[6]) ). Users can also request tailored report s accor ding to their needs from the website http://www.norpd.no . The Norwegian Directorate for Health also publishes an annual report on pharmaceutical expenditure in hospitals (Norwegian Directorate of Health, 2018 [6]). Pharmaceutical budgets In Norway, medicines are financed through several channels. Regional Health Authorities finance specialised medicines for inpatient ca re or prescribed in hospitals and dispensed by any pharmacy (hospital or community) for outpatient care (known as \"H -prescription medicines\") . The National Health Insurance scheme covers medicines prescribed by primary care providers or specialists. Municip alities finance the costs of medicines dispensed in long term care and patients finance the costs of OTC products and non -covered prescription medicines ( See Figure below ). Norway sets an annual pharmaceutical budget in order to control spending on medicin es financed by the National Insurance Scheme. The Ministry of Health and Care Services (MHCS) develops the budget at central level and the Parliament makes the final decision. The budget for 2018 was set at NOK 10,162 billion (EUR 1. 06 bln).34 According to survey responses, factors influencing pharmaceutical budget setting are past growth trends in pharmaceutical spending ; and potential generic entry and uptake . 32 See https://helsedirektoratet.no/statistikk -og-analyse/samdata 33 See BUD GETING AND FORECASTI NG IN 23 OECD AND EU COUNTRIES \u00a9 OECD 2019 Figure .

The system for managed introduction of new technologies is based on a broad cooperation between the four regional health authorities (including all the hospitals), the Norwegian Hospital Procurement Trust, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, the Norwegian Medicines Agency, the Norwegian Directorate of Health and the Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority. Its overall objective is to manage the introduction of new technologies in order to meet health needs and sus tainability of health systems through managed introduction and prioritization. Horizon scanning for pharmaceuticals is performed by the Norwegian Medicines Agency (NOMA) , in collaboration with the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. Its main purpose is to notify the arrival of new medicines with a predictable impact on the health system. HS reports are not assessments but they provide information on the product, indication, target population, etc. They are available online.36 Practically, NOMA prepares sho rt reports (early alerts) for all new active substances and extended indications that result in new patients, between 6 and 12 months prior to the marketing authorization (MA). The scope is to ensure that new and important drugs are identified and prioriti zed for health technology assessment (HTA). Pipeline meetings with companies are organised as a supplement to the early alerts with a somewhat longer time perspective (24 -36 months before MA). The Norwegian Hospital Procurement Trust and Division drug pro curements (LIS) are represented at the se meetings. Each meeting is limited to 60 minutes and aims to collect the following information for medicines in the pipeline : Active substance and expected mechanism of action Planned medical indication Medical value compared to current treatment Schedule for submission to regulatory authorities and expected approval Participants to the meeting are also interested in: Results from registration studies ; Patient population that may be relevant for the medicine in Norw ay; Upcoming patent expiry ; Price and expected budget impact ; New technology challenging existing regulations . Companies are invited to provide relevant information in written form within one week after the meeting. Information is treated confidentially, unless companies decide otherwise.

The p reparation of the pharmaceutical budget involves the Ministries of Health and Finance, health care payers, and t he pharmaceutical industry, with the final decision made by the Ministry of Finance. Pharmaceutical expenditure caps Poland's pharmaceutical reimbursement system includes a general clawback mechanism, under which 50% of pharmaceutical expenditure exceeding the budget limit (17% of public health care expenditure) must be rebated by pharmaceutical companies. It is also possible to set clawback s as a component of a managed entry agreement concluded during the process of reimbursement negotiations.

The data are not publicly available. Pharmaceutical utilisation has been tracked since 2006, by therapeutic area, care setting, ATC levels 3, 4, and 5, and by individual product. The data are publicly available.38 Pharmaceutical budgets Sweden sets an annual pharmaceutical budget in order to apportion expenditure according to health priorities and allocate a fixed share of health expenditure to pharmaceuticals. Budgets are defined at both central and sub -national le vels. The preparation of the central pharmaceutical budget involves the Ministries of Health and Finance, with the final decision made by the Ministry of Finance. For 2018 the total amount was SEK 27 789 million (approximately EUR 2.7 billion).39 The cen tral pharmaceutical budget covers spending on prescribed outpatient medicines assessed as cost -effective by the Dental and Pharmaceutical Benefits Agency (TLV) and subsidized by government. According to survey responses, factors influencing pharmaceutical budget setting include: Macro-economic factors Overall fiscal/government budget constraints Demographic and epidemiologic trends Clinical guidelines involving pharmaceutical treatments Patent expiry dates for on -patent products Potential generic or biosi milar entry and uptake Past growth trends in pharmaceutical spending Anticipated market entry of new medicines Prices of new medicines Recent market entry and coverage determination of new medicines In addition, hospital medicines and some prescribed outpa tient medicines that are not covered by the government are funded at the sub -national level by regions/ county councils. 38 See at: http://www.socialstyrelsen.se/statistik/statistikdatabas/lakemedel EXPEN DITURE TRACKING, BUD GETING AND FORECASTING IN 23 OECD AND EU COUNT RIES \u00a9 OECD 2019 In 2018, the sub -national level financed medicines for SEK 9 016 million (approximately EUR 880 million). Pharmaceutical expenditure c aps Sweden does not set a cap on total or public pharmaceutical expenditure . Forecasts and projections The National Board of Health and Welfare (NBHW) prepares short -term projections of pharmaceutical expenditure twice yearly . The projections are a standal one exercise and cover the pharmaceutical budget as a whole . The model used to project pharmaceutical expenditures in the next two years is built on a methodology taking into account linear and exponential projections as well as historical variations. Over all volume, product mix and price trends are projected separately. These three inputs constitute the baseline scenario, which is used to model and test the potential effect s that different factors, e.g. the introduction of new medicine s, patent expiries, changes in clinical guidelines and practice, will have on pharmaceutical spending. The projections presented in the report for 2018 -2020 have been developed in collaboration with IQVIA and are based on data extracted from public sources and eHealth database s, and discussed in national expert groups. Furthermore, the projections are based on the assumption that the regulatory framework for reimbursement remain s unchanged during the projection period. However s ome scenarios are not taken into account in th e model, either because the effect on pharmaceutical spending cannot be quantified or it is little likelihood that the scenario will eventuate (The National Board of Health and Welfare, 2018[18]). The predictive value of the projections is assessed ex -post. The NBHW's forecast for the cost of benefits (including VAT) in autumn 2017 was SEK 23. 44 million, and the actual value was SEK 23.26 million , a 0.8% percent difference. The data are publicly available .40 Inputs to the projections include: Demographic trends Population burden of disease New medicines expected to receive marketing authorisation and/or be reimbursed by health coverage schemes Past trends in pharmaceutical spending Changes in generic/biosimilar uptake Changes in prescribing or treatment patte rns Changes in medicine prices Horizon scanning 40 See http://www.socialstyrelsen.se/publikationer2018/2018 -4-21 47 PHARMACEUTICAL EXPEN DITURE TRACKING, BUD GETING AND FORECASTI NG IN 23 OECD AND EU COUNTRIES \u00a9 OECD 2019 Horizon scanning A horizon scanning (HS) working group was established in 2009 by the four largest county councils in Sweden. It identifies new medicines and indications expected to gain marketing authoris ation within a foreseeable timeframe, in three stages: Data collection, monitoring sources Filtration and compilation of collected data - about 1 -2- years before expected marketing authorization (medicines in phase II or III or their development) . Early a ssessment reports describing the current state of knowledge, about 6 months before marketing authorisation. 1) The initial step of the process consists in identifying new and emerging technologies before marketing authorization . The information comes from a variety of sources. It is primarily informed by \"pipeline meetings\" (three meetings are scheduled for 2019) and company reports but also by information from other horizon scanning initiatives, investors reports, press release. Scientific publications, co nference proceedings, information from medicines agencies and registries of clinical trials are used as secondary sources of information (Eriksson et al., 2017 [9]). 2) The f iltration process takes i nto account the following set of criteria : the size of patient population; the s everity of the disease ; the p otential to improve patient clinical outcomes ; an innovat ive way of treating the disease ; the potential to affect treatment costs ; the potential to require reorganisation of the health care system ; potential safety issues needing consideration ; potentially high media/public interest ; potential to influence treatment guidelines ; non -optimal introduction rate following marketing authorization : and potential legal, ethical or political interest . The evaluators also consider whether the medicine/indication belongs to a growing class of medicines or therapy area ; whether it represents a new form of treatment or a new class of medicines ; whether it is relev ant to Swedish conditions.41 3) Early assessment reports on products/indications typically include information on expected date for marketing authorisation, clinical benefits and risks; clinical need and patient population, other completed or ongoing clini cal trials for the same active substance; other completed or ongoing clinical trials for other substances in the same indication; the status of marketing authorisation in other markets, costs and other consequences on healthcare system; as well as options for post-launch monitoring . The horizon scanning system has several outputs: a database with all identified new medicines; a list of prioritized medicines and indications , with individual early assessment repor ts; as well as quarterl y newsletters .42 41 See https://www.janusinfo.se/nationelltordnatinforande/managedintroductionthisishowitworks /inenglish/horizonscanning.5.4771ab7716298ed82ba97406.html 42 See https://www.janusinfo.se/nationelltordnatinforande/horizonscanning.4.728c0e316219da 813569ab4.html 48 PHARMACEUTICAL EXPEN DITURE TRACKING, BUD GETING AND FORECASTING IN 23 OECD AND EU COUNT RIES \u00a9 OECD 2019 Swit zerland Pharmaceutical expendi ture and utilisation tracking Switzerland has tracked expenditures since 23 years but information is only disaggregated by regions.
