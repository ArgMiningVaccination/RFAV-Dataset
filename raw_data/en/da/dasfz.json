It takes many forms ranging from rape in conflict, to female ge nital mutilation, to domestic violence, and has physical, sexual, psycholo gical and economic consequences. As well as being a violation of individual rights, violence against wome n and girls prevents women and girls from flourishin g and contributi ng to their families and co mmunities. It also holds back progress on international development targets. The UK Government can take pr ide in its recently increase d efforts to tackle violence against women and girls overseas following it s 2010 Call to Action on Violence Against Women and Girls. Through it s Strategic Vision on Girls and Women, Th eory of Change, and related guidance, the Department for Inte rnational Development (DFID) has a strong policy framework in pl ace to achieve change for women's lives. DFID now needs to focus on implementa tion. Some impress ive programmes are underway. But violence against women and girl s is not a strategic pr iority for most of DFID recipient countries where rates of vi olence are high. Too few DFID programmes address the underlying social no rms that drive violence, yet tackling the attitudes that sustain violence against women and girls is of paramount importance. Wo rk to tackle violence against women and girls also needs to be a key part of the different sectors in which DFID works. DFID should prioritise acti on against the pervasive , everyday forms of violence that women and girls suffer, including female geni tal mutilation, child marriage and domestic violence. Addressi ng violence against women and girls at grassroots level is crucial: DFID shou ld review its funding chan nels in order to increase funding to women's organisations. The Department must strike a balance betw een getting work to address violence against women and girls underway quickly, and taking the time to learn from the\u2014currently relatively limited\u2014evidence base about 'what works' in different contexts. DFID's new Research and Innovation Fund on violence against women an d girls will help boost the evidence base over the next few years. In the meantime, DFID should adop t a flexible, learning-based approach to programming, piloti ng initiatives and inte grating rese arch into programming, so that it can sc ale up when positive results emerge. Furt her, it must not have unrealistic expectations about how quickly re sults can be achieved. This is especially true for DFID's new \u00a335 million programme on femal e genital mutilation. DFID must also make violence against women and girls a cent ral focus of its humanitarian operations, ensuring that the pr otection of women and girls is a priority from the outset. Refugee camps should be designed to be a refuge not a place where women are at risk of rape and other forms of violence. DFID must get tough with multilateral aid agencies who fail to prioritise this (as too often they do). We welcome the Foreign Secretary's Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative as a way to challe nge the culture of impunity around rape in conflict. We recommend a broa dening of its scope so there is an increased focus on violence prevention, as well as a more clearly articulated role for DFID. 6 Violence Against Women and Girls The Preventing Sexual Violenc e Initiative is representati ve of the UK Government's increased leadership in ternationally on addres sing violence against women and girls. In order to consolidate this positi on and ensure deliver y of change on the ground, DFID must ensure that, as a Department, it is appropriately resourced. It should keep under review the relatively small size of its Violence Against Women and Girls team, and its location within the Conflict, Humanitarian and Security section of the Depart ment. Training on violence against women and girls must be provided to all in-country staff so that they can incorporate work to address vio lence in all relevant prog rammes. Any outsourcing of expertise must be balanced with the need to ensure it is not to the detriment of in-house knowledge. But the UK's international leader ship is weakened by its failure to address violence against women and girls within its own borders, particularly female ge nital mutilation from which 20,000 girls within the UK are at risk. Robust action should be taken to counter political correctness and address cultura lly sensitive pract ices such as female genital mutilation within the UK. Violence Against Women and Girls 7 1 Introduction 1. Violence is an everyday fact of life for million s of women and girls worldwide. Abuses take many forms, from sexu al harassment and female genital mutila tion to domestic violence and rape in war.1 But the root causes are the sa me: inequalities between men and women and damaging social norm s that condone or tolerate the subjugation of women and girls. 2. Violence leaves a devastating physical and emotio nal legacy for wome n and girls. One witness told us of the se nse of isolation and violation that has stayed with her since she was a child: \"As a six-year-old unde rgoing female genital mutilation, I had nobody to talk to. I told my teacher but sh e was not interested.\"2 A World Bank study found that rape and domestic violence are more dangerous than cancer, motor vehicl e accidents, war and malaria.3 Violence also constrains wo men's and girls' a bility to learn and flourish, to be active members of their families and commun ities, and to contribute to their countries' growth and development. 3. The UK Government has made tackling viole nce against women and girls a priority, including for its current G8 presidency. Given the scale of the problem and the increased UK focus on the issue, we decided it was ti mely to undertake an inquiry into the UK Government's work on violence against wom en and girls intern ationally. We are publishing our findings immediately before the UK-hoste d G8 Summit in the hope that they can influence outcomes. 4. We visited Ethiopia in connection with the inquiry, and saw how UK aid money is being used to help prevent and respond to violen ce against women and girls (see Box 1). 4 During the visit, we commissioned a short film abou t early marriage, which we have screened in Parliament. We have disseminat ed the film via Parliament's website and are looking for further opportunit ies to use it to raise awareness of th e issue. We held two evidence sessions with violence against women and girls experts and with women activists from developing countries. We took evidence from the Metropolitan Po lice Service and with UK-based activists working to tackle female genital mutilation in the UK and overseas. We held a third evidence se ssion with the UK Department for Internationa l Development (DFID) Parliamentary Under-Se cretary of State, Lynne Feat herstone MP, and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Senior Minister of State, Baroness Warsi. We also received submissions of written evidence from: non-governmental or ganisations (NGOs); 1 The 1993 UN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women (VAW) defines VAW as encompassing, but not being limited, to the following: \"(a) Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family, including battering, sexual abuse of female children in the house hold, dowry-related violence, marital rape, female genital mutilation and other traditional practices harmful to women, non-spousal violence and violence related to exploitation; (b) Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring within the general community, including rape, sexual abuse, sexual harassment and intimidation at work, in educational institutions and elsewhere, trafficking in women and forced prostitution; (c) Physical, sexual a nd psychological violence perpetrated or condoned by the State, wherever it occurs.\" UN General Assembly, 20 December 1993, online at http://www.un.org/documents/ ga/res/48/a4 8r104.htm 2 Q 45 3 Ev w75 4 The visit to Ethiopia was in relation to three inquiries: Violence Against Women and Girls; Global Food Security; and a planned inquiry into Governance, which we anticipate starting later in 2013. See Annex for more details on the visit. 8 Violence Against Women and Girls researchers; humanitarian relief organisation s; UN agencies; and go vernment departments. We would like to thank everyo ne who was involved in the inquiry, especially those who gave evidence orally or in writing, and who contributed to the visit. We would also like to thank our specialist adviser, Dr Lyndsay McLean-Hilker of the University of Sussex. 5. This report sets out our analysis of, and recommendations for, the UK Government's work to address violence agains t women and girls in ternationally. C hapter Two looks at DFID's policy and programmes on violence ag ainst women and girls, in particular at how the Department might implement its 'Theory of Change' and related guidance on violence against women and girls. Chapte r Three focuses on three spec ific forms of vio lence: female genital mutilation, domestic violence and early marriage. Chapter Four explores UK Government work on violence against women and girls in humanita rian and conflict- affected settings. Chapter Five examines h ow the Government can continue to strengthen its international leadership on violence against women and gir ls, including by taking steps to institutionalise and embe d work to tackle violence against women and girls across DFID. Violence Against Women and Girls 9 Box 1: Ethiopia: Violence Against Women and Girls Girls have a 63% chance of being married by ag e 18; in Amhara 50% of girls are married by 15. A recent survey found 23% 0-14 year old girls had experienced FGM, of which 60% were in Afar. 74% of Ethiopian wome n have had FGM; in Somali region 99% of females undergo the most extreme form. Only 23.6% of married 15-19 year olds have their demand for fa mily planning met. Net enrolment rate for girls at primary school is 65%, dropping to 13% at secondary. 68% of Ethiopian women and 45% of Ethiopian men believe there are circumstances in which wife beating is justified. The Ethiopian Government's policy According to information given to us by DFID during our visit: Ethiopia's government has made strides over recent years improving women's pa rticipation in governme nt and improving the legislative environment. The pr iority now is to align high qua lity programming behind sound policy and legislation. The Govern ment's new Growth and Transfo rmation Plan (2010/11-2014/15) emphasises the need to promote women and yout h empowerment. Ethiopia' s current demographic profile-half the population under 15 with high fertilit y rates (4.8) and an unm et demand for family planning-offers a unique possibility in terms of harnessing the potential of girls to stimulate growth and poverty reduction. Investments in adolescent girls provide long -term benefits, as women with economic and decision-making power w ill tend to choose to have fe wer children, have them later and invest more in their health and education, breaking the intergen erational cycle of poverty and accelerating Ethiopia's prog ress towards the MDGs. DFID Ethiopia programme s for women and girls The programmes include: End Child Marriage programme In partnership with the Gove rnment of Ethiopia, DFID provides \u00a310m (to 2016). Aims to end child marri age for at least 200,000 adolescent girls through changing social norms, and indirectly many more, in the Gojam Zones of the Amhara Region. Girl Hub Ethiopia : DFID's support helps fund radio and ot her media to change attitudes. This includes avoiding child marriage, delaying fi rst pregnancy and birth , completing secondary school, benefiting from economic opportuniti es and and being sa fe from violence. The Community Security a nd Justice Programme seeks to provide 3m women/girls with improved access to security and justice by 2017. In remote Somali region, the Peace and Development Programme will improve access to security a nd justice to 500, 000 women/girls. Maternal and Reproducti ve Health programmes enabling an extra 2m women to use modern family planning and s upporting a further 50 0,000 births to be delivered with skilled attendant. Get Girls through Secondary School: In addition to supporting just under 1 million girls in primary schools, DFID is piloting an innovative results-based aid programme to improve lower secondary school participation and performance, providing additional incentives for up to 50,000 girls including those in the most remote parts of Ethiopia. Through its support for the Protection of Basi c Services (PBS, \u00a3270m to date, plus \u00a3510m approved for 2013-2017) DFID contributes to basic services which support women and girls in education, health, Water Sanitation and Hy giene (WASH), rural roads and agriculture, mainly paying for salaries. The Committee was able to visit a number of these programm es (see Annex, visit programme). Source: Information given to the Committee during vi sit to Ethiopia, 25 February\u20147 February 2013 10 Violence Against Women and Girls 2 Putting policy into action through programmes to tackle violence against women and girls 6. In the last two years, the UK Government has made a numb er of policy st atements and commitments to do more to address violence against women and girls internationally (see Box 2).5 These include the 2010 cross-Governmen t 'Call to End Viole nce against Women and Girls'. In 2011 DFID pu blished its 'Strategic Vision for Women and Girls' which included tackling violence against women and girls with in four priority actions.6 In May 2012, DFID published a Theory of Change of Violence against Women and Girls with accompanying guidance for community-level programm es and monitoring and evaluation.7 7. Witnesses to this inquiry were in agreement that these po licy and guidan ce documents provided a robust framework fo r DFID's work on vio lence against women and girls. DFID has also started to implement some new programming in this area. It states that it currently has 20 country programmes with a viole nce against women and girls component,8 including some regional programmes.9 This increased portfolio includes new areas of work, such as the End Child Marr iage programme (\u00a310 million over five years), which we visited in Ethiopia. There has also been an in crease in focus on vio lence against women and girls within DFID security and justice programmes,10 for example in Ethiopia and the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPTs). DFID also announced new programming on female genital mutilati on in March 2013. 5 For example, Rt Hon Justine Greening MP, 'A new focus on girls and women's rights', speech at Amnesty International, 4 March 2013 and Rt H on William Hague MP, la unch of G8 Declaration on Preventing Sexual Violence, 11 April 2013. 6 The other priority actions are: delay first pregnancy a nd support safe childbirth; improve economic opportunities for girls and women; and get girls through primary and secondary school. 7 DFID's Theory of Change consists of a diagram and accompanying narrative. Together they aim to provide an overview of \"the interventions, outputs and outcomes that can reduce and ultimately eradicate violence against women and girls.\"DFID, A Theory of Change for Tackling Violence Against Women and Girls (2012), p.3 8 Ev 92 9 DFID regional programmes are operated with regional and country partners, and run alongside bilateral programmes. Regional programmes relevant to VAWG include: Raising her Voice, Asia Regional Trafficking Programme; Making Every Voice Count for Gender Equality in Southern Africa; ASTI Tackling Acid Violence Programme; and the UN Women Peace and Security Programme (Ev 92). 10 These programmes generally operate on a bilateral basis and aim to increase access to responsive, accountable and effective security and justice services, especially for the poor, vulnerable and those living in remote and marginalised communities. Violence Against Women and Girls 11 Box 2: Recent DFID a nd FCO outputs - violence against women and girls 2010 Cross-Government 'Call to End Violence ag ainst Women and Girls' launched by the Home Office (with annual Action Pl ans published in 2012 and 2013) 2011 DFID makes 'Preventing violence against women a nd girls' one of four pr iority actions within its 'Strategic Vision for Girls and Women' May 2012 DFID publishes Theory of Change on violence against women and girls with accompanying guidance (How-to notes) on commu nity-level programmes, and monitoring and evaluation, designed to support the translati on of the Theory of Change into practice May 2012 Foreign Secretary launches Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict Initiative (PSVI) March 2013 DFID Secretary of Stat e announces 'Call to Action' on addressing violence against women and girls in humanitarian settings Autumn 2013 DFID Secretary of State to organise international su mmit on addressing violence against women and girls in humanitarian settings Implementing the Theory of Change Strategic priorities 8. Despite these high-level policy commitments and so me new programmes , DFID still has a long way to go to im plement the 2012 Theory of Change (TOC) in practice in its country programmes. We were told t hat violence against women and girls is not a strategic priority11 for most DFID recipient countries in which rates of violenc e are high. Amnesty International highlighted that tackling violence against wo men and girls is only a strategic priority in two out of 27 country programm es (three since the March 2013 announcement that violence against women an d girls would be made a strate gic priority in Afghanistan) and that where women are included as a top priority, the overarching trend is to focus solely on improved maternal he alth and access to education.12 Indeed, in a conflict-affected country such as Somalia , which has high rates of violence against wo men and girls, DFID's current programming consists of a UN Devel opment Programme Acce ss to Justice project, and an NGO Health Consortium Programme \u2014but there are no programmes focused directly on gende r-based violence.13 The main challenge for DFID is therefore to expand the number of programmes working directly on violence against wo men and girls and to ensure that these programmes meet DFID policy co mmitments and the pr inciples and best practices outlined in the Theory of Change. Addressing social norms 9. It has also emerged that the principles highlighted in DFID's Theory of Change have not yet been fully implemented in to key country programmes.14 For example, both DFID's Strategic Vision and its Theory of Change emphasise that prio rity must be accorded to 11 DFID Country Operational Plans categorise their \"results\" (o r outputs) according to a series of strategic priorities which are aligned to 'pillars' within DFID (e.g. Education, Maternal Health, We alth Creation, Governance & Security). 12 Ev w2 13 Ev 109 14 Ev w2 12 Violence Against Women and Girls interventions that fo cus on changing socia l norms that condone violence against women and girls and create a major barrier to effect ive violence prevention and response. We heard first-hand in Ethiopia about the dama ge caused by social norms such as the acceptability of wife beating. We were shocked to find th at nearly 70% of Ethiopian women think husbands are justified in beating their wives.15 10. Yet, as the NGO Womankind highlighted, a relatively smal l proportion of DFID's current programmes address so cial norms and women' s empowerment. Instead, as DFID's own analysis confirms, the majority of programmes focus instead on building institutional capacity to respond to violence against women and girls , notably in the se curity and justice sectors.16 Whilst accepting these were also i mportant priorities, Womankind stated: \"improving the functioning of in stitutions will also have limited impact if women and girls are unable to access these institutions due to social barriers\".17 The Gender Violence and Health Centre at the London School of Hygiene and Trop ical Medicine (L SHTM) agreed that, in order to reconcile its programming wi th its Theory of Change, DFID would need \"greatly to increase its emphasis\" on ch anging the so cial norms that \"condone and maintain violence against women and girls\", and on empoweri ng women and girls. This, we were told, would re quire shifts in countr y-level priorities, an d the ability to monitor these changes.18 In this respect, some evidence su bmitted stressed the need for better tracking of funding on gender equality in general and violence ag ainst women and girls specifically\u2014for example, by applying the OECD gender marker.19 11. We asked DFID to supply us with a list of its violence agai nst women and girls programmes that addressed social norms. It sent us a list of 15 projects.20 It said that it had identified the need to scale up its work on both social norm change and multi-sectoral interventions, and th at its new Research and Innovation Fund on violence against women and girls would look more closely at 'what works' in th is area. It emphasised that new programmes to tackle violence against wo men and girls were being developed in Afghanistan, Nepal, the Occupi ed Palestinian Territories and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), which would include a focus on social norm and multi-sectoral approaches.21 12. In our October 2012 report on 'Afghanistan: Development progress and prospects after 2014', we recommended that DFID upscale it s support to women in Afghanistan, by: supporting shelters and legal services; by creating a jo int donor-government plan for women and girls; and by exerting pressure on other donors and the Afghan Government to back up the Government's previo us commitments to Afghan women.22 We said that the 15 2011 Demographic Health Survey Ethiopia, p.256. Table 14.7.1 shows that two women of every three (68%) agree that wife beating is justified in at least one of the specified situations http://www.measuredhs.com/ pubs/pdf/FR255/FR255.pdf 16 Ev 106-110 17 Ev w83 18 Ev w49 19 The marker is a way of classifying aid according to its impact on the explicit promotion of gender equality in development programming documentation.

We welcome DFID's Strategic Vision for Girls and Women, Theory of Change on Violence Against Women and Girls and re lated programming guidance as a helpful framework for DFID's response to violence against women and girls. We were pleased to see that the number of country programm es with violence ag ainst women and girls components has increased. We were particularly pleased to see women's issues become a strategic prior ity in Afghanistan, as we reco mmended in our report last year. However, more needs to be done to prio ritise violence against women and girls at country level and to bring DFID's programmes in line with the Theory of Change, so that the best practice it hi ghlights is properly implemented. DFID states that 20 countries now have a violence against women and girls comp onent, but actual work on the ground seems thin in a number of country programmes , including Somalia, which has a poor record on women's rights. For countries with high prevalence of violence against women and girls such as DRC, Et hiopia, Nigeria, Sud an and Somalia, DFID should list tackling violen ce against women and girls as a strategic priority. 14. Furthermore, whilst DFID is gradually in creasing the number of violence against women and girls programmes focusing on social norm change, there remains an imbalance towards programmes focusing on security and justice. Addressing the attitudes and behaviours that sustain violen ce against women and girls is of paramount importance. We recommend that DFID signif icantly increase its emphasis on changing the social norms that drive violence against women and girls. In or der to do this, the Department should undertake an assessment of bo th the implementation and impact of the Theory of Change, to see where the gaps lie. This process wi ll also help identify the right strategy for addressing social norms, which will vary from country to country. DFID must also ensure it can monitor th ese changes. We recommend that it put in place systems to enable accurate tracking of the volume and nature of programming on gender equality and violen ce against women and girls. Working across sectors to address violence against women and girls 15. DFID's Theory of C hange stresses that, \"holistic and multi-sectoral approaches\" to tackling violence against women and girls\u2014comprising co-ordinated interventions operating at multiple levels, across sectors and over va ried timeframes\u2014are more likely to have impact. However, there is little detail in the Theory of Change and related guidance on what this means in practice for work in ke y sectors such as health , education, water and sanitation\u2014and in humanitarian and crisis-a ffected contexts, where co-ordination across sectors is vital. 23 International Development Committee, Sixth Report of Session 2012-13, Afghanistan: Development progress and prospects after 2014 , HC 403, para 197 14 Violence Against Women and Girls 16. The evidence we re ceived repeatedly sugge sted that DFID needed to do more to ensure that violence against women and girls was addr essed comprehensively across its work in other sectors. Marie Stop es International said that the health sector was uniquely placed to tackle violence against women and girls, particul arly through sexual and reproductive health services, which most women would access at so me point in their lives.24 The Institute of Education highlighte d the pivotal role of school s and educationa l institutions (universities, departments of education) in preventing and responding to violence against women and girls. It outlined simple steps that could be taken, such as: the employment of more female teachers in scho ols to, amongst other things, act as role models and to undertake activities including running girls' club s and mentoring; teac her training in responding to gender-b ased violence and alternative posit ive methods of di scipline (to help reduce corporal punish ment); in-service trai ning; the development of school policies on gender-based violence; work to help boys understand violence; and clean, sa fe, functioning and sex-separated toilets.25 17. In the water and sanitation se ctor, recent WaterAid research in rural Ethiopia showed that, despite some improvemen ts, some women spend up to nine hours per day collecting water in the dry season, often fr om remote sources, which put them at significant risk of violence. Equally, accessing sa nitation was another risk. In Bhopal, India, WaterAid found that 94% of women interviewed said that they had faced violence or harassment when going out to defecate, and more than a third had been ph ysically assaulted . WaterAid was disappointed that DFID's Theory of Change currently makes no reference to the role that inadequate water, sanitati on and hygiene (WASH) facilit ies has in increasing the vulnerability of women and girls.26 We asked DFID for more d etail on its work to tackle violence against women an d girls in the water and sanitation sectors. DFID responded that it is \"likely\" that new practical guidance will be issued on reducing violen ce against women and girls through improved WA SH programming. It also hi ghlighted the new Sanitation and Hygiene Applied Research for Equity (SHARE) rese arch programme.27 18. We were pleased to see that the need for multi-sector a pproaches to v iolence against women and girls is one of the guiding pr inciples of DFID's Theory of Change. However, we recommend that DFID do more to ensure that sectoral programmes (other than security and justice progra mmes) address violence against women and girls. Health, education and humanitarian response are briefly mentioned in the Theory of Change, but more detailed anal ysis and guidance is required on how programmes in these sectors can best ad dress violence against women and girls and how inter-sectoral resp onses will be implemen ted. This expertise ex ists, as the excellent evidence we received attest s, and must be used. 24 Ev w53 25 Ev w43 26 Ev w88 27 Ev 100 Violence Against Women and Girls 15 19. The water and sanitation sector is omitted entirely from both the Theory of Change and the accompanying guidance notes. This is a major omission , given data that demonstrates the significant risks of violence wome n face when walking to coll ect water or use sanitary facilities. We recommend th at DFID review the Theory of Change and issue specific guidance on how programmes across key sectors-including health, education and water and sani tation-can and should addres s violence against women and girls. Supporting women's organisations 20. DFID's Theory of Change and programming guidance also highlight the vital role played by women's organisations in bringing about changes in at titudes and behaviours towards women and girls at co mmunity-level, as well as in fluencing policy change at national and internatio nal level on violence against women and girls. However, numerous witnesses pointed to the severe inadequacy of funding for women's organisations in recent years. Womankind said that only one de veloping country-ba sed women's rights organisation, Gender Links, was funded un der the Partnership Programme Arrangement fund\u2014one of DFID's main su pport mechanisms to civil society organisations\u2014and that there were no direct grants to such grou ps under the Civil So ciety Challenge Fund.28 21. Witnesses also stressed that DFID's funding mechanisms currently gave little scope for funding the smaller-scale, but often catalytic, work of wome n's organi sations to prevent and respond to violence ag ainst women and girls.29 Womankind highlighted several ways in which DFID could a ddress this. It sugges ted that women's funds30 had a potentially critical role in funding organisations \"conside red too small or risky by the mainstream\". It pointed to a number of well-established wo men's funds\u2014including Mama Cash, the Africa Women's Development Fund, and the Youn g Feminist Fund (FRIDA)\u2014which are experienced in administering grants to women's rights organisations, several of which prioritise work to a ddress violence against women and girls. It said the chie f benefits of women's funds were: that they offered core, mu lti-year funding so that organisations could make long-term plans; that th ey allowed simplified applicatio n and reporting processes; that they had extended \"reach\" to small, remote and minority organisa tions; and that they allowed large grant-make rs such as bilateral donors to sub-contract the partnership and administrative workload.31 22. As another way of supporting women, we were inter ested in the possibili ty of setting up informal in-country panels, representing wo men's groups and gender experts, who could help ensure DFID was meeting local priorities. We asked DFID about this option, and were told that DFID country office s used more formal advisory groups for programmes on gender equality and violence against women an d girls. The main purpose of the groups was to inform strategy and progra mme design, and to advise on implementation and review. One example given was the End Child Marriage Stee ring Committee in Ethiopia, which is 28 Ev w84. The Civil Society Challenge Fund is another primary channel of DFID support for development projects or civil society organisations. 29 Ev 60 30 Women's Funds are charitable funds set up to support initiatives that benefit women and girls. 31 Ev w84 16 Violence Against Women and Girls comprised of government , local civil society or ganisations and others, and which provides strategic direction for the Government of Et hiopia programme to delay marriage among girls, funded by DFID.32 23. We are pleased that DFID acknowledges the importan t role played by women's organisations at local, natio nal and international levels to bring about chan ges in social norms, institutions and policies to preven t and respond to violence against women and girls. However, many women's organisa tions\u2014especially sma ll community-based organisations\u2014often st ruggle to get adequa te funding. We recommend that DFID review its funding channels and seek to incr ease funding to wome n's organisations to work on violence against wo men and girls at community, national and international levels. This should include both core and programme funding and ensure continuity and stability of funding over time. We recommend DFID exp lore funding specific women's funds for this purpose. We also recommend that DFID look at the way that it uses women's knowledge and expertise in-country to comm ent on and 'screen' DFID's gender policies. We un derstand that DFID uses formal gender advisory panels in some countries. We recommend th at such formal gender pane ls are established in more countries. We also recommend that informal local panels ar e established so that local women can be involved in develo ping policy priorities, and to ensure that grassroots organisations secure the funding they need. Civil society organisations in Ethiopia 24. We came across anothe r potential obstacle to the funding of NGOs during our visit to Ethiopia, where Article 14 of the 2009 Proclamation on Char ities and Societies prohibits international NGOs from engaging in a range of work including gender equality, human rights, justice, and ch ild rights. Only Ethiopia n charities and societies are allowed to work in this area without legal constraint. However , Ethiopian charities an d societies may only receive a maximum of 10% of funding from fore ign sources, so are he avily constrained in their budgets. Organisations wh ich receive more th an 10% of their funding from foreign sources are classified as foreign. The law seems to include legal support to Gender-Based Violence (GBV) survivor s, GBV prevention and rights-b ased approaches to GBV. DFID informed us that many organi sations have also been told to stop prevention work on harmful traditional practices including FGM.33 25. In 2012, DFID commissioned a brief study to examine the impact of the proclamation on GBV-related services\u2014both from civil society orga nisations, and gove rnment services. The study found that although there has b een some improvement in local government efforts to respond to this issue, there was a lack of skills, ca pacity and resources to deal with such a major phenomeno n. The study concluded that the loss of civil society expertise, access and capacity building of relevant government institutio ns is likely to exacerbate the vulnerability of GBV survivors. We were told that ma ny NGOs are deep ly worried about the impact of the law on GBV survivors. However, it is difficult for them to challenge the law, or to engage in advocacy (since this is prohibited). 32 Ev 105 33 Discussions during the visit to Ethiopia, 25 February to 7 March 2013. Violence Against Women and Girls 17 26. We were told that the issue had been rais ed forcefully by Ly nne Featherstone MP, DFID Parliamentary Under Secr etary of State, with Prime Minister Hailemariam and she had received assurances that so me improvements would be made.34 In our meeting with Prime Minister Hailemariam, he emphasised that he recognised the importance of gender issues, including girls' education. He said he understood th e importance of challenging social norms when tackling vio lence against women and girls. On the NGO law, the Prime Minister explained that Ethiopia , like Western states, believed that intern al politics and the funding of political parties wa s a matter for Ethiopian nati onals. Foreign human rights organisations had in the pa st provided support for Oppo sition partie s, which was considered unaccepta ble. However, he sugg ested that he would consider making DFID funding exempt from the law, which was not designed to target organisations like DFID. The issue of exempting certai n types of work on gender, for example work to combat FGM, from the law was also raised. 27. We were concerned about the impact of Et hiopia's Proclamation on Charities and Societies law on civil societ y organisations in the country, and particularly on their ability to work on gender-b ased violence (GBV) . We commend DFID's decision in 2012 to commission a study to exa mine the impact of the pr oclamation on GBV-related services. We also commend the DFID Parliamentary Under Secretary of State Lynne Featherstone MP for raising the issue with Prime Minister Hailemariam. We hope that the Ethiopian Government will review the hum an rights implications of the law, and urge it to exempt DF ID from the 2009 law on charities and soci eties, and, indeed to ensure that certain types of work on gender\u2014includ ing violence against women and girls\u2014can also be exempted. Using the evidence base to in form policy and programming 28. In November 2012, DFID announced a new \u00a325 million , five-year Research and Innovation Fund on with th e aim of improving the eviden ce base\u2014and in turn DFID programming. The final bu siness case for the Fu nd was approved on 22 February 2013 and outlines four components: 35 1. Prevention of violen ce against women and girls in stable and fragile con texts (up to \u00a317.8 million over five years); 2. Violence against wome n and girls in conf lict and humanitarian emergencies (up to \u00a35 million over five years); 3. Economic and social co sts of violence against wome n and girls (up to \u00a31.5 million over three years); 4. Evaluation (up to \u00a30.7 million ov er three years). DFID identifies the key reci pients of the new knowledge and evidence gene rated by the Fund as decision-makers at the national and international leve ls, including global partners such as: UN Women; bilateral agencies ; national govern ments; civil society organisations; DFID country staff; th e research community; and the media.36 The four 34 The Minister visited Ethiopia in February 2013. 35 Detailed information on the Fund's four components is set out in DFID's written evidence (Ev 103-104). 36 Ev 104 18 Violence Against Women and Girls components will be tendered separately d uring 2013 and compon ents 1 and 2 (the largest) will undergo a 6-month inception phase. 37 29. Witnesses to this inquiry welcomed the launch of the Fund and recognised the urgent need to improve knowledge in the violence against women and girls field. For example, experts from LSHTM's Ge nder Violence Centre agreed that the evidence base was currently limited. Th ey said that DFID sometimes had unrealistic expect ations about the state of evidence on violence against women and girls, an d urged the Department not to rush into large-scale programmes with limited evidence of what works. They stressed that, whilst there were many well-fo unded insights into the factors that contribute to gender- based violence, the evidence av ailable to inform different ty pes of interventions varied greatly by setting and type of violen ce. They stated: Thus far, we have more e vidence to inform programming in the areas of Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C) and pa rtner violence than we have in sexual exploitation, violence in conflict situations , child sexual abuse, acid throwing, or honour crimes. Even with FGM/C and partner violence , however, experience trying to prevent these forms of viole nce rather than dealing with their consequences, is relatively new. Even newe r are efforts to rigoro usly evaluate those approaches that are being tr ied. For this reason , it is very i mportant that new interventions are eval uated, but new initiat ives need to be sens itive to the state of the field and knowledge.38 30. The LSHTM submission stated, however, that \"absence of evidence should not be used as an excuse for inaction; rath er it argues for moving forward in a thoughtful and informed way\".39 Indeed, as we indicated to DFID's Parliament ary Under Secretary of State, Lynne Featherstone MP, we be lieve DFID must ensu re clear timescales are in place for the introduction of new programmes to addres s violence against wo men and girls. The Minister told us that there wa s no \"drift\", and that upscalin g of work to tackle violence against women and girls within country programmes was \"already happening\", and that new programmes were bein g \"designed, published and implemented [...] the whole time as opportunities arise\".40 31. The LSHTM also expressed conc erns about unrealistic timeframes for expected results from programmes to tackle violence against women and girls. It said: DFID's programming on violence against wom en and girls is mo ving towards more sustained funding, as evidenced by its su pport for violence work in Bihar. But the majority of its support is still relatively short-term, give n the nature of the task at hand.41 37 Ev 104 38 Ev w50 39 Ev w50 40 Qq 46 and 54 41 Ev w50 Violence Against Women and Girls 19 In particular, the LSHTM stressed that work on violence prevention required longer-term funding and a recogn ition that it would ta ke time to gene rate evidence about what worked and that results and impact wo uld not be immediate. It sugg ested DFID adopt approaches that integrate rigorous research into programm es as they were developed and rolled out, alongside piloting. Interventions could then be gradually scaled up as and when positive results emerge, with modi fications along the way.42 32. DFID's own Theory of Change and guidance st ress that progress is rarely linear and that key changes in social no rms will take 5-10, or even 10-plus, years. Annmarie Mavenjina of ActionAid told us of her experien ce in Tanzania of do nors giving funding for projects to tackle violence against women and girls with 3-4 year timelines, then withdrawing funds if objectives were not re ached in that period. She said that even showing results within the 5-ye ar programmes offered by DFID was tight, an d that a 10- year window was required to ensure \"tangible results\" within co mmunities. She also recommended a pilot phase for programmes fu nded by DFID, follow ed by a mid-term review and endline th en a follow-up at the ten-year point.43 33. We welcome DFID's new Research and Innovation Fund fo r violence against women and girls, announced in November 2012. Unfortunatel y it looks unlikely that the research components will be activated un til 2014. Whilst we un derstand the reasons for not rushing the tendering process, DFID ne eds to be mindful of getting the research fund up and running quickly. This is also true for programmes to address violence against women and girls more widely. DFID must have th e milestones in place to ensure new progra mmes are introduced with a reasonable timeframe. 34. However, there is a balance to be struck. Given the relatively limited evidence about 'what works' to prevent violen ce against women and girls in different contexts, it is important that the Department does not rush into large-sc ale violence against women and girls programming with unrealistic expectations about timeframes and results. Research into violence against women and gi rls, as well as progra mming, needs to have realistic timeframes, in recognition of th e time needed to brin g about and measure complex social change. We recommend that DFID take a lead internationally by investing in longer-term, flexible and phased programming involving piloting, integrated research and analysis, and gradua l scale-up of progra mmes and evaluation. Programmes to tackle violence against women and girls shou ld have a minimum 5-year timeframe and realistic results frameworks (including using interim and process indicators) in recognit ion that follow-up ph ases are likely to be needed and long-term impacts may only be realised after 10-plus years. 42 Ev w50 43 Q 17 20 Violence Against Women and Girls 3 Targeting everyday forms of violence against women and girls 35. International agreements recognise and cond emn a wide range of different forms of violence against women and gi rls\u2014including rape, sexual violence, physical violence, emotional violence, hono ur crimes, female ge nital mutilation (FGM ), acid attacks, and early marriage. Yet, in many communities on the ground, so me of these practices have been treated as a 'nor mal', expected and/or ac cepted part of everyd ay life for women and girls. This chapter will exami ne three forms of violence that are a common feature of everyday life for m illions of women and gi rls globally and are mainly perpetrated by members of their own families and local communities : female genital mutilation, early marriage and domestic violence. Female Genital Mutilation 36. The World Health Orga nisation estimates that globally, up to 140 million girls and women have been subjected to some form of fema le genital mutilation.44 Used to control women's sexuality, female genital mutilation involves removing or otherwise cutting the external female genitalia (see Box 3). It is usually performed on children an d is generally carried out by unskilled practitioners who use unsterilised instruments and no anaesthetic, risking potentially lethal in fection. Other consequences include severe pain during urination, menstruation , sexual intercourse, and childb irth, and psychological trauma. Often perceived as an African problem\u2014it is practised in up to 42 African countries\u2014it is also widespread in some Asian countries and the Middle East (fo r example, in Iraqi Kurdistan more than 70% of women have undergone fe male genital mutilation). Prevalence rates vary significa ntly between and within coun tries according to differing community practices. The highes t rates are found in countries in the Ho rn of Africa. 98% of women in Somalia have experien ced female geni tal mutilation.45 44 The terminology used to describe the practice varies. Within the UK Government, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Department of Health and Home Office use 'FGM' whilst DFID uses Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting. A witness (Efua Dorkenoo of NGO Equality Now, see Ev 71) called cutting \"an apologetic term\" and highlighted that many multilateral organisations\u2014including the World Health Organisation, European Union, UN Women, Convention of the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination against Women, Commission on the Status of Women, UN General Assembly and the African Union\u2014and African wo men activists use the term FGM. We have decided to follow their lead and refer to the practice as female genital mutilation within this inquiry. 45 Ev 71. 97% of Somali girls aged 15-19, and 99% of women aged 35-39, have experienced FGM. Violence Against Women and Girls 21 Box 3: The four main types of female geni tal mutilation The World Health Organisation cl assifies female genital mutila tion into four major types: - Clitoridectomy: partial or tota l removal of the clitoris - Excision: partial or total removal of the clit oris and the labia minora, with or without excision of the labia majora - Infibulation: narrowing of the vaginal opening through the creation of a covering seal. The seal is formed by cutting and repositioning th e inner, or outer, labia, with or without removal of the clitoris. - Other: all other harmful procedures to the fe male genitalia for non- medical purposes, e.g. pricking, piercing, incising, scrapi ng and cauterizing the genital area. Source: World Health Organisation, Fact Sheet no 241: FGM, online at http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/ 37. In March 2013, DFID announced dedicated funding of \u00a335 million and programming to \"end female genital mutilation in one ge neration\". Its business case for the new programming highlighted that collective donor effo rt and funding to address the practice is currently low (totalling approximatel y $18 million glob ally in 2011).46 Although DFID has had only had limited engagement in this issue so far, it says that there is now a \"window of opportunity to end female genita l mutilation\" due to \"strong Af rican leadership and real momentum for change in Africa\" with increasing numbers of communities, traditional and religious leaders, national policy-makers and other high-profile champions working to end female genital mutilation.47 DFID aims to \"provide a comprehensive package of support\" to prac tising communities, whilst also ensuri ng legislation and policy is in place and implemented. It will also fund \"social change commun ications\" (including in the UK) and research. DFID states that this will be the first phase (5 years) of DFID 's work towards ending female genital mutilation in one generation (20 years).48 38. DFID's business case admits that there is \" limited robust evidence on effectiveness of interventions to end femal e genital mutilation\".49 It says that the approach to bringing about behaviour change via \"village empowerm ent\"\u2014as pioneered by the NGO Tostan in Senegal starting in the late 1980s\u2014\"has probab ly shown the best re sults on the ground\" compared to other in terventions to reduce fe male genital mutilation in African countries.50 However, when we asked the DFID Minister, Lynne Featherstone MP, about the approach DFID would take, she said she had made no fi rm decision and would be led by research.51 39. Whilst recognising the achi evements of Tostan, NGO an over-reliance on the village empo werment approach. It said th at DFID's business case \"appears to show a strong bias towards th e Tostan approach [...] over other approaches whilst at the same time noting the lack of robust evidence on effectiveness of interventions to end female genital mutilation\".52 Equality Now highlighted t hat the 27% decline in the 46 DFID Business Case for ending FGM, 'Towards ending of FGM/C in Africa and beyond' (March 2013) 47 DFID Business Case for ending FGM, 'Towards ending of FGM/C in Africa and beyond' (March 2013) 48 DFID Business Case for ending FGM, p.15 49 DFID Business Case for ending FGM, p.16 50 DFID Business Case for ending FGM, para 19 51 Q 194 52 Ev 75 22 Violence Against Women and Girls prevalence of female genital mutilation in Burkina Faso\u2014w hich has followed a different approach based on law and po licy enforcement\u2014is greate r than in Senegal (5%).53 A recent research paper found that evidence on the effect iveness of a range of interventions to tackle female genital mutilation wa s insufficient to judge whethe r they had actually led to a decline in the practice. The same research found that success of the type of approach used in the \"community-led\"/vill age empowerment process varied greatly between communities.54 40. We welcome DFID's announcement of \u00a335 million for programming to \"end female genital mutilation in one generation\". If this aspiration is to be met, the \u00a335 million funding must see rapid\u2014but careful\u2014investment. DFID's Business Case says that the NGO Tostan's approa ch on village empowerment, pioneered in Senegal, has probably shown the best results on the ground. Yet we have been told that it is too early to be sure that this approach is the most effective way to reduce FGM. We remind DFID of our earlier recomm endation to adopt a phased and flexible approach to programming, and to build the evidence base as it works, rather than to rush into large- scale programming to addre ss violence against women and girls based on a single model where the evidence on alternative models of intervention is incomplete. 41. During our inquiry we also looked at ho w the UK is affected by female genital mutilation, where it is estimated that around 20,000 girls are at ri sk and 66,000 women are living with the conse quences of FGM .55 We thought it important to know how effectively the UK was tackling the practice within its ow n shores, so that we co uld judge its credibility in calling to end the pr actice internationally. We were disappointed to find out that despite the fact that female genital mutilation has been illegal in the UK sinc e 1985, and punishable by up to 14 years in prison, there has not been a single prosecution\u2014even after the law was tightened in 2003 to criminal ise female genital mutilation ta king place on UK citizens overseas. This is despite 148 referr als being made to th e police since 2009.56 42. We questioned the Metropolitan Police Se rvice about the failure to prosecute for FGM in the UK. They said that it wa s difficult to get vict ims, who tended to be young girls, to come forward. They told us they were lookin g at ways to provide support and prosecute without having to rely solely on the victim's testimony.57 We asked them whether they collaborated with social services to ensure that at-risk girls were plac ed on the Child Protection Register. They were not aware of this ev er happening for referrals they 53 Ev 74 54 R.Elise B.Johansen et al, 'What Works and What Does Not: A Discussion of Popular Approaches for the Abandonment of FGM', p.6, Obstetrics and Gynaecology International , Volume 2013 (2013) 55 Data on the prevalence of FGM in the UK is incomplete. The available estimates for England and Wales from secondary data show that 66,000 African women resident in England and Wales in 2001 had FGM and more than 23,000 girls largely from African communi ties under the age of 15 were at risk of FGM or may well have undergone FGM (Ev 70). We received evidence from the Scottish Government, which told us that it is currently considering data that might help it estimate the prevalence of FGM in Scotland, where data is incomplete. The Scottish Government said that, according to the 2001 Census data, there were 2,946 women between the ages of 0-49 living in Scotland and born in one of the 29 countries in which FGM is reported to be a traditional practice. They suggest that numbers from the 2011 Census (when available later this year) are likely to be significantlyhigher, as is demonstrated by the increase over time in numbers of births registered in Scotland to mothers who were born in one of these countries (from 120 births in 2001 to 656 births in 2011) (Ev 94). 56 Qq 33-34 57 Qq 54-55 Violence Against Women and Girls 23 received.58 Nimco Ali, an anti-female genital mutilation activi st, suggested that political correctness was preventing po lice and other profes sionals\u2014teachers, so cial workers, the NHS\u2014from stepping in, and that the UK must stop \"treading on cultural eggshells\".59 Dr Purna Sen of the London School of Economics told us that: Cross-cultural conversations on violence against women and gir ls can suffer from excessive deference to differen ce and diversity or an aggr essive sense of cultural superiority [...] Dial ogues on child marriag e, crimes of 'honour', dowry, female genital mutilation and many other forms of violence often beco me tangled in angst about interference in the cultural norms of others.60 43. The 2011 UK Government Call to Action and Action Plan on Violence Against Women is a cross-Whiteha ll effort that includes actions to tackle female ge nital mutilation. This is accompanied by the Multi-Agency Guidelines for Female Genital Mutilation (also 2011). However, the NGOs Equality Now an d FORWARD both questioned their effectiveness of these strategies, saying that in practice no effective multi-agency response was in place.61 We wrote to Rt Hon Je remy Hunt MP, Secret ary of State for Health, to ask what action he was taking on female genital mutilation. He told us he was \"exploring\" how to collect and report data with in the NHS in line with Depa rtment of Health commitments in the recent Action Plan on female genital mutilation prosecution launched by the Director of Public Prosecution (DPP), Keir Starmer QC.62 44. We also wrote to the DPP rega rding efforts to obtain pros ecutions within the UK. We were told that there had been four referrals to the Crown Pr osecution Service (CPS) since 2011, but it had been decided that no action would be taken for the fi rst three cases and the fourth was under consideration but at an early stage. The DP P also said that the CPS was considering the possibility of using child protection legislation to prosec ute cases of female genital mutilation.63 At an evidence session with the Justic e Select Committee on 21 May 2013, the DPP said th at he was \"confident enough no w to amend our guidance\" to use alternative means of prosecuting.64 Recent press reports suggest the Met Police will re- open six female genital mutilation cases from betw een 2009 and 2011.65 The reports quote Met detectives as saying they want prosecutor s to rule on the use of alternative charges, such as that of allowi ng or causing a child to suffer serious injury .66 58 Q 42 59 Q 44 60 Ev w47 61 Ev 69, Ev w26 62 Letter from Rt Hon Jeremy Hunt MP, Secretary of State for Health, to Rt Hon Sir Malcolm Bruce MP.

We were shocked to discover that there are estimated to be 20,000 girls at risk of female genital mutilation within the UK. Whi lst it is beyond our remit to comment on domestic policy, we believe th at\u2014as it stands\u2014the UK's credib ility in calling to end the practice overseas is undermin ed by the failure to tackle the problem at home. Witnesses recommended that the UK must put aside political correctness an d adopt a far more robust, cross-agency approach, where the police proact ively track girls at risk of female genital mutilation and step in to prev ent parents having the procedure performed on their daughter(s). We commend these reco mmendations and urge the Government to act upon them. We we re appalled to discov er that, despite 148 referrals of female genital mutilation cases in the past four years, police and so cial services do not place at- risk girls on the Child Protect ion Register. Th is must change. 46. There is far greater scope fo r joint working across Government on tackling female genital mutilation overseas and in the UK, including through engagement with diaspora groups in the UK. We recommend publication of an up-to-date, binding document that requires all service provid ers\u2014Departments of He alth and Education, DFID, the FCO, Home Office, Government Equ alities Office, the Metropolitan Police Service, Ministry of Justice, and the Cr own Prosecution Service\u2014to play their part . We draw these recommendations to the attention of the relevant select committees. Early marriage 47. Early marriage is one of the greatest thre ats to the protection of women and girls. One- third of girls in developing co untries are married by the age of 18, some as young as seven years old. Girls may be married of f in the (sometimes well-intent ioned) belief that this will protect them from conf lict or from 'immoral' sexual a dvances and give them security. Marriage is sometimes offered as an alternative to schooling. During this inquiry, we had an opportunity to talk about this issue firsthand with bene ficiaries of the DFID 'End Child Marriage' programme in Ethiopia. A former child bride from Ethiopia told us of the links with poverty: Child marriage was supposed to relieve pre ssure on the poor fa mily and guarantee the future economic wellbeing of the child wife, especially if she was married into a wealthy family with plenty of land, cows, go ats, sheep and donkeys. In other words, a girl's value was measured in te rms of the age at which she got married and the family in which she was marr ied, but not her va lue as an individual.67 48. There is a direct link betwee n early marriage and violence. Girls who marry early are more likely to experience domestic violence, abuse an d forced sexu al relations.68 Girls may be taken away from thei r families and commun ities and early marriag e forces girls into responsibilities fo r which they may lack the emotion al and physical maturity to cope. Those who marry early are more likely to experience poor er levels of sexual and reproductive health\u2014including early pregnancie s, which carry higher risks for the mother and the child.69 There is also sometimes a link with female genital mutilation, as mutilated 67 Ev w24 68 APPG on Population, Development and Reproductive Health, A Childhood Lost , 27 Nov 2012 69 Ev w91-92 Violence Against Women and Girls 25 girls are often perceived as more appealing to husbands. In some contexts, there is anecdotal evidence that girls wh o have been infibulated (the most extreme form of female genital mutilation) attrac t a higher bride price.70 49. We visited Ethiopia to see ho w UK aid was being spent on violence against women and girls, and on ending child marri age specifically. We made a sh ort film about our findings, which is can be viewed via our website.71 We saw a flagship DFID project, Finote Hiwot \u2014 the End Child Marriage programme\u2014funded with \u00a310 million over 5 ye ars (to 2016). The programme aims to reach 200, 000 girls in the Amhara regio n, where 50% of girls are married by age 15\u2014a factor in the region's h igh adolescent birth ra te. It is hoped that tackling child marriage will also help reduce Ethiopia's high materna l mortality ratio (676 per 100,000 live bir ths in 2011) and boost school enrolment figure s for girls (net primary enrolment rate currently stands at 65% of gi rls, falling to 13% at secondary level).72 Project activities include school radio programmes, community conversati ons and discussions with influential local leaders. ActionAid told us of a similar approach it was supporting in Tanzania, where priority was giv en to talking with men, wome n, boys and girls about the implications of early ma rriage, and of using sc hool clubs to convey the links with girls' education.73 50. We asked Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland, form er Prime Minister of Norway, about the recent campaign on ch ild marriage she has helped lead for The Elders.74 She stressed that the practice of early marriage is rooted in gender inequalities and norms that place a lower value on women and girls and see them as po ssessions to be exchanged. She emphasised political leadership, saying that \"when Foreig n Ministers and Prime Ministers speak out on these issues, it is intensely important\".75 The NGO World Vision su pported this and called on the UK Government to demonstrate internati onal leadership in committing to ending early marriage by 2030, sp ecifically through a public comm itment by the UK Prime Minister to a gl obal campaign.76 51. We were impressed with DFID's Finote Hiwot programme, which is working to end child marriage in the Amhara region of Ethiopia. It is supporting vital community- level work that is addressing social norms and helping girls, boys and their communities understand the implications of early marriage, including the serious consequences for maternal health and girls' schooling. We ask DFID to consider where it could roll out similar progra mmes, and to report back on th is in its response to this report. We also urge the UK Government to make a political commitment to ending child marriage internationally, as it has do ne with female genital mutilation. The two practices are linked, and\u2014as with female ge nital mutilation\u2014politic al leadership will be crucial to endi ng the practice. 70 APPG on Population, Development and Reproductive Health, A Childhood Lost , 27 Nov 2012, p.33 71 www.parliament .uk/indcom 72 Figures from briefing provided by DFID on the visit. 73 Q 22 74 The Elders is an independent group of global leaders working on peace and human rights. 75 Q 103 76 Ev w92 26 Violence Against Women and Girls Partner violence 52. Domestic violence, sometimes more appropr iately described as 'intimate partner violence',77 is the most common form of violenc e globally and its prevalence greatly exceeds that of all other forms of physical an d sexual abuse suffered by women.78 Globally, up to seven out of ev ery ten women experience intimate partner viol ence (physical and/or sexual violence) in their lifetime.79 Women with disabilities are twice as likely to experience domestic violence as non-disabled women.80 53. A recent evidence revi ew commissioned by DFID revealed that more research is available on partner violence than on other forms of violence against women and girls (although most evidence is from developed country contexts).81 The review concluded that three factors contributed to high levels of part ner violence: (i) social norms related to male authority, acceptance of wife -beating and female obedience; (ii) childhood exposure to violence; and (iii) excessive a lcohol abuse. Although the revi ew found that the evidence base on what works to reduce partner violence was limited, the revie w's author, Dr Lori Heise of LSHTM's Gender Violence Unit, told us a key lesson was the need better to integrate work on intimate part ner violence with DFID's work with childr en and social protection programmes.82 54. The evidence review points out that addressing partner vio lence can provide a way to reduce violence more broadly. Fi rst, because the family, where the majority of violent acts occur, is also where attitudes and beha viours are formed and transmitted between generations. Secondly, because many of the determinants of partner violence are the same as for other types of violenc e against women and girls and hence a focus on preventing partner violence can support preventing other fo rms of gender-based violence. It flags up specific interventions that evidence su ggests may work in redu cing partne r violence, including: work to change gender norms; parenting programmes to help address childhood exposure to violence; work on childhood health and developmen t, especially when targeted at adolescents; an d treatment of alcohol abuse.83 In our first evidence session, both Bernice Sam of the Ghanaian organization Women in Law and Development in Africa, and Annemarie Mave njina of Action Aid Tanzania , confirmed that domestic violence was the most prevalent form of abuse suffered by women in their countries and said that more must be done to address violence in families.84 Several written submissions 77 The most common form of violence in the home is perpetrated by men against their intimate partners. Nonetheless, it is also important to recognize that violence against child ren, including physical and sexual abuse of children in the home, is also a common occurrence and in some countries falls under the label of \"domestic violence\" or \"violence in the home\". This section focuses, however, on intimate partner violence. 78 Previous Select Committee reports on this subject include: Home Affairs Committee, Domestic Violence, Forced Marriage and \"Honour\"-Based Violence , Sixth Report of Session Ev Works Prevent Partner An Evidence (paper DFID) Ev L.Heise, Works Prevent Partner Violence: An Evidence Overview' (paper for DFID) 84 Q2 Violence Against Women and Girls 27 supported this and called on DFID to prioritise domest ic violence throug h its policy and programme work.85 55. We were pleased to see th at DFID has recently commiss ioned a review of evidence on partner violence, given th at domestic violence is the most widespread form of violence against women and girls suffered by women and girls worldwide. It is important that DFID's programmes seek to ta ckle domestic violence, and that they are targeted at household level, given that so cial norms and behavi ours are largely formed here. The review also indicates that DFID should seek better to integrate violence with its work with children and social protection programmes. In its response to this report, DFID should report back on its plans for programming in t his area in follow-up to the review. 85 Ev w85 28 Violence Against Women and Girls 4 Prioritising violence against women and girls in humanitarian and conflict settings 56. As part of its increased focus on viole nce against women and girls, DFID has paid particular attention to gender-b ased violence within humanita rian and conf lict settings. The UK Government has made sexual violence in conflict a key issu e during its 2013 presidency of the G8 . This chapter will a ssess both DFID, and wider UK Government, efforts in this area, and will ask how effective ly Whitehall department s are collaborating on the issue. Violence against women and gi rls in humanitarian contexts 57. There is evidence that rates of violence agai nst women and girls are particularly high in situations of armed conflict and humanitarian crises. Women an d girls are at high risk of physical, sexual and emotional violence from regular soldiers, no n-regular armed groups and militia, strangers, neighbou rs and family members. These risks are often co mpounded by the breakdown in structures of authority, disruption to service delivery, displacement and the rupture of families an d communities and thei r coping strategies. Rape and sexual violence are also used systematic ally as a tactic of war. Alth ough there is no comprehensive data on the extent of sexual violence in conf lict, it is esti mated that bet ween 20,000 and 50,000 women were raped during the Bosnian War, and that 200,000 Congolese women have been raped since 1998. Around 400,00 0 women were raped during the 100-day Rwandan genocide in 19 94. Although there is now internat ional legal recogn ition of rape as a war crime and a crime against humanity, in cluding in the statute of the International Criminal Court, prosecutions remain low. For example, there have only been 30 convictions for the up to 50,000 rapes perpetrated during the Bosnian war.86 58. Sexual violence has wide-ranging negati ve consequences for individual women and girls including p hysical trauma an d disease (including HIV/AI DS), psychological trauma, unwanted pregnancy and unsafe abortion, reduced school attenda nce, isolation and further abuse. It can also rupture family and community bonds and prevent women and girls from contributing to thei r families, communitie s and societies. Fina lly, where services are available, there are costs associated with providing various servic es to survivors of violence\u2014healthcare, psychosocial support, sh elter, economic suppor t, justice and legal services. Boys and men are also, of course, affected by sexual violence, in some cases because they are direct victims, in other cases because they witness se xual violence against women in their families and communities.87 As we noted following our visits to DRC (2011) and Afghanistan (2012), high levels of violence against women and girls and the conditions for conflict go togeth er. Recent research has foun d that countries which have high levels of violence against women and gi rls (including, for exampl e, domestic violence and female infanticide) are more likely to ex perience armed conflict than those which do 86 https://www.gov.uk/governm ent/speeches/a-new-focus-on- girls-and-womens-rights 87 Carpenter (2006).

In fact, levels of violence of against women were foun d to be a better predictor of state insecurity than factors such as levels of democracy or national wealth.88 59. Since 2000, the UN Security Council has ha d a Resolution in pl ace on women, peace and security (UNSCR 1325). The UK has recent ly developed a tri-de partmental National Action Plan (NAP) to help su pport the implementation of UN SCR 1325, and to strengthen the UK's ability to reduce the impact of conf lict on women and girls and to promote their inclusion in conf lict resolution.89 Witnesses argued that, wh ilst the NAP represented significant progress in enshrining intern ational commitments into national policy, accountability mechanisms were weak and there was still a sign ificant implementation gap. Amnesty International told us \"T he lack of reportin g against indicators an d a lack of time frames makes it difficult to assess whether the NAP is on course for completion at the end of its three year period\".90 Chitra Nagarajan, Director of Gender Action for Peace and Security, said the NAP must not \"remain in a nice document in London\" but must be \"integrated into the job descriptions of members of staff, performance indicators, and also into the work that is being done in-country\".91 DFID and violence against women and gi rls in humanitarian and conflict settings 60. DFID has worked for a number of years to address violence against women and girls in conflict settings and re-stated its commitment to this in the 2011 Humanitarian Emergency Response Review. On 4 March 2013, the Secretary of State for International Development, Rt Hon Justine Greening M P, delivered a speech pledging a \"new focus on girls and women's rights\", in which sh e committed to launch an international Call to Action to address violence against women an d girls in humanita rian situations, wi th a Summit in the autumn of 2013 that would \"bring agencies, donors and advo cates together to make sure that we up our game\".92 61. Witnesses to this inquiry welcomed this announcement.93 However, they stressed that it would be important for DF ID to work on all forms of violence that women and girls suffer in conflict and humanitarian situatio ns, rather than solely focusing on sexual violence.94 There is evidence to sugge st that intimate partner violence, child abuse, and rates of child marriage often increase in humanitarian and conf lict-affected situations.95 A recent International Rescue Committee report on Syria notes that\u2014as well as sexual 88 Ev w64 89 UN Security Council Resolution 1325 is a landmark international legal framewor k, agreed in 2000, that recognised the gendered dimensions of conflict\u2014that women and men, boys and girls experience different impacts from conflict and have different needs, and that this had implications for global peace and security. In 2004, the Secretary-General called on Member States to develop National Action Plans to ensure implementation of the Resolution. Twenty-two coun tries have now done this, including the UK. Th e FCO, DFID and MOD are equal partners in developing and implementing the National Action Plan. The UK NAP is being reviewed during 2013. 90 Ev w3 91 Q 89 92 Justine Greening, 'A new focus on girls and women's ri ghts', speech at Amnesty International, 4 March 2013 93 Q 70 94 Ev 83 95 Ev w51 30 Violence Against Women and Girls violence\u2014there have been accounts of women tr ading sex for food an d desperate families selling their girls into early marriage to re duce household numbers or pay rent, and that domestic violence in refugee co mmunities is also often exac erbated by the economic stress and poor living conditions .96 Accordingly, experts from the Lo ndon School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that DFID should \"broad en its focus from co nflict-related sexual violence to include th e full range of gender-based ab uses that displaced women and women in conflict experience\".97 62. It has also been suggest ed that the high-level focus on sexual violence in conflict areas can result in inadequate funding for ad dressing violence against women and girls elsewhere. For example, it has been argued that, in the DRC, the dominant focus on sexual violence in the conflict- affected East has led to a lack of policies and reso urces focused on the high levels of violence against women and girls perpetrated in th e rest of the country.98 Witnesses also said that more of DFID's fund ing should be targeted towards tackling the root causes of violence agai nst women and girls in humanitarian an d conflict settings\u2014 notably gender inequality an d discriminatory social norms\u2014 as well as on responding to survivor needs.99 It was also stressed that integrating programming to address violence against women and girl s into the response to humanit arian emergencies had the added benefit of helping to empower women to be part of efforts to rebuild thei r communities.100 63. We welcome the Secretary of State for International Development's Call to Action to address violence against women and gir ls in humanitarian situations, and her decision to hold a summit in Autumn 2013. Th ere is emerging evidence that tolerance of violence against women and girls makes countr ies more prone to conflict. This makes tackling the acceptance of violence against women and girls all the more important. We repeat our earl ier recommendation that DFID significantly increase its focus on social norms. Furth er, whilst the focus on sexu al violence in conflict is important, it must also be recognised that wome n and girls also suffe r from many other forms of violence in conflict and humanitar ian settings\u2014including higher rates of intimate partner viol ence, child abuse, an d child marriage. DFID should ensure that any new programming resulting fr om its Call to Action is su fficiently broad to include the full range of abus es that women and girls experience in crisis settings and that it addresses prevention in addition to response , by tackling the root causes of violence\u2014 including underlying gender inequalities and discriminatory social norms. Lifesaving services for women 64. Despite knowledge that levels of violen ce against women and girls are high in emergency situations, and the existence of international guidelines stating that it is a core protection issue, several wi tnesses stressed that violence against women and girls was 96 Ev 84 97 Ev w51 98 Eriksson Baaz, M. and M.

They also need specialist support to access justice and economic support.102 65. Furthermore, where populations have been disp laced, it is important to engage in early preventative work (for example, lo cation of water and sanitation facilities, firewood patrols, distributing stoves, creating safe spaces), wh ich can make a big difference to the security risks faced by women and girls. The International Resc ue Committee to ld us that its research across five emergencies found that violence ag ainst women and girls accounted for only 1-4% of requested funding in each.103 We were especially shocked to hear that refugee camps recently construc ted by UN agencies in Ma li fell short of very basic benchmarks for safeguarding wom en, such as lockable latr ines and safe access to firewood.104 It is therefore a positi ve first step that the UN High Commissioner for Refugees has committed to co mprehensive gender-based vio lence programmes in 24 situations by 2014.105 66. Marie Stopes International ag reed that ensuring an effective, integrated response to violence against wo men and girls and providi ng effective sexual an d reproductive health rights services were key neglected areas in emergency contexts. They, along with several other witnesses, urged DFID urge ntly to take action in this area. For examp le, Kerry Smith of Plan UK told us What we would like to see is a real commitment from [D FID], saying, \"Along with those shelter, health and food specialists on that first plane, there will also be gender- based violence specialists and child protection specialists. We value it at that level; we see it as a lifesaving intervention.\" Th at message coming from DFID, as such a significant donor in the humanitari an setting, would be very useful.106 However, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) commented that understanding of why and how responses to and pr evention of violence agains t women and girls needed to be prioritised as a lifesaving measure in emergencie s was still weak across DFID\u2014 including at the coun try level and with hu manitarian advisers.107 They said that this should be a priority area for change for DFID. 67. Sir John Holmes, ex-UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, and IRC Board Memb er, told us that DF ID should use its 101 Inter Agency Standing Committee, Guidelines for Gender-Based Violence interventions in Humanitarian Settings (2005), cited in Ev 85 102 IRC, 'Lifesaving, not optional: Protecting women and girls from violence in emergencies', Ditchley Park conference discussion paper, Oct 2012, p.3 103 Ev 85 104 Informal discussions with DFID and UN Women staff 105 Ev 95 106 Q 73 107 Ev 86 32 Violence Against Women and Girls leverage with multilateral a id agencies\u2014particularly UNHCR, the World Food Programme and UNICEF\u2014to change their approach to violence against women and girls:108 He who pays the piper calls the tune. If dono rs come and say to an agency, \"This is what we want you to do \", and implicitly or explicitly say, \"and if you do not do it, you will not get as much mo ney as you did befo re\", that works. [...] If there was one single thing that DFID should do [...] it is to insist, when they are dealing with UN agencies, NGOs and so on in their funding decisions, that they will not fund unless [violence against women and girls], is a priority in th eir programmes [...] there should be reporting on what th ey have done to address this.109 Similarly, in written evidence the IRC re commended that the UK Government should \"routinely ask multilaterals to report back on how they are tackling violence against women and girls as part of their monitoring frameworks\".110 They said that under DFID's 2011 Multilateral Aid Review (MAR ), \"very few\" partners were assessed on gender, \"let alone their commitment to preventing and re sponding to violence against women and girls\".111 When we put this to DFID, it agreed t hat violence against women and girls had not been assessed in the 2011 MAR, but said it would be included in the next review.112 68. The IRC recommended that DFID should make gender and vio lence against women and girls priority issues in the reform of several UN agencies. Th ey further recommended that addressing violence ag ainst women and girls and acco untability to gender-based violence guidelines should be key criteria for DFID when channelling and disbursing humanitarian funds, incl uding via pooled funds.113 Similarly, Marie St opes recommended that the UK work with the UN humanitari an coordination sy stem, including the Consolidated Appeals Process, to ensure greater priority was given to humanitarian programmes that enabled the provision of sexual and re productive he alth services.114 69. Levels of violence against women and girls, especial ly sexual violence, are particularly high during humanitarian em ergencies. Yet the evidence shows that\u2014 despite international guidelines\u2014vital pr eventative and emergency responses to violence against women and gir ls are not accorded enough priority by donors at the onset of humanitarian crises. DFID must make tackling violenc e against women and girls a central part of its humanitarian pr ogramming, highlighting the importance of focusing on violence against women and girls in the immediate onset of an emergency, and advocating the delivery of lifesaving services (such as sexual and reproductive healthcare) to survivors of violence as well as preventative measur es such as safely situated water and sanitation facilities, fire wood patrols, distributing stoves and the creation of safe spaces. 108 Q 78 109 Qq 73 and 75 110 Ev 83 111 http://www.dfid.gov.uk/Do cuments/Multila to collective such as th e UK's tri-departme Pool. 114 Ev w54. The Consolidated A ppeals Process is an advocacy tool for humanitarian financing, in which projects managed by stakeholders such as the UN and NGOs come together to approach the donor community for funding. Violence Against Women and Girls 33 70. DFID must also get t ough with multilateral aid agencies which, we hear, continue to ignore basic measures for safeguarding women in refugee camps and other displacement sites. DFID must send a clear me ssage to the ma jor relief agen cies that its funding of them is contingent on violence against women and girl s being pushed to the top of the list of emergency measures in crisis response. DFID should also include gender and violence against wo men and girls as key strategic priorities for the reform processes of UN humanitarian and relief agencies. We r ecommend that accountability to gender-based v iolence guidelines should be key cr iteria for DFID when channelling and disbursing humanitarian funds, includin g via pooled funds. We recommend that DFID include violence against women and gir ls in its next multilateral aid review. The Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative 71. The Preventing Sexual Viole nce in Conflict In itiative (PSVI) was announced by Foreign Secretary Rt Ho n William Hague MP in 2012 (for details see Box 4). The Initiative aims to increase the number of perpetrators br ought to justice, and su pport states' capacity to prosecute acts of sexual violence committed during conflict . Its activities include the deployment of 73 mult i-disciplinary experts overseas to support efforts to gather evidence and testimony that can be used in investigations and prosecutions. The first deployment\u2014 to Syria's borders to train local health professi onals in how to respon d to reports of sexual violence\u2014took place in December 2012. So far, deployments have also been made to Bosnia-Herzegovina and to Libya. Further depl oyments are planned to eastern DRC, to Mali, and South Sudan. 115 The PSVI is part of wider engagement on sexual violence in conflict during the UK Presidency of the G8. This includes a propos ed new international protocol on the invest igation and documentatio n of sexual violence in conflict\u2014aimed at improving the evidence base for prosecutio ns\u2014which we understand the UK hopes to raise at the UN Security Council in June (when it ho lds the presidency of the Council), and at the UN General Asse mbly in September. Box 4: The Preventing Sexual Violen ce in Conflict Initiative (PSVI) - The PSVI was launched by the Foreign Secret ary, Rt Hon William Hague MP, in May 2012. - It aims to increase the numbe r of perpetrators brought to justice, and support states' capacity to prosecute acts of sexual violence committed during conflict. - Its activities include the depl oyment of 73 multi-disciplinary experts overseas to support efforts to gather evidence and testimony that can be used in investigations and prosecutions. - The experts include police, la wyers, psychologists, doctors, forensic experts, gender-based violence experts and experts in th e care and protection of surviv ors and witnesses. They will also provide training and mentoring to nationa l authorities and work with grassroots and human rights organisations. - The PSVI has been a part of the G8 Agenda for 2013. A 'Declaration on Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict' was adopted by G8 Foreign Ministers on 11 April 2013. 115 Ev 79 34 Violence Against Women and Girls 72. On 10-11 April 2013, G8 fore ign ministers endorsed the declaration on preventing sexual violence in co nflict. They confirmed that rape and other fo rms of serious sexual violence in armed conflic t were war crimes and constituted \"grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions\". The UK Government announced a further \u00a310 millio n (\u00a35 million each from FCO and DFID). The DFID allocation was part of the Re search and Innovation Fund on violence against women and girls. DFID said the money would \"fund work in up to five countries, looking at what drives and causes violence against women and girls in emergency and co nflict settings\".116 Scope of the PSVI 73. Evidence to the inquiry broadl y welcomed the PSVI as an opportunity for the UK Government to put violence against women and girls high on the G8 agenda. However, many organisations expressed concerns about it s narrow focus. First, there was a concern that (despite the title), the main focus of efforts was on response not prevention.117 Secondly, in terms of response, Christian A id questioned the emphasis on increasing investigations and pros ecutions through the formal syst em, rather than on delivering comprehensive services to supp ort survivors and wom en's access to jus tice more widely (including through informal systems).118 The Gender and Develop ment Network pointed to evidence that unless women have su stained support (legal, economic and psychosocial)\u2014and protection from pote ntial backlash\u2014cases will be dropped.119 Thirdly, there is a concern that the initiative might compound th e growing disconnect between work on sexual violence in conflict and work on violence against wo men and girls more generally\u2014including tack ling the root causes of violence, recognis ing diverse forms of violence against women an d girls in conflic t settings, and understa nding the links between violence against women and girls in pre-, post- and non-conflict settings.120 74. When we put these concerns to DFID Parl iamentary Under Secret ary of State Lynne Featherstone MP, she said that the PSVI was \"upping the ante \" on violence against women and girls generally, and that the discussions it generated with developing country governments went beyond sexual violence in conflict to encompass wider concerns relating to violence against women and girls.121 75. We welcome the Foreign Secretary's Preventi ng Sexual Violence Initiative. As the Initiative progresses from its initial ince ption phase, we recommend a broadening in scope to include: first, more emphasis on prevention (rather than response); secondly, a greater focus on survivor support services in addition to work on formal investigations and prosecutions; and fi nally, ensuring a li nk to wider work on different forms of violence against women and girls, addressing root causes of violence. We recommend 116 FCO Press Notice, 11 Ap ril 2013, 'UK announces addi tional funding to address c onflict and M. Stern (2010) 'The Complexity of Violence: A critical analysis of sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo'. Nordiska Afrikainstitutet and SIDA 121 Q 182 Violence Against Women and Girls 35 that, in the Government's Resp onse to this report, it sets out how it might broaden the Initiative in the future to include these points. Access to justice 76. Access to justice is not just about prosecutions but about supporting women to access justice. If the PSVI is to be su ccessful, it will be ne cessary for it to pro vide this support and help build confidence in the justice system. If victim s do not have confidence that the justice system will provide them with support, safety and justice then they are unlikely to make the decision to report an offence.122 DFID has ple dged to provide access for 10 million women by 2015.123 DFID supports projects such as the UN Women-run Security and Justice for Women progr amme (US$3.4m, 2011-14) in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPTs). The project supports Palestinian women's vict ims' access to justice by setting up a system of specia lised professionals, including from the ju dicial and security sectors, capable of dealing with violence against women and gi rls from a gender perspective and in accordance with rule of law.124 ActionAid suggested that the work of the PSVI could help with DFID's work on justice, as could the forthcom ing DFID publication of a Theory of Change on using security and justice programming to tackle violence against women and girls.125 Access to justice is vital fo r women and girls suffering violence, including access to legal advice. We credit DFID for seeking to provide access to justice for 10 mill ion women by 2015. The PSVI ha s concentrated on prosecutions, but in addition it is import ant to talk about ways of fa cilitating wome n's access to justice. We urge the UK Gove rnment to ensure that the PS VI supports women to access justice as well as increasi ng prosecutions. We look forward to the forthcoming publication of DFID's Theory of Change on using security and justice programming to tackle violence ag ainst women and girls, and recomm end this document spells out in detail DFID's appr oach to this crucial workstream. Cross-departmental co-ordination on the PSVI 77. Ministers have stated that DFID has an important role to play in the PSVI.126 A DFID member of staff has been seco nded to the PSVI team since August 2012. The project team is supported by a cros s-Whitehall working group that me ets monthly, which is in turn overseen by an external Steering Group which pulls together what the FCO terms a \"broad base of expertis e\" on preventing sexual violen ce in conflict.127 However, the Associate Parliamentary Group on Women, Peace and Security stated that, \"it remains unclear how DFID fits into the initiative\".128 Womankind said it was uncertain how communication and joint-working between the departments \"is happening in practice\".129 Witnesses felt it 122 Ev Ev 88 124 Ev w76 125 Ev 63-64 126 For example, Q Ev 78 128 Ev w9 129 Ev w85 36 Violence Against Women and Girls was important for the Government to articula te DFID's role so that the initiative capitalised on DFID's expertise on tackling violence against women and girls. They stressed that this was especially important if a holistic approach to addressing violence\u2014 addressing root causes and soci al norms\u2014was to be achieved.130 Also, as Sir John Holmes highlighted, it is DFID that is responsible for providing servic es on the ground: The Foreign Office can highlight or spearhead this kind of initiative, but the services on the ground are not their job, and will not be their job. [...] DFID will have to run with the consequence of it , and run with the practica l projects, pr ogramming and funding on the ground over the long term.131 In order to assist co-ordination, Amnesty International recommended that DFID \"adequately resource [PSVI work] it in all its operational pla ns and strategies for countries affected by violent conflict\".132 Save the Children suggested th at it would be helpful if DFID could take the lead on convening a donor meeting on se xual violence as a follow-up to the G8 Foreign Ministers meeting in April.133 We asked the FCO Senior Minister of State, Baroness Warsi, about cross-departmental co-ordinat ion on the PSVI . She said she was confident that there was sufficient \"buy-in\" to the PSVI from across UK Government departments to ensure it wa s a priority \"right to the end of this Government\".134 78. It is imperative that th e UK Government stands by its commitment to sustain momentum on the PSVI beyond the 2013 G8 Presidency. However, to be taken forward effectively, the Initiative must include a clea rer articulation of DFID's role so that the Department's expertis e is fully utilised. The FCO, whilst providing admirable leadership, does not have the mandate or knowledge to undertake pr ogramming to address violence agains t women and girls and delivery of women's services on the ground\u2014it is DFID that posses ses this experti se. We anticipate that the DFID Secretary of State's recent 'Call to Action' and her planned autumn summit on violence against women and girls in humanitar ian settings will provide opportunities for embedding the PSVI within DFID's work. We recommen d that, in its respon se, the Government spell out specific details of DFID's future involvement in the PSVI, including details of budgets and staffing. 130 Ev w65 131 Q 86 132 Ev w3 133 Ev w68 134 Q 135 and Q 134 Violence Against Women and Girls 37 The role of peacekeepers 79. Tackling violence against wom en and girls via pe acekeeping operations is an important route to addressing ge nder-based violence in conflict settings.135 Evidence we received recommended that the UK Government should continue to lobby at the UN for peacekeepers to be properly trained in preventing and re sponding to violence against women and girls,136 and for any peacekeepers that co mmit abuses to be held to account.137 Tearfund recommended that the Ministry of Defence (MOD) should strengthen the training provided to British personnel on violence agains t women and girls.138 Chitra Nagarajan of Gender Action on Peace and Security (GAPS) recommended that peacekeepers consult with women in communities about the nature of threats. She said the deployment of an all-female contingent of peacekeepers in Liberia had worked well because women felt more able to come and talk to them abou t threats to their personal security.139 Baroness Warsi said that the proper training of peacekeeping missions had been emphasised by the PSVI. She agreed that it would be \"positiv e\" for the UK to be involved in training peacekeeping troops.140 We recommend that the UK Government continue to lobby at the UN for peacekeepers to be properly trained in preventing and responding to violence agai nst women and girls, and for any peacekeepers that commit abuses to be held to account. Further, we believe that the UK should also strengthen the training on violence against women and girls it provides its own troops, and to the peacekeeping forces that the MOD helps tr ain. In the reply to this report, the Government should stat e what steps the Secr etary of State for Defence is taking to deliver effective tr aining in respect of violen ce against women and girls. Abortions for women raped in conflict 80. Girls and women raped in situations of ar med conflict are considered the \"wounded and sick\" with inaliena ble rights to no n-discriminatory medical care under the Geneva Conventions. However, because the restrictions placed on the use of aid for purposes of abortion by a number of major donors\u2014m ost notably the US\u2014humanitarian services often exclude providing abortions to girls and wome n raped in armed conflict. 81. In a recent debate in the House of Lords, Baroness Northover, Le ad Spokesperson for DFID in the House of Lords, stated: Parties to an armed conflict are obliged to provide all wo unded and sick victims of armed conflict with humane treatment. To the extent pr acticable and with the least possible delay, they are obliged to provide th e medical care and at tention required by the given condition without discrimination except on medical grounds. This includes appropriate life-saving medical care which, in our view, may include the 135 Ev w64 136 Q76 137 Q 80 138 Ev w74 139 Q 80 140 Q 136 38 Violence Against Women and Girls provision of aborti on to women raped in conflict if it is deemed medically necessary.141 However, the NGO Global Justice Center (GJC) told us that this statement recognising the special rights of women raped in wa r under humanitarian law has yet to be incorporated into the rele vant DFID policies. It told us this included the \"Safe and unsafe abortion\" Practice Paper, which limits th e provision of DFID support for abortion services strictly to situations where ab ortion is legal un der national law.142 GJC said: In order better to support programming to address violence against women and girls in humanitarian aid, DFID sh ould issue a clear policy stat ement on abortion and war victims to supplement exis ting policy st atements, which makes cl ear that th e right to abortion for girls and wom en raped in armed conf lict is protected under international humanitarian law (IHL) and is not subject to national laws on abortions. Such a policy should require that DFID-fu nded medical programs in humanitarian settings inform girls and women raped and impregnated in armed conflict of their rights under IHL including their right to abortion as a component of non-discriminatory medical care.143 The International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF ) focused their appeal on the US Government, who they said must \"treat women and girls impregnated by war rape without discrimination and provide them with complete medical ser vices including safe abortion when medically necessary\".144 82. Certain donor agencies continue to restrict the use of thei r funds for the purposes of abortions for women raped duri ng conflict. DFID has stated that th e lifesaving care promised under the Geneva Conventions may sometime s include the provision of abortions to women raped in conflict if deemed medically necessary. However, this position has yet to be incorporated into the relevant DFID po licies. We recommend that DFID issue a clear policy statement spe lling out the extent and limits of its support for abortion for women raped in war. We also recommend th at DFID engage in serious dialogue with donors that restrict the use of their funds for abortion \u2014notably the US Government \u2014to ensure that women ra ped in humanitarian conf lict settings can access the services they need, including abortion. DFID should work with its counterparts in the US, and with agencies aff ected by the US ban, such as the ICRC, to ensure that women raped in humanitarian conflict settin gs can access the services they need, including abortion. 141 Lords Hansard, 9 Jan 2013: Column w34 144 Ev w93 Violence Against Women and Girls 39 5 Strengthening DFID's institutional capacity and international leadership on violence against women and girls The UK Government's internationa l leadership on violence against women and girls 83. It is clear that the UK Gove rnment has carved out an inte rnational leadership role on violence against women and girls. This received wi despread praise from many organisations who submitted evidence to this inquiry. Kerry Smith of Plan UK said of recent efforts to address viole nce against women and girls: What it has achieved is a real UK Governm ent vision. We are th e champions globally of violence against women and girls, and th at is not to be sn iffed at. That is something quite powerful.145 Witnesses were very keen that this leadership position be sustained. Kerry Smith said \"We hope that [...] results from the Foreign Ministers' Meeting in April [...] lead into some significant commitments by donor colleagues in the humanitarian summit in the Autumn\".146 As discussed above, we believe that sustaining and broadening the PSVI, and embedding it within DFID, is an important priority going forward. However, there are a number of other key opportunities for strength ening the UK's international leadership on violence against women and gi rls\u2014including the need to ensure that DFID has the organisational capacity to deliver\u2014which we will discuss in this chapter. The UK's role in tack ling violence against wo men and girls through the UN system UN Women 84. A number of UN agencies , including UN Women, th e UN Children's Agency (UNICEF), the UN Population Fund (UNFP A), the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and the World Health Organisation (WHO) work on violence against women and girls. The UN Entity for Gender Equality and the Em powerment of Women\u2014UN Women, created in 2010\u2014is the designated coordinator in the UN system for the Secretary-General's multi- year UNiTE to End Violence Against Women campaign. It also manages the UN Trust Fund to End Violence against Women. The UK's core contribution to UN Women is currently \u00a310 million per annum, making the UK the single larg est core contributor to UN Women in 2012.147 145 Q 83 146 Q 83 147 Ev 95 40 Violence Against Women and Girls 85. UN Women's creation was part of the UN re form agenda, bringing together different resources and mandates on gend er equality for greater impact.148 The UK was among the Member States who actively contributed to th e establishment of UN Women and, according to UN Women, \"continue s to be a strong supporter\".149 Violence against women and girls is one of UN Women's six focus area s. It works at both a policy and programme level through advocacy campaign s and partnerships with othe r UN agencies, governments and civil society. Its wor k ranges from supporti ng the development of national laws, policies and action plan s on violence ag ainst women and girls to community-leve l work on prevention and response. As we ll as providing core funding, DFID has also funded the UN Women Peace and Security Programme (\u00a3 3.25m between 2010 and March 2013), to ensure women's role in peace an d security nati onally and globally. DF ID told us that, thus far, it had provided \u00a32.135m , which had been divided bet ween UN Women projects in Haiti, Liberia, Timor-Les te and Uganda, as well as providing critical suppo rt to activities at the global level.150 UN Women also receives a DFID grant to strengthen policing and justice services for women victims of violenc e in the Occupied Pa lestinian Te rritories (\u00a33.3m over 3 financial years).151 86. UN Women welcomed the \"extensive cons ultation\" between DF ID and UN Women during the formulation of the new DFID Th eory of Change on violence against women and girls and related programming guidance.152 They made the following suggestions for future collaboration be tween the two agencies: - a \"more long-term, systematic collaborati on\" on violence agai nst women and girls between DFID and UN Wo men to develop a compre hensive programme and strategy, including pilot programmes in selected countrie s to test different approaches; - to continue to improve the evidence base for violence against women and girls, and to \"actively involve\" UN Wo men in DFID's Research and Innovation Fund on violence against women and girls; and - to \"encourage continuity of funding\" at th e country level, especia lly in su pporting women's organizations.153 87. We support DFID's continued core funding of UN Women, which is an important way of ensuring pr edictability and continuit y at the country level, especially with regard to the regular funding it enables UN Wome n t o g i v e t o w o m e n ' s organisations. We agree with UN Women's suggestion that DFID should establish a longer-term, closer collaboration on violence against women and girls with the agency, including the 148 UN Women merged and built upon work of four previously distinct parts of th e UN system which focused exclusively on gender equality and women's empowerment: Division for the Advancement of Women; International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women; Office of the Special Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women; United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM). 149 Ev w75 150 w76 153 Ev w78 Violence Against Women and Girls 41 development of a joint violence against wo men and girls strategy. This would help DFID to capitalise on the technical expertis e and country-le vel experience on violence against women and girls within UN Women, at a time when its own ability to employ extra staff is limited. The Commission on the Status of Women, and the Post-2015 Framework 88. The 57th Commission on the Status of Wo men (CSW 57) was he ld in New York from 4-13 March 2013, with the theme \"Elimination and prevention of all forms of violence against women and girls\" . Following the failure to reach agreed conclusions at CSW 56 in 2012, this year's meeting was viewed as critical to ensure the ongoing prioritisation of violence against women and gir ls. The outcomes of CSW 57 were seen as largely successful, despite the fact that negotiations were repeatedly threatened by attempts by some delegations to roll back language on women's rights in previous international agreements.154 The outcome document included stro ng language on the promotion of gender equality, women's empowerment and en suring women's reproductive rights and access to sexual and reproducti ve health services\u2014including for marginalised groups such as indigenous women, older women, women with disabilitie s, migrant women and women in custody. Notable was new language recommending provision of emergency contraception for wome n victims of rape as well as call for comprehensive sex education. There was also a specific ca ll for protection for women's hu man rights defenders, who often face violence an d backlash. It also emphasised the need to end harmful traditional practices, including early marriage.155 89. The UK Government's stated goal for CSW was \"to agree a common set of global standards to protect women and girls from discrimination and violence\".156 The lead UK department on CSW was the Government Equali ties Office, with support from DFID and the FCO. UN Women told us that DFID had played an \"active role\" in convening and supporting the preparatory processes leading up to CSW 57, including by organising the UK Government's preparator y meeting for CSW in Novemb er 2012. FCO co-ordinated two international lobbying campaigns with govern ments to \"soften opposition\" to some of the more progressive language in the outcome text.157 UN Women suggested that a major opportunity for DFID following CSW would be to support national implementation of the CSW \"agreed conclusions\" through specific technical assistance programmes at global, regional and country levels .158 154 'UN conference on women: some rights won, but more battles ahead', Rowan Harvey, Guardian Global Development , 20 March 2013, online at http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty- matters/2013/mar/20/un-conference-women-rights-won 155 CSW 158 Ev w78 42 Violence Against Women and Girls 90. Other witnesses believed that the UK should look beyond the event itself to \"set a progressive, action-oriented ag enda for the longer-term\".159 They saw work on the post- 2015 framework that will replace the MDGs as vital to keep women's rights and violence against women and girls on the international agenda. Violence ag ainst women and girls was not included in the original MDG framew ork and many submissions stressed that it should be highlighted as a priori ty issue for th e new framework\u2014specific ally, that it should be one of the indicators measured under a proposed standalone goal on gender.160 The post-2015 framewo rk will be the theme of next year 's CSW 58 and UN Women confirmed that it was calling for a \"subst antive, stand-alone gender equa lity goal, that would address ending violence against women and girls tog ether with other dimensions of gender equality and empowerment of wo men, as well as the full integra tion of gender equality in all other goals throug h gender sensitive ta rgets and indicators.\"161 DFID's Secretary of State also indicated her support for a standalone gender goal d uring her speech on 4 March 2013.162 UN Women said it had been consultin g closely with DFID on the future framework .163 91. In our report on 'The Post-2015 Developme nt Goals', published in January 2013, we said that women's rights should be \"explicitly set out in quantitative detail\" in the Post- 2015 goals. We also recommende d that data used in the Fr amework be disaggregated by gender (and by other va riables as appropriate).164 92. On 30 May 2013, just before our report was agreed, Secr etary-General Ban Ki-moon published the report of his H igh Level Panel (HLP) on Post -2015. The report contained a set of \"Illustrative Goals and Targets\". The se cond of these was a stand-alone gender goal seeking to \"Empower girl s and women and achieve gender equality\", with sub-targets of: i) preventing and eliminating all forms of violence against wome n and girls; ii) ending child marriage; iii) ensuring the eq ual right of women to own an d inherit property, sign a contract, register a business and open a bank acco unt; and iv) elimin ating discrimination against women in politica l, economic, and public life.165 93. We are pleased that DFID, together with the Governme nt Equalities Office and the FCO, played an active role in securing what was generally co nsidered a positive outcome to the UN Commission on the Status of Women earlier this year (CSW 57). We urge the UK Government to now focus on following up the event. Key priorities should be to support implementation of conclu sions, particular at country level, and to engage in early prepa ratory work for CSW 58 in 2014, which wi ll focus on the post- 2015 framework to replace the MDGs.

We very much welcome the inclusion of the targets to end violence against women and prevent child marriage. We were also pleased to see that the HLP heeded our calls for gender equality to be integrated across all of the goals. We urge the UK Prime Minister and Secretary of State for International Development to push for these \"illustrative goals and targets\" to be retained in the final post-2015 framework at all costs. Strengthening DFID's ro le to deliver on violen ce against women and girls The Ministerial Champion for Tackling Violence Against Women and Girls Overseas 94. DFID Parliamentary Under Se cretary of State Lynne Feat herstone MP is the UK's International Ministerial C hampion for Tackli ng Violence Agains t Women and Girls Overseas. The purpose of the role is to repr esent the UK in policy and programme work to tackle violence against women and girls overseas and to ens ure policy coherence and co- ordination across Whitehall Departments. Her priority areas for 20 13 were: Prevention and building the global evidence ba se on what works to tackle violence against women and girls (for example, through a recently -launched DFID Research and Innovation Fund of up to \u00a325 million); Eradication of female genital mutilation; Tackling all forms of violence against wom en and girls in humanitarian crisis and conflict situations. Implementation of the National Action Plan on UNSCR 1325 and support to the Foreign Secretary's PSVI.166 DFID's written eviden ce announced new governance arrangements under which DFID would chair a steering group of officials from the Home O ffice, Governme nt Equalities Office (GEO), FCO and MOD to support th e International Champion and provide cross- Government co-ordination.167 95. The role of the International Ministeria l Champion was welcomed in the written evidence as the first po st of its kind in the world. Ac tionAid said the Champion had \"a critical role to play [...] especi ally as its mandate covers the work of all the international departments\u2014DFID, the FCO and the MoD\".168 However, concerns were expressed over whether the Ministerial Champion has an ad equate mandate and staffing to drive a renewed cross-Government st rategy on violence against wo men and girls. The Orchid Project said the role did no t always have \"respect it sh ould have\" across Whitehall.169 166 Ev Ev 88 168 Ev 63 169 Ev w57 44 Violence Against Women and Girls 96. The Gender and Development Network saw the role as a pote ntial linchpin for a \"coherent and coordinated cr oss-government approach to addressing violence against women and girls in ternationally\u2014inc luding all development, conflict, security and humanitarian agendas\". It re commended a revision of the international section of the Cross-Government Strategy on violence against wome n and girls, and a dding a framework for monitoring impacts, to a lign it with DFID's new Theo ry of Change for Tackling Violence against Women and Gi rls and related guidance.170 Several NGOs sought assurances that the role had \"the access, authorit y and resources to dr ive this strategy forward across Government, especially acro ss the FCO, DFID an d MOD\", and said it should report annually to Parliament on progress.171 97. We welcome the UK Government's establ ishment of the role of Ministerial Champion for Tackling Violence Against Wo men and Girls Overseas , the first of its kind internationally. The role offers the chance to improve policy coherence across departments\u2014especially DFID, the FCO and the MOD\u2014and to reinforce the UK's international strategy on violence against women and girls. However, in order to do this the role must be pro perly resourced. We recommend the creation of a small unit, adequately staffed, and the in troduction of an annual Parliamentary reporting cycle, that together will formalise the role and enhance its strength. DFID's internal organisation 98. DFID has a relatively small violence against women and gir ls team within its Conflict, Humanitarian and Securi ty Department (CHASE).172 It also has a separate Gender team within DFID's Policy Division, which oversees the implem entation of the Strategic Vision on Girls and Women across DFID. Although several witnesses welco med the work done by the violence against women and girls team,173 several concerns we re expressed with regard to structure and staffing. First, some witnesses questioned the location of the violence against women an d girls team within a subsection of CHASE. Witnesses said that this risked \"silo-ing\" violence against women and girls as a humanitarian and/or security issue, and ignored the \"clear rationale for vital work on vio lence against women and girls by other teams\", given the multi-sectoral emphasis in th e Theory of Change and related guidance.174 ActionAid suggested that DFID revive it s Gender Equality Action Plan (GEAP)\u2014a cross-department strategy in place from 2007-10\u2014as a \"useful tool for ensuring cross team co-ordination on women's rights is sues and to strengthen its emphasis and actions on violence against women and girls\".175 The GEAP set out a concerted programme of ways in which gender would be \"mainstreamed\" across the Department, involving all parts of DFID. It included the appointment of \"gender full-time staff (Ev 96). 173 Q 94 174 Ev 62 175 Ev 60. Gender 2007.pdf . The GEAP was Strategic Vision for Girls and Women (2011-2015). DFID, GEAP: Third Progress Report (2009-10). Violence Against Women and Girls 45 within different parts of the orga nisation, including top management.176 NGOs told us that, when it was discontinued, the GEAP was \"widely felt\" to be a loss by civil society.177 99. Secondly, submissions expres sed concern that, given DFID 's increasing focus on violence against women and girls, the current te am was small and its staff overworked.178 DFID has attempted to boost av ailable resources by setting up a viol ence against women and girls helpdesk, sta ffed by external experts, so that country office staff can obtain additional expertise on violenc e against women and girls. The main purpose of this is a \"call-down\" function whereby DFID staff can receive b oth technica l advice and programming support from expe rts on issues connected with violence against women and girls, including throug h in-country visits.179 Whilst these efforts to expand capacity were welcomed in evidence, Womankind pointed out that it was \"likely to be less effective [than building capacity in-house] in forging the lo nger-term commitment and capacity of staff across the organisation to address violence against women and girls\".180 100. A third area of concern wa s that knowledge on violence against women and girls was insufficient amongst co untry programme staff. Chitra Nagara jan, Director of Gender Action for Peace and Security, said that work on violence against wo men and girls \"is not institutionalised at the country level: it happens rath er at an ad hoc le vel\". She suggested violence against women an d girls training for all DFID staf f needed to be \"pushed out [...] as a priority\". Sir John Holmes of IRC agreed, saying that in-country staff needed to have violence against women an d girls training and gu idance \"built into what they do right from the beginning\", and that it \"need s to be a real priority, not a box-ticking priority, for them to make sure it happ ens on the ground.\"181 The IRC suggested that \"DFID should consider a minimum training on violence against women and girls before staff can be deployed overseas\".182 101. When we asked DFID about its staffing, it said that it was curre ntly reviewing the violence against women an d girls team structure \"to reflect new priorities\" but that this would not result in an increase in overall fu ll time equivalent staff, but rather a \"slight reconfiguration of grades and technical skills\".183 On the location of the violence against women and girls team within CHASE, DFID said that the team worked \"very closely\" with the gender team, \"to ensure synergies are maximised\".184 Regarding staff in country offices, DFID said that its cadre of mo re than 80 Social Development Advisers were re sponsible for leading work to address violence against wo men and girls across country programmes and 176 DFID, GEAP: Third Progress Report (2009-10), p.4 177 Ev 62 and Ev w85 178 Q 93 179 Discussions with DFID VAWG team, 24 May 2013 180 Ev w85 181 Q 93 182 Ev 86 183 Ev 96 184 Ev 97 46 Violence Against Women and Girls that the relevant skills for working on viole nce against women and gir ls would be enhanced through continued professional development.185 102. We believe that, in order to sustain its impressive international leadership on violence against women and girls, DFID must address it s staffing and knowledge base. DFID should keep the both the size, and the location of its violence against women and girls team, under review to ensure that its resources are appropri ately matched to the increasing focus on violen ce against women and girls within the Department. DFID should consider re-a ctivating its Gender Eq uality Action Plan \u2014dropped in 2010 \u2014as a useful tool for ensuring that staff across the orga nisation in Headqu arters and country offices have strong kn owledge and capacities to work on gender and issues connected with violence agains t women and girls. 103. We welcome DFID's efforts to expand its technical capacity on violence against women and girls via the new helpdesk, but this is no subs titute for strengthening the in- house capacity of staff. It is especially important to incr ease the capacity of country programme staff, who are responsible for the actual implementation of programmes to address violence agains t women and girls. Training and guidance must go beyond box-ticking to be a re al priority for all DFID staff. We agree with witnesses that DFID should consider a minimum tr aining on violence against women and girls before staff can be deployed overseas. 185 Ev 97-98 Violence Against Women and Girls 47 6 Conclusions 104. Through the Strategic Vi sion for Girls and Wo men, the Theory of Change on violence against women and girls, and the accompanyin g 'How To' notes, DFID has an excellent policy and programming framework in place. Crucially, it also has strong political leadership on the issue. Recent speeches by the Secretary of State communicate her passion to turn the tide an d reduce violence against women and girls gl obally. The fact that a second DFID Minister also has a high-level ma ndate on this issue is a clear statement of DFID's\u2014and the UK Government's\u2014intenti on to drive change. Given the Foreign Secretary's current prioritisation of sexual viol ence in conflict, it really does seem that\u2014as DFID said to us\u2014\"th e stars are aligned\".186 The Prime Minister's membership of the High Level Panel on the Post-2015 De velopment Agenda means that there is a real opportunity to ensure that a gender goal\u2014including a specific target on violence against women and girls\u2014is a core part of the post-2015 fram ework replacing the Millennium Development Goals, as recommended by the re port of the High Level Panel on Post-2015, published in May 2013. 105. We conclude this report by crediting the UK Government for putting st rong policies and increased programmin g and leadership in place to make its aspiration of tackling violence against women and girls ov erseas a real possibility. However, as we have made clear, we believe the pr iority now is to put policy into practice. There are four main challenges that DFID needs to meet in order to do this: Delivering programmes to address violence against women and girls that align with the policy framework and Theory of Change, includin g: more programmes that address the underlying social norms that drive violence; more cross-sector programmes; and an increase in the nu mber of countries in which violence against women and girls is identified as a strategic priority for DFID; Addressing pervasive, ev eryday forms of violence against women and girls such as female genital mutilation , child marriage and domest ic violence; yet remaining aware of the need not to rush into la rge-scale programming to address violence against women and girls with out the evidence ba se\u2014instead to engage in flexible, long-term programming with realistic ex pectations about time frames and results; Making tackling violence against women and girls a central part of DFID's humanitarian programming, so that prevention and response to violence against women and girls (especially the provision of lifesaving services) are prioritised following the immediate onset of an emergency, and demanding the same response from multilatera l partners; ensuring that all forms of violence against women and girls are measured and ad dressed in conflic t-affected and humanitarian situation with a focus on prevention and the root causes; and 186 Informal discussions with DFID, 24 May 2013 48 Violence Against Women and Girls Continuing to strengthen the UK's international leadership on violence against women and girls, paying attention to the need to underpin this role with sufficient staffing and technical knowledge on violence against women and girls that extends across the organisation. 106. In order to deliver on these goals, the UK Government must ensu re that it has the wider pre-requisites in plac e to make ending violence against women and gir ls a reality. In part, this means making adjus tments to DFID's own resourcin g, so that the Department's organisation and structure is appropriately ma tched to the job in hand. It is also about ensuring that cross-depart mental working is as ef ficient as possible so that initiat ives can be sustained in the long-term. A dditionally, in order to be a cred ible force for change around the world, the UK must ensure that its own \"house is in order\" by tackling practices such as FGM within its own shores. Violence against women and girls is present in all societies around the world, inclu ding our own. We cannot hide this, jus t as other coun tries must not hide behind cultural an d traditional values t hat perpetuate gender in equalities. Only when we can agree that certain valu es like outl awing violence against women and girls are universal\u2014as already reco gnised in international law\u2014will real progress be secured.

We welcome DFID's Strategic Vision for Girls and Women, Theory of Change on Violence Against Women and Girls and rela ted programming guidance as a helpful framework for DFID's response to viole nce against women an d girls. We were pleased to see that the numb er of country programmes wi th violence against women and girls components has increased. We were particularly pleased to see women's issues become a strategic pr iority in Afghanistan, as we recommended in our report last year. However, more need s to be done to prioritise violence against women and girls at country level and to bring DFID's programmes in line with the Theory of Change, so that the best prac tice it highlights is properly implem ented. DFID states that 20 countries now have a violence ag ainst women and girls component, but actual work on the ground seems thin in a number of co untry programmes, including Somalia, which has a poor record on women's rights. For countries with high prevalence of violence against women and girls such as DRC, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Sudan and Somalia, DFID should list tackli ng violence against wom en and girls as a strategic priority. (Paragraph 13) 2. Furthermore, whilst DFID is gradually increasing the nu mber of violence against women and girls programmes focusing on social norm change , there remains an imbalance towards programmes focusing on security and justi ce. Addressing the attitudes and behaviours that sustain vi olence against women and girls is of paramount importance. We recommend that DFID significantly increase its emphasis on changing the social norms th at drive violence agai nst women and girls. In order to do this, the Department shou ld undertake an assessment of both the implementation and impact of the Theory of Change, to see where the gaps lie. This process will also help identif y the right strategy for addr essing social norms, which will vary from country to co untry. DFID must also e nsure it can monitor these changes. We recommen d that it put in place systems to enable accurate tracking of the volume and nature of programming on gender equality an d violence against women and girls. (Paragraph 14) Working across sectors to address violence against women and girls 3. We were pleased to see that th e need for multi-sector appr oaches to violence against women and girls is one of the guiding principles of DF ID's Theory of Change. However, we recommend that DFID do more to ensure that sectoral programmes (other than security and justice progra mmes) address violence against women and girls. Health, education and humanitarian response are briefly mentioned in the Theory of Change, but more detailed an alysis and guidance is required on how programmes in these sectors can best a ddress violence against women and girls and how inter-sectoral responses will be implemented. This expertise exis ts, as the excellent evidence we rece ived attests, and must be used. (Paragraph 18) 52 Violence Against Women and Girls 4. The water and sanitation sect or is omitted entirely from both the Theory of Change and the accompanying guidance notes. This is a major omission, given data that demonstrates the significant risks of violence women face when walking to collect water or use sanitary facilit ies. We recommend that DF ID review the Theory of Change and issue specific guidance on how programmes ac ross key sectors- including health, education and water an d sanitation-can an d should address violence against women and girls. (Paragraph 19) Supporting women's organisations 5. We are pleased that DFID acknowledges the important role played by women's organisations at local, national and interna tional levels to bring about changes in social norms, institutions and policies to prevent and re spond to violence against women and girls. However, many women's organisa tions\u2014especially small community-based orga nisations\u2014often struggle to get adequate funding. We recommend that DFID review its funding channels and seek to increase funding to women's organisations to work on violence against women and gir ls at community, national and international levels. This shou ld include both core and programme funding and ensure continui ty and stability of funding over time. We recommend DFID explore funding specific women's funds for this purpose. We also recommend that DFID look at the way that it uses women's knowledge and expertise in-country to comment on and 'screen' DFID's gender policies. We understa nd that DFID uses formal gender advisory panels in some coun tries. We recommend that such formal gender panels are esta blished in more countries. We also recommend that informal local panels are establ ished so that local women can be involved in developing policy priorities, and to ensure that grassroots or ganisations secure the funding they need. (Paragraph 23) Civil society organisations in Ethiopia 6. We were concerned about the impact of Ethiopia's Proclamatio n on Charities and Societies law on civil society or ganisations in the country, and particularly on their ability to work on gend er-based violence (GBV). We commend DFID's decision in 2012 to commission a study to examine the impact of the proclamation on GBV- related services. We also co mmend the DFID Parl iamentary Under Secretary of State Lynne Featherstone MP for raising the i ssue with Prime Minister Hailemariam. We hope that the Ethiopian Government will review the human righ ts implications of the law, and urge it to exempt DFID from the 2009 law on charities and societies, and, indeed to ensure that certain types of work on gender\u2014including violence against women and girls\u2014can also be exempted. (Paragraph 27) Violence Against Women and Girls 53 Using the evidence base to inform policy and programming 7. We welcome DFID's new Research and I nnovation Fund for violence against women and girls anno unced in November 20 12. Unfortunately it looks unlikely that the research components wi ll be activated until 2014. Whilst we understand the reasons for not rushing the te ndering process, DFID needs to be mindful of getting the research fund up and run ning quickly. This is also true for programmes to address violence against women and girls more wide ly. DFID must have the milestones in place to en sure new programmes are intr oduced with a reasonable timeframe. (Paragraph 33) 8. However, there is a balance to be struck. Given the relati vely limited evidence about 'what works' to prevent violence against women and girls in different contexts, it is important that the Departm ent does not rush into large-scale violence against women and girls programming with unreal istic expectations about timeframes and results. Research in to violence against women and gi rls, as well as programming, needs to have realistic timeframes, in reco gnition of the time needed to bring about and measure complex social change. We recommend that DFID take a lead internationally by investing in longer -term, flexible and phased programming involving piloting, integrat ed research and analysis, and gradual scale-up of programmes and evaluation. Programmes to tackle violence agai nst women and girls should have a minimum 5-year timefram e and realistic re sults frameworks (including using inte rim and process indicators) in recognitio n that follow-up phases are likely to be needed and long-term i mpacts may only be realised after 10-plus years. (Paragraph 34) Female Genital Mutilation 9. We welcome DFID's a nnouncement of \u00a335 million fo r programming to \"end female genital mutilation in one generation\". If th is aspiration is to be met, the \u00a335 million funding must see rapid\u2014but careful\u2014investment. DFID's Business Case says that the NGO Tostan's approach on village empowerment, pioneered in Senegal, has probably shown the best results on the grou nd. Yet we have been told that it is too early to be sure that this approach is the most effective way to reduce FGM. We remind DFID of our earlier recommen dation to adopt a phased and flexible approach to programming, and to build the evide nce base as it work s, rather than to rush into large-scale programming to addr ess violence against women and girls based on a single model where the evidence on alternative models of intervention is incomplete. (Paragraph 40) 10. We were shocked to discover that there are estimated to be 20,000 girls at risk of female genital mutilation wi thin the UK. Whilst it is beyond our remit to comment on domestic policy, we believe that\u2014as it stands\u2014the UK's cred ibility in calling to end the practice overseas is undermined by the failure to tackle the problem at home. Witnesses recommended that the UK must put aside polit ical correctness and adopt a far more robust, cross-agen cy approach, where the police proactively track girls at risk of female genital mutila tion and step in to preven t parents having the procedure performed on their daughte r(s). We commend these reco mmendations and urge the Government to act upon them. We were app alled to discover that, despite 148 54 Violence Against Women and Girls referrals of femal e genital mutilation ca ses in the past four years, police and social services do not place at-risk girls on the Child Protection Regi ster. This must change. (Paragraph 45) 11. There is far greater scope for joint workin g across Government on tackling female genital mutilation overseas and in the UK, including through engagement with diaspora groups in the UK. We recommend publication of an up-to- date, binding document that requires all service providers\u2014Dep artments of Health and Education, DFID, the FCO, Home Off ice, Government Equalities Office, the Metropolitan Police Service, Ministry of Justice, and the Crown Pr osecution Service\u2014to play their part. We draw these recomm endations to the attention of the relevant select committees. (Paragraph 46) Early marriage 12. We were impressed with DFID's Finote Hi wot programme, which is working to end child marriage in the Amhara region of Ethiopia. It is supporting vital community- level work that is addres sing social norms and helpin g girls, boys and their communities understand the implications of early marri age, including the serious consequences for maternal he alth and girls' schooling. We ask DFID to consider where it could roll out similar programmes, and to report back on this in its response to this report. We also urge the UK Govern ment to make a poli tical commitment to ending child marriage internationally, as it has done with female genital mutilation. The two practices are linked, and\u2014as wi th female genital mutilation\u2014political leadership will be crucial to endi ng the practice. (Paragraph 51) Partner Violence 13. We were pleased to see t hat DFID has recently commi ssioned a revie w of evidence on partner violence, given that domestic violence is the most widespread form of violence against women and girls suffered by women and girls wo rldwide. It is important that DFID's programmes seek to tackle domestic viol ence, and that they are targeted at household level, given that social norm s and behaviours are largely formed here. The review also indicates that DFID should seek better to integrate violence with its work with children and soci al protection programmes. In its response to this report, DF ID shou ld r eport back on its plans for programming in this area in follow-up to the review. (Paragraph 55) Violence against women and girl s in humanitarian contexts 14. We welcome the Secretary of State for Inter national Development's Call to Action to address violence agai nst women and girls in humanitarian situations, and her decision to hold a summit in Autumn 2013. There is emerging evidence that tolerance of violence against women an d girls makes countries more prone to conflict. This makes tackling the acceptance of violence against women and girls all the more important. We repeat our earlier recommendation that DFID significantly increase its focus on social norms. Further, whilst the focus on sexual violence in conflict is important, it must also be re cognised that women an d girls also suffer Violence Against Women and Girls 55 from many other forms of violence in conflict and humanitarian settings\u2014including higher rates of intimate partner violence, child abus e, and child marriage. DFID should ensure that any ne w programming resulting from its Call to Action is sufficiently broad to in clude the full range of abuses th at women and girls experience in crisis settings and that it addresses preven tion in addition to response, by tackling the root causes of violence\u2014including underlying gender inequalities and discriminatory social norms. (Paragraph 63) 15. Levels of violence against women and girls, especia lly sexual violence , are particularly high during humanitarian emergencies. Yet the ev idence shows that\u2014despite international guidelines\u2014vital preventat ive and emergency responses to violence against women and girls are not accorded enou gh priority by dono rs at the onset of humanitarian crises. DFID must make tack ling violence agains t women and girls a central part of its human itarian programming, highligh ting the importance of focusing on violence against women and girls in the immediate onset of an emergency, and advocating th e delivery of lifesaving ser vices (such as sexual and reproductive healthcare) to su rvivors of violence as well as preventati ve measures such as safely situated water and sanitation facilities, firewood patrols, distributing stoves and the creation of safe spaces. (P aragraph 69) 16. DFID must also get tough with multilateral aid agencies which, we hear, continue to ignore basic measures for safeguardin g women in refuge e camps and other displacement sites. DFID must send a clear message to the major relief agencies that its funding of them is cont ingent on violence against wo men and girls being pushed to the top of the list of emergency measur es in crisis respon se. DFID should also include gender and violence against women and girls as key strategic priorities for the reform processes of UN humanitarian and relief agencies. We recommend that accountability to gender-based violence guidelines should be key criteria for DFID when channelling and disbur sing humanitarian funds, in cluding via p ooled funds. We recommend that DFID in clude violence against wome n and girls in its next multilateral aid revie w. (Paragraph 70) The Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative 17. We welcome the Foreign Secr etary's Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative. As the Initiative progresses from its initial inception phase, we recommend a broadening in scope to include: first, mo re emphasis on prevention (rather than response); secondly, a greater focus on survivor support serv ices in addition to work on formal investigations and prosecut ions; and finally, ensuring a link to wider work on different forms of violence against women and girls, addressing root causes of violence. We recommend that, in the Governm ent's Response to this report, it sets out how it might broaden the Initiative in the future to include these points. (Paragraph 75) 18. Access to justice is vital fo r women and girls suffering vio lence, including access to legal advice. We credit DFID for seeking to provide acce ss to justice for 10 million women by 2015. The PSVI has concentrated on prosecutio ns, but in addition it is important to talk about ways of facilitating women's access to justice. We urge the UK Government to ensure that the PSVI supports women to access justice as well as 56 Violence Against Women and Girls increasing prosecut ions. We look forw ard to the forthcom ing publication of DFID's Theory of Change on using security and justice programming to tackle violence against women and girls, and recomm end this document sp ells out in detail DFID's approach to this cru cial workstream. (Paragraph 76) 19. It is imperative that the UK Governmen t stands by its co mmitment to sustain momentum on the PSVI beyo nd the 2013 G8 Presidency . However, to be taken forward effectively, the Initiative must include a clearer articulation of DFID's role so that the Department's expertise is fully utilised. The FCO, whilst providing admirable leadership, does not have the mandate or knowledge to undertake programming to address violence against wom en and girls and de livery of women's services on the ground\u2014it is DFID that po ssesses this expertise. We anticipate that the DFID Secretary of State' s recent 'Call to Action' and her planned autumn summit on violence against women and girls in hu manitarian setting s will provide opportunities for embedding the PSVI within DFID's wo rk. We recommend that, in its response, the Government spell out spec ific details of DFID's future involvement in the PSVI, incl uding details of budgets and staffing. (Paragraph 78) Peacekeepers 20. We recommend that the UK Government continue to lobby at the UN for peacekeepers to be properly trained in preventing and re sponding to violence against women and girls, an d for any peacekeepers that commit abuses to be held to account. Further, we believe that the UK should also strengthen the training on violence against women and girls it provides its ow n troops, and to the peacekeeping forces that the MOD helps train. In the reply to this report, the Go vernment should state what steps the Secretary of St ate for Defence is taking to de liver effective training in respect of violence against wo men and girls. (Paragraph 79) Abortions for women raped in conflict 21. Certain donor agencies continue to restrict the use of their funds for the purposes of abortions for women raped during conflict. DFID has stated that the lifesaving care promised under the Geneva Conventions may sometimes include the provision of abortions to women raped in conflict if deemed medicall y necessary. However, this position has yet to be incorporated into the relevant DFID po licies. We recommend that DFID issue a clear policy statement spelling out the extent an d limits of its support for abortion for women raped in war. We also recommend that DFID engage in serious dia logue with donors that restri ct the use of their funds for abortion\u2014notably the US Government \u2014to ensure that women raped in humanitarian conflict settings can access the services they need, including abortion. DFID should work with its counterparts in the US, and with agencies affected by the US ban, such as the ICRC , to ensure that women raped in humanitarian conflict settings can acce ss the services they n eed, including aborti on. (Paragraph 82) Violence Against Women and Girls 57 The UK's role in tackling violence against women and girls through the UN system 22. We support DFID's continue d core funding of UN Wome n, which is an important way of ensuring predictability and continuity at the country level, especially with regard to the regular fu nding it enables UN Wo men to give to women's organisations. We agree with UN Women's suggestion that DFID should establish a longer-term, closer collabor ation on violence against women and girls with the agency, including the development of a joint violence against women and girls strategy. This would he lp DFID to capitalise on the technical expertise and country- level experience on violence against women and girls within UN Women, at a time when its own ability to employ extra staff is limited. (Paragraph 87) The Commission on the Status of Women and the Post-2015 Framework 23. We are pleased that DFID, together with the Government Equalities Office and the FCO, played an active role in securing what was generally co nsidered a positive outcome to the UN Commission on the Status of Women earlier this year (CSW 57). We urge the UK Government to now focus on following up the event. Key priorities should be to support implemen tation of conclusions, partic ular at countr y level, and to engage in early prepara tory work for CSW 58 in 2014 , which will focus on the post-2015 frame work to replace the MDGs. Whilst we have not had time to carry out a detailed analysis of the report of the High Level Panel (HLP) on Post-2015, we were very pleased to note that its \"illustrative goal framework\" inclu des a stand-alone gender goal. We very much welcome the inclusion of the targets to end violence against women and prevent chi ld marriage. We were also pleased to see that the HLP heeded our calls for gender equa lity to be integrat ed across all of th e goals. We urge the UK Prime Minister and Secretary of St ate for International Development to push for these \"illustra tive goals and targets\" to be retained in the final post-2015 framework at all cost s. (Paragraph 93) Strengthening DFID's role to deli ver on violence against women and girls 24. We welcome the UK Government's establi shment of the role of Ministerial Champion for Tackling Viole nce Against Women and Girls Overseas, the first of its kind internationally. The ro le offers the chan ce to improve policy coherence across departments\u2014especially DF ID, the FCO and the MOD\u2014and to reinforce the UK's international strategy on vio lence against women and girls. However, in order to do this the role must be proper ly resourced. We recommend th e creation of a small unit, adequately staffed, and the introduction of an annual Parliame ntary reporting cycle, that together will formalis e the role and enhance its st rength. (Paragraph 97) 25. We believe that, in order to sustain its impressive in ternational leadership on violence against women and girls, DFID mu st address its staf fing and knowledge base. DFID should keep the both the size , and the location of its violence against women and girls team, under review to ensure that it s resources are appropriately matched to the increasing focus on viole nce against women and girls within the Department. DFID should co nsider re-activat ing its Gender Equality Action Plan\u2014 dropped in 2010\u2014as a useful tool for ensuri ng that staff across the organisation in 58 Violence Against Women and Girls Headquarters and country offi ces have strong knowledge and capacities to work on gender and issues connected with violence agains t women and girls. (Paragraph 102) 26. We welcome DFID's efforts to expand its technical ca pacity on violence against women and girls via the new he lpdesk, but this is no substitute for strengthening the in-house capacity of staff. It is especia lly important to increase the capacity of country programme staff, wh o are responsible for the ac tual implementation of programmes to address violence against wom en and girls. Trai ning and guidance must go beyond box-ticking to be a real priority for all DFID staff. We agree with witnesses that DFID should consider a minimum trai ning on violence against women and girls before staff can be deployed overseas.

Q1 Chair: Good morning, and welcome to our Committee. As you may appreciate, this is the rst formal evidence session we are holding in our inquiry into violence against women and girls, and thank you very much for coming in. I wonder for the record, rst of all, if you would just like to introduce yourselves? Annmarie Mavenjina: Good morning. I am Annmarie Mavenjina. I work with ActionAid Tanzania as a Women's Rights Adviser. Bernice Sam: My name is Bernice Sam. I work as the Executive Director of Women in Law and Development in Africa. I am based in Ghana. Q2 Chair: As I say, thank you both very much. The rst thing we have to say is that of course violence against women happens in all societies, but obviously it is perhaps more prevalent and more extreme in some circumstances than others. We are trying to look at the incidence, the causes and, much more to the point, remedies to try to change the situation. First of all, in the context of your own countries, Ghana and Tanzania, what is the kind of violence that is most widespread against women? Also\u2014and perhaps it sounds like an obvious question, but maybe it is not\u2014 who are the main perpetrators? Who is doing the violence? Annmarie Mavenjina: The main types of violence that are prevalent in Tanzania are related to domestic violence, and then rape and female genital mutilation. For the rape cases, the perpetrators are men\u2014some men who are not gender-sensitive\u2014and for female genital mutilation it is women, who have traditionally performed the act of FGM. For domestic violence, sometimes it is intimate partners, sometimes it is their husbands, and sometimes boyfriends. Bernice Sam: Thank you for having me here. With respect to Ghana, I want to read a few headlines from some of our newspapers, to give you an idea of the forms of violence we have in the country. The rst one says, \"Woman's eye removed over jealousy,\" and it is jealousy by a male partner. \"Girl, 6, butchered by her parents.\" \"Woman, 32, remanded for threatening to kill husband,\" and here I would want to question why she wanted to kill the husband, but of course she has been remanded in prison custody, so they want toJeremy Lefroy Mr Michael McCann Fiona O'Donnell Chris White interrogate her as well. The next one I have is, \"Man nabbed for killing, burying wife.\" These give an indication of the kinds of violence we have in the country. Similar to Tanzania, we have intimate-partner violence: that could be physical violence or psychological violence. Sexual violence is quite prevalent. We are seeing many cases of delement of children, boys and girls, below 16 years. We are seeing a lot of rape, adult rape of course. We are seeing a lot of sexual harassment within the workplace and in educational institutions. There is also economic violence, where women's earnings are taken away from them by their male partners, where women are prevented from working, and where money for the sustenance of the family is not forthcoming from the breadwinner or breadwinners. We are also seeing quite a number of traditional practices against women. I will give you two quick examples. Recently in a town called Dove, girls who are menstruating and women who are pregnant or having babies have been banned from doing that in that village. They must go outside the village to complete their biological menstrual cycle or to have babies. In another community, when a chief passed away, it took nine years for the three widows to go through the customary rituals that would allow them to become free\u2014to be able to go to their farm. They were conned to their homes for nine years. These examples just tell you the magnitude and the kinds of violence we have in the country. Q3 Chair: In your view has the situation got worse in recent times, or better, or has it stayed the same? You are obviously doing something about it, but is anybody doing something about it, and is it having any effect? Are there any things that have been positive in terms of impact? Bernice Sam: Let me quickly refer to research that was done in 1998 by a civil society organisation, which looked at the prevalence or incidence and the kinds of violence we have. That research found that one in three women had been physically abused, one in ve women had undergone psychological violence, and one in ve women had experienced forced sex inEv 2 International Development Committee: Evidence 12 February 2013 Bernice Sam and Annmarie Mavenjina her life. Since that research a lot of advocacy has gone on by civil society organisations and by Government agencies, and many things have happened. One of the critical things that were done by the Government was the institution of what then was the Women and Juvenile Unit of the Ghana Police Service. It was a unit that did a lot of education on violence, and many people reported violence to that unit. Of course a few years down the line, men and boys began complaining that it could not be a Women and Juvenile Unit, because men were also being violated, so the name was changed to the Domestic Violence and Victim Support Unit, to take care of women, men, boys and girls. That has been done. We have a law, a Domestic Violence Act, in place. We have criminal offences on some of the customary practices, such as those I described. Then we have the witches. When you are older, you are labelled as a witch in some parts of the country, and you are banished from your community, so you go and live in a camp, or when your husband passes away you undergo very cruel widowhood rites. All these are criminal offences. Female genital mutilation has been banned as well; it is a criminal offence. A lot is happening, but there is also a lot that has to happen, because violence against women and girls is a development issue. It is not something we can put in a box. We cannot say, \"Oh, it is one of those things.\" It goes to the core of all the development efforts by the Government, by development partners, by DFID, to get poverty out of the way. If women cannot work because they are abused, if women cannot take care of their children because their partners are not providing for them, then the efforts we put into infrastructural development and institutional support will not give us the results we want. I want us to look at violence against women as a development issue. The magnitude, the incidence and the impact affect all the development aid we have, unless we take concrete measures to address the root causes of violence against women and children. Q4 Chair: What about Tanzania? What is the situation there? Annmarie Mavenjina: Recently there was research undertaken in December, by the leading civil society organisations working in the area of women's rights. On the prevalence of female genital mutilation, the statistics reflected that one in seven women had undergone female genital mutilation, and then we also have laws that are conflicting. Before 1998 we did not have specic legislation dealing with offences related to violence against women. Then in 1998, as a result of advocacy efforts by civil society organisations, the Sexual Offences Special Provisions Act was enacted and was incorporated in the penal code. However, there is a gap in the law: female genital mutilation is not allowed, all acts relating to sexual violence are not allowed, but for that particular law it prohibits female genital mutilation below the age of 18. What happens in practice, for those who are aware of that law in the rural areas, is that they do female genital mutilation for women who are above 18, or for very tiny babies, because they know nobody will check on those babies when they go to antenatalclinics or for health check-ups. Sometimes when you get married in the rural setting and you have not undergone FGM, your in-laws or relatives can arrange for the other women who are traditionalists to perform that act on you. One of the organisations we work with strategically as ActionAid conducted research in one of the rural areas, Tarime, where FGM is very prevalent, and between November and December, more than 500 girls were just walking past the police station, going for that event where they would have female genital mutilation. The police ofcers did not take any effort to prevent them, and when they were asked why they were not intervening, they said that with the degree of violence in that community, the community would end up overpowering the police. We have issues relating to enforcing laws; there are some laws in place, but they are not being adequately enforced. Some of the cases of violence against women are not reported, because they are two different levels. You may try as an organisation to bring about behaviour change in the community, then the number of people reporting increases slightly, but the courts are not functioning and are not giving priority to issues related to violence against women. For a murder case, a State Attorney will be allocated to support whoever has been accused of performing the act of murder, but for issues relating to rape, FGM and all that, it is not your right to get a State Attorney. You have to opt for legal aid services, and legal aid services are not available all over the country. There are about eight key organisations that provide legal aid. There are also paralegals. Sometimes the State Attorneys will provide support in cases related to violence against women, but it is not really a legal requirement. The prevalence of violence against women is still high in Tanzania. Q5 Hugh Bayley: Can I just come back? I am sorry; I did not follow that last point. You said in murder cases, the person who is accused has a state lawyer? Annmarie Mavenjina: Yes. Hugh Bayley: But in rape or FGM cases\u2014can you explain again? You said they have to apply for legal aid. Who applies, the victim? Annmarie Mavenjina: Yes. Hugh Bayley: Or is it the person accused of committing the violence? Annmarie Mavenjina: As an advocate\u2014I am an advocate\u2014the Law Society or the Government can assign you a brief to go in and defend a murder case, because according to the criminal laws that we have, if someone has been accused of murder, they are entitled to get a State Attorney to defend their case. However, not much priority is given to women who have undergone violence, because there is no provision in the law that entitles you to have someone go in and defend you. The options you would have are to resort to legal aid services from organisations that provide legal aid, or go to the police station to report the case, but with the system we have in place, the police may not investigate; the culprits may decide to pay some money and then, due to corruption, your case might not proceed.International Development Committee: Evidence Ev 3 12 February 2013 Bernice Sam and Annmarie Mavenjina Q6 Hugh Bayley: Can I just ask one further question? Thank you very much. You are making a strong political point: a murderer gets legal aid, but a victim of FGM or domestic violence does not. You said in this area of high prevalence the police were afraid to arrest because the community would attack the police station or take reprisals. In other parts of the country, are there many cases brought against perpetrators of domestic violence or FGM? How many cases are brought per year in Dar, should we say? Has the fact that people are taken to court and convicted of these reduced the incidence of violence? Annmarie Mavenjina: I did research in 2011. We were working with different organisations, so I went to conduct research in the main district court in town, checking on the court registries to see the prevalence of violence against women and violence against children. Out of every 10 cases, you would get a number of cases related to abuse, but if you check on the status of the case, it would be either dismissed, or the survivors or victims had not turned up to follow up that case further. The law states that once someone commits an offence of rape they will go in for 30 years. The victim is supposed to be compensated, but court cases take a very long time. What happens is that the perpetrators decide to pay the victim's family money so that they do not proceed with the case any further. Then there is the whole process. You have to ll in police form number 11, you have to go to the hospital, you have to go to the court and different places, and they tell you you should not wash yourself once you are raped. Some women feel they cannot go through that. You have faced enough. You have been raped, then you go to the police station with all those clothes, not changing or anything, then from the police station to the hospital, and after that is when you go to court. Then the perpetrators, when they pay some money in the police station, are let off, and then you have to follow them up in court. It is only in Zanzibar, where there is the one-stop centre, that you get the police, health personnel, the counsellor, plus the lawyers. That is something that is working out gradually in Zanzibar, but on the Tanzanian mainland we do not have the one-stop centre in place. You have to go to the different service providers, and once you get all that evidence, that is when you go to court. If the police form number three is not lled in well, forget about your case; you will end up losing it. Then once the judge mentions the case and then says, \"Come back tomorrow or the other day,\" most of the women end up giving up, so that discourages them from reporting it. That is why, if you are dealing with violence against women, you have to deal with it at different levels: do the behavioural change at community level, deal with the institutional reforms like the courts plus the policymakers, and at the same time work with other organisations, whether it is the health personnel or the police. Now there is the Tanzania Female Police Network. Before, the police never used to offer user-friendly services, but after the Police Network was set up, 417 Gender Desks were put into police stations. A Gender Desk is like a specic room for police personnel who have been trained to be able tosupport someone who has undergone violence. There are also men who undergo violence, but it is mainly prevalent for women. The initiatives that civil society organisations and the police are taking on together are helping to reduce the prevalence rate. Q7 Jeremy Lefroy: In Western Tanzania, particularly in the Mwanza area, there was a lot of violence against older women suspected of being witches. Annmarie Mavenjina: Yes. Jeremy Lefroy: I remember it particularly from the 1980s and 1990s. Is that still prevalent? What is the extent and what is the Government doing about it? Annmarie Mavenjina: For the elderly women, if you had red eyes and all that because you are using rewood to cook and you have grown old, most people are then thinking, \"Oh, you are now a witch. You are the one who is bringing all this bad luck and omens to the people in your community.\" That still is going on, but, with interventions from civil society organisations and Government also taking the initiative, it is reducing, but it is something that happens sometimes. What distracted people's attention from that was seeing the issue of albinism come about, because they were thinking more about albinos than thinking of the elderly, but they also need their rights to be protected. There is also the constitutional review process that is going on now, so that is one of the areas where civil society organisations have been pushing\u2014to ensure that protection of the rights of the elderly, vulnerable women and children are taken care of also. Q8 Jeremy Lefroy: Just to follow up what you mentioned about albinism, that is a real issue, is it not, at the moment? Obviously we are talking particularly about women and girls here, but albinism is something where albinos are killed, particularly for body parts, is it not? Annmarie Mavenjina: During the time of the elections in 2010, most politicians, and sometimes others, believed in witchcraft and all that. Then there are also business people who feel that, if they take the body parts of the albinos, they will grow rich and all that if they export it to their neighbouring countries, or they use it in their shing communities. Those are certain beliefs relating to witchcraft; people thought that if they were able to get the body parts of the albinos, they would be able to make it in life and prosper. It is not really something true, but it is what happened in Tanzania, and that tarnished the image of Tanzania within the East African community. Before it was considered a peaceful country, but after that most people felt it was not good. But now, regarding the albinos in Mwanza, some of the children have been put in schools where they can be taken care of, because there was a lot of pressure put on the Government over that particular incident. Q9 Mr McCann: Good morning, ladies. Bernice Sam: Good morning. Annmarie Mavenjina: Good morning. Mr McCann: I am afraid my question is about Tanzania as well, so I think it will be AnnmarieEv 4 International Development Committee: Evidence 12 February 2013 Bernice Sam and Annmarie Mavenjina answering it. Our gures show that Tanzania has one of the highest domestic violence rates in the world; around 70% of women experience violence in their lifetime. What would you say are the contributory factors that make that gure so high? Annmarie Mavenjina: We did research as ActionAid last year, and we have also been checking on the research of other organisations. The main contributory factor there is patriarchism, and then some of the culture. Some of the men feel that if you do not beat your wife, you have not shown her how much you love her. That is in areas like Tarime. It also happens that you may have men who are living in urban areas but have grown up in a rural setting, so they end up having that culture. One night one of my neighbours was beating his wife, and then I went to check. It was around 11 or 12. I said to myself, \"I cannot say I am doing women's rights work, then hear something of the sort happening in the neighbour's house and just cover myself and sleep.\" I thought, \"I will go and knock on their house.\" I went and asked him, \"What is going on here?\" and he told me he had come back late at night and he had knocked on the door and she had taken a long time to open, so he felt he ought to beat her up so that next time she will open very fast. Sometimes it depends on the cultural setup. Other times, other contributory factors include people committing acts of domestic violence and no action being taken against them. If you go and report it to the police station, and what used to happen in the past is that the police would tell you, \"Oh, no, this is your own family issue. Go back and sort it at home.\" But with the Gender Desks now, at least the police are taking some action. Another factor that contributes to that is that some of the women feel ashamed to go and report such incidents, so there are repeat cases, which keep on going on, which is why we are trying to have behavioural change also. For some of the men, others are just frustrated, so they feel that maybe if they beat you, they will put you in your place. Another factor that contributes to domestic violence is if you do not have specic legislation that says exactly what is supposed to be done in such incidents and clearly denes what amounts to domestic violence. If cases also are not fast-tracked, you may le a case in court and it takes too long, and the perpetrator is not convicted. That is one of the factors that contribute to persistent domestic violence. Q10 Pauline Latham: This is a question for both of you, not just about Tanzania. What measures, if any, would you say would help address domestic violence in your countries? Practical measures such as refuges for women can help. What other areas do you think could be improved? Bernice Sam: To address violence against women and girls, we would need measures at two levels. The rst is to look at the institutions that exist to protect women and girls who undergo violence. Here I am referring to the courts, the police, the social services, and of course we have that in the country. There is a law in place. The police have a special unit, as I mentioned, the Domestic Violence and Victim Support Unit. There is a domestic violence court, so we have several courts that address just that.Q11 Pauline Latham: Are the units run by women? Or are they run by men? Bernice Sam: No, these are both men and women who are trained, but it is an initiative within the police service to have these units. Presently we have 100 of these units across the country, which has increased the reporting of violence against women and girls, and of course against men and boys as well. We need a lot more courts, domestic violence courts, where judges are trained to understand the power play between men and women\u2014that violence is about the power inequalities between men and women. They need to understand that, because we have more male judges than female judges, and we do not want to assume that female judges, by the fact that they are women, will understand the gendered undertones of violence against women and girls. They need training. The police also require training to be able to do their work well: on the way they receive victims or survivors of violence; on where they will put them to sit; on where they will ask them questions; on prosecution\u2014all those things come into play. At the institutional level, we need that kind of support, and that support has to be co-ordinated. It should be such that we do not have them working in isolation\u2014the police work in isolation and the health sector works in isolation\u2014but we need a co-ordinated approach backed by policy and law that requires all the different actors to play a role. For example, if a woman walked into a police station and said, \"I have been abused by my partner,\" the police should be able to refer her to a psychologist, who should be able to refer her to a doctor, who should be able to refer her to a social service if she needs to go into a shelter, who should be able to refer her to a court. It should be co-ordinated in a way that allows us to provide holistic support to a survivor of violence. That is at the macro level, if we could say that. However, it is also important to look at an approach that goes down to the community, to prevent the violence from happening in the rst place. Here we are talking about addressing the social norms, where people see violence as an acceptable practice, and looking at having sanctions within communities to address violence. I will give an example. We have in my organisation what we call the Community Reconciliation Committees. These are people from the communities who are provided with alternative dispute resolution skills and taught the laws that protect women and children, and their roles in the communities are to continue the sensitisation, to work with traditional leaders, with women's groups, with men's groups, with youth groups, and where there are cases that they can take and settle, like non-maintenance of a child, it does not need to be taken to the police station. The woman is looking at, \"If my husband is incarcerated, who will help me to take care of the child?\" They can educate the man to understand his parental responsibilities. They also will be able to assist a survivor who wants to go to the police to follow a case through to the court. We are looking at a two-pronged holistic approach at the institutional level to support the state institutions, to protect women and also to address the discrimination that happens in the country.International Development Committee: Evidence Ev 5 12 February 2013 Bernice Sam and Annmarie Mavenjina I also wanted to relate this to other developmental issues, because where we have people who are unemployed, we get the symptoms: unemployment can lead to violence. Where we have a lot of alcohol or drug abuse it can lead to violence. Traditional practices and people's beliefs can also lead to violence. We need to be addressing all of these things. We cannot just look at one aspect of the problem and leave the other. Of course this year with the emphasis by the UN on prevention, soon there will be the Commission on the Status of Women happening in New York. The UN Secretary-General's statement is already out, and it emphasises prevention alongside providing support in terms of legislation, policies and nancial support to state institutions. We would need to look at both of these approaches: the prevention aspect, education, sensitisation, community mobilisation as well as a protection part, where we work with institutions to protect victims or survivors. Q12 Pauline Latham: Where do you see donors coming in to assist this? Bernice Sam: If I can just focus a bit on DFID, as I am in the UK, DFID's support in the area of violence against women and children, or women and girls, in Ghana has not been very big. In fact, I checked before coming how much money DFID has put into civil society organisations' work to address that, and the total amount they gave me was in the range of \u00a3373,000. That is not a very big amount of money, and that is going to ve civil society organisations only. DFID has also provided some support to the Government to undertake a survey on violence against women and children. It is a small amount\u2014I did not get the exact amount, but I know the research has not been completed. DFID's allocation is part of a pooled fund in Ghana. It is called the STAR-Ghana Fund, which has DFID, USAID, the EU and the Dutch all contributing to it. I would want to see a lot of DFID support to the country ofcers focusing on violence against woman and girls. It should look at the two approaches: rstly, support to state institutions, because the courts need support and we need more domestic violence courts. The police need support; I have the annual report of the Ghana Police Service, and they are crying for more vehicles. Sometimes they have survivors and they cannot help them. We have three small shelters in the country: where do they take children who are abused and need that facility immediately? There are issues there. Secondly, I want to see DFID support going into women's rights work: those who provide the services, as you mentioned\u2014the legal aid, the education, the community sensitisation. I would want to refer to funds like the MDG3 Fund of the Dutch Government, which provided money specically for gender equality, and huge amounts of money went to various groups across the world to do work on gender equality. I believe that with a lot of emphasis on violence against women and girls last year and this year by the international community, if DFID can get the country ofcers, as well as its policy, focusing onviolence against women and girls, that will go a long way. They should also ensure there is a monitoring system to get the country ofcers to report on how well they are supporting organisations and the Government, and to report on these to Committees such as yours, such that you can track the results that you are getting: the prevalence rates that are reducing and the reports that are going up, but those reports go with support for state institutions and more CSOs working to address the issue at community level. I think that is the way that DFID and the UK Government should go. Q13 Hugh Bayley: In this country, the women who are most at risk of violence are low-income, low-status women. Some professional women and women with their own independent means are, of course, victims of violence, but they are less at risk, I suppose, because they are more aware of their rights, how to get protection, how to go to the police, and so on. From my experience, in developing countries the same is true. To what extent do you think this problem can be addressed by addressing the underlying power relations, and what should be done to address these problems\u2014these cause factors? Pauline Latham: Can I just challenge what you have just said? I am sorry to interrupt, but it is not the case that, if you are educated, it does not happen to you. That is totally untrue. Hugh Bayley: I did not say that. In fact, Pauline, if you had listened, I said there are cases, but there is a lower incidence and there is a higher incidence. Pauline Latham: It is still a lot of cases, and it does not mean to say that they get the help. Hugh Bayley: I agree with you on that; I do not disagree. Perhaps the rst question, then, is: do you agree that the more unequal the power relations between men and women, the greater the risk of violence? What can be done to strengthen women's hands in those relations? Annmarie Mavenjina: To some extent, when you have unequal power relations, it contributes to violence against women, but still, violence against women is something that happens to women from all walks of life, whether you are rich or poor, educated or not educated. The only difference is that for some women who are educated or higher class, they prefer not to go on talking about it, but to just seek legal help and follow all the procedures without reporting it in the media or telling everybody, but it happens all over. What could be done about it to reduce it? There are initiatives that have been undertaken in Tanzania, like having the one-stop centre that I talked about. It is a hospital facility, where you can go and get support from the police, get support from a legal aid provider and a counsellor, and other things can also be done. You have to deal with it at the community level, to try to change their behaviour, and also at an institutional level, to try to change how long a case takes in the judiciary. In Zanzibar, just last week, a user-friendly children's court was launched, with facilities where children can give their evidence in camera, without having to face so many others, but we did not have that before. If weEv 6 International Development Committee: Evidence 12 February 2013 Bernice Sam and Annmarie Mavenjina have maybe a court that is user-friendly for women, and then judges and judicial personnel who are also trained on why they have to fast-track such cases so that the woman is able to feel that her rights have been met, and so that she is able to get her compensation, that would discourage other potential perpetrators from getting involved in violence. It would also encourage other women to report, and gradually that would bring behavioural change in the community. It would also contribute to reducing the levels of poverty, because Government resources are used to intervene in this, and civil society organisations are also using donor money to intervene in this, so a lot of taxpayer's money is being taken in this area. Then also doing monitoring and evaluation: so many interventions are undertaken without having a baseline survey in place. The World Health Organisation has its own statistics on Tanzania and other countries; civil society organisations have their own statistics; the police have their own. But if a baseline survey is done to check on the whole prevalence rate and if money is put in to make interventions, it will be easy to measure progress when the midterm survey is done, and later on. Also, if monitoring and evaluation is strengthened, it is possible to track the progress and see the changes in the community. Other practical things that can be done that are cost-effective include Community Development Facilitators, whom ActionAid works with. Those are ordinary men and women within the community, who live in communities where people experience violence, and the doors of their homes are open anytime. Someone can go and knock and share their case, because violence happens at night, sometimes when someone comes back drunk and decides to abuse their wife or children. In incidents like that, the Community Development Facilitators come in handy: because they are closer to the community, it is possible for them to follow up with the victim, to support them in going to court, to support them in going to the police station. That is one of the ideas that can help. Something else that can be done is strengthening the police. In Tanzania, after the Female Police Network was set up, it opened up police stations to women, children and even men, because some of the police ofcers within the 417 Gender Desks have received training on how to handle people who have undergone gender-based violence, so when they offer services in a way that makes people feel comfortable to open up to them, it encourages people to report cases of violence. Q14 Hugh Bayley: Could I ask the same question of Bernice? Bernice Sam: Sure. Hugh Bayley: What can donors do to address the unequal power relations and the social norms that precipitate violence against women? Bernice Sam: Thank you very much for that. I can give the exact DFID contribution in Ghana. It is \u00a3373,260, in support to ve civil society organisations to do work around violence against women and children.Specically to the question that you asked, we can improve women and girls' social, economic and political empowerment. On social empowerment, to give an example with respect to the education of girls, we have had many projects in the country focusing on safe schools, to enable girls to remain in school, get a basic education, and go through high school. That can be looked at. It also means that girls need to know their human rights. Our experience is that as you get the girls to understand that you are a person of value, you are a dignied person, and you do not have to say yes or condone certain acts of violence, it enables the girls to negotiate sexual violence, to be able to say no, and to have a vision that they want to nish school and become important people in society. Addressing girls' education is very important, in an environment that enables them to thrive without fear that they could be sexually abused by their peers or by their teachers. It also means we have to look at economic empowerment of women, particularly for young women\u2014those who unfortunately are not able to continue beyond high school\u2014to be able to get vocational skills and to be able to earn an income for themselves, so that we do away with the dependency on male partners to be able to survive, as it were. When you depend on a male partner, you are more susceptible to accepting violence as a way of life because you do not have any income of your own, so girls' empowerment, women's empowerment, is very important. On women's empowerment, I want to make reference to the small and medium-scale enterprises that many women get into. Many women are in the informal sector, so it means getting access to small loans\u2014 micronance as we call it, or microcredit\u2014to be able to do some work. There is a lot of evidence and research that shows that, when a woman is economically empowered, she is able to address violence. She is able to say no, because she does not depend on the man for her money. She can better support and take care of her children, because she can contribute to or pay for the school fees of her children. She can give them better healthcare and all that. Women's economic empowerment is very important. Also women's political empowerment is very important; the more women we have in decision-making positions, the more we can look at the issue from a policy level\u2014from a sharing of views at the table\u2014to make decisions that address this problem in our countries. Of course it is a universal issue and not peculiar to Africa that within the legislature we have very few women. When you come to the local assemblies, again, there are few women. In ministerial positions there are few women. It is important to address women's participation in decision-making through measures such as afrmative action\u2014through getting our Government to work towards gender equality and putting in place measures that will get more women in positions of power and able to look at measures that can address violence against women and children. We also need to look at the symptomatic problems, because when people are unemployed, when there is alcohol or drug abuse, all those things have to beInternational Development Committee: Evidence Ev 7 12 February 2013 Bernice Sam and Annmarie Mavenjina addressed, and that means that we are looking at creating jobs for people. That means that we are looking at services that provide support for people who abuse alcohol or people who are going through depression, or are frustrated. They should have somewhere to go. I also want to underscore the point that emphasis is often put on helping the survivor victim, but not the perpetrator. We have said that men are the majority of the perpetrators, but whilst we are focusing on providing support, protecting and promoting the rights of the survivors, mainly the woman or the female, we forget that the perpetrator also needs help. In looking at a holistic approach to dealing with the problem, we need to make sure that we are not just incarcerating men who are abusing, but alongside that they are getting counselling and support. There are groups\u2014 the name escapes me\u2014where they can sit and listen to their own problems and they can learn from each other, and where there are counsellors to help them. That must happen. Q15 Fiona O'Donnell: You have answered a lot of the questions I was going to ask, which is very helpful. I wondered if I could ask something a little bit different. I am just wondering about the variations in prevalence in different parts of your countries in violence against women. Is there a difference between urban and rural, or is it all on a tribal and cultural basis? Annmarie Mavenjina: There is a difference, depending on the setting. There are some areas where female genital mutilation is practised, like in Tarime and Singida, which are different areas where they used to have that practice within their cultures and customs, but in a place like Zanzibar, they do not have female genital mutilation. We found there was just one case there from doing our research, but they told us that particular case was not someone who was originally from Zanzibar but someone from the Tanzanian mainland, and that was why they had that incident of female genital mutilation. It depends on the area. For domestic violence, however, that happens all over, whether urban or rural. The one related to early marriage happens in places like Zanzibar, where due to the Islamic religion they feel as long as you have reached puberty you can go ahead and get married. On the Tanzanian mainland, early marriage also happens, because in the Law of Marriage Act, at the age of 15 you can get married, according to the law. We have the Children's Act, which says the age of a child is below 18. The Law of Contract says if you are below 18 you do not have the capacity to contract, but still the Law of Marriage recognises marriage at the age of 15 and below, with the consent of your parents. Early marriage in such a context happens in the rural areas, especially if you link it up to education. Universal primary education is up to about age 12, 13 or 14, so if you are in primary school and in universal primary education, it is possible for you to delay marriage only up to primary level. Secondary education, however, is not universal as such: you have to pay for it, or cost-share with the Government, so that contributes also to early marriage. If we had universal secondary education also, girls would stayin school for a longer time and they would not get married at an early age. The legal framework, the culture and the geographical setting are things that contribute to the variations in prevalence. Q16 Fiona O'Donnell: Can I ask a bit more about DFID's funding in both of your countries? Bernice, you were saying there were only ve organisations. Can I ask whether either of your organisations is funded by DFID? Can you maybe tell us a bit about your experience of that? Do you get funding for long enough to have sustainability in your work, and how does DFID monitor and evaluate that? Bernice Sam: DFID funds us at two levels. One is our political participation work, which is a three-year programme. We have a lot of money from DFID Ghana and DFID UK, and of course the greatest news is that we have increased the number of women in the legislature from 19 to 30. That is wonderful; it is one fantastic result we got from all the advocacy and the work that we did. Of course at a local level we also increased women's representation in the local assembly, but a lot more happened there. With respect to the work relating to violence against women and children, we apply through STAR-Ghana, which is the pooled fund in the country. That process is quite simple, but highly competitive, because it is open to the entire country. The amount of money you get there is not so much. It is projectised. It is a one-year grant, limited to two districts out of 170 districts. Of course in one year you cannot get a lot of results; you just begin to see the immediate results, and not the intermediate or the ultimate results. In that respect the money that we got is quite small. It is projectised and does not enable you to recruit high-calibre staff. It does not enable you to do work at the community level with the men, boys, women and traditional leaders to begin to change some of the norms that perpetuate violence. In that respect it is quite small, but the political participation work was big; we have almost nished evaluating it. Indeed, the results there are awesome. Even from the implementers' point of view, we have better results because it is long-term funding. We had time for women to engage with policymakers, and we are getting to the point where they can themselves, without us, continue the engagement around political participation at different levels. The point is that, when there is long-term funding, it allows you to see results and to report on results, because ultimately we want value for money; we want projects to be efcient. We want people to know that we made a difference in the lives of women and children in that community. That will require long-term funding but also core funding, because projectised funding does not help many women's rights organisations to sustain our institutions, given that we complement the efforts of Government in addressing problems such as violence against women and girls. Where there is no core funding, we cannot continue to keep a roof above our heads. We cannot pay our administration costs, and we cannot retain staff, because they will just leave for the corporate sector, for instance. Those things also impact on the other social problems that we have outlined in thisEv 8 International Development Committee: Evidence 12 February 2013 Bernice Sam and Annmarie Mavenjina conversation this morning. We need to look at core funding and long-term funding for organisations to do good work. Q17 Fiona O'Donnell: Annmarie, do you know about the funded by DFID? Annmarie Mavenjina: Yes. DFID supports ActionAid, but in the area of land rights. Women's rights are also related in that area. Most of the funding from DFID is given under the Foundation for Civil Society. That is one of the organisations that most development partners put their money into, and then the Foundation for Civil Society receives applications from civil society organisations all over Tanzania. However, when you go through DFID's key priority areas, violence against women and women's rights does not come out as a clear-cut priority for Tanzania, because there is agriculture, climate change and all that. The money for DFID is channelled through the Foundation, and through that it is expected that the Foundation for Civil Society, through supporting access to justice programmes, will be able to cater for issues of women's rights. However, the amount of money that goes in through the Foundation for Civil Society is not from DFID only. It is from different development partners, and the highest amount an organisation can get for a strategic grant is about \u00a3150,000, and that is for three years. However, if you are to track exactly how much money from DFID has gone in for violence against women, you want results but you also have to see how much you have put in. You could check on the Scandinavian countries, and what Danida is doing now. They are supporting legal sector reform programmes, like supporting the Government's general budget, and supporting the Foundation for Civil Society budget. They have set up a separate fund, the Legal Sector Facility, which deals specically with issues related to the legal sector. The Government had this legal sector reform programme, where all development partners were contributing, but it was taking quite some time to deliver results. After 10 years, the impact of the money that has been invested there has been seen. What Danida has done now is create their own separate fund to provide support. Prior to offering support, or doing a call for proposals, they did their own independent baseline survey, checking on what the actual situation in Tanzania was, instead of just coming in and setting up funds and saying, \"Okay, we have this call for proposals.\" It is important that DFID does an independent baseline survey, so that by the time the CSOs bring in their proposals or the Government comes to request money for budget support, you have separate information you can use to gauge and say, \"Does this proposal tally with what they are asking for?\" Something may look so good on paper, but it may not be what is actually on the ground. If a baseline is done by DFID, instead of just giving all the money to the Foundation or just supporting the Government, it would be very easy to monitor and track value for money, to hold Government and the civil society organisations accountable. Then I thinkthe way civil society organisations are held accountable is not the same way that Government is held accountable. I did nance and accounting, though I am a lawyer by profession, but the way you have to meticulously go through the nancial reports and narrative reports is not the same way that DFID and different development partners hold Government accountable. If Governments are also held accountable in the same way as civil society organisations, I think we will see more value for money, and taxpayers would also know exactly where their money is going and see the results. Then, instead of having just two-year or four-year projects, it would be better to have long-term projects or programmes in the development sector. What is happening for our development partners is that they are given a two-year or three-year pilot-phase grant, to see how they are going to perform, and what exactly is happening, instead of just giving them money for three or four years and then when they do not get the numbers and all that, saying, \"No, in the project document you said you would reach out to 2,000 women. Now I do not see 2,000 women, I will not fund you anymore.\" It would be good if there was a pilot phase for programmes funded by DFID, and then later on have maybe a mid-term review, end-line survey, and instead of having programmes just running for ve years, like the DFID strategy, it would be good if, even after the ve years, something else was done so that within 10 years you can see tangible results within the community. Otherwise, if you say two years, three years or four years, you will just see numbers and results at output level, and how many people have done this. The actual change within the community may not be fully realised. Q18 Fiona O'Donnell: The target for eliminating female genital mutilation is a generation, so maybe the funding should reflect that. You have all this evaluation and monitoring, but when good practice is identied and something works, is that shared within civil society? Bernice Sam: Yes, we do share that, and we document good practices. I will give just two quick examples. We have a project that we did in 1999-2000, where we set up committees called Community Based Anti-Violence Teams, or COMBAT. That was a model that worked quite well, because it was a model where communities took charge of the situation and had sanctions for people who abused women and girls. The community leaders would sanction them, and if anybody hit their wife, they would come in and do the sanction themselves, even before the law came in in 2007. The second is the Community Reconciliation Committee I mentioned. That is another model. That committee sits, listens to complaints, receives complaints, and addresses those that they can address, because it is about family relations and they want to keep families together. For those that have to go to the police, they accompany the survivor to the police. These are models that we share, and they are reported in Government reports as well as civil society reportsInternational Development Committee: Evidence Ev 9 12 February 2013 Bernice Sam and Annmarie Mavenjina as well. There are several models that can be replicated. Q19 Richard Burden: On the same line, you have been very clear about how you would like to see DFID be more effective in terms of both the kinds of projects it supports and the nature of funding, with core funding and longer term funding, and about the way you share good practice. How good is DFID at receiving good practice and sharing good practice? Regarding the kinds of things you have been telling us, do you get the impression that DFID is always on the lookout for what works, and then takes that on board, or not? Bernice Sam: From my experience with the political project, which is a longer programme, we regularly briefed DFID Ghana on what we were doing. We shared the work we were doing with DFID. Sometimes I went in to brief teams that came in from the UK or from Ghana. We report on the programme through Womankind UK, and so I believe they are also able to share the good practices with DFID from their end\u2014from the UK level. In terms of DFID looking out for good practices, they have done it in the past but I think it can be done better, where it could be part of the contract that is signed with the grantee. It could mean setting out some guidelines on how we should collect good practices, because we could put good practices in a framework that is easily shared over the internet or put on the website, or wherever, and then we can also talk about them. Either a framework or guidelines on what we should be documenting as part of the contract or the project would then provide that evidence of what is working and how DFID can build upon the good practices. I also want to propose that it is important we have an end-of-evaluation conversation between the grantees and the donor, so that we can look at lessons. It is not just us doing an evaluation and presenting an evaluation report, because sometimes people do not get time to read a whole report. If you can have a conversation at the end of the project and look at what the lessons are, what did not work and what can be replicated, then it is an opportunity to have conversations and take something away. Of course, the reporting template that we have has a lesson-learning part, where we provide some lessons that can be looked at in future programming. Q20 Chris White: Good morning. I know you have referred to it briefly in a previous answer, but could you conrm the legal age of marriage in both your countries? Annmarie Mavenjina: In our country, for a girl, you can get married at the age of 15. If you are 14, or even below that, with the consent of your parents or the court, you can get married. Bernice Sam: The situation is different in Ghana. The age of being an adult is 18 years, which is in line with the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Our constitution also says the legal age for being an adult is 18 years, so it is 18 and above. In fact, the Children's Act says that, where a marriage involves those under 18 years, the parents of the girl or boy will be punished, so it is a criminal offence to have achild marry below 18 years. There has also been a lot of advocacy in the country to ensure forced marriages among certain ethnic groups are reported. I have some statistics of reports made of forced marriages, which are in the police data, and because there is an explosion of the media in the country, when something of the sort is going on you can get somebody calling a radio station, and the police going in immediately to rescue the girl and take the girl to the shelter. Sometimes they run to civil society organisations. I have received some girls who have said, \"Look, I am in school. My father wants to marry me off,\" and we call the parents and talk to them about the importance of the girl's education and the implications of an early marriage on the girl. I have done two cases personally where the parents said, \"No, we are not going to get that girl to marry, because we did not know the implications.\" To answer you, the legal age is 18 years, but we do get some child marriages happening. It is a criminal offence, and the police take action when they hear about this. Q21 Chris White: I suppose more specically in Tanzania, what would lead a girl to be married under 18, and what do you think are the problems that would bring? Annmarie Mavenjina: What would lead a girl to marry under the age of 18? Let me give you an example in Zanzibar. Because of Islam, their religion, they feel you are not supposed to have premarital sex. If a girl is caught having sex with a boy, they use a Swahili word that calls that a \"marriage on a mat\". If they catch you having sex with someone, immediately the ceremony will be concluded. Your parents, plus the other family, will say you decided to have premarital sex, and then you will be forced to marry that person. Sometimes, for violence against women, if someone has raped you or had sex with you, they feel now that they do not want to have you in their home anymore, so both families will sit and agree that you ought to get married to that person. They feel if you stay home and you are pregnant, you are bringing an extra mouth to feed, and it is somebody else's child, not for their family, so you should go off and get married. Then for education, if you have to pay for your secondary education and then it is not really free of charge as such, and you have not passed to go to secondary school, some parents feel it is better to marry off their daughter while they are still young and have not got pregnant, so that they are able to get some bride price\u2014either money, cows, or anything that they can get. It becomes an economic venture for the parents, while also a violation of the rights of the girl. Then there is the legal framework we have. You have laws that permit people to get married below the age of 18. The Children's Act was enacted just two or three years ago, where the age of a child was stipulated as below 18, but you have a Law of Marriage that recognises marriage for boys and girls below the age of 18. Those are some of the contributing factors.Ev 10 International Development Committee: Evidence 12 February 2013 Bernice Sam and Annmarie Mavenjina Q22 Chris White: My nal question: what interventions are you putting in place, or have been put in place, to start to push the age of marriage up? Annmarie Mavenjina: The interventions that are being put in place include a constitutional review process going on in Tanzania now. Most civil society organisations, including ActionAid, are trying to push that the constitution should stipulate clearly the age of marriage for a child, and then all other gender-discriminative laws, like the Law of Marriage Act, should be declared unconstitutional, especially provisions that promote that. Then at community level, there are the Community Development Facilitators, women and men within the community that ActionAid works with. We have been training them and sharing with them, rst having dialogue in a community, nding out what their perspective is on violence against women, and then showing them the effects of marrying off their daughters at such an early age. We also have, under our education programme in ActionAid, school clubs. Within this school club you let children open up and have dialogue, but at the same time you instruct them on what amounts to violence against children. Then we have collaborated with strategic stakeholders like the police and legal aid providers to see how to prevent early marriage. Those are some of the initiatives that have been taken. Q23 Jeremy Lefroy: Just very briefly, because you have both already touched on it, what efforts are you engaged in, or have you seen being made, to reduce the incidence of female genital mutilation in your countries, and elsewhere as well, that have been successful? Bernice Sam: In Ghana it is a criminal offence to undergo female genital mutilation. The offence is interesting. The person who does the cutting and the person who sends the child to be cut are both punished. The clause of the law captures everybody. There are also organisations in the country that make it their priority to continue to educate communities where this practice goes on that FGM is a criminal offence and should not happen. That is going on, but in other countries in West Africa, FGM is prevalent: in the Gambia, in Burkina Faso and Liberia all these things happen as well. I do not know what interventions they are making in those countries, but I can talk for Ghana and say that we have a law that prohibits it. It does not mean that it does not happen, because laws are good, but they are only good if people know and take the steps to report it when somebody flouts the law. There has to be continuous education to get more people to understand that it is wrong. There have been a lot of documentaries on TV showing the gory nature of FGM, which many people really cannot watch. These are ways by which people come to understand the health implications of FGM on women and girls. To again go back to the social norms, it is also addressing the fact that it is not right that a woman should undergo that to be able to get a husband to marry, so it requires sensitisation with community leaders, not just to know that it is a law but to getthem to understand that it is simply wrong and the health implications it has for women and girls. Annmarie Mavenjina: The initiatives that have been undertaken in Tanzania are related to having evidence-based research, like saying that one in seven women have undergone FGM and showing the health effects of that. Once you have the statistics and share them with the community and the policymakers, that is something we have seen working. Before 1998, as I mentioned before, we did not have such a law, but after advocating, at least now we have it within our laws that female genital mutilation is not allowed. We are also still pushing that now it should not just be age 18. That is one of the laws that ought to be amended to remove \"age 18\", so that female genital mutilation should not be allowed totally. I think advocacy initiatives can work; if it was not for advocacy work, we would not have had that law in the rst place. Another thing I have also seen working is media coverage. The media have been very proactive in covering issues of female genital mutilation, bringing it out into public. Before most of our media houses would just cover issues related to politics, business, but once you bring out in the media issues of female genital mutilation and violence against women, people are able to get more done and see how to work in that area. Another intervention I have seen working is engaging men strategically, because most women do that saying, \"I have to do FGM; who will marry me if I do not do it?\" Once you engage the men and identify male champions, and tell them, \"Look, that is your daughter; it is your sister. What if it were your relative, not just your wife? Would you permit it? Look at the health effects,\" using evidence-based research and having dialogue with them, I have seen that working within communities. Q24 Fabian Hamilton: Can I ask you how you think the post-2015 Development Goals Framework should take account of the need to address violence against women and girls? Bernice Sam: I will go rst. Because many countries fell behind in meeting the Goals, and also because gender was mainstreamed in almost all the Goals, we did not get the kinds of results we wanted, particularly for Goals Three and Five, maternal mortality and the one on education and political participation. I would propose that gender equality be made a specic goal moving forward, and to also focus on violence against women and children, so that we can keep our eye on it. We all agree that violence against women and girls is a development issue, and since the Development Framework is about seeing countries develop, we need to address some of the problems that push countries behind. There is no point talking about, \"We have X number of highways and we have built skyscrapers,\" when the people are suffering. We have to make it a categorical goal, and make it very clear that gender equality is a goal in itself. Violence against women and girls should be very key to achieving gender equality. Then we can monitor and put money into interventions that will address the problem.International Development Committee: Evidence Ev 11 12 February 2013 Bernice Sam and Annmarie Mavenjina Q25 Fabian Hamilton: So what you are saying is that development and gender equality are inextricable? Bernice Sam: Exactly. Annmarie Mavenjina: Personally I think it is very important to have something specic on violence against women, as in key performance indicators for different countries to report on. If you just have it broadly as gender equality without specically having indicators to measure progress, then you may mainstream gender issues and feel you have taken care of women's rights, but it can get lost in the whole process. I think it would be good if we had a specic standalone women's rights Goal, with indicators showing issues of violence against women. It would then be possible to measure progress and see how different countries are progressively working towards achieving that. It would also be important to hold our Governments accountable. Sometimes they take quite some time to report. Sometimes they feel, \"Oh, after all they have said, we will do progressive realisation,\" so they say, \"No. Since it is progressive realisation, we do not have money for this,\" but there is money to pay the Members of Parliament, there is money to cater for the army, and there is money to cater for security issues. What about violence against women? Examination of Witnesses Witnesses: Detective Chief Superintendent Keith Niven , Metropolitan Police Child Abuse Investigation Command, Detective Chief Inspector Iqbal Singh , Metropolitan Police Child Abuse Investigation Command, Efua Dorkenoo OBE , Advocacy Director, FGM Programme, Equality Now, and Nimco Ali , Daughters of Eve, gave evidence. Q26 Chair: Good morning, and thank you all very much for coming in to speak to us. Again, just formally for the record, perhaps you could introduce yourselves, perhaps starting with DCI Singh? DCI Iqbal Singh: A very good morning to you. My name is Iqbal Singh; I am a Detective Chief Inspector in the Child Abuse Investigation Command for the Metropolitan Police Service. DCS Keith Niven: Good morning. My name is Keith Niven. I am a Detective Chief Superintendent, and I head the Child Abuse Investigation Command at Scotland Yard. Efua Dorkenoo: Good morning. I am Efua Dorkenoo. I work with Equality Now, which is an international human rights organisation, and I am the technical lead on female genital mutilation. Nimco Ali: Good morning. My name is Nimco Ali and I am the co-founder of an organisation called Daughters of Eve, which works with young British women who have been affected by, or are at risk of, female genital mutilation. Q27 Chair: Thank you. Obviously this is an inquiry about violence against women and girls, but we thought in this session we wanted to look particularly at FGM. Perhaps just to start it off, the UK Government has set some ambitious targets. Home Ofce Minister Jeremy Browne has said that we have to recognise that, if we are to take a lead in tacklingIf a women is not happy and she is in a violent situation, it affects the children, it affects the men, it affects everyone, especially in our context. If your Mum is happy and she is at peace, the children will go to school, the husband will go to work smart, everything will go well. Once she is angry, then nobody in the house will be happy. It is very important to look at the issue of violence against women. It seems something small, but if you have an angry Mum in the house, then there will be chaos for everybody, but if women are peaceful, that will contribute to development, it will reduce poverty, and it will save a lot of money that we are using in other areas. If we had a situation where women were peaceful, and we had prevented violence or taken care of the women who have undergone violence and set in place clear-cut indicators that countries can report on, it would make a whole difference. Chair: I think, Annmarie, you have summed it up perfectly. Let me say from the Chair that the education and empowerment of women is in men's interests, and we have to work on it together. Thank you both very much indeed for coming and sharing with us your experiences. Bernice Sam: Thank you very much. Annmarie Mavenjina: Thank you. it internationally, we have to do something about it nationally. I suppose the rst question is: do you agree with that? Perhaps I could start with the police dimension. DCS Keith Niven: Certainly. We do agree with that. We very much acknowledge the difculties around investigating these cases, but we certainly think there is an opportunity nationally to work closer together in relation to this. Obviously the police perspective is that we investigate any allegations of crimes of this nature, and seek to prosecute, but also we have a responsibility in relation to safeguarding, because our child protection responsibilities are safeguarding and prosecuting offenders. I would certainly support a co- ordinated national approach, which I do not think is something that is robust at the moment, because as you have pointed out, if we have a national approach and co-ordination here, that can extend across and overseas as well. Chair: I suppose the point I am making is that the British Government have said they want to see FGM eliminated worldwide within 25 years, but you have to start here if it is happening in the UK, and we will come back to that in a bit more detail. DCS Keith Niven: Yes, absolutely. Q28 Chair: Would you like to comment as well? Perhaps also at the same time you might say, \"Why is it so high?\" The gures we are getting on theEv 12 International Development Committee: Evidence 12 February 2013 Detective Chief Superintendent Keith Niven, Detective Chief Inspector Iqbal Singh, Efua Dorkenoo OBE and Nimco Ali incidence of FGM show it is not so high in the UK but it is here, and it is very high in some parts of the world. Why do you think that is, and what do you think the UK, specically, should be doing about it? Efua Dorkenoo: In terms of the scale of the problem, I was speaking with the WHO just recently. They are going to come out with the actual gures, and it looks as if we are now talking about, for Africa and the Yemen, 110 million girls and women affected, and 3.3 million girls under the age of 15 at risk of it. The WHO will release a key document somewhere in the middle of this year. FGM is linked to ethnicity, although we can have this huge range: in places like Egypt the prevalence is 91%, in Somalia it is 98%, and we have a lot of Somalis here in the UK as well. In Sierra Leone it is also about 80% to 90%; in Mali it is in the 90% range, but when you come to other countries, like Ghana, it is only 5%. Although,you should also not be misled: if in Ghana it is about r 5%, in the regions, in terms of the ethnic groups who practice it, it is very high. Q29 Chair: It is a particular group in which it is high. Efua Dorkenoo: Yes, It is more to do with ethnicity, and the ethnicity goes beyond borders. We are now clear that in Indonesia FGM is a big issue rather than stopping it, the government is trying to medicalise FGM. FGM is reportedin Malaysia and in parts of Pakistan\u2014certain sects practise it. We are now getting more evidence that it is practised among theIraqi Kurds, and even in parts of South America, amongst indigenous populations\u2014I think it is in Colombia. FGM has become an international issue through migration. For the UK it is estimated that 66,000 women are affected and are living with FGM and more than 24,000 girls below the age of 15 are at risk of female genital mutilation. Because of the migration and the movement of people from countries where FGM is prevalent to the developed world, it has become an international issue. Q30 Chair: That implies two different things. One is that people are migrating here who have suffered it, but equally that there is a generation of girls here\u2014 you say 24,000\u2014who are at risk. By \"at risk\", do you mean they are in communities that are likely to want to perform it on them, within this country? Efua Dorkenoo: Yes. Chair: Or do they send them abroad to have it done? Efua Dorkenoo: They send them abroad. We do not have the full picture. Anecdotal information suggests that it also happens to girls in the UK. The gures I gave you are based on 2001 statistics. We need new gures now. Chair: So it might be much worse. Efua Dorkenoo: Yes, it has probably increased. We have had a lot of migration from these areas, because of the upheavals in some of these areas, like the Horn of Africa, sometimes also from West Africa, for a time Liberia and Sierra Leone, because of Britain's continued relationship with countries where there are colonial ties and all that. There are linkages with areas where FGM is very high. It will be very difcult forDFID to focus just on Africa, because if we do not have our house right here, we do not have the voice to address the issue over there. Q31 Chair: Perhaps a comment from you, Nimco, and then I will come back. Nimco Ali: Though I welcome the focus on FGM specically, I think we need to stop looking at it as a separate issue. It is a form of violence against women, and it has not been dealt with because we have put it in this cultural cul-de-sac. Where FGM is predominant, it stems from the inequality of women, and that is how violence against women manifests itself. We have FGM in the places we have forced marriage and so on. For me FGM is a major issue in this country. I grew up in this country; a lot of my counterparts were born in this country, and we are all survivors of female genital mutilation. There is this view of looking at it as though it is something happening through ignorance. It is not happening through ignorance. It is a form of control and oppression of women within those populations. For me, we cannot do anything internationally if we cannot do anything here nationally, because it is the same issue. We are not looking at FGM in terms of its root cause, and that is the inequality of women within those populations that they live in. The law that we have here is also quite inept, in the sense that we have thought of FGM as a cultural issue and not a form of violence against women, so we have legislation here where girls from specic communities are thought to be at risk of FGM, and other girls are legitimately allowed to have FGM on the NHS. We have to question ourselves and look at what female genital mutilation is. Q32 Chair: Sorry, are you saying it is happening on the NHS? Nimco Ali: FGM as dened by the World Health Organisation, which is the cutting of the female genitalia without any medical reasoning, is something that is not only common in Africa but common across the world, and there are procedures on the NHS called labioplasty that are equivalent to a form of FGM that happens in parts of Africa and the developing world. We need to have those kinds of questions of not othering women and talking about the issues of FGM as being unacceptable on the one hand but acceptable on the other. It is unacceptable in all its forms, and we work with young women from multiple communities, whether they are from Africa or from the UK, who have undergone FGM and have identied as saying that they have undergone FGM. For me that is the primary issue. Q33 Chair: I am sure my colleagues will want to pursue that point, but just before they do, perhaps just turning to the police, you have said that you accept it is an issue that needs to be addressed and we need to do more about it, but the reality is that we have just heard that there are girls in this country at risk. Apparently it is happening in this country, whether it is in or out of the NHS. In fact, you can argue that itInternational Development Committee: Evidence Ev 13 12 February 2013 Detective Chief Superintendent Keith Niven, Detective Chief Inspector Iqbal Singh, Efua Dorkenoo OBE and Nimco Ali is not just the criminal offence of FGM; it is child abuse, because these girls are underage. DCS Keith Niven: It is child abuse. Chair: Yet\u2014and tell me if this is true\u2014there have only been three referrals in the last 30 years to the CPS, and no prosecutions. How is this? If I can just make the point, clearly some of these girls will present to the NHS, we are told, either because at the end of pregnancy they are not able to deliver and they have emergency caesareans, or they have some kind of infection that forces them to go. Is there no crossover of information between the health service and the police that would lead to prosecutions or referrals? DCS Keith Niven: Yes. The gures I have been provided with in relation to this\u2014and this is since 2009, when we started to monitor any information or cases that might be referred to us in relation to FGM, either directly or indirectly\u2014are that we have records of 148 referrals. Chair: You have 148? DCS Keith Niven: Referrals to Chair: In what time period? DCS Keith Niven: Since 2009. In relation to those, they are not all allegations of crime. They would be referred to us from potentially health or social services, local safeguarding children boards, in relation to women who have been subjected to this. Because that has been established, then it has been referred to us as, \"Potentially there could be a risk of other children going through this process, or criminal offences.\" They have all been investigated, and we have a duty and absolutely a responsibility to investigate all those referrals. We do those both by the police themselves and in partnership with social services, because we have joint investigations in child protection. Our records show that we have referred six cases to the CPS, and we think there is only another one in the country that has been referred that we are aware of. There are a number of difculties that have been presented to us in relation to this. In fact we have one recent case on which we have worked very much in partnership, where we had a victim who had come forward and that case was progressing, but more recently the victim has pulled back from this because they are very concerned about the punishment that may be administered to family members. There are many dynamics we have to consider in relation to this, but certainly from a police perspective, if we receive an allegation of FGM, you are absolutely right: it is child abuse, it is regarded as child abuse, and it is investigated as such. To date, however, and you are correct around this, there have not been any prosecutions in the UK for this. When you think about the 148 referrals, of which a very small percentage actually relate to the crime itself, it opens up a much wider issue. That wider issue is about the condence of victims and families coming to the police to report these matters and, once they have reported them, then following those through to support criminal prosecution. We do not underestimate the enormity of the task here, working closely with partners, both withlocal safeguarding children boards, health and education. There is certainly a training issue in relation to all the agencies, so that these crimes can be recognised, and certainly the Children's Commissioner more recently has introduced a risk matrix relating to child sexual exploitation. I think there is certainly some scope here for something along those lines, so that all the agencies can see. Certainly if children are being taken abroad, what are the signs? How can we identify that children are being taken abroad for this purpose? It is all about intelligence, and condence in the police and the agencies. You are absolutely correct, however, that there have no prosecutions that I am aware of for this form of child abuse. Q35 Pauline Latham: Do you think you have sufcient resources to deal with the problem? Clearly the numbers you have talked about are the tip of the iceberg, I suggest, in this country. Do you have the resources? How many Met Police ofcers are dedicated to investigating FGM, and are they women or are they men? DCS Keith Niven: We have a partnership team. There are two parts to this: investigation of the crime, but partnership as well to enhance and cement relationships with other agencies. I have 16 child abuse investigation teams across London, and a number of other teams that specialise in more covert and proactive work. My partnership team, which is a small team headed by DCI Singh, has about six individuals in total. They have a number of responsibilities, and one of their responsibilities is to build those relationships and look to the other partners and outside agencies. If these investigations are reported to the police, I have 16 child abuse investigation teams across London who will investigate these matters, and they will apply the same level of resources as they would to any child abuse investigation. Q36 Pauline Latham: If a case is reported to you, what exactly do you do? What is the procedure for getting it referred to the CPS and therefore prosecution\u2014which obviously we know has not happened? DCS Keith Niven: We obviously work very closely with our partners, local safeguarding children boards and social services, because safeguarding is primary. Do we need to address these issues for the victim? Is this something that is going to happen in the future? Are there other children at risk? We would have a strategy meeting straight away in relation to that with social services. Then we would look to proceed as we would in any other criminal investigation, whereby we would need to speak to the victim. There would be an interview; trained police ofcers would deal with it if a child was involved, for example. Those interviews would take place. Safeguarding would take place around the child. Once we had gained that evidence, that initial evidence, we would look to corroborate that. It may be that we would look for other family members, other witnesses, people who might have arranged transportEv 14 International Development Committee: Evidence 12 February 2013 Detective Chief Superintendent Keith Niven, Detective Chief Inspector Iqbal Singh, Efua Dorkenoo OBE and Nimco Ali to take the victims abroad, and then we would be looking to see whether we could corroborate that abroad, which is very difcult, but they would be the areas we would look to. Very early on we would communicate with the Crown Prosecution Service, and that is an agreement that we have with the Crown Prosecution Service. We meet with them and have early intervention from them to review the cases at a very early stage. That would be the process, and once we had gathered sufcient evidence, the CPS would then apply their test to see whether or not this would be a matter that would then go to prosecution, and those tests are applied to all cases that we put before the CPS. Q37 Fiona O'Donnell: Good morning, everyone. I am more familiar with the Scottish system in terms of safeguarding children, but I wondered whether you heard one of the witnesses in the previous session, from Ghana, saying that the person who is involved in sending the child for cutting is also charged? DCS Keith Niven: Yes. Fiona O'Donnell: Surely in this country, if a parent sends their child to be cut, that child would be put on the Child Protection Register? DCS Keith Niven: Absolutely. The situation would be, obviously, once we had that information and if the child was at risk, then that child, as in many cases\u2014 Q38 Fiona O'Donnell: \"Was at risk\"? DCS Keith Niven: If the child was at risk of that procedure actually taking place. Let us, for example, say we have information that a child is going to be taken out of the country to have this procedure. Then if the system is working correctly and the information is put to the agencies and the police, we would take steps to remove that child from danger, or remove the danger from the child. You are absolutely right that the people who commit the crimes are the people who perform the act and also the people who arrange for that to take place. The parents would be liable for criminal prosecution, as would be the people who booked the flights, as would be the people who ensured the transition of that process. They would all be liable to that. Q39 Fiona O'Donnell: So where it has been identied that that has happened to a child, would that child go onto the Child Protection Register? DCS Keith Niven: It would be a matter for social services to review that case. They certainly would have a strategy discussion and a case conference in relation to the safety of that child. Q40 Fiona O'Donnell: I realise, as you say, there would be a case conference, but if a parent allowed their daughter to be cut in that way, that child would not automatically always go onto the Child Protection Register. If you could allow someone to do that to your child, you are not safeguarding your child. DCS Keith Niven: I am not saying that they would not automatically, but each case is dealt with on its merits. That would be a matter for the chair of thesafeguarding board, but like you, I think there are risks there and those risks have to be addressed. Q41 Pauline Latham: How many people are you aware that has happened to? DCS Keith Niven: In relation to children going on the Child Protection Register? Pauline Latham: Yes. DCS Keith Niven: I am not aware of any going on the Child Protection Register. Q42 Pauline Latham: And yet you know of girls who have been cut, presumably? You know of those, but nobody has been put on the Child Protection Register? DCS Keith Niven: I am not aware of any, but that is not to say that they have not. In relation to the most recent case, that child is not with the family, so that is an individual who has been the victim of this crime, has come to us subsequently, and in liaison with the social services. However, that liaison with the social services had taken place before this matter had come to light, so that individual is safeguarded, because they are not within the family themselves. We have investigated a lot of the referrals we have had and we have arrested people, but there has not been any evidence. There might be information that comes to us from other family members, but when we investigate it, it has not been substantiated. Those incidents are referred to the social services, and the social services make judgments on the information they have. Q43 Pauline Latham: Is not the evidence the fact that she has been cut? That is fairly obvious evidence. You have either been cut or you have not been cut. DCS Keith Niven: Absolutely, but a lot of our cases have been referrals where there have not been cuts. Of 148, a large percentage of those are information\u2014 Pauline Latham: They might be. DCS Keith Niven: There is potential, maybe, might have been, and when they have been investigated, that evidence has not been forthcoming. However, each case is dealt with on an individual basis, and if there is a child that has been cut, then we would seek to prosecute if we could gain the evidence to do so. Q44 Pauline Latham: Could I just go back to the fact that Nimco Ali said this is happening on the NHS? Could you perhaps tell us a little bit more about that? I am pretty shocked to hear that. How many children are being cut on the NHS? Nimco Ali: There is a caveat within the FGM legislation for forms of cutting that apply only to girls from African communities. So the data is quite loose, but I think about 300 girls were cut last year alone from Bristol\u2014girls under the age of 16 who asked for labioplasty, which is a form of female genital mutilation that we would dene as activist. For us, the confusion is that we cannot have this going on while we at the same time try to protect the children. In terms of looking at where FGM is common within those populations within the UK, the scenario that the police talk about is a very wishful one, but it is notInternational Development Committee: Evidence Ev 15 12 February 2013 Detective Chief Superintendent Keith Niven, Detective Chief Inspector Iqbal Singh, Efua Dorkenoo OBE and Nimco Ali one that is in operation at the moment. Children are not being protected, and we subsequently meet young women who have gone through FGM and also other forms of abuse. It is only then that they are removed from their families or they leave the family themselves. One of the things that are going on at the moment is that there are a lot of cultural eggshells being walked on, and political correctness, and police not stepping in, and parents are being allowed to do these things. For us, the way we can get a conviction or prosecution is for us to actively prevent FGM. It is not necessarily just about the police and the CPS, but it is about teachers and social workers actively engaging in protecting these girls who have undergone FGM or are at risk of FGM. If I just give you a stat that we got last week from Bristol, in one area of Bristol in the last quarter 173 women presented at maternity having undergone FGM. One of the risk factors that we have is that, if a woman has undergone FGM, then her daughter is at risk of FGM, and social services, the NHS and the midwives should be on notice. Out of those 173 women, if 40 of those are girls, then that is 40 girls being born in one hospital in Bristol that are at risk of FGM, but nobody is doing anything about it, because we are too politically correct. Q45 Fiona O'Donnell: And there may be younger daughters in the family who are still in the care of the parents. Nimco Ali: Yes, or who have undergone FGM. One of the main issues is the fact that I know, as a six-year-old undergoing FGM, I had nobody to talk to. I told my teacher but she was not interested. The fact is that six-year-olds today are still at risk of FGM and they have nobody to talk to and nobody to tell. For us to expect a child to come forward with the evidence for a conviction is quite inept from our perspective. We as adults need to understand that the duty is upon us to seek that information and seek protection of these children. Q46 Pauline Latham: I could see DCS Keith Niven jumping up and down there. Do you have a view on that? DCS Keith Niven: Absolutely right. When there is information and evidence that children are at risk, then intervention must take place; I absolutely agree with that. I obviously do not know the examples from Bristol, but it is about safeguarding children, and that is with social services. This is where I speak about closer interagency working, and certainly working with other organisations to identify those risk factors. How do we identify those? Are we getting the referrals from health? That is a very good source of information: where individuals have gone through this process, other family members may be at risk. What we have found is that we have a lack of information in relation to whether this is being committed in the UK, and if it is, who is doing it. That is an area we would like to explore with this. We have had very little information put forward, and I understand the reasons why there are sensitivitiesand people might not want to come to the police, but there are other ways in which information can come to us. Certainly we worked with two African Well Women's Clinics in London recently, and we had a seminar where we invited people to come and speak to us. We have produced a questionnaire that does not seek to identify people or to breach condentiality in any way but to see whether or not we can scope the issue, and through those organisations say, \"You can talk to the police.\" It is about trust and condence. Now post the Savile allegations, I am hoping the condence that the public have now gained because of Savile can permeate out as well into other areas where communities do not feel condent to come to the police. Working with the African Well Women's group, with a questionnaire, will give us an opportunity to gain that information, because we want to nd out, if it is taking place here, who is doing it. Then we can take action independently of the victim, so the pressure on the victim is not necessarily as much as it would be for other prosecutions, because we could independently nd out who is doing it and gain evidence in other ways. I would certainly welcome working with our colleagues here in relation to that. Q47 Pauline Latham: Is Project Azure still operational? DCS Keith Niven: It is still operational, and very active. Q48 Pauline Latham: It is? The website has gone down, apparently. It appears to have been taken down. But it is still going ahead? DCI Iqbal Singh: It is still going ahead. Project Azure is just a Metropolitan Police initiative, not a national initiative, but I will have a look at that, just to see. DCS Keith Niven: I am grateful for that, but Project Azure is very much up and running, and that is our partnership approach. Just to reinforce that, the investigation is conducted by my teams that investigate child abuse. Q49 Richard Burden: You have emphasised the importance of interagency working. What is your liaison like with other police forces? Given the fact that the prevalence of FGM will be concentrated in particular communities, which themselves will often be located and concentrated in particular areas, what is that liaison like? Do any of you, as well as looking to other Mets or other forces, make visits overseas to try to look at that end of the chain, and then work back to what is happening here to assist in your enquiries? DCS Keith Niven: We have an ACPO lead, Carmel Napier, who is the national ACPO lead for this form of child abuse, and we have the National Police Improvement Agency as well, who have a lead in relation to this. Talking about international communications, DCI Singh chaired a meeting before Christmas in relation to European police forces, and we went to Belgium to present how we have dealt with issues here and what our processes are\u2014certainly with the French and the Dutch. DCI Singh might be able to expand on it, but we certainly have anEv 16 International Development Committee: Evidence 12 February 2013 Detective Chief Superintendent Keith Niven, Detective Chief Inspector Iqbal Singh, Efua Dorkenoo OBE and Nimco Ali international communication around this. Of course, because a lot of these acts take place abroad, they are areas we want to very much explore. There is that liaison there, but at the moment obviously from the Metropolitan Police point of view, it is very much about how we deal with the problem in London, with the wider view to where this is happening and the views and education abroad as well, which is maybe where you could have an influence on our behalf. Q50 Richard Burden: I think it is probably me; I missed the rst part of your answer to that. You have been to conferences and seminars in Europe to present what the Met does? DCS Keith Niven: Yes, absolutely. Richard Burden: My question was also about whether or not there is the liaison with countries in parts of the developing world where FGM may be carried out, or indeed other countries in Europe where FGM may be carried out, for UK citizens. Do those kinds of visits take place? DCS Keith Niven: I think there has probably been very little into non-European countries. Certainly my knowledge is around European liaison, but I do not think it has expanded out on a particularly wide scale from the UK to liaison with African countries. I know that the Foreign and Commonwealth Ofce have; I spoke to somebody a couple of weeks ago\u2014and this is an area we are going to explore as well\u2014in relation to how we can move this forward with the Foreign and Commonwealth Ofce, because that is how we would formulate our liaison, and also with Interpol as well. They are areas we need to refocus on, and pursue and develop. So far we have gained liaison with European partners and colleagues but not the wider world. Q51 Richard Burden: Even within Europe, are there any best practices that we can follow? The way you put it is that the Met has been going to seminars in Europe to explain how the Met is doing it. DCS Keith Niven: Yes. Richard Burden: I am sure the Met is doing some good stuff, but one of the concerns we have flagged up is that we are still dealing with a situation over here where there have been no prosecutions. DCS Keith Niven: Absolutely. Richard Burden: Is that best practice? Are we learning anything from anywhere else? DCS Keith Niven: We are. We spoke with the French. The French have success in this area; they have gained a number of prosecutions, and they raised two cases that were investigated. I think one involved the death of a child, and another one where a victim came forward. From those two stages they were able to expand out and gain the evidence and information in relation to a number of others. The French have been successful, albeit that the French legal system is very different. That was one of the discussions we had, and that is why we have taken that back to the Crown Prosecution Service, to say, \"We need to look at other ways around prosecutions.\"I go back to my thoughts around Jimmy Savile and that particular case, because the DPP came out very shortly after the report was published, a number of weeks ago, and said that there was work ongoing looking at prosecutions with vulnerable victims. The victims of these crimes are absolutely vulnerable victims, and they have the same issues about condence in coming forward and the courts system. Recent cases have exposed the difculties in court cases of victims giving evidence. That is very much an area that I know the CPS are looking at, and we are working closely with them. It is those areas. We have looked at other countries, and we have looked at their successes. We have also looked at their laws that are different from the laws here, and that is a question that has now been put back to the DPP and to the CPS as well. Q52 Richard Burden: Just one last question. You mentioned the ACPO lead; is that the Met? DCS Keith Niven: No, is not. It is Carmel Napier. DCI Iqbal Singh: Carmel Napier is the Chief Constable of Gwent. She has the lead on FGM. Q53 Chris White: In your last answer you mentioned vulnerable victims coming forward and you mentioned condence. What practical steps could victims be given to support them coming forward, in your view? DCS Keith Niven: Certainly it is all about communication, in my view, in relation to this. There is a schools intervention. We have certainly worked with schools; we assisted in putting together a DVD and a video to get that communication out, but if you look at victims who are going to come forward and give evidence against their families, which in essence will happen, there are a number of ways of doing that. Certainly it can be done through social services, so that is a safeguarding issue. There is a safeguarding issue regardless of whether people give evidence at all, and that safeguarding issue can certainly complement the protection and support that is provided to vulnerable victims. For example, victims would be video-interviewed; the victims might not necessarily have to give live evidence in court. Their identities would be protected\u2014all these other areas of protection that are afforded to victims in other crimes as well, if they are going to give live evidence. However, it is twofold; it is about supporting those victims to go forward to a court process, if that is the outcome, and it is also safeguarding those victims if they are at risk of this type of crime. Q54 Chris White: Do you consider it difcult to prosecute for FGM? DCS Keith Niven: The situation is that we have referred cases to the Crown Prosecution Service and there have been difculties, so yes, it is a difcult area to prosecute. It is difcult to get people to have the condence to come forward. I hope that now, post-Savile, we have demonstrated that people can come forward, they do have a voice, they will be listened to, and we will support them.International Development Committee: Evidence Ev 17 12 February 2013 Detective Chief Superintendent Keith Niven, Detective Chief Inspector Iqbal Singh, Efua Dorkenoo OBE and Nimco Ali Q55 Chris White: There is a difference between somebody coming forward, and somebody coming forward and then a prosecution. DCS Keith Niven: Yes. Historically, as part of investigations and prosecutions, we have looked at victims and put all the emphasis on what the victim can do. I go back to what I said originally: we want the victims to come forward; we want the information that the victims have; we want that intelligence that we can then go and develop. I am looking for ways to prosecute individuals who commit these crimes, but is that possible without having to rely solely on the victim? I think it is. I think we do get that information, but it is about getting the victims to us, and reassuring them that they can come and talk to us and we will not pressurise them. That has happened in many cases with victims of other crimes; it is that pressure, and we will not put that pressure on them. Q56 Chris White: Just following up from Mrs Latham's question earlier, prosecution or child protection legislation was used in a particular case, and FGM was part of that. Was that just part of it, or were there so many other things that the child was taken into care? DCS Keith Niven: In the case we mentioned, the child was already in care, and they came forward and disclosed to us that the crime that had taken place. That was a slightly different situation probably from the majority, but in that particular case we were able to go ahead and gain the evidence, and the evidence has been very clear. At this point it is at a very sensitive stage in the case, and I cannot go into detail around it, but the individual now has concerns about taking that to the next stage, and that is about reassurance and engagement with the Crown Prosecution Service, which we will engage in over the next couple of weeks. Q57 Chris White: It is also about making prosecutions. DCS Keith Niven: It is about making prosecutions. The prosecution will send a very, very clear message to individuals. There could be a range of people that are subject to those prosecutions. It is not necessarily that we have to rely totally on that victim. That is where I am trying to drive this forward and to look for other options. DCI Iqbal Singh: It has to be borne in mind as well that the burden of proof for us is quite high, as well: it is beyond reasonable doubt. With the evidence we have had to gather, it is going to be for the prosecution to actually present the case and prove that the offence has occurred, rather than the onus being on the defendant. If you look at some of the European countries, their burden of proof is very, very much lower. France does not have its own legislation in terms of FGM; it uses its own normal legislation in terms of assault on children, abuse on children, whereas we in this country have our own FGM legislation, which has not been tested as yet, because we have not had a prosecution.Q58 Fiona O'Donnell: I still, maybe na\u00efvely, struggle with this, because if the evidence is there that a girl or a woman has undergone cutting\u2014and if it is a child, the parent has responsibility\u2014and they do not provide the evidence as to how that happened, they are perverting the course of justice. As I say, maybe that is na\u00efve. It has been illegal in this country now for 30 years. Does anyone have any sense of how many girls or women we have kept safe or prevented this happening to? Nimco Ali: Prevention is very weak. It is the fact that if parents do not want to do it, then they will not. It is about the specic family and why they decide not to carry out FGM. For me, things are changing within certain populations. If I speak about the community I come from, the Somali community, it is quite poignant in this context as well, because we need to look at the international links. In regions of Somalia, for example Somaliland, it is supported specically by the diaspora. Any work and any money that is invested in looking at FGM or violence against women there has to be mutually matched here, and the work done. FGM will probably decrease to a certain extent within the diaspora, but only because there are more stringent forms of Islam or other forms of control on girls, controlling freedoms. We have young women coming forward, saying, \"Would I have FGM and have a free education from all these other things that would happen to me, or would I be safe from FGM but have all these restrictions placed upon me?' I do not necessarily think the law has protected anybody. I know personally that the duty of protection has been placed upon young women within the families to protect their sisters, and that is what has happened. The fact is that the FGM legislation has not been tested; it has not been tested because there has not been that condence from survivors to say, \"I need to go forward to the police. I need to go forward to Social Services,\" in order to prevent FGM. It is being done within the family. That kind of protection has happened. Efua Dorkenoo: I wanted to say that research on FGM in this country is very poor, but a few qualitative studies that have been done show that, amongst groups who practise the worst forms, inbulation, there is a shift towards clitoridectomy. That is the change we are seeing. The same qualitative research also indicates that FGM is still not strongly discussed within communities that practise it, and also there is a very strong attitude towards supporting it. I wanted to come back to the issue of the police. I think the police are the last line. The key issue that we have missed until quite recently is to understand that most of the FGM is done to kids under the age of 10. Sometimes it is done to the older girl, and the trend that we are seeing is that it may be done to the older girl if families think they are changing, they are becoming too Westernised, and they are not able to control them. Then they will enforce FGM on them at the age of, say, 15 years or 17 years in the Somali community, but traditionally they would do it between six and seven years old. What we are talking about is that most of the victims who are affected are under the age of 10, and looking at trends even in Africa,Ev 18 International Development Committee: Evidence 12 February 2013 Detective Chief Superintendent Keith Niven, Detective Chief Inspector Iqbal Singh, Efua Dorkenoo OBE and Nimco Ali parents are reducing the ages because the older ones may resist it as they get more information about it. In this country we have not put a proper system in place to track and work with these families, which may be where the gaps are. I would totally agree that FGM in this country is primarily a safeguarding issue, and because the children do not have a voice, it needs a holistic, comprehensive approach. Government and the institutions on one hand will need to put certain systems in place, and then there is also the other bit about addressing social norms, and women's organisations and women's rights organisations challenging it, to balance it. The kids have denitely are speaking out. The main development is they have come out to say that Government should not throw them back to the community. If you look at the policy, we do accept it is violence against women and it is a safeguarding issue, but then the Government throws the onus on women's rights organisations to deal with it in the community, even to the extent that sometimes, when the issues come to the attention of health professionals or teachers, they eject it to civil society organisations to deal with it. What I am trying to say is that we have a lot of guidelines, but we need a system in place, and there are different departments who are duty bound to address FGM. If it is safeguarding, it is cross-cutting across health, social care and teachers. If FGM happens to girls mainly at the primary school stage,we should ask ourselves what are we going to do about that? When the children are older, they are past that stage. What is missing is this mechanism; if we talk about multi-agency working, the joined-up working is not working. It is not. Q59 Fiona O'Donnell: We know that often when we fail children and do not keep them safe, it is because health does not talk to education and social services. Every organisation in this country that deals with children should have a child protection policy in place, so they have a duty of care. Nimco mentioned earlier that she thought we were too culturally sensitive and that that is preventing us from getting to grips with this. Efua, you have been talking about having systems in place. What would those systems be? If we know that in a certain diaspora there is a high prevalence, should those children be subject to medical examination to establish whether or not it had occurred, and for parents to be aware that was going to happen? In terms of the work the police are doing, are you engaging with faith and community leaders to challenge this practice, and are they co-operating and working with you? That is a lot of questions. Nimco Ali: I think it is about empowerment and support of children, and allowing them to be individuals of the state they are present in. That is what the EU has done, and that is what Holland and France and other countries have done. That is why they have had prosecutions. What is really interesting is that, within the early 2000s, when Holland embedded a lot of this legislation around FGM, they knew that they had a part of the population that was committing those activities and they said, \"This is illegal.\" They just brought it into other forms of childabuse. Those populations came to the UK, and subsequently several hundred of those girls underwent FGM, because they were then living in the UK. It is about us understanding FGM as a form of violence and child abuse, and dealing with it as we would anything else. For me, journalists and people ask me, \"If I know somebody is going to undergo FGM, how do I contact you?\" That is the issue. If you know a child that is at risk of FGM, call the police; do not call me. It is about that whole understanding and acceptance that FGM is not a cultural act; it is a form of violence and control. We also have to be careful within the tones and in the conversation we have, because a lot of the time we are talking to perpetrators, and communicating their words back to ourselves and also to the children. Children will not come forward; they will not trust the police if they see you standing side by side with the men and the women within the community who are perpetrating these crimes. For example, we have conversations that are happening in certain parts of the country where people are saying there is a move from a certain form of FGM to another. That has come from community members who have beneted from FGM. If you go back to the home countries of these children's parents, for example Somalia, where we think that Type 1 FGM is now common, there has been research done that, when cutters were spoken to and asked, \"What does Type 1 look like?\" Type 1 was closer to what Type 3 is in the denition of the World Health Organisation. We have these young children coming back, with parents who are the perpetrators saying, \"Oh, I did nothing but just a mere prick,\" and us accepting that. I think that is totally unacceptable, and we cannot be having these conversations with the parents negotiating about the safety and the future of these children. We need to say, \"It is about the protection of the child. We can have a conversation about your culture and whatever you believe in, but it is about the protection of the child.\" For too long we have been having these conversations with the community members, and also pushing the children into an identity that they have not chosen for themselves. Q60 Fiona O'Donnell: Sorry, we are short of time and I want to make sure I get an answer from the police. DCS Keith Niven: Certainly. Where we talked about investigations being conducted by my team of investigators, the partnership is around the partnership team. I have a list here of the partners that we have liaised with. There are 12 medical partners\u2014they are hospitals and clinics\u2014eight national charities, ve local charities and 15 local authority local safeguarding children boards. There is that intervention and those communications are taking place. Q61 Fiona O'Donnell: And with faith leaders as well? DCI Iqbal Singh: Faith leaders is something we are going to start work on, because that is where we nd that we can engage in that element there. That isInternational Development Committee: Evidence Ev 19 12 February 2013 Detective Chief Superintendent Keith Niven, Detective Chief Inspector Iqbal Singh, Efua Dorkenoo OBE and Nimco Ali where we will try to percolate some of the messages out. Q62 Fiona O'Donnell: Why has that not happened before? I know it is probably quite difcult for you to say, but is it about political will? Are people worried about cultural sensitivities? DCI Iqbal Singh: It is probably that and many more. It is very, very difcult to try to engage with some of these hard-to-reach communities. What we want to do is build up condence and be able to have those conversations, but that is a bit of work that needs to be done, and that is an element that we have identied that we have to do a lot of work around. DCS Keith Niven: I think as well it is identifying the right people\u2014the people who actually do not agree with this. That is some of the difculty, and when you do some research around it\u2014we have found it with other communities as well\u2014it is difcult, but that is the challenge and that is what we have to do. We have to identify the people who can speak to communities and be respected by communities so that their word is listened to, and they can work with us and other organisations. That work is certainly ongoing, and we are certainly refocusing on that, as DCI Singh has said, to nd those individuals. The starting point, for me, is the victims. The starting point is the victims and the charities that support those victims. I think there has been an awful lot of fear around engaging with the police, for a variety of reasons. Those can be people's own experiences in their own countries, or it can be experiences in the UK. Once we gain that trust and condence, then we can start to move this forward. In relation to individuals and perceived fear, we have arrested numerous people in relation to this and we are very positive around that policy. Even this weekend, where information was gained that somebody was thinking about taking their child for FGM, they were arrested, brought into custody, and they were interviewed about that. We do not stand back from that, and when we get information, we take action in relation to it. Education is a much wider issue, but it is absolutely right what is said. Children in primary school are the children who are at risk. It is for education and health, together with the police, to make sure that that information is out there. Q63 Fiona O'Donnell: I am so conscious of the time, but, very quickly, I asked about having medical examinations of children to establish whether or not it has taken place. Is that going too far? Efua Dorkenoo: The key issue is early intervention and prevention. Fiona O'Donnell: And detecting and prosecuting. Efua Dorkenoo: Yes. Maternity. The women who have FGM are delivering. They may have a daughter, and it is six years down the line that FGM happens to that daughter. Therefore, that information of the child being at risk should be passed on to the health visitor, or the GP, so that they can engage in conversation. There is a lot of resistance in the UK to physically checking the girls. In France, under the age of six,checking the girls is part of the children's development checks on how they are growing.All children are inspected genitally. In this country it is not done, and there are a lot of discussions around whether it would be proling if you focus just on the girls at risk of FGM. I think what we need is soft monitoring. If the information that this child is at risk of FGM is passed on to the health visitor, so that it goes onto the children's red book, the health visitor continues with the prevention messages, and always keeping an eye on that child. Parents then become aware that the state is serious, so they are really petried of doing FGM Right now, in the community, the parents and community members say, \"Britain does not have the guts to punish anybody.\" It should has be mandatory that health professionals report if they do come across it. At the moment it is not. The DPP has actually set up a working group to look at the barriers to prosecution, and one of the key issues is he is looking intois reporting: until health professionals report, the police will not get the information. Q64 Pauline Latham: That is what I was going to ask a question about. If the Department of Health mandated health workers and midwives to report it, would that become a barrier, because the vulnerable women would not then be allowed to go and see those people? Would it cause more of a problem than it would solve? Efua Dorkenoo: I spoke with the Royal College of Midwives, and they do not think it will be a barrier. Very soon we will have young women delivering who were born within the period of the law on the extra-territoriality came in, for example. Should midwives who come across those women report it for follow-up? Nimco Ali: Domestic abuse was put on the radar of the midwives, and they had to report that and follow that up; it is similar to that in terms of the violence against women framework. DCS Keith Niven: It is part of safeguarding, because if you do have those women, then their children could potentially be at risk. It is that information that then would go into the system, and action could be taken. If that information is not coming forward, that is where there is a vulnerability here\u2014a very strong vulnerability. Q65 Chair: The point was made to us, I think, in evidence that, in France, the whole approach to immigration, of course, is that once you become a citizen, you are not an immigrant; you are a French citizen, and you conform. We are very much following our multicultural society approach. It suggests that we tiptoe around these things. I think what you are saying is that we should not be quite so tippy-toes about it. Nimco Ali: I think a term of assimilation needs to be required, and also acceptance of young people that are born in this country, rather than us othering them and identifying them as a culture that they have not necessarily chosen or belong to. Chair: That is a clear distinction.Ev 20 International Development Committee: Evidence 12 February 2013 Detective Chief Superintendent Keith Niven, Detective Chief Inspector Iqbal Singh, Efua Dorkenoo OBE and Nimco Ali Nimco Ali: One of the questions I was asked was about the international situation. There is a large number of young diaspora communities that are being taken back because they are believed to be too westernised. We need to be aware that a lot of our citizens are now living in the Horn of Africa. How do we protect those? There is no avenue for those young women to come forward, whether they are being forced into marriage or they will specically be undergoing FGM, and there are no routes for that. The UK Government talks about eradicating FGM as though it were this thing that will be vaccinated against, but we need to understand that, unless we deal with the root causes of violence against women and the inequality of women within those populations, we will not be able to do that. We have a conference here in May about the Somali community, and there has been a commitment to the diaspora, but we need to understand that women are suffering and young people in this country are suffering. Chair: You have made a good point. I do not know if we have the statistical information on the number of British citizens who have been returned, effectively, but that is important. Q66 Jeremy Lefroy: Good morning. Written evidence from the NGO FORWARD highlights the lack of any dened commitments between the Foreign Ofce, the Home Ofce and the UK Border Agency regarding FGM as especially concerning. To your knowledge, is the Home Ofce taking any steps to track at-risk girls? Do they make overseas visits? You mentioned one earlier, but do they make them to see whether it is taking place? DCS Keith Niven: I cannot answer on behalf of the Home Ofce. This has come from the Home Ofce, which is a statement opposing female genital mutilation, which is a booklet we have, so there is some work going forward with that. However, I am not aware of the Home Ofce specically making visits. They may have; I do not know. It has not been something that has been brought back to the attention of the police, but that work may be ongoing with the Foreign and Commonwealth Ofce and the Home Ofce. I am unable to clarify. Efua Dorkenoo: The Home Ofce, last year, went over to Ethiopia and had an education meeting for all the ofcers in Africa around genital mutilation, and they have come out with this statement on the legal status of FGM in the UK which will help young people if they are old enough to take it with them when they go abroad. What might be much more concrete would be to make sure that when people get visas to come here, they are given some tangible information that FGM is illegal in the UK, and there are the ramications around it. Whatever we discuss comes back to the fact that in this country we have a series of activities on FGM .. We do not have a comprehensive strategy with a national action plan, where each Department group agrees that this is what needs to be done, and monitor its implementation. I wanted to add that there are three reviews coming up, which may provide the UK the opportunity to come out with this comprehensive plan to address allthe different barriers. One review is to do with the DPP Taskforce looking at the barriers to prosecution. A second is a group of funding bodies\u2014the Rosa fund, Esm\u00e9e Fairbairn Foundation, and the Trust for London\u2014who have been supporting more than 20 groups around the country, working with communities doing a major review of where the community actions are. That is also coming up and it will be ready in the summer. Finally, the Home Ofce had a multi-agency guideline, which it sends to professionals. It is not statutory. It ought to be statutory, but they are doing a review of how far frontline professionals are actually engaging with the issue. That review should be out very soon. If we get all these reviews, I think under the auspices of the Home Ofce we should all sit down, look at where we are with the issue, and what are the key things that health or education needs to step up on FGM. I have been to a lot of these policy meetings, and education is never there, but FGM is mainly safeguarding Issue. We need to bring all the different departments together and then look at the information we have and agree on a comprehensive strategy and an action plan that we can follow, with the indicators to see how things have been actually addressed on the ground level. That is what I think needs to be done. Q67 Chair: Thank you very much. I think you have got the flavour of the questions. We cannot as a country say that this is a practice around the world that we wish to take a lead in eliminating if we are not vigorously addressing it at home, and indeed for British citizens abroad who are at risk. You have helped us focus our attention on that. Superintendent Niven, certainly in your evidence you have made it clear that you are focused on it, but in terms of the ordinary, if I may say it, police ofcer going about his duty, you would only have to go back a generation with a comment about domestic violence to nd the general reply was, \"Oh, it is just a domestic.\" We now do not accept that. I suppose the point I am making is that we need to take the same view about this. Ordinary police ofcers, not specialists, need to be aware that this is a practice\u2014particularly in the communities where the girls are at risk\u2014and that they need to be vigorous. Perhaps that is where you will get the prosecutions, because if they are switched on, they may be more focussed on getting the evidence. Women complain generally that we do not get enough prosecutions for rape, that domestic violence is not taken seriously enough, and obviously with an issue like this the reply is, \"Oh, it is a cultural issue we should not interfere with,\" and yet they all come together. A point that was made to me in terms of general awareness was that in societies where violence against women is prevalent\u2014and it exists in all societies, but it is worse in more\u2014the more prevalent it is, the more prone those societies are to conflict and violence in general. This is not just an issue about standing up for the rights of women, who by denition are not a minority. They are the majority. It is about creating aInternational Development Committee: Evidence Ev 21 12 February 2013 Detective Chief Superintendent Keith Niven, Detective Chief Inspector Iqbal Singh, Efua Dorkenoo OBE and Nimco Ali functioning society, and it is a job for men as well as for women. This Committee is dominated by men\u2014 Fiona O'Donnell: In numbers. Chair: But I am glad to say we have three very effective women on the Committee. It is important to make the point that this is one that women and men need to address together. Again, in the communities you are talking about, it seems to me that rst of all the women who are sending their daughters are effectively doing it to please the men. They have to also be part of the process, and the men also have to be educated to say, \"This is not the way to treat women.\" It is a very big task across all kinds of different levels. Can I say thank you for your evidence? Can I also say, because obviously you are working on this, if there is anything that you feel you want to feed in on reflection, or additional information or additional comment or statistics\u2014anything you feel will help us\u2014we would appreciate it? Chlo\u00eb obviously is working for us on the Report. You have given us an awful lot of insight, but if you can think of more, please write to us, and I am sure if Chlo\u00eb has anymore questions, she might come back to you. On behalf of the Committee, I am sorry we have diminished in number, but that is what happens as the hearings go on. We genuinely appreciate your coming in, and I hope you appreciate it is really important to get an input from the police and the opportunity to have both of you together\u2014in fact you work together anyway, but it is still helpful. DCS Keith Niven: This is child abuse. That is what it is. That is exactly what it is. Q68 Chair: It is, and it may indeed be easier to prosecute as that than under a specic law on FGM. DCS Keith Niven: Yes, absolutely. Chair: The important thing is, we need prosecutions in order to help the educational process of communicating that this is wrong\u2014it should not be happening. Efua Dorkenoo: Yes. DCS Keith Niven: Yes. Chair: I hope it will not be too long before you have success. Thank you very much indeed.Ev 22 International Development Committee: Evidence Tuesday 12 March 2013 Members present: Sir Malcolm Bruce (Chair) Hugh Bayley Fiona Bruce Richard Burden Fabian Hamilton Pauline Latham ________________ Examination of Witnesses Witnesses: Sir John Holmes , Co-Chair, International Rescue Committee UK, and Director, Ditchley Foundation, Chitra Nagarajan , Director, Gender Action for Peace and Security, and Kerry Smith , Head of Advocacy and Campaigns, Plan UK, gave evidence. Q69 Chair: Good morning, and welcome to our Committee. Thank you all very much for agreeing to come in and help us with our inquiry. I think you know we spent a couple of weeks in Ethiopia, coming back last week, looking at aspects of violence against women and girls\u2014not exclusively, but it was a signicant part. You will not be surprised to hear Members making some allusions to that. For the record, could you introduce yourselves? Sir John Holmes: My name is John Holmes. I was for many years a British diplomat, but after that I was the Emergency Relief Co-ordinator for the UN from 2007 to 2010. I am now the Co-Chair of the International Rescue Committee in the UK and also Director of something called the Ditchley Foundation. Chair: Which I am familiar with. Chitra Nagarajan: Good morning. My name is Chitra Nagarajan. I am the Director of Gender Action for Peace and Security. Kerry Smith: Good morning. My name is Kerry Smith. I am the Head of Advocacy at Plan UK. Prior to that I worked with the International Committee of the Red Cross and also Save the Children, in conflict and humanitarian situations. Q70 Chair: Obviously we as a Committee have taken the view that the issue of gender across the piece, and violence against women and girls, is absolutely central to the issues of development. We are looking for both the international community and our own Government to take strong initiatives to tackle it. I wondered if you perhaps would give us your views on how you think the Government's approach is working, given that it is cross-departmental, and, perhaps more specically, what you think DFID's role should be, and indeed whether they are fullling it well enough, or could do more, better or do it differently. I do not know who wants to take it rst. Sir John Holmes: We have been working at IRC with DFID for quite some time on this issue, including lots of discussion with them in retreats at Ditchley, as it happens, about this, with a particular focus on violence against women and girls in humanitarian emergencies, rather than a development context. We thought that was something that was not being focussed on enough by DFID, but not only by DFID. We think they have come a long way in recognisingJeremy Lefroy Mr Michael McCann Fiona O'Donnell Chris White the need to recognise the phenomenon of violence against women and girls at the outset of humanitarian emergencies. We need to recognise that it is virtually always there\u2014in fact it is always there in one way or another, even in natural disasters, but obviously particularly in conflicts\u2014and therefore needs to be treated as something that needs to be dealt with right at the beginning of a new disaster or a new conflict. We should do this without necessarily waiting for evidence that it is there, because the evidence we have from previous conflicts is that it will be there. We also need to treat it as something that is life-saving and therefore fundamental to the humanitarian response, and not something that is an add-on later. That is the kind of discussion we have been having with them. As I say, we think they have come a long way to accept the need to do that. The evidence obviously very recently from the Secretary of State is a speech she gave about a week ago recognising that this was a major issue, promoting an international call to action for prioritising violence against women and girls in humanitarian emergencies, and indeed calling for a summit this autumn about that, which we think is extremely welcome. Obviously the issue is that it is not a question of one decision or one speech that makes the difference. You have to spread that message throughout the Department, a Department like DFID, which takes time, and you need to integrate it into everything they are doing, so it is prioritised in their funding decisions and in their relationships with the organisations they are funding\u2014UN agencies, NGOs, the Red Cross, whoever it might be. There needs to be some tracking of what they are doing to address this issue of violence against women and girls in humanitarian emergencies, and staff must be properly trained to recognise the symptoms and to deal with it, and have the right kind of guidance about what to do about it and what is needed in these cases. That takes a long time to work through a system, and we are committed, as others are, to working with DFID to make sure that happens and that it is followed through, and is not just rhetoric but translates into reality on the ground. Chitra Nagarajan: We are also very pleased to see DFID's increasing commitment to tackling violence against women and girls overseas, as evidenced by the Secretary of State's speech that Sir John referred toInternational Development Committee: Evidence Ev 23 12 March 2013 Sir John Holmes, Chitra Nagarajan and Kerry Smith earlier. However, there are a number of areas where we feel that DFID needs to be stronger and take rmer action, including when it comes to cross-governmental working. We believe that more of DFID's funding should be targeted towards tackling the root causes of violence against women and girls, and directly address women's empowerment. On the funding point that Sir John made, we also think that there should be a review of the funding mechanisms. For example, the OECD DAC recently did a survey of all its funding to gender equality, and found that only 1.3% of all funding specically to gender equality goes to women's rights organisations and women's ministries. Now the evidence is that it is actually the mobilisation of women's rights organisations that causes policy change, we feel that funding should reflect that. Also we believe that DFID should use its position more when working with the FCO and the Ministry of Defence when it comes to cross-governmental working. Furthermore, nally I would like to make a point that we are a bit worried that there seems to be a collapsing of the violence against women and girls agenda and the women, peace and security agenda. I like to think of these as a Venn diagram, so obviously violence against women and girls happens in conflict but also across the spectrum of countries, and women, peace and security is broader than just violence against women and also includes women's participation and empowerment, as well as ensuring that there are gender-sensitive relief, recovery and transitional processes. We are a bit worried that whenever we talk to DFID about what they are doing on women, peace and security, they tell us what they are doing on violence against women and girls, so we would like to see, as I said before, more work being done looking specically at women's participation and empowerment as well as violence. Q71 Chair: I will ask Kerry Smith, but I have perhaps an added question on the way. For example, when we did our Report on Afghanistan, we highlighted the issue of women and girls in general, saying that the progress that women had made was, if you like, the best justication for intervention, and that what happened after 2015 to women and girls would be the best measure of continuity. When we asked DFID, they said, \"It is all mainstreamed,\" but we could not nd any particular programmes. I suppose what I am looking for is the extent to which they really need to bring out and highlight what they are doing specically, and ensure that it is built into the process, rather than when they are asked afterwards, saying \"Oh, it was all built into the programme,\" but you cannot nd the references. Would that be a valid criticism of, or a valid recommendation to, DFID? Kerry Smith: I think that is a valid recommendation. Plan is currently conducting a review of girls in disasters: what is happening to support girls and their needs in disasters, and what their needs are. Obviously violence against girls is a key concern for us. One of the things we are most worried about is the invisibility of girls in disasters. DFID has done a lot of work in prioritising violence-against-girls work on the onehand, and also girls' education on the other, and what we would like to see is the integration of these approaches, which would lead to that kind of practical action. In part of our research we have also looked at Afghanistan, and if you look at the 103 projects that we analysed, covering food, health, water, sanitation, shelter, NFIs, education and protection, only 10 projects were classied as having a principal purpose of advancing gender equality under the Gender Marker scheme of the Inter-agency Standing Committee. Given that we all recognise that gender equality and women's rights is a key issue in Afghanistan, that is quite startling. Indeed seven of those were focussed on nutrition and the health sector, so it would seem that ensuring that mothers could feed their children properly was part of that advancement of gender equality\u2014which it is, but not really. There are different ways of doing that. What you highlight is true: when it gets down to the monitoring level of what projects are delivering on the ground, and how you influence those, there are some recommendations to be made about taking forward greater investment, but potentially also greater clarity on the part of donors like DFID to say, \"These are the standards we require.\" That would be an interesting recommendation. Q72 Pauline Latham: As a supplementary to that, you have talked about women in conflict, but what about women post-conflict in the peace process, trying to build peace and trying to provide stability in a country? Do you think women are involved enough in that process? Kerry Smith: I will let my colleague from Gender Action for Peace and Security answer that one. Chitra Nagarajan: Thank you. The short answer is no, unfortunately. 1325, the Security Council Resolution that rst talked about women, peace and security, was passed in 2000, but 13 years after that we still see women marginalised from peace and transition discussions. In the last 20 years, only 16% of peace agreements have mentioned the word \"women\", and a lot of times when women are mentioned it is to restrict women's rights. Only one in 40 signatories to peace agreements are women, or 2.5%, which is woefully low. Unfortunately, as we are talking about DFID and the UK, the UK is not doing enough to ensure that women are included in peace and transition discussions. For example, the UK Government hosted a conference on Somalia last year, in February. At that conference there was only one woman from Somalia present. We are hoping that when the UK hosts the conference on Somalia again this year in May, this will be signicantly better. We were talking about Afghanistan earlier, and I think there has been a lot said about how women in Afghanistan are marginalised from the discussions happening there, so even though nine out of 70 members of the High Peace Council are women, the information we are getting is that these women are completely sidelined in discussions. When we are talking about representation and participation, it is good to have the numbers there, but participation and representation needs to beEv 24 International Development Committee: Evidence 12 March 2013 Sir John Holmes, Chitra Nagarajan and Kerry Smith meaningful. This is what I was talking about earlier when I was saying that DFID needs to do more to look at women's participation, women's empowerment and women's leadership, not just at the international level but also at the national and community levels as well. Q73 Fiona Bruce: Good morning, everyone. Sir John, you mentioned the Secretary of State's recent speech, and the call to action internationally on violence against women and girls in humanitarian emergencies. You have all mentioned some steps that could be taken. Could I ask you all very briefly just to highlight what you think would be perhaps a single action that DFID could take to meet its stated objectives\u2014to up its game assisting women in emergencies? What would be that single action you would like to see? Sir John Holmes: It is always difcult to identify just one action. I think it is important when you are trying to deal with this that you mainstream it through other parts of the response agenda, so when you are designing shelter responses or food distributions, you factor in this idea of preventing, mitigating or reducing violence against women and girls, and then you need to have very specic responses as well. These are about providing services after women and girls have been subject to violence, in terms of preventing rape and HIV , and psychosocial therapy. You need the mixture of both. It is not a choice; it is very much the spectrum of those things. If there was one single thing that DFID should do, apart from making sure that all the people who work for DFID are aware of this as a priority, it is to insist, when they are dealing with UN agencies, NGOs and so on in their funding decisions, that they will not fund unless this is a priority in their programmes\u2014if it is appropriate, obviously, for that particular context\u2014and there is reporting on what these organisations have done. On particular situations or annually, there should be reporting on what they have done to address this. That then starts to get the message through to the whole system, and would begin to make the real difference they want to see. Chitra Nagarajan: I would agree with Sir John completely. It has been well documented that violence against women and girls always happens in emergencies but, despite that, funding is still far from adequate. That is one area in which DFID can contribute. Also I would recommend that they do more to adhere to, and make sure their partners adhere to, the IASC guidelines on addressing GBV in emergencies as well. I would just echo Sir John's points. Kerry Smith: I would agree with my colleagues. I think there is real value in DFID taking a leading role. They have already announced they will hold a humanitarian summit, and hopefully that will build on the Foreign Secretary's work at the G8 on preventing sexual violence in conflict. What we would like to see is a real commitment from them, saying, \"Along with those shelter, health and food specialists on that rst plane, there will also be gender-based violence specialists and child protection specialists. We value it at that level; we see it as a life-saving intervention.\" That message coming from DFID, as such asignicant donor in the humanitarian setting, would be very useful. In terms of looking at the systems, Sir John has already suggested a few in terms of internally looking at training as well as making that kind of funding commitment to tackling violence against women and girls very evident in the way in which it will fund other agencies. However, there are also things like returning to the Inter-agency Standing Committee's Gender Marker, and particularly from girls' perspective, incorporating age into that marker. Girls do not always benet from services that are addressed to women. Girls need different kinds of services and do not necessarily access those sexual and reproductive health services or the gender-based violence services that are aimed purely at women. Incorporating an age component into the Gender Marker would be a very good step. Q74 Fiona Bruce: Again, briefly, why do you think the life-saving measures for women and girls in humanitarian settings are currently under-prioritised and scarcely funded, and how far do you see UN relief agencies providing those services at present? Sir John Holmes: There are two main reasons why it does not have the priority we think it should have. Firstly, when there is a new disaster and a new emergency, the automatic response has always been, \"Let's get the basics right rst. Let's make sure there is food, clean water and healthcare, and so on, and then we will think about the other stuff later.\" It is an understandable response, but we have learned over time that that does not really work, because you make too many mistakes at the beginning in how you design these things. That is why you need, as Kerry said, these experts on the rst plane, and these projects and programmes in the rst design of the response, rather than as something that comes along later. Often, when it comes to mainstreaming these concerns into what you do about shelter, where you put the latrines, how you organise food distribution and how you do rewood collection and so on, it is too late; you have already made the decisions. That is one thing we need to overcome: that instinctive response of, \"Let's get the basics right rst; let's get all the usual stuff on the planes, and then we will sort the rest out later.\" I think the second reason is, again, a very understandable response: \"Before we put money or effort into this, or send the people out, we need to have some evidence that it is really happening. When we have some prevalence data about the number of women reporting rape, and the number of women reporting sexual violence or other harassment, or problems about collecting rewood, or whatever it might be, then we will nd a response, and then we will do it.\" Of course that data either comes in very late, or sometimes does not come in at all in any meaningful way, because of the difculties women have in reporting it. It is a vicious circle. If there are no services available for the survivors of sexual violence, why would they go and report it to somebody, when they put themselves at risk by doing that, either with the authorities or with their own families or communities?International Development Committee: Evidence Ev 25 12 March 2013 Sir John Holmes, Chitra Nagarajan and Kerry Smith That is why we say you need to build it in. Assume that it is happening, because we know it will be; build in those responses, and do not wait for the data. There is still an instinct to say, \"There is no evidence of this,\" or, \"Other organisations are not reporting this.\" We need to get over that hurdle and decide that we need to do it, on the basis that we know it is happening. Q75 Chris White: Good morning. May I ask what you think are the most effective ways in which DFID can influence UN agencies to improve their efforts to address violence against women and girls in humanitarian and conflict-affected settings? Kerry Smith: Certainly. One of the ways we have touched on before is to look at those funding mechanisms: prioritising violence against women and girls in the funding they grant to agencies, and asking for reporting back on it. The Gender Marker of the Inter-agency Standing Committee is a useful tool, but it only really monitors the projects on paper, so there is not really any monitoring coming back on what is being delivered on the ground. It is an interesting system for all of us, isn't it, when we are managing people. Strategically, however, you can use those board meetings. Convene with other donors like the US and Sweden before you go to the board meetings of Unicef or UNHCR, and agree amongst yourselves that you will focus on humanitarian settings in those board meetings as well as focus on violence against women and girls, and you will deliver that message at the very highest level\u2014 that this is a priority for you as members of the board and as key donor agencies. There is a lot of strategic work that can be done at that level. Sir John Holmes: Can I just add to that? I worked at a UN agency that was obviously funded by donors like DFID, and agencies listen to donors. It is an obvious point, but he who pays the piper calls the tune. If donors come and say to an agency, \"This is what we want you to do,\" and implicitly or explicitly say, \"and if you do not do it, you will not get as much money as you did before,\" that works. Chitra Nagarajan: I would agree with that. DFID should use its influence more to make sure that violence against women and girls is included as a criterion in annual reporting of partners, and make it clearer that DFID expects to see how, and the extent to which, the UN agencies are prioritising tackling violence against women and girls. Q76 Chris White: I am glad to hear your level of condence, Sir John. How do you think DFID could ensure peacekeepers are better trained in regards to gender issues? Sir John Holmes: The same thing tends to apply. The UK, for example, is a major contributor to the budget of peacekeeping forces\u2014disproportionately, compared with other UN members, because of the way the system works. They need to make sure that in all the discussions that are had, in the Security Council but also in the various Committees of the UN that look at the way peacekeeping works, protection of civilians as a general point, but also protection of the most vulnerable, particularly women and girls, isagain included in the basic instructions for the way peacekeeping forces work. When I was at OCHA, we did a lot of work with the DPKO, the Department in the UN for peacekeeping, to try to make sure that the training the peacekeepers got covered things like protection of civilians. That is not just about physical protection of civilians, but about an attitude and a way that they deal with them. It is a difcult problem, because the contingents that go into peacekeeping forces are ordinary military contingents from countries like Pakistan or wherever they might be. This is completely different and alien work for them. They only stay six months, so you have to keep on repeating it. It is quite a big problem to get that sort of attitude built in. It will not work unless you train the commanders of those forces rst of all, and then they spread that attitude downwards. It is a big task, it is a constant task, it is an uphill task, but that is the only way you can do it\u2014by pushing it through so that they take it seriously. Then again you are looking, when the peacekeeping forces report on what is happening, as they have to do every six months to the Security Council, to see what they are saying about this, what they are doing about this, and whether the situation is improving. Q77 Chris White: As you know, DFID has its 2011 Multilateral Aid Review this year. Which agencies in particular should be assessed on their commitment to addressing violence against women and girls? Sir John Holmes: The obvious answer is they all should be. Chris White: Any in particular? Sir John Holmes: For humanitarian emergencies, obviously, you need to focus on UNHCR, the World Food Programme and Unicef. They are the three biggest working in that area, but of course there are others, like the UN Population Fund, that have some specialised services in there. It should be something that is pretty much across the board, because even those who are not working in emergencies are working in development settings, UNDP and so on. This is, as Chitra said, a spectrum, so we do not want to totally focus on violence against women and girls in humanitarian emergencies and neglect the wider issues of women's empowerment and protection. Q78 Pauline Latham: If I could just go back to the peacekeeping at the UN, you said that he who pays the piper calls the tune. That is not correct in the DRC. We asked the question, \"Why don't the UN peacekeepers hold on to the men they know have raped the women until the police get there?\" We were told, \"Oh, they cannot do that. That is not in their mandate.\" These women are being raped and abused regularly, even murdered, and the UN people know who the perpetrators are but they are not allowed to hold on to them until anybody comes to arrest them, because that would be seen as being on one side or another. It is not accurate to say that we pay a lot of money and therefore we should dictate, because nobody listens. We have asked that question. Sir John Holmes: I was not saying they necessarily do it very well. I was just saying that we could make that effort. It is a big uphill struggle. The question ofEv 26 International Development Committee: Evidence 12 March 2013 Sir John Holmes, Chitra Nagarajan and Kerry Smith the UN peacekeeping force in the DRC, and how well they do or do not do in protecting civilians and particularly women, is a huge issue. There is a very technical point to which you are alluding, which is that their mandate is not to act as police forces, and that prevents them from doing certain things. However, even if you accept that point, and maybe it can be challenged, there is a lot they can do by making sure they are in the right places at the right times to try to stop that violence happening in the rst place. The point is always made, and it is correct, that they are a big peacekeeping force but it is a much bigger territory, so they will not be behind every bush and in every village and able to stop every incident. As I say, it is also a question of how they go about their task, how they liaise with local communities, how they understand what is happening there, and how they try to work out where they need to be and what the intelligence they have is. In all those areas, frankly, they are pretty weak, for some of the reasons I was giving\u2014because they are just not naturally the kind of people who will do that very well. That is why we need to not expect too much of them, try to make sure they are trained as well as they can be, and then we have to tackle the problem of sexual violence in the DRC by all sorts of other methods as well. You have said that they could hold them until the police came, but the police force in the Eastern DRC\u2014 Q79 Pauline Latham: They are some of the perpetrators. I accept that. Sir John Holmes: Effectively, there are no prisons, no judges, and no police. Expecting the justice system to do its work is a very big challenge. Q80 Chris White: Sorry, did you say we should not expect too much of them? Sir John Holmes: What I mean by that, and I did spend quite a lot of time in DRC and a lot of time talking to people like those in that peacekeeping force, is that if you expect them to prevent every incident, and if you hold them to that standard, they will always miss it by absolutely miles. Even if there are 20,000 in a country the size of Europe, as it were, there are great limits on what they will do. Adjust your expectations; focus on what they can do, and what they should be doing. I do not mean you should set their aspirations lower than is right, but do not set the expectation so high that you are setting them up to fail before they even start. That is what I mean. Chitra Nagarajan: I would like to add two further points to the comments made by Sir John. I think what is key here is that peacekeepers consult with women in communities about where the threats against them come from, to then make sure that their work is acting in reaction to the threats against the whole population. The second point is around the accountabilities of peacekeepers themselves who commit sexual violence and are involved in sexual exploitation and abuse. Of course this is a very tricky area, but the US is doing some work around this, and the UK should be supporting the work of its American counterparts in tackling this. Sir John Holmes: One other point to make is that there was a very successful case\u2014I do not think itwas in DRC, but somebody may remember\u2014where there was a female contingent of peacekeepers. I think they were from Bangladesh. Chitra Nagarajan: Liberia. Sir John Holmes: Liberia? They could do things, and understood things, that male contingents did not understand. That made a big difference, but unfortunately it has not been generalised in the way I think it could be. Chitra Nagarajan: Yes. I worked in Liberia for a while, and it was very interesting talking with women's rights organisations in Liberia about their ideas about the all-female contingent. They could not only do things men could not; women felt more able to come and talk to them about threats to their personal security. Also, they did not view them as a threat, and felt safer walking when there were women peacekeepers there. Kerry Smith: Could I just build on that point with one little point in terms of this idea of all-women contingents of peacekeepers, which I think is a very interesting point and one that we need to take forward, but also this element of looking at the wide spectrum of violence? For example, for girls the journey to and from school is a real key concern for them and for their parents. Parents often withdraw them because they are worried about the violence they will be subjected to on that school journey. Even the simple effort of peacekeepers patrolling more often during those times, during those journeys, would provide quite a useful protective environment. It is those small steps\u2014not changing the whole structure but those small steps. The other point in terms of training, which ties in with the all-women peacekeeper contingent element, is the idea of having those civilian experts very well embedded in the operational side of the peacekeeping operation. They should not be set aside as a particular civilian expert and go off and do their own thing, but be included in those kind of operational discussions and decisions at that very senior level. We have seen that that can work, for example, with child protection resources in DPKO in Sudan. It is worth exploring that as well. Chitra Nagarajan: Another effect of having women peacekeepers\u2014who in this case were actually from India not Bangladesh\u2014 Sir John Holmes: Sorry. Chitra Nagarajan: \u2014is on women living in communities. The women I spoke with in Liberia were saying that for them they saw a lot more women joining the Liberian police force, because they saw this as something that women could do. Q81 Richard Burden: I would like to ask you a couple of questions, if I may, about trying to combat violence against women and girls in refugee situations, and in particular in organised camps. It is always dangerous to generalise too much from a specic example, but last week we were in Ethiopia and the Sherkole camp, where there are 10,000 refugees. The vast majority come from Sudan, but there are some\u2014and Fiona Bruce and I met a particular family involved here\u2014who have come from the Great Lakes region. They had travelled across Uganda, Kenya and had ended up a long way away inInternational Development Committee: Evidence Ev 27 12 March 2013 Sir John Holmes, Chitra Nagarajan and Kerry Smith Ethiopia, and their story was typical: of multiple rapes and so on. IRC are clearly doing some really good work in that camp, creating safe space for women and for girls, but also, when we spoke to this family from the Great Lakes, it seemed that they felt fairly separate from that. That is not a criticism particularly, but generally in those kind of multinational, multi-ethnic situations, in terms of the refugees, is there any best practice to ensure the services and initiatives that are taken reach both, if you like, the mainstream\u2014in that case, the Sudanese\u2014and also other nationalities that may congregate in those camps? Sir John Holmes: It is a very good point. Many camps are fairly uniform in the kind of people who are there, but there are plenty that are not, for the kinds of reasons you give. It is obviously crucial to ensure that the same services are available to everybody, and that the services are targeted at the particular needs of the different communities. I think what you are suggesting is that what may have been okay for the Sudanese refugees was not appropriate, perhaps, for this family from the Great Lakes. Is that what you mean? Or did they not feel comfortable with the others? Q82 Richard Burden: No, it was not so much that. It was more that it was almost a bit irrelevant to them. They did not even mention this project was there, and we were asking them if they were getting any support. I suppose what I am getting at there, and this is my second question, is about how NGOs operating in this eld interact with the management of camps, and whether there are any particular examples of good practice or where improvement is needed in particular situations, whether they are operated by UNHCR or particular countries and so on. To give an example on that, if you look at the Syrian refugee crisis, there are very different models of how camps are run between, say, Turkey, where they have very much kicked UNHCR out and it is the Turkish Government that runs them, and Jordan, where it is a much more hands-on, UNHCR-run operation. I suppose what I am getting at is whether there is anything about the management of camps, or the approaches to that, that can increase the reach and effectiveness around violence against women and girls. Sir John Holmes: The management of camps is absolutely crucial in reducing the risk of violence against women and girls when people are in the camps, as well as treating them for whatever may have happened to them before they got to the camps. We have to have both of those things in mind. As I was suggesting at the beginning, the design of a camp is very important for reducing these risks. It is about where the latrines are, whether they have locks, whether there is lighting, whether there are patrols, where they get the rewood from and whether the stoves are fuel-efcient so they do not need to collect more rewood, which is often the point of maximum danger. Those design points are absolutely crucial, and part of the camp management. There is good practice; there is plenty of guidance around about camps. Does it always work well?Obviously it is very variable, and the management is very variable. UNHCR often runs camps; NGOs sometimes run camps, and are given the task of camp management. I think the key is, from my experience visiting lots of these places, working with all the organisations that are working in that camp with a kind of camp committee, and that camp committee, as it were, also incorporating the people in the camp themselves, so it is not just something being done to them, but something they are helping to design for themselves. That is not so easy to do right at the beginning when people are pouring in and so on, but it is something you can get right over time, because unfortunately many of these camps are there for a very long time. If you design the overall structure right, then the context for women and girls will also be much better, but then you still have to have the specic services we have been talking about: the safe spaces, the dignity kits, the survival care that may be needed to make sure that does not happen. Of course the security in the camp needs to be right as well, and that can be provided in different ways. There are plenty of ways of doing this. One nal point\u2014sorry, I am going on too long\u2014is about, for example, the Syria case. Most of the refugees from Syria are not in camps. They are in urban settings, particularly in Jordan; probably 80% in Jordan, and almost 100% in Lebanon, are not in camps. Most in the Turkish area are. Again, there are very different contexts, but you still need to be providing services in all those contexts that people can know about and access. Kerry Smith: I would just add two things to emphasise what Sir John has said. There are standards, and I suppose the question is how you really ensure accountability for those standards. As a donor, a UN agency or an NGO, will you say to your staff and those who are delivering on the ground, \"You will be measured against these particular standards, and we will want reporting back on them\"? That is a key issue. What are we going to say we want the UK Government to put out there, as that key message around accountability? The second issue to emphasise again is that voice concern. Adolescent girls, especially, are really invisible in emergencies. Their families hide them to protect them, but also because they want them to do the childcare, look for food and potentially do paid work. We need to look at camp management in a way that also provides secure places for girls and women to talk about the issues, the interventions and the services they want. That is as true in a camp situation as it is in a host community situation. In host communities girls are even further buried. There are denitely interventions we can make to engage with communities and their families and ensure that all those affected by emergencies are getting the services they need. I will just make one more reflection. When you spoke about the family from the Great Lakes, what that sparked in me is that consideration that it is all of our duties. NGOs also have a duty to deliver better on the ground with regard to violence against women and girls, but also on issues like disability. Girls who areEv 28 International Development Committee: Evidence 12 March 2013 Sir John Holmes, Chitra Nagarajan and Kerry Smith disabled are twice as likely to suffer sexual violence as girls who are non-disabled. This is another concern we have not got to the bottom of, and highlighting those problems of multiple discriminations or multiple vulnerabilities is really important. Chitra Nagarajan: I would just like to add another point on that as well. I believe we need to do more to understand the intersecting sites of oppression, as well, linked to Kerry's point. We cannot assume that the existing work on violence against women and girls will address the needs of, for example, migrant women, lesbian women, disabled women and trans women. We need to look both in terms of ensuring access to women who are further marginalised by double or triple forms of oppression, and making sure that our existing programming reflects their needs and perspectives as well. Kerry mentioned that disabled women and girls are twice as likely to experience violence than the general population. One in seven women and girls are disabled, but there is very little research or programming that expressly targets this. We need to be better at making sure that when we talk about violence against women and girls, we are talking about violence against all women and girls. Q83 Mr McCann: Could I ask each of you what your views are on the Foreign Secretary's Preventing Sexual Violence initiative, and in particular what you feel it has achieved, and if you have any reflections on how it could be improved? Sir John Holmes: Firstly, we warmly welcome it. It is a very good initiative. It is early days to talk about what it has achieved, because it is very much something that is, I think, part of the G8 Presidency and hopefully will feed through into what is happening in the G8 and the consciousness of other Governments in the G8 that they should be doing similar things. By the way, it is not only in the G8: I think it should be spread into the G20, which is a much more appropriate group, in some ways, for it to reach. We welcome it. We want to see it making a real difference on the ground and not just being a rhetorical commitment, and as I understand it there is a real commitment in the Foreign Ofce to making sure that happens by sending out, for example, the team that will go out to DRC and other places. If there is a concern, it is that we do not focus exclusively on what they are prioritising, which is prevention and the reduction of impunity. Those are extremely important things, and of course if you can prevent the phenomenon in the rst place, that is the best way of dealing with it. However, for example, in a place like DRC, as we were saying earlier, preventing it has been our objective for 20 years and we have made very little progress, if we are truthful about it, and probably will not until the overall conflict stops. The impunity point is absolutely crucial, because again it is extremely difcult to tackle in an area where there is very little infrastructure of any kind. Even if you lock people up, they have to let them out because there is no food for them in the prison. It is that sort of basic problem that you are dealing with.I am not saying that is not a good thing to focus on, but we need to make sure that there is also a focus on the response side of it\u2014the services available for victims of sexual violence afterwards\u2014and all the measures we have been talking about to make sure that whatever we are doing includes the threat to women and girls. Chitra Nagarajan: We also very much welcome the prioritisation by the Foreign Secretary of the issue of sexual violence in conflict, and although it is too early to tell, I think we can see some indications of the impact it is having already. For example, I do not know if any of you have read the recent case of the woman in Somalia who was imprisoned because she accused the security forces of rape. They imprisoned her for insulting the security forces. I know this was raised with the Somali Prime Minister by the UK Prime Minister and also by the Foreign Secretary, and as a result of international pressure, that woman has now been released from prison, so it is already having some impact. However, although Ministers have stated that DFID has an important role to play in the initiative, we are still yet to see exactly what that role is. There are areas in which DFID should be supporting the FCO, and three key areas for us are ensuring that all the support it gives to security and justice sector reform is gender-sensitive, ensuring that support is given to women's rights organisations or women's human rights defenders around this, and also funding for survivor services. We nd that although women's rights organisations and women's human rights defenders are key agents for change, as I mentioned before, in preventing and responding to violence against women, they are completely sidelined and marginalised. This is not just when it comes to funding, but when it also comes to looking at protection against attacks against them. Women's human rights defenders are subject to attacks, and the attacks on them are increasing internationally, but yet very little is being done to act proactively and reactively to this. We are very happy to see that this is something that the FCO and Foreign Secretary will be pushing at the G8 in April at the Foreign Ministers' Meeting, but we strongly believe that this needs to be accompanied by DFID support as well. Although DFID is scaling up its programming dealing with violence against women and girls, there needs to be more consideration of how to mitigate the backlash that will inevitably occur against women's rights organisations and women activists, and build that into all stages of DFID programming work. Kerry Smith: Can I just add two quick points? What it has achieved is a real UK Government vision. We are the champions globally of violence against women and girls, and that is not to be sniffed at. That is something quite powerful. We hope that will see some results in the Foreign Ministers' Meeting in April and lead into some signicant commitments by donor colleagues in the humanitarian summit in the autumn. Also, the Foreign Ofce, alongside DFID, have done quite a lot of consultation of civil society experts on this initiative, and they have opened up their vision. They have opened it up to include the important issueInternational Development Committee: Evidence Ev 29 12 March 2013 Sir John Holmes, Chitra Nagarajan and Kerry Smith of sexual violence against girls and boys, and also to look at that conundrum of services. The Foreign Ofce is there to look at the human rights angle and the diplomatic angle. They are not there necessarily to provide the services on the ground, but they realise that you will not get the prosecutions or address impunity if you do not have services that women can go to get their health looked after or to be accompanied along that very long road to justice. Those are all good things. Where it could always do with improvement is in the strengthening of the understanding of how services relate to justice, and also how they are of value in and of themselves. Obviously we have not yet seen what the humanitarian summit will bring, or what its agenda is, but that is really the future of this particular initiative. Q84 Mr McCann: My next question was going to be: do you think there is a risk in isolating sexual violence in conflict from all the other problems? I think you have all partially answered that, but in terms of the particular point you have just made, Kerry, do you not think there is a huge danger? You have just said it yourself in your own words: \"The Foreign Ofce only do this, and it is not connecting up with all the different parts of the problem we have to deal with.\" Therefore, it goes back to the heart of the problem: is it wise to set up a separate initiative dealing with only one part of the problem, rather than taking a holistic approach? Kerry Smith: Is it wise, or is it practical? You come away from principle into practicality, and I feel that sometimes you just have to take specic problems, really highlight them, and ensure that you are making those links into that delivery on the ground. Q85 Mr McCann: You have just said they do not deliver on the ground. Kerry Smith: No, they do not deliver on the ground, but they need to make the links into the agencies that do, so if they are putting experts into DRC, which they are doing, they need to make those links with those organisations, national and international, who are delivering on the ground the health responses, improving-justice responses and capacity building. They are aware that they need to link into what is already there. I suppose it is whether we take the opportunity of saying, \"This is at least being highlighted at the G8.\" I agree it needs to go to the G20. Is that something we can take it to, and can we get that donor and funding commitment from a humanitarian summit of the G8, including the G20, to make sure that there is actual impact on the ground in terms of delivering services for women and girls who have been victims of sexual violence, but also in terms of going along that road to preventing it as well? Chitra Nagarajan: I would also hope that what this initiative does is raise the prole of women, peace and security across the board as well, so that we are not looking at just one part of the agenda, which is tackling violence against women and girls\u2014actually only a very small part of that agenda, which is specically sexual violence in conflict\u2014but also looking at the women's participation, empowermentand leadership that I mentioned earlier. This year is a very important year, in that not only do we have the G8 in April, we have CSW\u2014the Commission on the Status of Women\u2014going on now, but also the National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security is being evaluated this year, with an idea of developing a new National Action Plan to run from 2014 to 2016. The UK was one of the rst countries to develop a National Action Plan, and has really been leading the agenda when it comes to women, peace and security, but the NAP still remains siloed and not integrated into wider conflict prevention and response strategy. For example, I would like to see more work being done on the Building Stability Overseas Strategy, which looks at conflict prevention and response, integrates gender analysis and sees violence against women and girls as a key cause and consequence of violent conflict. That is the kind of work that needs to be done, and that is the kind of work I am hoping the resources currently being given to the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative will then go on to do in the months and years ahead. Chair: We were coming on to that. I should point out that we are not halfway through the topics we wish to cover, and we are three-quarters of the way through the time we had allocated, so I ask everybody to move it along a bit, because we would like to cover them all. Q86 Fabian Hamilton: Sir John, nice to see you again. I think we last met in Washington at the UN, when you were there. I want to continue what Michael McCann has been discussing, the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative and its cross-departmental working. We have had witnesses say to us that DFID's participation in the PSVI remains \"unclear\". Saferworld, for example, said, \"It will be important for the Government to articulate [DFID's] role in order to ensure that this initiative takes advantage of DFID's expertise on tackling V AWG in a longer-term, holistic way,\" as Michael mentioned. Could you tell us what you think should be the way that DFID can see a complementary working between PSVI and its growing portfolio of initiatives on violence against women and girls? Sir John Holmes: The important thing from our point of view is that there is a joined-up approach here. Whatever the origins of the initiative may be, and whatever feelings of \"not invented here\" syndrome and all that sort of thing may have been there at the beginning, it is important the two Departments, and Departments more widely, including MOD and so on, do get involved in this in an integrated way. My colleagues are closer to this and may see it slightly differently, but my perception is that that is happening\u2014not as fast as we would like, perhaps, but it is beginning to happen. It is being tackled in an integrated way. The Foreign Ofce has realised that DFID needs to be centrally engaged in this, and DFID has realised they need to be centrally engaged in this. That sort of joined-up working is starting to happen. The main point that needs to be there is that the Foreign Ofce can highlight or spearhead this kind of initiative, but the services on the ground are not their job, and will not be their job. They can give it a realEv 30 International Development Committee: Evidence 12 March 2013 Sir John Holmes, Chitra Nagarajan and Kerry Smith prole that we would not have had otherwise, and get it into places that DFID could not have got it into, but then DFID will have to run with the consequence of it, and run with the practical projects, programming and funding on the ground over the long term. As I say, this struggle is not a single decision or a single speech. It really is a marathon, not a sprint. Q87 Fabian Hamilton: But it is not clear, is it, how far into the future this will go, or what funding there is for the next few years. Do you have any different view? Do you have any different information about whether this will continue for the next ve or 10 years, or whether it is just a short-term initiative? Sir John Holmes: My guess is that the PSVI may be relatively short term, but what then lies behind it, and what DFID do to pick it up and run with it, for example the international call to action by Justine Greening and the summit next autumn, lays the foundation for something much more long term, which is of course what it needs to be. Chitra Nagarajan: I would also recommend that the FCO does not pass this over to DFID at the end of this year and continues to see this as a key diplomatic priority for them as well. Q88 Fabian Hamilton: You all mentioned the UK's leading role in this particular eld and this particular initiative, but isn't this something where good working and good practice could be spread to other countries, to the UN itself, and as you mentioned, Sir John, to peacekeeping forces on the ground? Chitra Nagarajan: I understand that quite a few of the other G8 members have taken this on, and are pursuing this anyway. I agree that it needs to be spread more broadly, and it needs to be spread more broadly than the G8, and there needs to be more ownership and leadership from fragile and conflict-affected states themselves in the international sphere, but also in terms of exchanging lessons and best practices between them. That is something I would like to see the UK Government supporting more. Sir John Holmes: I think one particular target should also be ECHO and the European Commission, to make sure they fully adopt this and run with it. There is no reason why they should not, but it has not happened fully yet. Kerry Smith: I do not have much to add, just a little reflection, which is that people are worried about the integration with DFID and what DFID's role is. On a practical implementation level, it is the conflict and humanitarian team who are training and recruiting the team of experts who will be going out to do this work. There is investment by DFID in the initiative and the implementation of it. It is the linking up of the investment on the implementation side with the strategic vision. I believe that the call for a humanitarian summit is part of linking the strategic vision from this initiative to a longer term, more embedded pool of work, which is to be welcomed. Q89 Jeremy Lefroy: Good morning. I would just like to go back to the National Action Plan, which you were mentioning, Chitra, just a few minutes ago. You said there was a concern that it was siloed andnot integrated, I think, if I am quoting you correctly. How effective do you think the UK's implementation of the NAP has been, and how could it be more effective? Perhaps you could go into some more detail on that. Chitra Nagarajan: Yes, of course. The UK is doing an evaluation of the National Action Plan this year, so the full answer to your question will come out in a few months' time. In terms of the National Action Plan, the UK's work on this has been increasingly effective. The National Action Plan that we have currently is better than the one we had previously, and I am very much hoping that the new National Action Plan that will be developed this year will be better still. However, I think there are key issues around resources allocated to the National Action Plan. For example, only within the last few months do we have one full-time person within the Foreign and Commonwealth Ofce devoted to the National Action Plan. Before that, it was one of, I think, four priorities she had. We have only recently had somebody within DFID, who now spends 20% of her time on the National Action Plan. I believe there need to be greater stafng resources allocated to the NAP. There needs to be more funding allocated to the National Action Plan as well. The National Action Plan has no budget allocated to it, and this really limits the effectiveness of its work. Where I think the National Action Plan has been most effective is in ensuring that commitments in it act as a way to leverage the machinery of Government to ensure that women, peace and security are integrated when it comes to other policies and practice. For example, there is a commitment in the National Action Plan to ensure that gender analysis is mainstreamed within the Building Stability Overseas Strategy, which then has given ofcials within Government leverage to make sure that that is being done. That is a very incomplete story, in that I believe that gender analysis is not adequately mainstreamed within the BSOS, which is the main conflict prevention and response strategy that the UK Government has. For example, the guidelines that I have seen around how to develop conflict analysis do not require gender analysis to be taken into account here. The country strategies that have come as a result of this are classied, so I have not had a chance to see them, but my sense is, going by the JACS guidelines, that gender is not being adequately looked at in other cross-governmental policies. The answer is that it is getting better, but there is still a long way for the UK Government to go when it comes to the National Action Plan and ensuring that the principles of the National Action Plan are integrated into all policies and strategies. The real gap is between policy and practice. We have the National Action Plan, but we need to make sure that, when the UK Government hosts a conference on Somalia, looks at what it is doing in Afghanistan, or looks at what it is doing in DRC and in other fragile and conflict-affected states, it does not remain in a nice document in London but is integrated into the job descriptions of members of staff, performanceInternational Development Committee: Evidence Ev 31 12 March 2013 Sir John Holmes, Chitra Nagarajan and Kerry Smith indicators, and also into the work that is being done in-country to make sure that we have real, meaningful, genuine and long-lasting change for women living in fragile and conflict-affected states. Q90 Jeremy Lefroy: I just want to pick up on something we spoke about briefly earlier, which is also a major part of the NAP: the role that women should play in conflict and peace processes. A question I wanted to follow up on that\u2014perhaps addressed to Sir John\u2014was whether there is much more that we could do in the way of strategic training, particularly at a high level, for the involvement of women in peace processes: whether that is going on now, whether it is something the UN has looked at and, if not, whether it is something it should do and an area that DFID could perhaps support you in. Sir John Holmes: The UN has certainly looked at this, and is very conscious of this absence of women from peace processes and conflict resolution efforts. By the way, I would say it is not just an absence of women, but also an absence of civil society in general. One of the sad things about conflicts is that when it comes to settling them, you only have the men with guns there. You do not have the civil society there in any meaningful way. We saw that happen in Darfur, DRC and other places. It is a wider point than just the women, but women are a very specic and obvious example of it. The UN has understood this is a problem. Solving it is, of course, more difcult. It is easy to say, but quite hard to do, because very often the people involved in the conflicts are not willing to have women on their delegations, and do not know who they would be. That is where there is a possibility of the UN, but also DFID and the UK Government, trying to help identify people, train them and make them capable of participating in these things in a way that will then be accepted by the other members of these delegations, whoever they may be. It is a vicious circle\u2014because there is not anybody there, there is not anybody there\u2014so we have to break that. Maybe identifying civil society, helping them, giving them a bit of funding if necessary, is one way of putting at least the thin end of the wedge into it and hopefully increasing it. Chitra Nagarajan: If I could just add a point on there, there is yet to be a woman who has been appointed by the UN as a chief mediator in a peace process. One of the things we are recommending is that the UK take a lead on developing a roster of women who could do this kind of work, and giving them training, because we need to look at the international peace and security structures, as well as looking at participants to a peace process. We know that women in countries all around the world are the ones who are building the peace. The role of women in building peace and stability has been very well documented, but it is quite ignored. The way to have an effective process\u2014it is a matter of rights, but it is also a matter of what works\u2014is to have more women involved. Q91 Jeremy Lefroy: I have one nal question, if I may, Chairman. Very specically, the UK has a peace and stabilisation unit in Nairobi, which does a lot ofwork with East African armed forces. I wondered if anybody on the panel is aware of whether this particular role of specialists in preventing violence against women and children in conflict is one that the UK is introducing into that particular programme, given its importance in that part of the world in training peacekeepers for missions across East and Central Africa. Chitra Nagarajan: I do not know I am afraid. Sir John Holmes: There is a very important general point there, which is that when you are trying to prevent violence against women, what we need is fewer speeches at the UN and more people who go and talk to the military contingent, including the militias, who are responsible for most of this stuff in a place like DRC. We need people who will go and talk to leaders and say, \"You have to stop this happening, not just because you will be arrested and put on trial if you do not, but because this is a very bad thing for your organisation to be doing and you are responsible for it.\" That is much harder to do than to make a nice speech in the General Assembly, but that is what needs to happen. Jeremy Lefroy: Thank you. I think, Chairman, that is one thing we can take up with the Secretary of State. Q92 Chair: Yes. I just wondered if you could comment briefly on the role of the Ministerial Champion. Lynne Featherstone was appointed to that role, in fact, when she was in the Home Ofce, but she has come into DFID with that. How effective do you think the role has been and how much more effective do you think it could be, if you do not feel it has reached its full potential? Kerry Smith: It is part of building the Government's position and commitment to tackling violence against women and girls. The fact that the Minister had experience in the Home Ofce, looking at equality and looking at some cross-cutting issues like early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation, meant that she was very well placed to take this position and move it forward internationally. There is a question of resourcing\u2014there always is\u2014 and if she and her team were resourced more strongly, her work in terms of working with other Ministers from international development ministries would be strengthened, especially because, from Plan's perspective, she is in a very key role, because of her linking of education and violence against women and girls. School-related gender-based violence is a key issue for girls across the world. We need girls to continue their education if we want to change patterns and norms of accepting violence. We need to engage boys at schools to do this too. She has a key role, but it is about whether she is resourced to be able to push that through on the international stage as well as in terms of the departmental work she does. Chitra Nagarajan: I would also like to raise the point here that, as far as I am aware, her terms of reference have yet to be published and disseminated, and this is something that it would be very good for civil society to see. I would also like to raise the point here around the DFID Operational Plans. At the moment, each country has an Operational Plan that runs until 2015, and DFID country ofcers are starting to thinkEv 32 International Development Committee: Evidence 12 March 2013 Sir John Holmes, Chitra Nagarajan and Kerry Smith through what the next set of Operational Plans should be. We very strongly believe that violence against women and girls specically, and women's rights more generally, need to be reflected in each country's Operational Plan. I would very much like to see Operational Plans for fragile and conflict-affected countries talk about the National Action Plan and outline how the UK is meeting its women, peace and security commitments. That is something potentially the Ministerial Champion could take up. Kerry Smith: I would echo that. Operational Plans are obviously strategic visions for a country, but this is a strategic aim\u2014to end violence against women and girls. It is a key place we would like to see that reflected. Chair: You think her role should be more clearly dened, and more focussed, and also resourced? She is giving evidence to us, so we can obviously draw that out. Q93 Pauline Latham: I am conscious of the time, so very briefly, what do you think the priorities for DFID should be in expanding its programme on violence against women and girls at country level? Sir John Holmes: At country level the same applies as at international level, which is that when it is looking at what it wants to fund, whether it be in emergencies or longer term development work, it needs to make sure that the organisations it is working with, the organisations it is funding, whether they are international agencies or local NGOs and civil society organisations, have this built into their programme and any proposals they make to DFID for funding, and then have to report on it afterwards. That same sort of insistence on it being there and being accountable for what has happened at national level will work just as well on an international level. That also means that the DFID staff on the ground have to have that kind of training and guidance built into what they do right from the beginning, which means they all need to have had that training, and that is something that has not happened yet and needs to happen, so that it becomes automatic. It needs to be a real priority, not a box-ticking priority, for them to make sure it happens on the ground. That would be my response. Chitra Nagarajan: I have four points, if I may. The rst is that my sense is that work on violence against women and girls is not institutionalised at the country level. It happens rather at an ad hoc level, depending on the commitment and interest of staff there, and there seems to be as a result a disjuncture between rhetoric and reality. What is needed, as Sir John mentioned, is training for all DFID staff on women's rights, which includes training on violence against women and girls. It needs to be pushed out by DFID here as a priority. Obviously the Secretary of State is very committed to this, but that political commitment needs to translate to the country level. Secondly, there needs to be more focus on the root causes of violence, supporting women's empowerment and leadership, and looking at the role of women's rights organisations and women's human rights defenders. There needs to be specic fundingand support given to women's human rights defenders, given the attacks they face but also their critical role in enabling change. Finally, I want to talk very quickly, if I may, about Afghanistan. The Secretary of State has committed that addressing violence against women and girls should be a priority goal in the DFID Operational Plan for Afghanistan. That is something we have been recommending to DFID and we are very happy to see this, but we very strongly believe that this should be developed in consultation with women's rights organisations and women running shelters and providing other services in the country. I was hoping to get information from the Afghan Women's Network in time for today, to present to you, and unfortunately they are still gathering their thoughts, but I will send that to you so that you can reflect it in your thinking and report. Consultation with the women who are doing the work is really key to ensuring that intervention is targeted and effective. Kerry Smith: I have one key point to add to that: build on the work they are doing on education. There are lots of things they can build on if they integrate their strategies around violence against women and girls in their education programming, making sure in that dialogue with national governments that violence against women and girls is introduced into ensuring safer schools, into the curriculum, and in scaling up the programmes they have already seen success on, which include having spaces for discussion for girls and having reporting mechanisms distinguished around where you can go if you are suffering from violence. They should also look at the issues of slow-onset emergencies, ensuring that as they prioritise education and violence against women and girls within that category, they also look at issues of flexibility for funding and ensuring that, from their development programme into their humanitarian programme, there is an ability to address the needs as they arise, so that education does not just stop, because that really is where you will tackle the root causes. It is also where you will be able to prevent a lot of the violence that girls suffer from. Q94 Fiona O'Donnell: Good morning. I apologise that I was not here at the start. I am trying to be in two Committees at the same time this morning. I think you have answered my rst question; you have talked about training and what needs to change in terms of having the right resources there, and no one seems to be arguing that we have the appropriate staff at the appropriate levels just now in DFID. I wanted to ask about the decision to move the Violence Against Women and Girls team from Policy to the Conflict, Humanitarian and Security Department. Given that we all agree we cannot tackle violence without addressing gender inequalities and the Gender Team is located in the Policy division, do you think that was the right decision? Do you think that will have an impact on joined-up working? Chitra Nagarajan: My sense is, and this is going back to what I said earlier about the collapsing of the women, peace and security agenda and the violence against women and girls agenda, I understand theInternational Development Committee: Evidence Ev 33 12 March 2013 Sir John Holmes, Chitra Nagarajan and Kerry Smith reasons for the shift; they are trying to have Gender people across the whole range of DFID departments. However, I think that having the Violence Against Women and Girls team situated within CHASE adds to the collapsing of the two agendas, and the conflation of those two agendas. I want to say that the Violence Against Women and Girls team have been doing a very good job in terms of pushing the agenda within DFID, but they do seem rather overworked in my opinion, and if we are talking about the team itself, I would like to see them getting additional stafng resources, especially given that this has become such a priority for the Secretary of State. I am not quite sure how they will deal with all the work that is being created as a result. It is an indication of their success, but we need to reward that. Sir John Holmes: Chitra is probably right about the resources, but I do not really agree about where they should be. I think it is good to have a unit like that attached to the people who are taking the funding decisions and doing the operational stuff on the ground. The difculty about being in a policy unit is it can seem to be a separate unit, thinking great thoughts in an ivory tower, and not really linked to what is happening on the ground. By putting them in CHASE, you are creating that link. There are other risks with it too, I accept that, but I rather welcome it. Having had organisations where people have been in those boxes, I think this is a way of un-siloing them, and making sure that their concerns are fed through straight onto the ground. Kerry Smith: I would say we should not be complacent. Just because you have the Violence Against Women and Girls team situated within CHASE does not mean that the rest of CHASE responds to that agenda. We need to look and make sure that they are adequately resourced, and adequately resourced to have that engagement in that operational decision-making, which is exactly the use or benet of them being placed in that unit. Q95 Fiona O'Donnell: An important component of preventing violence against women and girls is making sure that those who are guilty of violent crimes are prosecuted. I wondered, given the situation in Bosnia, where we have had fewer than 40 prosecutions, do you see any chance of that happening, and that threat really being there for the kind of people you were talking about in the militia? Is there any chance that they would be prosecuted if they were to commit acts of violence? Sir John Holmes: There have been some prosecutions. I think it was Mr Lubanga who was indicted and convicted by the International Criminal Court. It was their rst conviction, and his basic convictions were for sexual crimes. That was a very good signal. Unfortunately that has not been followed up by a lot of other signals. There is a really difcult problem in a place like DRC, as we were discussing earlier. The justice infrastructure in Eastern DRC is more or less non-existent. I am slightly exaggerating, but only slightly. Replacing it with some international form of justice, however, is fraught with problems as well. It is extremely expensive, not necessarily well receivedlocally, and so on and so forth. Everybody can agree that ending impunity is absolutely crucial; providing justice for the people who are perpetrating these appalling crimes is essential, but we are not quite sure how we will achieve that in practice. That is one of the big challenges for the Foreign Secretary's initiative. The other thing is that not all women believe that justice is what they need most. They often do want to see justice, but that is not necessarily why they go to someone to talk about it. They may need other help, and that is the other help we can provide. That is why we need to have the range of responses available, and not just focus on the justice side. Q96 Chair: One nal question. The Department set up a \u00a325 million research fund to look at primary prevention, violence and conflict in humanitarian situations, and the economic and social costs of violence, which are all good issues. Are those the right ones? Are there any others that you think such a research project should address? Sir John Holmes: We very much welcome that fund. We believe that sort of data collection and analysis very much needs to be done, and it needs to be commissioned by DFID but not done by DFID, necessarily. We are trying to be part of that bidding process with other people, so we think it is very welcome. Q97 Chair: Presumably the point of it is to help influence other players to recognise how important it is, and that putting money into it is benecial for development. It is not just a conscience thing. It is practically benecial. Kerry Smith: Yes. They have covered the broad bases in terms of what they want to focus on. I think it will provide, rst of all, that kind of practical research and innovation that could lead to the scaling up of successful programmes, or new programmes that really work on the ground, but it could also provide that evidence that will persuade other actors\u2014both national Governments as well as other international actors. We would hope, and we are also engaged in this with other civil society organisations, that adolescent girls get a look in, and that the specic needs of adolescent girls are focussed on in some of this, and also that there is a willingness to bring together the violence against women and girls and education agendas, to really have a look at how you address, prevent and respond to school-related gender- based violence. Chitra Nagarajan: Very briefly, it is difcult to comment fully on the fund because we have not had further information since it was announced. I would hope that at least some of it would go to funding the innovative work that is being done by women's rights organisations in-country, who have been doing this work for years, and also that it looks at change over the long term as well, given we know how long it takes to ensure changes in norms, behaviours, attitudes and practices. Finally, there is a commitment in the National Action Plan to commission research on gender, conflict and peace. We are not quite sure where this money is coming from, and when we talk to civil servants theyEv 34 International Development Committee: Evidence 12 March 2013 Sir John Holmes, Chitra Nagarajan and Kerry Smith talk about this fund. Now, of course, as I keep on saying, women, peace and security is wider than violence against women and girls, and violence against women and girls is wider than women, peace and security, so it is a bit of a concern that they are thinking of using this fund to fund research on women, peace and security. We worry that then we are focusing only on violence against women and girls that happens in fragile and conflict-affected states, and both agendas are much wider than that. Examination of Witness Witness: Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland , ex-Prime Minister of Norway, The Elders, gave evidence. Q98 Chair: Good morning, Dr Brundtland. Dr Brundtland: Good morning. Chair: Thank you very much for coming in. I appreciate that we are slightly later than you anticipated. Dr Brundtland: That is ne. Chair: I guess you were able to see how the session was going beforehand. Welcome, and thank you very much indeed. You are here as a very distinguished Elder to give us your views and your experience, and I do not think an introduction on your own is required. Welcome and thank you very much. I wondered if we could set the scene. You have, as I say, a distinguished career. You have been a doctor, a Prime Minister, a former Director of the World Health Organisation. In your experience, what is your take on the extent to which violence against women and girls impacts on development and indeed on social progress? What is your own take on how signicant an issue it is, and how big an impact it has? Dr Brundtland: It is nice to be here with you, and I am glad that you have this issue on the agenda. That is important in itself. Of course, the UK Government has been playing an important role on issues of this kind\u2014together, may I say, with Norway and others\u2014 so I am happy to be here. When you look at the issue of violence against women, of course it is linked to the fact that across the world, in so many countries, discrimination against women is continuously happening. Violence is part of a pattern that is linked to discrimination. As you focus on violence, it has to focus on inequalities, on discrimination, and on the cultural and traditional aspects of many countries across the world that are still in a kind of historic picture of looking at women as a second sex and as an inferior sex compared with men. I just came from the celebration of 100 years of women voting in Norway. We had that last Friday. Chair: You are way ahead of us in celebrating 100 years. Dr Brundtland: I know, also on this one, yes. Generally on these kinds of issues, we collaborate well with the United Kingdom, but we did have a kind of pioneer role in this sense. Now I say that because as we look at what has happened in those 100 years, I had to express two main things in the brief policy statement that I made on direct broadcasting from Kristiansand in the south of Norway. One is that we have to be vigilant in our own country. Although weChair: Thank you all very much indeed. It has been a very helpful and interesting session. You all have different points to bring to bear. We thank you very much indeed for coming in and doing those. I apologise slightly to Mrs Brundtland: she has been here listening patiently, but we are looking forward to hearing what she has to say as well. Thank you very much. have come far in reaching equality, it is easy to get backlashes, and we have to be vigilant, even in countries like Norway. Secondly, the biggest concern when you look at celebrating 100 years is looking across the world and looking at young girls being forced into marriage at 10, 12, 14 years of age, and the fact that girls are not being fed the same way as boys, because boys get the food rst, and the fathers before the mothers\u2014the boys before the girls. In addition, girls are kept out of school because they are supposed to be carrying water and rewood, and basically helping the family have the boys go to school. This sounds like some kind of extreme situation, in maybe only a few places. It sounds like that to many people, but it is not. It is across continents in so many countries, which is why, as Elders, from the beginning, when Nelson Mandela called us together and we discussed the priority concerns as we looked at the world today, in trying to overcome conflict in areas where conflict has been intractable, we tried to see if an independent group like ours could be helpful. When you look at other main thematic issues, discrimination against women we identied immediately. We spoke out on tradition and religion as creating the basis and being misused to keep traditions and cultures that discriminate against women. As Elders, we have spoken out on that, because it is a major concern. Then we looked at what, of all the issues linked with discrimination against women, we could try to make a difference on: specically, things that have been forgotten or are concealed by other issues. Having analysed it for a year, and having had several debates, we ended up putting child marriage in front. Child marriage is a symbol of and a symptom of inequality in cultures and traditions that undermine the futures of girls. When it undermines the futures of girls, it undermines the future of their offspring. You keep girls and women in a subdued, subverted situation of not being able to choose for themselves, not being able to continue in school, and in those ways we gradually built an alliance called Girls Not Brides, with 200 different NGOs linked up to help overcome child marriage by 2030. The extent of discrimination illustrates how much there is to be done, and that means violence is linked to it, culturally and traditionally.International Development Committee: Evidence Ev 35 12 March 2013 Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland Q99 Chair: Thank you for that. We visited an example of that project in Amhara Province in Ethiopia in the last week. I think it is worth pointing out, on the basis of what you said, that what inspired us was rst of all a priest speaking out against child marriage, a mother who had sent her daughter to a child marriage essentially saying she had got it wrong, and a young girl who had been through the experience. I will give you a little commercial: we have a small video on our website of those particular things, which highlights those interviews with those people, and perhaps demonstrates progress. It relates to the next question, and you may be a Norwegian, but feel free to reply about what you think our Government can do: DFID and other countries are putting this up the agenda now. What do you think the UK Government, and DFID in particular, can do to add value to that prioritisation of the issue? Dr Brundtland: To the whole wider violence issue? Yes. Certainly it is crucial that some countries, and as many as possible that carry some weight internationally, keep this high on the agenda. If that does not happen, we will see backlashes. I was thinking about the Cairo 1994 meeting. In front of me as I was speaking was President Mubarak and his wife. I specically remember how President Mubarak smiled and was nodding as I was making a quite radical statement in that summit of the United Nations on women and family planning and population. Still, we succeeded: if you look at the text there, the role of women, the link to the rights of women in reproductive health and sexual rights were all taken care of, and so although you can say a lot about Egypt and Mubarak, when they were hosting that conference I believe that Egypt helped avoid extremism weakening the text. However, in the last nearly 20 years, and certainly in the last 10 years, I have seen backpush, systematically trying to undermine and get away from part of the Cairo language, and other important international documents. What is happening now in New York, in the Committee meeting that is still going on this week, ending on Friday, is the same issue: trying to put cultural and sovereignty issues above and beyond general human rights concerns and obligations. That is what some countries are really trying to do: to push for a real setback and to get agreement that countries on a sovereign basis can dene their own cultural needs, above and beyond human rights. This is absolutely unacceptable. I met this in Davos, during the time that I was Director-General, so some time around 2000. The Foreign Minister of Iran was at a luncheon table with me and with seven or eight mostly European leaders, Prime Ministers and Foreign Ministers. He was speaking about cultural rights\u2014intelligently, enthusiastically\u2014and people around the table were nodding, listening to the man talking about this. I kept silent, looking in fascination at him and at my former colleagues, and my rst statement was: \"Everything I have heard is good and well, as soon as you conrm that, of course, the Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 still stands,\" because what he was basically saying was that he was trying to supersede human rights with something called cultural rights, which ofcourse were dened by religious or other political leaders in different countries, one by one. That was an early sense that I got of how bad the backpush towards the UN Declarations was going to be, and now, 13 years later, it is still going on in New York at this specic time. Unless you have countries like the United Kingdom working hard to avoid this and to ght against this, together with others, it is really dangerous. Q100 Mr McCann: Good morning, Dr Brundtland. We are just back from Ethiopia, and you have visited Ethiopia as well, and we met girls. I think people in your country and in our country would be horried to learn what is happening on the ground. We were told in brieng sessions that boys and girls were promised as early as six years old, and they were then married when the girl had matured enough to menstruate, so you could be talking about 12, 13 or 14. These events are been televised across the UK, and probably across the world, but I think it is important for people to realise that we took testimony from a 22-year-old woman who had been married at six to an older man, and had been forced to have sexual intercourse at that age. I think people would be horried. Dr Brundtland: At the age of nine? Mr McCann: Six. Dr Brundtland: That is unusual, but yes. Mr McCann: She had been internally destroyed, and she was married again and she was fearful that her husband would divorce her because she was no longer able to have children. That is the reality on the ground in terms of those cultural problems that you spoke about so vividly a few moments ago. In terms of UK development assistance, where should our efforts be focussed in terms of the monies that we are putting into ending this terrible infliction of child marriage? Where would you advise us to place more money? Is it in more research, or is it in the type of programmes we have seen in the Amhara region of Ethiopia? Dr Brundtland: Research is always important. Unless we have an evidence base to spread, it does not work. However, it is more important, in my mind now, to use the research we already have, because there is a lack of action in promoting the necessary changes. In countries like Ethiopia and others with very high levels of child marriage, which illustrate the discrimination against women and the culture and traditions linked to that, we need to help people work directly with communities, with men, with priests\u2014 with all the groups directly at the local level. That is what really works. This is what we saw in Ethiopia too: some of the programmes that were also functioning there\u2014partly also with United Nations Foundation funding, by the way, to which I also belong\u2014with people collaborating to have a debate or a dialogue going on in the local communities. It helped. After a few years there was a change of opinions. Of course it is a long-term thing, but change happens even within a few years. I remember a young girl of maybe 15. She was sitting there with her husband. They had been married off; he was maybe two or three years older than her, and they brought the boys, the men, the mothers, all age groups, into village discussions, with people asking questions andEv 36 International Development Committee: Evidence 12 March 2013 Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland commenting, and thinking for themselves whether this was a good practice or not. This young couple were sitting there holding hands, and they told their story. The girl said, \"When I married three years ago I was just pulled out of my home, and I did not know my husband, etc.\" The most impressive thing was that she said, \"In the rst two years, my husband never used my name. It was 'It', 'That'. 'You are supposed to fetch the wood. You are supposed to fetch the water. You are supposed to cook my meal.'\" He never used her name. However, after having these discussions, he realised that this was not a good idea. He had started talking to her by name, asking her, and helping her in the home. That was only a two-year process, which had led couples to change their ways. That means the children coming out of that marriage will not be given away in child marriage. Q101 Chris White: Can I interrupt briefly? You talk about working with priests on a local level. I wondered if you could be a bit more specic about which religions you were talking about, and whether you have talked to more senior members of those religions? Dr Brundtland: What we as Elders have been doing is talking with religious leaders at the top level. Chris White: Of which religions? Dr Brundtland: All the major religions. When we visited Egypt, we went into speaking with the\u2014it is basically Muslim, but there are also some Christians. I do not remember the name of it, but it is a high-level religious leaders' group. We have done it at that level, but by speaking with them, and also speaking with Government people, Prime Ministers and regional politicians, we have also inspired them to bring in the religious leaders in their own efforts to try to implement their own laws. As you know, laws are in many places, but they are not being implemented. They are not even taken seriously. You need to involve all parts of society, and certainly religious leaders at all different levels. We met with priests in Ethiopia too\u2014I mean religious gures. I do not know whether it was a priest, but it was a religious person in that village context, and he was supportive of the debates that were going on, and helping. Q102 Fabian Hamilton: Very briefly, on the very touching example you gave of the young couple who now have a much broader view, thanks to the intervention and the village discussion amongst everybody, you said that you did not think the children coming out of that marriage would have to suffer the same fate of child marriage in the future. How can you be sure that the peer pressure of the village and the culture does not override the light that has been seen after that discussion, and the enlightened view that perhaps you saw? Dr Brundtland: What I feel is that increasing numbers of examples of young people who have understood that they are not destined to do exactly what their parents did will increase the deliberation and awareness in many different families in such a local community. They were supporting each other,saying, \"We do not accept anymore that we should be forced into marriage, and that we are marrying so young.\" There was a deliberate approach. This is just an example, this couple: there were others, and the village was there, in the different generations, listening to these young people. Obviously it is not easy, 15 years from now, to be exactly the same as they were ve years ago. This will denitely give change. There is an important example. I happened to be on the jury of the Hilton Foundation, the humanitarian prize. It is the biggest prize after the Nobel Prizes. We gave it to the leader of Tostan, which worked in Senegal on female genital cutting. She was an American who came to Senegal in her twenties to do a Master's study and never left Senegal; instead she created an NGO, and recruited midwives and others who had been doing female cutting and who realised that this was wrong, who started working with her, going into the villages in Senegal. Now this is 20 years ago, and the scene is changed in Senegal. However it has taken 15 or 20 years. There has been a consistent approach, sitting down, speaking with people, answering their questions, and asking them questions about why certain practices are done and whether they are aware that they pose dangers to the future reproduction in their girls. Some die from this female cutting. Others are ruined by it. That debate has been going on for years, and it has changed attitudes. Female cutting is down in Senegal. It illustrates that when you speak with people, and when you have this kind of dialogue, and you dare to speak and tell about the dangers, then people start opening their minds, and they start asking questions of their own peers: \"Why are we doing this? Should we continue? Maybe we should change.\" People can change attitudes. They have before, and they need to do so on these kinds of issues. We have to help them do it, so helping to create the room for these dialogues in the worst affected areas is an important priority. Q103 Mr McCann: I have a number of prepared questions that I am going to dump, because you have made a couple of interesting points. The rst is that my colleague, Chris White, mentioned how you influenced church leaders and so on and so forth. You explained that you talked to them. When we were in Ethiopia, we met imams and priests who had changed their minds on polygamy, FGC and child marriage, which was fantastic. However, the problem was\u2014and Chris asked this question when we were there\u2014there is no hierarchical structure that allows someone at the very top of the church, like a\u2014 Dr Brundtland: Caliph or whatever? Mr McCann: Papal edict or whatever happens in other churches, and it flows down. That did not exist. The rst question would be, how does it help speaking to church groups who do not have hierarchical structures, which do not allow the message to flood down? My second point would be this: in terms of the point you make about culture overriding human rights, how do we overcome that and shine a light on these issues? Do we need an international summit on child marriage? Do we need a Security Council resolutionInternational Development Committee: Evidence Ev 37 12 March 2013 Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland on child marriage? In your opinion, with your wealth of experience, what would be the best way forward? Dr Brundtland: The weaknesses or lack of good institutions is one problem we face in many areas. If in many religions, countries or regions there is no top leadership above the priests, it is a challenge. However, if there is not, we have to try to reach the grassroots levels and the villages in which the priests are active, and work upwards. In most religions there is some influence by the top people on the rest. Of course we have Archbishop Tutu as our Chair, so he has been, in a long life, speaking with religious leaders across religions as part of his activity, whether on apartheid or other issues. He has a long tradition of reaching out, both at that level and at the more grassroots level. What can we do to overcome it? The thing is, I am sure social media, spreading the realities of what is happening, and how these things are linked, is one way that all of us have to try to do it, so that people are aware that human rights is not something self-evident. It is now two-thirds of a century since the Declaration on Human Rights, and we are still struggling with quite basic discriminatory issues in so many countries, affecting millions and millions. It is quite a tragedy. As we are sitting here, in New York they are having this discussion about the committee on discrimination against women, on violence, and making their report. They are struggling, and maybe they will not succeed, as they did not last year, because of the disagreements. It means instructions from the capitals of different countries to these delegations are such that there could be stalemate. We do not know. How do you influence global opinion to best effect change in the minds of different countries? There are so many entry points for that, but I am more and more convinced that social media and requesting transparency are some of the things that work most quickly. It pictures some of the village approaches I spoke about. When young people are reading on the internet and through social media what is happening, and they become aware, it helps. Certainly the main policy of not giving up on protecting the focus against discrimination against women, and violence against women which is linked to it, for the UK and for other countries who have understood these issues and want to campaign on them is a very important part of it. When David Cameron speaks about making forced marriage a criminal offence, when Prime Ministers speak out on these issues, it is intensely important. It is not enough, even if several Ministers engage, from Justice to Development Ministers to others who are working. In my country we have an Equality Minister, but in any case, you need these attitudes across Government. Unless the Foreign Ministers and Prime Ministers of countries speak out on these issues, they will not be given the most effective treatment with regard to change and potential for change. I congratulate you on the fact that the British Government has made this a priority and that they will be focusing on it in the G8 meeting. Chair: Chris White is about to go and meet the Prime Minister, so he can pass on those messages.Q104 Chris White: I will make that very comment to him. I wonder if you agree that an awful lot of discussion has taken place over the years, but an awful lot more action needs to take place. I think you would agree that the link between poverty and child marriage is very complex. How do you feel that donors such as DFID can best understand and address these linkages through the programmes currently in operation? What measures do you think have been proven to work\u2014 for example, in helping to compensate those who have lost or have had reduced dowries for poor families? Dr Brundtland: We were in Ethiopia, but then a group of us Elders went to India and discussed these issues at a high political level. I came back thinking, \"My goodness, here you have a constitution and laws that are very restrictive on child marriage, and they have been so since the British.\" It is an illustration that in the colonial time, the Brits left India and they helped the Indians make a constitution that looked reasonable, but the reality on the ground in a continent like India is so far from their principles that are placed in that constitution that people say, \"Oh, I am sorry, but it takes time; it is poverty.\" The respect for that constitution in so many areas is just not there. The gap between the so-called legal status and the reality on the ground is large. I do not see any other way of bridging that gap than getting the pressure from the middle class and from across India. We went to Bihar, and spoke with the leader of Bihar, and we spoke with young people having been organised to say, \"We do not want to marry before we are old enough, and before we choose our own spouse\". Boys and girls in some communities in Bihar were raising up and got our support, and we presented their attitudes to the leader of Bihar\u2014I think his name is Kumar. It is very much linked to poverty, because of course these young people we met were not the poorest. This is typical of change. On average, they had a little more education, a little less submission to their parents, were allowed to talk with other people outside the family, but they became models in their society, and given support, they spread the messages in the villages of Bihar. We have to go to the grassroots level in these countries. Q105 Chris White: You make a good point that legislation is not the only way, and probably not the biggest way of changing behaviours. It is through cultural change, and that cultural change will only happen through education. The nal part of my question would be to ask you what you feel in terms of which particular measures have been proven to work in engaging the very local communities in changing minds and attitudes. Dr Brundtland: I have to go back to the experience of Tostan in Senegal, and the experience now being used in several parts of Ethiopia, and also, as we are doing now in the Alliance on Child Marriage, supporting this kind of village and local activity change, which is supported by NGOs and I am sure there must be support from the UK as well. I do not know too much about DFID's budgets and so on, but I would be surprised if you are not already engaged in supporting some of these areas. That is where change is going to be promoted: working with othersEv 38 International Development Committee: Evidence 12 March 2013 Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland at the grassroots levels so change practices and traditions. As I heard John Holmes say, it is not enough to make a nice statement in the General Assembly, or in some Committee of the UN. But, as I said, if David Cameron or other leaders at that level speak out on the issues in simple terms, it makes a difference. It is heard. It depends on who says it. Q106 Fiona Bruce: I agree it is important to work with others to change practices and traditions, and in Ethiopia we saw some excellent work on child marriage. What we did not see was much work, if any, on the issue of marriage itself. We heard a lot about how high percentages of men and women there think it is, for example, acceptable to beat your wife. I wondered if you could tell us what work is being done, then, to ensure that once child marriage is considered unacceptable, so is a relationship within a marriage that is not one of equals and one of respect? Dr Brundtland: In these discussions, one does not only focus on the issue of child marriage. One focuses on the role and the rights of men and women, on violence as unacceptable, and also explains why. The debate is much broader: child marriage is one aspect, but also inside marriage, the way that women and men relate to each other should be and must be part of a broader discussion. Fiona Bruce: That is very helpful, thank you. Q107 Pauline Latham: What have been the conclusions of the Elders' campaign against child marriage, particularly with the role of education in combating it? Dr Brundtland: Education is crucial to all of the issues that we are discussing, whether it is child marriage or sexual violence relating to conflict and war. Education is maybe the most important method of overcoming these issues, in addition to health, because it makes an impact on parents if they realise that the practices that their community are following are dangerous to the health of the next generation. Although they obviously must have seen it, I believe more people realise when they get the statistics on how much more dangerous it is to bear children when you are 14, 15 or 16 years old, how many more face real, dangerous consequences, and how their children die more often. The maternal mortality rate is higher, and the child mortality rate is higher. When they become conscious of all of these issues, it helps, so health and education are really crucial issues. Q108 Pauline Latham: Do you have any particular recommendations you would like to make to DFID with the conclusions you have made? Dr Brundtland: I can talk about these things in principles, but I would have needed to know exactly where DFID is in its different priorities to be sure that I say the right thing. I will be careful, but DFID will understand what I am saying, and they will know how to look at how they are giving priorities to their own work. Q109 Fiona O'Donnell: Good morning, Dr Brundtland. Conflict and humanitarian crises can leadto an increase in child marriage, so what action do you think donors and NGOs can take to prevent that happening? Dr Brundtland: This of course has to do with how you try to help in conflict and with refugees. I am sure that what you are thinking about is that you have more examples, because people feel even more devastated and poor, and they are afraid of sexual violence hitting their girls, so they think it is a safer thing. Again, one has to have that broader conversation about the consequences with people, including over the long term. Of course if we do not have any alternative to offer families who feel this way, and if in fact one of their girls become one of the 60 million attacked sexually each year, going back and forth from school\u2014if they have schools, even, in refugee camps. It illustrates that in all these conflict situations and refugee situations, things just get worse than in the regular. It means even more emphasis on the same issues. I guess this is my only response. We have to be more vigilant about helping those in these critical situations, because life decisions can be taken when they are in a devastated condition, like in a refugee camp. Q110 Fiona O'Donnell: I suppose it is a choice for parents: is your daughter abused by one man, or by several? As mothers, who knows what choices we would make? Dr Brundtland: Yes. Q111 Fiona Bruce: Our Secretary of State Justine Greening has recently said that DFID will set up an Expert Advisory Group on girls and women. I would like to ask you who would be the right people to be represented on that group, which it is obviously hoped will have international impact? Dr Brundtland: Is it a group that will advise DFID? Or is it more giving international advice? Q112 Fiona Bruce: I think it is a group that ultimately will have international influence. She said it would include people from different worlds, to include leaders from the human rights community, the private sector and CSOs, feeding into DFID's work. We are interested to know, in your opinion, who would be the right people to be represented. Dr Brundtland: Certainly, when one uses the word \"expert\", it is important to avoid experts being only academicians or people who have research competence. Unless you have in that group people with practical experience from development work, and from situations where you are trying to overcome disparities and difculties of a developmental nature, then those experts will not be as effective. It needs to be a broader group of people, with people also with practical experience, not only academic experience. Q113 Chair: Dr Brundtland, you said something very important at the beginning about your table at Davos, and the Iranian Minister trying to promote cultural values over human rights values, as part of the pushback. We also encountered a slightly different problem in Ethiopia. It was a presentation by the Government that they needed to protect theInternational Development Committee: Evidence Ev 39 12 March 2013 Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland sovereignty of Ethiopia, and they therefore needed to limit the support that international NGOs could give to domestic NGOs to 10%. Because those domestic NGOs were small and obviously could only get an income base from a poor country, the implication was that it would make it very difcult for the programmes we saw, which were so good and which you have described, to extend across a country of 90 million people. How do you think we can tackle that in ways that do not look like\u2014if I can put it that way\u2014the developed world confronting the developing world with a suggestion of imposing values, as opposed to saying, \"We are trying to get you to unlock your own values and enable you to have a proper look at how traditional practices are holding back your development\"? Dr Brundtland: This issue was something we raised with the Health Minister of Ethiopia, the concrete issue you are talking about. He was trying to defend it or explain it, but I felt he was not convinced it was the right policy. He did his duty as a Minister and explained that this was necessary and so on, but I sense that he was not convinced himself. The same kind of thing is happening, of course, in Egypt. Over the last one and a half years there has been pushback against funding of NGOs that have funding from the outside world. That is to stop opposition, and it is the same issue. When I look at the groups of countries in the \"No Group\", ghting in New York against reasonable resolution text, among those countries there are Iran and a number of countries that you would identify as Muslim and, let me say, not-so-democratic countries. In addition, I always nd Russia there. I think maybe one reason why Russia is there is not because in Russia politicians think that discrimination against women out of tradition or religion is good. No; it is a much broader agenda. It is taking care of Russia's sovereignty and their right to decide for themselves. You have this going on. I was on the United Nations Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change that Ko Annan had, back in 2004. We proposed a number of changes in the UN system, and it was tough, because then you had the Iraq War, and people were very split, but the sovereignty issue came across in so many ways. Even in this area we are talking about, violence against women, people sitting at the top level of several countries are deciding, \"Do not let the UN and the international community interfere with our sovereignty\". It is a picture of how far we are from a fully democratic breakthrough in so many countries in the world. Q114 Chair: We hear those comments here from UK Government Ministers about the European Court of Human Rights. If developed countries are complaining about interferences in their sovereignty, what chance do we have of persuading developing countries of the merits of it? Dr Brundtland: You are right. It is a big challenge. Q115 Jeremy Lefroy: In evidence we had, I think, from World Vision, a couple of the reasons given forgirls being married young were to \"protect\" them from poverty, and to reduce families' own economic costs. Clearly the whole discussion about this must be based on one of equality, but has your group done any work to counter this image that somehow child marriage is important or necessary for economic reasons for a family, and to say that it does the opposite, and that by depriving girls of education it reduces economic opportunities? Has that work been done at a level where it is convincing to the people who are fearful of economic consequences? Dr Brundtland: What we have done in building this Girls Not Brides alliance is that we have had a couple of meetings in the establishment of it, and in the follow-up of the alliance, bringing people together who have worked at the NGO local level in different countries, and listening to their views about all these critical issues that we have been touching on. This was to help work together on formulating the best way of arguing the case. In a way, based on evidence and research, we have then also worked with people who had practical experience of what you need to convey, and how you need to counter these arguments. There is a body of language and way of addressing these issues, which has been developed by the Alliance itself, and then of course people in different countries will use those parts of these messages that are most effective in each case, because it depends on the history and culture of each country, or even of each part of a country. There is helpful material to be used in nding the right way, or hopefully the best way, to address these issues. Q116 Chair: On a positive note, we did get clear indication in Ethiopia that the Government of Ethiopia does want to end these practices. Their resistance to outside NGOs was precisely their concern about opposition, and it was not about resisting a drive to end these traditional practices. That is a positive part of the environment that we saw. You are absolutely right that the grassroots stuff, when it works\u2014as we saw it working\u2014is pretty inspirational and transformational. Dr Brundtland: When Carol Bellamy became the leader of Unicef\u2014I guess it was in 1994 or 1995\u2014I was Prime Minister of Norway. I met with the newly appointed Carol Bellamy, and she was enthusiastically explaining to me how Unicef now would put a lot more emphasis on the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and to see to it that constitutions across the world incorporated the main concerns in the Convention on the Rights of the Child. I was listening to her, and as I was listening to her, I realised, \"I have to tell Carol, 'Be careful,'\" because obviously then there was priority-setting between childhood vaccination, adolescent girls and all the other important issues that Unicef covers. They had limited funding, so I had to tell her, \"Carol, be aware that what counts, really, is what happens in reality. If you can be declaring that 10 more countries have had a nice constitution, unless you can measure that it affects children's lives, I am not sure whether you should not continue doing the health and development work that we know gets results.\" I am just leaving it with you, because it just occurred toEv 40 International Development Committee: Evidence 12 March 2013 Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland me as we were speaking. Yes, all of us want good constitutions, we want institutions, we want all states to have an infrastructure of legal rights and so on, but while this is happening, it is not enough, because it becomes theoretical, academic, high-level and sometimes does not at all affect the grassroots level. Chair: That is a very good point to nish on. Can I thank you very much indeed? We have very muchappreciated it. It is very valuable for us to have somebody of your range of experience and understanding of these issues to engage with us, so we really thank you very much indeed for taking the time and trouble to come and see us. Dr Brundtland: Thank you so much, and thank you for going to Ethiopia.International Development Committee: Evidence Ev 41 Thursday 9 May 2013 Members present: Sir Malcolm Bruce (Chair) Fiona Bruce Pauline Latham Jeremy Lefroy ________________ Examination of Witnesses Witnesses: Baroness Warsi , Minister of State, FCO, Emma Hopkins , Head of Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative, FCO and Louise de Sousa , Head of Human Rights and Democracy Department, gave evidence. Q117 Chair: Good morning, Minister, and welcome to our Committee. For the record, could you introduce your team? Baroness Warsi: Good morning. Thank you very much for inviting me. I have with me Louise, from HRDD, and Emma, who leads on the prevention of sexual violence initiative. Q118 Pauline Latham: Sorry, what is HRDD? Baroness Warsi: The human rights and democracy department. Q119 Chair: We are a bit hostile to acronyms. Baroness Warsi: I will try to stay away from them. Q120 Chair: There are so many, as there are in all specialist elds. As you know, we are doing an inquiry into violence against women and girls. We thought it was really important to get the Foreign Ofce's input, not least because the Foreign Secretary himself has taken a high prole on this. Obviously, you have specic ministerial responsibilities, so could you, rst, tell us more about the Foreign and Commonwealth Ofce's work in this area and your role in that. There may then be a couple of supplementaries. Baroness Warsi: Thank you for inviting me to give evidence. Thank you, too, for giving me my rst experience of a Select Committee. Violence against women and girls, and women's rights generally, come under the human rights department; it is one of our six key priorities, and it featured quite heavily in the human rights report, which was published last month. We lead on this area in international forums in a number of ways. On the Commission on the Status of Women, we were involved in the lobbying which eventually led to the consensus document earlier this year. At the United Nations Security Council, we are working through Resolution 1325 on implementing the National Action Plan. Again, the FCO, with other Departments, has the lead on that. We also lobby for the full implementation of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. At the United Nations Security Council later this year, we will be in the chair, and we will be using women's rights and violence against women as a key theme. We, of course, work with Lynne Featherstone, who is international champion on this issue. We welcome and support her role. With the Home Ofce, we also work,Mr Michael McCann Fiona O'Donnell Chris White through the consular department, with the Forced Marriage Unit, which also has an impact on this area. I particularly want to highlight an initiative you have touched on\u2014the Foreign Secretary's preventing sexual violence initiative, which was launched last year. Its latest success is the G8 Foreign Ministers declaration1, which is, again, a key reference point, and it will form the basis of further discussions at the G8 in June this year. Finally, why do we lead on so many issues in this area? Our network of 260-plus posts around the world gives us the perfect opportunity to lobby politically in this area. We also have one of the largest international development programmes, so there is a vehicle to deliver on the ground on some of these key political priorities. We are also a member of the Commonwealth and the EU, a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, and a member of the G8, so a series of forums give us the opportunity to take forward this priority. Q121 Chair: You imply that there is pretty active cross-departmental work. Are you satised that you are covering all the posts on that? Baroness Warsi: As a theme, this sits within human rights, and I lead on the human rights theme. We have been quite keen to mainstream the issue of women's rights. So when each of us, as Ministers, goes into our particular areas and countries of concern, we raise the issue of human rights. There is a clear message in terms of leadership, law and access to justice, and each of us makes sure we deliver it. For example, I have responsibility for Afghanistan and Pakistan, and I do some specic work on women's rights because I deal with those countries. Q122 Chair: But Jeremy Browne has been involved in this at the Home Ofce. Is he the lead Minister in this area? Baroness Warsi: There are different aspects to it. We lead on the political lobbying internationally\u2014if I had to encompass these issues in one sentence, that is what it would be. Q123 Chair: You have not specically worked on female genital mutilation. Is there a particular focus on that? Baroness Warsi: It is raised in countries where it is a concern\u2014for example, in north Africa, and some of 1Footnote by witness: G8 Declaration on Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict adopted 11 April.Ev 42 International Development Committee: Evidence 9 May 2013 Baroness Warsi, Emma Hopkins and Louise de Sousa the other African countries. It is also part of what we look at under the headings of violence against women and women's rights. But, certainly in the countries I have been specically involved with, it has not been an issue and, therefore, has not been raised. In my previous life, I was involved with FGM for many years, but that was predominantly from a domestic perspective, in terms of its impact on communities here. Chair: We have also looked into that. Q124 Fiona Bruce: Good morning, Minister. On 7 May, the Foreign and Commonwealth Ofce hosted a conference2on preventing sexual violence in Somalia. Could you tell us the outcomes of that conference? Baroness Warsi: Yes, Zainab Bangura, who is the special representative on this3, was at the Somalia conference. She had been to Somalia before the conference, and discussions had already taken place about what could be achieved. There have been some quite positive statements from the President about a zero-tolerance approach to sexual violence in Somalia. We are hoping that a UN team of experts will be going out to Somalia later this year to work out what exact programmes can be put in place. As in other countries, it is, rst of all, important to get the political leadership. The President and the Foreign Minister are clearly and openly committed to this issue, and they have given Zainab Bangura access\u2014 just getting the team there has been a challenge in some countries. Now, we are doing the real assessment on the ground of what can be put in place. Q125 Fiona O'Donnell: I wonder whether we can talk a bit more about the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative\u2014I hope I can be forgiven if I now call it the PSVI. What has it achieved so far? Where do you see room for improvement? Baroness Warsi: First, it has been a high-level political campaign. It is about saying that, for too long, this has been an issue we have had guidance on and we have talked about at the margins of meetings, but it is time to make it a priority. The fact that the Foreign Secretary is leading on this, that he has Zainab, from the UN, alongside him, and that people like Angelina Jolie are involved is putting a big, strong marker out there. We then have to raise the issue at every opportunity, whether that is through the G8, which has been one of the greatest successes up to now, or, subsequently, at the United Nations Security Council in June. It will also be a key theme for us at the United Nations General Assembly meeting. This is about constantly keeping this issue on the agenda. Q126 Fiona O'Donnell: My question was about what it has achieved, rather than what its objectives 2Footnote by witness: Somalia Conference London 2013. Preventing Sexual Violence was one of the priorities for the Somalia Conference on 7 May, which focused on international support behind the Somali government's priorities. The UN and Federal Government of Somalia signed a joint communiqu\u00e9 3Footnote by witness: Zainab Bangura is the Special Representative of the Secretary General on Sexual Violence in Conflictare. You mentioned the G8. Are there any other achievements so far that you can put down to this initiative? Where do you see room for improvement? Baroness Warsi: It has already set up a panel of experts; we have over 70 experts now. They have already been into Bosnia and Syria. Specically, they are working with health professionals in the refugee camps just outside Syria4so that health professionals can identify quickly, and respond to, cases of sexual violence. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, they have been involved with the OSCE\u2014I will get told off again for using acronyms\u2014to support the training of judges. One concern about Bosnia has been that thousands of women were subjected to rape, but very few prosecutions have taken place. The work involves training judges and looking at how we can increase the number of prosecutions. The experts team has also been on the ground in Libya to assess what support can be given to deal with the cases of sexual violence that have come to light there. Q127 Fiona O'Donnell: There have been criticisms that all the focus is on prosecution and investigation, rather than looking at the causes and the cultures that lead to violence against women. Do you see any room for the PSVI to address those root causes? Baroness Warsi: The two are linked; you must start to challenge the cultural norms and practices that create an environment in which sexual violence against women becomes acceptable to the point that people are not prosecuted. We do that anyway, as part of our country work, and a lot of DFID's work in terms of education and support around maternal health, reproductive health and the education of girls all supports and plays into this particular initiative. Why is this initiative important? To make quite a personal reference, as a solicitor, I dealt with a number of applications for asylum that came after the Balkans conflict. When I spoke to families or women claiming political asylum, the sexual violence element of what they had suffered did not come to light until months, sometimes years, after their initial meeting with me and their initial application. That led to all sorts of legal challenges, because questions would then be raised about the credibility of the witness and the evidence that she had given. I found that, rst, they did not think it was serious; secondly, they did not want to acknowledge it, because there was as much stigma to being a victim as to being a perpetrator; and thirdly, they felt that its impact on rebuilding their lives, especially if they claimed asylum as a partner, would very rarely come to light until\u2014 Q128 Fiona O'Donnell: So what are you doing about those barriers to justice? Baroness Warsi: One of the biggest issues was this culture of impunity\u2014this culture that it did not really matter\u2014so we rst have to challenge, politically, and say that the stigma lies with the perpetrator, not the victim. We have to keep saying that. We must constantly state that political message when we go 4Footnote by witness: In 2012 PSVI experts deployed to the Syria border and worked with health professionals to support refugees outside the camps. Training programmes will be extended in 2013International Development Committee: Evidence Ev 43 9 May 2013 Baroness Warsi, Emma Hopkins and Louise de Sousa overseas. The more that the women who report this are supported through the criminal prosecution of the perpetrators, and the more that the perpetrators are brought to justice and are convicted, the more women will start to have the condence to say, \"This isn't acceptable.\" Q129 Fiona O'Donnell: Our inquiry is not just about women; it is about girls as well. What support are you able to offer children who are victims and witnesses? What expertise do you have in your Department to ensure that children are kept safe through the process and afterwards? Baroness Warsi: We would rely on the experts on the panel to bring that expertise to the table; it would not be immediately\u2014 Q130 Fiona O'Donnell: Are there experts in child protection? Baroness Warsi: There are. There are about 73 or 74 experts. I could write to you with the full details of who they are and their expertise. I cannot tell you that off the top of my head. In addition, one of the successes of the G8 statement has been to look at women and child protection issues right at the beginning, in a conflict or humanitarian situation. For example, if an influx of refugees is arriving in a country, there seems to be an instinct to provide shelter and food, without thinking that if we provide right at the beginning appropriate sanitation facilities\u2014separate toilets, separate bathing areas\u2014 and cooking appliances that do not require women to travel far out of the camp to gather rewood, the scope for abuse is limited. When you talk about protection, for example, that means thinking about protection issues right at the beginning, because of the PSVI. Q131 Fiona O'Donnell: You were talking about training for judges. What are you doing about violence against women within justice systems? For example, women are victims of corporal punishment for things like adultery. What are you doing about that? Baroness Warsi: I was in Indonesia recently, where one of the islands is bringing back corporal punishment for adultery and sexual relations outside marriage, and we use all opportunities we can to have quite robust discussions. These discussions can sometimes be shut down by interlocutors from overseas who say that we are questioning their way of life and are not sensitive, culturally and possibly religiously, to what is part and parcel of the way of life there. As you know, I am Muslim by faith. In many ways, I use the fact that I do not carry the baggage of any of that so as not to feel that I am back-footed on any of this. I have been quite robust in challenging some of these practices, which are usually quite distorted interpretations, even of the faith that they profess to represent. One of the things that we have been incredibly strong on and have made a priority is freedom of religionand belief, and of practices that follow from that. Certainly from my own experience I can assure you that it is something we take incredibly seriously. One of the discussions I have had with Zainab Bangura is about how, interestingly, it appears that it is some of the most non-permissive societies, where sexual relations between people are not allowed outside of marriage, that allow the most awful form of sexual abuse. Opening up that conversation with certain parts of the world is certainly something that I am keen to take forward. Q132 Chris White: Good morning, Minister. What were the key outcomes of the G8 Foreign Ministers' meeting on 10 and 11 April, regarding violence against women and girls? Baroness Warsi: First, it identied rape and sexual violence as a grave breach of the Geneva convention, and that leads to specic requirements around arrest, prosecution and criminalisation of an offence. So the G8 countries obliged themselves in a completely different way to the way in which sexual violence is seen at the moment. They also agreed to take forward an international protocol on investigating and documenting sexual offences. One of the challenges of getting a prosecution is making sure that the quality of the evidence and the way in which it is collected and documented is strong enough to be presented in a court of law, and that cases do not fail when they get to that point. Having an international protocol will, I think, equalise practices. There is also a specic agreement that, where amnesties are granted after a conflict as part of a peace agreement, there is no amnesty for sexual violence. It is not one of those things that can be traded off for a greater peace, because we fundamentally believe that there cannot be peace without justice, especially justice for victims of sexual crimes. We are also looking at how we can build capacity into our own armed forces, so that they know what levels of conduct are required in-country, how to identify sexual violence, and how, when working alongside peacekeepers from other countries, to make sure that people are properly trained and do not become part of the perpetration of this crime themselves. As I mentioned to Fiona, there is of course the issue of providing security for women in the rst phase of a conflict or a humanitarian response, including protection measures such as separate bathing facilities and toilets. We are incredibly pleased with the outcome of this. These are the G8 nations effectively turning around and saying, \"Yes, we take it seriously. Yes, we are going to do something about it,\" and putting a path in place as to how we can get there. It is not going to happen over night. People who have been involved in this area now for many years\u2014like many of you here\u2014will know that it is going to take a huge political push. What you can be assured of is that the Foreign Secretary, the Foreign and Commonwealth Ofce and this Government are taking this incredibly seriously and are at the forefront of that political push.Ev 44 International Development Committee: Evidence 9 May 2013 Baroness Warsi, Emma Hopkins and Louise de Sousa Q133 Chris White: Thank you. You have made very clear your perspective and the UK Government's perspective on this issue. How do you see other countries responding\u2014G8 countries in particular? Baroness Warsi: I think the fact that we have G8 agreement on this, and the fact that it is going to be back on the G85agenda in June, shows that it is something that other important, strong countries are taking forward. It is also interesting that sometimes this issue is seen as a women's issue and women speak incredibly passionately about it. One of the strong comments that I hear from many Foreign Ministers that I meet on my visits is that the fact that the Foreign Secretary, William Hague, has led on this makes it even more powerful. Indeed, many of the Foreign Ministers who will be taking this initiative forward in the G8 countries are men themselves. Strong male leadership within the G8 countries is going to be part of the basis for success. Q134 Jeremy Lefroy: Good morning, Minister. One of the key challenges with initiatives such as this is to keep things going once this year has gone past. How do you and how do the Government see this happening? Are there any other countries that have said they will take this up in the future and not just move on to other initiatives and leave this one behind? Baroness Warsi: The rst way we do it is carrying on with it and using every opportunity to keep raising it, and I think you can see that we are doing that. The Foreign Secretary has made it clear that he will absolutely make sure that this is a priority right to the end of this Government. We hope that whoever it is thereafter will carry on making it a priority. Hopefully, the matter will have been raised so far up the political agenda by then that it will just become an issue that people take forward. The Germans have said that when they chair the G8 they will take the matter forward, so again there is some continuity there. Introducing it within the United Nations General Assembly framework and having a high level political meeting in the margins of the General Assembly meeting in September will mean that other countries will be politically supporting it as well. Q135 Jeremy Lefroy: And specically with the UK Government, what plans are there in the FCO and\u2014 if you are able to speak about this\u2014DFID for making sure that this continues? Baroness Warsi: I know that you are hearing from Lynne Featherstone later on, and it may well be that she can go into detail about the plans within DFID. The interesting part of the PSVI programme is that a series of Departments across Government were involved in its developmental stage, including the Department for International Development, the Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of Justice, the Attorney-General's Ofce and the Cabinet Ofce. So across Government, a lot of people have invested time and energy in the initiative itself. Lynne 5Footnote by witness: G8 Declaration on Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict adopted 11 April.Featherstone6is the international champion in taking it forward. She leads on all aspects of violence against women and girls, and has been hugely involved in the PSVI programme. In fact, she and the Foreign Secretary will do things as alternatives as well. In terms of taking the matter forward, a lot of the programmes that may come out of the conflict pool7are held by the stabilisation unit, which, again, comprises the MOD, the FCO and DFID. I am condent that there is enough buy-in across Government Departments for this to carry on and be supported. Q136 Jeremy Lefroy: You raised the question of the involvement of the peacekeepers and the MOD. It seems that the MOD, post-Afghanistan, will spend more of its time and resources on peacekeeping and training of peacekeepers, which I welcome. We already have missions in East Africa, for instance, and in Nairobi. Are you aware of the work that they are doing to increase the training of their own personnel in this? Baroness Warsi: I am not aware of specic work, but I am aware that one of the themes that has come out of the PSVI programme and, more recently, the G8 statement is proper training of peacekeeping missions, because there have been occasions when the peacekeeping forces themselves have become perpetrators. They need to be trained to identify sexual violence and to know what to do when they identify it and who they pass it back to in terms of documentation. Like you say, it is positive for us to be involved in training the troops who do the peacekeeping. Q137 Pauline Latham: What are your reflections on the outcomes of the Commission on the Status of Women? Hindsight is a wonderful thing. A lot of good came out of it, but some things were missing. What would you do differently if you had your time again\u2014 or what would the UK Government do differently? Baroness Warsi: The negotiations and the political lobbying that led to the consensus document in March of this year were a huge success. The theme of the document was the elimination of all forms of violence against women. The last time that that theme was discussed was in 2003, and at the end of it, no agreement could be reached. Ten years on, we felt that the same kind of challenges that were being presented in 2003 were being presented again. There was huge sensitivity around the issues of reproductive health and emergency contraception. Certain countries felt that they endorsed sexual behaviour that was not 6Footnote by witness: In Lynne Featherstone's role as Ministerial Champion for Tackling Violence Against Women and Girls Overseas, she supports the Foreign Secretary's Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative (PSVI) 7Footnote by witness: The Conflict Pool is a separate Treasury funding allocation (\u00a3229m in FY13/14), managed and implemented jointly by the FCO, MOD and DFID. In line with the Building Stability Overseas Strategy it aims to prevent conflict in countries and regions of particular importance to the UK through ve regional and one thematic programme and an Early Action Facility for unforeseen needs in-year. The Pool also funds the tri-departmental Stabilisation Unit, which leads on the UK government's stabilisation work in conflict-affected countries.International Development Committee: Evidence Ev 45 9 May 2013 Baroness Warsi, Emma Hopkins and Louise de Sousa considered to be appropriate, so there were huge political and cultural challenges to try to get an agreement. Where the Foreign Ofce was at its best was getting the plan up front as to who needed to be lobbied, when they needed to be lobbied, how we would keep that lobbying effort up and which were the right people to press the buttons. Right through to the end, there were frantic conversations going on about picking up phones to people\u2014interlocutors whom I knew well. I know Justine Greening did a tremendous job in the way in which she lobbied personally and consistently to get agreement on this. We have now got an agreement. It might not be perfect, but it is a very good and a strong focal point. It gives us a reference point to say to countries, \"You have agreed this now and we need to start seeing implementation.\" If we implement what we have an agreement on, it would go a long way towards protecting women and girls. Q138 Pauline Latham: That leads me on to ask about the next steps that you are going to take to improve and make life better for women and girls. Baroness Warsi: The agreement provides us with a reference point. What we now do in our conversations, lobbying and programmes that we fund, is go back and say, \"Your country has agreed to this, so you now need to start to implement this.\" That could be in the form of doing specic work around individual countries' national action plans, for example. In Afghanistan one of the strong things I have been saying is, \"You have agreed to certain things. You have got an action plan in place. You now need to implement it.\" As you are probably aware, many countries are great at getting the shiny document that says what they are going to do. They don't particularly do what the shiny document says. Our role in the FCO is to use the opportunities we get with access to these people to hold their feet to the re and have a level of accountability. Again in Afghanistan, I consistently referred to the Tokyo agreement and the framework around it. Through our political messaging\u2014again in Afghanistan, for example\u2014we can constantly say that we will not allow the gains that have been made in relation to women's rights to slip back. We can just send that message and say that the commitments we have made for the future support of Afghanistan are very much linked to them doing their side of the deal as well. That includes their progress on women's rights. Q139 Pauline Latham: There are key things, such as no protection for sex workers. We all know that every country has sex workers; it is not as though it is a surprise to anybody. Obviously, there were key countries that did not want to include that. There is also the matter of intimate partner violence. There is no language agreed on sexual orientation and gender identity. Do you feel that those are things that in the next round\u2014or whenever the next meetings are\u2014 might be pushed back?We are told that Iran, Russia and Syria are not keen on that\u2014you might not be surprised\u2014but nor is the Vatican. Do you think the fact that we have a new Pope is relevant? I can't remember if he was in place then, but even so, he is very new to the job so he would not have had much influence on views at that meeting. Do you think that with the new Pope we might move forward a bit? Baroness Warsi: I am not sure. As you are probably aware, I have a strong relationship with the Holy See and the Vatican and had the privilege to be at the inauguration ceremony. I hope that the relationship that was probably taken to a new level with the last papal visit will continue, and we will be able to have, as a result of that stronger relationship, some of these tougher conversations. Politics is the art of the possible. Sometimes we have to accept that we do not get everything we want, provided we can get what is possible. The fact is that we have a consensus agreement on some incredibly difcult and sensitive issues. We know how hard ofcials worked across all Departments. I saw close up how hard they worked in the FCO to get the agreement. If we can take forward what we have agreed and can achieve off the back of it, that is a focus point for getting further agreement on more sensitive issues. There is no point getting agreement on something that you know is never going to be implemented, or losing agreement because there is something you want that is even more sensitive. It is not perfect and we will keep trying. The fact that it took a decade to get agreement on some of these issues reflects how challenging these conversations are in the international forums. Q140 Chair: May I press you a little further on Afghanistan? You know that in our report on Afghanistan we asked for a much higher priority to be given to women's rights. Indeed, DFID responded to that by pushing it up the agenda. On the peacekeeping point, we are training the Afghan army and police. Are you satised that that kind of training will lead to better conduct and behaviour? As you rightly say, the perpetration of violence by police and armed forces is often a problem. We have not heard of serious problems, but can you give us any guidance on whether you feel that is taking root? Baroness Warsi: In Afghanistan, the issue of sexual violence does not just relate to women. Tragically, it also relates to boys and men, which is very much a taboo issue. At one of the round tables that I hosted on my last visit a few months ago, we specically brought up the issue of sexual violence directed towards young boys, who predominantly have access to places where there are security forces. Purely because of the nature of the society, fewer women are in exposed places, but there is a huge amount of violence within the home. Therefore, we have been working with Afghanistan to put in place the necessary legislation and to deal with the issue of domestic violence and violence within the home. The training, of course, focuses on issues around sexual violence. One of the ways in which we think we can challenge it is by having more female policeEv 46 International Development Committee: Evidence 9 May 2013 Baroness Warsi, Emma Hopkins and Louise de Sousa ofcers. When I was last in Helmand, I went to see a police station where they had female police ofcers. I met four or ve female police ofcers, and they said that their work had been incredibly challenging. They are still seen as a target by certain groups within Afghanistan, but they do have the support of their superiors. That support and leadership makes their jobs easier. We are also increasing the number of family response units, which look, for example, at the issue of violence within homes. But it is an incredibly difcult and conservative society, and these things are going to take time. Where I think the involvement of women will be crucial is their involvement in the peace and reconciliation process. Gains could be lost if, in the reconciliation process, demands around the rights of women are forgone to get the wider peace. I don't think you will get peace if we give up on those demands. Therefore, having women on the High Peace Council, which is the main body that will negotiate with the Taliban in the peace and reconciliation process, is important. There was a suggestion that one of the demands made at the negotiations with the Taliban and the High Peace Council was not to have women present at those meetings. That is the kind of thing that we can politically push back on. If you take those issues off the table, how do we know they are going to be raised? You cannot silence the voices that are part of this process. We need a lot more inter-parliamentary work. Having female parliamentarians visiting here has been good, and I think that empowers them and supports them as well. I always host discussions with female parliamentarians when I go to Afghanistan. We fund and support the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission, which works within Afghanistan. Its Chair, Sima Samar, is a phenomenal woman. This is a very personal anecdote. In the age of Twitter, so many of us and so many of our interlocutors from across the world are on Twitter. Direct messaging is a phenomenally powerful tool for bringing these abuses to light incredibly quickly when they start to happen. I take great comfort from one of the female Members of Parliament whom I met in Afghanistan, who said, \"Look, it can never go back to the way it was under the Taliban, because we all have mobile phones, and we can all get on Facebook and Twitter and talk to each other without having to go outside the home.\" There is a real ght now in the women in Afghanistan. We have just got to make sure that we give them support and say we will ght alongside them. Chair: We certainly met some of those very feisty parliamentarians. Q141 Fiona O'Donnell: You rightly highlighted how important it is that we have a joined-up approach across different Government Departments to violence against women and girls. I wonder whether you can give us a bit of detail about how that process is managed. When did you last sit down with Lynne Featherstone and the appropriate Minister from the MOD to talk about that joined-up approach? Baroness Warsi: There is an inter-ministerial working group on violence against women and girls. It last metin February of this year. Lynne Featherstone attended, and I had a senior ofcial8attend that meeting. We also have discussions regularly on the National Action Plan, which is held on a cross-Government basis. I think Lynne's role is really pivotal to this. She is the person who has tentacles in all the different Departments. When you hear from her later, I think you will be convinced about how joined up this is, both in the preparation and the execution of programmes. The PSVI team includes the FCO, DFID and the Home Ofce. DFID has seconded somebody into the PSVI team, so at an ofcial level we are connected. In terms of the Commission on the Status of Women, the Government Equalities Ofce, the FCO and DFID are taking forward the agreed conclusions from that. So there is a whole amount of joined-up working on that agenda. Again, from a foreign policy perspective, show and tell is much more powerful than telling alone\u2014when we meet interlocutors and can show them what we are doing domestically on issues. Every country is always learning about how it can protect women better. We have had domestic debates on how to get more prosecutions for rape and on the support we can give to victims through that process. Having that joined-up working allows us to be much more powerful when we have international discussions. Q142 Chair: Earlier, you mentioned your involvement in domestic issues relating to FGM, and we have taken evidence from both interest groups and the police. The concern we have, rst, is on the number of women and girls who are at risk within the UK. There is evidence that cutting is taking place in the UK, yet no prosecutions have been taken forward. Do you have any thoughts or comments? It is exactly the point you have just made, because if we are going around the world saying that it should not happen when it is happening here in the UK and yet nothing\u2014 I am not saying nothing is being done about it, but there is no visible evidence of it\u2014it undermines our credibility, doesn't it? Baroness Warsi: Where we have had real success is in the area of forced marriages. Where we have had less success is on FGM. Of course, it concerns me, as it concerns the Home Secretary, that further progress has not been made on FGM. Part of that, going back, is that you can create a law but it is about the implementation of that law and making sure that we have community support, too. A lot of these practices happen in very closed communities, and we need to have support from people within those communities who are prepared to come forward and give evidence that allows prosecutions to happen. The way to get that is by tackling the culture. With my domestic hat on, I have a brief in the Department for Communities and Local Government on faith and communities. One element of our integration brief is about challenging those practices that are sometimes overlooked in the name of sensitivity by being prepared to say to people that there is a certain set of universal values to which 8Footnote by witness: FCO Minsters and senior ofcials regularly attend the inter-ministerial group however no ofcial from the FCO attended the February meeting.International Development Committee: Evidence Ev 47 9 May 2013 Baroness Warsi, Emma Hopkins and Louise de Sousa people should join up. We will openly and publicly challenge those practices and get communities to stand alongside us when we challenge them. It is about cultural change and getting the community to work alongside us, and hopefully have people who are brave enough to come forward. I agree with you that more needs to be done. I know it is something that Examination of Witnesses Witnesses: Lynne Featherstone MP , Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, DFID, Jo Moir, Acting Head, Conflict, Humanitarian and Security Department, DFID and Jen Marshall, Head of Profession for Social Development, gave evidence. Q143 Chair: Good morning. It is nice to see you again. For the record, although those of us who are long at the Department have met them already, would you introduce your team? Lynne Featherstone: Perhaps they could introduce themselves. Jen Marshall: Good morning. I am Jen Marshall, the Head of Profession for Social Development at DFID, so I lead the technical team that delivers a lot of this work on the ground. Jo Moir: I am Jo Moir, the Acting Head of the Conflict, Humanitarian and Security Department, where the team works on violence against women and girls. Q144 Chair: As you know, this inquiry is ranging quite widely. We just had Baroness Warsi before us to give us her take on both Foreign Ofce and cross- departmental working. She made a number of references to you, Lynne, as being the key co- ordinator or player across the Departments. I know that you do it on Twitter as well as other places, but you make some pretty strong pledges on Violence Against Women and Girls and how you are going to take that work forward. Practically and specically, what can you do now within the Department really to advance the claims into substantive policy and delivery? Lynne Featherstone: Actually, I think it was brilliant, in terms of violence against women, to have the champion situated in DFID as opposed to the Home Ofce, because prior to that it was the MOD, the FCO and DFID that funded the role over at the Home Ofce. A very good example of what I can do in DFID would be that the theme of the UN Commission on the Status of Women earlier this year was violence against women, so I was aware that there is a rise in countries across the world that think that women should be put back in their box and that it was going to be difcult to get agreed conclusions. I arrived at DFID saying that we have to do something and that we have to start early. There followed six months of unremitting work, with me and the Secretary of State phoning and lobbying across the world, so that when we came to the ght and the negotiation we could get agreed conclusions, which had not happened 10 years earlier. That is one example of being in situ. Of course, the previous Secretary of State put women and girls right at the heart of DFID in development terms, but in terms of violence against women fourLynne, the Home Secretary and many others take incredibly seriously, and we hope we can make progress on it. Chair: Thank you very much. I hope your rst appearance in front of a Select Committee has not been too traumatic. From our point of view, it has been revealing and very interesting. pillars have always made up the strategic vision: delay rst pregnancy and support safe childbirth; improve economic opportunities; get girls through primary and secondary school; and prevent violence. That fourth pillar is now scaling up to an unprecedented level. We are working in 20 country programmes and it is being mainstreamed through virtually everything that DFID does in every department. It is embedded in DFID's structure and in the staff who work there and in the resource that can facilitate it across the world. I would like to think that it had something of a galvanising effect, and the Secretary of State is an equally enthusiastic supporter of this agenda. We are now moving on to things such as the Call To Action, and I am sure that you have a whole range of questions. Q145 Chair: Many of us have met your team and we had a good meeting and exchange of views. It is a small team, however, and you were talking about outsourcing some services. On a practical organisational basis, do you feel that your team is strong enough? How do you get the balance between in-house and outsourcing to ensure that you get the repower you need? Lynne Featherstone: We judge that we now have the necessary capacity really to address violence against women and girls. The team structure itself is being looked at in the terms of those new priorities that I just described. All of the country ofces are considering their capacity to deliver as programmes evolve and have this agenda at their heart. We have senior input from a gender champion\u2014Joy is the champion for Africa\u2014from a policy director and from the head of CHASE. Different members of the gender team lead support as necessary. There are social development advisers, who are the key ofcials who ensure that that is embedded, virtually everywhere. We give guidance and support to country ofces. In terms of the outsourcing, we are setting up a support desk and that will facilitate as needed, where needed. It is a ne judgment, but it is a very good thing to have this expert, flexible body that is there to provide whatever we need wherever we need it, and not just buy everything in at the right time with the right expertise. In a sense, it is also a time saver, but we will keep an eye on it to make sure it actually delivers what we want of it. If we nd that an outsourced facility does not suit the purpose for which we employed that body, we will review that.Ev 48 International Development Committee: Evidence 9 May 2013 Lynne Featherstone MP , Jo Moir and Jen Marshall Q146 Chair: Perhaps specic examples would help. We as a Committee were very much focused on this agenda in Afghanistan. If you remember, we basically said the test of UK engagement in Afghanistan would be the state of the women after the troops have left and in the years beyond. I believe that you have now got a much more targeted approach in Afghanistan. In countries such as Afghanistan, the DRC\u2014we are all concerned about what goes on there\u2014Sudan and Somalia, particularly in relation to FGM as well as the violence in general, how are you focusing down to ensure that these issues really do become central to the programmes within those countries? I think I speak for the Committee when I say that the status of women in those countries will be a real litmus test of whether they are coming out of conflict and into civilised development. Lynne Featherstone: My ofcials may jump in if they want with specic examples. Because the absolute focus of DFID is on the poorest countries, inevitably those are the countries where women are the poorest and also suffer the most violence. In all the countries you mentioned we have a scale-up of programmes. Rather than my going through programmes, I will ask if either of my ofcials want to contribute while I look up which programmes. I visited some myself in Sudan and in Ethiopia. I will let you do the actual programmes, because I have been to so many. You are looking for the construct as to how we approach those. Q147 Chair: We wanted to see how the programmes are being adapted to take this as you push it up the agenda. Jen Marshall: Perhaps I can give you an example from Afghanistan. I was recently there; I followed the IDC in. That is a good example of where the Secretary of State made a public commitment. It was a commitment that reflected a discussion that had been going on for a while about this being a real priority, part of that work across the Afghanistan programme to think about how we can further increase our work to support gender equality in Afghanistan, whether that is through girls' education, women's empowerment, political leadership and so on. But we knew that we needed to do more on V AWG, so we were really pleased that the Secretary of State made that commitment on 4 March as part of her international women's day speech. In the programme, there is a process now going on of looking across the portfolio, and looking at what may be needed in terms of a stand-alone programme and what is needed to integrate V AWG into existing work. So there was a political commitment and recognition that this is the key issue, and then a real team effort between social development advisers and also governance and conflict advisers and others across programmes. There is a need to integrate elements of work on violence . We recognise in Afghanistan that we do need to do more, and the team are actively working on that across different areas. In the other countries, it is similar. Technical advisers will be doing the analysis, and where there is a very high prevalence of violence they will have this on the agenda when they are programming and thinking about what they should be doing to address it. Theywill be working out the best way, bearing in mind the context and what other donors are doing in that country. They will recognise what is possible and where we can have leverage and can really make a change. We are seeing really important progress across all those countries you refer to, particularly those with high prevalence, including Somalia and elsewhere. Lynne Featherstone: I just came back from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. I visited a War Child place where girls who have been living on the street, because they have been violated or thrown out by their families, are facing incredible levels of sexual violence. We are looking at how we can integrate that into our programmes. There is a whole range of work going on in terms of how we can scale up\u2014quite dramatically, I think. Q148 Pauline Latham: It is good that you mentioned the DRC because I am concerned about what is going on there, particularly the violence against women and girls by the forces. The UN seem to be doing nothing at all about it. You said you have met with War Child and it is going to be integrated and all this jargon. What actually is going to happen? How is it going to affect the girl in the DRC who is on the streets now? What are you going to do that will make a big difference to her life? You can integrate and you can do all this jargon, but what does it mean on the ground? Lynne Featherstone: On the ground, if that programme goes ahead, it will mean that there will be somewhere where a girl will be able to go. There will be someone who will be able to teach her skills. It is occasionally an overnight refuge, the War Child one. So it is looking at what services and what skills you can give so that there is an economic opportunity for that girl to get away. When everyone goes to the DRC they go to the east. I went to the Kasai-Occidental, which is the poorest state in the world, to look at what they are doing. There is a programme there that we are scaling up called the police de proximit\u00e9. It is basically enabling community policing. In the training we are looking at all of those issues around sexual violence. It is about who will be listening to those girls and how they will access justice. So the access to justice programmes are huge as well. There are so many to talk about. The difference for women and girls in one of the provinces where we have three pilots going on is that they will have a police force that is trained to understand that they are there to protect women, not to rape them, which will be a move forward. Q149 Pauline Latham: Aren't the police supposed to be doing that anyway? Lynne Featherstone: Well, that is what I said. It will be a move forward because in many of these countries\u2014certainly in Ethiopia, if girls on the university campus who were being sexually harassed or subjected to violence from male students or teachers went to the police point, which is on every campus, they were as likely to be raped or hurt by the police themselves. So there is quite a job to do in terms of police training. You move forward in theInternational Development Committee: Evidence Ev 49 9 May 2013 Lynne Featherstone MP , Jo Moir and Jen Marshall direction, but you are absolutely right: that is the kind of thing you are up against in these countries where none of the authorities are really doing what we would expect from them in this country. Quite frankly, it is only about 30 years since they weren't really taking domestic violence seriously in this country. Q150 Pauline Latham: You are talking about War Child. That is a charity. Are DFID funding that charity to do this work? Lynne Featherstone: No. That is why I went to see it to look at what DFID could do along those lines, because there are so many girls who nd themselves ejected on the streets and have no protection and nowhere to go. They are very vulnerable to violence. Q151 Pauline Latham: So at the moment are we still looking? We have not made any decisions. We are not actually changing the lives of any of those girls. Lynne Featherstone: Not of those I saw at War Child. But we are changing many other girls' lives. Jo Moir: Might I say a little bit more about the DRC programme? Obviously the rates of violence against women and girls in that country are horrendous. Access to women and girls in those situations is incredibly difcult. It is a conflict situation in many parts of the country. So one of the main routes in to providing help to women and girls is through our humanitarian programming. We work in a number of ways through a number of agencies to try and prevent violence against women and girls in the camps and so on before it happens, but also to respond through the provision of services through our humanitarian programming. In terms of tackling violence against women and girls at the systemic level, the Minister referenced our security and justice programme in the DRC, where we are investing \u00a34 million to try to train the police so that they can investigate crimes of sexual violence more effectively and are not contributing to the problem in perhaps the way they have done in the past. Those are just a couple of examples where we are working in the DRC. Q152 Pauline Latham: Until the UN have a mandate that says they can hold somebody who they know has been a perpetrator of violence or sexual violence against women and girls, until they can hold them until the police arrive\u2014presumably the police by now are trained\u2014it still will not affect anybody. In these war situations, by the time the police arrive, the perpetrators have disappeared. You have to start higher up. You have to start by saying that the UN must be able to hold on to these people until such time as the police\u2014fully trained so that they don't rape and abuse women themselves\u2014come, and then they get into the justice system. You can't have access to justice unless you have got the perpetrators, and that is not happening at the moment. Lynne Featherstone: I think there is a recognition that sexual violence, and violence against women and girls\u2014and children, for that matter\u2014in humanitarian situations, is not working at the moment. There are two things, really: I held a round table with a lot of the violence against women NGOs, and one of thethings that clearly came up, to me, was that in the camps where many of these women end up there really is no protection. The Secretary of State has now called for action on sexual violence in humanitarian situations; I think there is a big event\u2014conference\u2014in the autumn. One of the things I am particularly stressed about is that we have come from a position, if you like, where in humanitarian situations there has always been food, shelter, water, sanitation; and there is in my view a requirement for a rst order position to cover violence, sexual violence, against women and children in those camps\u2014because it is perpetrated from day one, and it is actually an opportunity, where you have a lot of people together. In fact last night, Zainab Bangura was talking about Somalia, where there are 510 of these camps, and we had a long discussion about how most of the sexual violence against women is actually taking place in what could be a controlled situation; so I think there is an opportunity there. The issue you raise is part of that whole agenda, which I think is now going to be grabbed hold of as, in a sense, a missing part of the puzzle of how you deal, from conflict to justice. Q153 Fiona Bruce: You mentioned the country ofces and the plans. There is a new round of country operational plans for DFID in 2015, so we are interested to know how you will ensure that strategic priorities include violence against women and are embedded and integrated into those plans. Lynne Featherstone: I think it would be very strange for anyone to be sending me an operational plan that did not include how that would be integrated. I think there has been a very clear strategic steer from both myself and the Secretary of State that we expect to see this totally across our programmes, so I think the message is out there in terms of ofcials understanding the priority we give it. Q154 Fiona Bruce: Thank you; that is very helpful. If I may drill down a little bit, and ask you about some countries where there is a high prevalence of violence against women and girls, you have given some good examples, or your colleague has, from the DRC, but can you give examples of plans for Somalia, South Sudan, Nigeria, Ethiopia and Pakistan? Lynne Featherstone: I would have to turn to my ofcials. South Sudan\u2014I went there, so I discussed the daily challenges and insecurity. For example, with women's groups in Yusuf Batil refugee camp, one of the programmes\u2014not the operational plan, but one of the programmes within the operational plan\u2014is about the stuff that erupts there. It is a programme of community action in terms of settling disputes. I haven't got Ethiopia on my list, so I ask my ofcials to say something if either of them have the specics on that\u2014in terms of the operational plans: I have got them in global form, but not in specics. Jen Marshall: I can give you a few examples from each of those countries. You mentioned Somalia, which has obviously been in the news, and at the forefront of our attention this week. DFID Somalia includes a range of activities on V AWG, I'll just give a couple of activities amidst wider work for genderEv 50 International Development Committee: Evidence 9 May 2013 Lynne Featherstone MP , Jo Moir and Jen Marshall equality. A key part of our humanitarian work includes specic work on referral units for women victims and survivors of violence. The DFID programme in Somalia includes a lot of work on governance, security and justice. That includes work to ensure that women get into the legal system\u2014that they are employed as barristers, so that they can tackle the systemic issues in the justice system\u2014and the police, so that they respond more effectively. In Nigeria, we have a programme that is in development amid a wide range of different investments for girls and women, including tackling conflict and promoting conflict prevention in the north. We put women and girls at the heart of how we think about conflict prevention in the north. The new programme in development at the moment is called \"V oices for Change\". It specically contains elements of tackling violence against women, including an important element of work on men and boys\u2014the role that they play and the change that they can bring about in Nigerian society. Pakistanis a good example of a DFID programme where V AWG has been integrated across a range of programmes, including those for conflict prevention and security, again working with the police, as Jo mentioned in DRC. They have a big programme called the Aawaz programme, which is about addressing the legislation and the community-level change that is required to change some of the norms on what is important, what drives violence and how you respond to it at the local level for women who need an immediate response. In Ethiopia, they are looking at what they can do more across the programme. They have, for a long time, had a strong focus on women and girls. An example there is \"Girl Hub\", which does some really good work to empower girls. A number of you visited the Amhara programme, which is tackling early marriage, the way it interrelates with violence and the way we can help girls to protect themselves and communities better to protect the girls in their communities. Lynne Featherstone: You asked an interesting question. When you look across all the operational plans, there is quite a lot going on. You would argue that some water and sanitation programmes prevent violence against women, because of the walk to and from. When you look through the 27 operational plans, all of them have programmes that educate women and provide them with skills in water and sanitation. In some of the programmes on access to justice, V AWG has not had the priority that it now has. That is being worked up. That bit is being scaled up to address what I think is one of the most prevalent problems and challenges in development. I do not think you can have development when half your population are unable to function because they are likely to be violated in one way or another. Q155 Fiona Bruce: So we can assume that this will have a much higher prole in the next round Fiona O'Donnell: interventions across different areas of workthat needed implementation to advance the work on violence against women and girls. Your own review of that and the evidence so far concentrate too much on political and institutional capacity. What work are you doing on the other three interventions to empower women and girls, change social norms and provide comprehensive services? Lynne Featherstone: I will start with social norms, because I think within changing social norms lies a lot of the answers to everything, in both the developed and developing worlds. Q157 Fiona O'Donnell: I understand the rationale. What are the interventions? Lynne Featherstone: Let us take female genital mutilation, which is probably one of the worst human rights abuses. The prevalence is high in many countries. Recently we announced up to \u00a335 million to be spent in four ways. The rst is a research programme to nd out what works best. Part of it is working directly with communities. The ambition is to achieve a reduction of 30% in 10 countries over ve years. It is also to galvanise a world movement. I purposefully announced it at CSW when all the key players in the FGM eld were there. There is a communication strategy to push it forward. The ambition is to end FGM within a generation. That is a massive ambition and one in which we have to engage the whole world, including the UK where we have a diaspora. It would be one example of something that has changed dramatically. Q158 Mr McCann: I have a few questions on DFID programmes. You mentioned the theory of change. Programming guidance on violence against women and girls stresses the importance of work and prevention, and creating that social change. We saw the programme in Ethiopia. It was making a real difference and starting to tackle some of the issues of child marriage and FGC. For example, in South Sudan I did not see great evidence that we were making inroads into the culture of female children being bartered for cattle, for example. Polygamy is rife. We met the governor of Cueibet, who had 14 wives and 62 children. Given that I never saw a lot of evidence on the ground that we were tackling those root causes, do you accept that we need to do more? Lynne Featherstone: Yes. Q159 Mr McCann: In those areas? Lynne Featherstone: Yes, but you could pick on any country and on any issue where we are not doing enough. At this point in time, we are doing some things in some countries some of the time. That is why we are having a cohesive look across the piece. We have not got on to the other three points that were asked about, but the one that has been less attended to has been the violence against women pillar. In South Sudan, apart from Access to Justice programming in camps and bits and pieces, there is not yet a cohesive programme. We can point to acid attacks in one country, and we can point to something in another country that we won't be doing. But I give you my assurance that we are working as fast as weInternational Development Committee: Evidence Ev 51 9 May 2013 Lynne Featherstone MP , Jo Moir and Jen Marshall can to scale up in a holistic way\u2014and an impact way\u2014in countries where we can do so. But I will take slight issue with you. It is important to have political engagement with male leaders in those countries. In a country like Afghanistan, for example, we can do all that we can do but ultimately, we are looking for male leadership because that is a country where, if there were no male leadership, at some point it won't have as much hold. We fund women's organisations. We engage with civil society so that it can hold its own Governments to account. I think that engaging at political level on that basis is tremendously important, and part of the work I have done as International Champion for tackling violence against women is the crafting of key messages for all of our travelling Ministers to take to any country whenever they have the opportunity. It is all very well having a champion, but I am one person. So to tackle violence against women across the world on my own is clearly\u2014as good as I am\u2014a ridiculous proposition. The rst key message is on leadership\u2014William Hague level, really, but for any travelling Minister to raise the issue of sexual violence and violence against women. The second order is where there are no laws, and to promote the institution of laws and where there are laws, their implementation. The third message is about the justice systems and the enforcement systems because, without police and justice, those things cannot be instituted. They are all quite nascent. We are looking at how to get such things into Ministers' programmes who are going on a whole range of things and when time is short. Such engagement is very important. Q160 Mr McCann: What plans are there to upscale? You mentioned it a few times, but can you give us a practical upscale and say how the work will prevail over the coming months and years? Lynne Featherstone: As I said, the point is that the operational plans for the countries are now being looked at and assessed. I expect them to come back to me for me to recommend to the Secretary of State, and I expect to see what their proposals are on the upscaling across all our operational plans. Q161 Chair: Have they been given a time scale for that? Have they got a particular target to bring these plans to you by a given time? Lynne Featherstone: There isn't one, but there is a refresh going on right now. I have just looked at the operational plans in terms of recommendations, and at the moment I am waiting for them to be clearer in terms of results. Q162 Mr McCann: But it is just the time scale and the implementation on the ground that we are trying to get to. Lynne Featherstone: I don't know. I don't have a time scale for when each one is coming to me\u2014I don't know if you do, Jo. Jo Moir: With the operational plans, as you probably know we refresh them on an annual basis but there will be a major overall of them as we come up to 2015. I think it is fair to say that in a range of different country programmes there are new Violence AgainstWomen and Girls programmes under development. Some of them stand alone and some of them are integrated into the health or education programmes, or the water and sanitation programmes. At the moment, the upscaling is already happening, as new programmes are being designed, published and implemented. There will be a major refresh of the operational plans in a couple of years' time. There are mini-refreshes going on at the moment. Ministers are looking at them, and I think they are being published sometime in June. Q163 Mr McCann: Do you think that's being complacent, when you say \"a couple of years' time\"? It worries me, if this is such a massive issue. Lynne Featherstone: It's not just that. Don't forget that a lot of our expenditure is planned expenditure and you have to develop things. You can't just take programmes away and take the money because as we get to 0.7% to the full extent there isn't new money coming forward. So we are looking at the whole\u2014 Q164 Pauline Latham: You are going up to 0.7%, so there is a lot of new money. Lynne Featherstone: No, but I am saying that it is all planned expenditure. At the moment, the discussions that are going on are around the business model, how much will be spent on an annual basis on what and where it is coming from. If it is going to go to violence against women, or something else, we have to look at where it is coming from. Q165 Pauline Latham: But isn't that one of the key priorities? We are doing a big jump. The Secretary of State has said that it is going to be right at the forefront and the previous Secretary of State was focusing on women and girls, so it is not new, but we have a huge increase in the amount of money from 0.5 whatever it was to 0.7%. That is an incredible increase, and you are saying, \"It's all committed.\" I am sorry, but it is not. Lynne Featherstone: Much of it is already committed on the violence against women agenda in terms of the programmes\u2014 Q166 Pauline Latham: But you can't give us any specics. You're not giving us any practical examples. Lynne Featherstone: Okay. DFID South Africa has a new programme strengthening South Africa's response to gender-based violence through prevention. That has a budget of \u00a34 million over four years, so there are many\u2014 Q167 Chair: Can you perhaps give us in writing a summary of the key programmes\u2014particularly in the countries most affected\u2014to know where it's at? Lynne Featherstone: We can send you a list of the programmes but there are lots of different programmes that have elements of violence against women, sexual violence, access to justice and prevention work with men and boys. Q168 Chair: I mean in presentational terms. I will give you the example of what we did on Afghanistan.Ev 52 International Development Committee: Evidence 9 May 2013 Lynne Featherstone MP , Jo Moir and Jen Marshall We said that we thought the issue of the status of women\u2014not just violence but right across the piece\u2014 was central to development in Afghanistan. We know what our report said, yet when we looked at the programme there was very little evidence that women's issues and gender issues were prioritised and the recommendation was that that should happen. The implication we are getting is that that effectively is happening. It would be helpful if we could get a similar kind of view, on particularly the most affected countries, of what the programmes were\u2014 Lynne Featherstone: So Somalia, Ethiopia, Sudan and South Sudan. Q169 Chair: I think it would help us to understand the dynamic. Lynne Featherstone: I am happy to do that. I can give you the list that we are doing in Afghanistan if that is helpful. We have them in every country, and I am happy to supply those programmes. What I am talking about in terms of the refresh in 2015 is that there will be quite a shift, I imagine, in terms of looking at the whole of what DFID does and how that is programmed. Q170 Fiona O'Donnell: May I just say, Minister, that perhaps a good starting point would be to say to country programmes that there is a time scale within which they must respond with their plans, rather than allowing this to drift without an end date. Lynne Featherstone: It is not exactly drift. They are coming up with new programmes all the time, and the shift is towards violence against women and also women's empowerment and all of those issues. It is not a stop-start thing; the programming evolves the whole time as opportunities arise. It is about either working with Governments or despite Governments\u2014 it depends on the circumstances of the country. Those submissions and those business cases are coming up all the time. Q171 Mr McCann: We took evidence from one of the elders on this topic. It was really worrying and disturbing to hear that, even now at the UN, countries are arguing that culture should still trump human rights. In terms of your research and innovation fund and the evidence that that generates about what works in trying to effect social change, can you give us a little bit of detail about how that will work? If something works in one country, it is crucial that we can roll that out and learn from the experience. Lynne Featherstone: We have written new guidance on community-level programming, and that is being disseminated. The social development advisers are the keys to that in terms of taking what works in one country. Some \u00a35 million of the Research and Innovation Fund is going to explore what those things are and take them further. Even at the moment, we have guidance. Up to \u00a325 million for the V AWG Research and Innovation Fund has been approved. As I have said, there is a \u00a335 million fund for FGM and the new V AWG help desk, which is the outsource function that you referred to earlier. All of those things are to do with what you said about taking what works. We should not assume that what works in onecountry will necessarily work in another. We must understand best practice. I went to Senegal\u2014I was at the Home Ofce before DFID and had domestic violence in my portfolio. I would stand at the Dispatch Box at every session of oral questions, and everyone would ask, \"Why have we got no prosecutions on FGM here?\" There is a whole raft of answers to that. I had heard about the work going on in west Africa, and a few weeks ago I went to see it. That, I would say, is a model for social change. It happens to be the one I have seen, and you cannot assume that what you have seen is the only thing that works. What I saw in Senegal might not work in Ethiopia, Sudan or Somalia where we have FGM programmes. But what I saw was a community with a nearly three- year programme on human rights. That three-year programme was focused not on FGM specically, but on what the whole village wanted. It was called the human rights programme. They worked with the whole village: the elders, the religious leaders, the men, the women\u2014and the children, because quite often children are not allowed to speak in front of their elders. Over that time, they did a whole range of things, which we would recognise as how a community works. They decided on their focus. They had drawn pictures. What the community wanted to do that year was buy a cow; there were targets, if you like. The community had also decided on the abandonment of FGM; they do that as a community and it is they who decide that they are going to do it. Then they stand and make a public declaration. Some 6,000 communities have done that. In terms of social norms and change, you cannot get anything more deeply embedded than FGC as a practice over 2,000 years. It cuts across everything\u2014the cultural eggshells and all those people who say that they cannot do it\u2014because it is decided by the community themselves. Part of the issue is to do with information. No connection had been made between the cutting and the serious health consequences that were being experienced by girls and women later on in life. Once they recognised the harm, they decided that they did not want to go on effecting a harmful practice. The religious leaders came to conrm that it was not a religious requirement. They worked as a community. What I saw there\u2014forgetting FGM for a moment\u2014 was that something had happened in terms of the relationship between men and women. The committees that had formed had men and women on them, and women had an equal say with men. Women spoke up all the time, as did children, so there was a shift from what had been. I was still sitting with the men\u2014let us not get too excited\u2014and the women were in the side panels of this discussion group, with a couple of hundred people there. Nevertheless, there was quite a shift in the way they did stuff. That was a living example, in front of my eyes, that demonstrated how social norms, with all the challenges that you raise around cultural imperialism, can shift, but it has to be long-term and internalised and to come from the people themselves\u2014in this case, African-led\u2014with our being there just to support a timely change in the world and particularly in Africa.International Development Committee: Evidence Ev 53 9 May 2013 Lynne Featherstone MP , Jo Moir and Jen Marshall Somewhere in all that lies the answer to many of the problems of violence against women. Whether you look at PSVI, with rape as a weapon of war, or violence to girls on the street, in all those situations\u2014 in camps or just in villages, as much as in urban settings\u2014women get it wherever. That is an attitudinal issue, so I am very keen on looking at the psychology behind that, in terms of trying to effect long-term change, so it is a personal hobby-horse, obviously. Q172 Mr McCann: You have neatly touched on my next question. Some of these cultures, as you rightly point out, have been in communities for thousands of years, so it is a slow-burn issue to try to effect that change. Of course, DFID is under the microscope, having one of the few budgets that is actually increasing, given these difcult economic times. Is there a recognition within DFID, which is a results- based industry, that investment has to continue; that, although we will not necessarily see immediate results, long-term investment has to go in to effect the change; and that it is not going to turn around and say, \"Oh, we haven't seen any change, we're going to stop funding it\"? Lynne Featherstone: I think that having a results- based focus\u2014value for money for the British taxpayer\u2014is absolutely super-important, but you cannot measure everything. I am more than happy to go out and defend an investment for the long term. Right across all countries, one of the problems for all politicians is having to show short-term results. Particularly in the environment of having a protected budget\u2014so our responsibility is even greater\u2014you can go out and make the argument for our work being investment for the long term. There has been an incredible shift in the world in terms of the reduction of overall poverty. It is nowhere near there, but in the focus of the millennium development goals and the focus on alleviating poverty\u2014that remains the focus\u2014we have seen change. Not all of that was measurable; much of it was technical advice to Governments. There are myriad things that you cannot measure, but those long-term internal changes will actually deliver a different future. Q173 Mr McCann: My nal question is about women's organisations, which have been touched on in answers to previous questions. The Theory of Change highlights the key role that women on organisations play as catalysts for change. Yet, in terms of DFID's funding arrangements, it appears that there is little scope to reward those organisations by giving them money. Are there any plans to change the funding mechanisms? Lynne Featherstone: We do give quite a lot of money to civil society organisations. I think it was about \u00a31 billion this year. Obviously, we support BOND. Q174 exaggerate. We fund centrally through a number of mechanisms or through multilateral programmes. Obviously, weare big supporters of UN Women in particular. Now that it is getting it more together, it is becoming quite a mover and shaker, as you would hope, in terms of catalytic advice across the world. We do accountable grants, such as the acid burns survivors programmes. Country ofces have a small budget to give small grants to local NGOs, because we obviously want to build capacity within countries to hold their own Governments to account, and to lobby and ght for things. For example, in Afghanistan we fund Tawanmandi, and in Bangladesh the Manusher Jonno Foundation, and we support social inclusion action programmes. Local ofces look at where their grants would be best given. They are also supported by engagement with our country ofces. We sometimes forget and assume everyone has the same capacity or knowledge which just does not exist in some of the places where we work. So our local ofces are best placed to judge how to support and build the capacity in local civil society. Q175 Pauline Latham: You talked about the Theory of Change and earlier on you talked about health, education, water and sanitation. Can you tell us a little bit about the detail of how DFID plans to work on violence against women through those programmes? We know that girls are abused on the way to school, collecting water, collecting rewood, going to use latrines that are not separate from boys' latrines. So what are DFID doing? Lynne Featherstone: In terms of our WASH programmes or the multilaterals that we fund through WASH, I saw one in the DRC where I visited a spring which we have enabled a village to have. So the women no longer have to walk for hours every day. It is about 10 minutes there and 10 minutes back now. So obviously that is a protection. They also have sanitation but within an enclosed area, so they don't have to go and nd places to defecate in the forest. Q176 Pauline Latham: So do they have proper latrines? Lynne Featherstone: Yes, they have proper latrines. By our standards they are not the same\u2014 Pauline Latham: But separate ones for men and women, not shared? Lynne Featherstone: I don't know the answer to that for the ones I saw. I didn't ask that question. I just visited the latrines that had been built, but I did not ask whether they were for different genders. Jen Marshall: Standard practice is that they would be separated. Q177 Pauline Latham: I was going to say. That is pretty key. You went to see something like that and you didn't know whether the sanitation was separate. One of the key things that we talk about is that girls can go to the toilet privately and not be hassled by men. Lynne Featherstone: I must have gone to the girls' one. Q178 Pauline Latham: You must have done? Okay. Can you tell me whether DFID are going to issue specic guidance on working on violence againstEv 54 International Development Committee: Evidence 9 May 2013 Lynne Featherstone MP , Jo Moir and Jen Marshall women in the sectors we have talked about? How will you make sure that the sectoral advisers have adequate knowledge of violence against women and girls? Which staff members are responsible for mainstreaming violence against women and girls across those sectoral programmes? Lynne Featherstone: The senior girls and women strategy group maintains a strategic overview of DFID's work across all the priority areas. It consolidates and shares best practice. We have senior divisional gender champions who are appointed in each division. They are responsible for each division. Q179 Pauline Latham: What does that mean? Lynne Featherstone: It means that is what they look at within their purview. Q180 Pauline Latham: In Britain or in-country? Lynne Featherstone: We regard ourselves as one organisation. Country ofcers are not that separate inasmuch as it is done as one piece. It is not just done here or done there. It is done across the piece. I don't know whether there are daily conferences but there is no separation in terms of what is going on in the country. Video conferences go on on a daily basis so ofces are not regarded as being over there or over here. This is a one-organisation approach. The policy division and the gender team oversee the implementation of the strategic vision across the pillars. They facilitate cohesion across the strategy. They chair the meetings and they produce the annual progress reports. Girls and women pillar leads are the technical experts in the four policy areas. Within their pillar area they work closely with regional and country colleagues to maintain a strategic overview of the work; establish communities of practice; share the evidence, innovation and best practice; provide technical and peer support for business case development; and develop new policy resources and evidence. I don't know whether my ofcials want to add some detail in terms of how they know enough about V AWG. Jen Marshall: One of the key roles of the social development adviser, when they are posted into an ofce, is to have those exact conversations with the sectoral teams. They are often quite stretched because they work across whole ranges of programmes, including growth, security and justice. They work closely, for example, with health and education advisers to discuss how in that context you should best tackle gender and violence , linking up to, as the Minister said, the main ideas and the people who lead that thinking at a global level. So it is an active conversation. For example, in our girls' education work in Nigeria, it is the education adviser and the social development adviser who sit down and look at how to make schools safe places to be, in the context of Nigeria, and design programmes that will deliver those results. Lynne Featherstone: May I go back to your previous question, because I did not answer you on education. The girls education challenge fund is one of the very innovative new programmes. I went with the Deputy Prime Minister to Ethiopia to launch a new girls education challenge fund programme there, which wasa massive investment. And it was exactly that. It was about very marginalised girls\u2014the poorest of girls\u2014 who could not get to school because the dangers en route were too severe. It was about some very practical things like going to collect children from various parts\u2014I suppose it is the equivalent of children going to school in a crocodile here\u2014to enable them to get to school and get back safely. Local providers and implementers are developing the actual practicalities of how you do it, how you get to the most marginalised girls, how you bring them to school, and how you protect them. Those are some of the things about keeping girls safe that really inhibit them having any chance. The girls in that example are the most marginalised and the most vulnerable. Q181 Pauline Latham: On 4 March, the Secretary of State pledged that DFID would launch an international call to action on violence against women and girls in humanitarian settings. Do you have any more details on that, please? Lynne Featherstone: The details are being worked out right now. I don't have more detail to give you. However, as I was saying at the beginning, I think there has been a gap in terms of the attention on violence against women and sexual violence in humanitarian circumstances. On the point you raised earlier about the UN not having a mandate\u2014that kind of crossover\u2014I hope that this event will be an opportunity for all the agencies and all the actors involved to bring forward the issues that need to be addressed, in particular, not in general. I do not have details about the conference; I understand it is to be in the autumn. I don't know whether Jo or Jen have more up-to-date information on that. Q182 Pauline Latham: We have heard that UN relief agencies still miss very basic benchmarks for safeguarding women in displacement and refugee camp settings. Do you think that DFID is sufciently clear that its funding of these agencies is contingent on international guidelines on tackling violence against women and girls, and do you think those guidelines are being met? Lynne Featherstone: I think we recognise, as I said, that there is a gap. In a sense, this is about everyone being aware that we are upping the ante on this. We think that this is important. It is about focusing all the agencies and all the actors on something that has not been delivered in the way it was meant to be. Q183 Pauline Latham: So what has changed? Lynne Featherstone: The change is not here yet. Part of the point of the call to action is to begin that change. How do you change those things, other than by withdrawing your money from the multilateral? We have had conversations about that, but you need the focus to be on the gap so it becomes a priority for those agencies, and it is no longer secondary to the food, shelter\u2014 Q184 Pauline Latham: So is this going to happen in two years, like all the other things? Lynne Featherstone: No; this is happening in the autumn.International Committee: Evidence Ev 55 9 May 2013 Lynne MP , Jo Moir and Jen Marshall Q185 Chair: Is this incorporated into the multilateral review? Pauline Latham: Or is the international call to action to do with the conference? Lynne Featherstone: That is a special thing to focus attention on the very issue you are raising. In terms of the multilateral aid review, violence against women was not in the 2010 MAR. It will be in the next one. Jo Moir: In terms of looking at violence in humanitarian settings, at the political level, yes, the call to action is really trying to galvanise agency leads across the humanitarian system\u2014leaders from the recipient developing countries\u2014to make sure that this is prioritised as part of rst humanitarian response. Very practically, we have committed to assessing all our humanitarian programmes\u2014new programmes and existing ones\u2014for violence against women and girls risks and to taking action where appropriate. That is happening over the next nancial year, so by March 2014 we will have assessed all our programmes. Also very practically, we are rolling out new training and guidance to our humanitarian advisers, so that they are much better equipped to design the programmes and to hold our partners to account when we are making investments. Q186 Fiona O'Donnell: I wonder whether I could ask you, Minister, about the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative. Do you not think that you should have been leading on this, rather than William Hague? Lynne Featherstone: I wish I was. Q187 Fiona O'Donnell: That's good to know. So what is the role of DIFD in taking it forward? Lynne Featherstone: This is brilliant. This is a bit about male leadership. It is great that William Hague has taken this on and has seen it as a priority. He really is pushing\u2014you had the G8 declaration and onward. In terms of what DFID is doing, I will let the ofcials say that, but basically there are a couple of things coming out of the G8 conference that we are mandated to do. I will let Jo give you a description of those two areas. More generally on PSVI, I am the violence against women champion, and PSVI has a narrow focus\u2014 rape as a weapon of war\u2014and it is extended to children now, but it is the most phenomenal flagship in terms of the message around impunity. Male impunity in all its situations has been one of the bottom lines of why nothing changes, because there are no consequences to actions. Although this is flagshipping on something that can rivet the world's attention because it is so high prole, it is a message right across the violence against women agenda, and I have been a really enthusiastic supporter. Q188 Fiona O'Donnell: There has been criticism that it is a bit of a risk just talking about sexual violence in conflict zones\u2014 Lynne Featherstone: But the marvellous thing is that it is unable to limit itself to that\u2014with any conversation you have around PSVI. In terms of what it is trying to do, it is focused on getting the evidence\u2014I think there were 13 commitments\u2014andgetting some prosecutions in the ultimate of extreme situations. In general\u2014I took it to CSW myself in terms of the G8, a world platform\u2014it is upping the ante beyond measure in terms of sexual violence and violence against women, and it is unable to conne itself to strict denitions in terms of what PSVI itself will do. At the dinner I went to last night, as I say, with the Special Representative Zainab Bangura, it is all about the whole issue of violence against women, and particularly about the attitudinal stuff and how you change social norms. So although it is focused relatively narrowly, it is beneting the whole eld. Q189 Fiona O'Donnell: You mentioned that it has been extended to include children. What evidence do you have that the expertise is there to support children through that process and afterwards, where children are victims or witnesses? Lynne Featherstone: Well, I think that is one of the things that are being worked on at the moment. I will let Jo answer. I was with Save the Children last night, and it has just produced a report giving the children's witness to their need. In terms of the expertise that is available, it is kind of in the FCO but I will hand over to Jo for any more detail on that. Jo Moir: In terms of the communiqu\u00e9 and how that speaks to DFID's work, there are two key things coming out. One thing is a commitment to ensuring that where we are working in conflict countries we are supporting national security and justice programmes to be able to look at issues of sexual violence and violence against women, and the second is around ensuring that violence against women and girls is included as part of rst response in humanitarian programming. In terms of children, in humanitarian programming, the protection of children is the responsibility of the agencies involved in the protection cluster. A cluster is one of the humanitarian system's ways of co- ordinating agencies around a particular sectoral issue. We would expect that where there is programming on violence that would include looking at issues of how you protect children. Q190 Pauline Latham: Minister, you are the lead Minister on FGM, and the plan is to end FGM in a generation. In this country, we have 20,000 people at risk of FGM. Some of the cutting happens in this country. Why is that? Why have we had no prosecutions and what are you doing about it? Lynne Featherstone: The Home Ofce leads on FGM in this country. I was in the Home Ofce before I went to DFID. The Home Ofce is doing a whole range of things. They published guidelines for front- line workers, because part of the problem is recognising it. Those guidelines are for social workers, teachers and health workers. Keir Starmer has just published Keir Starmer? Lynne Featherstone: The Director of Public Prosecutions. You are right that there have been no prosecutions. We would love there to be prosecutions but it has been very difcult. Cases have been broughtEv 56 International Development Committee: Evidence 9 May 2013 Lynne Featherstone MP , Jo Moir and Jen Marshall but have not got to court. I think six or eight possible prosecutions are being looked at or re-examined at the moment. You would have to go to the Home Ofce for the detail on that. I think there have been some cultural eggshells in this country that people have been tiptoeing over. This has come from me at DFID. However, part of the \u00a335 million is about the diaspora here, because they are intrinsically linked. We know that girls get taken every summer back to their mother countries\u2014 let alone the ones who are cut here. I think you will have seen, partly because of the media and human interest, that the ball is now rolling. I am about to conduct meetings. As champion in the area of violence against women, I straddle DFID, and as V AWG champion on this one, part of my responsibility is policy coherence across Whitehall. I will be undertaking meetings with Health, Education and the Home Ofce, to see how we can use the galvanising effect that is already beginning to be seen in this country to help us deal with our diaspora FGM issue. Q192 Fiona O'Donnell: I am sure, Minister, that we would all welcome the fact that for two weeks the TV programme \"Casualty\" decided to cover it as a story. I was disappointed that there was no reference to the police or justice issues. It seemed to think it was something you quietly intervened in and stopped. At least it was mainstream. Lynne Featherstone: It is a start and it gets to a lot of people that we can't reach as politicians. Q193 Fiona O'Donnell: Absolutely. You have spoken about the \u00a335 million programme to tackle FGM and said that what works in one area might not in another. You have focused on a social norms approach used in Senegal. Given that there is no evidence base supporting different approaches, why have you gone with the social norms model? Lynne Featherstone: No, we haven't gone with anything yet. I just said that is what I saw. To me, it made extremely good sense, when you are talking about fundamental change. It is interesting. FGM is violence against women; it is child abuse. How do you get people to change? Do you go in and say, \"You are the most dreadful people on earth. You have been doing this for 2,000 years. It is really wrong. You have got to stop\"? Will that be effective? Or do you work with the community in understanding and providing information so that change comes from within? Q194 Fiona O'Donnell: So you are not adopting a social norms approach? Lynne Featherstone: No; there is not adoption. I am simply saying that I was impressed by that approach because it made sense, but it is a very long-term approach. That is what the research part of the \u00a335 million fund is to do; it is to create a global evidence base of what works and what does not work. I am not xed about it. I might think something is really good, but if the evidence shows that it is the worst possible way to approach the matter, then I would accept the evidence base.Q195 Fiona O'Donnell: It is interesting that the Department has focused on the one intervention that is political and institutional. Every example you have given us today of where you have seen change has been at a community level. In terms of FGM, you spoke about a community where they were standing up and saying, \"No more in our community.\" One of the consequences is that that can then lead to early marriage because parents become concerned that if their daughter has not been cut she is more likely to lose her virginity outside of marriage. How are you joining up the two streams of work? Lynne Featherstone: I think that that is part of being a community. The way it works, from what I have seen in Senegal\u2014I do not want to harp too much on one example\u2014is that they are interlinked communities. Communities marry in the next village and the next village. They are all in the same situation, so no one child is vulnerable. One of the big issues in terms of change, and one of the problems that we have here, is that you cannot do it one girl at a time. When whole communities do it, the risk is not so much there. Within that programme, they work on early marriage as well, so it is not just one thing. From what I saw, it is not 100% successful, but it is probably 70% or 80% successful, which is a long way on from where we have been before. Q196 Fiona Bruce: You talked about being a Ministerial Champion and obviously that involves a huge amount of cross-Whitehall co-ordination. You talked about the Health Department and the Home Ofce. Baroness Warsi, who gave evidence before you did today, talked about the MOD, the FCO and the Attorney-General's Ofce. Do you feel that you have sufcient access authority and resources to drive forward this cross-departmental strategy, and how are you doing it in addition to the meetings that you have referred to that you are going to hold? Lynne Featherstone: I suppose the ofcial mechanism is the inter-ministerial group on violence against women. A Minister from every Department comes to those inter-ministerial groups and those sorts of issues can be raised there and then; each Department has the responsibility to take it up and drive it through. When I was in the Home Ofce, we published the violence against women strategy. I think it had 88 actions and then there were 14 more. That includes the international action, so there is an action plan that guides some of these issues. It is part of that whole overarching plan on violence against women, and I lobby very hard. Q197 Fiona Bruce: Do you think you need more resources? Lynne Featherstone: No, actually since I have been placed at DFID, it has been really good. What I will be looking to do\u2014we are working on it now\u2014is how I can pursue certain things. You know I talked about the messages that we had crafted. One of the challenges there is getting a grip of the Ministers' timetables and travel arrangements in time. There are core scripts. It is an organisational thing. We have to work through country desks and we could do with a bit more oomph.International Development Committee: Evidence Ev 57 9 May 2013 Lynne More authority? Lynne Featherstone: Well, I would just like it to be more successful. It is beginning to be. You know when you start something new, it takes a while to get it going. We have the messages and the system; we now need a checking process, because unless you read every read-out from every meeting, how do you know what was actually raised? Part of it is about the fact that senior Ministers raise these issues at the highest level, Government to Government, so that could do with a bit more oomph. Q199 Fiona Bruce: So are your ofcials going to try to put that in place? Lynne Featherstone: Yes, I think one of my ofcials is working on that particular programme. Q200 Fiona Bruce: Do you think that you should sit on the National Security Council in addition to the DFID Secretary of State, given that your mandate includes violence against women and girls in crisis and conflict settings? Lynne Featherstone: I am sure the Secretary of State is able to take that role on the National Security Council, but I would love to sit on it. Q201 Jeremy Lefroy: Good morning, Minister. Sir John Holmes, representing the International Rescue Committee, told us: \"If there was one single thing that DFID should do...it is to insist, when they are dealing with UN agencies, NGOs and so on in their funding decisions, that they will not fund unless\" violence against women and girls \"is a priority in their programmes\". I would appreciate your comments on that. Lynne Featherstone: I think he is a very clever man. He should be listened to. Q202 Jeremy Lefroy: So is that something that you think DFID will do, given that you make the decisions? Lynne Featherstone: That is the direction of travel. I appreciate I have been there ve months now, but I have not\u2014it is about getting all of these things in motion and moving. I am not sure that it would be conditional in the way that that was said, but in terms of its priority across all the agencies, it is rising and has to go further. Q203 Jeremy Lefroy: Coming back to something that Pauline Latham talked about earlier, we as a Committee have long felt that the UN does not take this matter seriously enough. Three of us met a senior ofcial from UN Women recently and she expressed the same view. I had a case from my own constituency. It seems the UN does not treat women working within its own organisation with sufcient respect sometimes, which greatly concerns me, and I have raised that to a higher level. Can you comment specically on that? In the case of the DRC, we were told by the representative of UN Women that the renewed mandate was a stronger one that would give UN peacekeeping forces more ability to tackle the perpetrators of violence against women. Do you feelthat that has made a change already? There are two issues. Lynne Featherstone: I wouldn't be able to verify that change. I have no personal experience. I am not aware that it has effected change yet, but if that is the case, I would hope that it does make a difference. These things are very important. It is one of the things I was talking about on leadership. It signals and delivers a great change. I turn to Jo Moir on the UN. On the particular issue about how the UN treats its own women, it is not something that has come across my desk, to be honest. I met the UN representative in South Sudan, who was a woman. She was very clued- up and able and certainly gave no impression to me that there was anything like that. However, I will look into it now that you have raised it. I don't know if Jo wants to add to it. It is not something I am familiar with. Jo Moir: In terms of the position of women within the UN, in my experience it depends very much on the culture of the individual agency or the part of the secretariat and what the leadership is like, and it varies from year to year and from agency to agency. Q204 Jeremy Lefroy: But should that be the case? Should it depend on the culture of an agency? Jo Moir: No, it shouldn't. Q205 Jeremy Lefroy: Is that something that we are taking up as part of our MAR? Lynne Featherstone: I have just said I will look at it. It has not come across my horizon. I am quite alarmed to hear you say that. I will look at it. Jo Moir: In terms of the priority that the UN attaches to looking at violence against women and girls and its programming, it is fair to say that the humanitarian agencies have strong policies. They are not always implemented. It is not always treated as a priority as a part of rst response. As I said before, that is something we want to look at. We are looking across all our programmes to make sure that it is part of it. In terms of the development agencies, as the Minister said, violence was not something that was looked at in the 2010 MAR. It is a factor that we want to look at in the 2015 MAR, when we come to that. In the meantime, I think that we have got to do a bit of homework, and go out and have meetings with UN partners. UN Women is now a couple of years into its establishment. It has had some success on the ground\u2014particularly in terms of advocacy, it is well placed in the UN system to do that\u2014but it has also faced difculties in terms of demonstrating results, so that is where we would like to work with it further to make sure that it can have traction with its UN partners. Q206 Jeremy Lefroy: I would also like to follow up something that Pauline Latham referred to earlier. I very much welcome the emphasis on practical programmes that either stand alone or are in conjunction with other programmes, but it seems to me from personal experience that some things can be solved without huge amounts of money\u2014compared with the amounts of money available\u2014and just withEv 58 International Development Committee: Evidence 9 May 2013 Lynne Featherstone MP , Jo Moir and Jen Marshall will. I am particularly thinking of water and the drilling of wells. Although that is not easy in many countries; it is certainly not incredibly difcult. I have seen programmes where, with a relatively small amount of money, large numbers of wells have been drilled and huge differences have been made to communities, particularly to women and girls and particularly to girls' education. I think that we sometimes miss the blindingly obvious. In its water and sanitation programme\u2014perhaps under your leadership, Minister\u2014DFID might say, \"Look, for a cost of $5,000 or $10,000 a well,\" which is often what the cost is, even in fairly remote communities, \"we can make a huge difference to large numbers of people by just concentrating on something like that, together with the provision of sanitation facilities.\" I just wonder whether we sometimes make things a little too complicated, and whether we should actually say, \"This is what we can do. If you, as a country, are determined to make sure that every single community has access, within a short distance, to basic water and sanitation, we will support you in that,\" rather than trying to put it into some more complex programme. Lynne Featherstone: Well, I would agree with you that water really is one of the simpler things\u2014if that is what you are saying\u2014that you can do quite easily. We have doubled our target for our WASH programmes to \u00a360 million, and we are scaling up to deliver right now, so I think that in a way we are already doing what you are asking. Q207 Jeremy Lefroy: Well, no. That is very good to hear, but I am just thinking that, given that violence against women and girls and women's rights are so important to the UK and this Government, you can actually say, \"Look, even this is not enough. We need to do more on this, because it is such a fundamental part of the issue.\" Lynne Featherstone: Well, yes, but these things are not quite as easy as described. You have to have the capacity, and it is no use putting in a water facility if it cannot be maintained. It has to be sustainable, which means a whole range of other things. We have to make sure that where we do invest money, it is for the long term in terms of WASH. The other thing is that, while it is very effective in terms of women obviously not having to go out, the level of need around violence against women is so huge across so many places\u2014there are barely any refuges; there is barely any justice\u2014that we need to look at it more globally. Although I understand that you are saying that that is a quick win, it would solve one of the issues, but it would not solve some of the more fundamental issues\u2014around the social norm stuff, for a start. Q208 Fiona O'Donnell: There is no doubting your passion and commitment on the issue of violence against women and girls, and that of the Secretary of State and of the Foreign Secretary, but in order for that to live beyond the lives and careers of existing Ministers and to ensure that it is embedded in the FCO, the MOD and DFID, do you agree that all three Departments need to recruit and train more staff on these issues, so that it is truly embedded?Lynne Featherstone: There are a lot of competing priorities. If it was just up to me to say, then yes, of course, but it is perhaps even more important to get the world to focus on it. As Ministers, we do not have an opinion on the MDGs because of the Prime Minister being on the High-Level Panel, but there will come after the report of the panel is published the opportunity for contributions in terms of consultation in the broader sense. I am hopeful that this type of issue will gain high visibility in whatever the resulting framework or goals are. A world focus at something like that level might make the step change greater than any one country, any one person or any one organisation could deliver. Q209 Chair: I suppose, Minister, that we obviously should not overplay our hand, but the fact that the UK will deliver 0.7% makes us the second largest aid donor globally and gives us quite a high degree of authority. Lynne Featherstone: It does. Q210 Chair: There are two things. One is in relation to the United Nations. We all know it is a somewhat dysfunctional, or varifunctional, organisation. Some things it does well and some things it does badly, and the politics makes it very untidy to say the least, but presumably, as a major contributor we can perhaps have some influence over improving it. Sir John Holmes takes a very radical step. Nevertheless, would you agree that the UK has a right to expect some degree of response when we are engaging with the UN, when we say, \"We are major players, major contributors and major partners of the UN and there are some things that really just have to improve or we cannot go on funding the bits that don't work\"? Lynne Featherstone: I think we are looking at how we can ensure that our admirable and substantive contribution in terms of development in the world can have more influence and more payback for the money that we give to various organisations\u2014not just the UN\u2014in making sure that our voice is listened to. Q211 Chair: The Secretary of State says in terms of the post-2015 framework that she wants a stand-alone goal on gender equality. The Prime Minister has talked about an overarching abolition of absolute poverty by 2030, but would you have something that is about gender equality or the rights of women, not subservient to it but alongside it? Those are the two key issues. Lynne Featherstone: Like climate change, I think that women needs to be embedded across all the goals. If I am talking in my personal capacity, as I understand the Secretary of State was when she spoke about having a stand-alone goal and a mainstreamed goal on gender equality\u2014and I agree with her\u2014I would perhaps go more to the violence against women part of that, because it is an issue for both the developed and the developing world. It is a very important part, perhaps, of the millennium development goals that it is not just developed countries\u2014the voice of the poor and all that. Even more than that, the thing that has shocked me most, as I have held this role, is that this is an epidemic andInternational Development Committee: Evidence Ev 59 9 May 2013 Lynne Featherstone MP , Jo Moir and Jen Marshall a massive issue in every single country in this world. There is not one place where violence against women is not a serious issue, including the United Kingdom, so I would welcome a focus on that. In fact, having discussed this with others, I think that sometimes it is almost too difcult for countries. It is quite simple, in a way, to deliver water and sanitation, and who is going to argue against educating girls in school, but getting rid of something that is based on a social norm, such as violence against women and sexual violence, is something that many countries, right across the developed and developing world, wrestle with, and they perhaps feel that if it were to be so prominent it would be very difcult to achieve. My view is that if you don't make it that important, people will not strive to achieve it. Q212 Chair: May I just clarify the point? You implied that the Secretary of State was speaking in a personal capacity. Lynne Featherstone: My understanding\u2014 Q213 Chair: My point is: is there a DFID agenda to try to promote this post-2015? Lynne Featherstone: There is not a Government position at the moment, at all. Q214 Chair: Is DFID arguing for a Government position? Lynne Featherstone: Oh, always. You argue from where you stand. Q215 Chair: Is there any resistance to it, or is it just that there isn't a position?Lynne Featherstone: There just isn't a position. Until the High-Level Panel reports and the consultation, there is no Government position. Q216 Chair: So the process is that because the Prime Minister is co-chair, the panel gets its work done and whatever happens is in the second part after that. At some point or another there will be a\u2014 Lynne Featherstone: I am not saying that we haven't put our two penn'orth in wherever the opportunity has arisen\u2014you have given me the opportunity today to so do\u2014and I am sure that the Secretary of State is doing the same, but there isn't an ofcial position. Q217 Chair: We will also publish a report, which will be timely, so it is something for the Committee to consider in that context. Lynne Featherstone: Excellent. Chair: Thank you very much, Minister, for appearing in front of us again. I hope you will see from the questions that this is an issue that the Committee also recognises as absolutely central to development, and the fact that we have a champion in you and the fact that the Government are raising the issue up the agenda is something that the Committee welcomes. The Committee's Report hopes to be part of the process of promoting it. Lynne Featherstone: I would like to thank the Committee for its interest. All of this is helpful in pushing forward this agenda with a focus that we have not seen before. It is an opportunity to drive this one through.Ev 60 International Development Committee: Evidence Written evidence Written evidence submitted by ActionAid Summary ActionAid1warmly welcomes this inquiry. It offers a timely complement to the increasing commitment that the UK Government and the Secretary of State for International Development have been demonstrating on this agenda. In this submission we outline four areas for action that offer practical ways to advance these efforts. These are: \u2014 Applying DFID's Theory of Change for Tackling Violence Against Women and Girls to all of the UK Government's work on this agenda. \u2014 Coordinating work on violence against women and girls across teams and departments within DFID. \u2014 Increasing cross-Whitehall coordination on violence against women and girls. \u2014 Strengthening DFID's humanitarian responses on violence against women and girls. To help tackle violence against women and girls (V AWG) and advance women's rights, we propose the UK Government: 1. Work to ensure the post-2015 framework includes a specic target on ending V AWG within a dedicated standalone goal on gender equality and women's empowerment. 2. Seek to galvanise the global community to pursue the eradication of V AWG as an urgent and achievable goal through a clear compact with associated resources, similar to the way the global community has mobilised to respond to HIV and AIDS through UNAIDS. 3. Pursue a coherent and coordinated cross-government approach to addressing V AWG internationally by revising the international section of the cross-government strategy on V AWG and adding a framework for monitoring impacts, to align it with DFID's new Theory of Change for Tackling Violence Against Women and Girls. 4. Ensure that country-specic results frameworks include KPIs and indicators so that DFID's progress on tackling V AWG can be assessed. 5. Recognise the catalytic role women's rights organisations (WROs) play in tackling V AWG and embed a commitment to actively support WROs across policy, programming and funding on V AWG, including by: providing additional, dedicated funding to WROs working on V AWG, and increasing devolved funding for work on V AWG through women's funds that have strong partnerships with southern WROs. 6. Track all aid using the DAC gender equality marker. 7. Revive the DFID Gender Equality Action Plan as a useful tool for ensuring cross-team coordination on women's rights issues and strengthen its emphasis and actions on V AWG. 8. Include in the Gender Equality Action Plan clear steps to build capacity on V AWG across DFID teams in recognition of its impact across DFID priorities and workplans. 9. Ensure V AWG is prioritised at senior levels and that staff, including at senior levels and across all of DFID, have the resources, capacities and skills they need to deliver on V AWG programming. 10. Ensure the Ministerial Champion on Violence Against Women and Girls Overseas has the access, authority and resources to drive this strategy forward across Government, especially across the FCO, DFID and MoD, and reports annually to parliament on progress. 11. Ensure the ToC for V AWG is integrated into all of the UK Government's relevant development, conflict, peacebuilding and humanitarian strategies and workstreams, including the National Action Plan on UNSCR 1325 on Women, Peace and Security, the Building Stability Overseas Strategy (BSOS), and the Joint Analysis of Conflict and Stability (JACS). 12. Ensure a member of the National Security Council has explicit responsibility for women, peace and security to ensure gender perspectives are taken into account in all discussions. 13. Set out a clear plan of action to ensure DFID, the FCO and the MoD are coordinating their efforts to increase the impact and sustainability of the PSVI. 14. Routinely ask multilaterals and other recipients of UK aid to report back on how they are responding to and tackling V AWG as part of their monitoring frameworks. 1ActionAid is an international NGO working with poor and excluded people to eradicate poverty and injustice in 45 countries. Our vision is a world without poverty and injustice in which every person enjoys the right to a life with dignity. Our positions reflect the experiences of our staff and partners in Africa, Asia, the Americas and Europe.International Development Committee: Evidence Ev 61 15. Review and seek to influence the policies of all humanitarian funds it contributes to, including ECHO (the European Community Humanitarian Ofce), to ensure they comply with international humanitarian law on the provision of non-discriminatory medical aid, including abortions, regardless of local laws. 16. Seek to influence the US Government to lift the abortion ban attached to US humanitarian aid for girls and women raped in armed conflict. 17. Take steps to ensure that UK aid recipients such as the ICRC take measures to ensure that US abortion restrictions do not impact support provided by the UK. 18. Continue to ensure that V AWG is a criteria for disbursing funds from the RRF, and also ensure this criteria similarly applies to all other areas of humanitarian response. 19. Ensure at least 15% of all UK conflict peace-building funds, in line with UN targets, are spent on addressing women's specic needs and advancing gender equality or empowering women, including by directly nancing women's rights organisations. 20. Seek to influence the wider humanitarian sector to establish more robust policies and procedures to prevent, identify and ensure swift action when cases of abuse by humanitarian workers are reported, including working to make it easier and safer for women and girls to report abuse. ActionAid UK has also supported the development of the Gender and Development Network's (GADN) response to this consultation and would refer the Committee to that document for a wider-ranging discussion of V AWG, its impact and recommendations for the UK Government's response. A. Introduction A.1ActionAid's experience in over 40 countries has taught us that V AWG is both a violation of basic rights and a fundamental barrier to eradicating poverty and building peace. Allowing it to continue unabated not only sends the message that we do not value women or their lives, it also means that progress towards development goals is destined to fail. A.2Government responses are universally inadequate on a number of levels\u2014they fail to protect women from violence in the rst place, withhold vital support and rehabilitation services from survivors of violence, and fail to ensure women and girls have access to justice. A.3As a key international voice on development, the UK government is in a unique position to lead a new global approach to tackling V AWG, particularly through Prime Minister David Cameron's appointment as chair of the MDG renewal process. The rst step is to recognise that V AWG is both a development and a human rights issue\u2014advancing women's rights is a valuable end in itself; the second is to consolidate the idea that good governance requires the eradication of V AWG so that it no longer acts as a barrier to women and girls' achieving other basic rights and entitlements, including participation in decision making at all levels of society. The UK should: \u2014 Work to ensure the post-2015 framework includes a specic target on ending VAWG within a dedicated standalone goal on gender equality and women' s empowerment. \u2014 Seek to galvanise the global community to pursue the eradication of VAWG as an urgent and achievable goal through a clear compact with associated resources, similar to the way the global community has mobilised to respond to HIV and AIDS through UNAIDS. B. Applying DFID's Theory of Change for Tackling VAWG B.1DFID recently produced a new Theory of Change for Tackling V AWG (ToC).2This ToC outlines the four specic sets of interventions DFID should pursue to eliminate all forms of V AWG: 1. Empower women and girls 2. Change the social norms that condone and perpetuate V AWG 3. Build political will and legal and institutional capacity to prevent and respond to V AWG 4. Increase the provision of comprehensive services for women and girls that are victims and survivors of violence B.2The challenge now is for DFID to align its programming with the ToC and track impact over time, including monitoring and adjusting individual country programmes, and tracking spending on women's rights and V AWG, which has been a challenge. B.3DFID has traditionally focused on building institutional capacity and providing comprehensive services. There has been relatively little focus on changing social norms or on empowerment as essential strategies in tackling violence. 2Developed by ActionAid on behalf of the Gender and Development Network: http://www.dd.gov.uk/Documents/publications1/ how-to-note-vawg-1.pdfEv 62 International Development Committee: Evidence B.4DFID's new \u00a325m innovation fund offers a welcome opportunity to ll this gap. However, the reality is that social norm change and empowering women and girls require longer time horizons than DFID programmes tend to work in. They also require dedicated support to the women's rights organisations (WROs) that are leading innovation and delivery on the ground and are at the forefront of social change around the world\u2014but often on very limited and insecure budgets. DFID therefore needs to be clear about how specic programmes correspond to the ToC, and what changes can be achieved during their lifecycles. DFID also needs to prioritise investing in WROs in ways that mean they can absorb resources and continue to set the agenda. B.5DFID's ToC should also inform the UK Government's work on V AWG across all of its international work to ensure there is a consistent and coherent approach. Specically, the ToC should form the basis of a revision to the international section of the cross-government strategy on V AWG, incorporating the work of the FCO and the MoD, as well as the Home Ofce where relevant. This revised strategy should be complemented with a monitoring framework so progress can be assessed annually. The UK should: \u2014 Pursue a coherent and coordinated cross-government approach to addressing VAWG internationally by revising the international section of the cross-government strategy on VAWG and adding a framework for monitoring impacts, to align it with DFID' s ToC. \u2014 Ensure that country-specic results frameworks include KPIs and indicators so that DFID' s progress on tackling VAWG can be assessed. \u2014 Recognise the catalytic role WROs play in tackling VAWG and embed a commitment to actively support WROs across policy, programming and funding on VAWG, including by: providing additional, dedicated funding to WROs working on VAWG, and increasing devolved funding for work on VAWG through women' s funds that have strong partnerships with southern WROs. \u2014 Track all aid using the DAC gender equality marker. C. Coordinating work on VAWG within DFID C.1 Generally, where DFID sets out to intervene to reduce V AWG, its work is to be congratulated. The V AWG pillar leads, sitting within the Security and Justice Team within CHASE, have shown that they are a competent lead on this issue and should be acknowledged as such. C.2That said, work on V AWG within DFID is heavily siloed and the position of the pillar leads within a subsection of CHASE seems to affect the extent to which V AWG work is mainstreamed across other teams and departments. In the past, the DFID Gender Equality Action Plan proved to be a useful document for raising the prole of women's rights within DFID and ensuring cross-team oversight of key priorities and, when it was discontinued, was widely felt to be a great loss by civil society. C.3 There is a clear rationale for vital work on V AWG by other teams as the ToC and other evidence shows.3This evidence base adds up to an impressive argument in favour of increased capacity on and prioritisation of V AWG across all teams and divisions. This should include centralised monitoring and management to ensure consistency and maintain quality. C.4V AWG work can seem deceptively simple. Ill thought out or overly simplistic approaches can do more harm than good and have the potential to harm the women and girls DFID most wants to support and protect. Each team therefore needs the in-house capacity to both ensure that V AWG gains sufcient prominence in division agendas and that they have the skills to appropriately integrate V AWG in their work. The UK should: \u2014 Revive the DFID Gender Equality Action Plan as a useful tool for ensuring cross-team coordination on women' s rights issues and strengthen its emphasis and actions on VAWG. \u2014 Include in the Gender Equality Action Plan clear steps to build capacity on VAWG across DFID teams in recognition of its impact across DFID priorities and workplans. \u2014 Ensure VAWG is prioritised at senior levels and that staff, including at senior levels and across all of DFID, have the resources, capacities and skills they need to deliver on VAWG programming. D. Increasing cross-Whitehall coordination on VAWG D.1 There are a number of parallel government processes that influence the UK's work on V AWG, particularly in fragile and conflict-affected states including: 1. The Cross-Government Violence against Women and Girls Strategy (Home Ofce) 2. The DFID Gender Strategy 3. The National Action Plan on UNSCR 1325 Women, Peace and Security (FCO) 3See for example: Destined to fail? How violence against women is undoing development , ActionAid, February 2010: http://www.actionaid.org.uk/doc_lib/destined_to_fail.pdfInternational Development Committee: Evidence Ev 63 4. The Building Stability Overseas Strategy (FCO) D.2In addition, recent projects such as the FCO Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict Initiative (PSVI), while very welcome, have highlighted the importance of ensuring cross-Whitehall coordination to ensure that opportunities to empower women and bring about sustainable change are not lost.4 D.3Policy coherence between these different UK strategies will ensure greater impact and should therefore be strengthened. The Ministerial Champion on Violence Against Women and Girls Overseas, the rst post of its kind in the world, has a critical role to play in this effort, especially as its mandate covers the work of all the international departments\u2014DFID, the FCO and the MoD. D.4Successful approaches to preventing conflict and reducing poverty in fragile and conflict affected states benet from aligning diplomatic, defence and development policies to promote women's rights and reduce V AWG. Further, a priority focus on women's rights across the UK's international agenda would help to ensure delivery on development is not put in competition with or undermined by other important global agendas. The UK should: \u2014 Ensure the Ministerial Champion on Violence Against Women and Girls Overseas has the access, authority and resources to drive the international section of the cross-government VAWG strategy forward across Government, especially across the FCO, DFID and MoD, and reports annually to parliament on progress. \u2014 Ensure the ToC is integrated into all of the UK Government' s relevant development, conflict, peacebuilding and humanitarian strategies and workstreams, including the National Action Plan on UNSCR 1325 on Women, Peace and Security, the Building Stability Overseas Strategy (BSOS), and the Joint Analysis of Conflict and Stability (JACS). \u2014 Ensure a member of the National Security Council has explicit responsibility for women, peace and security to ensure gender perspectives are taken into account in all discussions. \u2014 Set out a clear plan of action to ensure DFID, the FCO and the MoD are coordinating their efforts to increase the impact and sustainability of the PSVI. E. Strengthening DFID's humanitarian responses on VAWG E.1 There is now a wealth of evidence conrming that V AWG is a predictable and common threat in emergency situations, and also that tackling such violence saves women and girls' lives.5 E.2 It is clear that DFID would like to ensure its approach to tackling V AWG applies to its work in humanitarian situations. For example, the Secretary of State recently highlighted its importance in a key note speech.6Tackling V AWG also features as a commitment in DFID's strategic humanitarian policy.7 E.3DFID must now ensure this commitment is translated into practice. In particular, DFID needs to develop systems that mandate that V AWG is addressed at the onset of emergencies, as part of a package of life-saving and community-based protection activities.8This includes supporting the delivery of specialised services, such as safe spaces for victims and survivors to report and recover from violence as well as psycho-social and medical aid, as well as mitigating against violence across the delivery of mainstream services, such as making sure there are inside locks on latrines provided as part of emergency WASH services. The inclusion of V AWG in the decision making checklist of the Rapid Response Facility (RRF) is a positive step in this direction. E.4In addition, DFID must do much more to ensure the humanitarian funding it provides via multilaterals and other partners responds to V AWG. This includes pushing multilaterals which DFID provides core funding to, such as UNHCR, to better account for what they are doing to respond to V AWG in humanitarian situations. It also means asking partners who receive emergency funding from DFID to report back on how they have tackled V AWG as part of their overall response. Where DFID's contributions are pooled with others, it is especially important to ensure that its priorities are addressed and not undermined. The recent UK Government decision to work harder to ensure women and girls who have survived violence receive adequate and non- discriminatory medical aid, such as access to abortions, in line with international humanitarian laws, is welcome. E.5Finally, DFID should seek to eliminate all abuse of women and girls during humanitarian emergencies by aid workers, as well as increase women and girls' access to justice after any violence.

The UK should: \u2014 Routinely ask multilaterals and other recipients of UK aid to report back on how they are responding to and tackling VAWG as part of monitoring frameworks. \u2014 Review and seek to influence the policies of all humanitarian funds it contributes to, including ECHO (the European Community Humanitarian Ofce), to ensure they comply with international humanitarian law on the provision of non-discriminatory medical aid, including abortions, regardless of local laws. \u2014 Seek to influence the US Government to lift the abortion ban attached to US humanitarian aid for girls and women raped in armed conflict. \u2014 Take steps to ensure that UK aid recipients such as the ICRC take measures to ensure that US abortion restrictions do not impact support provided by the UK.9 \u2014 Continue to ensure that VAWG is a criteria for disbursing funds from the RRF , and also ensure this criteria similarly applies to all other areas of humanitarian response. \u2014 Ensure at least 15% of all UK conflict peace-building funds, in line with UN targets, are spent on addressing women' s specic needs and advancing gender equality or empowering women, including by directly nancing WROs.10 \u2014 Seek to influence the wider humanitarian sector to establish more robust policies and procedures to prevent, identify and ensure swift action when cases of abuse by humanitarian workers are reported, including working to make it easier and safer for women and girls to report abuse. February 2013 Written evidence submitted by Equality Now Summary This submission includes analysis and recommendations on 6 of the 8 areas of the inquiry: \u2014 The extent to which DFID programmes on V AWG support the right policy instruments and reflect best practice, as outlined in DFID's Theory of Change and related guidance \u2014 Co-ordination and integration of DFID's work on V AWG with the other priority areas outlined in DFID's Gender Vision, and with other areas of DFID programming (eg governance and conflict, health and education, economic growth, humanitarian disasters and emergencies) \u2014 Strength of UK leadership role internationally on V AWG, including the effectiveness of DFID's work with multilateral partners and the UK's International Champion for V AWG position \u2014 Cross-governmental working within the UK, particularly co-operation between DFID, the FCO and the MOD on the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative and the UK Government National Action Plan on UNSCR 1325 Women, Peace and Security \u2014 Key events in 2013: the 57th Session of the UN Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) in March, and the G8 Summit in June \u2014 V AWG within the post-2015 development goals Equality now particularly emphasises the following points: \u2014 A strong legal framework is a vital component in tackling discrimination against women and girls, including V AWG. DFID's policies can only go so far if there is state sanctioned impunity. Laws against FGM, domestic violence, sexual violence and abuse, child marriage and incest as well as all other forms of V AWG set societal norms on what is acceptable and should be fully implemented to punish perpetrators if they breach these. Equally, laws which discriminate against women must be eliminated, eg laws which exempt rapists from criminal prosecution if they marry their victims. State sanctioned impunity gives ofcial support to the discrimination and violence such laws promote. \u2014 There is a renewed sense of momentum particularly by African countries to address FGM, as evidenced by the recent UNGA resolution on FGM. Equality Now welcomes the current enhanced focus by DFID on the issue of FGM and its intention to start a specic initiative, building on its work and efforts thus far. FGM is still highly prevalent, and the trend towards medicalisation needs to be addressed. Preventing FGM contributes to ve out of eight of the Millennium Development Goals: universal education, gender equality, child health, maternal health and HIV/AIDs. 9For more background on this issue and detailed recommendations, please see the submission by the Global Justice Center. 10From the ground up: women' s roles in local peacebuilding in Afghanistan, Liberia, Nepal, Pakistan and Sierra Leone Worldwide, 2012: http://www.actionaid.org/sites/les/actionaid/from_the_ground_up_-_full_report.pdfInternational Development Committee: Evidence Ev 65 About Equality Now Equality Now is an international women's rights organisation dedicated to ending violence and discrimination against women and girls around the world. Issues of concern include female genital mutilation (FGM)11, sexual violence, sex trafcking and discrimination in law. We have organisational and individual members in 160 countries. We support at the international level grassroots organisations to address women's rights violations by mobilising public pressure. Background Violence against women and girls (V AWG) is a global and widespread problem encompassing a multitude of issues such as domestic violence, child marriage, forced marriage, 'honour' killings, FGM and rape, among others. As Lakshmi Puri, UN Assistant Secretary-General and UN Women Deputy Executive Director recently stated, \"violence against women must be recognised as a threat to democracy, peace and security; an obstacle to sustainable development; and an appalling human rights violation\".12 We have been asked in this submission particularly to highlight the issue of FGM. The WHO estimates that globally, 100-140 million girls and women have been subjected to some form of FGM.13FGM is practised in at least 28 countries in Africa, as well as in parts of Asia and the Middle East. According to the latest estimates from the WHO, it is estimated that now, for women 10 years and above, more than 101 million in 27 African countries and the Yemen have undergone FGM14which is an increase from 2008 estimates.15An estimated 3.3 million girls are at risk each year, if the prevalence continues at the same rate as it is today for those 15-19 years old.16This increase in prevalence and the numbers of girls at risk of FGM add to the urgency of dealing with the issue. FGM is practised across all educational levels and social classes and occurs among various religious groups (Muslims, Christians and animists), although none of the monotheistic religions mandate it. Prevalence rates vary signicantly from country to country, ranging from nearly 98 % in Somalia, 93% in Djibouti, 91% in Egypt, 96% in Guinea and 94% in Sierra Leone, to less than 1% in Uganda).17Prevalence rates also vary within countries. In the last decade, FGM has gained increased recognition as a health and human rights issue among African governments18, the international community, women's organisations, and professional associations. Some of the data that have been collected in recent years show lower levels of cutting among girls ages 15-19. However, this is offset in term of numbers affected by increasing population growth, and FGM remains widespread in the African region, and in fact appears to be on the increase, as shown above. FGM violates a range of human rights of girls and women, including the right to non-discrimination and to the protection from physical and psychological or emotional violence and abuse. The practice poses serious physical and mental health risks for women and young girls, especially for girls and women who have undergone the extreme forms of the procedure. According to a 2006 WHO study, FGM can be linked to increased complications in childbirth and even maternal deaths.19Other side effects include severe pain, haemorrhage, tetanus, infection, infertility, cysts and abscesses, urinary incontinence, and psychological and sexual problems. In this context, FGM violates the rights of girls and women to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, and, in the most extreme cases, to the right to life. FGM is nearly always carried out on minors and is a gross violation of the rights of the girl child. It is often a precursor of early/forced marriage and has far-reaching developmental implications. In many African cultures, girls are usually taken out of school for the mutilation and are then married off. With no formal education and early marriage, girls become economically dependent on their husbands, which, coupled with a lack of negotiation skills, can leave them more vulnerable to abuse. Difculties in negotiating sexual relations can also increase their vulnerability to HIV transmission. 11Equality Now's focus is the implementation of legal and policy measures to prevent girls from undergoing FGM. Equality Now works extensively on the issue both in the UK (we serve as the Secretariat of the UK's All Party Parliamentary Group on FGM) and globally. In Africa Equality Now is partner to 26 local organizations promoting actions against FGM in 19 countries. 12Lakshmi Puri, UN Assistant Secretary-General and Women Deputy Executive Director, see: http://www.unwomen.org/2013/ 01/one-african-voice-to-end-violence-against-women-and-girls-in-the-run-up-to-the-57th-session-of-the-commission-on-the- 14Yoder, Wang and Johansen, Estimating the Numbers of Girls and Women with FGM, Upcoming publication to be published in 2013.

For the 15 countries (Djibouti, Egypt, Ethiopia, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Kenya, Senegal, Sudan, Burkina Faso, Gambia, Uganda, Somalia, Eritrea, Mali, Mauritania) currently supported by UNFPA-UNICEF, only Ethiopia does not have a national policy but all have action plans (Communication with UNFPA, New York, January 2013) . 19WHO, Female Genital Mutilation and Obstetric Outcomes: WHO Collaborative Study in six African Countries. Department of Reproductive Health and Research, 2006.Ev 66 International Development Committee: Evidence An emerging issue of concern is the increasing medicalisation of FGM. According to the WHO, there has been a dramatic increase in the proportion of FGM operations carried out by trained health-care personnel20. A recent WHO analysis of existing data shows that more than 18% of all girls and women who have been subjected to FGM in the countries from which data are available have had the procedure performed on them by a health-care provider. There are large variations between countries, from less than 1% in several countries, to between 9% and 74% in six countries.21The Ministry of Health of Indonesia has produced guidelines to promote the so-called \"lesser forms\" of FGM. Whilst this approach claims to reduce some of the health consequences of the procedure, it serves instead to obscure the fact that FGM is a human rights violation. In addition, legitimising any form of FGM hinders the development of long-term solutions for ending the practice altogether, rather entrenching it through ofcial sanction. Please nd our detailed responses below. Key issues: The extent to which DFID programmes on VAWG support the right policy instruments and reflect best practice, as outlined in DFID' s Theory of Change and related guidance 1) Equality Now broadly agrees with the general principles outlined in DFID's Theory of Change. 2) We note, however, that while normative frameworks and legal sanctions are not by themselves enough to reduce V AWG,22and that where legal frameworks do exist, their implementation is often problematic23, robust laws on V AWG are necessary at a minimum to give women legal recourse if they are violated. DFID's policies can only go so far if there is state sanctioned impunity for violence through the absence of strong laws against V AWG. Laws against FGM, domestic violence, sexual violence and abuse, child marriage and incest as well as all other forms of V AWG set societal norms on what is acceptable and should be fully implemented to punish perpetrators if they breach these. Equally, laws which discriminate against women must be eliminated, eg laws which exempt rapists from criminal prosecution if they marry their victims. In countries where there are anti-FGM laws, governments, have on the whole failed to implement them. Mechanisms for monitoring the implementation of legislation are also essential. Laws against V AWG must carry appropriate punishments in order to serve as a deterrent and implement the law accordingly. Successful prosecutions have been shown to be effective in preventing FGM. Sasiano Nchoe was a 12 year old girl from the Maasai community in Narok, Kenya, who bled to death after being subjected to FGM in August 2008. Sasiano's father and the circumciser were arrested and later sentenced to ten years' imprisonment after pleading guilty to manslaughter in April 2010. Since the judgement, members from Sasiano's community fear arrest and prosecution if caught carrying out the practice. In Burkina Faso, where the law is applied alongside public education, there has been a dramatic reduction of FGM prevalence between women (74%) and their daughters (25%) with only 14.2% of women surveyed in that country want the practice to continue.24This illustrates what success is possible if a government addresses the issue seriously and comprehensively. 3) To ensure that women and girls have access to justice, funding is needed to support them through the legal process and provide legal aid where required. Specialised trainings on women's rights and on the application of laws banning harmful practices should be provided throughout the law enforcement system. 4) Regarding DFID's recognition of the need for social change, including through addressing attitudes, education and awareness-raising are necessary to effectively tackle all forms of V AWG. DFID should promote education in schools and communities which fosters respect for girls' and women's human rights and for men and women to acknowledge FGM as a human rights violation. This includes education on the existing international and national legal framework. Such knowledge will help women and girls feel supported in their own choices. 5) DFID should seek to support those programmes bringing together community education, child protection mechanisms and legal implementation. Community education alone is not enough to end FGM in practising communities25. The model should protect and prevent girls from being mutilated and ensure prosecution of perpetrators. This would involve all key stakeholders such as law enforcement ofcers, social workers, media, teachers, health professionals, religious and traditional leaders, parents and community members. 6) Women's rights organisations should be supported as critical agents for change. 20WHO (2010), Global strategy to stop health-care providers from performing female genital mutilation UNAIDS, 23Ibid, p. 7. 24Sipsma, H L et al,Bull World Health Organ 2012;90:120-127F,doi:10.2471/BLT.11.090886 25Protecting girls from undergoing female genital mutilation in Kenya and Tanzania: http://www.equalitynow.org/sites/default/ les/Protecting%20Girls_FGM_Kenya_Tanzania.pdfInternational Development Committee: Evidence Ev 67 7) DIFD's approach should take into account linkages between various forms of V AWG. For example, FGM is also a precursor to child marriage; this not only means that addressing one phenomenon also affects the other, but also that for interventions to be truly effective they must address both, as well as other connected V AWG issues, simultaneously. 8) We recommend DFID make girls' education a key priority. Co-ordination and integration of DFID' s work on VAWG with the other priority areas outlined in DFID' s Gender Vision, and with other areas of DFID programming (eg governance and conflict, health and education, economic growth, humanitarian disasters and emergencies) 9) Gender equality underlies all areas of development. Violence against women is a cause and a consequence of sex discrimination. The ability of women to be involved in all levels of society is directly linked to their equal status in society and we encourage DFID to recognise these connections and so support women in all areas of its programming. 10) Especially (but not only) concerning FGM, more of a focus is needed on working with and through medical practitioners. Better training and education is required so that medical practitioners' understanding of V AWG as a human rights issue is increased; they should be forbidden from performing FGM. 11) In its development assistance aid to countries, we urge DFID to push for the integration of FGM prevention and care in the reproductive health and primary care which it supports. 12) Child protection agencies should receive specialist training in relation to all forms of V AWG\u2014 including FGM, rape and sexual exploitation\u2014so that they can recognise victims, treat them with empathy and adequately assist them. Strength of UK leadership role internationally on VAWG, including the effectiveness of DFID' s work with multilateral partners and the UK' s International Champion for VAWG position 13) We urge DFID and the UK government to have a stronger focus on women affected by FGM and girls at risk of undergoing FGM who are resident in the UK. While there have been substantial efforts made thus far, more can be done, including ensuring that there is current data on FGM to inform on policy and that a comprehensive, multi-sectoral national Action Plan on FGM is designed and implemented. This includes the effective implementation of the UK law banning FGM, which will also lend more credibility to the UK's work on FGM internationally by showing that it is tackling the issue effectively at home. 14) DFID and the UK government should raise the issue of increasing medicalisation of FGM in some countries with the WHO; and encourage greater funding to WHO FGM programmes for training health professionals on FGM as a human rights and gender equality issue; WHO research on FGM should consider evaluating the implementation of the WHO strategy and protocols against medicalisation of FGM at country level. 15) DFID should encourage international agencies, such as UNICEF and UNFPA, to which it provides funding, and other government partners, to support holistic, multi-sectoral approaches that have the human rights of girls at their core and that aim at the systemic elimination of violence and discrimination against women and girls. Cross-governmental working within the UK, particularly co-operation between DFID, the FCO and the MOD on the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative and the UK Government National Action Plan on UNSCR 1325 Women, Peace and Security 16) All efforts targeted at preventing V AWG in times of conflict and promoting justice for any violence that does occur should, in line with UNSCR 1325, ensure the integral inclusion of representative women, including in peace- and nation-building. Key events in 2013: the 57th Session of the UN Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) in March, and the G8 Summit in June 17) A global legal framework for preventing V AWG has been put in place over the last several decades, both internationally and regionally. This framework includes detailed provision on the protection of women's rights such as set out in the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the CEDAW Committee's General Recommendation 19, the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women, and the Beijing Platform for Action. While governments should be commended for the progress made so far, signicant gaps in action remain. Violence, in all its forms, against women and girls persists. Millions of women and girls die, are injured, or are never born due to son preference, as a consequence of ongoing discrimination and sex inequality. As the 2015 target for achievement of the Millennium Development Goals approaches, which year also marks the 20thanniversary of the adoption by 189 governments of the Beijing Platform for Action, governments must commit themselves with renewed vigour to implementation of the international legal framework to protect women and girls from violence.Ev 68 International Development Committee: Evidence 18) As recommended in the Report of the Expert Group Meeting on Prevention of Violence against Women and Girls in Bangkok in September 2012, to encourage and support implementation and create momentum to prevent and address violence against women and girls, we urge the UK to commit, and to urge other states to commit, to undertake a Global Implementation Plan to End Violence against Women and Girls, with a particular focus on prevention, in partnership with civil society and other relevant stakeholders. The concept behind such a plan could be endorsed at the 57th session of the Commission on the Status of Women with the goal of launching the plan in 2015. 19) As the Expert Group Meeting Report states, the aim of a Global Implementation Plan to End Violence against Women and Girls could be to: (a) Intensify and scale-up global awareness of violence against women and girls as a global emergency. (b) Combine the best thinking on how to proceed with concrete pledges for action. (c) Mobilise international, regional and national action by governments, multilaterals, the private sector and civil society. (d) Build the foundation for a standardised and evidence-informed global prevention strategy. (e) Increase resources available to end violence against women and girls. Primarily, governments should be seeking to identify key areas on which they would commit to making measurable progress and on which efforts future prevention work can build. 20) The promotion and protection of the human rights of women and girls, as outlined in the international human rights framework mentioned above, is the starting point from which a global plan should be developed. Achieving gender equality, including through the prevention of V AWG, is essential to meeting other internationally agreed development goals as clearly outlined in the World Bank's 2012 World Development Report on Gender Equality and Development . Development of a global plan should therefore also be linked to the processes dening the agenda after review of the Millennium Development Goals in 2015. VAWG within the post-2015 development goals 21) Ensure a stronger commitment to equality in the post-2015 development goals, recognising that V AWG is a cause of, as well as a consequence of, gender inequality. 29 January, 2013 Supplementary written evidence submitted by Efua Dorkenoo, OBE, Advocacy Director, Equality Now FGM: UK/International Context\u2014Why They are Linked Migrants who have settled in the UK do not cut off their links with extended family relatives from country of birth. A classic example is demonstrated by the substantive amounts of money now counted in countries GDP, which y Africans in the Diaspora transfer to relatives in country of birth each year or to parents' country of birth. It is often to Africa and parts of the Middle East that British girls are taken to undergo FGM. Therefore if we want to stop FGM in the UK then we need to address FGM at its source in the developing world as well. The problem of FGM is growing partly due to increased migration of refugees from high FGM areas settling in the UK. With the opening of the borders of the European Union, refugees and migrants originally from FGM practising countries who had settled in other parts of Europe (for example, the Netherlands, Sweden, Spain and France) are moving to live in the UK. There is no doubt numerous reasons for immigrants in Europe moving to the UK but an anecdote is that the UK is viewed as a soft spot on FGM in Europe. Cross-Department working on FGM in the UK. What are the respective responsibilities of the different Departments? What should be done differently? In the years following the passing of the Prohibition of Female Genital Circumcision Act in 1985, much work on FGM in the UK focused on African women promoting dialogue and raising awareness amongst affected communities but by the end of 1990, it became clear that in addition to community engagement, FGM could be prevented by involving authorities who had contact with children and could potentially protect them. This included frontline professionals in health and in education (as FGM generally occurs during the primary school period), as well as in Social Services, the police and immigration. Some progress have been made in promoting the elimination of FGM in this country in the last three decades, evidenced by 15 NHS specialist clinics26promoting access to obstetric and gynaecological care for women with FGM and numerous community groups from affected communities promoting outreach work in their communities against FGM. The silence surrounding FGM in the UK is gradually broken and more young people (second generation) are openly speaking out against FGM. 26The futures of these clinics are in doubt due to current austerity measures and cuts in funding.International Development Committee: Evidence Ev 69 At central policy level, FGM is gradually moving from the cultural ghetto which it was assigned to; and is identied as a form of Violence Against Women and Girls (V AWG) in the \"Call to End Violence Against Women and Girls\"27which reflects the government policy and vision on V AWG, although FGM is marginalised with respect to actions in the government Action Plan on V AWG.28 The government recognises that FGM affects women in specic communities and cannot be tackled by one agency alone; and that it is something that \"needs a cross-partner response which, if possible, involves the communities concerned\". The government also identies FGM as a form of child abuse29which should be dealt with as part of existing child protection structures, policies and procedures. Since 2011, the governments departments\u2014Foreign and Commonwealth Ofce, the Home Ofce and the Department of Health have increased their activities on FGM as evidenced by the following actions: \u2014 The government published a Multi-Agency Practice Guidelines on FGM guideline is aimed at providing advice and support to frontline professionals on FGM. The Home Ofce is currently reviewing the use of the guidelines by frontline professionals. \u2014 The Home Ofce launched an FGM Fund. This was initially \u00a325,000. It had been increased to \u00a350,000. The purpose of the fund is to support community projects to tackle FGM. Applicants are able to bid for grants of \u00a32,000 to \u00a35,000 to support community engagement projects. This is quite low in comparison to the scale of the problem. \u2014 The Department of Health sent an alert to the NHS to ask all health professionals to familiarise themselves with the actions they need to take where they have reason to believe that a girl has undergone, or is at risk of FGM (Central Alert System, Female Genital Mutilation) following the Sunday Times media revelations that FGM could be occurring in the UK. \u2014 A training meeting on FGM had been held in Ethiopia to brief embassy staff from British Consulates from across Africa on FGM. \u2014 To support young girls and families resident in the UK who go abroad to resist extended family pressure, the Home Ofce produced a Statement Opposing FGM (\"Health Passport\"). The Statement is signed by the Minister of State for Crime Prevention, Home Ofce; Parliamentary Under Secretary of State, Minister for Victims and the Courts, Ministry of Justice; Parliamentary Under Secretary of State (Children and Families); and the Director of Public Prosecutions(CPS). \u2014 NHS Choices produced a short lm on FGM commissioned by the Department of Health. The aim of the lm is to raise the awareness of the public and health professionals on FGM. \u2014 The Home Ofce hosted a Round Table Meeting on FGM lead by the NSPCC. The purpose of the roundtable was to bring together key professionals working with children and to explore how professionals can work together to detect potential victims of FGM and deter those considering carrying out the act. Despite the effort cited above, girls continue to be at risk of FGM in the UK. A major gap in the government response to FGM is the fact that its work on FGM is largely crisis-driven and reactive. This sends a negative signal to the local level and to frontline workers that the government does not know what it is doing on FGM or that there is no political will to grapple with the issue. A national co-ordinator's post on FGM that functioned under FCO was abolished by the Coalition Government. A cross-governmental/NGO Forum which had been operating under the Home Ofce was also abolished and the issue was integrated into the Violence against Women stakeholder's Group which dilutes the focus on the issue. Without central government leadership and steer, policy implementation on FGM at local level is at best patchy. The government Multi-Agency Guidelines on FGM which is intended to set out a multi-agency response and strategies to encourage agencies to cooperate and work together is not a statutory document but rather an awareness raising document. Given the fact that the fact that there is no current data on FGM (the estimates on FGM quoted by the government is based on 2001 statistical estimates) and several frontline professionals are reluctant to be engaged with FGM as they view FGM as a sensitive cultural practice and fear being accused of racism,30FGM continues to be marginalised at Local Authority level and by NHS professionals. The multi-agency joined up work which is required to address the issue is not functioning. FGM is primarily a safeguarding issue but the Department of Education has been the least to participate in any of the government meetings on FGM. 27See HM Government.

A joined up approach to addressing harmful practices, Executive Summary, MOPAC. GLA, September 2011.Ev 70 International Development Committee: Evidence The key actions to be taken to strengthen current approaches to address FGM in the UK include: Strengthening Systems and Procedures That Prevent FGM \u2014 A more proactive and a comprehensive national preventative strategy is necessary to identify and respond to potential risks, involving multi-agency joined-up work between health, education and social care sectors, as well as community outreach. As the FGM cross governmental/NGO Forum had been dissolved, another potential avenue for developing this work is the Vulnerable Group Forum co-ordinated by the Home Ofce in collaboration with Health and other sectors of the government. \u2014 Equality now is very encouraged by the DPP/CPS's \"Action Plan\" to address the barriers to prosecutions on FGM. For the rst time, the action plan will lead to an outcome that could be the single most important strategy since we started discussing or campaigning on this issue. \u2014 We cannot escape the fact that there are other government departments that need to step up their actions to match what could be a turning point framework\u2014the NHS, DfE, health and social care professionals, professional regulatory bodies etc. \u2014 For health, for example, there is currently no mechanism to ensure that information gathered by one NHS body about a woman who has herself been subjected to FGM and has female children is communicated to any other part. For example, if a woman identied by a maternity unit as having undergone FGM gives birth to a daughter; there is no means by which that information can be passed to her GP and health visitor who have closer and longer contact with the woman, her family and the female children. Therefore, the opportunity for these key health professionals to take preventative action in relation to that family is lost. If education and child safeguarding measures are to be effective, the Department must ensure that information about the risk to occurrence of future FGM is communicated to those in a position to take action to safeguard girls at risk. Most of the initial FGM is performed on minors often between 7 to 8 years thus Education has a Lead role in safeguarding but currently most primary school safeguarding leads have limited knowledge on FGM. \u2014 At central government level, Education is currently disengaged from the work on FGM. The current Working Together document on Safeguarding has also dropped the reference to FGM which was a source of reference for professionals. Since PSHE is no longer compulsory, the potential avenue for empowering young people with information on FGM and V AWG schools is missed. Strengthening the Evidence Base \u2014 There are still no complete and overall data on the prevalence of female genital mutilation in the UK. The available estimates of the prevalence of FGM for England and Wales from secondary data show that 66,000 African women resident in England and Wales in 2001 had undergone female genital mutilation and more than 23,000 girls largely from African communities under the age of 15 were at risk of FGM or may well have undergone FGM. The numbers of girls and women affected by FGM are likely to have increased since 2001, as reflected in the increase in the estimated percentages of all maternities which were to women with FGM from 1.06% in 2001 to 1.43% in 2004. More recent interim estimates, which did not take account of mothers' ages, suggest a rise from 1.04% in 2001 to 1.67% in 2008, reflecting the rising numbers of births to women from FGM-practising countries. This underlines the need to update the FGM prevalence data. The practice of FGM intersects gender, race and ethnicity. Such complex issues are at risk of being sidestepped at local level by mainstream services without reliable data. \u2014 Reliable data on FGM are needed for planning and commissioning of services, to inform maternity, gynaecological and psycho-sexual care provision as well as other support services that are needed for girls and women with complications of FGM, for targeted advocacy with affected communities; and to monitor progress (trends) towards ending FGM in the UK. \u2014 Although the Department of Health has indicated its interest in including FGM in the new maternity and children data set, this does not start till April 2013. The Department acknowledges that FGM is currently not in the approved data collection so it will have to wait until a refresh of the data set in 2014.We will then have to wait till 2015 before an audit of FGM would be done. A proposal for updating the current FGM estimates which uses methodology that has been peer reviewed by researchers across Europe had been submitted by Equality Now and the City University to the Home Ofce since October 2012; but to date there had been no response from the Home Ofce, despite funding an initial research methodological workshop to determine the prevalence of FGM and requesting for the proposal. See the Addendum for further explanation of data recorded at birth and maternity care.International Development Committee: Evidence Ev 71 DFID'S work on FGM: effectiveness of work with other Departments'. Effectiveness of outreach to diaspora groups DFID Lead staff members on FGM sometimes attend cross governmental/NGO meetings on FGM. At policy level, there is a disconnect between the terminology (FGM) used in the UK by FCO, DH, Home Ofce and that by DFID which uses FGM/C\u2014an apologetic term whereas WHO, European Union, UN Women, CEDAW, Commission on the Status of Women, UN General Assembly,31African Union and African women activists use the term FGM. The use of the term FGM/Cutting reflects DFID's insecurity in upsetting developing country governments which does not bode well for its plan to take global leadership on the issue. DFID is developing a specic initiative on FGM and has involved Diaspora groups in the initial consultations on the Initiative with a view of setting a Civil Society Challenge Fund to support civil society actions in the African region. The Diaspora groups have welcomed this but have recommended that DFID does not put all its eggs in one basket but to make funding available to African women activists advocating for change against FGM in their communities. In each country where FGM persists, there a numerous local women's rights organisations working to bring about change. Equality Now believes, it is the growth of local and regional movements that can bring about social and systemic change on issues round discrimination and violence against women. FGM in developing countries: role of legislation, why this has worked in Burkina. Like other forms of violence Against Women, prevention of FGM requires a holistic approach that involves prevention, provision of care, protection and justice outcomes. A strong legal framework is a vital component in tackling discrimination against women and girls, including FGM. DFID's policies can only go so far if there is state sanctioned impunity. A key indicator for reduction of FGM is to compare the prevalence between older women (age 35-39) with that of younger women (age 15-19). In Burkina Faso, where the law is applied alongside public education, there is signicant decline in the prevalence of FGM (27%) when the prevalence of FGM between the older women age 35-39 (85.20 %) is compared to the prevalence of FGM in younger women age 15-19 (57.70 %) in the DHS 2010 for Burkina Faso (See Table A and Graph below).

Major elements include the following: \u2014 Political will. The government of Burkina Faso has endorsed the abandonment of FGM since the 1983 revolution, and continues to advocate strongly against the practice. Creation of the CNLPE in 1990 and of its permanent, government funded secretariat in 1997, as well as the adoption of a 1996 law banning the practice, have been key elements of the decline in the practice. \u2014 Multiplicity of interventions. In addition to the enforcement of anti-FGM laws, the involvement of advocates from many sectors\u2014religious leaders, policemen, medical professionals, teachers, youth, and women's associations\u2014has ensured broad diffusion of messages encouraging the abandonment of FGM. Additionally, anti-FGM messages were mainstreamed within existing development and reproductive health programs. \u2014 Outreach. A range of resources and outreach programs\u2014including awareness campaigns by mobile police and army teams, information, education, and communication projects, media exposure, and a free \"SOS Excision\" hotline for denouncing those who cut girls\u2014supported public dialogue about the issue of FGM. \u2014 However, clandestine excisions are still continuing; and most older informants still support FGM. Factors supporting continuation of the practice include deep convictions about the practice of FGM and continuing myths or beliefs about the clitoris and about the \"uncontrollable\" sexual drives of uncut girls. \u2014 Very young girls, between ages 1 and 5, may now be at greater risk, in part because they are more likely to be compliant and can be cut in secret. Utilization \u2014 CNLPE-the National government secretariat overseeing the work of FGM has used the study ndings to develop a new action plan for achieving the abandonment of FGM. 32OR Summary 72, Political Will. Law Enforcement, and Educational Campaigns Appear to Be Reducing FGM in Burkina Faso, Frontiers, Population Council 2008.International Development Committee: Evidence Ev 73 Working With Communities as in Senegal \u2014An Evaluation33 In 1998-99, a village empowerment programme was implemented in the Thi\u00e8s/Fatick and Kolda regions of Senegal by the non-governmental organization Tostan. This report is the qualitative component of an evaluation conducted at the request of UNICEF to assess the impact of this programme several years after its implementation. The overall responsibility of the evaluation was given to Macro International. The Human Development Research Centre (CRDH) implemented the quantitative component and the Population Council implemented the qualitative component, with funding from USAID through its Frontiers in Reproductive Health program. In 1998, the Tostan program was organised around the following modules: problem solving; basic hygiene; oral therapy (ORT) management); child development; democracy; and sustainable management of natural resources. The ultimate goal of the programme was to mobilise communities to hold public declarations in support of abandoning harmful traditional practices, including FGM and child marriage. The objectives of this evaluation were to assess the: Overall impact of the program implemented by Tostan on the daily life of women and men in several communities in Senegal. Post declaration phase of the program, in order to evaluate whether it is associated with actual abandonment of FGM and to estimate the magnitude and pace of abandonment. Abandonment of child marriage as it is associated with FGM. The methodology used to conduct the qualitative component of the evaluation was based on conversations and observations in two categories of villages: type A villages, which participated in the program and held a public declaration abandoning FGM; and type B villages, which had only attended a public declaration, without prior participation in the program. The Population Council conducted interviews in 12 villages, ten type A and two type B villages; this was because all other villages originally identied as type B participated in the program later. A total of 150 individual interviews were conducted among the following groups: women who had participated in the program; women from both types of villages who had not participated in the program; facilitators who had taught the program; and leaders and other resource persons in these localities. Inclusion of input from male and female leaders could result in a bias with respect to the perceptions, effects, and knowledge acquired through the program. The program was introduced in the villages in several participatory phases: dialogue, identication and selection of participants, and implementation of the program itself. Tostan set a number of criteria for village selection, having to do primarily with the village leaders willingness to feed and accommodate a program facilitator, prepare lists of program recipients, and construct a classroom facility. Some informants mentioned the abandonment of FGM as a condition for being accepted within the program but this has been reported as marginal. After delivery of the education program, it is reported that numerous changes took place in the villages. Informants reported that the program improved knowledge of rights and responsibilities among both participating and non-participating women, particularly with respect to the place and role of women in the community. The organization of public declarations evolved signicantly over time, even as early as 1996\u2014 2000. The idea of a public declaration was initially suggested by Tostan and acted upon later by the women of Malicounda, the rst village where this process took place. However, changes occurred later in the process of organizing the public declarations. In Medina Cheriff, another village that participated in a subsequent program, several other parties played an active role in the public declaration and mobilization efforts to abandon FGM. This change was guided by recognition that the implementation of the decisions announced at the public declaration required the involvement of several social groups in the villages. Information from the interviews indicates that collective determination on the part of the communities to honour these commitments, along with the support of leaders, committees and women, influenced how effective the declaration would ultimately be. However, type B villages were not truly associated with the public declarations. Some people in these villages simply heard that festivities were being held in a neighbouring village, so a few representatives decided to attend. They learned of the public declaration to abandon FGM only after their arrival. Although the dangers of early marriage were not clearly grasped in all the villages, those villages that received the full education program had a greater awareness of the dangers of FGM. This prompted the communities to call for a public declaration to abandon these practices, which was perceived as the ultimate objective of the Tostan programme. The information gathered from the communities indicates that many said they have stopped the practice following a public declaration, although residual resistance does exist in some villages. Some respondents indicated that early marriages are less frequent now, but the factors influencing this decline cannot be attributed solely to Tostan. Village committees were formed in the villages prior to implementing the educational programme. In some areas, public declarations seem to have played a role in bolstering these groups' efforts to monitor the enforcement of decisions taken at the declarations. However, at the time of the evaluation seven years later, these groups/committees no longer exist. The lack of systematic follow-up and basic infrastructure in the 33Diop, N, J et al, Evaluation of the long-term impact of the program TOSTAN programme on the abandonment of FGM/C and early marriage: Results from a qualitative study in Senegal. Final Report, Frontiers, Population Council, 2008.Ev 74 International Development Committee: Evidence villages is preventing the populations from making full use of their new capacities and is a signicant barrier hindering their ability to apply. Implications of the Two Approaches for DFID. The decline of the prevalence of FGM in the most recent data in the DHS/MICS between older (35-39) and younger (15-19) women in Burkina Faso is very stark-27% when compared with that of Senegal 5% and with other countries where there is no presence of Senegal programme-Benin (8.4%), CAR(11.1%), (8.10%), Tanzania (14.50%). These results might indicate that there is something going on more than the Senegal community programme which leads to faster reduction of the prevalence of FGM in countries. The Burkina Faso approach employed a Violence Against Women and Girls Framework in\u2014 perspective, prevention, protection and justice outcomes. The Senegal approach could be described as a component of prevention within the V AWG framework. It does not address the \"core resistors\" as shown in the evaluation results. These may be the key decision makers in the continuation of the practice. There is a danger of seeing festivities and Public Declarations as an end in itself and moving on without leaving lasting structures to maintain sustainability of programmes. Moreover, the Senegal approach may inadvertently be disempowering to African women as it reinforces the traditional view that African women cannot take individual decisions to protect themselves and their daughters against FGM without community agreement and consensus\u2014a problem faced by African women within customary laws. Policy Implications \u2014 In Burkina Faso the progress of social and behavioural changes related to FGM has resulted from long-term support from many social and government sectors. Sustainability of these changes will require continuing commitment to ensure the enforcement of laws and collaboration among the stakeholders and sectors that are seeking elimination of FGM. DFID should support other African governments to develop policy frameworks and mechanisms based on the Burkina Faso model to address FGM and V AWG. \u2014 To accelerate community action on FGM and to build strong lasting local institutions challenging FGM and other forms of harmful practices and promoting the rights of African women, DFID should fund local women's rights organisations as well as development agencies that are working at community level that have potential in integrating FGM prevention in their programmes (eg Comic Relief, Action Aid, Oxfam, Plan etc) \u2014 In areas where FGM is highly prevalent, DFID should insist that countries receiving development assistant aid for maternal, reproductive and primary health programmes mainstream FGM prevention into these programmes. \u2014 DFID should prioritise funding to advance the education of girls in FGM practising areas. 22 February 2013 Supplementary written evidence submitted by Alison Macfarlane, Professor of Perinatal Health, City University London 1.Background This note has been prepared to supplement oral evidence given to the Select Committee by Efua Dorkenoo of Equality Now, with whom I have been working for some years on estimates of the prevalence of female genital mutilation in England and Wales. 2.Data Recorded About Birth and Maternity Care in England When a baby is born in England, three sets of data are collected: 2.1 The parents register the baby's birth at their local register ofce and the information they give is analysed by the Ofce for National Statistics. Birth registration is a legal process, so no clinical information is recorded, but the parents give their place of usual residence, their dates of birth and their countries of birth. Data from this have been used in conjunction with surveys of the prevalence of female genital mutilation (FGM) in countries where it is practised, to estimate the numbers of women born in these countries and giving birth in England who are likely to have been affected by FGM.1 2.2 The baby is allocated an NHS Number and a small set of data is recorded, including the baby's ethnicity as reported by parents' or clinicians. These are now linked routinely to the baby's birth registration data. 2.3 If the birth took place in an NHS hospital and for about 12% of home births, a set of data about the delivery are recorded in the Maternity Hospital Episode Statistics (HES). This has a eld to record clinical diagnoses of complications in the mother, coded according to the International Classication of Diseases, but this classication has no code for FGM. If it had such a code, or if a special code were allocated, midwives and obstetricians could be encouraged to use it to record information which could be used to produce nationalInternational Development Committee: Evidence Ev 75 statistics on the subject. Maternity HES does not record the mother's country of birth but it would be possible to get this information by linkage with birth registration records and produce estimates of prevalence of FGM at birth tabulated by mothers' countries of birth. 3.Towards Better Data on the Prevalence of FGM 3.1 Up until now, estimates of the prevalence of FGM in England and Wales have been derived by applying data about prevalence of FGM in countries of origin to women born in those countries who have migrated to England and Wales. This means that women born here or who have migrated here from other countries are not included and is also limited by lack of data about the actual prevalence of FGM in these groups. 3.2 The Department of Health has suggested that data about FGM might be collected through the new maternity dataset it will start collecting from hospital IT systems from April 1 onwards. Instead of using codes from an international system, this datasets uses tick lists for the presence or absence of pre-specied items. FGM is not one of these, so if it were to be included, an application would have to be made to the Information Standards Board, a committee which governs NHS data collection. As this new system has yet to start, no one knows how complete or otherwise it will be and whether the data in it will be t for purpose. 3.3 Therefore in order to collect national data on the prevalence of FGM, the best approach would be to do a one-off audit of FGM among women giving birth, for a xed period in order to test potential ways of collecting data routinely about the prevalence of FGM among women who migrated to the UK from FGM practising countries and among second generation women born in the UK or other non practising countries. 3.4 A revision of the International Classication of Diseases is currently under way, so it is important to lobby WHO to include codes for female genital mutilation, subdivided according to agreed denitions. This would facilitate the routine collection of data about FGM more widely, not just in the UK. 3.5 Meanwhile, an update of previous estimates1using data from the 2011 census would give more timely estimates of the prevalence of FGM than the previous estimates based on data for 2001, but funds are needed to do this.

Foundation for Women's Health, Research and Development (FORWARD). 2007. 19 February 2013 Further written evidence from Equality Now Summary \u2014 Equality Now congratulates DFID for dedicating \u00a335 million for a programme towards ending Female Genital Mutilation in Africa and beyond. \u2014 Equality Now supports a comprehensive programme that combine targeted action with communities with support for legislative and policy change, and effective implementation of laws and policies as well as robust international research component to build the global evidence base on the most effective strategies to end FGM. \u2014 Equality Now also supports a movement within countries and globally to raise awareness and understanding of FGM and build support for efforts to end the practice, through social change communications. \u2014 However we note a number of contradictory messages in the document that might give the impression that it is not serious about the delivery of a comprehensive programme. \u2014 The document appears to show a strong bias towards the TOSTAN approach favoured by the UNJP over other approaches whilst at the same time noting the lack of robust evidence on effectiveness of interventions to end FGM. \u2014 TOSTAN is described as avoiding the topic of FGM but because in 1998 Tambacounda took up the issue \"on their own\", the project is said to (somehow but how?) \"encourage\" introduction of FGM by participants themselves. How this can work given the need for lesson plans, etc. is truly a mystery to many of us, ie how a program that claims explicitly not to address FGM can be funded as a program against FGM.Ev 76 International Development Committee: Evidence \u2014 A key indicator that FGM has stopped in the TOSTAN programme is Public Declarations and street parties. A bit of drama and singing is very common in African tradition but it is debatable that conclusions can be drawn from this that FGM has indeed stopped. Given the fact that the largest ethnic group in Senegal\u2014the Wollof (about 60% of the population), do not practice FGM and the massive investments put into TOSTAN over the last decade and half with apparently 5,000 villages stopping FGM, one would expect that FGM would have stopped completely in Senegal by now. However this is not the case. \u2014 In Senegal the latest data on national FGM prevalence (15-49%) showed only a drop about 2% over a ve year period. See the attached FGM prevalence gures between the older women and younger women which could be described as another indicator of where FGM is dropping in Africa. The areas where a good reduction had been recorded are Kenya and Burkina Faso not Senegal. \u2014 Equality Now is surprised that Burkina Faso that has shown strong political will to address FGM by implementing a comprehensive model of interventions and most importantly is beginning to show some positive results (see attachments), does not get a look in the document even as an interesting approach for examination. \u2014 Equality Now is also amazed that, with a straight face, the document can afrm it put monitoring of the TOSTAN under the aegis of the Innocenti Center in Florence whereas it should be clear to everyone that that in itself means a conflict of interest, since Innocenti and its leaders advising UNICEF are the same people who \"do\" TOSTAN. There is no way they could deliver an objective evaluation. \u2014 We would ask DFID to make sure that funding given to the UNJP goes to a wide reach of women's organizations doing targeted work in affected communities. \u2014 We would also request that future evaluation of FGM programmes need to consider issues round conflict of interest amongst researchers on FGM. Feminist researchers conversant with research on violence against women, currently missing from inputs into the UNJP on FGM will need to be part of future evaluation of impact of FGM outreach programmes. May 2013 Written evidence submitted by the Foreign and Commonwealth Ofce Introduction 1. Promoting and protecting women's rights are integral to the UK's foreign policy. Discrimination and violence affect the lives of millions of women and girls worldwide. It impedes their full participation in society and prevents them from realising their full potential. Sexual violence perpetuates division and conflict undermining international peace and security. The statistics on violence against women and girls are shocking. Globally, one in three women is beaten or sexually abused in her lifetime. 2. We know that sexual violence causes huge physical and psychological trauma. It reduces progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). And it represents one of the most serious forms of human rights violation or abuse. For all these reasons, tackling violence against women and girls is central to the Government's work overseas. 3. Through bilateral and multilateral engagement, the FCO continues to support programs and projects around the world that promote gender equality and women's empowerment and to tackle violence against women. 2013 is a hugely important year for this agenda. We have worked hard with other governments to ensure that this year's UN Commission on the Status of Women\u2014whose focus was on violence against women and girls\u2014was a success and agreed a set of robust global standards to protect women and girls from discrimination and violence. We also want to see women and girls at the heart of the new Millennium Development Goal framework published later this year. Their inclusion is critical to achieving our goal of ending extreme poverty. 4. This year will also see greater Government action to address the use of sexual violence in conflict as we further develop and implement the Foreign Secretary's Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative. Building Stability Overseas Strategy 5. The UK Government's Building Stability Overseas Strategy (BSOS) published in July 2011 sets out how the UK can enhance its own security and prosperity by identifying, preventing and ending instability and conflict overseas, using our diplomatic, development, military and security tools, and drawing on Britain's unique experience, relationships, reputation and values. It is not only in Britain's interests to intervene upstream to prevent conflict, it is also the moral course of action. The Government's work to prevent and end instability and conflict overseas takes full account of the need to promote UN Security Council resolution (UNSCR) 1325 on women peace and security, through both BSOS and the Government's National Action Plan (NAP) on UNSCR 1325 women, peace and security. BSOS conrms the government's commitment to women's central role in building stability and stresses the need to address violence against women.International Development Committee: Evidence Ev 77 The UK Government National Action Plan on UN Security Council Resolution 1325 Women, Peace and Security 6. The UK National Action Plan (NAP) for the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 (UNSCR 1325) on women, peace and security is jointly owned by the Foreign and Commonwealth Ofce (FCO), Ministry of Defence (MOD) and Department for International Development (DFID) with Stabilisation Unit. It is intended to strengthen our ability to reduce the impact of conflict on women and girls and to promote their inclusion in conflict resolution. It provides a framework to ensure that the provisions of UNSCR 1325 and subsequent resolutions are incorporated into the Government's work on conflict in our defence, diplomatic and development activity. 7. The revised February 2012 NAP includes; national actions; bilateral country action plans for Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Nepal and Afghanistan; multilateral action and a regional action plan for the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. In Afghanistan we participate in the EU Human Rights and Gender Working Group shaping its focus as it develops and implements the EU local strategy on human rights, including its work to support women human rights defenders and oppose discrimination and violence against women. Conflict Pool funds have been used to support the work of the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission to help it act to protect human rights defenders, investigate and catalogue violence towards women, and support those seeking justice. Through the European Police Mission to Afghanistan (EUPOL) we support the work of the Afghan Ministry of Interior in its efforts to increase the numbers and capacity of Family Response Units (FRU) across Afghanistan. In DRC we played an important role in the renewal of the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) mandate which has been extended until 30 June 2013. Also we have previously supported lm projects aimed at promoting positive attitudes towards women. The Conflict Pool are funding a UNDP multi-donor project to strengthen the Capacity of the National Human Rights Commission in Nepal including robust data collection systems established on patterns of discrimination against women trafcking. 8. On 31 October 2012 the second annual review of the UK Government National Action Plan on UNSCR 1325 Women, Peace and Security was laid in Parliament. Future work on Women, Peace and Security will focus on our commitments to review civil society recommendations, undertake a nal Progress Report in September 2013 and present to the Associate Parliamentary Group on Women Peace and Security a full evaluation of the NAP in 2013 to support a revision of the NAP in March 2014. 9. The FCO work on V AWG is part of a cross Whitehall effort. The FCO host regular expert level meetings of the Cross Whitehall National Action Plan on UNSCR 1325 Steering Group made up of FCO, MOD, DFID and SU representatives. FCO representatives attend the V AWG International Champion cross government meetings. Also FCO representatives attend the Home Ofce V AWG Stakeholder Meetings and the Inter- ministerial Group on V AWG. There has been effective cross government working leading up to the Commission on the Status of Women as well as the Post Millennium Development Goals. International Work 10. The Home Ofce-led V AWG Action Plan \"Call to end violence against women and girls\", which was initially solely domestically focused, now includes overseas commitments. These are: (a) Work with Governments overseas to encourage legislative and policy reform to address the structural causes of V AWG, in accordance with international commitments and (b) Continue to strongly support the ratication and lobby for the full implementation of the Committee on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and its Optional Protocol. (c) Through the Foreign Secretary's Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative, address the culture of impunity for sexual violence committed in conflict by: increasing the number of perpetrators brought to justice both internationally and nationally; strengthening international efforts and co-ordination; and supporting states to build their national capacity. (d) Take action to tackle violence against women and girls in conflict and post conflict countries through the implementation of the UK National Action Plan (NAP) on UN Security Council Resolution 1325 Women, Peace and Security, in partnership with DFID and the MOD. 11. The FCO has identied tackling V AWG overseas as one of the priorities for funding from its Human Rights and Democracy Programme Fund. We funded a wide range of projects across the world in the nancial year 2012-13 with this objective in mind. 12. We worked closely with DFID, Government Equality Ofce (GEO) and Home Ofce to ensure that strong and progressive Agreed Conclusions language was accepted at the recent Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) meeting in New York in March. In advance of CSW the FCO co-ordinated two international lobbying campaigns, sending staff at our Embassies and High Commissions across the globe in to meet their host governments and to lobby in favour of the good, progressive draft language circulated by the CSW Bureau. Once lobbying positions became clear we ran a second, more targeted, lobbying campaign, pushing for hardliners to soften their opposition to some of the more progressive language and encouraging the silent but supportive majority to be more vocal in their support for the text.Ev 78 International Development Committee: Evidence 13. We regularly work on the second international commitment on ratication of CEDAW. Ministers and Senior Government Ofcials raised implementation of international women's rights agreements with a range of countries including, Afghanistan, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Algeria, Uganda and Ethiopia in the course of the year. 14. Additionally our Embassies and High Commissions used International Women's Day (IWD) as a focus for events on the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative (PSVI) and V AWG. There were 40 blogs to mark the day\u2014by far the highest number to date for an international day. Our Press and Digital Department led an FCO/ No10/DFID collaboration to produce and populate an IWD mini-site with the UK Government's International Women's Day map. On the day itself, the Foreign Secretary issued a statement celebrating women's achievements and focused on PSVI and the upcoming G8. The FCO Women's Association (WA) also hosted an event in the FCO. All female senior Heads of Mission in London joined FCO staff along with Whitehall colleagues and NGOs in a discussion on the Foreign Secretary's Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative. Around the network, posts ran a wide range of events and initiatives to mark the day, ranging from the projection of PSVI campaign materials on the Coliseum in Rome, to expert seminars in Tokyo and Manila, to Khartoum's cultural festival as post of the \"One Billion Rising\" campaign, and Beijing Ambassador Sebastian Wood's annual reception at which the special guest was China's rst ever transgender woman. 15. The Ministerial Champion to end Violence against Women and Girls also visited Uganda and Ethiopia during 2012 and made full use of her visit to raise V AWG with her interlocutors. Other Ministers included messages on V AWG in their meetings with relevant interlocutors in the course of their regular visits overseas. The Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict Initiative 16. Sexual violence in conflict is widespread. It affects not only large numbers of women and girls but also men and boys. In addition to the physical and psychological trauma suffered by survivors, sexual violence can exacerbate ethnic, sectarian and other divisions, further entrench conflict and instability and undermine opportunities for the restoration of peace and stability. Sexual violence in conflict is a fundamental peace and security concern. 17. The Foreign Secretary launched his Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict Initiative (PSVI) on 29 May 2012. The UK Government believes there is more that can\u2014and must\u2014be done to combat this issue and particularly to address the culture of impunity for these crimes that have been allowed to develop. The Foreign Secretary's Initiative aims to address the culture of impunity by increasing the number of perpetrators brought to justice both internationally and nationally; strengthening international efforts and co-ordination; and supporting states to build their national capacity. 18. We recognise the importance of cross-government working. We continue to work closely with DFID and partners across Whitehall to ensure coherence with their V AWG work. The Government has established a new cross-departmental project team in the FCO, led by a senior civil servant, to deliver the initiative. The project team is supported by a cross-Whitehall working group who meet monthly and is overseen by an external Steering Group which pulls together a broad base of expertise on preventing sexual violence in conflict. 19. The Foreign Secretary has placed this issue on the G8 Agenda for 2013. In developing our ideas for practical G8 action, we have consulted with UN agencies, other international bodies, NGOs and faith groups. We have listened to the views expressed by the many experts (75 from over 26 countries, including six conflict and post-conflict affected countries) who attended the Wilton Park conference on this issue in November, including from various G8 countries. As a result of this wide consultation we identied four particular areas where we think greater international action, including by the G8, is necessary in order to challenge the use of sexual violence in conflict and the culture of impunity. These were (a) To improve investigations and documentation of sexual violence in conflict; (b) To provide greater support and assistance to survivors, including child survivors, of sexual violence; (c) To ensure sexual and gender based violence responses and the promotion of gender equality are fully integrated in all peace and security efforts, including security and justice sector reform; and (d) To improve international strategic co-ordination, including through the UN. 20. The \"Declaration On Preventing Sexual Violence In Conflict\" adopted by G8 Foreign Ministers on 11 April (attached) demonstrates a clear commitment to tackling the use of sexual violence in conflict and to challenge the long-standing myths that sexual violence is a cultural phenomenon or an inevitable consequence of war. The declaration is a strong message of the need to hold perpetrators to account as well as agreement on a set of practical measures to overcome the barriers that impede successful investigations and prosecutions. 21. The declaration states that rape and serious sexual violence amount to \"grave breaches\" of the Geneva Conventions such as to trigger the universal jurisdiction obligations in those treaties, meaning that perpetrators can be prosecuted wherever they are in the world, whether or not they are a national or resident of that country, and wherever the crime was committed. Ending the impunity for sexual violence is essential for any conflict or post-conflict society seeking to come to terms with past abuses, deal with present abuses and to prevent their reoccurrence.International Development Committee: Evidence Ev 79 22. 2013 presents a moment of opportunity that we must seize to galvanise greater collective action on this cause. The work at the G8 is the beginning of a longer-term effort. We will do our utmost to take the call for renewed and effective action to the UN, including to the Security Council, to NATO, to regional organisations and States as well as using our diplomatic networks and international development programmes to advance this issue. We are prepared to use the UK's Presidency of the Security Council in June to take that forward, and to make it a focus of our diplomacy at the UN General Assembly in September. 23. In line with our objectives for the Initiative, the UK has also increased its support to the UN Secretary- General's Special Representative (SRSG) on Sexual Violence in Conflict to bolster their efforts to strengthen national capacity to investigate, prosecute perpetrators of sexual violence and to protect survivors and witnesses. On 25 September 2012 the Foreign Secretary announced \u00a31 million of core funding to the SRSG's ofce. The Foreign Secretary has announced that the UK will contribute \u00a3370,000 over a three year period to the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the Department of Field Support. This nancial assistance will support the development of policies, guidance and training for use by peacekeepers as rst responders to incidents of sexual violence. On the 11 April the Foreign Secretary and Secretary of State for International Development announced further UK funding of over \u00a310 million for work on preventing sexual violence in conflict. They also announced \u00a35million from the Foreign and Commonwealth Ofce to support grassroots and human rights projects on sexual violence in conflict, as well as wider projects on violence against women and girls. The other \u00a35million is from the Department for International Development, to look at what drives violence against women and girls in emergency and conflict settings. The Foreign Secretary also announced \u00a3150,000 in UK funding for the UN Ofce of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Children and Armed Conflict. 24. In addition, we have established a specialist team of UK experts to deploy to conflict areas to support the UN and civil society to help build national capacity to investigate allegations of sexual violence and gather evidence. There are currently 73 members on the UK Team of Experts, 35 of whom are women. The team includes police, lawyers, psychologists, doctors, forensic experts, gender-based violence experts and experts in the care and protection of survivors and witnesses. These experts will be deployed to support on-going international and national efforts in priority countries. Each team will be formed in response to specic needs and will provide targeted and specialised support. 25. The Foreign Secretary's visit to DRC in March highlighted the terrible human cost of warzone rape, and called for Governments worldwide to address this neglected and growing problem. He met with survivors of rape and sexual violence and the local organisations and UN bodies supporting them, as well as political leaders to discuss the need for a lasting solution to the conflict. On the visit, the Foreign Secretary also announced commitments of \u00a3850,000 over the next three years to the Women's Initiatives for Gender Justice. This will support future collaboration between Women's Initiatives and community organisations, in the DRC and elsewhere in documenting sexual and gender based violence and in providing assistance and support to survivors. It will also support the important work they do in monitoring the approach to gender based crimes taken by the International Criminal Court. We have also agreed the sum of \u00a3200,000 to fund the work of Physicians for Human Rights in Eastern DRC. They are providing training to improve the investigative capacity of Congolese health and legal professionals. 26. The approach has been to develop deployment activity which supports the Initiative's strategic objectives and involves detailed country engagement. We require the support of partners in the eld, including national governments, and international actors. We have worked closely with the FCO network, DFID, NGOs and the UN Ofce of the SRSG-SV to identify specic contexts within which UK Team of Experts deployments can add value to on-going efforts or ll specic gaps otherwise not being addressed. Whilst the strategic objectives for each deployment will differ, the entry points for deployments will usually fall within three different categories: where we deploy with international organisations, for example into a UN mission or assessment; where we deploy to assist an NGO; and where we deploy in support of national authorities. Before deployment of any team, there is a need to clarify provisions made for the longer term needs of survivors after the team departs, ensuring linkages to existing HMG programmes wherever possible. 27. In December 2012 the rst deployment took place to assist Syrian refugees by training local health professionals in how to respond to reports of sexual violence, with the objective of improving the prospect of future investigation and potential prosecutions. So far this year the UK Team of Experts have also deployed to Bosnia-Herzegovina (BiH) to support the BiH judiciary in combating impunity for wartime sexual violence crimes and delivering justice to victims, and to Libya to conduct a detailed assessment of how the UK can provide long-term assistance to the Libyans to prevent and respond to conflict related sexual violence. Further deployments are planned to Eastern DRC to help doctors and lawyers to investigate crimes against the hundreds of women and girls who are raped each month; to Mali to strengthen the capacity of the Mali Armed Forces to protect civilians from human rights violations, including from sexual and gender based violence; and to South Sudan and the Syrian borders. April 2013Ev 80 International Development Committee: Evidence DECLARATION ON PREVENTING SEXUAL VIOLENCE IN CONFLICT Adopted in London on 11April 2013 1. Ministers welcomed the positive efforts in recent years by States, the UN, other intergovernmental organisations, local and international civil society and nongovernmental organisations to prevent and respond to sexual violence in armed conflict. Despite these efforts, sexual violence in armed conflict continues to occur. In some conflicts it is systematic or widespread, reaching appalling levels of brutality. Ministers recognised that parties to armed conflict bear the primary responsibility to take all feasible steps to ensure the protection of civilians but, as Ministers noted in Washington in April 2012, the G8 has an important role in promoting conflict prevention and resolution, including through advancing the implementation of the relevant UN Security Council resolutions on Women, Peace and Security and on Children and Armed Conflict. Sexual violence in armed conflict represents one of the most serious forms of violation or abuse of international humanitarian law and international human rights law. Preventing sexual violence in armed conflict is therefore both a matter of upholding universal human rights and of maintaining international security, in keeping with UN Security Council Resolution 1820. Ministers emphasised that more must be done to address these ongoing crimes, including by challenging the myths that sexual violence in armed conflict is a cultural phenomenon or an inevitable consequence of war or a lesser crime. 2. Ministers recognised the positive steps in holding perpetrators to account at both the national and international level including through the work of the International Criminal Court, the ad hoc and mixed tribunals, and the specialised chambers in national tribunals. But in conflict and post-conflict situations national justice systems are signicantly weakened resulting in a limited number of perpetrators facing justice. Ministers recalled that international humanitarian law maintains a long-standing prohibition of sexual violence in armed conflict and that sexual violence when it is part of a widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population can constitute a crime against humanity and can be a constitutive act with respect to genocide. They also recalled the existing normative frameworks established under UN Security Council Resolutions 1261 (1999), 1325 (2000) and 1612 (2005) and all subsequent resolutions on children in armed conflict and on women, peace and security, as well as UN Security Council Resolution 1983 (2011). Ministers expressed their full support for the work of the UN in addressing sexual violence in armed conflict, particularly that of UN Women, and for the mandates of the UN Secretary-General's Special Representatives on Children and Armed Conflict and Sexual Violence in Conflict. They welcomed, in particular, the work of the Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict to build coherence and coordination in the UN's response to sexual violence in armed conflict through UN Action against Sexual Violence in Conflict as well as her focus on national ownership and responsibility. 3. Ministers reiterated that promoting and protecting women's and children's full human rights and fundamental freedoms is critical in the ght to end all forms of sexual violence committed in conflict. Efforts to end sexual violence in conflict must also promote women's active and equal political, social and economic participation including in all conflict prevention, conflict resolution, transitional justice and security sector reform processes. Ministers underlined the importance of responding to the needs of men and boys who are victims of sexual violence in armed conflict, as well as to the needs of those secondarily traumatised as forced witnesses of sexual violence against family members. Ministers also emphasised the importance of engaging men and boys as partners in efforts to prevent and eliminate gender-based violence, including sexual violence in armed conflict, and to end the stigmatisation of victims by encouraging a change in attitudes and behaviours through promoting equality between men and women. 4. Ministers recalled that rape and other forms of serious sexual violence in armed conflict are war crimes and also constitute grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions and their rst Protocol. States have an obligation to search for and prosecute (or hand over for trial) any individual alleged to have committed or ordered a grave breach regardless of nationality. Accordingly, those accused of grave breaches should be brought to trial, in a manner consistent with international norms. There should be no safe haven for perpetrators of sexual violence in armed conflict. 5. Ministers recognised that further action at the international level is imperative to end sexual violence in armed conflict, to tackle the lack of accountability that exists for these crimes and to provide comprehensive support services to victims, be they women, girls, men or boys. Ministers undertook to work together and with others in a concerted and comprehensive campaign to raise awareness of these crimes, to strengthen international political will at the very highest levels to remove the barriers that prevent the effective monitoring and reporting on situations of sexual violence in armed conflict, to provide better support to victims, and to build both national and international capacities to respond to sexual violence in armed conflict including through investigating the crimes and prosecuting the offenders. In this regard, Ministers committed, within the parameters of their respective national programmes and priorities, to taking the actions outlined in the following paragraphs. 6. Ministers recognised that the effective investigation and documentation of sexual violence in armed conflict is instrumental both in bringing perpetrators to justice and ensuring access to justice for victims whilst protecting their safety, dignity and human rights. A common approach to the investigation and documentation of sexual violence in armed conflict by different responders that conforms to applicable international law would ensure that multiple actor efforts do not overlap or weaken or destroy evidence or information and that dueInternational Development Committee: Evidence Ev 81 consideration is given to support for victims throughout the documentation and investigative processes. Recognising the need for standard guidelines, Ministers welcomed the aims of the proposed International Protocol on the Investigation and Documentation of sexual violence in conflict and endorsed its development. 7. In defending and promoting women's and children's rights and confronting sexual violence in armed conflict, women's civil society organisations and networks, in particular women human rights defenders play a particularly important role in monitoring, fact-nding and documenting cases of sexual violence and empowering victims to pursue judicial and other remedies. They can also strengthen frontline protection, service provision and access to justice for such victims. Ministers recognised the need to afford better protection to human rights defenders and committed to support conflict-affected countries develop and implement country- level action plans with the involvement of local organisations to provide such protection. Ministers also agreed to enhance the coordination of their protection efforts in countries of concern, drawing, as appropriate, on existing guidelines such as those developed by the EU, for the protection and support of human rights defenders where applicable. 8. The provision of appropriate and accessible services, including health, psychosocial, legal and economic support is essential to support the rehabilitation and reintegration of victims of sexual violence in armed conflict and to empower them to pursue justice. This is particularly important for child victims, who can often be excluded from adult-centric programming. Ministers emphasised that all forms of humanitarian support must remain impartial and be consistent with the principle of \"do no harm\" and in accordance with the UN's Inter Agency Standing Committee Guidelines for Gender-Based Violence Interventions in Humanitarian Settings, the Minimum Standards for Child Protection in Humanitarian Action and the UN guiding principles of humanitarian assistance. Ministers stressed the importance of ensuring that a comprehensive response is included and appropriately funded in conflict, humanitarian, broader development and global health programming. Ministers emphasised the need for further funding support for victims and called on the international community, including the G8, to increase their efforts to mobilise such funding, including to programmes such as the ICC Trust Fund for Victims and its implementing partners. 9. Ministers stressed the importance of further funding for prevention and response efforts and called on the international community, including the G8, to mobilise such funding from the rst phase of conflict and humanitarian emergencies. Ministers also agreed to contribute to building the evidence base on the effective ways to prevent and respond to sexual violence in armed conflict and humanitarian emergencies. Ministers also agreed to support UN reform efforts aimed at ensuring that UN agencies and their partners meet agreed standards on gender-based violence in humanitarian settings. 10. Ministers stressed that peace and security efforts, including in humanitarian settings and post-conflict transition and reform processes, should include provisions to prevent and respond to sexual violence in armed conflict, including by holding perpetrators to account and by providing justice and redress to victims. Ministers agreed that peace negotiations and ceaseres which are supported by G8 members should include the participation of women and explicit recognition of the need to prevent, address and reduce crimes of sexual violence in armed conflict. Ministers further stressed the need to exclude crimes of sexual violence in armed conflict from amnesty provisions. Ministers undertook to promote women's involvement in all peace negotiations, peacebuilding, prevention, and accountability efforts and to ensure that such efforts also take the needs and rights of women and children into consideration. In this regard, Ministers committed to assisting conflict-affected countries in ensuring that their future national security sector and justice reform programmes are gender and child-sensitive and that they are designed to address and reduce gender-based violence, including sexual violence, and promote the full participation of women. Ministers recognised the need to promote national institutions and legal reforms that address and deter sexual violence; including through support to both state and non-state service providers where appropriate. They committed to supporting the deployment of international experts in situations of particular concern with respect to sexual violence in conflict at the request of host governments, the UN and international organisations to build national judicial, criminal investigative and legal capacity to increase the number of perpetrators brought to justice. 11. Ministers recognised that efforts to address sexual violence in armed conflict should be consistent with and support wider efforts to promote better implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 and subsequent resolutions on women, peace and security. Ministers recognised the important contribution of National Action Plans to the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1325, undertook to regularly review such Plans and committed to providing support to conflict-affected countries in the development of their Plans. 12. Ministers agreed that Governments should review the doctrine and training provided to their national military and police where appropriate to ensure that it includes training for appropriate personnel deployed to relevant theatres on the implications of rape and other forms of sexual violence in conflict and post-conflict situations. This should include, where appropriate, the training and support provided to the forces of other states. Ministers also support UN and other multilateral efforts to ensure such training is provided to international peacekeeping forces. In recognition of their particular contribution to the ght against sexual violence, Ministers called for the deployment of Women and Child Protection Advisers within appropriate UN and other peacekeeping operations and missions. In this regard Ministers stressed the importance of ensuring that such Women and Child Protection Advisers are appropriately trained and, where deployed by UN Peacekeeping missions are included on the central budgets of these missions.Ev 82 International Development Committee: Evidence 13. Ministers recognised that a cooperative approach to addressing sexual violence in armed conflict, which is often not considered a priority in the face of other pressing security and conflict concerns would clearly have greater impact. Greater coordination, particularly in support of the work of the UN and other relevant multilateral organisations, is vital to improving global efforts to meet the challenge. Ministers reafrmed their support for the mandate of the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict, including their advocacy efforts with governments and other parties to armed conflict to make and implement specic and time-bound commitments to combat sexual violence, and the development and distribution of relevant tools and resources, including by other competent authorities. Ministers also afrmed their support for the work of the Team of Experts-Rule of Law/Sexual Violence in Conflict as mandated by UN Security Council Resolution 1888. 14. Ministers recognised the need to strengthen UN efforts to address sexual violence in armed conflict and committed to provide further support to the Special Representative as chair of UN Action Against Sexual Violence in Conflict as well as to the Secretary-General's Special Representative on Children and Armed Conflict to assist in the implementation of her mandate to address sexual violence against children in armed conflict. 15. Ministers recognised the need for a continued focus on this issue and for a considered review of the implementation of the above commitments. Written evidence submitted by the International Rescue Committee Section 1:About the International Rescue Committee 1. The International Rescue Committee (IRC) works in conflict-affected and fragile countries around the world to deliver life-saving assistance to people affected by violent conflict and disaster, and remains working with communities to assist with rebuilding through the post-crisis phase. We work to empower communities to lead their own recovery and development and to restore safety, dignity and hope to millions who are uprooted and dispossessed. Our presence in over 40 countries in education, health, protection, women's protection and empowerment, and economic recovery provides us with a unique understanding of the humanitarian and development challenges in the context of conflict and fragility. 2. The IRC is recognised globally as a leader in preventing and responding to violence against women and girls (V AWG). The IRC has a dedicated Women's Protection and Empowerment Technical Unit and the IRC has been working on these issues for over 15 years and has programming in 20 countries. The IRC is amongst the rst on the ground when a crisis hits and we ensure that V AWG programmes are part of the rst-line response. We are the only agency that has V AWG specialists that deploy in the rst 72 hours of emergency responses. In the last 18 months alone, our V AWG experts have led humanitarian responses in eleven countries (C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Libya, Egypt, Kenya, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Jordan, Niger, Lebanon, Jordan and DRC). In October 2012 we hosted a high level roundtable on V AWG in emergencies with decision makers including DFID. Section 2:Introduction 3. The IRC welcomes the International Development Select Committee's decision to conduct an inquiry into V AWG at a time where DFID is scaling up investment and there is increasing cross-government political attention on this important issue. With more political will than ever before, it is vital that investments are used for maximum benet to women and girls. 4. The UK Government has made positive progress on addressing V AWG overseas in recent years. There have been a number of policy documents developed and commitments made including: \u2014 The Cross-Government VAWG Strategy and Action Plan which includes an international section that sets out concrete actions to tackle V AWG internationally; \u2014 An explicit commitment in DFID's Business Plan 2011-15 to approve new programmes to prevent V AWG; \u2014 The inclusion of V AWG as one of four pillars for action in DFID's Strategic Vision for Girls and Women ; \u2014 The 2012 revision of the UK National Action Plan for the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1325 on Women, Peace and Security ; \u2014 The Cross-Government Building Stability Overseas Strategy which references V AWG; \u2014 Reference to tackling V AWG in the Humanitarian Emergency Response Review (HERR); \u2014 The appointment of a UK Ministerial Champion on international violence against women and girls, Lynne Featherstone MP in 2010. \u2014 The UK government has also shown strong leadership through committing to investing \u00a325 million over ve years on a V AWG Research and Innovation Fund.34 34For more information on the fund please see: http://www.dd.gov.uk/News/Latest-news/2012/Helping-millions-of-women-and- girls-access-better-justice-and-support-against-violence/International Development Committee: Evidence Ev 83 5. DFID has invested in strengthening the implementation of these policies and is supporting country ofces to deliver programmes that effectively address V AWG\u2014for example, through the development of a DFID theory of change for tackling V AWG35and related programme guidance. 6. However, whilst V AWG is currently a priority issue for DFID, to date the focus for V AWG work has been primarily on more 'development' programming. Less progress has been made on ensuring that tackling V AWG is a high priority in humanitarian contexts. The IRC's written evidence will focus primarily on what DFID can do to improve its humanitarian response and institutionalise addressing V AWG in humanitarian contexts as a priority. The submissions will cover: \u2014 Why V AWG is lifesaving, not optional \u2014 Why a more nuanced understanding of access to justice is required \u2014 Coordination and integration of DFID's work on V AWG with other areas of DFID \u2014 DFID's leadership role internationally 7. The IRC has also fed into the Gender and Development network's submission on V AWG. Section 3:Summary of recommendations 8. Recognise that preventing and responding to violence against women and girls in emergencies is lifesaving, not optional i. Ensure that V AWG is a criteria for disbursing humanitarian funds, for example through the rapid response facility (RRF) and GRAP. ii. Continue to ensure that funding for both integrated and specialised services for survivors of V AWG are made available and considered lifesaving at the onset of humanitarian crises. Even where there has been some support on V AWG (eg Syria and DRC) from donor governments such as the UK\u2014 the critical needs of women and girls continues to outstrip the funding allocated. iii. Adhere to the IASC guidelines on addressing GBV in humanitarian settings36by assuming that violence is occurring and fund response programmes, even in the absence of data or reported incidents. Donors such as DFID should fund an initial set of response activities from the outset focusing on establishing or strengthening services and mitigating immediate risks to women and girls. iv. Support survivors of all forms of violence against women and girls, and not just sexual violence. Donors such as DFID should recognise domestic violence as a humanitarian issue37, and support social and economic resources programmes that provide women and girls with relevant and needed material goods and economic support to reduce exploitative jobs and survival sex. v. Support inter-agency needs assessments that outline the scale of funding required to meet minimum standards of V AWG prevention and response rather than documenting prevalence. 9. Use leadership on V AWG to influence partners and international processes i. The UK Government should routinely ask multilaterals and other recipients of UK aid to report back on how they are responding to and tackling violence against women and girls as part of their monitoring frameworks. ii. Donors such as DFID should invest in building the capacity of the humanitarian community to ensure that implementing organisations have the commitment and investment needed to meet the minimum standards on V AWG prevention and response across all programming regardless of whether it has an intentional focus on V AWG. iii. Donors such as DFID should push UN agencies to take leadership on V AWG as a key protection concern. This means that at the beginning of an emergency, UN agencies should ensure that GBV coordination bodies are established, resourced and staffed with qualied, senior level GBV coordinators. iv.Post MDG framework : Along with the Gender and Development network we would like to see the UK promoting the inclusion of a specic target on ending V AWG as part of a dedicated standalone goal on gender equality. v.Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative: The IRC welcomes the FCO's PSVI and we are pleased that the FCO and DFID are now exploring how they can best address the question of greater international support for survivors. As part of the UK's presidency of the G8, they should push G8 development partners to support the inclusion of direct responses to V AWG in all emergency and humanitarian response. Whilst it is important that impunity is addressed, the attention that the PSVI garners on this issue should be used to ensure women and girls are safe and have the frontline services in place to support their healing and recovery\u2014beyond the life of the UK's G8 presidency. 35DFID, Theory of Change on VAWG (2012) http://www.dd.gov.uk/Documents/publications1/how-to-note-vawg-1.pdf 36IASC Guidelines for Gender-Based Violence Interventions in Humanitarian Settings (2005) accessed here: http://ochanet.unocha.org/p/Documents/GBV%20Guidelines%20(English).pdf 37For more information please see the IRC's Let me not die before my time ,domestic violence in West Africa (May2012)Ev 84 International Development Committee: Evidence Section 4:Preventing and Responding to Violence Against Women and Girls is Lifesaving, Not Optional 10. V AWG is widely recognised as a manifestation of unequal power relations between women and men38 and exists across the world regardless of context. However, threats to women's safety, health and empowerment become more acute during conflict, natural disaster and displacement. Destruction, flight and upheaval erode the limited protections women and girls have even in times of stability. There is now a wealth of evidence which conrms that V AWG is a predictable and common threat in emergencies and that we should assume it is taking place regardless of the presence or absence of concrete and reliable evidence. Indeed, there are Inter- Agency Standing Committee (IASC) guidelines for gender based violence39interventions in humanitarian settings40to 'inform and sensitise the humanitarian community to the existence of GBV during emergencies [and] that it is a serious and life threatening protection issue'41. 11. When crisis hits, women and girls are at enormous risk of physical, sexual and emotional violence\u2014 from armed groups, from strangers, from neighbours and from family members. Whilst focus in conflict areas has been on sexual violence and in particular, rape, V AWG covers a range of forms of abuse. A recent IRC report on Syria42notes that as well as sexual violence, there have been accounts of women trading sex for food and desperate families selling their girls into early marriage to reduce household numbers or pay rent. Domestic violence in refugee communities has also been exacerbated by the economic stress and poor living conditions43. 12. Despite this knowledge and the increased focus on V AWG, particularly during armed conflict44, there has been a global and systematic failure to protect women and girls in humanitarian contexts\u2014both in terms of preventing V AWG (particularly through ensuring that other sectors such as food, water and sanitation, shelter etc. minimise risk of V AWG in their own programming) and in providing safe services for survivors. 13. Specialised and integrated services for survivors of V AWG are often sidelined and deprioritised in order to provide what the humanitarian community considers 'urgent' assistance\u2014shelter, food, water and medical care. Whilst these are vital parts of humanitarian response, services for survivors of V AWG are also urgently needed and should be considered lifesaving: \u2014 When a woman has experienced violence she may have just a few hours to ensure that life- threatening injuries do not become fatal \u2014 When a woman has been raped, she has just three days to access care and prevent the potential transmission of HIV \u2014 When a woman has been raped she has just vedays to prevent unwanted pregnancy \u2014 The earlier a survivor can access emotional support (eg through psychosocial counselling) the easier it will be for her to heal and recover 14. In Haiti , despite an unprecedented amount of rhetoric on V AWG, there was limited effective action to protect women and girls. In the revised flash appeal, out of $1.4billion of funding foreseen for January to December 2010 only 4.4% of it went to protection (in general) with the amount going to V AWG programming even smaller45. Attempts to mitigate risks to women posed by poorly placed latrines, unsafe shelter or inequitable access to goods were considered either unrealistic or not a priority for the sectors involved46.A s a result, in May 2011, 16 months after the earthquake, UNHCR released a report showing that sexual abuse and exploitation were widespread mainly because women and girls could not obtain the goods and services they needed to survive. Issues of V AWG continue to exist in Haiti three years after the earthquake and there continues to be alarmingly limited services and support to women and girls. 15. In Pakistan after the floods in summer 2010, women were absent from most of the early humanitarian reports on the disaster. Initial appeals and assessments made little reference to V AWG, if any at all. In late 2010, the World Food Programme reported that 60% of women felt that they did not have enough privacy to use the toilet and 80% did not have enough privacy to breastfeed47. The revised flash appeal called for almost 38United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women , A/RES/48/104, Article 1; UN Women, ESCAP, UNDP, UNFPA and WHO, 2012, Report of the Expert Group Meeting on Prevention of Violence against Women and Girls, Bangkok, Thailand, 17-20 September 2012 39This submissions prefers to use violence against women and girls (V AWG) but uses gender based violence (GBV) where it refers to a well established resource or mechanism that uses GBV (i.e. IASC guidelines for GBV interventions in humanitarian settings). 40IASC Guidelines for Gender-Based Violence Interventions in Humanitarian Settings (2005) accessed here: http://ochanet.unocha.org/p/Documents/GBV%20Guidelines%20(English).pdf 41IASC, Guidelines for Gender-Based Violence Interventions in Humanitarian Settings (2005) accessed here: http://ochanet.unocha.org/p/Documents/GBV%20Guidelines%20(English).pdf 42IRC, Syria: A regional Crisis.

A July 2011 InterAction review of violence against women funding found that of the projects submitted for GBV , none were funded48. 16. The drought in Kenya in 2011 led to Dadaab refugee camp shifting from a protracted refugee situation to an emergency one. The majority of new arrivals were women, travelling either alone, or with children, through a border region lled with armed groups and bandits. Not only were the camps overcrowded, but newly arrived women and girls were living in outskirt areas away from the protection of the ofcial Dadaab camp. As a result, they had inadequate access to assistance or services, and travelled far to get water and rewood in a drought-ridden region. As the population swelled, Dadaab, a refugee camp where V AWG has always been a severe problem, became even less safe for women and girls. As new refugees increased the level of need, V AWG programming did not keep apace. In December 2010, when two NGO workers were abducted, all INGOs reduced their presence and the focus was placed on 'lifesaving' assistance. V AWG was not considered in that 'lifesaving' category. The situation in Dadaab has continued to deteriorate, Between February and May 2012, the number of cases of V AWG reported to IRC increased by 36% while IRC's funding was cut in half49. 17. In the DRC, reported cases of V AWG increased in the recent upsurge of violence and displacement starting in May 201250. Despite increased international attention and media reporting of the DRC as the 'rape capital of the world'51, V AWG has not been prioritised by the humanitarian community in the most recent emergency response. International attention, particularly to sexual violence in the DRC, has resulted in some increases in resources and funding being dedicated to V AWG programmes. However, because the level of funding is perceived as high there is an assumption that it covers all the needs of women and girls. This is not the case, particularly in emergency spikes. The UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) did not include V AWG programmes in either the Rapid Response or Underfunded Emergencies allocations in 2012. Of the total $31,486,288 allocated to DRC between January and October 2012, protection received less than 1%.52 In 2011, of the total 30 projects and $15,747,064 allocated to North Kivu through the pooled fund, only one project specically mentioned sexual violence or any other form of V AWG ($298,550 or less than 2%).53 18. These four examples above show that: \u2014 V AWG is not prioritised as part of lifesaving humanitarian response in emergencies : Internationally accepted guidelines outline clearly that humanitarian agencies 'should assume that GBV is taking place, that it is a serious and life threatening protection issue, regardless of the presence or absence of concrete and reliable evidence54. And yet this standard is rarely upheld. Qualitative data is seen as 'anecdotal' and most donors, including DFID, normally require that V AWG cases be reported at a scale that is deemed response-worthy before they fund programmes and take action. The highly sensitive nature of sexual violence and other forms of V AWG means that data collection can result in harm to the physical, psychological and social well-being of women and can even put their lives at risk. Women are much more likely to report V AWG if there are services in place. Where there are no services in place, women are much less likely to report V AWG\u2014perpetuating the impression that there is little evidence of V AWG and providing the 'evidence' for no action and funding to provide services for survivors of V AWG. For example, our experience in a number of humanitarian responses, including the Syria regional response, has been that initial assessments have found no or limited 'evidence' of V AWG. However, as soon as the IRC set up services, we had women and girls accessing them. \u2014 V AWG programmes are scarcely funded at the outset of emergencies . As well as the examples given above, a snapshot of flash appeals in Haiti, Pakistan and Mali show that V AWG programming represents 1% or less of all requested funding. Although these appeals are not comprehensive of all funding requested or provided they do give an indication of donor and NGO priorities. A similar funding trend is evident in refugee response plans. UNHCR appeals for the Syria crisis and for the Sudanese refugees coming into South Sudan show a funding request for V AWG of 4% or less. 19. The Humanitarian Emergency Response Review55(HERR) highlights the importance of addressing V AWG in humanitarian response. DFID have made a number of commitments in response to the HERR\u2014 including enhancing the skill-set of the humanitarian cadre and ensuring that UK humanitarian aid prevents and responds to V AWG56. This commitment was reiterated in a speech in November 2012 by the DFID 48InterAction, Pakistan brieng (2011) 49IRC, Lifesaving, not optional: Protecting women and girls from violence in emergencies (2012) accessed here: www.rescue- uk.org/ditchley2012 53Common Humanitarian Fund, The Democratic Republic of Congo. 2011 Annual Report : Annex.

In both the recent DRC and Syria humanitarian response, DFID have taken welcome steps to ensure that specialised V AWG programming is funded at the outset of an emergency. However, these examples are the exceptions rather than the rule. Understanding of why V AWG should be part of DFID's humanitarian programming\u2014particularly in the early stages of an emergency\u2014is still weak across DFID, including at the country ofce level and with humanitarian advisers. In order to ensure early and lifesaving action to prevent and respond to V AWG in emergencies, the UK government should: i. Ensure that V AWG is a criteria for disbursing humanitarian funds, for example through the rapid response facility (RRF) and GRAP. ii. Continue to ensure that funding for both integrated and specialised services for survivors of V AWG are made available and considered lifesaving at the onset of humanitarian crises. Even where there has been some support on V AWG (eg Syria and DRC) from donor governments\u2014the critical needs of women and girls continues to outstrip the funding allocated. iii. Adhere to the IASC guidelines on addressing GBV in humanitarian settings58by assuming that violence is occurring and fund response programmes, even in the absence of data or reported incidents. Donors such as DFID should fund an initial set of response activities from the outset focusing on establishing or strengthening services and mitigating immediate risks to women and girls. iv. Support survivors of all forms of violence against women and girls, and not just sexual violence. Donors such as DFID should recognise domestic violence as a humanitarian issue,59and support social and economic resources programmes that provide women and girls with relevant and needed material goods and economic support to reduce exploitative jobs and survival sex. v. Support inter-agency needs assessments that outline the scale of funding required to meet minimum standards of V AWG prevention and response rather than documenting prevalence. Section 5 :Nuanced understanding of access to justice 21. DFID's gender vision outlines that DFID's work on V AWG will focus on 'supporting interventions to reform and strengthen security services, police, and policy and decision making bodies to improve women's access to security and justice services'. They state that they aim to 'help 10 million women to access justice through the courts, police, and legal assistance' and 'increase the number of survivors who have access to treatment and advice, and whose cases are satisfactorily investigated'. 22. DFID is currently developing a security and justice theory of change on VAWG and we hope that this recognises that in the early stages of an emergency, it may not be feasible to link women with justice actors\u2014 such as the police and courts\u2014in part because justice systems and structures may have disintegrated as a result of the emergency. There are options such as police training that may in the longer-term serve as both a prevention and a response mechanism, but in an acute crisis focus should be on mitigating risks and responding to the health and psychosocial needs of survivors. However, if there are already existing, active, trained, and safe legal justice options, these should be factored into the referral pathway. 23. Pursuing 'justice' whether through formal or more informal mechanisms is a survivor's choice. As part of a survivor-centred approach, policy should respect women's condentiality and decisions in regards to the incident. For example, this includes if they decide not to immediately, or ever, pursue a case against the perpetrator(s). Further, services should be provided to all women and girls that are survivors of violence\u2014 regardless of their desire to pursue prosecution ie services should not be an incentive for prosecution. Section 6:Coordination and integration of DFID's work on VAWG with other areas of DFID programming (including disasters and emergencies) 24. DFID has invested in knowledgeable experts within DFID to lead on V AWG. The V AWG pillar leads sit within the Security and Justice team in CHASE and have raised both the prole of the issue inside and outside of DFID, as well as supported building the technical capacity of DFID staff, particularly in country, to programme on V AWG. 25. However, V AWG can be siloed even with the DFID CHASE team. It is vital that V AWG is seen as a priority issue across contexts\u2014including in humanitarian contexts\u2014and work carried out by the V AWG leads should involve DFID CHASE's humanitarian response group. 26. Further, additional investment in building staff expertise on V AWG, particularly in humanitarian contexts, is needed. We welcome DFID's efforts to expand its technical capacity on V AWG via helpdesks and in-country advice but much more should be done to build the in-house capacity of staff including humanitarian advisers. DFID should consider a minimum training on V AWG before staff can be deployed overseas. 57Please see speech here:http://www.dd.gov.uk/News/Speeches-and-statements/2012/Justine-Greening-Eliminating-violence- against-women-and-girls/ 58IASC, Guidelines for Gender-Based Violence Interventions in Humanitarian Settings (2005) accessed here: http://ochanet.unocha.org/p/Documents/GBV%20Guidelines%20(English).pdf 59IRC, Let me not die before my time ,domestic violence in West Africa (May2012)International Development Committee: Evidence Ev 87 Section 7:DFID's leadership role internationally 27. DFID is a powerful champion on V AWG internationally. We have welcomed the priority that DFID has placed on working in partnership with other governments to ensure that the 57th UN Commission on the Status of Women has strong agreed conclusions on V AWG. As a key donor, we would also like to see DFID play a strong role in holding their partners to account on V AWG. 28. In the recent 'mini' multilateral aid review DFID conducted, very few partners were assessed on 'gender' let alone their commitment to preventing and responding to V AWG. Furthermore, as outlined in section 4, humanitarian funding is often channelled through pooled funds. These pooled funds are not transparent and have limited accountability mechanisms on V AWG. V AWG programming through these funding mechanisms must be made more visible in order to monitor resource commitment as well as to understand funding gaps or trends. 29. This coming year brings a host of opportunities for the UK government to play a leadership role on V AWG. As well as the UN Commission of the Status of Women, we hope that DFID makes the most of the opportunity of developing the post-2015 MDG framework and the global attention that the FCO's Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative (PSVI) is generating. 30. Recommendations: i. The UK Government should routinely ask multilaterals and other recipients of UK aid to report back on how they are responding to and tackling violence against women and girls as part of their monitoring frameworks. ii. Donors such as DFID should invest in building the capacity of the humanitarian community to ensure that implementing organisations have the commitment and investment needed to meet the minimum standards around V AWG prevention and response across all programming regardless of whether it has an intentional focus on V AWG. iii. Donors such as DFID should push UN agencies to take leadership on V AWG as a key protection concern. This means that at the beginning of an emergency, UN agencies should ensure that GBV coordination bodies are established, resourced and staffed with qualied, senior level GBV coordinators. iv.Post MDG framework : Along with the Gender and Development network we would like to see the UK promoting the inclusion of a specic target on ending V AWG as part of a dedicated standalone goal on gender equality. v.PSVI: The IRC welcomes the FCO's PSVI and we are pleased that the FCO and DFID are now exploring how they can best address the question of greater international support for survivors. As part of the UK's presidency of the G8 they should push G8 development partners to support the inclusion of direct responses to V AWG in all emergency and humanitarian response. Whilst it is important that impunity is addressed, the attention that the PSVI garners on this issue should be used to ensure women and girls are safe and have the frontline services in place to support their healing and recovery\u2014beyond the life of the UK's G8 presidency. February 2013 Written evidence submitted by the Department for International Development Why Addressing Violence Against Women and Girls is so Important 1. The statistics on violence against women and girls are shocking. Globally, one in three women is beaten or sexually abused in her lifetime. Usually, the abuser is a member of her own family or someone she knows; and up to 50% of sexual assaults are committed against girls under 16. 2. Violence against women and girls (V AWG) reduces progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and violates women and girls' human rights. Girls who experience violence are less likely to complete their education. It reduces women's ability to earn a living. And it signicantly increases the risk of maternal death and vulnerability to HIV and AIDS. 3. During conflict and humanitarian crises, the incidence of physical and sexual violence can dramatically increase. Women and girls face increased risk from armed groups, from strangers, from neighbours, and from family. In eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, for example, at least 200,000 cases of sexual violence have been documented since 1996. 4. Despite increasing attention to violence against women and girls in crisis situations, it is still rarely prioritised in humanitarian responses. For example, out of $1.4 billion funding requested for the emergency in Haiti in 2010, only $5 million\u2014less than 1%\u2014was earmarked for addressing violence against women and girls. 5. Violence against women and girls is the most widespread form of systemic abuse and there is no evidence that levels of violence against women and girls are decreasing.Ev 88 International Development Committee: Evidence Tackling Violence against Women and Girls is a DFID and Cross Government Priority 6. Preventing violence against women and girls is a top priority for the Coalition Government and the DFID Ministerial team. 7. Access to justice is a key priority and DFID programmes will increase access to justice for 10 million women by 2015. 8. DFID is investing up to \u00a325 million over ve years in a new Violence against Women and Girls Research and Innovation Fund. This pioneering Fund will drive innovation, generate ground-breaking new evidence, and support new prevention programmes. 9. The next Commission of the Status of Women (CSW 57) and the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative (PSVI) are both important examples of cross Government prioritisation of work to tackle violence against women (further detail on p3). The Ministerial Champion for Tackling Violence against Women and Girls Overseas (International Champion) 10. Lynne Featherstone was appointed by the Prime Minister as Ministerial Champion for tackling violence against women and girls overseas in November 2010 alongside her role as Home Ofce and Equalities Minister. On moving to DFID in September 2012 and becoming DFID's Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (PUSS), it was agreed that she would continue as International Champion. The purpose of the role is to represent the UK on tackling V AWG overseas and ensure related policy coherence and co-ordination across Whitehall Departments. 11. The International Champion's objectives for 2013 are to: \u2014 Champion and drive forward international progress towards eliminating violence against women and girls. \u2014 Coordinate activity and messaging on V AWG across HMG, ensuring Parliamentarians and Ministers make reference to V AWG in statements and speeches at home and abroad as appropriate. 12. As International Champion and DFID Minister, the PUSS leads and supports work across HMG's international portfolio but will focus on the following priority areas for 2013: \u2014 Prevention and building the global evidence base on what works to tackle violence against women and girls (eg through DFID's upcoming Research and Innovation Fund of up to \u00a325 million). \u2014 Eradication of Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C). \u2014 Tackling all forms of violence against women and girls in humanitarian crisis and conflict situations. Including ensuring that tackling V AWG is seen as a crucial rst response to any humanitarian crisis and championing the importance of incorporating comprehensive services for survivors of sexual violence into all phases of humanitarian response. She will also oversee the implementation of the National Action Plan (NAP) on UNSCR 1325 and support the Foreign Secretary's Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative (PSVI). 13. Governance arrangements: going forward DFID will chair a steering group meeting of ofcials from the Home Ofce, Government Equalities Ofce, Foreign Ofce and Ministry of Defence to support the International Champion and provide cross Government coordination. Cross Government Commitments 14. DFID's work on V AWG is part of a cross Whitehall effort. DFID contributes to the delivery of the Home Ofce led \"call to end violence against women and girls action plan\". This action plan provides an overview of the wide range of actions the Government is taking forward with key partners to deliver its strategy to tackle V AWG. The overarching strategic narrative was set out in Call to End Violence against Women and Girls on 25 November 2010. It makes a long-term commitment to work towards the prevention of V AWG and recognises that it is an international issue which occurs in all countries and crosses borders. DFID actions include: supporting UN Women in their work to deliver progress for women and girls worldwide; ensuring the UK humanitarian action prevents and responds to V AWG and working with partners to improve and communicate the evidence base on V AWG. 15. The UK has developed a National Action Plan on UNSCR 1325 Women, Peace and Security (NAP). The NAP is jointly owned by the Ministry of Defence, Foreign and Commonwealth Ofce and DFID. It is intended to strengthen the UK's ability to reduce the impact of conflict on women and girls and to promote their inclusion in conflict resolution. 16. The NAP includes national actions, multilateral actions and bilateral country action plans for three countries, Afghanistan, DRC and Nepal as well as a plan for the Middle East and North Africa Region. The most recent Annual Review published in October 2012 sets out how DFID contributes to the delivery of theseInternational Development Committee: Evidence Ev 89 actions. As an example, in Afghanistan, DFID provides grants to 15 women's organisations taking forward a range of projects focusing on tackling violence against women, improving justice, conflict resolution and peace building. International Opportunities for Change in 2013 17. 2013 offers several opportunities to make signicant international progress to tackle violence against women and girls. The focus of the 57th session of the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) in March 2013\u2014the key global policy body for the advancement of women\u2014is the elimination and prevention of all forms of violence against women and girls. The UK is working hard with other international partners and UK NGOs to ensure that CSW is a success. The UK goal for CSW is to agree a common set of global standards to protect women and girls from discrimination and violence. This is all the more critical in a climate where there is a risk of losing hard won gains in progress on women's rights, including sexual and reproductive health and rights. 18. 2013 is also the year when the UK takes the Presidency of the G8. The Foreign Secretary's Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative (PSVI) is a concrete example of the commitment we are showing in this area. The objective of the Initiative is to increase the number of perpetrators brought to justice both internationally and nationally; strengthen international efforts and co-ordination; and support states to build their national capacity to prosecute acts of sexual violence committed during conflict. 19. The Foreign Secretary will convene the G8 Foreign Ministers' meeting in April 2013 with the intention of securing a clear political statement from the G8 of its determination to make real, tangible progress on combating the use of sexual violence in conflict. In addition, the UK will seek a wider set of practical commitments to overcome the barriers that impede the implementation of the existing international legal framework and prevent successful investigations and prosecutions. 20. DFID is working closely with the FCO on the PSVI, in particular helping to shape the work in conflict affected countries. A DFID member of staff was seconded to the PSVI team last August. DFID will help to support and feed into a FCO-led side event at CSW57 in March, which will aim to raise the international prole of PSVI and encourage wider engagement on the issue of sexual violence in conflict. 21. Next summer, the Prime Minister, along with UN High Level Panel co-chairs President Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia and President Yudhoyono of Indonesia, will publish recommendations for a new international framework for development when the current MDGs expire in 2015. Issues of violence and security, and how they relate to women, are likely to be a key theme in discussions of the post 2015 framework. Women and girls must be at the heart of the post 2015 new MDG framework if the international community is to achieve its goal of ending extreme poverty. 22. The High Level Panel, and ultimately, the UN General Assembly will need to consider whether to mainstream gender throughout the post 2015 development goals and/or develop a stand-alone gender goal. Wide consensus from like-minded governments, civil society (North and South), donor agencies and UN Women is that it is important to have both. While ending violence against women and girls is understood as a strategic priority for achieving gender equality and other MDGs, overall, it is often named as \"missing target\" in the current MDG framework and is expected to feature centrally in the post 2015 discussions. DFID's Organisational Response to VAWG 23. The UK Government has put women and girls at the heart of its international development work. DFID's Strategic Vision for Girls and Women sets out four priority areas for action: \u2014 Delay rst pregnancy and support safe child birth; \u2014 Improve economic opportunities for girls and women; \u2014 Get girls through primary and secondary school; and \u2014 Prevent violence against women and girls. 24. The Strategic Vision also sets out the UK's commitment more widely to improve the enabling environment for girls and women, for example to challenge social norms and behaviours which perpetuate violence and inequality, to support girls' and women's ability to speak out safely and to strengthen legal frameworks which protect women's rights. These are all critical to both preventing, and responding to, violence against girls and women. See diagram. How is the Strategic Vision embedded in DFID? 25. The Senior Girls and Women Strategy Group (GWSG) is chaired at Director-General level and brings together a number of Directors. It maintains the strategic overview of DFID's work to support girls and women. It promotes an integrated approach to taking forward work across the four pillars of the Strategic Vision and the enabling environment; consolidates and shares best practice and innovation; and unblocks challenges. 26. Senior Divisional Gender Champions are appointed in each Division. Senior Divisional Gender Champions are responsible for ensuring Divisional results are reported to Directors. They play a key role inEv 90 International Development Committee: Evidence facilitating formal and informal links between their Divisions (for example through divisional gender networks) and the Girls and Women Strategy Group to share innovation, best practice and results. 27. The Policy Division (PD) Gender Team oversees the implementation of the Strategic Vision in DFID and across the pillars and the enabling environment, facilitating cohesion across the strategy, chairing GWSG meetings and producing the annual progress report. It leads on sharing evidence, innovation and best practice on the enabling environment . 28.Girls and Women Pillar Leads are the technical experts in the four policy areas of the Strategic Vision pillars. Within their pillar area, they work closely with regional/country colleagues to: maintain a strategic overview of DFID's work; establish DFID communities of practice; share evidence, innovation and best practice; provide technical/peer support for Business Case development; and develop new policy resources and evidence. DFID's Commitment to Delivering Real Change on the Ground 29. Since the publication of the Strategic Vision in March 2011, DFID has increased its work in this area. In September 2011 the V AWG portfolio was moved from Policy Division to Conflict, Humanitarian and Security Group (CHASE) in order to locate the agenda closer to the policy/technical teams working on security and justice and women, peace and security. DFID developed, in collaboration with Action Aid and Womankind, aViolence against Women and Girls Theory of Change published last May. The theory of change gives DFID and HMG an overarching framework in which to map, evaluate, and inform the development of programme interventions across the contexts in which DFID works . 30. The Theory of Change on ending gender-based violence against women and girls consists of a diagram (see below) and accompanying narrative. Together they provide an overview of the interventions, outputs and outcomes that can reduce and ultimately eradicate violence against women and girls. The seven key principles underlying the Theory of Change are that: \u2014 Context is critical; \u2014 The state has primary responsibility for action on violence against women and girls;International Development Committee: Evidence Ev 91 \u2014 Holistic and multi-sectoral approaches are more likely to have impact; \u2014 Social change makes the difference; \u2014 Backlash is inevitable but manageable; \u2014 Women's rights organisations (WROs) create and sustain change; and \u2014 Empowering women is both the means and the end. Ev 92 International Development Committee: Evidence Scaling up country programmes 31. As part of DFID's efforts to scale up programming on violence against women and girls, we are now working in 20 countries to directly address violence against women and girls. (A full mapping of DFID's V AWG programmes is available on request). 32. Work on preventing violence against women is also on-going within DFID regional programmes , which include Raising her V oice, Asia Regional Trafcking Programme, Making Every V oice Count for Gender Equality in Southern Africa, ASTI Tackling Acid Violence Programme and the UN Women Peace and Security Programme. 33. Across civil society funding streams, DFID is also funding V AWG work through mechanisms such as Programme Partnership Agreements (PPAs), the Global Poverty Action Fund (GPAF) and through the Civil Society Challenge Fund (CSCF). Through PPAs, DFID currently funds a wide variety of work on V AWG with Plan UK, Womankind Worldwide, Oxfam, IPPF, Article 19, Gender Links and Action Aid. 34. In total, through bilateral and regional programmes and civil society funding, DFID is currently funding approximately 118 separate interventions on V AWG across 68 countries. Country programmes 35. In Nepal, through a \u00a36.5 million over four years, DFID is working to improve access to justice for women and girls through local level paralegal committees. Paralegals are important members of the legal team, playing key roles in the legal process and actively helping to empower women through increasing awareness of their rights and entitlement. This has enabled over 18,000 cases to be heard in the past two years. 36. In Somalia, DFID is helping to ensure that Somali women and girls have better access to higher quality justice through providing free legal aid and advice. Through supporting the UNDP Access to Justice Project, last year more than 100 survivors of sexual violence were heard and resolved as a result of support through a sexual assault referral centre in Somaliland and Puntland. Further achievements included 79 scholarships for female law students that have led to the recruitment of the rst ve female prosecutors and the establishment of a dedicated unit for women and children by the Ofce of the Attorney General in Somaliland. 37. A new programme set up by DFID South Africa, in partnership with UNICEF, UNFPA and Save the Children Fund, is working to deliver an innovative new \u00a34 million programme that seeks to build the country's capacity on V AWG prevention. Preventing gender-based violence is a top priority for the UK in South Africa\u2014 where an estimated 42% of men have perpetrated violence against a partner. By working at three levels (national, province-wide, and community level), it aims to support government to address the root causes of GBV , and mobilise communities for prevention. DFID's support in particular focuses on the scale-up of existing programmes on V AWG, including child-friendly schools and clubs, and the involvement of a wide range of stakeholders to tackle V AWG. Acid violence programme 38. DFID supports global efforts to tackle the issue of acid violence against women and girls, both through the international NGO Acid Survivors Trust International (ASTI) and previously, through its local partners, including direct funding at country level to the Acid Survivors Foundations in Bangladesh and Pakistan. DFID is currently considering a proposal from ASTI for an Asia regional programme to tackle acid and burns violence, which would run from 2013 to 2015. 39. Acid violence is a brutal form of V AWG that involves intentional acts of violence where perpetrators spray, pour or throw acid on victims' faces and bodies. In some places (eg Nepal), these types of attacks involve thermal burns caused by kerosene instead. These attacks cause immediate disgurement, long-lasting medical complications, pain, social ostracism and psychological damage for victims. An estimated 90% of global burn injuries occur in developing countries and, although data on the problem remains limited, acid attacks appear to be more common in South Asia where there is cheap and easy availability of acid. It is thought that 80% of acid attack victims are female and almost 70% are under 18 years of age. 40. Through their work and that of their local partners, ASTI aim to strengthen the support services available to survivors of acid and burns violence, including medical, legal, rehabilitation and reintegration services; build the capacity of survivors to influence and contribute to tackling acid and burns violence; improve emergency responses and prevent further attacks; and strengthen the evidence base to tackle and prevent acid and burns violence. Trafcking programme 41. DFID's regional programming in Asia focuses on reducing particular forms of violence against women, such as trafcking. Through a \u00a33 million programme that will run over four years, DFID is working to prevent the incidence of trafcking among 60,000 women and adolescent girls who are garment and domestic work from Bangladesh, India and Nepal. The programme focuses on empowering women to reduce the risk of trafcking, and building political will and legal and institutional capacity building through cross-border collaboration.International Development Committee: Evidence Ev 93 Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C) programme 42. DFID is developing a new major regional programme to address the issue of FGM/C, which will build on the increasing international momentum to end the practice. Our vision is to see an end to FGM/C in one generation. By demonstrating leadership on this issue, we are also aiming to galvanise others to show their commitment and put nancial resources into ending the practice. 43. The new DFID programme (expected to be approved early in 2013) is likely to focus on high prevalence countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and Middle East and North Africa, and support community-level social change programmes, policy engagement, social change communication, and research and evaluation. It is also likely to include measures to support diaspora-led efforts to end the practice. DFID is also developing a new programme in Sudan to support efforts to end the practice, again working at different levels to effect social change. At the same time, DFID ofces in Somalia and Ethiopia are exploring what more they can do to support efforts to end the practice through their programming. 44. DFID has to date primarily supported measures to eliminate FGM/C through its core funding to the key UN agencies that address FGM/C, namely the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the World Health Organisation (WHO). We also provide support through our Partnership Programme Agreements to NGOs who are working on this issue, such as Plan UK and World Vision. New programmes from CHASE for 2013 (i) New DFID investment to build the evidence base on what works to tackle and prevent Violence Against Women and Girls (up to \u00a325 million over 2013-18) 45. To mark 25 November International Day for Eliminating Violence Against Women and Girls, the Secretary of State announced, at an event in Parliament on 28 November 2012, that DFID would invest up to \u00a325 million over ve years in a new Violence Against Women and Girls Research and Innovation Fund. 46. The Fund will consist of three distinct but inter-related components that address critical international evidence gaps: (a) Primary prevention of V AWG (in stable and fragile contexts); (b) V AWG in conflict and humanitarian emergencies; and (c) Economic and social costs of V AWG. 47. This pioneering Fund will drive innovation, build the global evidence base and support new programmes to tackle violence against women and girls. The funding will support operational research and impact evaluations, including programmes in conflict and humanitarian emergencies and innovation grants for new programmes that have potential to be taken to scale. 48. Through testing out new approaches and rigorous evaluation of existing programmes, we can better understand what works in tackling the root causes of V AWG in some of the poorest countries of the world. 49. Overall all, the Fund will deliver: \u2014 High quality and policy relevant evidence on what works to prevent V AWG; \u2014 Innovation programmes to prevent V AWG in developing countries\u2014implemented and evaluated; \u2014 Rigorous research and evidence on drivers, prevalence, protection and response for V AWG in conflict and humanitarian emergencies; \u2014 Policy relevant research and evidence and methodological advances on the economic and social costs of V AWG in developing countries; \u2014 Effective dissemination of ndings and engagement with key stakeholders to promote use of evidence. 50. This will enable improved development of and investment in V AWG policies and programmes around the world (including by UK Government, development partners and national governments) contributing to a long-term reduction in the prevalence of V AWG and an increase in the number of women and girls receiving quality prevention and response services. 51. The Fund will improve the UK Government's work on addressing V AWG in four ways: rst, by improving the quality of DFID operations; second, by supporting the UK's \"Call to End Violence Against Women and Girls\" strategy; third, meeting the UK's commitments under its National Action Plan on UN Security Council Resolution 1325 (Women, Peace and Security); and fourth, implementing the UK's Building Stability Overseas Strategy. The Fund will also support the Government's ambition to increase international efforts to tackle V AWG through the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative and the successor framework to the MDGs. 52. Subject to approval by DFID's Quality Assurance Group (currently underway), the Fund will be tendered and DFID expect to have it established by summer 2013.Ev 94 International Development Committee: Evidence (ii) Scaling up Support for Country Programmes on Violence against Women and Girls (up to \u00a31.85 million over 2013-16) 53. This intervention will get underway in the rst quarter of 2013 and is part of a broader effort to scale up DFID's work on violence against women and girls in at least 15 countries, as well as provide access to justice for 10 million women by 2015. It complements the related Research and Innovation fund which seeks to establish effective approach to preventing violence against women and girls. 54. The planned outputs of the programme that UK support will deliver or contribute to are as follows: \u2014 Call down contract for roster of experts to give \"hands on\" help on violence against women and girls programming in-country available to and utilised by UK staff; \u2014 Helpdesk on violence against women and girls programming for UK staff established and operational in UK; \u2014 12 guidance notes (4 planned per year) on best practice in violence against women and girls programming produced and disseminated; \u2014 Violence against women and girls Community of Practice to improve information sharing and best practice across HMG on V AWG issues; \u2014 Dedicated resource for evaluation of DFID's violence against women and girls programming to capture impact and learn lessons on \"what works\" in preventing violence against women and girls. This contributes to DFID's commitment to ensure the effectiveness of our funding and interventions. Measuring the effectiveness of DFID funding for VAWG 55. DFID has made rm policy commitments to build its programmes on solid evidence so that investments can be most effective in reducing rates of violence against women and girls. 56. DFID's Violence against Women and Girls Theory of Change indicates that holistic approaches to violence against women and girls that cover the four interventions: empower women and girls, change social norms build political will and legal and institutional capacity to prevent and respond and provide comprehensive services. 57. By mapping existing interventions in a given community DFID country ofces can look to ll critical gaps, complement what is already happening, and increase the impact of its interventions. 58. DFID's V AWG programmes have in-built evaluation components to ensure the effectiveness of our funding and interventions. As noted above, we are in the process of setting up a dedicated resource to strengthen our expertise and methodology for evaluating V AWG programmes. This will also feed in to a DFID's broader work to evaluate the Strategic Vision for Girls and Women, and build on ndings from the new V AWG Research and Innovation Fund, also noted above. 59. DFID will employ a strong policy and international engagement strategy to ensure dissemination and take up of our ndings. Programmes will prioritise the communication of ndings and innovation results to policy makers and practitioners at local, national and international levels. The extent to which DFID' s humanitarian responses address VAWG 60. The UK government's humanitarian policy makes a commitment to preventing and responding to V AWG in emergencies. DFID is working with NGOs and UN partners to improve the provision of comprehensive services for survivors of sexual violence in all stages of humanitarian response, including the onset of emergencies. In line with international standards, our partners are expected to mainstream protection for women and girls into their programming, and we have incorporated this into our humanitarian funding guidelines. 61. Recent examples of DFID humanitarian interventions that have a specic focus on support for survivors of sexual violence include the response to population displacement caused by conflict in the DRC and Syria, and to Typhoon Bopha in the Philippines. 62. We are building evidence on what works in humanitarian contexts through the research and innovation fund, and through innovative pilots with the Girl Hub. We will also consult with UN and NGO partners in 2013 to see how we can work together on this important issue. 63. We are currently carrying out a desk study into the use of the IASC Gender Marker, and assessing its relevance for measuring the mainstreaming of gender (including V AWG) into humanitarian response. Girl Hub (DFID partnership with the Nike Foundation) 64. We are currently undertaking a scoping study for a pilot with the Girl Hub and ve DFID ofces in countries affected by humanitarian emergencies and on-going conflict. This programme will pilot a range of activities that seek to build girls' \"protective assets\", so that they are less vulnerable to violence in times of emergency.International Development Committee: Evidence Ev 95 Multilaterals UN Women 65. DFID engage with multilateral partners in preventing V AWG, with the most notable intervention being through the UN Women Women, Peace and Security Programme. 66.UN Women \u2014The UK's core contribution is currently \u00a310 million per annum, which in 2012 meant the UK was the single largest core contributor. UK funding from 2013 will depend on the Multilateral Aid Review update. 67. DFID also funds the UN Women Peace and Security Programme, contributing GBP 3,250,000 The purpose of this programme is to ensure that women are able to contribute to and benet from security measures, and peace-building and peace-making processes at the community, national, regional and global levels. The programme runs from 15 March 2010 to 15 March 2013. Thus far, DFID has provided GBP 2,135,000, which has been divided between UN Women projects in Haiti, Liberia, Timor-Leste and Uganda, as well as providing critical support to activities at the global level. 68. The programme is a strategic response to the opportunities presented by the body of Security Council Resolutions (SCR) on Women, Peace and Security, namely 1325 (2000), 1820 (2008), 1889 (2009) and 1960 (2010). In the lead up to the tenth anniversary of 1325, it was widely acknowledged that implementation of the resolutions was inadequate in many respects. The programme targets actions and results in three areas: women's engagement in decision-making on peace-building, reform of the security sector to take account of women's role and needs, and accountability for SCR 1325/1820. Other multilaterals 69. DFID provides core funding to multilateral agencies whose work includes components that target violence against women and girls. In some cases this is implicit, as in the case of the International Federation of the Red Cross, which has recently increased its emphasis on preventing and addressing gender-based violence. Other agreements are explicit in their targeting of this issue. For example, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees has committed to comprehensive gender-based violence programmes in 24 situations by 2014.

If yes, what kind of stafng is needed\u2014eg technical specialists, senior staff? Will more staff be recruited to work on VAWG in country ofces? 1. The V AWG team currently consists of 1 A2 generalist; one part time A2 governance adviser (3 days), one part time A2 social development adviser (2 days), one full time B1 programme manager, one part time A2 generalist (2.5 days), one graduate placement (until end-August 2013) and oversight from the A1 group head. In addition, the team draws down time from an A2L social development adviser in the humanitarian response team (50%). The team also has an A1 social development adviser seconded to the FCO for one year to support the Foreign Secretary's Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict Initiative. 2. We are currently reviewing the team structure to reflect new priorities. This will not result in an increase in overall full time equivalent (FTE), but is likely to lead to a slight reconguration of grades and technical skills. 3. In addition, the Governance Conflict and Social Development team within the Research and Evidence Division has staff working on V AWG programming, including 40% of an A2 Social Development Adviser and 15% of an A1 Social Development adviser, as well as 20% of a B1 programme manager. 4. The majority of programmes and wider strategies that tackle V AWG across DFID's country ofces are led by Social Development Advisers, with Governance Advisers and generalists also playing important roles. 5. Social Development Advisers work across all of DFID's portfolio to maximise the impact of our investments on the lives of women, men, girls and boys living in poverty, ensuring interventions are appropriate given the social, cultural and political context and the realities of people's lives and choices. They lead the design and delivery of programmes that change behaviours and social norms, enhance empowerment andInternational Development Committee: Evidence Ev 97 strengthen accountability, and tackle extreme poverty, exclusion and inequalities. They are therefore central to ensuring DFID retains its global excellence in gender equality and delivers the Vision for Girls and Women. V AWG is an increasingly important focus of the work of the cadre. New Social Development advisers are explicitly tested for skills in Violence Against Women programming at their Assessment Centre. Opportunities for both continued professional development and lesson learning across Country Ofces include ways to improve skills and work on V AWG. 6. With more than 80 advisers, Social Development is the third largest technical cadre in DFID. Since May 2011, 21 new Social Development posts have been created and lled across DFID. Country Ofces and Regional Divisions are responsible for regular updates in workforce planning, working closely with the Heads of Profession to ensure we have the right balance and level of technical capacity to deliver priority programmes as these are identied, developed and delivered. There are no current plans for further expansion but the possibility for one or two new posts remains, as programmes evolve. 2.At present the VAWG team is located in CHASE, which covers security, justice and humanitarian policy for DFID Is there a dedicated staff member in the gender team that works on VAWG? How does the VAWG team currently ensure that the VAWG work is connected with DFID' s wider work on gender equality and the enabling environment (social norm change, empowerment of women and girls etc)? 7. The lead on V AWG in DFID rests with the V AWG team in CHASE. Various members of the gender team have supported this work in different ways as needs dictate. For example, the Gender Team Leader, Deputy Team Leader and Gender Policy Adviser have provided key support on the Commission on the Status of Women 2013, including inputs to brieng and technical support on UN language and negotiations. The Gender Policy Adviser was located with the V AWG team for one week during CSW itself. Social Development Advisers in the gender team have provided technical support on V AWG, for example, on V AWG and post 2015, and on the V AWG theory of change development. 8. The V AWG team work very closely with the gender team to ensure synergies are maximised. The V AWG team sits on the Senior Girls and Women Strategy Group (GWSG) that is chaired at Director-General level. It maintains the strategic overview of DFID's work to support girls and women. 9. Currently the V AWG and Gender Teams are working together on shaping the delivery of a women's rights strategy and a proposed advisory group with inputs from the social development advisory network. 3.DFID' s evidence highlights that there are Girls and Women' s \"Pillar leads\" for each pillar of the Strategic Vision on Girls and Women? Who is currently the pillar lead for pillar 4 \"prevent violence against girls and women\"? 10. The pillar lead for pillar 4 is the violence against women and girls team leader, Arvind Mungur. DFID's Theory of Change on VAWG 3.The DFID Theory of Change (TOC) and programming guidance on VAWG emphasise the importance of work on prevention of VAWG, especially work to change social norms and unequal gender relations. What programmes does DFID currently have in this area? Are there plans to increase programming? Can DFID give examples? Current Programming 11. DFID currently undertakes a variety of bilateral work to change social norms in: \u2014 Ethiopia (Child marriage programme). \u2014 Ghana (Girl PASS). \u2014 India (within Bihar health sector reform programme; Madhya Pradesh Urban Services for the Poor programme). \u2014 Jamaica (Citizen Security and Justice Programme). \u2014 Nepal (Our Goal: Stop V AWG programme and Empowering Youth to Comabt GBV in their Communities programme). \u2014 Nigeria's (V oices for Change Programme). \u2014 Pakistan (\"Aavaz\" (V oice) Programme on tackling violence against women). \u2014 South Africa (A Safer South Africa for Women and Children). \u2014 Uganda ( UN Joint programme on Gender and Equality and Support to Civil Society Organisations working on Gender Based Violence). \u2014 Zambia (Stop GBV). \u2014 Zimbabwe (Sexual and reproductive health and HIV programme). \u2014 DFID's Southern Africa regional programme (Making Every V oice Count for Gender Equality).Ev 98 International Development Committee: Evidence 12. These programmes use a variety of techniques to change individual attitudes and behaviours and to shift social norms including community conversations, working with men and boys, radio and other media campaigns, campaigning led by women's rights organisations, theatre campaigns and awareness raising on the impact of V AWG. Scaling up work on social norm change 13. When DFID's V AWG programmes were mapped against the interventions outlined in our V AWG theory of change in October 2012 (see Figure 1),60we identied the potential and need to both scale up our work on social norm change and to develop more multi-sectoral interventions. Figure 1 50 45 40 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 Empowerment Social norms Institutional capacity/willServices7 27 1646 21 Since this time: \u2014 New guidance has been disseminated on community-level programming (a key component of social norm change work); \u2014 A new up to \u00a325 million V AWG Research and Innovation Fund has been approved that will look more closely at \"what works\" including in changing social norms around V AWG; \u2014 A new up to \u00a330 million programme to tackle Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C) has been approved and had a large focus on social norm change, including direct efforts to work with communities to end the practice; supporting efforts to ensure legislation and policy is in place and appropriately implemented; building support for change at the community and national and global level through social change communication. \u2014 A new V AWG Helpdesk is being put in place within CHASE to build the capacity of DFID staff on V AWG programming, including ensuring advice and support is available in social norm change and awareness raising work. \u2014 New V AWG programmes are currently being developed in Afghanistan, Nepal, OPTs and DRC, within these social norm change work will be pursued as part of a multi-disciplinary approach to tackling V AWG. 14. DFID has also been working at an international level to raise awareness of the detrimental impact of V AWG and the necessity to act to tackle the issue. DFID has had high prole engagement, including through the Secretary of State and Parliamentary Under Secretary, in promoting and ensuring strong agreed conclusions on V AWG at the 2013 Commission for the Status of Women (CSW), the Foreign Secretary's Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative (PSVI), in initial negotiations on the importance of including V AWG in the post-MDG framework and in ensuring V AWG features prominently in the PM debates around the Rule of Law. 60This table outlines DFID's 115 interventions\u2014one large programme (bilateral programmes as well as civil society interventions and regional programmes) may have many interventions. Whilst some country programmes focus on one intervention theme only, eg, Political empowerment is the focus of Pakistan Aawaz Strengthening V oice and Accountability Programme, S&J reform is the focus of the Somalia UNDP Access to Justice Project, other DFID's programmes work across sectors and have a number of different interventions relating to ToC themes, Eg A Safer South Africa\u2014aims to involve teachers, learners, parents and communities in communication and social mobilisation around V AWG and support community-based awareness raising and community empowerment; strengthen national coordination, capacity and leadership on V AWG; scale up services such as child- friendly schools and clubs. Girls PASS in Ghana working across interventions to include Education; Schools institutional capacity building; Safe spaces, guidance & counselling.International Development Committee: Evidence Ev 99 DRC Example of New Programme 15. DFID DRC's Action Plan for Adolescent Girls states will make a signicant improvement in the lives of adolescent girls in DRC by: \u2014 Improving key development outcomes for adolescent girls, including reducing early pregnancy and levels of violence against girls, increasing access to secondary schooling, and improving access to economic assets. \u2014 Empowering adolescent girls to make informed choices and to control the decisions that affect them; \u2014 Addressing the structural barriers and social norms that constrain the opportunities available to adolescent girls. 16. As part of the Action Plan DFID is designing a new programme for adolescent girls. The programme will empower women and girls economically, politically and socially; give them increased agency61and voice, and reduce vulnerability to sexual and gender based violence. 4.DFID' s TOC and guidance on VAWG recognise the importance of delivering comprehensive services (health, psychosocial, education, legal services, shelter, economic support) to support VAWG survivors and those at risk. Equally, it stresses the need to address VAWG through other sectoral work\u2014for example through education, health and WASH programming. What are DFID' s plans for ensuring DFID' s sectoral programmes (e.g education, health, WASH) maximise opportunities to prevent and respond to VAWG? Sectoral interventions in humanitarian emergencies 17. DFID has recently committed to ensuring that assessment of risk of V AWG informs all our humanitarian responses. This will mean a more active follow-up to ensure that sectoral interventions in humanitarian emergencies (including for example WASH, health, distribution of non-food items, cash, shelter) at the very least do not exacerbate risks of V AWG. Unless there are compelling reasons why this should not be done, DFID will ensure that V AWG programming is integrated into sectoral responses and, where appropriate, will consider funding programmes that are specically aimed at preventing violence and providing comprehensive services to survivors. DFID will host a high-level event in the autumn, bringing UN and humanitarian agency principals and donor heads together to make further commitments to preventing and responding to V AWG. Country programme examples 18. In Pakistan under the Conflict Reduction and Humanitarian portfolio, the Resilience programme (under development) is specically highlighting the need to address gender issues in Community Based Disaster Risk Management. Design work is underway. With the Bridges component, sidewalks were added to the bridge design to encourage pedestrian usage: currently 10% of pedestrians are women. The new Conflict Reduction programme will include training, capacity building and public awareness interventions to improve Khyber Paktunwha Police standards of receiving and processing gender-based crimes. It aims to double the number of women in the police force to 280, and ensure that anti-harassment policies are integrated into the police as well as promoted in the community. Specialised investigation units that support district police to process specic sexual and gender-based crimes will be piloted and a grant fund established to nance activities that promote gender responsive policing or aim to counter SGBV . 19. DFID Kenya is mainstreaming V AWG within its new Adolescent Girls Initiative, an action research programme targeting 10,000 girls aged 10-14. The programme will provide direct interventions in health, education, prevention of violence and wealth creation. WASH Sector Current programming 20. A key aim of programmes delivering against the target of reaching 60 million people with WASH will be to address lack of progress on water and sanitation within marginalised and vulnerable groups, despite overall progress on MDG targets. In designing and evaluating these programmes, DFID will assess equity measures both with respect to the impacts on time taken for women and girls to collect water and use sanitation facilities and risks of violence against girls and women in relation to WASH. 21. DFID also prioritises women and girls in our existing water and sanitation programmes, for instance by using women's membership of local water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) committees to ensure that their needs for safe facilities are met and their voices in local decision-making are strengthened. Bangladesh Sanitation, Hygiene Education and Water Supply Programme 22. Examples of DFID WASH programmes demonstrate consideration of issues affecting women and girls. For example, one of DFID's largest WASH programmes, the Bangladesh Sanitation, Hygiene Education and Water Supply Programme recognises that women and girls are affected disproportionally by lack of clean water 61Agency includes women's ability to own and use assets, move freely, make decision and influence policy (see World Bank, World Development Report, 2012).Ev 100 International Development Committee: Evidence and basic sanitation. The programme aims to address this through ensuring accessible, affordable, reliable and good quality water, sanitation and hygiene. The programme makes linkages with other sectors including education and health, providing separate hygienic toilets for female students and teachers in secondary schools. Global WASH sector 23. DFID has provided on-going support to two key elements of routine reporting in the global WASH sector: the WHO:UNICEF Joint Monitoring Program (JMP) which collects data on progress in coverage of water and sanitation and the Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking Water (GLAAS) report that focusses on trends in nancing, policy, capacity and programming in the sector. With DFID's support, this programme will continue to monitor and report on essential elements of ensuring safe access to water and sanitation for women and girls including recognition of the right to water and sanitation, ensuring that resources are utilised fairly without discrimination and participatory processes to ensure that women and girls have access to safe and accessible services that they will use. New research programme 24. The DFID WASH portfolio review (2012) highlighted gaps in evidence on the relative impact of WASH investments on women and girls, non-health impacts associated with poor WASH and the risk of violence against women and girls associated with poor sanitation. DFID is supporting generation of critical knowledge for improved policy and practice on these issues through the Sanitation and Hygiene Applied Research for Equity (SHARE) research programme. An example of SHARE research to date includes: \u2014 A study in Kampala, Uganda, indicating that women feel particularly vulnerable in and around public toilets or defecating out in the open. In particular, women reported feeling that inadequate sanitation facilities threatened their safety by exposing them to the risk of rape and attack when travelling to communal latrines after dark62. Programme Partnership Agreement 25. DFID's main Programme Partnership Agreement in the WASH sector is with WaterAid. A core part of WaterAid's work is empowering women to have a voice within their communities, recognising a link between a lack of access to water and sanitation facilities and violence against women and girls. Future outputs 26. These are likely to include (but are not limited to): \u2014 Practical guidance, examples, materials, or tools on reducing V AWG through improved WASH programming\u2014such as through processes, engagement with women and girls, designs and appropriate locations of facilities. \u2014 Consideration of how men and boys should be involved in reducing risks of violence, either as the perpetrators or the victims of violence, or as professionals or community leaders with a key role in advocacy and enforcement working to reduce risks for women, girls and boys. \u2014 Good practice on how to ensure that WASH related staff and partners are knowledgeable on how to minimise risks related to V AWG. Education Sector Current programming 27. Over the last year the UK government has supported over 2.5 million girls in primary school, and 260,000 girls in lower secondary school; over 70% of DFID country education programmes have specic initiatives agreed or in the pipeline to support girls beyond primary level into secondary school. Girls Education Challenge 28. In September 2011 the \u00a3355mn Girls' Education Challenge (GEC) was announced. The programme was launched on May 1st 2012 calling on NGOs, charities and the private sector to nd better ways of getting girls in school. By 2016, 670,000 of the world's poorest girls will be in primary and secondary school and learning at both girls at primary and secondary level in nine focus countries. 29. Many of the programmes we will support through the Girls' Education Challenge will be looking at ways to ensure that schools are safe places to learn for both boys and girls. One of these will be run by Plan in Sierra Leone which will use teacher training and scorecards to help prevent violence. It will work with both girls and boys\u2014which is critical to success. Other examples include: \u2014 Providing girls that have experienced trauma with psycho-social counselling by social workers. \u2014 Setting up letter boxes in schools to report incidences of violence at school. 62SHARE (2012). Insecurity and shame, Kampala, Uganda. Brieng note. at: http://www.shareresearch.org/ LocalResources/V AW_Uganda.pdfInternational Development Ev 101 \u2014 Using children's clubs and parents' advocacy club to change attitudes towards violence against girls. \u2014 Engagement of counsellors to help female learners deal with various issues including trauma and harassment. \u2014 Construction of girl-friendly latrines to reduce harassment of girls. \u2014 Supporting communities to change attitudes and behaviours towards violence against girls. 5.What is DFID' s current strategy in terms of working with men and boys to prevent and respond to VAWG? 30. Evidence is clear that the root causes of V AWG are gender inequality and related social norms that perpetuate unequal gender power relations. In simple terms, social norms can be dened as a pattern of behaviour that individuals prefer to conform to on condition that they believe either most people in their relevant network conform to it and/or that most people in their relevant network believe that they ought to conform to it. For example, evidence shows that incidents of rape are more common in settings where social norms condone or ignore men's sexually coercive or aggressive behaviours. 31. Preventing V AWG therefore requires going beyond awareness raising or social marketing campaigns; it requires action to identify and transform the discriminatory and violence-supportive social norms that lie at the root of V AWG. Despite its complexity, there is promising evidence on the effectiveness of certain approaches to shifting social norms related to V AWG. In particular, evidence on working with men and boys through community workshops and education projects suggests that it is possible for interventions to be effective at shifting attitudes, and in some cases also shifting behaviours, in the short-term. These approaches are explored further in DFID's Guidance Note \"A Practical Guide on Community Programming on Violence against Women and Girls\"(please see attached). 32. DFID believes that giving men and boys the information, skills and space to better understand how gender shapes their own lives and relationships, ie through a participatory curriculum that engages men and boys over a prolonged period of time\u2014is most effective. As outlined in DFID's Guidance Note 2 on Community level programming (see page 18), there are also challenges and risks associated with programming with men and boys that must be considered, including losing sight of women and girls' needs, the loss of women-only spaces and men taking charge by assuming leadership positions within mixed groups. Current Funding for VAWG 6.DFID' s recent Theory of Change and programming guidance on VAWG highlight the importance of supporting women' s organisations and women' s human rights defenders in their work to address VAWG at national and community levels. However, such support is often best delivered as small grants rather than large-scale programmes. What funding channels are currently available for women' s organisations and groups at HQ and country level and does DFID have any plans to increase the level and flexibility of funding to women' s organisations for VAWG work? Current funding 33. DFID currently comprehensively funds smaller women's organisations centrally through a variety of mechanisms: \u2014 DFID CHASE supports over 25 smaller women's organisations through our UN Women Programme on Women, peace and security and through our Support to Acid Burns Survivors programme. \u2014 Programme Partnership Agreement grants provided to INGOs working on V AWG (eg Plan UK, Womankind Worldwide, Oxfam, IPPF, Action Aid and Article 19) provide support to their smaller partner organisations, including women's organisations and women human rights defenders in- country. \u2014 The Global Poverty Action Fund, DFID's central mechanisms for funding civil society, has a funding stream specically for small civil society organisations called the Community Partnership window. Within this, we have also agreed extra support for small organisations including more workshops and better guidance on how to ll in application forms; detailed individual feedback for all applicants; and a new interview stage for applicants who might have a good idea but nd it challenging to express it on paper. 34. Within DFID country ofces, there are also a variety of small grant mechanisms that support women's organisations in-country including those in Afghanistan (Tawamandi), Bangladesh (Manusher Josho Foundation), Nepal (Social Inclusion Action Programme), Pakistan (Gender Justice and Protection Programme), Uganda (UN Joint Programme on Gender), and Zimbabwe (National Child Sensitive Social Protection Programme). Example of Future Funding: Research and Innovation Fund 35. The V AWG Research and Innovation Fund is also likely to make funds available to smaller women's organisations who have traditionally struggled for funding (particularly on developing their monitoring & evaluation systems), through the disbursement of grants for innovative programmes. Enabling theseEv 102 International Development Committee: Evidence organisations to better monitor, evaluate and communicate their impact will be a key part of building their capacity to better access funds from other sources in the future. 7.To what extent is DFID current able to track expenditure on VAWG through its country programmes\u2014 whether in development, conflict-affected or humanitarian contexts? Does it use or have plans to use the OECD gender marker? What about disaggregation by age so it can look at the relative funding to women and girls? 36. Whilst DFID does track expenditure on V AWG within stand-alone V AWG programmes, it is more challenging to do this within broader development programmes where V AWG programming may be a smaller component. We are, however, putting in place a new monitoring and evaluation (M&E) resource that will come online in 2013 and will enable DFID to better assess its expenditure and impact within its bilateral V AWG programmes. 37. In countries where the bulk of humanitarian support is provided through pooled funds, tracking spend on specic thematic areas can be difcult. CHASE is initiating work with a selection of country ofces in 2013 to generate greater understanding of how DFID funds are used to support V AWG programming, with a view to increasing engagement and learning with implementing partners. 38. Humanitarian funding mechanisms like the Rapid Response Facility do require partners to disaggregate based on age and gender; we are looking more closely at how partners use such data to inform their programming. 8.Does DFID have any further plans for joint programming on VAWG, for example with UN Women or other UN agencies that have strong technical experience and ground-level experience? 39. DFID currently works with government ministries, UN agencies, and a wide range of international and local civil society organisations to deliver its V AWG programmes. These organisations can be divided into broadly three sets\u2014funding partners, implementing partners, and capacity building partners. 40. Funding partners include other bilateral and multilateral donors\u2014such as USAID, the EU and UN agencies\u2014which jointly support particular programmes. DFID works in particularly close partnership with the UN, particularly UN Women, UNICEF and UNDP\u2014both in terms of co-funding programmes, and supporting UN implementation. DFID is also in close dialogue with technical experts from UN Women, WHO and other UN agencies working on V AWG. 41. Implementing partners are those which manage programmes on the ground, such as the British Council, UN agencies, and national and international civil society organisations (and large consultancy companies). 42. Through the humanitarian coordination mechanism; the GBV sub-cluster (known as the GBV Area of Responsibility ( AoR) )CHASE is increasing its engagement with UNICEF and UNFPA, the two agencies that lead work on GBV in emergencies. Discussions with the AoR helped inform DFID's choices in supporting emergency interventions following Typhoon Bopha in the Philippines. 43. DFID will be engaging with UNICEF, UNFPA, OCHA and UNHCR over the coming months in the run- up to the high-level event on V AWG in emergencies, that is to be convened by the Secretary of State. DFID will be seeking to ensure that these key UN agencies meet existing commitments on prevention and response to V AWG. 44. In addition to the UK's core contribution to UNWomen (currently \u00a310 million per annum), which is being reviewed through the current Multilateral Aid Review, and \u00a33.25 million funding of the UN Women Peace and Security Programme, DFID engages directly in a number of programmes on the ground with UN Women and other UN agencies, for example: \u2014 In South Asia and the Middle East, DFID is providing \u00a39.75 million with the ILO and UNODC to prevent forced labour and trafcking of 100,000 women and girls in domestic work and the garment sector. \u2014 In Occupied Palestinian Territories, DFID provides \u00a32.1 million (2011-14) to support a UN Women- implemented programme to establish an independent observatory to collect data on V AWG cases, improve service delivery through Family Support Units and improving conditions for women in prison, and run campaigns to change attitudes towards V AWG. DFID also funds the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), including their work to develop referral systems for victims of V AWG. \u2014 In Ethiopia, DFID provided \u00a33.8 million (2011-12) to fund a UN Joint Programme on Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment; this included support to establish a national response to GBV , including a hotline for victims. \u2014 Recent targeted research studies with UNWomen and UNFPA tracking V AWG in Nepal (2011-2012). \u2014 In Uganda, DFID is providing \u00a312.9m (2009-1014) to fund a UN Joint Programme on Gender Equality. This includes a component on gender based violence; setting up of protection centers which provide psychosocial, medical, legal support and accommodation for survivors of violence; and equipping regional hospitals with equipment to assist victims of sexual violence.International Development Committee: Evidence Ev 103 \u2014 DFID Ethiopia is exploring the option of funding UNICEF's programme on \"Expanding and strengthening effective child justice and security justice systems with equitable access to services by girls and boys in Somali Region\" as part of the Peace and Development Programme. The programme is expected to increase access to an accountable and efcient justice and security system for children and women in Somali Region and will provide 80,000 woman and girl survivors of violence with safe access to adequate and appropriate medical, psychosocial, security, shelter and economic services. 45. DFID, as part of the cross HMG lobbying effort for CSW, put a lot of effort into supporting and working with UN Women's senior hierarchy to ensure a successful outcome at CSW. The UK is now keen to ensure that a strong and credible successor to Michelle Bachelet is appointed. Research and innovation fund 9.What is the latest information on the Fund\u2014have funds started to be disbursed? What are the priority areas in which DFID is seeking research? 46. Following initial announcement by the Secretary of State on 28 November 2012, DFID's new \u00a325m V AWG Research and Innovation Fund has undergone an internal Quality Assurance Review to ensure programme design delivers maximum impact and value for money. A revised Business Case was approved by the Secretary of State on 22 February 2013. 47. The Fund is principally seeking to address three specic factors that limit international efforts to reduce the prevalence of V AWG and improve response services for survivors: (i) limited focus on interventions to prevent violence, and lack of rigorous evidence on the effectiveness of existing prevention programmes in developing countries; (ii) limited focus on interventions to address violence in conflict and humanitarian emergencies, and lack of rigorous evidence on the effectiveness of existing programmes; and (iii) limited investment by key international and national actors in V AWG policies and programmes. 48. In response, the Fund will consist of three distinct but inter-related components and an overall evaluation. Each of these components and the overall evaluation will be tendered separately. \u2014 Component 1: Prevention of V AWG (in stable and fragile contexts); \u2014 Component 2: V AWG in conflict and humanitarian emergencies; \u2014 Component 3: Economic and social costs of V AWG; and \u2014 Overall evaluation. 49. Component 1: Prevention of V AWG (up to \u00a317.8 million over ve years)\u2014this component will generate research and evidence from both large-scale complex programmes and smaller innovation pilots to identify what interventions are most effective for prevention of V AWG, in what contexts and why. This will include operational research and impact evaluation in at least 10 DFID priority countries, and the provision of 10-14 grants to fund innovative programmes. Specically, evidence will be generated to address the following research questions: \u2014 What are links between structural economic, political and social determinants and prevalence of violence, and how does addressing these factors help in prevention of V AWG? \u2014 What strategies and interventions are most successful for prevention of V AWG, including strategies that promote social change and engage men and boys? \u2014 Which interventions to strengthen women's and girls' agency and empowerment (eg economic empowerment through savings and cash transfers, micro-credit schemes, work with schools) produce results that protect them from violence? \u2014 How effective are specic response mechanisms (eg security and justice reform, development of safe spaces) to prevent V AWG? \u2014 What are the options for scaling up effective prevention programmes?/which interventions are best value for money? 50. Component 2: V AWG in conflict and humanitarian emergencies (up to \u00a35 million over ve years)\u2014this component will consist of a research programme in three to ve countries with a combination of basic and operational research to deliver rigorous evidence on the drivers, prevalence, trends over time, and effective prevention and response mechanisms in conflict and humanitarian emergencies. Specically, evidence will be generated to address the following research questions: \u2014 What are the most important drivers and causes of V AWG in conflict and emergency contexts? How do different factors, such as different forms of conflict and fragility, interact to influence risk? \u2014 What are the most common forms of V AWG in conflict and emergency contexts, and how do trends and prevalence rates change throughout the course of conflict or emergency crises and in post- conflict settings?Ev 104 International Development Committee: Evidence \u2014 What prevention and response mechanisms are most effective in reaching girls/women experiencing violence in conflict and emergency contexts? Do different types of fragility/conflict necessitate different responses? How can programmes adapt and respond to rapidly changing contexts? \u2014 To what extent and how do security and justice system reforms at national levels deter perpetrators or influence risk? What impact do these initiatives have on women's and girls' access to services? \u2014 In what ways does V AWG feed into and exacerbate conflict between communities? How does V AWG affect the various dimensions of state fragility/resilience? How can state-building and peace-building processes contribute to a reduction in/prevention of V AWG? 51. As this component is complementary to the Foreign Secretary's PSVI, it will be ofcially announced in conjunction with the G8 Foreign Ministers' meeting in London on 10 and 11 April. 52. Component 3: Economic and social costs of V AWG (up to \u00a31.5 million over three years)\u2014this component will consist of a research programme to generate knowledge and evidence on the economic and social costs of V AWG in developing countries. Providing evidence on the signicant economic and social costs of violence to national economies, communities, and families will help to persuade policy makers to increase investments in policies and programmes to reduce the prevalence of violence, and provide response and protection to women and girls survivors. Specically, this research will include: \u2014 Development of methodologies that can be used to measure economic and social costs of V AWG in developing country contexts \u2014 Known economic and social costs of V AWG at local and national levels in at least three developing countries \u2014 Evidence on the relative cost-effectiveness of prevention versus response at national levels in at least three developing countries \u2014 Advancements in methodologies and approaches to measure impact, cost-effectiveness and value for money of V AWG programme interventions in developing country contexts. 53. Overall evaluation (up to \u00a30.7 million over ve years)\u2014an evaluation of the fund as a whole will assess its impact on preventing and responding to V AWG. This is a highly innovative programme designed to ll a critical evidence gap in a complex programming area. This overall evaluation will also ensure that key lesson learning across the three main components of the fund are shared to improve year on year implementation. 54. The key recipients of new knowledge and evidence generated by the Fund will be decision-makers influencing strategic investment, policy and programming to prevent and respond to V AWG, at the national and international level. This will include partners developing global policy (eg WHO and UN Women), as well as bilateral agencies, national governments, civil society organisations, DFID country staff and advisers, the research community and media. 55. DFID is currently nalising separate procurement plans for Components 1 and 2 of the Fund, with a view to beginning the tender process by the end of April 2013. It is expected that the selection of successful bidders for each component will be approved by Autumn 2013. Thereafter, each Component will undergo a 6 month inception phase to develop detailed research frameworks and procedures to disburse innovation grants. 56. Components 3 and the overall evaluation will be separately tendered from July 2013, with a view to selecting successful bidders by end 2013. DFID is staggering the tender process to ensure that appropriate resources are available to effectively evaluate bids and deliver best value for money. April 2013 Supplementary written evidence submitted by the Department for International Development Examples of Good Male Champions Two examples of global leaders in the eld of violence against women and girls are: (i) Michael Kaufman , the co-founder of the White Ribbon Campaign, the largest effort in the world of men working to end violence against women; (ii) Gary Barker , Executive Director of Instituto Promundo, a Brazilian NGO that works locally and internationally to promote gender equity and reduce violence against women, children, and youth. At a national level, programmes and local partners identify male champions in the course of their work to change norms around gender inequality and violence against women. For example, a large DFID programme under development in Nigeria will include local, state and national level work with male gender champions who speak out against V AWG using innovative and more traditional communications and behaviour change approaches. DFID's new \u00a34 million programme in South Africa, focused on the prevention of violence against women and girls, includes work to engage men and boys and traditional leaders as a way of tackling the issue.International Development Committee: Evidence Ev 105 Overall, DFID recognises the importance of working with male champions to combat violence against women and girls, and it is an area where we are seeking to do more. 9 May 2013 Supplementary written evidence submitted by the Department for International Development Use of Advisory Panels in Programming Across DFID, formal advisory panels and informal networks are used to inform and shape our work to tackle violence against women and girls (V AWG) and gender inequality. These vary in form and purpose, but help ensure our support: \u2014 Understands and is sensitive to local socio-cultural and political contexts; \u2014 Learns from women, girls, men and boys and others who are actively driving change in their own communities; \u2014 Draws on the knowledge, expertise and influence of local and national technical specialists and builds local ownership (eg researchers, business leaders, community leaders, relevant government ofcials, progressive religious leaders). At a global level, we are in the process of setting up an Expert External Advisory Group on Gender for the Secretary of State. Membership is being nalised but should include members from Africa, Asia and Middle East, and experts in violence against women and girls, social norms and working with men and boys. Our new Violence against Women and Girls Research and Innovation Fund will also have an Independent Advisory Board. DFID country ofces use formal advisory groups to inform strategy and programme design, implementation and review for programmes on gender equality and violence against women and girls. Examples include: \u2014 The End Child Marriage Steering Committee in Ethiopia, which is comprised of government, local civil society organisations and others. It provides strategic direction for the Government of Ethiopia programme to delay marriage among girls, funded by DFID. \u2014 A steering group in Ghana, led by the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection and DFID, involving local civil society and others. The Group informs and oversees work on the Domestic Violence National Survey. \u2014 As well as involving girls throughout their work, Girl Hub Rwanda has an advisory panel, comprised of a range of Rwandan stakeholders, to inform and steer their innovative programming. \u2014 DFID Asia's new Regional Human Trafcking programme has an external advisory group that includes women survivors of trafcking, practitioners, donors and policy makers to provide advice and an external challenge role. The Global Alliance against Trafcking of Women, a women's network for trafcked women, will review materials and activities to ensure these meet the needs of migrant and trafcked women. \u2014 As well as expert research and advisory committees, DFID's Adolescent Girls' Initiative in Kenya will have a forum to involve adolescent girls in design and monitoring, and to ensure the programme is accountable to them. Regular discussions with local practitioners and policy makers also shape DFID's understanding of the local context, and the design and delivery of effective programmes. Staff in all ofces, particularly Social Development Advisers, meet with a diverse range of gender and V AWG related partners, including women in Parliament, business, the media, and community-based organisations, in different fora. DFID also holds regular policy discussions with Governments on women's and girls' empowerment, and V AWG as relevant. \u2014 In Pakistan, discussions on women's empowerment happen with Government at all levels. DFID uses the annual \"International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women\" as an advocacy platform, and we interact regularly with the Elimination of Violence Against Women Alliance, the largest network of organisations working on violence in Pakistan. \u2014 In the Middle East and North Africa, DFID maintains an informal network of women's organisations and champions, and links to Fora such as the Arab International Women's Forum. Finally, our business processes demand that (i) all business cases include social impact appraisal that covers the local context, opportunities and risks for women and girls and (ii) Annual Reviews include consultation with beneciaries. 9 May 2013Ev 106 International Development Committee: EvidenceSupplementary written evidence submitted by the Department for International Development DFID V AWG PROGRAMMES\u2014STATUS AND TIMESCALES ASCOT and West and Central Asia Funding Total Programme Country Programme Title Sector Status Timescale Partners Budget (\u00a3) Afganistan Tawanmandi Strengthening Civil Society Supporting Civil Live 2011-16 Governments of \u00a319,950,000 Programme Society Norway, Denmark, Sweden Afganistan Currently scoping new AWG V AWG standalone scoping underway tbc tbc tbc standalone programme Bangladesh Rights and Governance Challenge Fund Governance Live 2008-13 Government of \u00a38,000,000 (RGCF) Norway Bangladesh Police Reform Programme (PRP) Security and Justice Live 2009-14 UNDP \u00a310,000,000 (DFID contribution) Bangladesh People's Rights, Governance New programme 2013-18 AusAID, Comic \u00a349.5m and Transparency Programme Relief India Madhya Pradesh Urban Services for the Safety Live 2012-15 N/A \u00a33,000,000 Poor (II) (MSUSP II) India Sector Wide Approaches to Health Live 2008-16 Government of \u00a315,000,000 Strengthening Health (SWASTH) Bihar's Women's Programme Development Corporation (WDC) India Bihar health sector programme Health Live 2012-16 \u00a31,900,000 India Poorest Area s Civil Society (PACS) Accountability live Mar-13 Support to \u00a320,000 2009-2016 Breakthrough India International;
