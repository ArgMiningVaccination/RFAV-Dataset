Tangent Biden's sweeping new coronavirus and economic recovery plan also includes increasing the number of federal personnel deployed to hospitals to treat coronavirus patients, accelerating the distribution of monoclonal antibodies and coronavirus tests, doubling fines for violating the government's mass transit mask mandate, expanding loans and loan forgiveness to small businesses and pushing for vaccine mandates and regular testing in schools.
