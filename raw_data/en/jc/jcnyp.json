Welcome to the time of the new year's resolution . top of the list? Finally drop that 10-15 pounds and get back to the de - sired high school weight, or at least make an inroad into that recalci - trant body mass index (BMI) and associated health conditions such as hypertension, metabolic syndrome, or non-insulin-dependent diabetes. Weight loss is on a lot of people's minds,1 and is big busi - ness; people spend $40 billion yearly on weight loss programs and products. 2 Also, about one-third of people in the United States will make a weight loss pledge for the new year. In addition, it may be a common question posed to one's health care provider: \"I've tried everything. What else can I do?\" There are a plethora of diets and dietary supplements purport- ed to be the magic bullet, though arguably one of the most trendy approaches is that encompassing human chorionic gonadotropin, or HCG (alternatively, in the scientific literature, it is abbreviated hCG). The 250,000 visits to the Dr. Oz discussion of this diet on YouTube may further support the popularity or, at the very least, the interest in this weight loss approach. Dr. Oz interviewed patients and doctors who attested to how they were able to lose 1 pound daily, on average, and were \"never hungry\" despite eating only 500 calories daily. The U.S. government recently became involved in this topic by expressing its opinion through an FDA and FTC law - suit against some of the manufacturers of HCG products. 3 To bring together the popular hype and medical research, this review will capture some of the results of clinical trials, comment on possible mechanisms of action, and discuss overall efficacy and safety of the HCG hormone and diet. HCG Diet Components The use of HCG in weight loss is often cited as originating with Dr. Albert T.W. Simeons in the 1950s. 4 His protocol involved HCG EDITOR Russell H.

Since this initial use of HCG for weight loss, many variations on the proto - col have surfaced, including the use of HCG drops (usu - ally homeopathic) or a shorter treatment duration, for no less than 26 days (with 23 injections). Some companies support only pharmaceutical grade injections, while oth - ers criticize the unproven homeopathic drops favoring instead their particular formulation that includes a pro - prietary blend of amino acids. All have very convincing testimonials of success from health care practitioners and patients alike. As mentioned in the January issue of Alternative Medi- cine Alert, HCG Diet Direct, HCG Platinum, and Nutri Fusion Systems are three of the companies listed in the FDA/FTC lawsuit. 5 These and other products contain statements such as \"Appetite Control and Detox,\" and \"Weight Loss Formula,\" and may have homeopathic HCG (dosed from 6X-60X), with or without amino acids, herb - al medicines, and other nutraceutical ingredients. Despite the diversity of marketing and specific propri- etary blends, the weight loss claims are similar: less hun - ger; preferential weight loss (20-40 pounds over 40 days) from thighs, abdomen, and hips; and mental support for the emotional aspect of dieting. 4,6 One expert points out that the HCG component of these protocols may, in fact, be completely irrelevant, as most people on 500 calories daily would be expected to lose 1 pound daily with or without any supplemental nutrients or pharmaceuticals.7 Entire books and volumes of information on the Inter - net are dedicated to the specifics about the actual food part of the HCG protocol. Many current HCG diets are varia - tions of the original Simeons protocol: any food intake for the first 2 days of injections, then begin the 500 calorie per day diet involving weighed quantities of protein and specific amounts of fruits, vegetables, and carbohydrates, but no fat, in two meals daily. 8 Physiology of HCG HCG is a hormone with numerous functions in the pla - centa, uterus, and fetus during pregnancy, including the promotion of progesterone production from the corpus lu - teum via binding to a combined hCG/LH receptor.9 There are two subunits (alpha and beta) in each HCG molecule, and four independent HCG variants beta subunit is conserved in these four variants, which are produced in different parts of the body and have differ - ent physiological effects. 9 The common marketing claim that HCG \"helps the developing fetus to get the neces - sary nutrients\" seems to be the branch point from which a case is made for how the body mobilizes fat stores during the weight loss protocol. Most experts document, how - ever, that HCG helps with fetal growth and development by promoting adequate blood vessel development in the placenta and by signaling mechanisms and receptors in fetal organs; 9 there is no mention of a peripheral effect on maternal physiology that then leads to enhanced fetal nourishment. One popular HCG website ventures into another hy - pothesized mechanism of action by stating that \"The presence of HCG in the body signals the hypothalamus to release stored fats when low levels of calories are con - sumed.\" 10 It is true that HCG receptors have been found in the central nervous system, including the hypothalamus, a possible etiology for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy rather than appetite control as proposed by the aforemen - tioned website. 9 One clinical trial allows some extrapolation to the realm of the hypothesized effect of HCG on weight loss. This double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial shed some light into how HCG might be affecting muscle and fat. Addressing suspected hypothalamic-pituitary dys - function in older men, recombinant HCG was adminis - tered, with the hopes of helping with symptoms of tes - tosterone deficiency, including energy, libido, and mood changes. 11 Some of the thought for the use of HCG in this capacity comes from positive results for young men with gonadotropin deficiency or in idiopathic infertility, an FDA-approved indication for HCG therapy. In the above study, 250 mcg of HCG was self-administered subcutane - ously twice weekly in 20 men for 3 months (and then the Alternative Medicine Alert 15 group was followed for 1 additional month), and numer - ous parameters were followed, including lean body mass and fat mass. In the treatment group, lean body mass and body weight increased compared to the placebo group (approximately 6 pounds and 2 pounds, respectively), and calculated fat mass, primarily at the mid-thigh, decreased approximately 4 pounds, all at the 3-month time point. Adverse effects were statistically similar between the two groups, but three people in the HCG group developed nipple tenderness (though not gynecomastia). This would seem to indicate that HCG may cause a change in fat vs lean body mass at those dosages. Clinical Trials In the 1970s, there was a flurry of interest in the United States for the weight loss effects of HCG, followed by a few German articles in the 1980s, and then very little since. After mostly equivocal results, most recommenda - tions were that the HCG protocol was not effective for weight loss and should not be used. There has been one meta-analysis that encapsulates some of this scientific work. 12 The review examined 24 HCG weight loss studies published between 1966 and 1993, finding 14 randomized controlled trials, only one of which had conclusive data showing positive results (20-pound weight loss over 6 weeks for the HCG group, compared to 11 pounds for the placebo group). Subse - quently, an effort to exactly duplicate the methodology of the reported positive study failed to find any difference between placebo and HCG injections. 13 All remaining tri - als detailed in the meta-analysis failed to find any benefit in weight loss or other measured parameters for HCG in- jections over placebo. Some of these trials are discussed below. An example of one of the early clinical trials random - ized 40 obese women ages 20-40 years to receive intra - muscular HCG (no dose listed) or placebo 6 days week - ly for 6 weeks; weight, hunger, localized fat reduction, and mood were measured. 4 Both groups followed a very low-calorie (approximately 500 calories) diet. Seven of the women were excluded from the final analysis, but in- tention-to-treat analysis was not done, compromising the final results. Both groups demonstrated the same loss of weight, and similarities were found in all other param - eters measured. Another study randomized 202 people to either HCG injections (125 mcg daily for 6 days of the week) or saline placebo injections for 6 weeks, while all were closely fol - lowing the Simeons diet limited to 500 calories daily. 8 Af- ter this initial 6-week period, there was a 6-week \"weight maintenance\" phase, and then a 6-week crossover treat - ment period. Measurements were made for body weight and percentage body fat, neither of which was different between the two groups. For example, over 6 weeks, the average body weight loss was 6.8 kg for the HCG group and 7.0 kg for the placebo group. The dropout rates for the HCG and placebo groups were similar between the two (57 and 49, respectively); this is not an easy protocol to follow, presumably accounting for the high dropout rate. Another research group addressed the difficulties in following this diet by studying hospitalized (and therefore more closely watched and diet-controlled) obese women \u2014 six on the HCG injection protocol and five on a pla - cebo injection \u2014 for six weeks in a double-blind fashion (randomization not mentioned). 14 Both groups followed a 500 calorie per day diet. Numerous laboratory param - eters, skinfold thickness, and circumference in several body areas were measured in the two groups. Results for the two groups for all of these categories were statistically similar; the weight loss was approximately 9 kg. Of note, urinary ketones and serum uric acid increased for both groups during the treatment periods, the latter possibly a concern for people with a history of, or at risk for, gout. Sounding a bit like a broken record, a more recent study with a similar protocol except for a caloric intake just above 1000 calories daily (to address the blunted metabolic rate that can occur with severe calorie restric-tion) found no change in any of a myriad of laboratory and clinical measurements between placebo and HCG in - jections. 15 The above-mentioned clinical trials all examined the original Simeons protocol using HCG injections for weight loss. More recently, the shift in the public's use of HCG has been to oral administration of HCG, primarily in a homeopathic form. Unfortunately, the medical literature is frustratingly mute on this version of the HCG protocol. Dosing There are numerous over-the-counter products with a variety of HCG dosages and forms. It is possible to pur - chase oral drops, pellets, and sprays, some with propri - etary blends of other nutrients, such as amino acids. One product may dose the HCG at 10 drops three times daily, but its homeopathic strength of 6X would be difficult to compare to a 30X form mixed with several amino acids. Another propriety combination of HCG and amino ac - ids (910 nanograms in 10 drops) is dosed 10 drops three times daily. The medical literature does not provide guid - ance about the most efficacious dosing for these over-the-counter formulations. The use of pharmaceutical-grade injectable HCG first proposed by Simeons and studied by the vast majority of clinical trials is 125 mcg intramuscu - larly or subcutaneously once daily 6 days per week. The use of recombinant alpha HCG for ovulation induction or assisted reproductive technology, as a comparison, is 250 mcg subcutaneously once daily for just one dose. 16 February 2012 Adverse Effects When adverse effects were followed and detailed, and this was not always the case, most of the clinical trials re - viewed above found no significant adverse effect rate dif - ferences between the HCG treatment and placebo groups. Notable exceptions are the report of nipple tenderness11 and laboratory abnormalities (mentioned above), presum - ably due to the ketosis or rapid weight loss from severe calorie restriction. In addition, one review mentions ad - verse effects associated with HCG injections might in - clude blood clots, headaches, restlessness, depression, and dizziness, although the source of this information is not listed; it is possible that these events were extrapo - lated from the use of HCG to treat infertility, given that the on-line drug reference Micromedex mentions throm- boembolic disorders and ovarian hyperstimulation syn - drome as possible adverse effects. 6 Although not an ad- verse effect per se, the literature mentions one case of a women with infertility who, upon beginning injections of HCG for weight loss, became pregnant.15 There are, of course, dangers with rapid weight loss and severe calorie restriction, including the precipitation of gallstones and nutrient deficiencies. Conclusion Human chorionic gonadotrophin is a hormone most well-known for its supportive effect in pregnancy, with four different types of HCG having a wide range of ef - fects on the fetus, placenta, and uterus. Less obvious is its relevance to overall adult physiology, in general, and weight loss, in specific, although one small clinical tri - al using HCG for men with testosterone deficiency did show an increase in lean body mass and body weight (so much for weight loss!) and a loss of body fat mass, sup - porting the claims of some of the HCG marketing ma - chine. Most of the clinical trials were in the 1970s and 1980s, and followed the original Simeons method of 125 mcg intramuscular HCG administration combined with a 500-calorie diet. Minus one positive result that couldn't be corroborated, without exception, clinical trials failed to demonstrate a weight loss or physiological or psychologi - cal benefit to HCG over placebo. Adverse effects of HCG are rare, but may include the precipitation of gout, throm - boemolobic events, and hyperstimulation of ovaries. A completely different set of adverse effects are possible when considering the totality of the HCG protocol, which involves a severely low calorie diet. Recommendations A risk-benefit approach to the analysis of the HCG diet protocol would dictate to not recommend this weight loss method. HCG injections have been examined and found to not be of use beyond the weight loss that would be ex -pected with a 500-calorie a day diet. In addition, the use of HCG and such severe calorie restriction are not without risks. However, the homeopathic and liquid forms for sale and seemingly widely popular have not been subjected to any clinical trials, so it is difficult to say whether these forms would similarly be ineffective, even though the pro - posed HCG mechanism does not entirely make sense and would lead us to believe that even the oral HCG alter - native to the Simeons protocol would also fail to lead to convincing weight loss. Obesity is on the rise, and many people are desperate for a kick start to lose weight and achieve health; this is the primary reason mentioned for the short-term use of the HCG protocol. Rather than in - volving HCG, perhaps the ideal approach for our patients does focus on a healthy diet, with calorie restriction in the short term and sustainable long-term changes in eating habits and lifestyle. n References 1.

O'Math\u00fana, PhD Senior Lecturer in Ethics, Decision-Making & Evidence, School of Nursing & Human Sciences, Dublin City University, Ireland Dr. OMath\u00fana reports no financial relationships relevant to this field of study. Creatine remains one of the most popular supplements for athletes, especially to enhance power and speed. A large body of research evidence supports claims that creatine enhances power output during short maximal bursts of exercise, such as power lifting or sprinting. 1 The benefits are noted particularly when short exertions are repeated intermittently in what is called interval training. However, some benefits also have been found for endur - ance exercise. Although much of the focus on creatine has been on athletes, maintaining muscle mass and strength is also important for older adults. Aging is associated with loss of muscle mass and decreased strength, which can nega- tively impact activities of daily living and quality of life. 2 Such changes can increase the risk of falls, which can be a major problem with aging. Sarcopenia refers to a condition that occurs when fat- free mass is more than two standard deviations below normal. 3 Approximately 25% of those older than 70 years of age have sarcopenia, increasing to nearly half of those over 80 years.3 It has been estimated that a 10% reduc - tion in the prevalence of sarcopenia in the United States could save more than $1 billion per year. 4 Resistance training is effective at counteracting sarcopenia, as is tes - tosterone administration.2 However, concerns about the latter's adverse effects have led to interest in other, safer interventions, with creatine supplementation of major in - terest. Given the prevalence of sarcopenia, and an aging population, this article will review the available evidence on creatine supplementation to reduce age-related loss of muscle mass and strength. Background Creatine is synthesized in the body from the amino acids arginine, glycine, and methionine. Adults generally make 1-2 g of creatine daily, which is later broken down to creatinine and excreted at a rate of about 2 g per day. 2 To provide for additional needs, creatine can be obtained from the diet, especially from meat and seafood.3 After synthesis or ingestion, creatine is transported pri - marily to skeletal muscle where about 95% of the body's creatine is stored. About two-thirds of the creatine in skel - etal muscle exists as creatine phosphate (CP), with the remainder found as free creatine. 1 As muscles work, CP is used to replenish adenosine triphosphate (ATP) ( see Fig- ure). ATP is the muscle's biochemical energy molecule and is converted to ADP as its energy is used. Muscles normally store enough ATP for only a few seconds of ex - ertion, after which CP can provide fuel for an additional 4-6 seconds of intense exercise. This all depends on the muscle's free creatine concentration. Hence, it has been hypothesized that if supplementation increased the mus - cle's creatine levels, more energy would be available dur - ing exercise. Figure ATP ADP + PiContraction Creatine + PiCreatine Phosphate18 February 2012 Mechanism of Action Muscle mass and strength decrease by about 1-2% per year after age 50.3 The number of muscle fibers decreases, but especially type II (or fast-twitch) fibers, which are re - placed by intramuscular fat.4 Type II fibers are particu - larly high in creatine and CP content. Thus, normal aging and muscle loss reduces stored creatine levels, leaving less energy available for exercise. Creatine supplementation in older adults is thought to increase creatine and CP levels in muscles, allowing people to exercise longer and at higher intensities, thus stimulating growth in muscle mass and strength. Changes in these physiological parameters have been measured in several studies of both younger and older subjects after creatine supplementation. The results of a meta-analysis of such studies are presented in the Table showing how creatine supplementation impacts these biomarkers. 4 Clinical Studies Creatine was first identified in 1832 and its metabo - lism was studied extensively over the next century.2 Sub- sequently, interest faded until the British sprinter, Linford Cristie, revealed in 1992 that he had taken creatine during the preparations that led up to his Olympic gold medal. 2 Shortly afterwards, studies demonstrated that creatine supplements did increase muscle creatine levels and ex - ercise performance.5 Since then, several hundred studies have been published on the topic.2 Much of the interest in creatine for older adults is derived from extrapolations from the sports science research. The first double-blind study to examine creatine use with resistance training in elderly, sedentary adults was published in 1998. 6 Thirty-two men and women (67-80 years old) were randomized into four groups: creatine with resistance training, placebo with training, creatine without training, and placebo without training. None of the participants did weight-lifting before the study, and all were sedentary-to-moderately active. Creatine dose was 20 g/day for 5 days, followed by 3 g/day for a total of 8 weeks. Resistance training was carried out three times a week. No significant changes in body mass or body fat were found in any group. Training groups had significant - ly increased strength and endurance compared to those not training ( P < 0.02). Creatine supplementation did not provide any additional benefit. Three reviews have recently been published and identi - fied a total of 12 relevant trials. 2-4 All 12 studies were ran - domized, placebo-controlled, and double-blinded. They were similar in enrolling around 20-40 subjects older than age 65 years and either used a creatine protocol simi - lar to that described above or gave subjects 5 g/day for a number of months. The longest study, which lasted 1 year, reported no significant differences between its groups. 7 Out of the 12 studies, seven found significant beneficial effects on fat-free muscle mass and/or strength, and five found no beneficial effects on muscle mass or strength. The results of all these studies have not been combined into a meta-analysis. Most studies giving creatine supple - ments without exercise found beneficial effects on muscle mass and strength, but some found no benefits. About half the studies included resistance training programs, again with the majority showing significant benefits, but some not. All of the reviews concluded that creatine supple - mentation, particularly with resistance training, can have beneficial effects on muscle wasting in older men and women. However, the effects are not consistent, suggest - ing that other variables need to be considered. Since re - sistance training itself is known to have beneficial effects, most reviewers recommend combining creatine supple - ments with exercise. Some studies have examined the timing of creatine in - gestion and suggested that this may be more important than the actual dose of creatine. 8 Exercise stimulates mus- cle protein degradation and synthesis. Synthesis predomi - nates when protein or amino acids are ingested shortly before or after exercise, hence the current popularity of protein shakes being consumed by athletes immediately after workouts. Part of the reason for these effects is in - creased blood flow to muscles after exercise. This has been hypothesized as a way to more efficiently transport ingested creatine to muscles. A small number of studies have found that ingesting creatine immediately before and after exercise leads to greater gains in muscle mass than when creatine is ingested in the morning and eve - ning, away from training times. 3 Adverse Effects Creatine supplementation among athletes frequently leads to a 1-3 kg weight gain, probably due to intramus- cular water retention.9 Concerns often are raised about cramping when creatine is taken in conjunction with ex - ercise, although this has not been supported by studies.1 Anecdotal reports claim creatine supplementation can Table % i ncrease % i ncrease in s ubjects in s ubjects B iomarker 18-36 y ears 52-79 y ears Total creatine 2 1.7 1 4.9 CP 1 3.3 8 .2 Free creatine 3 9.3 2 8.6 ATP 4 .2 6 .8Alternative Medicine Alert 19 cause gastrointestinal problems, though these are not frequently reported in studies. One study with older men found significantly more reports of loose stools during creatine loading than with placebo, and during mainte - nance dosing, more muscle cramping and strains with creatine. 10 Occasional case reports report more serious adverse affects, in particular involving renal and hepat - ic function, but evidence to support these have not been found in studies.11 However, those with renal disease or at risk of renal dysfunction are usually recommended to avoid creatine supplementation or monitor renal function carefully if creatine is taken.1 Drug Interactions No drug interactions are known, although concerns about the potential for renal toxicity raise issues about drugs metabolized through the kidneys. Formulation Creatine is readily available from meat and fish (con - taining roughly 4-5 g/kg), and therefore, is classified as a dietary supplement, not a drug. As a supplement, it is most commonly available as a monohydrate in powder, candy, gum, and liquid. Many synthetic derivatives are available, more. Claims that any one of these is more effective than another have not been supported in the few independent assessments available. 1 Numerous products combine creatine with vitamins, nutrients, and other supplements, but clinical studies of these were not identified. Athletes usually \"load\" with 20-25 g creatine per day for 5-7 days (usually 5 g qid), followed by one 2 g daily dose. Studies with older people have used this regi - men, or they were given 2-5 g per day. Conclusion Numerous studies of creatine supplementation by athletes have demonstrated beneficial effects on muscle mass and strength after high-intensity exercise. Such re - search with older adults is less extensive. Most, but not all, studies support a beneficial effect on muscle mass and strength either with or without resistance exercise. It re - mains unclear whether muscle creatine storage decreases with age, or whether this is a function of reduced activity and dietary creatine intake. If it is the latter, this may ex - plain some of the variability obtained in the studies con - ducted to date. Recommendation Resistance training is beneficial in preventing or re - versing the loss of muscle mass and strength that occurs with aging. Creatine supplementation alone or in addition to exercise may enhance these effects. Adequate hydra - tion is important to avoid cramping problems. In addi - tion, preliminary results suggest that creatine may have other beneficial effects during aging, particularly a slow - ing of cognitive decline. 2 However, the equivocal nature of the results to date suggest either that only some people benefit from creatine supplementation, or that more needs to be understood about how creatine is administered. It appears that taking creatine immediately before or after exercise may be more important than how much is tak - en. While creatine supplements are safe, similar benefits may be obtained from dietary creatine, such as by eating a meal with red meat or seafood immediately before or after exercise. n References 1.

Greenfield, MD, Editor Synopsis: The prevalence of chronic heart failure has steadily increased with improvements in survival rates for cardiac patients; however, heart failure remains a disorder whose typically progressive course worsens quality of life, and thus far has defied most convention - al medical approaches. New ideas leading to new treat - ments are needed. The researchers behind this small intervention trial examined the effect of repeated sauna therapy on exercise tolerance in people with congestive heart failure \u2014 and found significant benefits. Source: Ohori T, et al. Effect of repeated sauna treatment on exercise tolerance and endothelial function in patients with chronic heart failure. Am J Cardiol 2012;109:100-104. The researchers behind this clinical intervention trial sought to assess the impact of Waon therapy (re - peated sauna therapy) on exercise tolerance in people with congestive heart failure (CHF). Subjects had to have sta - ble, compensated NYHA functional class II heart failure and/or previous hospitalization for worsening failure to be included in the trial; a total of 41 subjects entered into the protocol (mean age 68 years). Participants underwent Waon therapy with a far-infrared dry sauna (temperature maintained at 60\u00b0 C) daily on weekdays for 3 weeks (n = 15 sessions) while continuing to receive conventional medical care for CHF. Treatment consisted of the sub - jects initially sitting in the sauna for 15 minutes, followed by bed rest for 30 minutes while covered with a blanket to maintain warmth. Assessments completed before and after the 3 weeks of intervention included body weight, 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), cardiopulmonary exer - cise testing in those physically able to pump the pedals of an ergometer (n = 20), and symptom-limited cardio - pulmonary exercise testing using expired gas analysis. Vascular endothelial function was evaluated through de - termination of flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the bra - chial artery. Echocardiography was performed, as was measurement of neurohumoral factors and the number of circulating CD34+ cells. Subjects were weighed before and after the therapy and drank water to compensate for the weight loss. By the end of the 3-week study significant improve - ments with Waon therapy had been identified, includ - ing an increase in left ventricular ejection fraction from 30.4% to 32.5% ( P = 0.023), an improvement in peak ox -ygen uptake, slight improvement in left ventricular ejec - tion fraction, a reduction in plasma norepinephrine levels from 400 to 300 pg/mL (P = 0.015), a decrease in brain natriuretic peptide 550-416 from 3.5%-5.5% ( P < 0.001), and an increase in 6MWD from 337-379 m ( P < 0.001). There was also an increase in the number of circulating CD34+ cells (P = 0.025). A multivariate analysis revealed that change in FMD was the only independent determinant of change in 6MWD. Findings did not vary according to severity of heart failure or subject age. The authors concluded that repeated sauna therapy in people with chronic heart failure may improve exercise tolerance in association with improvement in endothelial function. n COMMENTARY The findings from this small study are startling, though perhaps they shouldn't be, as the researchers reference five prior studies suggesting that significant cardiovascu- lar benefits could be expected from repeated sauna ther - apy. Compelling, however, are the conclusions that three weeks of Waon therapy in people with CHF not only im - proves exercise tolerance and ejection fraction, but also curtails neurohumoral activation and enhances endotheli-al function; this in the setting of a disease whose progres - sion typically is deemed inexorable, in large part due to persistent deterioration in endothelial and cardiac func-tion associated with neurohumoral activation and cardiac remodeling. The theory currently holding sway regard - ing potential mechanistic actions of Waon therapy and its cardiovascular health benefits is that such treatment may increase nitric oxide bioavailability, thus creating a direct To reproduce any part of this newsletter for promotional purposes, please contact: Stephen Vance Phone: (800) 688-2421, ext. 5511 Email: stephen.vance@ahcmedia.com To obtain information and pricing on group discounts, multiple copies, site-licenses, or electronic distribution please reproduce any part of AHC newsletters for educational purposes, please contact: The Copyright Clearance Center for permissionPhone: (978) 750-8400 Email: info@copyright.comWebsite: www.copyright.comAlternative Medicine Alert 21 benefit to endothelial function, but not a direct impact on cardiac function. There is at least one other interesting finding noted by the study authors, that being the effect of Waon therapy on the number of circulating CD34+ cells. These cells are considered to be precursors of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), which since being identified in the late 1990s have been used alternately as biomarkers for cardiovas - cular disease or actual angiogenic therapies that might promote repair of damaged vascular endothelium. 1 This therapeutic approach is in its relative infancy, but interest in it has spawned a large number of research studies in recent years. It is important to keep in mind that the current study has major limitations, not the least of which are the small sample size, the brief duration of treatment, the lack of a control group, and the short follow-up period. None-theless, findings such as these have the potential to leave us with a sense of wonder in the face of complex issues such as heart failure \u2014 could it be that a straightforward, inexpensive treatment that raises core body temperature by 1.0-1.2\u00b0 C is sufficient to help improve cardiovascular fitness in people with CHF? It is too early to say, but there is ample reason for excitement as we await the findings of future studies on the topic that must surely be forthcom - ing. Sometimes the simple, elegant approach to problems yields important answers \u2014 it would be good news for those experiencing CHF, indeed, if such were the case here. n Reference 1.

The Portfolio Diet: A Menu for Hyperlipidemia Treatment A B S T R A C T A N D C O M M E N T A R Y By Susan T. Marcolina, MD, FACP Internist and Geriatrician, Issaquah, WA Dr. Marcolina reports no financial relationships relevant to this field of study. Synopsis: TCVShe cholesterol-lowering foods specified in the portfiolo diet of Jenkins et al are effective treat - ments for elevated LDL-C levels under real world living conditions. Not surprisingly, overall compliance with dietary instructions regarding portions of the four prin -cipal portfolio diet components (tree nuts, soy protein, soluble fiber, and plant sterols and stanols) was signifi - cantly associated with percentage reduction of LDL-C in participants completing the study. Source: Jenkins DJA, et al. Effect of a dietary portfolio of cholesterol-lowering foods given at 2 levels of intensity of di - etary advice on serum lipids in hyperlipidemia. A randomized controlled trial. JAMA 2011;306:831-839. The portfolio diet effectively decreases elevated cho- lesterol levels under metabolically controlled condi - tions and its components (tree nuts, soy protein, soluble fiber, and plant sterols and stanols) are all FDA-approved foods that can claim heart-healthy benefits. This prospec - tive single-blind, controlled, parallel-design study con - ducted across four Canadian medical centers evaluated the effects of two intensities of portfolio dietary counseling (intensive, consisting of seven total face-to-face counsel - ing sessions, vs routine counseling with only two clini - cal counseling sessions over the 6-month study interval) compared to a control diet (dietary counseling focused on low fat dairy products, fruit, vegetables and whole grains, excluding specific portfolio components) on 345 hyperli-pemic participants (62% female). Inclusion criteria speci - fied men and postmenopausal women in the low (0-10%) and intermediate (10-19%) Framingham 10-year risk cat - egories LDL-C values ranging from 135-205 mg/dL and 116-178 mg/dL, respectively. During the 6-month study period, dietitians counseled participants to follow weight-maintenance vegetarian di - ets from foods purchased in grocery and health food stores. Dietitian counseling sessions were 1 hour in duration for the initial visit and 30-40 minutes at subsequent ones. For the dietary portfolio interventions, dietitians incorporated the specific study foods into the 7-day food diaries of par - ticipants. To further facilitate the daily incorporation of the correct portions of each of the portfolio components, participants received a 7-day food checklist with an il-lustrated reference booklet ( See Table 1 ). Consumption of peas, beans, and lentils also were encouraged. All par - ticipants received measuring utensils to facilitate portion control compliance. None of the participants took lipid- lowering medications during the study and all lost similar amounts of weight (average loss of 1.2 kg, 1.7 kg, and 1.5 kg for the intensive portfolio, routine portfolio and control diets, respectively). Adherence to the four port - folio components was estimated from 7-day food records kept by each participant, and mean adherence was found to be 46.4% for the intensive and 40.6% for the routine portfolio diets. Lipoprotein profiles and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels were obtained at weeks 0 and 24 after dietary treatments. The investigators noted statistically significant aver -22 February 2012 age reductions in LDL-C levels of 13.1% ( P < 0.001) and 13.8% (P < 0.001) for the routine and intensive portfolio diets, respectively from baseline compared to a 3.0% ( P = 0.06) reduction in the control diet. The percentage LDL-C reductions for each dietary portfolio arm were signifi - cantly greater than the control diet with P < 0.001, for both. There were no significant changes in triglycerides or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. These results were comparable to LDL-C reductions ob - tained with a combination of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol plus first-generation statin therapy with lovastatin. 1 The LDL-C decrements were accompanied by statistically significant decreases in the TC:HDL-C ratios of 8.2% and 6.6% for the routine and intensive dietary portfolio interventions, respectively. There were no sig - nificant differences between the dietary portfolio inten-sities on the lipoprotein profiles. None of the treatments significantly altered C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. The intensive dietary portfolio significantly reduced dia - stolic blood pressure an average of 2.1 mm compared to the control diet, but did not significantly reduce systolic blood pressure. The authors concluded that hyperlipidemic patients could significantly lower their LDL-C with the portfo - lio diet and two sessions of dietary guidance and support over a 6-month period. Given that the patients bought and prepared their own foods during this time, the results demonstrate that this dietary intervention is both feasible for use in the outpatient primary care setting and produces important measurable improvements in LDL-C, an im - portant risk factor for coronary artery disease. Since the patients in this study were predominantly white (79%), with low to intermediate cardiovascular risk, the findings cannot be generalized to other, more diverse, higher risk populations. n COMMENTARY Reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is the objective for hyperlipidemia treatment and gener - ally statins are the drugs best proven to accomplish this, particularly in patients with established cardiovascular disease ([CVD], secondary prevention), diabetes, and in patients without established CVD but at high risk for car - diovascular events (Framingham 10-year risk estimate > 20%). However, for patients at lower risk, as in this study, or for patients who have had adverse effects from or wish to avoid pharmacotherapy, counseling for diet and physi - cal activity modification is the foundation for primary CVD prevention, since dietary approaches can lower total cholesterol, LDL-C, and triglyceride levels, and regular exercise can raise HDL-C levels and lower triglycerides. Thus, both approaches combine to improve the athero - genic lipoprotein profile as well as overall physical and cardiovascular fitness. 2 Since this was not a clinical out - comes study, however, further evaluation is necessary to determine whether cholesterol reduction through the ad-Table 1 .

Nonpharmacologic treatment of hyperlipidemia with the Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes approach has been a recommended initial treatment by the Adult Treatment Panel III of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) for more than a decade based upon its review of the available evidence in 1999. 3 The Mediterranean diet also has been recognized as a heart-healthy diet that em - phasizes intake of tree nuts, monounsaturated fats (such as olive oil), fish, fresh fruit, and vegetables; limited in - take of red meat and poultry; and moderate consumption of red wine. The portfolio diet of Jenkins et al provides a multifac - eted approach to improving lipoprotein profiles that offers patients the option to adopt a few or all of the compo - nents, depending upon their motivation, food tolerances, underlying cardiovascular risk factors, and lipoprotein levels. The four food elements of this diet contribute to - ward lipid-lowering effects. Tree nuts have an FDA-ap-proved health claim for decreasing risk of heart disease if eaten as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol. Since they are calorically dense, a 22.5 g serving most days of the week should be incorporated isocalorically. Almonds are used in the portfolio diet, but walnuts or pe - cans consumed isocalorically as a 1.5 ounce serving are also FDA approved for the primary prevention of heart disease. Brazil nuts, macademia nuts, cashews, and some types of pine nuts, however, are excluded because of their high saturated fat content. 4 Plant sterols or phytosterols have a chemical structure similar to cholesterol and compete for absorption in the digestive tract. Intake of 2 g of plant sterols reduces LDL cholesterol by approximately 10%, while higher doses do not further augment cholesterol-lowering effects. They are available commercially in the form of spreads such as Promise and Benecol. 5 Soy protein promotes enhanced insulin sensitivity in addition to its beneficial effects on lipoprotein profiles.6 Other foods recommended in the portfolio diet, such as fruits and legumes, are low glycemic index foods and rich sources of antioxidants and soluble fiber. In a separate randomized, controlled, 1-month cross - over study separated by a 2-week washout, Jenkins et al evaluated the effects of the daily addition of 454 g of strawberries (112 kcal) in place of sweets or an isocaloric portion of oat bran bread to the portfolio diets of hyperli - demic subjects. 7 The strawberry supplementation reduced oxidative damage to LDL-C, measured as thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, while maintaining the reduc - tions of LDL-C and TC/HDL-C from the portfolio diet and enhancing its palatability. 8,9 Another specific fruit enhancement to the portfolio diet is the addition of kiwis, particularly if triglyceride levels are not at NCEP goal. In a small Norwegian randomized, crossover study, consumption of 2 kiwi fruit/day for 28 days reduced triglyceride levels by 15% and platelet ag - gregation by collagen by 18% compared to the control group. 10 The present study demonstrated that two moderately short counseling sessions over a 6-month period on the portfolio diet (routine portfolio counseling) are suitable in the ambulatory setting and produce measurable, statis - tically significant lowering of LDL-C levels and salutary effects on HDL-C in free living (and eating) adults. The study subjects did not have any serious adverse reactions to the prescribed diet, although soy and tree nut allergies are valid reasons for eliminating one or more elements of the diet. Only two study subjects experienced skin rash- es, one from soy and one from almonds, and both had positive skin tests that required them to discontinue study participation. The portfolio diet offers versatile ways in which hy - perlipidemic individuals can use daily food choices as op - portunities to improve their LDL-C numbers and possibly their CVD risk. Testing the portfolio diet in more diverse patients with clinical outcomes may clarify the use of these specific foods for cardiac risk reduction. n References 1. Jenkins D J, e t a l.
