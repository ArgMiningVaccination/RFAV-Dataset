Dear Alaskans, We know that a child's health is influenced by their daily surroundings and the options their families have available. Children born in Baby-Friendly USA certified hospitals are more likely to get the best nutrition possible, breastmilk. Families that choose to participate in WIC increase their access to healthy food choices and can have free nutrition and breastfeeding education, counseling, support, nutritious foods and referrals to needed services. Families that enroll in a childcare center that is committed to best-practices can improve what their children eat and drink. A committed childcare center can increase a child's daily physical activity, help reduce their screen time, support families, and help both families and children develop a foundation of healthy habits for life. We want to better support Alaska's youngest children and their families in their pursuit to grow up at a healthy weight free from preventable disease. Obesity increases the chances of developing diseases that last a lifetime, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease and many types of cancer. Medical care related to obesity costs Alaskans $459 million annually. State and federal governments pay for more than 25% of these costs in the form or Me dicare and Medicaid.1 In this report, we explore a variety of behaviors, experiences, societal norms, practices and policies related to physical activity and nutrition that are known to impact a child's lifelong health. We look at the simple things in life such as eating meals together as a fam ily and the more complex, such as a mother and infant's experience in the hospital. We intend for those of us invested in Alaska's young children to use the information presented in this report. Reports about trends, counts and percentages are often considered dry and boring. But, since you are reading this, you know the importance. If we do not know where our families struggle, where our children are unsupported we cannot provide solutions. If we do not monitor our progress we cannot tell if we are making a difference. Please join us in using this report to make informed decisions, select evidence-based solutions, strengthen commitment for those solutions, and inspire action. We want to make a positive difference in the lives of Alaska's children and th eir families and we hope you will join us.

Introduction Report Highlights Overweight and obesity: More than one in three (35%) Alaska 3-year-olds are overweight or obese, which increases their chance of developing weight-related chronic diseases. Overweight/obesity prevalence among Alaska 3-year-olds did not change between 2008 and 2014. Overweight/obesity prevalence among 3-year-old children is significantly lower among children of White mothers than of Alaska Native mothers, and lower in higher socioeconomic status (SES) families compared to low-SES families. Breastfeeding: 93% of Alaska mothers initiate breastfeeding of their babies and initiation rates did not change significantly between 2012 and 2017. 42% of Alaska babies are breastfed exclusively through 6 months. Half (51%) are fed breastmilk up to 12 months. Among Alaska mothers who had ceased breastfeeding before 8 weeks, almost 20% stated it was because they went back to work or school. In 2018, 3.4% of Alaska births occurred at Baby-Friendly USA certified hospitals. By 2020, we estimate 19% of births in Alaska will occur at a certified hospital . Child care: One of every five (21%) Alaska 3-year-olds is cared for regularly at a child care center, preschool, or Head Start program. 41% of Alaska mothers of 3-year-olds use some type of child care arrangement on a regular basis. Cost is a prohibitive factor for two-thirds (67%) of mothers of 3-year-olds who are not using their preferred type of child care. Beverages and screen time 28% of Alaska 3-year-old children drink a sugary drink every day. Alaska 3-year-old children in: o low SES families were more likely to consume sugary drinks than those in higher SES families, 39% vs 21%. o the Northern and Southwest regions were significantly more likely than children in other regions to consume sugary drinks. Children of Alaska Native mothers are significantly more likely than children of White mothers to consume a sugary drink on a typical day, 57% vs 17%. 77% of Alaska 3-year-olds have an hour or more of screen time (watching television, movies, or video games) on a typical day. Only 13% of Alaska 3-year-olds typically drink fat-free (skim or nonfat) and low-fat (1%) milk as recommended by the US Dietary Guidelines. Alaska Early Childhood Physical Activity, Nutrition and Obesity Facts Report Page 2 II. Early Care and Education in Alaska Early care and education (ECE) and quality child care positively impact children, families, and communities . ECE can improve children's development and act as a protective factor against the future onset of adult disease and disability.2 The ECE sector in Alaska is comprised of a wide variety of programs and providers that includes licensed child care centers, family child care homes and child care group homes; Head Start and Early Head Start programs; public and private pre-elementary school programs; military child care providers; tribally -approved child care providers; and an unknown number of unregulated/non-licensed providers. ECE programs that serve low-income and at-risk children can counteract the disadvantage some children experience and provide them with an equal opportunity to achieve school readiness, and lifelong employment, income, and health. Participation in Head Start has been associated with reductions in body mass index (BMI) and obesity.3 ECE center policies may directly impact what children consume and how active they are, as well as help them develop a foundation of healthy habits for life. ECE programs can implement national standards and best practices to improve what children eat and drink, increase their physical activity, reduce their screen time, and support families who breastfeed.4 In Alaska, there are an estimated 39,000 children under six years of age potentially in need of child care (children in two-parent families, both parents in labor force and children in single-parent families, parent in the labor force).5 A survey conducted in 2015 of Alaska households with children under 13 years of age showed that 55% of children under six years of age typically received care by someone other than a parent or guardi an at some time during the month preceding the survey.6 Among children under six years of age who received care the month prior to the survey: 41% were in pre-elementary school or licensed center-based care 34% received care at someone else's home 2 CDC.

All other licensed child care facilities in the state are regulated by the State of Alaska Department of Health and Social Services, Child Care Program Office (CCPO). Licensed child care facilities in Alaska and the MOA include7: 221 Child Care Centers 260 Family Child Care Homes 76 Child Care Group Homes (Includes foster group homes [no more than 8 children in care] and residential group homes [no more than 12 children in care])8 The total capacity for these licensed facilities in Alaska is 17,307 children.8 In Alaska there are 14 centers that are not licensed, but are approved by CCPO or monitored to ensure they meet or exceed state licensing regulations. These include Department of Defense, Coast Guard, and Tribally Approved or Certified sites. Head Start and Early Head Start Head Start (ages 3-5) and Early Head Start (birth-3 years) are federally-funded programs specifically serving low-income and at-risk children. Head Start programs are typically center-based, while Early Head Start can be provided in a center or through home visits. Most Head Start programs in Alaska are not licen sed, but grantees receive funding from the Alaska Department of Education and Early Development (EED) to support quality activities in Head Start programs. 17 grantees operate 107 Head Start programs9, reaching 2,501 children8 9 grantees operate 21 Early Head Start program, reaching 498 children10 (Some grantees have both Head Start and Early Head Start programs.) 7 US Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children & Families, Early Childhood Training and Technical Assistance System.

These programs are exempt from licensing, but may become licensed to access federal Child Care Development Funds (CCDF). 11 school districts have Pre-K programs in 295 schools/sites (2017/18 school year)10 All Head Starts have to apply for EED Pre-K approval (which is why they are exempt from licensing)11 Tribally -Approved Child Care Providers Child care sites and family child care providers may be tribally-approved, but not state approved or licensed. These providers can receive federal Child Care Development Block Grant (CCDBG) Tribal Allocations to run their programs. 30 grantees distribute CCDBG funds to an unknown number of providers in 2018.12 In 2006, there were close to 280 tribally-approved child care providers.2 (More recent data are not available.) 10 Alaska Department of Education and Early Development.

Nutrition Assistance Programs for ECEs and Families with Young Children Child and Adult Care Food Program The Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) is a federally-funded, state-administered program that provides healthy meals and snacks to children and adults receiving day care. It plays a vital role in improving the quality of day care and making healthy meals more affordable for low-income families. In Alaska, participating sites include: 219 Child Care Centers (includes Head Start Programs) 230 Family Child Care Homes8 Women, Infants and Children Program The Women, Infants and Children Program (WIC) is a federally-funded, state-administered public health program providing nutrition and breastfeeding education, counseling, support, nutritious foods, and referrals to needed services. WIC serves low-income and at- risk babies and children up to age five, pregnant women, and new mothers. In Alaska: 43.5% of income-eligible women, infants, and children participated in WIC in 2016 o 56.8% of eligible infants participated o 56.7% of eligible children age 1 participated o 38.5% of eligible children age 2 participated o 36.1% of eligible children age 3 participated o 27.7% of eligible children age 4 participated13 Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is a federally-funded, state- administered program that provides food benefits to supplement the budget of low-income families. In Alaska, there are (data from 2018, unduplicated count): 14,228 SNAP households with children age 5 years or younger 21,102 children age 5 years or younger that received SNAP benefits14 13 US Department of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Service.

Weight status Classifying Weight Status For the purposes of this report, weight status for people of at least 2 years age is indicated by body mass index, or BMI. BMI correlates with amount of body fat and can be used to estimate risk of weight-related health problems. BMI is a useful measure because the calculation requires only height and weight, is easy to analyze, and provides a good approximation of obesity and overweight prevalence across the population.15 BMI is calculated using the formula: BMI = weight (in kg)/[height (in m)]2. Classifications , healthy weight , overweight , and obese are determined by the following BMI levels for adults: Weight Classification for Adults BMI Classification < 18.5 Underweight 18.5 to less than 25.0 Healthy Weight 25.0 to less than 30.0 Overweight 30.0 Obese Because children and adolescents are still growing, their weight status is determined by referencing calculated BMI to age- and sex-specific growth charts. Percentiles are the most commonly used indicator to assess the size and growth patterns of individual children in the United States. The percentile indicates the relative position of the child's BMI number among a standardized set of children of the same sex and age. For 2 to 20-year-olds, the resulting percentile is used to identify weight status, according to the following: Weight Classification for 2- to 20-Year-Olds BMI for Age Percentile Classifica tion < 5th Underweight 5th to less than 85th Healthy Weight 85th to less than 95th Overweight 95th Obese Weight Classification for under 2-Years-Old For children under 2 years of age, this report includes the classification of high weight-for - length. High weight-for -length is defined as 2 standard deviations above the sex and age - specific median in the World Health Organization (WHO) growth standards.16 15 Additional information about BMI can be found at this site: https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/index.html 16 Information on WHO growth charts can be found at this site: https://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/who_charts.htm Alaska Early Childhood Physical Activity, Nutrition and Obesity Facts Report Page 7 Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) Participant s Figure 1. High weight- for-length ratio, Alaska WIC 3-23 month olds, 2008-2014^ Source: Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) Participant and Program Characteristics ^At the time of this publication, 2014 was the most current state-specific WIC PPC results available. The percentage of Alaska WIC-enrolled children age 3-23 months with a high weight-for - length decreased between 2008 and 2014 from 19% to 14% . The percent children with a high weight-for length in 2014 is significantly less than in 2008. Among WIC 3-23 month olds, boys have consistently had a higher prevalence of high weight-for -length than girls. WIC-enrolled children are not necessarily representative of Alaska's overall 3-23 month -old population. Alaska Early Childhood Physical Activity, Nutrition and Obesity Facts Report Page 8 Figure 2 .

Excess maternal weight gain by pre-pregnancy weight status, Alaska, 2017 Source: Alaska Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) The Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommendations for weight gain during pregnancy consider both infant and maternal health. The recommendations are based on a woman's pre-pregnancy weight status and differ if the mother is pregnant with one child or twins. T he best health outcomes for both mother and child are achieved when women start their pregnancy at a healthy weight and gain the recommended amount of weight during pregnancy17. Approximately half of Alaska mothers were overweight or obese just before thei r pregnancy (data not shown). In half of all Alaska births in 2017, mothers exceeded the recommended amount of maternal weight gain. Mothers who were overweight or obese just before their pregnancy were significantly more likely to experience excess maternal weight gain than were healthy-weight or underweight mothers. In 28% of births, the mother gained within the recommended weight range (data not shown). 17 Institute of Medicine and National Research Council, 2009.

Breastfeeding A. Initiation Figure 20. Breastfeeding initiation by age of mother^, Alaska, 2012-2017 Source: Alaska Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) ^Age of mother at the time the child was born Breastfeeding, with its many known health benefits for infants, children, and mothers, is a key strategy to improve public health.18 In the United States, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) currently recommends:19 Infants should be fed breast milk exclusively for the first 6 months after birth. Exclusive breastfeeding means that the infant does not receive any additional foods (except vitamin D) or fluids unless medically recommended. After the first 6 months and until the infant is 1 year old, the AAP recommends that the mother continue breastfeeding while gradually introducing solid foods into the infant's diet. In recent years, over 90% of Alaska mothers have initiated breastfeeding ; this is well above the Healthy People 2020 target of 82%.20 Breastfeeding initiation rates did not change significantly between 2012 and 2017. 18 The Surgeon General's Call to Action to Support Breastfeeding.

While Alaska's breastfeeding initiation rates are well above the Healthy People 2020 target of 82%21, health disparities exist in breastfeeding initiation for Alaska infants. Breastfeeding initiation in 2017 was significantly higher among White mothers than among Alaska Native mothers or mothers of other races. Initiation was also significantly higher among Alaska Native mothers than among mothers of other non-White races. Although over 90% of mothers in lower-SES households initiated breastfeeding, the rate of initiation was significantly higher for higher-SES households. 21 Healthy People 2020 [Internet].

The major reasons mothers reported stopping breastfeeding is useful to health professionals when helping mothers overcome breastfeeding barriers and to devise targeted breastfeeding interventions. Among Alaska mothers who had initiated but then stopped breastfeeding at the time of the survey (typically around 8 weeks): Over half (56%) stated they thought they were not producing enough milk. Almost one of five (19%) stated they went back to work or school. Almost one of five ( 18% ) stopped because they felt it was the right time to do so.

It does not include Diet drinks (such as Crystal light and diet soda). 28% of Alaska 3-year-olds drink some sugary drink on an average day . This combined measure of all sugary drinks (28.3%) and is only slightly different from the percent of Alaska 3-year-olds who drink sweetened fruit drinks (27.7%). This suggests that the 11% of 3-year-olds who are drinking soda are also drinking sweetened fruit drinks. Disparities exist in sugary drink consumption among Alaska 3-year-olds: Alaska 3-year-old children of Alaska Native/American Indian mothers were significantly more likely than children of White mothers to consume a sugary drink, 57% vs 17%. Low SES 3-year-old children were more likely to consume sugary drinks than higher SES children, 39% vs 21%.

Data Sources Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) is an ongoing, population- based surveillance system designed to identify and monitor selected maternal behaviors and experiences that occur before and during a woman's pregnancy and during the early infancy of her child. PRAMS was developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Division of Reproductive Health in 1987 as part of an initiative to reduce infant mortality and low birth weight. The Alaska PRAMS Project was initiated by the State of Alaska, Division of Public Health, Section of Maternal, Child and Family Health in 1990. PRAMS was designed to supplement data from vital records and to generate data for planning and assessing perinatal health programs in participating states. Because PRAMS data are population-based, findings from data analyses can be generalized to an entire state's population of women having a live birth. PRAMS is designed not only to generate state-specific data, but also to allow comparisons among states through the use of standardized data collection methods. Currently PRAMS operates in 51 project sites and surveillance covers approximately 83% of all U.S. births. Each site utilizes the same core questions and adds a limited number of its own state--specific questions. Topics covered include preconception health; prenatal care; use of tobacco and alcohol and other substances; insurance coverage; breastfeeding; intimate partner violence; infant sleep environment, and life stressors such as illness, job loss, debt; plus many other topics. In Alaska, approximately one of every six mothers of newborns is selected for PRAMS. Mothers are surveyed approximately 2 to 6 months after delivery of their baby. See http://dhss.alaska.gov/dph/wcfh/Pages/mchepi/prams for more information about PRAMS questionnaires and methodology. Race definition for PRAMS Race refers only to the race of the mother as reported on the birth certificate. For the purposes of this report: \"Alaska Native\" refers to women who identify as Alaska Native or American Indian, either alone or in combination with other races. \"White\" refers to women who identify as White alone. \"Other\" refers to women who identify as any race other than Alaska Native (alone or in combination) or White (alone). Alaska Early Childhood Physical Activity, Nutrition and Obesity Facts Report Page 58 Mother's age grouping Mother's age grouping (less than 25 and 25 years or older) were dichotomized and presented in this report to explore behaviors and access to services of younger mothers . The World Health Organization and United Nations have identified those 24 years and under as a period needing special attention.41 Additionally research has pointed to a number of changes in the brain and behavior which have implications for young adult health care. 42 It has been noted that during the transition years (age 19 - 25), individuals receive few preventative health visits43, lack of transition services44 and lack health insurance.45 Due to these circumstances we determined the difference were worth exploring and dichotomizing the results by age. Childhood Understanding Behaviors Survey (CUBS) Alaska Childhood Understanding Behaviors Survey (CUBS) is a program designed to find out about the health and early childhood experiences of young children in Alaska. CUBS collects information by conducting a follow-up survey to the Alaska Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS). PRAMS sends a survey to approximately one of every 6 mothers of newborns in Alaska, and CUBS sends a follow-up survey three years later to all mothers who completed PRAMS and are still living in Alaska. CUBS asks questions about both the mother and her child. About 90 Alaskan mothers are sent a CUBS survey every month. The purpose of CUBS is to provide information on health conditions, health care utilization, child development and other health related behaviors of young children and to evaluate the association between prenatal and immediate postnatal factors with early childhood health and welfare. Survey responses are weighted so that the reported prevalence accurately describes all mothers of 3-year old children born in Alaska in a single calendar ye ar. See http://dhss.alaska.gov/dph/wcfh/Pages/mchepi/cubs/default.aspx for more information about CUBS questionnaires and methodology. Race definition for CUBS Race refers only to the race of the mother as reported on the birth certificate. For the purposes of this report: 41 World Health Organizat ion.

St udent Weight Status Surveillance System (SWSSS) SWSSS is comprised of Alaska student weight status data obtained voluntarily from partner school districts that have contributed their data as a means of monitoring obesity trends. Participating school districts provide the Department of Health and Social Services (DHSS) de-identified student data (i.e., measured height and weight, age, and sex). DHSS conducts the analysis to generate body mass index (BMI) percentile, and the associated weight status classifications of underweight, healthy weight, overweight and obese, as described in the Introduction, Classifying Weight Status. SWSSS data differs slightly from othe r data sources by reporting 'American Indian/Alaska Native' on breakdowns by race because that is how the school district partners classify the data. School districts across the state vary in the grades for which they routinely collect height and weight data. Some districts aim to measure and weigh every student, every year, while other districts target only students in Kindergarten, 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th grades. Analysis scales measurement results to represent the enrolled population for each grade . Anchorage and Matanuska-Susitna Borough school districts combined are used in Healthy Alaskans 2020 and in this report because they have the longest trend and represent a large proportion of students in the state (15% of Kindergarten students in 2017-2018) . The following school districts have participated in SWSSS in various years since its inception: Anchorage, Dillingham, Kenai Peninsula Borough, Ketchikan Gateway Borough, Kodiak Island Borough, Lake & Peninsula, Matanuska-Susitna Borough, Nome, North Slope Borough, Petersburg, and Sitka. Individual school district weight status reports are available at http://dhss.alaska.gov/dph/Chronic/Pages/Obesity/weightstatus.aspx Alaska Early Childhood Physical Activity, Nutrition and Obesity Facts Report Page 60 Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Nutrition Program WIC is a supplemental food and nutrition program for pregnant and breastfeeding women and their children from birth to age 5. Alaska WIC provides nutrition information, counseling, breastfeeding support, and periodic health screening, along with supplemental food vouchers for infant formula and healthy foods. Children's height and weight are measured and recorded by a health care professional at clinics as part of the application and renewal process. Alaska data are available at the United States Department of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Service website: https://www.fns.usda.gov/pd/wic- program . Maternity Practices in Infant Nutrition and Care (mPINC) Survey In 2007, CDC administered the first national survey of maternity care practices related to breastfeeding to every facility in the United States and territories that routinely provided maternity care services. Known as the Maternity Practices in Infant Nutrition and Care (mPINC) survey, this survey is a national census of facilities routinely providing maternity care. The initial survey established measures of practices in place at intrapartum care facilities across the United States and territories and showed how the practices varied by state. CDC administered the survey every other year thereafter until 2015 to monitor and examine changes in practices over time. After the 2015 administration, CDC redesigned the survey to reflect changes in maternity care practices that had occurred in the United States over the past decade. The newly designed survey launched in 2018. Each survey year CDC screens hospitals by telephone. CDC contact s the mother-baby nurse manager or the manager of the labor and delivery unit to help identify the best person to complete a survey that includes questions about infant nutrition, such as breastfeeding, using formula to feed healthy newborns, and feeding routines. Because CDC follow this process each time that we administer a new survey, the person identified to receive the survey one year is not necessarily the person identified to receive the survey in a later cycle. Alaska Early Childhood Physical Activity, Nutrition and Obesity Facts Report Page 61 National Immunization Surveys (NIS) Each year, CDC's National Center for Immunizations and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD), in partnership with the National Center for Health Statistics, conducts the National Immunization Survey (NIS). The NIS uses random-digit dialing to survey households with children and teens. The telephone survey asks questions about childhood immunization. Beginning in July 2001 and continuing through December 2002, a subsample of respondents was asked about breastfeeding. Starting in January 2003, all respondents with children aged 19 to 35 months are asked the breastfeeding questions. The Council of American Survey and Research Organizations response rates for landline sample of NIS years 2001 -2017 ranged from 51.9% to 76.1%. Response rates for the cellular telephone sample of NIS years 2011 -2018 ranged from 24.6% to 33.5%. A more detailed description of the methods can be found at the National Immunization Survey "}
