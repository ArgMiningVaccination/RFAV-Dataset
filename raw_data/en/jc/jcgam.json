Lead is harmful to the human body, especially for children and pregnant women. Lead can harm the brain, and make it hard for children to learn, pay attention, and behave. A person with lead poisoning may not look or feel sick. Even when a person has no symptoms, lead can harm the kidneys, increase the chances of having a miscarriage, increase blood pressure, and cause death from heart attack or stroke. The only way to know if you have lead in your body is with a blood test for lead. What should I do? Kesaria Balguti Talk to your doctor before taking any Ayurvedic remedies.
