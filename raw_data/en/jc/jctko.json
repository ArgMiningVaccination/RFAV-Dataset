Researchers from Duke University Medical Center conducted a single -group experimental study examining the effectiveness of SICPT in the treatment of moral injury (MI) in the setting of PTSD. Given the initial results from this treatment, which was administered by a psychologist on the faculty of Duke University, the findings after completing the first three cases are being reported here. SICPT is a 12 -session one -on-one individual intervention administered over 6 -12 weeks using a cognitive processing therapy framework. Results indicated that even while severity of MI symptoms did not always change much, PTSD symptoms in all three cases dramatically decreased as MI was address ed. This supports the hypothesis that MI , which is often ignored by mental health professionals , may often serve as a barrier to the effective treatment of PTS D -- especially in war veterans . The researchers concluded: \"Given the effects of SICPT on reducing both MI and PTSD symptoms, we have decided to report these early results prior to study completion to alert the scientific community about this potentially effective new treatment.\" Citation : O'Garo, K. G., & Koenig, H. G. (2023). Spiritually - integrated cognitive processing therapy for moral injury in the setting of PTSD: Initial evidence of therapeutic efficacy. Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease , in press Comment : Although the curr ent report describes only the initial three cases enrolled in the intervention , this is the first report o n the effects of SICPT in patients with both moral injury and PTSD . Note that all parti cipants were at least somewhat religious. For more info rmation on SICPT, go to the following article: Pearce, M., Haynes, K., Rivera, N. R., & Koenig, H. G. (2018). Spiritually integrated cognitive processing therapy: A new treatment for post - traumatic str ess disorder that targets moral injury. Global Advances in Health and Medicine , 7, https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2164956118759939 . Concerns about Religion in the Treatment of Moral Injury in Canadian Veterans Walter Callaghan, a PhD candidate in anthropology at the University of Toronto, is the author of this article that critically examines the role that religion plays in the treatment of moral injury (MI) in Canadian Veterans. First, the aut hor emphasizes how different US religious culture is from Canadian religious culture, indicating that only 68% of Canadians report a religious affiliation and only slightly more than 50% indicat e that religion is important in their lives, contrasting this to the U.S., where 77% indicate a religious affiliation [9% more than Canadians ]. Second, the author discusses conversations with 5 Canadian Veterans ( out of 20 Canadian Veterans participating in a qualitative study) who ra ised questions and concerns about incorporating religion into psychotherapeutic treatment for MI. The author goes on to emphasize how past negative experiences with religion may be a source of MI, may thereby exacerbate MI, or may redirect the perso n away from the actual cause of the MI , i.e., a person or organization (Canadian Armed Forces). The author emphasizes that the approach taken among \"American Christian Veterans\" cannot be taken among Veterans of the Canadian Armed Forces, whose religious c ulture is so vastly different (?). The author concludes: \"...this article amplifies concerns voiced by Veterans that should be considered when applying an American Christian conceptualization of religion and spirituality to non -American, non - Christian indivi duals or contexts.\" Citation : Callaghan, W. (2023). Critical intercession for non - religious Canadian Veterans on the intersections of moral injury, religion, and spirituality. Journal of Military, Veteran and Family Health , 9(2), 91 -95. Comment : This repor t was based on qualitative interviews on the topic of MI with a highly select group of Canadian Veterans who had negative attitudes toward religion. A concern with qualitative research is that the views of the researcher may affect the interpretation of informat ion retrieved from interviews , as well as the choice of individuals interviewed . Whether this was the case here (or not ) is unclear from th e present brief report. Nevertheless, while the author may have overemphasized the differences between Canadian and U S Christian culture, he does point out the potential ly negative effect s of bringing up religion in the treatment of MI in nonreligious or atheist Veterans , some of whom may have been hurt by religion in the past . In this day of patient -centered treatmen t, howe ver, most therapists do not introduce religion to non-religious patients or force it on atheists or agnostics. Instead, a spiritual history is first taken and if the patient is not religious, then there are many non -religio us treatments for MI that can be implemented . However, for the vast majority of Veterans in the US (and we might argue Canada as well) who are at least somewhat religious, spiritual approaches may be quite useful (see O'Garo & Koenig above) . New Moral Injury Symptom Scale Research ers from the department of psychiatry at the University California , San Diego , and other institutions report on the development of a new moral injury distress scale in this article. The Moral Injury and Distress Scale (MIDS) is described as a new CROSSROAD S... Exploring resea rch on relig ion, spiritua lity and health CROSSROADS... 2 measure o f emoti onal, cognitive, behavioral, social, and/or spiritual sequelae of potentially morally injuriou s events (PMIE s). Since only the abstract is available, description of the scale and its validation here is limited. The MIDS is an 18 -item scale that was psychom etrically examined in a sample of 1,232 military veterans, healthcare workers, and first responders. Results : Psychometric charact eristics indicated that the 18 items contributed to a single factor representing moral distress. The full -scale h ad goo d internal consistency (Cronbach's = 0.95), acceptable 2 -week test -retest reliability (r=0.68), convergent validity PMIE exposur e measures, guilt and shame (r=0.69 -0.69), and had strong correlations with PTSD, depression, and insomnia sy mptoms (r=0.51 -0.67). The measure was also a strong predictor of functioning. The authors concluded: \"The MIDS is the first scale to assess moral i njury symptoms indexed to a specific PMIE that is validated across several high -risk populations.\" Citation : Norman, S. B., Griffin, B. J., Pietrzak, R. H., McLean, C., Hamblen, J. L., & Maguen, S. (2023). The Moral Injury and Distress Scale: Psychometric evaluation and initial validation in three high -risk populations. Psychological Trauma: Theory, Research, Pra ctice, and Policy . Advance online publication : https ://doi.org/10.1037/tra0001533 . Comment : Readers should be aware of the newest scales being developed to measure MI symptoms. Whether this scale has any particular advantage over the existing scales is yet to be determined. Religious Coping and the Experi ence of Guilt and Shame in Young Adults Investigators in t he department of psychology at the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, and at John Jay College of Criminal Justice/City University of New York Graduate Center, conducted a cross -sectiona l surve y of 425 college students (average age 19.5 years, 7 6% female , 44% Catholic, 49% Hispanic/Latinx ). Participants were categorized into those w ith and without a history of physical and/or sexual abuse (145 with and 280 without ). The purpose was to exa mine th e relationship between positive /negative religious coping and experiences of guilt or shame. Religious coping was assessed using the 14 -item Brief RCOPE (7 items assessing negative and 7 items assessing positive religious coping). Guilt and shame we re asse ssed by the 16-item Guilt and Shame Pron eness Scale (GASP; Cohen et al., 2011), which measures the dispositional tendency to experience guilt and shame emotions. The scale consists of two guilt proneness subscales (\"guilt negative behavior self -evaluation\" and \"shame withdrawal\"). Participants were also asked about any history of physical and sexual abuse , which were used to categorize participants into no abuse, any abuse, s exual abuse only, physical abuse only, sexual and physical abuse). Structur al equation modeling was used to analyze the data. Results : Positive religious coping (PRC) was positively associated with \"guilt repair\" ( the tendency to engage in reparativ e iors following the moral transgression) , \"guilt negative evaluation\" (tendency to feel bad about how one is acted), and \"shame withdrawal\" (tendency to try to avoid the unpleasant situations in which moral transgressions have occurred) ; however, PRC was ne gatively associated with shame negative self - evaluation (tendency to make internal, negative self -attributions due to one's moral transgressions). Negative religious coping (NRC) was also associated positively with shame withdrawal, and among those with no abuse history, with shame negative self - evaluation. Researchers concluded : \"Results suggest that positive religious coping is more closely related to guilt proneness, and negative religious coping to shame proneness.\" Citation : Ladis, I., Abrams, D ., & Ca lkins, C. (2023). Differential associations between guilt and shame pronen ess and religious coping styles in a diverse sample of young adults. Journal of Interpersonal Violence , 38(1-2), NP670 -NP697. Comment : Fascinating study among young individual s of mi litary age, which may provide clues about the relationship between religious coping and moral injury . The findings probably apply to young adults whether inside or outside of the military (althoug h perhaps more to females , since 76% sign of particip ants were women) . Of course, t he psychopath with no religious tendencies or morals is probably best off with regard to moral injury , since they often lack persistent feelings of shame or guilt over moral transgressions . Integr ated Religious CBT for Women with B reast Cancer in Iran: A Randomized Controlled Trial Researchers from the Islamic Azad University in Bandargaz, Iran, conducted a randomized controlled trial involving 178 women with breast cancer and psychological symptoms . Psychological symptoms we re assessed by the Symptom Checklist -25 (SCL -25). Participants (breast cancer patients referred to community healthcare centers affiliated with Mashhad University of Medical Sciences) were randomized to either the intervention group (n=89) or a wait -list control group that received no intervention (n=89). Those in the intervention group received eight weekly 120 -minute group sessions of IRCBT. Participants were ages 30 or above (the majority ages 40 -49 years) with a primary school education or higher and Mu slim re ligious affiliation. Participants were excluded if they had any kind of spiritual therapy before the study, a major psychiatric disorder, physical health problems, or used psychotropic drugs. Outcomes were assessed before and after the intervention by the SCL-25. Multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) was used to compare the two groups at baseline and follow -up. Results : There were no significant differences between the two groups at baseline on any of the eight SCL -25 subscale scores. After the intervention at follow -up, however, there was a significant difference between mean scores of the two groups independent of baseline differences. Those in the IRCBT group experienced significantly lower levels of anxiety, depression, paranoid thoughts, phobia , and interpersonal sensitivity compared to those in the control group (all p<0.001); no differences were found between groups with regard to obsessive -compulsive symptoms, somatization, or neuroticism . be useful fo r impro ving negative psychological symptoms among Iranian women with breast cancer.\" Citation : Sharifi, M., Saeidi, S., Koenig, H. G., Dadfar, M., & Turan, Y. (2023). The effect of integrated religious cognitive behavioral therapy (IRC BT) on psychological symptom s of women with breast cancer. Mankind Quarterly 63 (4), 617 -635. Comment : IRCBT should not be confused with RCBT as developed by the Duke University research group. Both the content of the sessions and the delivery method (group therapy) were diffe rent in IRCBT . Nevertheless, the results appear quite impressive, particu larly in this relatively large randomized controlled trial. A Spiritual Health Curriculum for Medical Students in Iran Academician s in the Spiritual Health Research Center at the Ir an University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, described the educational objectives, content, teaching, and assessment methods for a spiritual health curriculum. This curriculum is designe d as a masters' degree program in spiritual health for professionals within the field of medical sciences. The purpose is to train providers to initiate comprehensive care in the area of spirituality as a standar d part of healthcare . They describe the process of curriculum development based on Tyler's curriculum development mo del, utilizing experts from a number of healthcare disciplines to come to a consensus on the most important elements of such a program CROSSROADS... 3 and how to teach it. Both core courses and non -core courses in the program are described and discussed. The authors conc lude: \"The spiritual health curriculum is designed to incorporate spirituality into the curriculum planning process, encompassing goals, content, educa tion implementation, and evaluation.\" Citation : Nahardani, S.

Shiraz E - Medical Journal , 24(4), 1-8. Comment : Although written specifically for the training of Iranian health professionals , academic fa culty developing curricula for health professional students in Western countries may also benefit from information provided in this report. Religious Fasting and Student Academic Performance Researchers at the University of Cologne and other universities in Germ any and Switzerland analyzed cross -sectional data from Muslim and non -Muslim countries and also from Muslim and non - Muslim students. Country -specific fasting hours for Ramadan before students underwent academic testing was the primary predictor vari able. The primary dependent variable was test scores determined using two panel data sets from two repeated cross - sectional international student assessment tests: (1) the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS; n=941,869 , conducted i n 40 co untries between 1995 and 2019, including Muslim countries ) and (2) the Program for International Student Assessment Survey (PISA; n=340,856 conducted in 8 Western countries between 2003 and 2018 , including Muslim students ). Fasting hours was utilize d as a measure of intensity of Ramadan fasting. Analyses were dichotomized by Muslim countries and non - Muslim countries (TIMSS), and by Muslim stu dents and non - Muslim students (PISA) . Results : Positive effects of Ramadan fasting intensity were observed on test scores for both data sets. Longer fasting hours were related to increases in student performance across Muslim countries but no t in non-Muslim countries. Likewise, this effect was found for Muslim students scores only in co horts with a large share of co-religionists. Researchers concluded : \"This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that shared experiences during more intensive Rama dans facilitate the formation of social capital and a social identity conducive to learning outcomes.\" Citation : Hornu ng, E., Schwerdt, G., & Strazzeri , M. (2023). Religious practice and student performance: Evidence from Ramadan fasting. Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization , 205, 100 -119. Comment : These researchers explained the positive effects of Ramadan fasting on Mus lim students' academic per formance as due to social factors . Religious factors , however, could also have explained the findings. Religion (Hindu vs. Muslim), Nutrition and Birthweight among Young Women in India Investigators in the department of ge ography at Ravenshaw University in Cuttack, India, analyzed cross -sectional data collected on 379,959 women ages 15 -49 collected during the fifth wave of the National Family Health Survey in 2019 -2021. Participants includ ed 81.4% Hindu , 13.5% Muslim , and 5.2% oth er religions . Maternal nutrition and baby birthweight were the primary outcomes. Multi -variate analyses were used to analyze the data. Results : Hindu women were more likely to be underweight than Muslim women (14.9% vs. 9.8%, respectively); normal w eight w as slightly more li kely in Muslim that in Hindu women (60.4% vs. 59.5%, respectively); Muslim women were more likely to be overweight than Hindu women (22.5% vs. 19.3%, respectively) ; and obesity was higher among Muslims than Hindus (7.4% vs. 6.3%, respect ively). There were no significant differences in terms of having low birth weight babies between Hindu and Muslim women (21.4% vs. 21.2%, respectively). Citation : Dandapat, B., Biswas, S., & Patra, B. (2023). Religion, nutrition and birth weight amo ng currently married women (15 -49) in India: A study based on NFHS -5. Clinical Epidemiology and Global Health , 101218. Comment : Very little difference was found between Indian Hindu and Muslim mothers in terms of their nutritional status or the birthweight of their babies. Thus, despite their minority status, Muslim women do not appear to be less nourished or have lower birthweight babies than Hindu women in India. Given the large sample size, these findings are noteworthy . Factors Influencing Health Risk Behavio rs among Teenagers in South Africa Investigators from the department of population studies in demography at Northwest University, Mahikeng, South Africa, analyzed longitudinal data collected on eighth grade students ages 13-18 (average age 14 ) at three poi nts in time between February 2012 and June 2013 . A total of 2,230 -2,950 young persons were assessed following the implementation of a peer intervention program . The intervention program consisted of seven 35 -45 minute structured lessons designed to reduce alcohol use, marijuana use, and premarital sex. The purpose of this report was to identify risk and protective factors for alcohol consumption, marijuana use, a nd premarital sex , comparing them to the effects of the peer intervention program . Multiv ariate regression analyses (general linear mixed models) were used to examine the effects of age, attitude towards the peer intervention program, gende r, place of residence, race, socioeconomic status, family structure, work status, participation in school sports, and participation in religious activities. Results indicated that independent of other risk factors, those who \"always\" participated in religi ous activities (versus never) were one -third less likely to use alcohol (OR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.53 -0.83), 24% les s likely to smoke cannabis (OR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.57 -1.00), and nearly 50% less likely to have premarital sex (OR = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.41 -0.65). Researchers concluded: \"...participating in religious activities played a more retarding role in health risk behavi or than the components of the peer -education program.\" Citation : Osuafor, G. N., Okoli, C. E., & Phateng , R. (2023). Risk and protective factors associated with health risk behaviours among school learners in Western Cape, South Africa. BMC Public Health, 23(1), 1 -11. Comment : Imagine that. Simply regularly participating in unstructured religious activities was more effec tive in preventing alcohol, marijuana, and premarital sex th an was a formal, intentional peer education program consisting of seven 35-45 minute structured lessons . Religious Coping andTelomere Length: New Study Investigators in the department of psychology at the University of Maryland analyzed data from the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Lifespan (HANDLS) s tudy th at included 252 socioeconomically diverse African -Americans and Whites age s 30- 64 years. The cross -sectional relationship between religious coping, race, sex, and telomere length was examined. Telomere length is considered an intracellular biologica l clock that predicts length of the lifespan in mammals, including humans . Religious coping was asses sed by the 2 -item brief COPE (\"I try to find comfort in my religion or spiritual beliefs\" and \"I pray or meditate\"). Religious affiliation was assessed as either present or absent. Linear regression was used to control for sociodemographic characteristics (poverty status, education, emotional social support, instrumental social support, substance use) . Results : Only sex (female) was a significant correlate o f telom ere length (TL) (b=0.20, p=0.04), whereas age was correlated in a marginal way (b=-0.01, p=0.0 7). There was no significant relationship CROSSROADS... 4 between religious coping and TL (b=0.00, p=0.96) or between religious affiliation and TL (b=0.05, p=0.49) . There was no significant interaction between religious affiliation and race or sex in predicting TL . Resear chers concluded: \"There was no evidence to support that religious coping use provided protective effects to TL in this sample of African -American and White women in men.\" Citation : Ashe, J. J., Evans, M. K., Zonderman, A. B., & Waldstein, S. R. (2023). Abs ent relations of religious coping to telomere length in African American and White women and men . Experimental Aging Research , 1-23. Comment : Given the sma ll samp le size and largely non -stressed community population of relatively young age, it is not surpr ising that no relationship was found , particularly with the use of relatively insensitive measures of religious coping and religious affiliation. In fact, the onl y correlates even remotely related to TL among all sociodemographic characteristics were the m ost previously well - known (female gender and older age). Nevertheless, given numerous past studies that have reported a positive relationship between relig ious in volvement and TL, this study is worth noting. Spatial Distribution of Religious Organizations in the U.S. Researchers from the department of economics at the University of Colorado, Denver, and the University of Notre Dame, Indiana, examined the location of 63,000 US reli gious organizations based on Internal Revenue Service filings in 2019 . These data were correlated with socioeconomic data from the 2014 -2018 American Community Survey. The purpose was to examine the physical locations of religious o rganiza tions in order to determine socioeconomic and religious factors predicting their location in relationship to one another. The authors first reviewed literature on the economics of religion based on a \"club\" model with voluntary membership where ther e is competition for limited resources (people) . Spatial statistical methods at the county level were used to analyze the data. Results : Results indicated that the location of religiou s organizations reflect ed economic opportunity, social needs, societal values, and religious conservatism . Religious organizations were more closely clustered together in regions where residents had lower incomes, where there was greater higher economic inequality, and where there was higher unemployment. Researchers conclude d: \"The story of how religious organizations locate is complex. We find statistically significant correlations between organizational clustering and different socioeconomic variables which provides evidence in support of the idea that the locations of reli gious o rganizations depend on factors that are common among different religions.\" Citation : Cheng, E., & Meng, S. (2023). The spatial distribution of religious organizations in the United States and their socioeconomic characteristics . Applied Spatial Anal ysis an d Policy , 16, 789 -812. Comment : This is an interesting article that examines the economic strategies involved in church -planting, survival, and flourishing in a competitive environment for members . Note that according to the most recent estimate in 2012 of the number of congregations in the U.S. is 384,000 , considerably more than reported in the present study [Brauer, S. G. (2017). How many congregations are there? Updating a survey based estimate. Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion , 56(2), 438 -448]. Faith -based Cardiovascular Health Promotion Interventions: A Systematic Review Researchers in the department of health sciences at the University of York and other institution s within the United Kingdom conducted a systematic review of 24 databases (including gray literature sources) on March 30, 2021 , to examine the effectiveness of faith - based cardiovascular health promotion interventions . Three researchers screened and extr acted the data. Several quality assessment tools were used, including the Cochran risk of bias, ROB -INS I and E, and Joanna Briggs Institute's Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument. Results : A total of 24 publications contributed data to the review. Faith -based interventions included cardiovascular health/disease teaching, teaching/encouragement of personal psychological control, promoting exercise/physical activity as part of a normal lifestyle, nutrition change for cardiovascular health, conducting cardiovascular healt h measurements, and opportunistic blood pressure checks. Effects of these interventions three months after the intervention included significant mean systolic blood pressure [SBP] reductions (average 2.98 mmHg, 95% CI = -4.39 to -1.57) and reductions in mean diastolic blood pr essure [DBP] (average 0.14 mmHg (95% CI = -2.74 to 3.01) . Twelve ( 12) months after the intervention, significant mean SBP reduction of 0.65 mmHg (95% CI = -0.91 to -0.39) and non -significant DBP reduction of 0.53 mmHg (95% CI = -1.86 to 0.80) were found . There was also a significant mean reduction in weight of 0.83 kg (95% CI = -1.19 to -0.46), and non -significant reduction in mean waist circumference of 1.48 cm (95% CI = -3.96 to 1.00). The author s concluded: \"In addressing the global hy pertension epidemic the cardiovascular health promotion roles of faith institutions probably hold unrealized potential. Deliberate cultural awareness, intervention contextualization, immersive involvement of faith l eaders and alignment with religious pract ice characterize their deployment as healthcare assets.\" Citation : Sanusi, A., Elsey, H., Golder, S., Sanusi, O., & Oluyase, A. (2023). Cardiovascular health promotion: A systematic review involving effectiveness of faith-based institutions in facilitating maintenance of normal blood pressure. PLOS Global Public Health , 3(1), e0001496. Comment : Although mean effects on blood pressure and weight were not huge, it is likely that many individuals benefited greatly from these faith -based programs (while others did not) . The \"Why me\" Question: What Patients Mean and How They Answer Psychiatrist Robert Klitzman from Columbia University in Ne w York City conducted a secondary qualitative analysis using data from several qual itative studies exploring how patients view and cope with various life -threatening and or/disabling medical conditions. The purpose was to determine what patients mean by the question \"why me ?\" Results : When patients ask, \"why me?\", t his may have a variety of meanings that involve a complex set of social processes. While largely recognizing there is no answer to this question, patients nevertheless ask it, seeking to understand the roles that unknown factors and chance play in dise ase causation, reflecting the psychological stress of illness, and expressing frustration over the absence of any definitive answers. Patients often wonder if God or randomness is involved. They wonder whether they have been singled out and are being punished for something that the y have done. The answers they come up with may vary at different points in the illness. Social contexts can also influence this process. Emotions such as anger, depression, and despair can also shape these processes. The researcher conclude d: \"These data, the first to exa mine key aspects and meanings of the phrase, \"why me?\" have critical implications for future practice, research and education.\" Citation : Klitzman, R. (2023). \"Why me?\": Qualitative research on why patients ask, what they mean, how they ans wer and what factors and processes are involved. Social Sciences & Medicine - Mental Health , 3, 100218. Comment : An insightful article that explores what is going on in the patient's mind when they ask the question \"why me?\" and factors that influence th is question . Asking \"why me \" seems to be a normal human response to sometimes unbearable pain and suffering that persists on and on . CROSSROADS... 5 Healthcare Chaplains ' Challenges and Insights when Engaging with Patients and Families Klitzman and colleagues from the depa rtment of psychiatry masters of bioethics program at Columbia University conducted in - depth qualitative interviews with 23 chaplains to determine the challenges, insights and variations in experience when entering rooms and engaging in discussions with pat ients and families. Results : When chaplains enter patients' rooms, the y first seek to \"read the room,\" i.e., follow patients /families ' leads, look for verbal and nonverbal cues, assess the energy/mood in the room, and use body language , while remaining o pen-ended in their communications. Chaplains decide on whether to communicate through clothing, such as clerical collars or crosses, or to remain neutral in their dress when interacti ng with members of religious groups different than their own. O ther insight s are also provided in this article. The authors conclude: \"These data, the first to examine challenges chaplains confront entering patients' rooms and engaging in non -verbal communication, can enhance understandings of these issues, and help c haplains and other health professionals provide more sensitive and astute context - based care.\" Citation : Klitzman, R., Di Sapia Natarelli, G., Sinnappan, Garbuzova J. (2023). \"Reading\" the room: healthcare chaplains' challenges, insights and var iations in entering rooms and engaging with patients and families. Journal of Health Care Chaplaincy , EPUB ahead of press . Comment : This article will be useful to chaplains and other healthcare professionals seeking to meet the spiritual needs of patients /family members in a sensitive and person -centered manner. Who Owns Spiritual Care? Psychologists Irene Harris (Minneapolis VAMC) and Anne Klee (West Haven Connecticut VAMC) examine who the most appropriate professional is for addressing the spiritual conc erns of patients. This paper introduces a special section of the journal Psychological Services whose purpose was to facilitate discourse and dissemination of resources for chaplains and psychologists to explore the interdisciplinary dynamics of spiritual care and to establish a basis for expanding spiritually -integrated care . After addressing the gap in psycholog y training related to spirituality and religion, they discuss chaplains as an important resource that psychologists can access when spiritual conc erns are relevant to mental health. They go on to discu ss the ethics of spiritually integrated care, the effect the COVID -19 pandemic has had on the need for spiritual ly-integrated care, and describe examples of effective collaboration s between chaplains and psychologists, such as the Building Spiritual Strengths pr ogram (developed by Harris for addressing moral injury and PTSD in Veterans) . The authors conclude : \"Seeing multidisciplinary relationships previously characterized by distrust and separation, no w coming together to meet a groundswell of a collective need for spiritual and emotional healing, is a desperately needed light of hope for the future.\" Citation : Harris, J. I., & Klee, A. (2023). Who owns spiritual care, and why does it matter? Psychologi cal Services , 20(1), 1 -5. Comment : This lead article that introduces the Special Section and all of the articles in that section should be of interest to both psychologists and chaplains interested in providing spiritual care to patients in a collaborative manner. There is little doubt that this is critical in addressing the whole person care needs of persons with mental illness. NEWS Full Day Online Workshop on Moral Injury There has been growing interest in the topic of \"Moral Injury\" \u2014 the internal emotional turmoil experienced as a result of transgressing moral values, which initially received attention in active -duty military and veterans following combat operations , but now has expanded to inc lude first responders , healthcare professionals , and others exposed to severe trauma .

This is a condition that often occurs in the setting of severe trauma. MI involves painful and often disab ling emotions that are manifested by psychological, spiritual, and religious symptoms. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and MI are two distinct conditions, both of which need treatment. Failure to recognize this may result in protracted and unsuccessfu l treatments for PTSD. This book provides preliminary criteria for MI as a disorder for future inclusion in DSM and ICD diagnostic classification systems. We believe that military chaplains are those best suited to address MI among active -duty Service Mem bers and Veterans , in terms of prevention, identification, and treatme nt. In this book, we provide information for military and VA chaplains about the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of MI. We believe that the readiness of our warriors for combat oper ations , and reintegration into society after departure from the milita ry, is dependent on the role that military and VA chaplains play. MORAL INJURY: A HANDBOOK FOR MILITARY CHAPLAINS, extensively referenced and scientifically grounded on the latest research, is designed to equip chaplains with the knowledge and tools that t hey will need to accomplish this mission. Available on Amazon Kindle for $0.99 and paperback for $8.42 at: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BRJK1PVB . This handbook also serves as a syllabus for a 3 -day cours e on MI for cha plains; for further information, contact harold.koenig@duke.edu . Spiritual Readiness: Essentials for Military Leaders and Chaplains (Amazon Kindle, 2022 , 286 pages ) Spiritual readiness (SR) is the strength of spirit that enables the warfighter to accomplish the mission with honor. Maintaining SR is essential for members of the U .S. Armed Forces and their allies in order to keep the peace and, when necessary, win wars. SR influences all other asp ects of warrior readiness - psychological, social, behavioral, and physical. Intended for military leaders , military chaplains , and VA chaplains , this book reviews concerns about warrior readiness , concerns underscored by widespread reports of mental healt h problems and lack of psychological, social, and behavioral fitness. The book discuss es how to measure SR to establish a baseline and then track over time. Non-religious and religious sources of SR are then examined from Eastern, Indic, and Abrahamic fai ths. Human flourishing is defined and examined in relationship to warrior readiness. The relationship between SR and human flourishing is then explored, illustrated by a theoretical causal model. Systematic quantitative research is then reviewed that explores how religious involvement affects both (a) the pathways that lead to human flourishing and (b) human flourishing itself. The question of who is responsible for building and sustaining SR in the military is then addressed (gover nment CROSSROADS... 7 decision -makers, military leaders, behavioral health specialists, medical providers, and especially, military chaplains) , followed by a series of chaplain interventions designed to prevent or treat emotional problems that diminish SR. The book conclu des with a series of pra ctical recommendations for military leaders to enhance SR among those under their command .

Theology , Medicine, and Culture Initiative The Theology, Medicine, and Culture Initiative at Duke Divinity School invites you to consider both residential and hybrid opportunities for theological study and spiritual formation: Theology, Medicine, and Culture Fellowship The fellowship is a residential graduate program that provides in - depth Christian theological formation for those with vocations to health care - both those in training and those who are established in their practice. Some fellows study with TMC for one year, completing a Certificate in Theology and Health Care; others study with TMC for two years and receive a Master of Theological Studies (MTS). All F ellows receive a minimum of 50% tuition support, and there is a limited number of 75% to full tuition scholarships for those completing the MTS. Flexible Hybrid Certificate in Theology and Health Care (hybrid CTHC) The hybrid program offers robust and practical theological formation for clinicians seeking to inhabit contemporary medicine and health care faithfully an d creatively. Through two residential weeks of study at Duke (one in August, one in January) and two semesters of online learning with TMC faculty, clinicians discover manifold ways that Christian faith matters for health care while remaining embedded in t heir local contexts. All hybrid CTHC students receive 25% tuition support from Duke Divinity School. For more information on both these programs, go to: https://tmc.divinity.duke.edu/ FUNDING and MISC.

CROSSROADS... 9 Religiosity, Spi rituality and Healt h: Request for Paper Proposals The Study on Stress, Spirituality, and Health (SSSH) invites paper proposals for analyses on the topic of religi on and/or spiritual ity (R/S) and health. The SSSH dataset is a unique resource for investigating the direct influences of R/S on risk of developing various chronic conditions; the stress pathway as a mechanism through which R/S may operate to influence dis ease etiology; and the intersection of psychosocial stress, racial/ethnic disparities, and positive mediating resources for resiliency. SSSH data include cleaned and harmonized de -identified survey data (R/S beliefs, practices, and experiences; childhood a nd adulthood psycho social stressors), biomarker data (telomere length, candidate gene and epigenome -wide DNA methylation), and associated covariates from diverse participants across four longitudinal cohort studies . Consideration will be given for proposal s utilizing the R|S Atlas database. Review the Catalyst Fund Guide for appl ication details. Templeton Foundation Online Funding Inquiry The next deadline for Small Grant requests ($234,800 or less) and Large Grant requests (more than $234,800) is August 18, 2023. The Foundation will communicate their decision (rejection or invitation to submit a full proposal) for all OFIs by October 13, 2023. Therefore, researchers need to think \"long -term,\" perhaps collecting pilot data in the meantime, with or without fun ding support. JTF's current interests on the interfac e of religion, spirituality, and health include: (1) investigating the causal relationships between health, religion, and spirituality (determining direction of causation in associations reported; identi fying the underlying causal mechanisms responsible ), with a specific foc us on longitudinal studies , and (2) engaging religious and spiritual resources in the practice of health care (increasing the religious and spiritual competencies of health care practi tioners ; testing the impact of religiously integrated therapies; and increasing the scientific literacy of health care More information: https://www.templeton.org/project/health OF EVENTS...
