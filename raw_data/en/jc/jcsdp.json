SELECTION CRI TERIA/PROCESS: Alameda Boys & Girls Club, Inc. , Center for Ea rly Intervent , Multicultural Instit ute, Preventive Care Pathw ays, and Street Level Health Project (Attachment A; Nos. 1-4, 6, 8, 9) were selected through a public hearing process held on 1/24/11 in the B oard of Supervi sors' Chambers a t 1221 Oak Street, Oakland, CA 946 12. The selection process included reviewing a recommenda tion of providers and fund ing allocation submitted by HCSA , the public hearing on 1/24/11, and Board approval on 4/12/11 (Item N o. 9 B-C). The Board of Supervisors reauthor ized th ese base allocation s and providers on 11/6/12 (Item No. 14) , 12/8/15 (Item No. 5) and 1/15/19 (Item No. 9.1). Multicultural Institute and Street Level Health Project were identified as providers serving a unique population , described as \"Health Serv ices for Day Laborers\" in the Measure A budget. The allocation to Preventive Care Pathways is identified as \"Dire ct M edical and Support Services (Oakland)\" in the Measure A budget. In 2006, HCSA and the Probation Depa rtment jointl y designed medical servic es to be offered at the ne w Alameda County Juvenile Justice Center. It was determined that integrated health serv ices would be provided, and an informal procurement was conducted looking at the following criteria: qual ity of servic es, cost of service, repo rting and data collection capacity; experience with at -risk youth; and expertise with youth and young adults in the justice system. Niroga Institute (Attachment A; No. 7) was selected because 1) its business model mak es it one of the few affordable prov iders of integrated practice, 2) its commitment to careful evaluation and data - driven analysi s was unique among providers surveyed, 3) it had demonstrated effectiveness in serving youth and young adults involved with the Juvenile Justic e system, and 4) it was the only local provider of these services with a demonstrated track record with at -risk y outh. This allocation is identified as \"Medic al Costs for Juvenile Justice Health Services\" in the Measure A budget. The Honorab le Board of Supervisors June 28, 2021 Page 3 of 4 LifeLong Medical Care (Attachment A; No. 5) was selected as th e contractor for the Heart 2 Heart Program based on a review by represen tatives of the HCSA , Board of Supervisors District 5, and the City o f Ber keley Health Officer. LifeLong secured start -up fundin g for the program, was experienced in deli vering chronic disease prevention services in the target community, and proposed a mode l of prevention that integrated primary care best practice, communit y emp owerment, and resident engagement. Spectrum Community Services, Inc. (Attachment A; No. 1 0) and Love Never Fails (Attac hme nt A; No. 1 1) were selected by District 2 and District 4 , resp ectively, under the Board of Supervisors' Measure A allocations. HCSA works directly with each s upervisory office to ensure that all selected pr ograms comply with th e Measure A ordinance and are approved by the full B oard of Supervisors. All these providers, except f or the Cit y of San Leandro, are non -profit, community -based organizations providing direct services to county residents and are exem pt from the requireme nts of the Alameda Cou nty Sma ll, Local and Emerging Business (SLEB) Program. The City of San Leandro is a gove rnment entity and is therefore ex empt from the requirements of the Alameda County SLEB Program. FINANCING Fund ing for th ese recommendations ($952,047 ) comes from Measure A and is included in the HCSA FY 2021 -22 Approved Budget . Approval of these recommendations will have no impact on net County costs.

Street Level Health Project is an Oakland -based grassroots organization dedicated to improving the health a nd wellbeing of underserved urban immigrant communities in the Bay Area. Our community center is an entry point to the health care and social service system for those most often overlooked and neglected, namely the uninsured, underinsured, and recently arr ived. Founded in 2002 by two pre -med students, Street Level Health Project has become the \"safety net of the safety net\", and serves as a critical entry point in the health care and social service system for the medically uninsured. Our programs include: Health Access Program, where we connect clients to local health care providers and offer basic health care; Immigrant Rights and Empowerment, where we offer health and safety trainings, job referrals, and leadership development opportunities; and our Well ness and Prevention Program, where we improve health by providing educating, case management, food access program.

Our ability to provide linguistically app ropriate medical, mental health and nutrition prevention services makes SLHP a key referral site to various community agencies including: Community Health for Asian Americans, Health Care for the Homeless, various AA groups, Casa del Sol, Highland Hospital , school based health programs, and La Page 3 of 10 Clinica De La Raza. Current data demonstrates that 70% of referrals made to SLHP are from a friend, family or acquaintance. 3.
