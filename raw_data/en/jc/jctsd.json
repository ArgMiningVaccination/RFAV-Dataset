It increases collagen production and is essential for boosting the immune system. It also plays a crucial role in preventing cell damage caused by free radicals. Free radicals are unstable atoms that can damage cells, causing illness and aging. High levels of vitamin C have been associated with a lowered risk of heart disease, hypertension, and stroke. Vitamin C is readily available in many foods such as fruits and vegetables. But when we try to take vitamin C by mouth it can sometimes cause stomach upset or even diarrhea. Getting Vitamin C from our diet is important and possible, but sometimes that's just not enough. When you need high-dose Vitamin C, that's where we can help. High Dose Vitamin C delivered intravenously is administered directly into the body through an \"IV Infusion.\" This helps to bypass the gastrointestinal tract completely and mitigate these side effects. When it is infused directly into the bloodstream, it bypasses the digestive and metabolic system and has a 100% absorption rate by cells. People with a vitamin C deficiency can feel fatigued and depressed, but even those with adequate vitamin C levels can experience these moods. A high-dose of IV vitamin C can significantly improve mood by fighting against free radicals that cause oxidative stress. Oxidative stress in the body can cause neuropsychological disorders like depression and anxiety. An increase in lead in the body has been linked to Alzheimer's disease and lead poisoning, but a mega dose of vitamin C is an effective treatment in repairing the damage. Studies on both children and adults have shown that a higher vitamin C intake results in lowered blood lead levels. One in three Americans suffer from high blood pressure, which can put the body at risk for heart disease. Hypertension, another name for high blood pressure, can be reduced by taking high-doses of vitamin C. Vitamin C has been shown to reduce both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in adults. Cancer is a difficult and devastating diagnosis to receive, resulting in an overall decrease in quality of life. While chemotherapy and radiation therapy are powerful interventions against cancer cells, they often result in many painful side-effects and unpleasant symptoms. High doses of vitamin C can be utilized to counteract or lessen some of these symptoms. Vitamin C IV infusions can be utilized as an adjunctive cancer therapy that can help lower the severity of many of the uncomfortable side-effects of the chemo drugs, as well as possibly slow down the progression of malignant tumors. Increased levels of vitamin C have been shown to improve the lives of cancer patients significantly. Vitamin C obtained by diet and supplements alone aren't enough to provide adequate relief as digestion through the GI system makes the nutrient less bio available. Even if the same amount of the nutrient is administered orally, the body isn't able to fully utilize it. The amount of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) needed to make a real beneficial impact can only be reached intravenously. Our powerful vitamin C IV therapy can help. Ascorbic acid is necessary for many operations that support resistance. Although everyone needs sufficient levels of vitamin C, this is so much more necessary for cancer patients. The immune system works overtime in response to cancerous cells, and a lack of vitamin C hinders this process. Unfortunately, those with cancer are extremely depleted of their ascorbic acid, lowering their body's defense and worsening uncomfortable symptoms. When exposed to high concentrations of ascorbic acid via intravenous route, cancer cells have been noted to increase their uptake of dehydroascorbic acid (DHA), ultimately leading to their death. This has significant implications on the treatment of cancer, as it helps eliminate harmful cells without impacting healthy ones. Large doses of vitamin C have been shown to decrease the amount and size of tumors in animals. In some clinical trials, vitamin C infusions helped patients with symptom management, decreased tumor mass, enhanced resistance, and prolonged survival in terminal patients. Vitamin C IV infusions are a good adjunctive treatment option, as they can support or boost the effects of traditional cancer treatment methods, as well as minimize their toxicity and side effects. Additional benefits include: Carcinogens can increase the number and growth rate of tumors, as they expose your body to a toxic environment. We understand that the optimal path to treatment is highly individualized and truly a personal choice. Because of this, we are happy to join you in your journey to improved health and achieving your wellness goals. Upon request, we will gladly collaborate with your oncologist and other medical professions to develop a comprehensive treatment plan tailored to your needs. Lab work will be required, prior beginning high dose IV-C infusions and active monitoring throughout the process. If you are utilizing Vitamin C Infusions as supportive therapy, in addition to your chemo therapy, we ask that your Oncologist be informed of your plan and we are happy to update your care team with your IV therapy plan and progress at our clinic. For best response and results, IV-C infusions are typically prescribed frequently until the tumor stops growing, or the patient is consistently cancer-free. After this, infusions are tapered off. Glutathione IV may also be suggested as complimentary treatment with Vitamin C. Please note that our high dose Vitamin C treatment protocols and adjunctive cancer care with IVC as a chemotherapeutic and biological response modifying agent protocols are informed by in-depth study of the available literature and guided by the Riordan IVC Protocol. At Third Circle Medical, we care about your health and want to support and assist with your journey to wellness.
