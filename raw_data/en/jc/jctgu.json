Once you become dependent on crystal meth, your brain loses its capacity to produce adequate levels of dopamine on its own. This means you need crystal meth or other dopamine-producing drugs to enjoy positive feelings. If you were to quit using meth, you would struggle with low feelings such as suicidal thoughts, depression, and anxiety. However, with the assistance of a meth detox center, you can help your brain rebalance and reclaim its ability to produce dopamine from healthy activities once again. What Happens if You Try to Quit Meth? Trying to quit crystal meth on your own can lead to various withdrawal symptoms. If you notice the following symptoms in yourself or a loved one when discontinuing meth, you can be sure that addiction is present: - Overwhelming fatigue and exhaustion, excessive sleeping - Psychological distress, paranoia, nervousness - Feeling depressed and hopeless - Intense cravings The withdrawal symptoms are a sure sign that you need professional help.
