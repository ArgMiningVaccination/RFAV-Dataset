Natural remedies can also be integrated into first-line conventional types of treatment. These can include lifestyle changes, developing healthy habits, incorporating self-soothing practices, and establishing a strong supportive network. Making lifestyle adjustments\u2014eating healthier, improving sleep, exercising regularly, using stress-reduction techniques, and fostering a supportive environment\u2014can lessen your anxiety and make it more manageable. *Check with your doctor before starting any new routines, supplements, or lifestyle changes* If you are looking to control your [anxiety](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/anxiety/), these 22 remedies could help bring you natural anxiety relief: 1. Journal About Your Anxiety Before figuring out how to approach your anxiety, assess your situation. Whether on paper, a computer screen, or smartphone; writing things down or journaling can help you identify the signs, symptoms and underlying triggers. Using [anxiety journaling prompts](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/journal-prompts-for-anxiety/) and writing down your thoughts is also a good way to relieve the stress associated with many daily burdens. Consistent daily journaling can offset the harsh effects of stress, make the anxiety feel more manageable, and bring longstanding benefits to your overall mood and wellbeing.1 Journaling can help you: - Clarify and organize your thoughts and feelings to gain self-awareness - Identify factors that may be contributing to your anxiety - Process negative thoughts and emotions as a way of coping - Reframe self-defeating thoughts to gain perspective about adverse events - Discover unnecessary stressors and create a plan to eliminate them - Brainstorm about problems in your life to find possible options or solutions 2. Eat Nourishing Foods Improving your diet and/or following the recommended dietary guidelines can promote overall good health and can prevent chronic medical conditions. Moreover, scientific findings demonstrate that a well-balanced diet can also support psychological health, cognitive functioning and build resilience throughout your lifetime.2 Avoiding [foods that cause anxiety](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/foods-that-help-with-anxiety/) while incorporating [foods that help anxiety](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/foods-that-help-with-anxiety/), such as foods that contain omega 3 fatty acids, magnesium, zinc, B vitamins, vitamin C, and Vitamin E, amino acids like lysine and arginine, combined with a multivitamin and mineral supplements could help prevent and alleviate anxiety symptoms.3 3. Cut Back On (or Eliminate) Caffeine Caffeine in the short term may help you focus, but long term it can leave you feeling jittery and actually activate your fight or flight response. Caffeine can make the anxious feelings worse due to the increase in activity it can cause on the body. It stimulates the central nervous system and too much caffeine can send you into overdrive. 4. Consider Quitting Smoking Smoking cigarettes is actually linked with a higher likelihood of anxiety. When you smoke while you have anxiety, the nicotine impairs natural brain activity, leading to more anxiety. Quitting smoking can help reduce anxiety by allowing the natural processes in the brain to occur. Also, establishing a baseline of anxiety without cigarettes is important on the anxiety healing journey. 5. Limit Your Alcohol Consumption Limiting your alcohol consumption is one of the best choices you can make to reduce your anxiety. Though drinking may lead to short-term relief from symptoms, the risks usually outweigh the perceived positives. Alcohol will have a long-term negative impact on your mood, anxiety, and sleep. 6. Get the Right Amount of Sleep [Sleep](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/sleep-mental-health/) plays a fundamental role in our overall physical and mental health. Getting enough consistent sleep allows us to replenish and recharge, consequently promoting mind and body resilience to mitigate daily stressors. Regularly skimping on sleep can have detrimental short-term and long-term consequences affecting our brain function, mood, immune system, and other mental/physical aspects. Good quality of sleep (infrequent nighttime awakenings, consistent sleep schedule, 7-8 hours of nightly sleep) has a strong linkage with a decrease in anxiety symptoms.3 The amount of sleep that is required each night varies depending on age and other factors. 7. Exercise Consistently Regular [exercise](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/exercise-mental-health/) is great for mental health. Engaging in an ongoing exercise routine is associated with better mental and physical health because physical activity is known to improve cardiovascular health, mood, sleep, stamina, cognitive functioning, daily performance, and overall sense of wellbeing.4,5 Furthermore, some evidence indicates that [exercise can be helpful for individuals who have anxiety](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/exercise-and-anxiety/) and stress related conditions.6,7 Exercising for 20 minutes three times a week at 60%-90% heart rate has been demonstrated to decrease anxiety symptoms.8 Sustaining a regular exercise regimen yields better results and promotes long lasting benefits. *Check with your doctor before starting any new exercise routines or lifestyle changes* 8. Try Deep Breathing Deep breathing and other types of [breathing exercises](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/breathwork/) for relaxation can help manage stress and reduce anxiety symptoms. Deep/diaphragmatic breathing has demonstrated to be an efficient relaxation method benefiting our mental/physical health. Deep breathing increases the amount of oxygen throughout your body, slows down your heart rate, and stabilizes your blood pressure allowing you to feel more centered and in control of your emotions. Regular practice serves as a self-soothing method that can be done anywhere at any time bringing both immediate and long-term benefits.9,10 9. Start a Meditation Routine A vast number of studies have linked [meditation](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/meditation-for-anxiety/) with stress reduction, decreased anxiety symptoms and a greater frequency of optimistic emotions. [Guided imagery for anxiety](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/guided-imagery-for-anxiety/) and meditation (in different forms) engages the mind and body by: encouraging moment to moment awareness, focusing on controlled breathing, and slowing down of intrusive thoughts.

It can also be a great option for those disinclined to participate in other types of exercise.5,7 [Yoga apps](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/best-yoga-apps/) can be a great place to start if you're new to the practice. 11. Try Tai Chi Tai Chi is an ancient Chinese tradition that has evolved into a form of exercise that promotes serenity through a combination of controlled breathing and a series of coordinated flowing movements with gentle physical exercises and stretches. Like yoga, Tai Chi is also considered a safe alternative and/or a complementary treatment for the reduction of stress and anxiety. The physical aspects of both Tai Chi and yoga provide a mental focus and enhance flexibility and balance.11,12 12. Spend Quality Time Outside There are many [benefits of nature on mental health](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/nature-mental-health/), including improving symptoms of anxiety as spending time outdoors helps to regulate mood.

These include using natural oils from plants and flowers to promote wellness and calm in the mind and body. These essential oils come in many scents that can help you relax and improve sleep and mood, as well as help to regulate blood pressure and heart rate. Anxiety-specific oils to consider may include bergamot, lavender, clary sage, grapefruit, or ylang ylang. 14. Get a Weighted Blanket Weighted blankets help anxiety by introducing even pressure on the whole body. This helps to slow down your autonomic nervous system and help you relax when you are trying to sleep. Anxiety impacts sleep hygiene, but a weighted blanket can be a good support for your nighttime routine by improving nighttime anxiety. A blanket that weighs about 10% of your body weight is an ideal weight for you to consider. 15. Use Herbal Supplements Several botanicals and natural supplements have been studied as alternate options to pharmaceutical treatments for reducing anxiety. Although some herbal supplements have shown fair efficacy in treating anxiety and other conditions, more conclusive evidence needs to be gathered.11 Here are five herbal supplements that could help alleviate anxiety: - Lavender (Lavandula Angustifolia) is a flowering plant that can be used in the form of teas and oils for aromatherapy/ massages/baths for a relaxation effect. Research findings suggest that a lavender oil preparation Silexan in capsule form has some efficacy for its calming effects and alleviating anxiety.8 - Chamomile is an herb that comes from daisy-like flowers and was traditionally used for calming nerves, as a sleep aid and to ease an upset stomach. In the forms of teas, tablets and/or, extract it has shown to help relieve stress and anxiety.11 - Valerian (Valeriana officinalis) comes from the root of a plant native to Europe and Asia. It has shown to have a mild calming effect. In the form of tea, tablets, and tincture can help with sleep problems, anxiety, and depression.8 - Passionflower (Passiflora Incarnata) is a climbing vine native to the Americas and was customarily used as a sedative. Some research suggests that this herb can ease anxiety.

An active ingredient in epsom salt is magnesium, which is linked to increased production of serotonin-the active ingredient in anti-depression and anti-anxiety medications. It also helps to relax the muscles and restore red blood cells in any areas of the body that are experiencing inflammation. 19. Utilize Time Management Strategies Time management is a good way to reduce anxiety.

These can directly assist you or direct you to relevant programs. There is always room for expanding your circle of friends and meeting new people. Get involved with activities like picking up a hobby, joining a book club or sport, or volunteering. This can bring you new enjoyment and provide you with an opportunity of meeting like-minded people. 22.
