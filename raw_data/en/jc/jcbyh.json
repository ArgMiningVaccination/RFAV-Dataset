Highly effective, gentle, non-drug options for many common conditions. Homeopathic Solutions With my specialization in clinical homeopathy; I offer unique, powerful and cost-effective homeopathic solutions as part of my Integrative Medical approach. This gives you highly effective, gentle, non-drug options for many common conditions. Benefits of Homeopathy: All Natural Derived from plant, animal, mineral sources Highly effective Inexpensive Safe for adults, children, and infants Have no side effects Can be used with other natural supplements or prescription medication Homeopathy is a system of medicine which involves treating the individual with highly diluted substances with the aim of triggering the body's natural system of healing. It was founded by physician Dr. Samuel Hahnemann back in the 1700's. The word Homeo means (similar) and pathy means (suffering), so Homeopathy means similar suffering. The use of Homeopathic medicines is given on the basis of clinical observation, symptoms and experimentation. The principle is \"like treats like\" that is a substance which causes symptoms when taken in large doses, can be used in small amounts to treat those same symptoms. For example, drinking a cup of coffee can cause sleeplessness. The homeopathic medicine coffea cruda is made from coffee beans and when diluted over and made into small quantities, is used for the treatment of insomnia and helps to alleviate sleep disturbances. Homeopathic medicines (also called remedies) are prepared in special pharmacies using a careful process of dilution and succussion (vigorous shaking). Homeopathic medicines are safe and inexpensive medications that are used to help to alleviate symptoms and to reduce toxicity of other medicines. The medicines have no side effects and either produce the desired effect or have no effect at all. They can be given to individuals of any age. Homeopathic medicines are very effective for many conditions including: - Given alone for the treatment of symptoms, such as runny nose for allergies, cough during colds. rashes, headaches, insomnia and pain during menses to name a few. - Used along with other medicines either prescription, over the counter or herbal preparations. Such as adding a homeopathic for cardiac protection while the individual is on a prescription medication for elevated blood pressure. Or adding a homeopathic for sleep along with an herbal or prescription medication for insomnia. - Given with other medical interventions such as procedures and surgery. For example using a homeopathic for faster bone healing after a fracture that has been either surgically pinned or casted. Success Stories I have used homeopathic medicines for many conditions but had an amazing outcome in a 10 year old girl with persistent allergies. She had been given prescription medications including inhalers, anti-histamines and steroids on a regular basis. She would every winter have worsening symptoms requiring another round of steroids and being placed on antibiotics. Through a combination of homeopathic and food elimination for the first time during the winter she went without her steroids and antibiotics. She continues on homeopathics for prevention and symptom management, including eliminating those trigger foods and is doing well. I also used homeopathy in a woman who had a long history of insomnia. She had tried herbal preparations, acupuncture and prescription medications with little to no success. After beginning homeopathy within three weeks she was sleeping at longer intervals up to 6-7 hours without waking as opposed to waking every three hours. This same woman has now uses homeopathy to help her decrease her anxiety with flying as opposed to using a prescription medication. So why use Homeopathy? It is a natural alternative to prescription medications. It has no side effects and can be given to all ages. It is cost-effective and safe. It is the Ultimate Natural Medicine. "}
