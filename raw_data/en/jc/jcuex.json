Rubella infection in pregnant females can lead to congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). The Japanese government is promoting vaccination to prevent CRS. This study performs a cost-effectiveness analysis of the following four methods: (1) females who wished to become pregnant and partners, with an antibody-titer test; (2) females only, with an antibody-titer test; (3) females and males, without an antibody-titer test; (4) females only, without an antibody-titer test. A decision tree model with a hypothetical cohort of 500 males and 500 females was used for the analysis, and the parameters were obtained from previous studies. The number of avoidances of CRS was defined as the effect. Compared to the case where methods were not implemented, the number of CRS cases that can be prevented by implementing the methods was 0.0115589 by (1) and (3) and 0.0147891 by (2) and (4). The cost effectiveness of (1) to (4) was 287,413,677 JPY, 135,050,529 JPY, 388,524,974 JPY, and 197,744,219 JPY, respectively (1 JPY = 0.00963247 USD). Method (2) was the most cost-effective and did not change by sensitivity analysis. We conclude that the vaccination for females only with an antibody-titer test is recommended.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-03-08", "cleaned_text": "Model Comparisons of the Cost Effectiveness of Rubella Vaccination Method in Japanese Adults [https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9030233](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9030233) [Health Technology Assessment (HTA) of New vaccines and New Target Groups and Impact Evaluation and Effectiveness of Current number of reported cases in 2020 was as low as 99 by the 50th week, probably due to the infection prevention measures undertaken throughout the country to curb the new coronavirus epidemic [ [2](#B2-vaccines-09-00233)]. The number of reported cases of infectious diseases other than rubella is small. For example, as a typical epidemic infectious disease, influenza is prevalent from November to December every year. More than 180,000 cases of influenza were reported in 2019 between 45 and 50 weeks, but only 259 in 2020 [ [1](#B1-vaccines-09-00233)]. In 2020, as a preventive measure against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), many people implemented hand hygiene, maintaining social distance, and voluntary quarantine [ [3](#B3-vaccines-09-00233)]. As a result, it is considered that epidemics of other infectious diseases transmitted by droplets were suppressed in addition to COVID-19. It is unknown how the COVID-19 outbreak and domestic economic activity will coexist. However, if domestic economic activity resumes and people travel back and forth, the number of rubella cases is expected to increase. [4](#B4-vaccines-09-00233)]. In 1989, when infants were vaccinated against measles, it was also possible to select the triple vaccine, measles-mumps-rubella (MMR). The MMR vaccine was suspended in 1993 due to the frequent occurrence of aseptic meningitis. However, in 1995, the rubella vaccination for infants was introduced to control the rubella epidemic. Additionally, as a time-limited measure until 2003, junior high school students born between 1979 and 1987 who had never received the rubella or MMR vaccine were vaccinated. However, the vaccination rate was meager at about 50%, and it was feared that a rubella epidemic would occur when this generation becomes adults [ [5](#B5-vaccines-09-00233)]. In 2013, a rubella epidemic occurred mainly among this generation, and there were more than 14,000 reported cases [ [6](#B6-vaccines-09-00233)]. This large-scale epidemic in Asia, which was thought to be due to the spread of rubella among unvaccinated people, spread to Japan in 2011 [ [7](#B7-vaccines-09-00233)]. Many people who contracted rubella in 2019 were in the same generation as in the 2013 epidemic, and most of them were in their 30s and 40s. In particular, there were about four times as many males as females [ [8](#B8-vaccines-09-00233)]. Under these circumstances, there is a concern that a large-scale rubella epidemic, like 2013, may return. [9](#B9-vaccines-09-00233)]. The government is promoting vaccination to prevent the disease. [10](#B10-vaccines-09-00233)]. This promotion has been notified to the municipalities, and the actual vaccination promotion method is being implemented within the municipal health method framework. Municipalities carry out vaccination promotion methods for adults who wish to become pregnant. The method's content is a subsidy for vaccination-related costs, including a subsidy for the vaccination and a subsidy for the antibody-titer testing. However, the method of implementation differs depending on the municipality, such as the number of subsidies and the target gender. There are two significant differences in the implementation methods. One is whether to target only females or both sexes. Another is whether to carry out an antibody-titer test before the vaccination. The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare recommends vaccination for both adult males and females; however, municipalities need to decide how to implement the methods according to their budgets. Regarding the economic analysis of antibody-titer testing, \u00d6demi et al. conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis for nursing students aged 14 to 18 years in Turkey. They stated that it would be cost effective to implement screening tests before the vaccination [ [11](#B11-vaccines-09-00233)]. Furthermore, Boccalini et al. economically analyzed the appropriate vaccinations for internationally adopted children in Italy. They concluded that antibody testing was more efficacious [ [12](#B12-vaccines-09-00233)]. Meanwhile, Asli et al. concluded in the study of health care workers and students in Turkey that it is better to get the rubella vaccine without the screening tests [ [13](#B13-vaccines-09-00233)]. The proportion of rubella-sensitive individuals in the study by Asli et al. was 3.7% for 18-26 year olds and 4.3% for 27-38 year olds, considerably lower than that of Japanese adults. In a Japanese study, Terada et al. analyzed a model in which the rubella vaccine was administered twice, in infancy and in childhood. The study found that urine screening for rubella antibodies before the second vaccination was cost effective [ [14](#B14-vaccines-09-00233)]. However, the subjects in the study were infants and school children. Currently, Japan's problem is rubella occurring during adulthood. Therefore, a simulation analysis assuming these are necessary. This study focuses on the subjects and the presence or absence of antibody-titer testing and performs a cost-effectiveness analysis of the following four methods: (1) females who wished to become pregnant (herein, female) and partners (herein, male), with an antibody-titer test; (2) females only, with an antibody-titer test; (3) females and males, without an antibody-titer test; (4) females only, without an antibody-titer test. Based on the results, we will make recommendations on how to implement the methods. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Decision Tree Model and Analysis Method [Figure 1](#vaccines-09-00233-f001). The model predicts the number of rubella patients by defining multiple possible states of the cohort and simulating the cohort transiting dynamics between the states. We constructed four vaccination method models: (1) females who wished to become pregnant and partners, with an antibody-titer test; (2) females only, with an antibody-titer test; (3) females and males, without an antibody-titer test; (4) females only, without an antibody-titer test. Then, we compared the effects of the methods being implemented and not being implemented, respectively. 2.2. Parameters [Table 1](#vaccines-09-00233-t001). The incidence rate was estimated based on data from an infectious-disease-outbreak survey [ [15](#B15-vaccines-09-00233), [16](#B16-vaccines-09-00233)]. From the number of reported rubella cases by age group, rubella's incidence rate between the ages of 20 and 40 was estimated, and parameters were set for each gender [ [15](#B15-vaccines-09-00233)]. We obtained population data from e-Stat, which is a portal site for Japanese government statistics [ [16](#B16-vaccines-09-00233)]. [17](#B17-vaccines-09-00233)]. CRS due to subclinical infection was also considered during the calculation. According to the Center for Infectious Diseases, between 2002 and 2014, CRS included 44 cases of rubella during pregnancy, compared to 11 cases with no rubella. Therefore, we assumed that subclinical infection would cause 1.25 times the number of rubella infections during pregnancy, which was included in the calculation [ [18](#B18-vaccines-09-00233)]. [19](#B19-vaccines-09-00233)], it is reported that acquired immunity with the rubella vaccine would last for life or be maintained for at least 15 years [ [19](#B19-vaccines-09-00233)]. Therefore, we did not consider the attenuation of immunity obtained by vaccination. In addition, we did not consider the implementation of a booster vaccination. In fact, municipalities in Japan do not subsidize booster vaccinations. Those who are not willing to be vaccinated are not considered to undergo antibody-titer testing. Therefore, we assumed that the subject was vaccinated if the antibody-titer test determined that vaccination was necessary. [20](#B20-vaccines-09-00233)]. Inpatients were set at 33.3% of the adult-rubella patients, referring to previous studies [ [9](#B9-vaccines-09-00233)]. Except for severe cases, there were complications such as fever and arthritis [ [9](#B9-vaccines-09-00233)]. We assumed that these patients were examined and prescribed in the outpatient department. In setting medical expenses, the hospitalization costs for severe cases were also taken into consideration [ [20](#B20-vaccines-09-00233), [21](#B21-vaccines-09-00233)]. For each symptom of CRS, we estimated the associated medical expenses from the Survey on Medical Benefit Expenditure and the Patient Survey [ [21](#B21-vaccines-09-00233), [22](#B22-vaccines-09-00233)]. [19](#B19-vaccines-09-00233)]. Severe adverse events that occur rarely include thrombocytopenia and encephalitis [ [23](#B23-vaccines-09-00233)]. Further, in this study, the frequency of occurrence of severe cases was set based on a domestic survey [ [24](#B24-vaccines-09-00233)]. The incidence of severe-vaccine side effects and the medical costs were integrated to calculate the side-effect medical costs converted per person. The medical cost of side effects was added to the cost of the vaccination method. [25](#B25-vaccines-09-00233)], therefore, higher-income males have higher medical costs than females. 2.3. Sensitivity Analysis 3. Results [Table 2](#vaccines-09-00233-t002)). [Table 3](#vaccines-09-00233-t003)). The most sensitive parameter is the incidence rate, and when the incidence rate of females was changed from 10 times to 0.1 times in method (2), the cost effectiveness changed from 8,771,901 JPY to 1,397,836,812 JPY. The next most sensitive parameter was the incidence rate of CRS, and when the CRS incidence rate was changed from 2 to 0.5 times, the cost effectiveness of method (2) changed from 65,240,218 JPY to 274,671,152 JPY. The sensitivity of the other parameters was relatively low and did not significantly affect the results. In the sensitivity analysis of all parameters, method (2) was the most cost-effective and did not change. 4. Discussion Future Study [26](#B26-vaccines-09-00233)]. If the specificity is low, the individual in need may not be vaccinated, which is not advisable from the perspective of CRS prevention. In addition, if the sensitivity is low, a person who does not require vaccination may be vaccinated, which is economically wasteful. The vaccine-cost-sensitivity analysis in our study did not overturn the results. Therefore, vaccine sensitivity does not affect the results of this study. However, higher sensitivity and specificity are required to carry out a highly accurate economic analysis and CRS prevention. 5.
