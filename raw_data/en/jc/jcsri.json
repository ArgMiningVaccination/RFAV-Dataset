Most commonly, acupuncture includes the penetration of thin needles into precisely defined points on the skin, though non-needle therapies also can be incorporated into treatment. Non-needle techniques include rubbing or massaging, pressing on a point (acupressure), heating (moxa) or creating suction over an area of skin (cupping). Some acupuncturists also use lasers to stimulate acupuncture points, often including points on the ear. What are the benefits of acupuncture?
