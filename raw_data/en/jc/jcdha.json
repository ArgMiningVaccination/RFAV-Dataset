Off Campus: Health Insurance for Students Students at Ouachita will be responsible for any healthcare that is needed other than the free services that are provided by our Health Services. Ouachita does not offer healthcare insurance policies for students. Certain Programs on campus require students to have insurance, international students (see [international student resources )](/internationalstudentresources.php) and Ouachita student athletes (see [athletics website](https://obutigers.com/)). Student's may visit [www.healthcare.gov](http://www.healthcare.gov/) or there are many independent agents that are available to shop for individual healthcare. It is advised that every student have an insurance card with them while on campus. We advise students to contact their provider prior to attending Ouachita to determine coverage in the Arkadelphia area. Many Healthcare insurance policies require you to use an approved network or doctors, hospitals and clinics. The insurance provider should be able to provide a list of approved healthcare providers in the Arkadelphia area (Zip code 71923). This includes emergencies, medical, mental health, vision and dental. Ouachita Baptist University does not assume financial responsibility for professional services that require physician; medical, surgical, or emergency services: or for hospitalization. Students are financially responsible for any medical, dental, vision, chiropractic and/or pharmacy bills.

[Download immunization requirements for Ouachita Baptist University](/studentdevelopment/ImmunizationRequirementsforOuachitaBaptistUniversityPDFforportal.docx) Recommended Immunizations/Vaccines (not required): - COVID-19. [Learn more about COVID-19 vaccines here.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/index.html) - Arkansas Act 1233 of 1999 requires the Office of Health Services to inform students of a bacterial infection known as meningitis. Although meningitis is rare, individuals who live in close proximity to many others, such as residence halls, have a slightly higher risk of contracting this disease. There is a vaccine available and Ouachita Baptist University recommends that all students living in residence halls discuss receiving this vaccine with their Health Care Provider. Per the CDC meningococcal conjugate vaccines are designed to protect against four serogroups (A, C, W, and Y), while serogroup B meningococcal vaccines help protect against one serogroup (B). There are currently no meningococcal vaccines that can help protect against all common serogroups that cause most meningococcal disease. - The following are immunizations for incoming college students as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the American College Health Association (ACHA). Vaccine-preventable diseases continue to occur on American campuses and this can be a good time to update any immunizations to help prevent these diseases. These are not required only recommended: - - Tetanus/Diptheria/Pertussis (TDAP) - Booster every 10 years - HPV or Human Papilloma Vaccine - Three doses for lifetime immunity - Hepatitis A Vaccine - Two doses for lifetime immunity - Hepatitis B Vaccine - Three doses for lifetime immunity - Influenza Vaccine - Offered Yearly - (Meningitis Vaccine) - Meningococcal Conjugate Vaccines and Serogroup B Meningococcal Vaccines Class & Work Absences: It is the student's responsibility to know the attendance policy of each individual class. The Office of Health Services will give the student a Record of Visit form upon request at the time of the visit. If a student is going to miss classes for an extended period due to medical reasons, then please contact Health Services to discuss the situation and each case will be evaluated individually. Health Services will not give students chapel excuses. Those must be discussed with Chapel Coordinator if there is an issue. Health and Authorization Form: A brief Health and Authorization form must be completed by the undergraduate student and uploaded to their [student Info portal](http://info.obu.edu) prior to their entrance semester.
