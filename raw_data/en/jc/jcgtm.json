But this could change now. This week we shared that we are joining forces towards a breakthrough in malaria vaccine development: The [European Commission](https://be.linkedin.com/company/european-commission?trk=public_post-text) and the [European Investment Bank (EIB)](https://lu.linkedin.com/company/european-investment-bank?trk=public_post-text) are throwing their weight behind the global effort to develop mRNA vaccines against malaria. In the past months, the world has seen the power of the mRNA technology, pioneered by [BioNTech SE](https://de.linkedin.com/company/biontech-se?trk=public_post-text) and others. We are witnessing the start of a revolution in medical science: mRNA technology has been a game-changer in the fight against [#COVID19](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fcovid19&trk=public_post-text). It can be a game-changer in the fight against other diseases too, including malaria. Eradicating malaria is a realistic goal. And now we know that it can be achieved already in this generation. The European Commission and the European Investment Bank will join the global effort through our Infectious Diseases Finance Facility. And we will work together with BioNTech and with some of the main global health actors. This initiative is part of a broader engagement by the [#EuropeanUnion](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Feuropeanunion&trk=public_post-text) for health in [#Africa](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fafrica&trk=public_post-text) and in the developing world. Africa today imports 99% of its vaccines. Our African partners want to end this dependency. And we want to help them achieve this goal.

Just so that not everyone comes to Europe? Ursula von der Leyen, thanks ma'am for sharing. It's quite nice to hear this. But it would be most noble to see it materialize. It's always been known that there can be a vaccination against malaria. However, malaria is not a global health hazard, it's a third world, largely an African problem. So it received less than cursory attention. The speed with which the COVID-19 pandemic has been tackled indicates just how too easy the malaria problem could have long been rested if the will was there. It is obvious though, COVID-19 affects the world, much more the first world. It cannot last. No one but African leaders have the blame for the lingering malaria crisis in Africa. Rather than fund research and development in science, tech, medicine and agriculture, huge budgets are passed annually to fund political hold on power, corruption and national disintegration. Well, in spite of the misgivings relating to racial integration, the entire human race is a community of people inhabiting the same space - the earth. What affects one, has an effect on the other. The first world cannot look good when Africa is ravaged by the scourge of malaria, and all. Therefore, we welcome this news, a call for the rescue, as always (unfortunately so).

What is behind this madness of wanting to vaccinate for anything and everything and especially on the whole planet of diseases which are now well contained by prophylaxis, mosquito nets and repellents and effective and well tolerated traditional care as artemisia annua! millions of children go to bed hungry.For them, do you have an \"vaccin\"? Thank you Well it's great that the EU cares about the Africans and those areas where malaria is a huge problem to health of the population. The EU with its huge resources can invest in EU bio industry to pursue various medical cures. It's business anyways for these medicines will be sold to an Africa where research on things like maleria, sickle cell etc is almost zero. Africa where poor governance, corrupt, embezzlement etc has meant that EU endorses those ills in Africa to keep them down and for this part of EU business to bloom. However, I'm happy that something is being done but if the EU wants to be more effective, hold the African leaders to do their jobs. Help African researchers work on the continent and help improve their prospects and reduce the waste and hate they receive here in Europe. Malaria is mainly in poor countries who have trouble getting the Covid-vaccin. Nice promise. Hope delivery will "}
