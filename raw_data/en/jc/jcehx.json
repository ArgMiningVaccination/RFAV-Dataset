Book signing to follow lecture.TAGS: Cancer? by Bernard Leikind Microwave radiation from cell phones cannot cause cancer by any mechanism, known or unknown. My answer to the question in the title of this essay is... Fuggedaboudit! No way! When pigs fly! When I'm the Pope! In short, No! This essay is a companion to my article of the same title that appears in [Skeptic magazine Vol. 15, no. 4](https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/archives/vol15n04.html), out on newsstands and in bookstores this week. Here I present the shortened non-technical version, and describe what all physicists know to be true about what happens when human tissue or any material absorbs microwave radiation. It is this knowledge that leads me to assert with such vehemence that cell phones do not cause cancer. I will also consider two recent, major epidemiological studies from Europe that correctly showed that there was no relationship between cell phones and brain cancers. A cell phone emits about 1 Watt of electromagnetic radiation. Most of that zooms away to find a cell phone tower. The tissues of the user will absorb a part of this radiation. These tissues include the caller's hand, ear, scalp, skull, and brain. The closer a tissue is to the cell phone's antenna, the more of the radiation the tissue absorbs. For some reason, however, none of those raising fears about cell phones causing cancer are concerned about skin cancers on palms, fingers, or ears. The frequency of the typical cell phone radiation is about 2.5 GHz, two and a half billion flips back and forth per second. The radiation travels at the speed of light \u2014 186,000 miles per second \u2014 and dividing the one by the other and correcting for the units I used for the speed, shows that the wavelength of this radiation is about 10 centimeters or about 4 inches. As the electric fields of the waves pass through the body's tissues, the fields grab and try to shake any molecules or parts of the molecules that they can. These fields like to grab and shake water molecules, and there are plenty available. The fields will grab whatever else they can, which may be all or of parts of many of the critical molecules of biochemistry, such as the DNA in genes, or enzymes, fuel molecules, waste molecules, structural molecules, and so on. All of these molecules exist within the cytoplasm, and they are in close touch with one another. The molecules are quivering, twisting, and shaking, rattling about and transferring energy between each other. During the time \u2014 less than one billionth of a second \u2014 that it would take the cell phone's radiation to shake a molecule or part of a molecule back and forth, that molecule will suffer a thousand or ten thousand collisions with its neighbors. Any energy that the one molecule might begin to gather from the electromagnetic field rapidly spreads throughout all of its neighbors. Coursing nearby to these molecules is a capillary filled with blood plasma and blood cells. This blood is at body temperature. Any extra energy from any source that appears in cells close to the capillaries will transfer into the slightly cooler blood, warming it. The flowing blood will carry the energy throughout the body. The body temperature will increase imperceptibly, and the extra energy will eventually transfer from the skin into the environment. Anyone who puts forward a potential mechanism by which this energy flow, less than 1 Watt, might cause any cancer should notice that he has thereby explained too much. One watt is much smaller than many other natural energy flows that no one suspects might cause cancer. In my Skeptic paper, I show that the average energy production in my body as I go about my life is about 100 Watts. I also show that while I jog on my local gym's treadmill for half an hour, I produce 1100 or 1200 Watts. This energy, produced in my leg muscles, travels throughout my body including my brain, and I sweat a lot. My body's temperature does not change much. No one believes that my frequent treadmill sessions cause cancer. If the cell phone's less than 1 Watt causes cancers, then why doesn't my exercise session's more than 1000 Watts cause cancer? Within the past year the results from two major epidemiological studies appeared in the scientific literature and to great fanfare in the media. Plainly stated, these two different kinds of studies found no evidence to link cell phones and brain cancers. The researchers might have simply said, \"We did these large, carefully designed studies, and cell phones have nothing to do with brain cancer.\" In the major Danish study, the researchers collected data from the entire populations of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Finland. These sensible countries have long provided medical care for all of their fortunate residents. Therefore, the researchers had access to thorough records. Brain cancers are rare, so they must search through large populations to find sufficient cases to draw conclusions. The plan of this study was to compare trends in the incidence of brain cancers from the late 1980s into the mid 1990s when cell phone use was non-existent or rare with the incidence in the first decade of the 21st century when cell phone use was wide spread. They saw no effect. None. Zero. Nada. These researchers believe that cell phones must cause brain cancer somehow to some degree. Therefore, they asserted that perhaps their study was not large enough, perhaps their study did not cover sufficient time, or perhaps the large sample population diluted the effect in susceptible subgroups. They grudgingly admitted that it was possible that their study showed no effect because cell phones do not cause cancer. The other study, known as the Interphone study, is a case-control study. Searching the populations of 13 European nations the researchers found 6000 brain cancer patients. Next, the researchers sought out 6000 more people to form a matched control group. Then the epidemiologists searched their data to see if they could detect suggestions that cell phone use might increase the risk of brain cancer. \"The results really don't allow us to conclude that there is any risk associated with mobile phone use, but... it is also premature to say that there is no risk associated with it,\" the IARC's director Christopher Wild told Reuters. Also: Data from the IARC study showed that overall, mobile telephone users in fact had a lower risk of brain cancer than people who had never used one, but the 21 scientists ... said this finding suggested problems with the method, or inaccurate information from those who took part. Other results showed high cumulative call time may slightly raise the risk, but again the finding was not reliable. \"We can't just conclude that there is no effect,\" said Elisabeth Cardis of the Centre for Research in Environmental Epidemiology in Barcelona, Spain, who led the study. \"There are indications of a possible increase. We're not sure that it is correct. It could be due to bias, but the indications are sufficiently strong ... to be concerned.\" Why aren't these researchers proclaiming the brilliant discovery that cell phones protect against brain cancer? Why do they believe that concern is justified? They are confident that there is no possible way for cell phones to reduce the risk of brain cancer, but they suspect that the physicists might be wrong that there is no mechanism. Physicists have solved the problem of microwave radiation and absorption. We know exactly what happens to the radiation, and there is no fuzzy area about it that we do not understand. The epidemiologists hear instead that physicists do not know of a mechanism by which the radiation might cause cancer. The epidemiologists explain away their great discovery that cell phones protect against cancer and suspect that they may cause brain cancer because they believe the first has no mechanism and the second may have an unknown one. I argue strongly that there is no possible mechanism, known or unknown, by which cell phone radiation might cause cancer. However, the epidemiologists are wrong that there is no way by which cell phones might reduce the risk of brain cancer. Here is my proposal. When our brains absorb energy from cell phones, there is a small temperature increase. When our bodies wish to energize our defense systems and to discomfit the bad guys, the immune system raises the temperature. If the problem is local, the innate immune system produces inflammation. If the problem is general, the innate immune system produces fever. Evidently, a slight, but noticeable temperature increase is beneficial to us.

He turned off the power, unscrewed the bulb, smashed it with a hammer, and only ate the glass.

Dr Harriet Hall, MD is a retired family physician and Air Force Colonel living in Puyallup, Washington. She writes about alternative medicine, pseudoscience, quackery, and critical thinking. She is a contributing editor to both Skeptic and Skeptical Inquirer, an advisor to the [Quackwatch](http://www.quackwatch.org/) website, and an editor of [ScienceBasedMedicine.org](http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/), where she writes an article every Tuesday.

Her website is [www.skepdoc.info](http://www.skepdoc.info/). Science in the Spirit of Mythbusters by Harriet Hall, M.D., the Skepdoc We skeptics spend a lot of time critiquing non-science and too little time promoting science itself. Science is awe-inspiring and fun, and any effort to communicate that to our children is worthwhile. A new book by Sean Connolly, [The Book of Potentially Catastrophic Science: 50 Experiments for Daring Young Scientists](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0761156879?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0761156879), serves that goal well. Connolly makes science sound like a great adventure: he explains how \"mad\" scientists have carried out potentially catastrophic experiments like jumping out of a balloon with only a few yards of silk to slow down the fall. Brave scientific pioneers stuck their necks out to make breakthrough discoveries that have vastly improved our lives and our understanding of how the world works. He describes 34 of the greatest scientific breakthroughs, from stone age tools through Galileo, Newton, Jenner, Darwin, and Curie to the Large Hadron Collider. He tells their stories in an accessible, entertaining style, and he explains the scientific principles in simple terms illustrated by compelling examples. The book is intended for children ages 9 and up, but even adult scientists might enjoy reading it and might even learn a thing or two. The best part is the experiments: 50 of them that kids can do at home to illustrate those principles. He makes them more exciting by rating them from one to four on a Catastrophic Meter Chart, with one representing \"no risk of catastrophe\" and four representing \"high risk: involves use of fire, lot liquids, or hazardous substances. Adult supervision required.\" Some of them are delightfully messy, like creating avalanches with sugar and flour, spilling water, and counting how many popcorn kernels pop out of an open pan per unit of time to demonstrate what radioactive half-life means. You can extract DNA in a kitchen experiment. You can measure the speed of light by melting marshmallows in the microwave oven. You can create a fossil. You can send a toy soldier aloft in a hot air trash bag balloon. You can build a soda bottle rocket. You can shock your tongue with a battery you make yourself from a stack of nickels and pennies. Young fans of the Mythbusters should particularly love this book. Doing their own experiments is a step up from watching them on TV, and it might even be the first step towards a career in science.

R.I.P. Martin. The following is an interview between Martin Gardner and Michael Shermer that appeared in [Skeptic magazine Vol. 5, No. 2](https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/archives/vol05n02.html) (1997).

This October 21 Martin Gardner turns 83, and as he settles into his writing chair that day, he can reflect back on a life well-lived, knowing that there was little of importance he did not reflect upon (and usually write about). In fact, \"science writer\" is really an unfair description. In other circles Gardner is as well-known for his \"annotated\" series of books as he is for his 25 years as columnist for Scientific American. He annotated no less than Alice, the Snark, the Ancient Mariner, Casey at the Bat, the Innocence of Father Brown, and even the Night Before Christmas. He wrote an autobiographical novel ( [The Flight of Peter Fromm](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0879759119?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0879759119)), a book of short stories ( [The No-Sided Professor](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0879753900?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0879753900)), and histories of Mary Baker Eddy and Urantia, the \"Great Cult Mystery.\" His mathematical games column was republished in numerous books, and he dabbled enough in magic to pen several works, including The Encyclopedia of Impromptu Magic. The best single-volume collection of Gardner's works to date, spanning 1938-1995, is [The Night is Large](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312169493?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0312169493) from St. Martin's Press. Born in 1914 (he is a firstborn with a younger brother and sister), Gardner served in the Second World War on a destroyer escort in the Atlantic. During those four years, Gardner honed his writing skills editing a weekly newspaper called The Badger Navy News. For his final two years, however, he saw action in the \"Killer Group,\" who looked for German U-boats to sink. Gardner attended the University of Chicago \"in the Adler-Hutchins heyday.\" In high school, he explained, he wanted to be a physicist and go to Caltech, \"but they didn't take students until you had two years of general education. So I went to the University of Chicago because Hutchins had just become president and they had a new program that appealed to me where you had complete freedom to go at your own speed. If you passed a test in a course you didn't have to take the course. It was noncompulsory class attendance. Nobody checked to see if you attended and I think I audited more courses than I actually signed up for.\" In his third year Gardner decided to major in philosophy. \"The philosophy department had been crippled when Hutchins brought in Adler from Columbia University and put him in philosophy without getting the permission of the dean of the department, resulting in a big walkout of philosophers.\" Hutchins withdrew Adler from the department and put him in the Law School. \"Those were the days when Adler was practically a Roman Catholic. I have a very rare document that is a typed copy of a speech he gave about a year after he came to Chicago in which he defended the Catholic Church as the one true religion, and there is a passage in which, believe it or not, he defends the right of the church to burn heretics. That was a younger Adler. He is very much ashamed of this speech.\" Following his undergraduate training, Gardner took a year of graduate work at Chicago but then decided he didn't want to teach and instead became a fulltime writer. \"Then the war came, but after the war I took another year of graduate work under the G.I. bill and this is when I took this course that Rudolf Carnap gave on the philosophy of science. This is when I really got interested in science.\" Where does Gardner get his drive and intellectual curiosity? He was raised in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where Gardner's father earned a doctorate in geology, specializing in limestone caverns (even publishing several technical papers on the subject). \"He ended up in petroleum geology when the oil business was just starting, and that is how we ended up in Tulsa.\" One of the last of the wildcatters, the senior Gardner had his own company that consisted only of himself and a secretary. He would do his own geological exploration until he found what looked like a dome with oil in it, then would hire a drilling company to drill it for him. \"His company was up and down. Most of the time nothing happened but when he got a big hit it paid for the losses.\" Not all of Gardner's books have been big hits (it is hard to be popular when skewering sacred cows), but the ones he has had have more than paid for the losses, as he explained to Skeptic. Skeptic: You are a prolific writer. How do you do it? Do you have a daily schedule you stick to? Do you try to write six hours a day, or 10 pages a day? Gardner: No, it is a very flexible schedule. Since I don't have a job I have a lot of free time. My working time is as much time as I can grab from other things I have to do. If a person doesn't have a job, and isn't teaching, it isn't surprising to be able to write a lot of books. In fact, I marvel at the people who write as much as they do and at the same time hold down a teaching position. Skeptic: You are one of the founders of the modern skeptical movement. Is it pretentious of us to call ourselves a movement? Is there such a thing? And what are we, humanists, skeptics, free thinkers? Gardner: Obviously there is a movement although I don't know how much good it is doing. I think the word skeptic is best, although there is a wide variety of beliefs among skeptics. William Jarvis [Director of the National Council Against Health Fraud], for example, is a Seventh-day Adventist. Skeptic: In the skeptical movement we worry about how \"bad\" things are with regard to weird beliefs. If you compare things to 500 years ago with regard to superstitions and irrationalities, it is much better. But within our time, how bad do you think it is? Are things better now than they were in, say, the 1980s? Gardner: I really don't know how to answer that. In some ways we have made tremendous progress and in other ways we have gone the opposite direction. There are more people who believe in astrology now than in the 19th century. If you go back 100 years it would be hard to find a newspaper with an astrology column, and now it is hard to find one without one! Skeptic: What can we do? Or, perhaps I should say, what more can we do? Gardner: I don't know that we can do more than what we are already doing in the skeptical magazines like Skeptic and Skeptical Inquirer, and books like Carl Sagan's [Demon Haunted World](https://www.skeptic.com/productlink/b045PB). We just need to do more of that. Skeptic: Inevitably skepticism leads to asking the God question. You call yourself a fideist. Gardner: I call myself a philosophical theist, or sometimes a fideist, who believes something on the basis of emotional reasons rather than intellectual reasons. Skeptic: This will surely strike readers as something of a paradox for a man who is so skeptical about so many things. Gardner: People think that if you don't believe Uri Geller can bend spoons then you must be an atheist. But I think these are two different things. I call myself a philosophical theist in the tradition of Kant, Charles Peirce, William James, and especially Miguel Unamuno, one of my favorite philosophers. As a fideist I don't think there are any arguments that prove the existence of God or the immortality of the soul. Even more than that, I agree with Unamuno that the atheists have the better arguments. So it is a case of quixotic emotional belief that is really against the evidence and against the odds. The classic essay in defense of fideism is William James' The Will to Believe. James' argument, in essence, is that if you have strong emotional reasons for a metaphysical belief, and it is not strongly contradicted by science or logical reasons, then you have a right to make a leap of faith if it provides sufficient satisfaction. It makes the atheists furious when you take this position because they can no more argue with you than they can argue over whether you like the taste of beer or not. To me it is entirely an emotional thing. Skeptic: Couldn't someone make this same argument for belief in New Age hokum? Couldn't they quote you in support of their beliefs? Gardner: They could use that argument, except New Agers also have a whole series of beliefs that can be empirically refuted. Like reincarnation \u2014 the evidence against that is overwhelming. Most New Agers also accept most of the beliefs of the parapsychologists. They believe in ESP and PK and channeling. We have very strong empirical evidence against these beliefs. So I think there is a big difference between belief in God and belief in the paranormal. William James made this clear in The Will to Believe. In the first place, it has to be a leap of faith about something that has overwhelming importance to an individual. Second, it has to be something for which there isn't any strong empirical evidence or logical argument against it. So there is something radically different about belief in a mind behind the universe and the whole cluster of beliefs that the New Age movement presents. Skeptic: So in your earlier statement that the atheists' arguments are better than the theists' arguments, you must mean only slightly better. Gardner: Well, they are better in the sense that the theist has a tremendous problem of explaining the existence of evil, and to me that is the strongest argument against God. If there is a God and he is all powerful and all good, why does he allow evil into the world? Evil exists, so is God all good but not all powerful? Or is he all powerful but not all good? That is a very powerful argument and I don't know of any good way to answer it. Skeptic: What about life after death? Gardner: If you believe in God at all, I think you have to believe in a personal God, in a sense. That is, you have to assign to God something analogous to human mind because that is the highest type mind we are acquainted with. If God is just another name for nature then I think it is more honest just to say we are humanists. Skeptic: So your God is not Spinoza's God. Gardner: That's right. I regard Spinoza as essentially an atheist, because to him God and Nature were synonymous. In his writings you could replace the term \"God\" with the term \"Nature\" and it doesn't change anything. Skeptic: That's not what most people mean by \"God.\" Gardner: No, and of course if you do believe in a personal God it is in an analogical sense, so I sometimes like to call myself a theological positivist because I agree completely with Carnap that metaphysical questions are meaningless \u2014 if you can't get at it by logic or by science you really can't say anything at all about the question. If you ask me for details about the nature of God I would have to answer \"I don't know.\" The kind of God I believe in is so completely transcendent and so wholly Other that you really can't say anything about God's nature. To ask, for example, whether God is inside or outside of time, I have no idea what this means or how to reply to it. I can understand arguments saying he is in time, coming from the process theologians; on the other hand I can understand the arguments that place God completely outside of time, in some sort of realm in which time has no meaning. But these are metaphysical arguments and Carnap would say they are meaningless questions, and I would agree to that. Skeptic: You don't pray, do you? Gardner: I do. Skeptic: You do? Every day? Gardner: No, not every day. But I think if you believe there is a creator with a mind somewhat analogous to the human mind, the impulse to pray is pretty overwhelming. Obviously you don't ask to change the weather or help the football team to win. But I think if you believe in God at all you have an impulse to worship in the sense of offering thanks and asking for forgiveness. Skeptic: Your wife? Gardner: My wife is Jewish. We are a mixed marriage. She has a Jewish background and I have a Methodist background, but we both ended up outside of any particular church tradition. I don't go to church, and neither does she. Skeptic: What about the Unitarians? Gardner: I could be a Unitarian except the Unitarian church has turned out to be essentially a secular humanist church. Most Unitarian ministers are atheists. I have no desire to get up on Sunday to go hear a lecture on ethics, especially if the minister is not particularly bright. Skeptic: So you would not call yourself a humanist or secular humanist. Gardner: No, I would not. Paul Kurtz wanted to give me a secular humanist award once and I turned it down on the grounds that I don't consider myself a secular humanist. Skeptic: What about immortality? Gardner: I think if you believe in a personal God you have a right to hope for it. But it is more a hope than anything else. There is certainly no empirical evidence for life after death, and no rational argument for it. Again, the atheists have all the best arguments because obviously our mind is dependent on a physical brain, and if the brain is destroyed then how could we live again? Skeptic: Couldn't you take your emotional leap here? Gardner: I don't think you can believe in a personal God without believing in the possibility of immortality. Skeptic: In other words, if you are going to make one leap you can make both leaps. Gardner: Yes, because God would be a very peculiar God if he did not allow for some kind of justice in the universe. If there is no life after death there isn't any justice. The hoped-for life after death is very much tied into a personal God. Kant believed in immortality and defended it on what I would call pragmatic grounds. He denied that there are any rational arguments for believing in either God or immortality, but he defended them on the grounds that it is the only way to turn the universe into a moral universe. It was essentially a fideist argument. William James wrote a whole book about this, and Peirce, Unamuno, and plenty of philosophers in the distant past going all the way back to Plato believed in immortality. Skeptic: Are your ethics and morals driven by fideism? With fideism, you don't need natural ethics or evolutionary ethics, right? Gardner: Actually I do think that ethics can rest on a naturalistic basis. And I defend that in my book [The Whys of a Philosophical Scrivener](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312206828?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0312206828). My views on ethics are the same as John Dewey's. If you grant that there is a human nature that is common to all individuals \u2014 and I believe there is a common human nature, I don't believe in cultural or moral relativism \u2014 then individuals have certain basic needs and you can judge a society and a moral system by the degree to which it maximizes or satisfies those needs. So I don't think you need to inject God into that process at all. Skeptic: Some of these ethical issues seem irresolvable on a natural basis. Like abortion. How do you come down one side or the other using science or reason, without calling on something higher, like \"rights,\" which is itself a metaphysical concept? Gardner: There are questions in ethics for which it is very, very difficult to decide what the answer should be. I believe in what is called emotive ethics. If you build up a naturalistic ethics you have to base it on a set of axioms, but you can't defend the axioms except on an emotional basis. For example, one of the axioms that lie at the heart of naturalistic ethics is the notion that it is better to be alive than dead. There is no logical basis for it and you can't defend it empirically. If a person says \"I think it is better to be dead than alive,\" it is very difficult to talk him out of it. Skeptic: Couldn't you make an evolutionary argument here \u2014 that it is in our genes to make us want to be alive instead of dead, in order to propagate the genes. Gardner: Yes, or to take another axiom, it is better to be healthy than sick. You have to have these axioms in order to derive a naturalistic ethics. Skeptic: Could you use this same line of reasoning for political systems? Could you argue, for example, that all people seek greater happiness and then prove scientifically that this political system is better than that political system, but if you ask people they will say this or that, and that is what democracy is all about, right? You are essentially asking people, in an emotive way, which system they like best. Gardner: The empirical system comes in, in a sense, because you can ask whether this society meets human needs better or worse than that society. So you can make value judgments across lines. But the value judgments have to rest finally on a set of emotional posits. I do think you can compare cultures and say that Culture A is superior to Culture B in meeting the needs of its people. And you can also say that certain culture practices are bad or good. For example, there are tens of thousands of African women whose genitals are mutilated. I think you are justified in saying that it is a bad practice and should be abolished. Skeptic: In [Skeptic Vol. 4, No. 2](https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/archives/vol04n02.html) I used that same example in my essay on evolutionary ethics. But in a conversation with Carol Tavris, when I suggested that by asking these women how they feel about it we could derive an ethical principle that it is wrong, she pointed out that many of them would probably approve of the mutilation because that is what their culture dictates. So aren't we just imposing our values on someone else? How do we derive an ethical principle that genital mutilation is an immoral act without resorting to some metaphysical argument? Gardner: I guess ultimately you have to justify it by whether a culture has good survival ability or not. This is a problem since some of the women actually want to go through the mutilation process. A cultural anthropologist would probably defend the practice on the grounds that within those cultures it serves its purpose. On that grounds, however, you could make the same argument about the Holocaust \u2014 the Nazis believed it was a good thing to exterminate the Jews. Skeptic: Couldn't a pro-life/anti-abortionist make the argument that it is better for a fetus to be alive than dead, since it is at least a potential human? How would you respond to that argument? Gardner: I don't know how to respond to it because we are getting into ethical questions for which there really are no solid rules. I don't think there is an identity independent of the brain. I don't think the brain of an embryo is developed well enough to call it a human person. But it is a tough argument because it is on a continuum and there is no right place to draw the line. Skeptic: Frank Tipler makes a similar argument for immortality: that personal identity is linked to the brain, and the brain is nothing more than information processing. Tipler foresees a day in the far future of the universe when brains could be duplicated in computers. Gardner: He is assuming that computers could replicate a perfect human being. I grant that this is possible, maybe in the far future. But I agree with Penrose that it would have to be a type of computer we don't know how to build yet. Since that is in the far future, I don't have an opinion on it. But you can defend immortality on the grounds that everything that constitutes our selves or our identity is a mathematical pattern. If superstring theory turns out to be true then you can ask what are superstrings made up of, and they aren't made of anything! If all matter is pure mathematics, then you can imagine that an all powerful deity who knew the pattern could reconstruct you. So that is similar to what Tipler is saying, in a sense. Skeptic: I wonder, then, if this shouldn't be called protoscience, rather than pseudoscience? Like cryonics. It is not impossible. There are no laws of nature that we know of that prevent it from happening. It is just not verifiable at this point. It is fairly unlikely, but not completely unlikely. Gardner: I would go along with that. Skeptic: What the cryonicists are saying is that once you are cremated your pattern is gone, but if you are frozen there is at least some hope of revising or reconstructing the pattern. They are actually quite pro-science. They argue that you can look at how far science and technology have come in the last century and imagine what it will be able to accomplish in the next 10 or 100 centuries. Gardner: That seems reasonable although I think we are a long way from understanding enough science to accomplish this. And when it comes to human behavior, while there are some uses of science in fields like economics and psychology, there is the problem of human free will that makes prediction extremely difficult. On this question of free will, as a member of a group called the mysterians I believe that we have no idea whether free will exists or how it works. Skeptic: You don't believe free will is at the quantum level, like some physicists do? Gardner: It doesn't help you if it is at the quantum level. That just makes it a random event, as if there is some kind of a roulette wheel in the brain. That doesn't give you a choice. There are certain things I regard as ultimate mysteries. Free will is one of those. Another is time. I don't think we have the slightest idea of what time is. You can't define time without introducing time into the definition, so you just have to accept it as given. The same thing is true with space. Time and space are ultimate mysteries. Free will is bound up in the mysteries of time about which we can never understand, at least at this stage of our evolutionary history. I think it is quite possible that a million years from now there will be creatures on the earth that will be as far beyond us in understanding some of these mysteries as we are beyond the mind of a chimpanzee. Skeptic: Here you are being rather un-Gouldian. Gould sees contingency entering rather strongly into the system so that there is no real progress toward this far future humanoid creature you envision. Gardner: I don't agree with Gould that there is no progress in evolution. I can't understand how he can say that. It is so obvious that the human mind is far more advanced and complicated than anything else. If you look at the history of evolution there is a steady progression of complexity in the nervous system and there is no reason to think that this will not continue since it has been increasing for millions of years. To suppose that this is just sort of an accident, and that evolution could just as easily take a turn the other way toward less complexity, just doesn't seem right to me. Skeptic: Tell me about this mysterian group. Gardner: The mysterians are not an organized group or anything. We don't hold meetings. Mysterians believe that at this point in our evolutionary history there are mysteries that cannot be resolved, like free will. Noam Chomsky, for example, is a mysterian. He is on record saying that we don't have the mental capacity to understand the nature of free will. John Searle is a mysterian. But the leading figure is a philosopher named Colin McGinn. He's written a whole book about this. Skeptic: Why not just leave the whole question of God and immortality as one of these mysterian mysteries? Gardner: Well, sure, if a person wants to be an agnostic and leave it at that I have no objections. It is just that some people are so constituted that a desire to believe in an ultimate meaning in the universe which you can supply only by a leap of faith is so overwhelming that they cannot not make the leap. I'm one of those individuals. Skeptic: What are your politics? Gardner: I call myself a democratic socialist because I believe that government controls are necessary. You have to have a government that is making certain plans to prevent chaos and to maximize the happiness of the citizens. It seems to me that if you want genuine competition you have to prevent monopolies from taking over, and you can't do that without a government. So when I call myself a democratic socialist I'm assuming America is already a democratic socialist society. Actually, a lot of conservative economists say that. Milton Friedman, in his book Free to Choose, calls America democratic socialist. He wants to reverse that and go back to the days of Herbert Hoover and to the days of less government controls. But as I argue in The Whys of a Philosophical Scrivener, there may not even be a best government system. There may be different systems that are equally good at satisfying the needs of the people. Skeptic: You are not a cultural relativist so you are not saying that all political systems are equal, are you? Gardner: No, they are not all equal. But it is quite possible that there are equal alternatives in ways of governing a society that are equally good. Democracy has the problem of what type of voting system best reflects the will of the people. There are all kinds of competing systems and it is very hard to decide whether one is better than another. And they all have imperfections. Skeptic: Give us your thoughts on some specific claims: JFK conspiracy. Gardner: Lone assassin \u2014 Oswald acted alone. Most of the conspiracy theories are very unrealistic in terms of the opportunity and motives of the so-called conspirators. Castro, maybe, had a motive with the Bay of Pigs incident and all that, but there is no evidence that he was involved. Skeptic: Hypnosis \u2014 altered state or just fantasy role playing? Gardner: I'm really open-minded about that. For years I assumed that it was an altered state. The problem is that there isn't any test you can make that will show a person is in a trance state. I'm open to the theory that there are individuals who are strongly suggestible and just want to do whatever the hypnotist wants them to do, and thus it is really not an altered state of consciousness at all. I know that the stage hypnotists have a tricky way of filtering out the people who are uncooperative, such as seeing if they can pull their hands apart. So they end up not so much with individuals who are capable of going into an altered state, but with with individuals who want to do whatever the hypnotist tells them. Skeptic: So, hypnosis can't pass the Popperian test of falsifiability? Is it doomed to one of your mysterian mysteries? Gardner: No, I think it might be eventually decided one way or the other. Those who claim it is a trance point to such things as sticking a needle through a person's arm, but that's not very definitive because there is not that much pain in sticking a needle through your arm. I can imagine someone just not wincing. Same thing with post-hypnotic suggestions. Perhaps they so want to please the hypnotist that when he gives the cue they just do what they are suppose to do. Skeptic: Can something be a science if it is not falsifiable? Do you go with the strict Popperian falsifiable criteria? Gardner: No, I think there are two sides to confirmation. One side is finding positive evidence and the other is finding negative evidence. I think Popper made the mistake of emphasizing one over the other. For every scientific conjecture you can make there is the opposite conjecture. So if you falsify one conjecture you are really confirming the opposite. Suppose someone conjectures that there is life on Mars. Most scientists would agree that if we go to Mars and find life, we have confirmed the statement \"there is life on Mars.\" Popper would want to say \"no, you have simply falsified the statement 'there is no life on Mars'.\" I don't see any difference. Every scientific conjecture can be either confirmed or falsified. I'm on Carnap's side here. He debated Popper on this issue of the role of induction. I think Popper was extremely jealous of Carnap's higher reputation at the time and wanted to find something on which to differ strongly from Carnap. I don't think falsification is as important as he made it. Skeptic: Are first-principle statements like \"it is better to be alive than dead\" verifiable or falsifiable? Are these philosophical or scientific statements? Gardner: I don't think these are scientific statements. To say it is better to be alive than dead is what Kant called an \"ought statement.\" And I don't think science can make statements about the way things ought to be. Skeptic: Is all economic theory philosophy then? Gardner: The underlying assumptions are not scientific. But once you've made those assumptions, you can go in and use empirical methods to find out to what extent the assumptions are true. Take the statement \"it is better not to die of starvation.\" It is a scientific process to investigate a culture to see whether it is allowing people to starve or not. Skeptic: Race and IQ. What do you think intelligence is? Gardner: Oh, gosh, I don't know. I agree with Minsky and those who say it is not one single thing but many components. Whether there is something called intelligence that overrides all these different aspects, I really don't know. Skeptic: What about genius? Gardner: I think the kind of creativity that someone like Einstein had is not very well understood, but I wouldn't say it cannot be understood. Every time someone writes a book on creativity I read it and I'm always impressed by how little they have to say about what happens in a person's mind. I think it will be a long, long time before a computer can be genuinely creative in a way that Einstein was in his relativity theory. The current checkers champion is a computer. And now the best chess player seems to be a computer. But these games are little more than sophisticated tic-tac-toe games. These computers no more \"know\" they are playing checkers or chess than your lawn mower \"knows\" it is mowing your lawn. The creative process is something entirely different. Skeptic: What goes on in your creative mind when you are doing these clever mathematical games? Gardner: I'm not a creative mathematician in any sense. Oh, I've invented a few puzzles but they are very low level math. I get the journals and read what the real mathematicians write about. Of course, this is the secret to the success of my column. By not knowing much mathematics it was hard for me to understand what I was writing about so I had to learn how to explain it so the general reader could understand it. Skeptic: What are your thoughts on a potential unified theory of everything? Gardner: Superstrings may turn out to unify basic laws of nature, such as gravity and electromagnetism. But it will leave open all kinds of questions that will lead to new conjectures. We do not have the foggiest notion of what they will be like. Penrose is now working on twister theory, which is sort of a rival to superstring theory. If that turns out to be right there will be a real paradigm shift. It is a theory of geometry that underlies the particle theory and quantum mechanics. Skeptic: What about chaos theory? Gardner: It is fashionable and interesting, but I think it is mostly fractal geometry. I think it is more of a temporary fad like catastrophe theory. Skeptic: But Gell-Mann and his colleagues at the Santa Fe Institute are doing a lot more than fractal geometry. They are using computers to model economic and historical systems. Gardner: I've not followed what they are doing all that closely, but Gell-Mann is someone who puzzles me. He believes in the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, which I think is completely insane. And most physicists think it is insane as well. I can't think of any theory that violates Occum's razor more than the many-worlds interpretation. I know it eliminates many of the paradoxes of quantum mechanics, but it does so by bringing in billions and billions of worlds that are branching off from each other and I don't know how anyone can take that seriously. Skeptic: You've had a few things to say about Hillary Clinton and her foray into the New Age. Gardner: I have a big file on Jean Huston and her husband Robert Masters, who is a psychologist. They have been doing experiments for decades on people, where they put them into trances, hypnotic states, etc., then test them for their psychic abilities. Allegedly they are more psychic in these states. I suspect Hillary didn't know about this. Huston and her husband collaborated on a book called Mind Games. These are games for raising your potential, and one of the games is talking to someone you admire. As far as I know this is all she did with Hillary. Skeptic: The Sokal hoax (\"Deconstructing Gravity\"). Gardner: Beautiful. Skeptic: Did he go too far? Isn't there some room for the study of the social construction of science? Science is, after all, conducted by humans firmly embedded in a culture. Gardner: Yes, but I think everyone knows that science is influenced by culture and that society often dictates the sorts of questions scientists try to answer. Every working scientist knows this. It is so obvious as to be trivial. An editorial in the New York Times likened science to the rules in baseball. Well, of course the rules of baseball are socially constructed, but to liken this to science is utterly preposterous. Science is a process of discovering rules that are part of an external world and that can be verified. Skeptic: That is a powerful statement with which to close this interview. Thank you very much for your insights. OUR NEXT LECTURER: paleontologist John Long [Death, Sex & Evolution](https://www.skeptic.com/upcoming-lectures/death-sex-and-evolution/) Sunday, June 13, 2010 at 2 pm Baxter Lecture Hall, Caltech IN THIS RIVETING STORY about his remarkable discoveries from the Gogo fossil site in the Kimberly district of Western Australia, the Australian paleontologist John Long, now Vice President of Research and Collections at the Natural History Museum of L.A. County, takes us beyond just reconstructing animal morphology and into the realm of restoring ancient behavior. Long drills down deep on how we know what we know about the past, what the boundaries of knowledge are with respect to studying fossils, and how exceptional fossils contribute to reshaping our perspectives on evolution. [READ more about this lecture...](https://www.skeptic.com/upcoming-lectures/death-sex-and-evolution/) In response to [last week's feature article](https://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/10-05-19/#feature) in eSkeptic, author Frank S. Robinson responds to Victoria Bekiempis' review of his book [The Case for Rational Optimism](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1412810132?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1412810132). Frank Robinson responds to Victoria Bekiempis IT IS CUSTOMARY FOR REVIEWERS to review an entire book. Ms. Bekiempis has reviewed perhaps a fifth of The Case for Rational Optimism and seems not to have even read most of it. She dwells almost exclusively upon a few observations concerning the human condition (and her repeated, distortive accusations of sexism); there's no clue that the book even covers such subjects as the role of science and technology; why we often fear the wrong things; the whole problem of government and politics; individualism and society; America's economic condition; its global role; race relations; capitalism and corporations; globalization, trade, growth and world poverty; worldwide prospects for democracy; war and peace; the clash with radical Islam; the environment, sustainability, and global warming; modernity and social change; and the nature and meaning of progress. That's the bulk of the book. Not only does Bekiempis disregard all this, she actually implies that I do too - in her mouthing the tired pessimist trope - \"there are many more reasons for such pessimism: cancer, rape, genocide, famine, etc.\" To falsely suggest that my book fails to grapple with such things is simply outrageous. As for the small part of it she did review, Bekiempis tries to make me sound like a purveyor of sappy banalities. Easy to do if you just take a few quotes out of context and forget the substance of the extended arguments in which they are embedded. Or, rather, make up the quotes. Bekiempis's \"It is what it is, cool!\" and \"Let's make the best of this!\" (notwithstanding her quote marks) are not quotes from the book, and caricature what it actually argues. Flinging the epithet \"existentialism light,\" she says, \"emotional unrest is not easily quelled.\" In fact, I said (page 43), \"There can be no completely satisfying answer\" to the main problem of death. Yet there are ways we can live rewarding lives and escape the trap of nihilistic existential despair. Bekiempis seems comfortable residing there, hence unwilling to deal seriously with any contrary arguments. (Curiously enough, two of the comments posted about the review point to the work of Viktor Frankl and Daniel Gilbert as bearing on the these issues. In fact, my book discusses both.) Bekiempis quotes my observation that our discomfort over \"wickedness prosper[ing] while the good suffer\" is indicative that we're fundamentally moral beings. This, she says, \"is not a proper rejoinder to evil.\" It was, manifestly, not intended to be. Then she goes on to attack my actual point, saying that, \"To claim that our dismay about evil is proof of inherent good requires more work, which Robinson does not do.\" No? In fact, the \"wickedness\" point is merely one small observation within two full chapters examining in depth the evolutionary, sociological, psychological, and rational bases for human morality, with plenty of factual evidence from biology, anthropology and neuroscience discussed, as well as the work of major philosophers on the subject. Bekiempis may disagree with that analysis, but to say I didn't even perform it is impermissible. Perhaps her animus against the book comes from a gigantic feminist chip on her shoulder. Any fair reading of the entire book would see its repeated emphasis on the importance and value of women's empowerment. For example, on page 298: \"the liberation of women has improved society, not just for women, but for everyone.\" Yet Bekiempis accuses me of \"sexism\" by putting a tortured spin on a few quotes. Like the Onassis quote \u2014 Biekempis casts me as saying \"we'd be happier if we understood our drive for bling and power.\" No. I said we should understand that aspect of human nature, but argued \u2014 at some length \u2014 that we'd be happier if we behaved differently! Her point invoking domestic violence is incomprehensible \u2014 surely the quoted one-liner in my book says it's a very bad thing that women shouldn't accept. Then there's my observation (re inequality) that \"many single moms will marry.\" Bekiempis says, \"Call me crazy, but it seems like Robinson is suggesting that a single mom's route out of poverty is marriage.\" Well, it's one route, surely; on average married mothers are in better economic shape than single ones. Is marriage something bad for women, that Bekiempis opposes? I'll let readers judge whether to call her crazy.

Robinson's book [The Case for Rational Optimism](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1412810132?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1412810132). You say to yourself: \"How curious and fortuitous! Here's a book on why life is generally good ... and right when I need it most!\" So you start reading, and you keep reading, and you find that your new hope in optimism starts to wane. Not because Robinson advocates anything silly like a glib, Pangloss-like approach to existence. Robinson would have actually been doing us a favor had he done that. Instead, Robinson makes us endure some 300 pages of fallacy and clich\u00e9-laden prose \u2014 with the occasional sprinkling of sexism. So let's begin with the beginning. Robinson's thesis seems innocuous enough: life has its highs and lows, but it's generally good. All facts considered, we should have a positive outlook on ourselves and the world. And we should put \"individuals and their flourishing first and foremost.\" Overall, \"we are headed in the right direction.\" This is banal enough. It's when Robinson leaves some hard-to-answer big questions unanswered, then uses rhetorical questions to solidify his thesis, that his book begins to unravel. One example: after a rather simplified rundown of evolution, Robinson offers the reader a description of the human condition that can be described as \"existentialism light\" \u2014 ultimate freedom meets self help. Lack of cosmic freedom, he writes, does not translate into nihilism. \"Our ultimate freedom to create our own meaning is no less beautiful and awesome. You are the center of your own universe,\" he writes. Robinson then asks, \"well, is the meaning we create worthwhile and worth living for?\" His answer is troublesome: \"All of us are together on this little lifeboat of a planet, striving to make the best of the human condition. What more purpose could we need?\" As beautiful as this sounds, it remains problematic in a few senses. First, it seems to assume that human-condition pessimists maintain such a mindset because they're troubled by meaninglessness. There are many more reasons for such pessimism: cancer, rape, genocide, famine, etc. Second, it seems to neglect why philosophers have argued about the human condition for millennia \u2014 it's something we examine, not just pass off as, \"It is what it is, cool!\" We agonize over what causes us agony, and that's why emotional unrest is not easily quelled. I don't know whether a philosophic \"Let's make the best of this!\" can mollify pessimists who remain troubled about a dearth of cosmic meaning. And it's unclear whether even the presence of meaning would resolve pessimists' very real human-condition concerns. Another big flaw that occurs throughout the book is Robinson's assumptions about longstanding philosophical dilemmas. Take evil \u2014 specifically, whether the presence of evil postulates certain qualities about the human condition. Robinson writes: \"One of our most obsessive questions is why too often in this world wickedness prospers while the good suffer. Why does this torment us so? It is because we are, again, fundamentally moral beings.\" Any reader's opinion on optimism (mine included) notwithstanding, this does not seem like a proper rejoinder to evil, let alone evidence that human nature makes us more good than bad. Consider: Robinson is essentially trying to ascertain cause from effect. In this case, he has extrapolated a cause of \"inherent human good\" from \"unrest toward evil.\" For the sake of mere argument, it is possible that humans might be troubled by evil because of what evil often equates to: property loss, physical damage, societal instability. Evil, at one very basic level, is a pain in terms of day-to-day life. To claim that our dismay about evil is proof of inherent good requires more work, which Robinson does not do. These issues, moreover, are not isolated incidents \u2014 they occur within the beginnings of Robinson's writing and set the premise for many of his later arguments, making them particularly troubling snags. But troubles with Robinson's premises aren't all that irked me. I'm also a bit peeved by his portrayal of women. Apparently, our genes (bless them!) make us money-grubbing social climbers. \"Women are wired to seek mates with high status, because that's an indicator of good genes their children will inherit,\" he writes. Robinson then quotes Aristotle Onassis' charming quip on the female disposition, that if \"women didn't exist, all the money in the world would have no meaning.\" In all fairness, Robinson wasn't saying that women had to act this way. Rather, he said that we'd be happier if we understood our drive toward bling and power. Still, the whole exchange smells a little 1950s. I'm also wary of any analogy that uses domestic violence to prove a point. Robinson compares people's veneration of flawed governments to \"battered wives who still profess undying love for their abusers.\" As well, I was a bit disturbed by a statement he made about single mothers and poverty. Arguing that inequality is temporary among demographics, Robinson writes: \"There are many causes: being a student or single mother, illness or disability, divorce, job loss, recent immigration. But many single moms will marry, many ill people recover, most students graduate into the workforce, most unemployed find jobs, most immigrants assimilate and prosper.\" Call me crazy, but it seems like Robinson is suggesting that a single mom's route out of poverty is marriage. There's that 1950s eau de toilette again. Of course, Robinson might have a few words to say about this critique. I might be lumped with the pessimists, chastised as a member of, as Robinson describes it, the \"bumper crop of carping crybabies\" that's ruining America. What's important to remember is that none of what I've said about Robinson's book really deals with the merits of its ideological goal, but rather the strength of Robinson's argument on it's own. Unfortunately, it's a weak one. But I'm optimistic that such a good idea as rational optimism won't go too long without a better-suited spokesman.

Meaning-Making Neurons a book review by Dr. Michael Shermer TWICE I HAVE SPOKEN at the [TED (Technology, Entertainment, Design)](http://www.ted.com/) conference. Twice I have begrudgingly agreed to the strictly enforced 18-minute talk format \u2014 grumbling that \"ideas worth spreading\" (the TED motto) could not possibly be conveyed in such a constrained format. And twice have I been proven wrong. With discipline and diligence you really can say something of substance in a tight space, and more than 200 million downloads of endlessly entertaining and educational videos prove the principle of pithiness. In [The Brain and the Meaning of Life](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691142726?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0691142726), philosopher, psychologist, and computer scientist Paul Thagard (University of Waterloo) has elegantly employed the pithiness principle. He offers a tightly reasoned, often humorous, and original contribution to the emerging practice of applying science to areas heretofore the province of philosophers, theologians, ethicists, and politicians: What is reality and how can we know it? Are mind and brain one or two? What is the source of the sense of self? What is love? What is the difference between right and wrong, and how can we know it? What is the most legitimate form of government? What is the meaning of life, and how can we find happiness in it? Thagard employs the latest tools and findings of science in his attempts to answer these (and additional) questions. He briefly reviews how others have addressed them in the past. And he discusses how a scientific worldview can inform one's analysis and in some cases fully answer the questions \u2014 at least to the satisfaction of those of us who take a strictly materialist and naturalist perspective. Yes, there is a point of view here, and well there should be. When Henry Fawcett commented to Charles Darwin that some scientists found Darwin too theoretical and believed that he should just let the facts speak for themselves, Darwin responded: \"How odd it is that anyone should not see that all observation must be for or against some view if it is to be of any service\" (1). Thagard's perspective is that of cognitive neuroscience. He wants to bore into the brain to add a layer of more objective analysis. Take love, as Thagard does in a concise six pages. He notes that when you gaze upon the face of your lover, the ventral tegmental area and the nucleus accumbens \u2014 both rich in dopamine receptors and associated with extremely positive feelings similar to those in cocaine addiction \u2014 become quite active. He remarks how the hormone oxytocin increases feelings of attachment between people. These findings and numerous others that he mentions support his model of emotional consciousness, \"emocon\" (2). That conceptual model sketches how different areas of the brain \"interact to produce emotions as the result of both cognitive appraisal and bodily perception.\" In it, external stimuli (such as the sight of your loved one) are input through the senses (sight, smells, touch) to the thalamus, which in turn stimulates both brain states and bodily states (increased heart rate and blood pressure, rapid breathing and flushed skin, and so forth). A network of mutual interactions among the amygdala, the insula, and various parts of the prefrontal cortex integrates bodily perceptions and cognitive appraisal. Thus, the base emotions from the amygdala (lusty passion) are linked to the higher cognitive functions of the cerebral cortex (assessment of the relationship). How does all this get coordinated into a single feeling that we call love? Our dualistic intuitions tell us that there must be a mind that knows what the brain is doing, or some brain module that coordinates all processes into a single self, or some sort of central processing homunculus that sits at a neural switchboard. Not so, says Thagard: \"There is no central processor that coordinates all the results and yields a decision. Rather, the brain's reaction to a scary face or other sensory stimulus comes about through the dynamic interaction of external sensory perception, internal sensory perception, cognitive appraisal, and positive and negative valuation.\" But from where does the sense of a single entity arise? Reciprocal feedback systems: \"Note that the connections between brain areas in the ... model are reciprocal, based on neural evidence that there is extensive feedback between neural populations in each pair of regions.\" Whether or not reciprocal feedback systems can properly account for such subjective qualia states as love (or for the \"self \") is highly debatable. Still, Thagard is to be commended for proposing a testable hypothesis and providing evidence in support of it that can be easily accessed by both scientists and general readers. On the subjective feeling of happiness, for example, he cites data gathered by social psychologist Sonja Lyubomirsky on what makes people happy (3). Many things do, among them: expressing gratitude, cultivating optimism, avoiding overthinking and social comparison, practicing acts of kindness, nurturing social relationships, developing strategies for coping, learning to forgive, increasing flow experiences (in which one is absorbed in an activity), savoring life's joys, committing to your goals, practicing religion and spirituality, and taking care of your body through physical activity. Thagard is mildly dismissive of religion and spirituality, but he need not be \u2014 just broaden the category to include any activity that generates a sense of awe and transcendence. (For me, that comes from visiting astronomical observatories, fossil quarries, or geological formations, all of which lead to the contemplation of deep time and the humbling sense of insignificance before the vastness of the cosmos.) Toward the end of The Brain and the Meaning of Life, Thagard dares to employ an objective standard to answer the question \"What kind of government should countries have?\" Because he gives the topic less than three full pages, political scientists will certainly feel that their field has been shortchanged. And while I agree with his conclusion that the current form of government most likely to satisfy human needs is \"a liberal democracy operating in a capitalist economic system,\" I take issue with his subsequent qualification, \"with substantial state support for education, health care, and other egalitarian social requirements.\" Nonetheless, I applaud Thagard's approach of bringing to bear on the question two data sets: the [United Nations Human Development Index](http://hdr.undp.org/en/statistics/) (which rates 177 countries on how well they provide their citizens with \"a long and healthy life, education, and a decent standard of living\") and [yearly surveys, since 1981, of subjective well-being (happiness)](http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/happinesstrends/). Iceland, Canada, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Switzerland appeared near the top in both lists. It is true that two data sets do not a political science make, but Thagard's concluding remarks in this section are a model of scientific caution and skepticism: \"We should also not rule out the possibility that some form of government not currently practiced might actually be better for meeting vital human needs than those now in operation. Perhaps future social experiments will find creative new ways of governing states that will be more effective than those now observed.\" Although we cannot implement such experiments in the name of science, if they do happen, scientists should be the first in to record the results.

Robert Temple is lauded and often cited by the New Age and alternative archaeology movements for his excellent scholarship and broad understanding of mythology and ancient history. In this week's eSkeptic, Jason Colavito explores Temple's use of the Greek myth of Jason's quest for the Golden Fleece to see if it stands up to scrutiny. Jason Colavito holds a degree in both anthropology and journalism and specializes in alternative archaeology, fringe science and revisionist history. He is proudly listed as \"notable practitioner\" of skeptical xenoarchaeology on the Space Archaeology Wiki. He is also the author of a number of books, including [The Cult of Alien Gods: H. P. Lovecraft and Extraterrestrial Pop Culture](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591023521?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1591023521). Golden Fleeced The Misuse of the Argonaut Myth in Robert Temple's Sirius Mystery by Jason Colavito MORE THAN THREE DECADES AFTER PUBLICATION, Robert Temple's [The Sirius Mystery](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/089281750X?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=089281750X) remains an important reference work for the New Age and alternative archaeology movements. Contemporary writers often claim that even if one disagrees with Temple's theories about extraterrestrials, his scholarship in mythology and ancient history is commendable. A review of Temple's use of the myth of Jason and the Argonauts in The Sirius Mystery demonstrates that Temple employs consistently poor scholarship and only superficial research. This analysis therefore concludes that three decades of claims for Temple's superior scholarship and the academic integrity of The Sirius Mystery are unfounded. As we approach the thirty-fifth anniversary of Robert Temple's The Sirius Mystery (1976; revised 1998), it has been fairly well-established that Temple's thesis about extraterrestrial visitation has little basis in fact. Temple had claimed that an African tribe called the Dogon had sophisticated knowledge of the invisible companion to the star Sirius, known to modern astronomers as Sirius B, and that this knowledge derived from amphibious aliens that descended to earth in ancient Sumeria thousands of years ago and were worshipped as gods. Their possession of esoteric knowledge of deep space unknown in the West until the nineteenth century is taken as proof of extraterrestrial contact. Though anthropologists failed to find a genuine Sirius B tradition among the Dogon outside what they had gleaned from recent contact with Europeans [1](#note01), and skeptics refuted Temple's extraterrestrial conclusions, The Sirius Mystery continues to serve as a standard reference work in the New Age and alternative archaeology movements. In the past few years alone, works such as Christopher Penczak's [Ascension Magick](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0738710474?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0738710474) (Llewellyn Worldwide, 2007), R.

Mehler's [The Land of Osiris](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0932813585?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0932813585) (Adventures Unlimited, 2002) utilize Temple's book to a greater or lesser extent to support their alternative and New Age claims. The internet, too, is a hotbed of Temple-derived Sirius theories. And, of course, Temple continues to publish books of alternative archaeology, including most recently [The Sphinx Mystery](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594772711?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1594772711) (with Olivia Temple, Inner Traditions, 2009). Therefore, renewed study of The Sirius Mystery is no moot point but an inquiry into an active and important touchstone for the alternative movement. It is not my intention to review the case against Temple's space-faring fish-men and their watery revelations. Such work has already been done, exhaustively, and, to most skeptics' minds, conclusively [2](#note02). Instead, I would like to explore Robert Temple's misuse of Greek mythology, specifically the myth of Jason and the Argonauts, to refute frequently repeated claims that, even if one doubts his most outrageous conclusions, Temple is \"scholarly, careful, and scientifically honest\" [3](#note03). Temple is frequently described as a \"recognized scholar\" [4](#note04) or even as a \"preeminent scholar of mathematics, astronomy and mythology\" [5](#note05) by proponents of alternative claims, and Temple himself cites his membership in the Royal Astronomical Society [6](#note06) and several classicist organizations to bolster Sirius's claims to scholarship. An examination of the case of Temple v. Jason will demonstrate that claims for Temple's Sirius scholarship are less solid than the case for the alleged aliens themselves. In Sirius, Temple makes a number of claims about Greek mythology in general and the story of Jason in particular, which he sees as a governing myth tying together all the threads of his Sirius mystery. Temple uses Jason's legendary journey as a starting point for his forays into Greek, Egyptian, and Near Eastern mythology, and there is the strong impression that he views Jason's quest for the Golden Fleece as parallel to his own search for the extraterrestrial secrets of the flying space frogs. For him, the Jason story is the one Greek myth most closely related to an esoteric tradition of alien-derived knowledge of the true nature of the binary Sirius star system \u2014 and he even views the Argonauts as the biological ancestors of the Dogon. In order to understand the scaffolding on which Temple builds his mythological claims, let us briefly review Jason's story as it has come down to us. Jason was the son of Aeson, deposed king of Iolcus and rightful heir to the throne held by his usurping uncle Pelias. Pelias promised to restore the kingdom to Jason on condition that Jason bring the Golden Fleece from the kingdom of Colchis back to Iolcus, a quest Pelias is sure will end in Jason's death. Jason therefore assembles fifty companions (originally unnamed but later associated with the greatest Greek heroes) on the ship Argo and sails to Colchis, experiencing many adventures. In Colchis, Jason fails to persuade its king to give him the fleece, and he instead steals it from the dragon that guards it with the help of the king's daughter, the sorceress Medea, on condition that Jason marry her. Jason has many more adventures on the way back to Iolcus, where he presents the fleece and deposes his uncle. He then betrays Medea's love, loses the favor of the gods, and dies when a piece of the dry-docked Argo falls on his head. The Jason story is cited elliptically in Homer (usually dated to c. 8th century BCE), briefly in Hesiod's Theogony (c. 700 BCE), and is most fully developed in Pindar's Fourth Pythian Ode (462 BCE) and Apollonius of Rhodes's Argonautica (c. 245 BCE). Jason also appears in some early Greek and Etruscan art, but, intriguingly, some of these images show a different version of the legend, unrecorded in the surviving poems, in which Jason apparently descends into the dragon's stomach and reemerges, aided by the goddess Athena rather than Medea [7](#note07). Informed scholarly conjecture is that the primal Jason legend dates to Mycenaean times (c. 1500 BCE) and originally featured a voyage to the end of the world (rather than specifically Colchis) to retrieve the fleece via a descent into the guardian dragon's stomach and a triumph over death. It is possible Jason was dismembered and resurrected through Athena's ministrations or his own supernatural healing powers [8](#note08). Medea may be a later addition to the original quest tale, though she must have appeared before 700 BCE, as she is in Hesiod. Such history is not considered in Sirius, despite at least two centuries of scholarly discussion about it. For Temple, the Jason myth is much more than an adventure. His views on Jason are somewhat difficult to follow, scattered as they are through Sirius, but the abridged version runs like this: Jason and the fifty Argonauts represent Sirius A (the main star we see in the sky) and the fifty-year period it takes Sirius B (the hidden companion star) to travel around Sirius A. The Argo, their boat, is the system taken as a whole with its fifty oars representing each year of Sirius B's orbit [9](#note09). In this, the Argonauts are therefore the equivalent of the Annunaki, the fifty anonymous gods of Sumer (remember the Argonauts were originally unnamed), who therefore are also symbols for Sirius B's fifty-year orbit [10](#note10). Jason, whose name Temple believes means \"appeaser,\" is a feckless wimp [11](#note11) who usurped his position in a myth-cycle that originally centered on the epic voyage of Herakles (Hercules) [12](#note12), who in turn is a later remolding of a still-earlier mythological figure, Briareus, one of the hundred-handed, fifty-headed monsters who assaulted Olympus and were imprisoned in Tartarus. Therefore, Temple concludes, Briareus was the original captain of the Argo [13](#note13). Confusingly, and perhaps in partial contradiction, Jason is also identified as a version of the Sumerian hero Gilgamesh, primarily on the basis of both having fifty companions and many adventures [14](#note14). From this framework, Temple then branches out into increasingly fanciful excursions that are beyond the scope of this article. Since Temple's defenders frequently cite his deep scholarship and thorough understanding of mythology and ancient history, it is only fair to ask how scholarly Temple's mythological framework is. We can begin by dispensing with one point easily enough. The \"feckless\" Jason was the creation of Apollonius of Rhodes, who was writing in the Hellenistic period, five or six hundred years after the Homeric age of epic poetry, and a full millennium after the Jason tale may have originated in Mycenaean Greece. Apollonius purposely recast the hero as a vulnerable but brave human in keeping with the tastes and values of the era [15](#note15). Since this is a late development, it can have no bearing on the original myth or its supposed extraterrestrial antecedents. Similarly, I can find no support for Temple's view that Jason's name means \"appeaser,\" as nearly every scholarly source derives his name from the Greek word \"to heal\" [16](#note16). Temple provides no citation beyond his own assertion, and I am unable to determine his reasoning for his claim. These minor points safely dispensed with, we can move on to the meat of Temple's Jason argument. Let us begin by asking on what grounds Temple identifies Jason as Herakles and Herakles as Briareus and/or Gilgamesh. Here, fortunately, Temple has made our job easy. In all these cases, the source of his identifications (and, indeed, it appears the entirety of his knowledge of Greek myth) is Robert Graves's [The Greek Myths](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140171991?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0140171991) (1955), which he explicitly cites. Graves identifies Jason and Herakles thus: \"Jason and Herakles are, in fact, the same character so far as the marriage-task myth is concerned ... Jason was, of course, a title of Herakles\" [17](#note17). Here Graves argues that both stories reflect tasks associated with sacred kingship, and that Herakles at one point bore the title of a Jason (i.e., \"healer,\" a meaning Temple previously rejected). This is not exactly the same as saying that Herakles captained the Argo, and Temple appears to go farther than Graves on this point. Similarly thin is the ground uniting Herakles and Briareus. Graves holds that the Pillars of Herakles were once associated with Briareus and later assigned to Herakles after the Briareus myth \"faded from memory,\" though he does say (without evidence or explanation) that the earliest Herakles was named Briareus [18](#note18). Temple's troubles are compounded when we discover that Graves identifies Herakles directly with Gilgamesh [19](#note19) without the need for Briareus or reference to the Argonauts. Worse, Graves specifically identifies Achilles as another Gilgamesh \"variant,\" and he cites the older myth of Jason's descent into the dragon's stomach (one Temple ignores) as related to the Bible's tale of Jonah and the whale, Jonah being cited as synonymous with Marduk, the Babylonian god! As the reader may have guessed, Graves, who was a poet and novelist rather than an academic, had a particular and penchant for finding fanciful correspondences between mythological characters and for imposing his idiosyncratic views on the Greek myths. Immediately upon publication of The Greek Myths reviewers attacked Graves for his \"defective scholarship\" [20](#note20) for which there was \"no conceivable evidence\" to support his \"inaccuracies, evasions, improbable analogies, and amateur etymologies\" [21](#note21). In short, his scholarship was not to be trusted, and no reputable scholar would use Graves's theories without copious documentary support, which is not to be found in The Sirius Mystery. However, Temple sees Graves as \"invaluable\" and \"superb\" [22](#note22). For Robert Temple to rely on Graves's book not just as a convenient secondary reference for Greek myths but as the foundation for his understanding of mythology and the interrelationship of myths to one another is simply unsupportable. Even when Temple began writing Sirius in 1967, Graves's missteps were well-known; by the time of the 1998 revision of Sirius, continued reliance on these erroneous interpretations was inexcusable. There is a further complication here for Temple's theory. Given the vast period of time over which the Jason myth was told and retold, from the Bronze Age to late versions written under the Roman Empire, it would stand to reason that prehistoric Sirius lore should best be preserved in the oldest versions of and allusions to the myth, those closest in time to the aliens and their teachings. But Temple does not consider this and instead takes Graves's version as \"standard\" (minus the apparently interchangeable heroes). All this on top of the fact that Graves himself warns that older Argonaut stories were nothing like the story from the Hellenistic age! [23](#note23) Other than a superficial swipe at Herakles' and Orpheus' appearance in Apollonius, Temple makes no attempt to separate late interpolations from older traditions, thus presenting every scrap of legend from 1500 BCE to 250 BCE as part of one unified Sirius-Jason complex, as though the myth were unchanged in its details for a thousand years. This would be the equivalent of trying to study early medieval Britain using only Tennyson's [Idylls of the King](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0451528751?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0451528751) (1856-1885) and a rough idea that King Arthur lived in the Dark Ages. Obviously, one cannot claim on the basis of a modern retelling of a late version of a myth that an African tribe is the flesh-and-blood descendants of these mythic heroes. At this point, it should go without saying that any direct relationship between Jason's fifty oarsmen and the \"fifty\" Anunnaki is entirely speculative. While the Anunnaki may occasionally be referred to as fifty in number (though Temple gives no source for this), their numbers vary in myth. The Babylonians, for example, considered them to be three hundred in number [24](#note24). However, to give the devil his due, Gilgamesh did have fifty companions in the earliest versions of his myth (c. 2000 BCE), though these were left out of the later versions of the first and second millenniums BCE, the versions current when the Jason myth was promulgated and eventually recorded. However, as half of one hundred, fifty was an exceedingly common number in mythology, and unless we choose to read all reference to fifty as Sirius lore, there needs to be something more than linguistic convenience to justify such an interpretation of a rather standard poetic number [25](#note25). I hope this review of Temple's misuse ancient myth in The Sirius Mystery has accomplished two things: first, to demonstrate that an author who cannot be trusted in big things (the truth of extraterrestrial visitation) cannot be trusted in small things either; and second, to put to rest the persistent myth that even if one does not support Temple's conclusions about intelligent space-faring frogmen that his scholarship and erudition are still an important contribution to the study of ancient mythology and history. There is a bit of poetic irony in all this, too. Robert Temple's knowledge of Jason and the Argonauts, and the story's history and development, seems to derive entirely from Robert Graves and his Greek Myths. Temple does not directly cite the Jason tales of Hesiod, Pindar, and Apollonius, the ancient authors from whom we derive our knowledge of the myth [26](#note26). Had he done so, he might just have noticed a curious passage in Apollonius, who describes Medea's first glimpse of Jason at their clandestine meeting in Hecate's temple: \"[H]e appeared to her as she desired, like Sirius leaping high from Ocean...\" [27](#note27). There you have it: Jason is Sirius! Of course, this is nothing but a bit of poetic simile, but its omission underscores just how poorly researched The Sirius Mystery really is, despite its hundreds of endnotes and reputation as the thinking person's ancient astronaut book.

Temple confesses ignorance of the image's meaning, implying that he neither recalled Graves's interpretation of this image nor researched the scholarly literature, which had discussed the image since at least the nineteenth century. In another plate (again mirror reversed), he misidentifies a standard scene of Medea magically resurrecting a ram as an alchemical transmutation of a ram into gold and Pelias as Jason, demonstrating his lack of familiarity with the scholarly literature and Greek mythology in general. - Sacks, D., Murray, O., and Bunson, M. 1997.

Farmer traces the swings between classical and Keynesian economics since the early 20th century, gracefully explaining the elements of both theories. During the Great Depression, Keynes challenged the longstanding idea that an economy was a self-correcting mechanism; but his school gave way to a resurgence of classical economics in the 1970s \u2014 a rise that ended with the current crisis. Rather than simply allowing the pendulum to swing back, Farmer writes, we must synthesize the two. The goal, he says, is to correct the excesses of a free-market economy without stifling entrepreneurship and instituting central planning.

Motorcycle Maintenance Without the Zen How Pirsig's Mistakes About Atheism Continue Today by Chris Edwards ROBERT PIRSIG, AUTHOR OF THE WILDLY POPULAR and perennial bestseller, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, could be seen as the founding father of modern pop philosophy. Pirsig may also be the first modern writer to rework old religious fallacies into mysticism/New Age philosophy. Many of his errors have been passed on to modern day gurus and shamans such as Deepak Chopra. Pirsig's book, first published in 1974, sought to undermine scientific thinking and created an audience of cult-like followers who persist in believing in Pirsig's non-material claims. Those who doubt Pirsig's continuing influence might look to Mark Richardson's recently released book [Zen and Now: On the Trail of Robert Pirsig and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307390691?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0307390691). In this book the author, like so many of Pirsig's devotees, traveled the famous route that Pirsig did on his motorcycle. I too would like to follow Pirsig's path, but with a different intention. I'd like to provide maintenance on his logic. Perhaps debunking Pirsig, even at this late date, will be helpful for addressing the claims of the many pop philosophers and gurus who have begun writing for the niche market that he created. In the Introduction to the 1999 paperback edition of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, the author mentions schizophrenia. In reference to his own battles with what appears to be some version of split personality disorder, he wrote: \"There is a divided personality here: two minds fighting for the same body, a condition that inspired the original meaning of 'schizophrenia.'\" The more psychologically correct definition of schizophrenia is a diagnosis of an individual who cannot distinguish between the images in his head and images in the world. When the condition of this definition is chronic it is defined as a mental disorder. When it is selective we call it faith. Pirsig's philosophical mistakes are all schizophrenic in that he cannot always tell the difference between things that merely exist in the mind and things that exist in the world. New Age philosophers often try to distance themselves from their more dogmatic religious cousins. However, a close examination of Pirsig's writing shows that the errors he makes are carnival mirror distortions of those that plague religion. In the book, which Pirsig informs us is a chatauquah \u2014 a long philosophical discourse told through an individual narrative \u2014 the central theme is Pirsig's search for something that falls outside of the traditional philosophical arena. His alter ego \"Phaedrus\" (Pirsig's personality before a long bout with mental illness) became consumed with the concept of \"Quality\" and went into a deep cavern of philosophical thought in search of what it meant. In order to prevent his search from becoming a scientific quest, Pirsig makes a few clumsy attacks on scientific materialism, otherwise known as atheism. Here is what he writes: Phaedrus felt that ... scientific materialism was by far the easiest to cut to ribbons. This, he knew from his earlier education, was na\u00efve science. He went after it ... using the reductio ad absurdum. This form of argument rest on the truth that if the inevitable conclusions from a set of premises are absurd then it follows logically that at least one of the premises that produced them is absurd. Let's examine, he said, what follows from the premise that anything not composed of mass-energy is unreal or unimportant. He used the number zero as a starter. Zero originally a Hindu number, was introduced to the West by Arabs during the Middle Ages and was unknown to the ancient Greeks and Romans. How was that? He wondered. Had nature so subtly hidden the zero that all the Greeks and all the Romans \u2014 millions of them \u2014 couldn't find it? One would normally think that zero is right out there in the open for everyone to see. He showed the absurdity of trying to derive zero from any form of mass-energy, and then asked, rhetorically, if that meant the number zero was \"unscientific.\" If so, did that mean that digital computers, which function exclusively in terms of ones and zeros, should be limited to just ones for scientific work? No trouble finding the absurdity here. (297-298) Pirsig's brief dismissal of \"scientific materialism\" aka \"atheism\" has an outsized importance for his book. Once he has gotten those pesky rules of science out of the way, he is free to meander through the mystical and philosophical caverns until he finds his Quality \u2014 a strange trip given the fact that he doesn't want to be able to touch or even define it. The problem with the quoted passage is that he reduced the wrong argument to absurdity \u2014 his own. First of all, the number zero was invented not discovered in the same way that Newton invented calculus or that Darwin invented evolutionary theory. This does not mean that moving objects began with Newton or that evolution began with Darwin, it merely means that humanity finally created a language that could describe a real world phenomenon. The notion that the Greeks and Romans could not see zero is about as significant as saying that the citizens of a landlocked country could not see a ship. In Charles Seife's wonderful book [Zero: Biography of a Dangerous Idea](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140296476?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0140296476), he pointed out that Greek mathematics concerned itself primarily with geometry because it was useful for farming and building. They could not conceive of negative landholdings, for example. The concept of zero was created sometime during the 5th or 6th century in the Gupta Dynasty when Hindu thinkers began to contemplate the infinite and the void. Gupta mathematics was impressive and the calculations they were able to do amounted to a scientific revolution. This being said, it would not be proper to say that Indian mathematics was right and Greek mathematics was wrong. This would be like saying that the French language is wrong and German is right. What could be said is that Indian mathematics is more expressive than Greek. The Greeks seem not to have spent much time contemplating the infinite or the void, which is why they had no names for them. The Hindus, driven by a religion that encouraged contemplation of such things, did. Central African tribesmen could hardly be expected to have a word for snow. The Greeks did not contemplate the infinite or the void therefore they had no terms for them. Yet snow, particles, the infinite, and the void exist (or in the case of the last, don't exist but the concept does). It is only when cultures are made aware of things that they needed language for them and then, because the knowledge of these things was borrowed, so too, were the mathematical and linguistic \"names\" for them. We see this process occurring all the time. When Americans first encountered Mexican salsa we borrowed not only their sauce but their word for it as well. If we were given a certain limited amount of sensory data \u2014 say the observation of the sun peeking over the horizon every morning \u2014 we could develop two different mathematical models, or languages, to describe this phenomenon. At first, the Ptolemaic view and the Copernican view would both suffice and there would be no way of saying which was more descriptive. However, let us say that we get a new piece of sensory data, as Galileo did when he used his telescope to see the rotation pattern of the moons of Jupiter, and that one of these models more accurately predicts and describes these new facts, then we would be able to say that one model was the better descriptor of all the facts. The Copernican \"theory\" is more descriptive of sensory data and gives us a more accurate description of what is really happening in the universe. Thus, because this language was more effective, it displaced the Ptolemaic version. If we understand this we can see that Zeno's famous paradox, for example, was not a paradox at all. Zeno was simply showing the Greeks that their mathematics (devoid of zero) had no way of describing movement. Modern mathematics, far from being a hard objective \"thing\" is instead a mish-mash of concepts that arose from a process of cultural synthesis (almost entirely in Eurasia, where cultures were easily able to intermesh because of war and trade). The Greeks contributed geometry, the Gupta Indians the numbers 0-9 and the decimal system, the Muslims gave us Al-Jabr, the English gave us physics, calculus, and the Germans contributed the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. Each time, a culture's language was adopted and added not because they were \"right\" but because they were more descriptive of objective phenomena and therefore a \"better\" language. In Zen, Pirsig devoted several pages to the mathematician Poncaire' (1854-1912) and the supposed mathematical crisis of his time, which involved the \"discovery\" that two different types of mathematical language \u2014 one called Lobachevskian and the other Euclidian (which became known as the Riemann) \u2014 could be used. Pirsig wrote: We now had two contradictory visions of unshakable scientific truth, true for all men of all ages, regardless of their individual preferences. This was the basis of the profound crisis that shattered the scientific complacency of the Gilded Age. How do we know which one of these geometries is right? If there is no basis for distinguishing between them, then you have a total mathematics which admits logical contradictions. But a mathematics which admits logical contradictions is not mathematics at all. The ultimate effect of the non-Euclidian geometries becomes nothing more than a magician's mumbo jumbo in which belief is sustained purely by faith! (335) We see here that Pirsig is again confused by what mathematics is. We cannot ask the question \"which of these geometries is right\" anymore than we can ask whether Portuguese or Inuit is the \"right\" language. What we could ask, is, which is more descriptive for the sensory data we have? Therefore, a paragraph down, Pirsig answered his own question: \"According to the Theory of Relativity, Riemann geometry best describes the world we live in.\" (335) Reification is not a small mistake. Pirsig's claim that computers run on Liebniz's binary code, which works through a series of zeros and ones is not helpful. Does he actually think that computers run on concepts? There are no zeros in a computer but rather a series of electrical \"holders\" that are either switched on or off. Humans simply describe this in terms of zeros or ones. Again, this is subjective. Once this is understood, all of Pirsig's philosophy falls apart. Consider this oft-quoted passage of a conversation between him and his son: \"...the laws of physics and of logic ... the number system ... the principle of algebraic substitution. These are ghosts. We just believe in them so thoroughly they seem real.\" \"They seem real to me,\" John says. \"I don't get it,\" says Chris. So I go on. \"For example, it seems completely natural to presume that gravitation and the law of gravitation existed before Isaac Newton. It would sound nutty to think that until the seventeenth century there was no gravity.\" \"Of course.\" \"So when did this law start? Has it always existed?\" John is frowning and wondering what I'm getting at. \"What I'm driving at,\" I say, \"is the notion that before the beginning of the earth, before the sun and the stars were formed, before the primal generation of anything, the law of gravity existed.\" \"Sure.\" \"Sitting there, having no mass of its own, no energy of its own, not in anyone's mind because there wasn't anyone, not in space because there was no space either, not anywhere \u2014 this law of gravity still existed?\" Now John seems not so sure. \"If that law of gravity existed,\" I say, \"I honestly don't know what a thing has to do to be nonexistent. It seems to me that law of gravity has passed every test of nonexistence there is. You cannot think of a singe attribute of nonexistence that that law of gravity didn't have. Or a single scientific attribute of existence it did have. And yet it is still 'common sense' to believe that it existed.\" John says, \"I guess I'd have to think about it.\" \"Well, I predict that if you think about it long enough you will find yourself going round and round and round and round until you finally reach only one possible, rational, intelligent conclusion. The law of gravity and gravity itself did not exist before Isaac Newton. No other conclusion makes sense. \"And what that means,\" I say before he can interrupt, \"and what that means is that the law of gravity exists nowhere except in people's heads! It's a ghost! We are all of us very arrogant and conceited about running down other people's ghosts but just as ignorant and barbaric and superstitious as our own.\" (41-42) Again, Pirsig mistakes the law of gravity for a thing. Of course the law of gravity could not have existed before there was anything because without matter then objects would not be attracted to each other because there would be no objects. If we define the \"law of gravity\" as a description of real-world phenomena, in the same way that the word \"rock\" is used to describe a slab of granite, then no, the law of gravity did not exist before Newton. However, if we describe the law of gravity as the attraction that objects, depending on weight, have for each other then of course it existed \u2014 just as sound waves came from the falling tree even if no ears were around to hear it. Pirsig might as well be saying that the word \"rock\" was floating around in the universe before there were ever rocks, or that poems about flowers existed before there were flowers or poets to write about them. He might as well be Plato. This fallacious thinking is what eventually leads him to this conclusion about his central conceit, which is the search for Quality: Quality is not just the result of the collision between subject and object. The very existence of subject and object themselves is deduced from the Quality event. The Quality event is the cause of the subjects and objects, which are then mistakenly presumed to be the cause of the Quality! Now he had that whole damned evil dilemma by the throat. (304) Actually; he was just strangling a reification, holding a shadow in a headlock. Because Pirsig had so often committed the philosophical sin of reification, he had turned something called \"Quality\" which is elusive by definition, into a kind of creator god. It existed before matter, apparently. This is like saying that the painting of a mountain created both the painter and the mountain. Quality is a subjective term in that it differs from person to person. The fact that most of us recognize Quality in the same way is not particularly remarkable given that the human race has similar DNA. Neither is it historically remarkable that separated human civilizations developed mathematics, language, mythologies, and religions. The mistake is when these human developments become reified, such as when people mistake subjective human-made gods for actual Gods. Pirsig's \"philosophy\" is different only in degree, not in kind, from any other religion.

The Remarkable Story of Professor Antony Flew \u2014 The World's Most Notorious Atheist Who Changed His Mind On April 8, 2010, the British philosopher Antony Flew passed away after a long life in academic philosophy, having taught at Oxford, Aberdeen, Keele, and Reading universities. For most of his career Professor Flew was one of the world's most outspoken and prominent atheists, until he changed his mind in the closing years of his life, apparently impressed by the arguments from Intelligent Design creationists, most notably with regard to the complexity of DNA. In 2004, Flew co-authored a book entitled [There is a God: How the World's Most Notorious Atheist Changed His Mind](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061335304?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0061335304). The co-author was Roy Abraham Varghese, who became the center of controversy when the New York Times published an article alleging that Flew was in serious mental decline and that the book \u2014 and by implication the conversion itself \u2014 was perhaps contrived or highly influenced by Varghese. In this week's eSkeptic, we present the following article by Kenneth Grubbs, which was written before Flew died and aims to get at the truth of Flew's conversion. Kenneth is a long-time skeptic and freelance writer living with his family in Southeast Michigan. Kenneth also writes for the free-thinking website [Isaac's Rainbow](http://isaacsrainbow.com/). Antony Flew, 1923-2010 Following the Argument Wherever it Leads a tribute by Kenneth Grubbs A bristling chill swept the dimming colorless sky over Reading, England one evening earlier this year. In weather uncannily, perhaps even poignantly, similar it was my profound pleasure to speak at length with the delightful and charming Annis Flew, wife of the now notorious Antony Flew who, after almost 70 years vigorously defending atheism apparently changed his mind. Today, at the age of 87, Flew considers himself a deist. At least that is what Annis made clear to me when we spoke in January. Flew, The Man At the University of Oxford, during the war-ravaged 1940s, a group of undergraduate students, presided over by C. S. Lewis, gathered each Monday evening below ground in the Junior Common Room of St. Hilda's College to passionately debate Christianity and atheism. This elite group, known as The Socratic Club, was the \"intellectual hub of Oxford.\" At its core is the Socratic maxim to \"Follow the argument wherever it leads,\" a principle that would guide Flew his entire life. It was here at the Socratic club in 1950 that a 27-year old Flew presented his first relevant work, Theology and Falsification. It was also here at Oxford that he would meet Annis, the woman who would become his wife and lifelong friend and the woman with the kind and steady voice I would speak with on a crisp January evening, some 60 years later. Professor Flew authored more than 35 books and essays on such diverse philosophical topics as free will and determinism, crime, evolution, logic, ethics, and language. His landmark works include [God and Philosophy](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591023300?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1591023300) (1966), [The Presumption of Atheism](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0301750165?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0301750165) (1976), and now, of course, [There is a God: How the World's Most Notorious Atheist Changed His Mind](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061335304?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0061335304) (2007). I tried to gain access to Professor Flew for this story, but he was in an Extended Care Facility in Reading, England, tired, confused, and in the paralyzing grasp of advanced dementia. He had been there for well more than a year, and Annis informed me that \"Tony is rarely aware of his surroundings anymore.\" There would be no interview. Flew, The Book There is a God was published in 2007 by Harper One, the imprint of Harper Collins focusing on predominantly religious and spiritual works. The book is \"about why I changed my mind,\" Flew writes. His name appears in large print on the jacket. Below it, in considerably smaller type, it reads \"with Roy Abraham Varghese.\" From the jacket we also learn that the book is the \"Winner of the Christianity Today Book Award.\" This is a curious honor, given that deism shares almost nothing with Christianity, nor any other religion; but far more importantly, Annis informed me without hesitation that \"Tony never came to recognize any of the revealed religions.\" Roy Varghese penned the 18-page Preface. The Introduction is written by Flew, spanning four and one half pages. In it comes the thunderous recant, \"I now believe there is a God.\" There are two Appendices. Roy Varghese writes the first. Its 22 pages consist of one part \"New Atheist\" bashing, and two parts tiresome argument. Bishop N.T. Wright, an Oxford New Testament Scholar, writes the second appendix. Before Wright begins his 28-page essay, \"The Self-Revelation of God in Human History: A Dialogue on Jesus,\" there is a brief paragraph by Flew inviting Wright to contribute, an odd invitation from a deist. Flew, The Controversy In December of 2004, 54 battle weary years after Theology and Falsification was first introduced at the Socratic Club, a lifetime of work was forever fractured when the Associated Press released the story that Antony Flew, famed British philosopher and atheist, \"now believes in God.\" In 2007, not long after Flew's book was released, Mark Oppenheimer wrote an essay in the New York Times magazine (\"The Turning of an Atheist,\" November 4), for which he interviewed both Flew and Varghese. I spoke with Mark in February, who told me that Professor Flew informed him with no ambiguity that he did not write the book. \"This is really Roy's doing,\" Flew said, \"He showed it to me and I said OK.\" When Oppenheimer interviewed Varghese, he too stated that the book was his idea, and that he (Varghese) \"did all the original writing,\" but that the \"substantive\" material came from Flew's previous work. Oppenheimer describes Varghese as a Christian apologist as well as a \"crusader for (and financial backer of) those who believe that scientific research helps verify the existence of God.\" Varghese met Flew at a conference in 1985. Subsequent to Oppenheimer's story, Varghese wrote a letter to the editor of the New York Times magazine: \"First the good news: Antony Flew is alive and well (physically and mentally)\" (\"Doubting Antony Flew,\" November 5, 2007. This letter was written just one year prior to Flew's dementia requiring hospitalization). When I spoke with Mark he reminded me that Harper One wasn't entirely satisfied with Varghese's prose, so they asked Bob Hostetler, an evangelical pastor, to re-write many of the passages, \"To make it more reader friendly,\" according to Varghese himself. So the ghostwriter had a ghostwriter! In essence then, two-thirds of Antony Flew's book is actually Roy Varghese writing for Flew, with some undefined portion written by Bob Hostetler writing for Varghese. The remaining one-third of the book is Varghese writing as Varghese, taking puerile whacks at the \"New Atheists\" in Appendix A; and Bishop Wright in Appendix B, writing as Bishop Wright, presenting his 28-page Christian dissertation. As Annis said, \"All those Christians [were] trying to pull him to their bosom.\" Yet almost unbelievably, nowhere in There is a God is any of this information disclosed. The omissions alone are disturbing. \"The most disappointing thing to me,\" Oppenheimer told me, reflecting back with clear candor, \"is the cynicism of the publishing industry. They knew they made a mistake, and never took the opportunity to correct it.\" Roy Varghese declined my request for an interview. He did email me a written statement to highlight three points. First, he explained that the statements made in the book have been made by Flew in other forums as well. Second, Flew signed off on the book's manuscript multiple times. And third, Varghese arranged a special meeting attended by himself, Professor Flew and Professor Richard Swinburne, famed Christian apologist and long time friend of Flew. The expressed intent of the meeting was for Swinburne to assess Flew's genuine views, as well as his capacity. Swinburne wrote a testament proclaiming Flew's grasp of the material, suggesting that Flew's position was \"most of the way toward Christianity.\" (Varghese was kind enough to send me a copy of Swinburne's statement). The fact that Varghese felt the need for a third party confirmation regarding Flew's capacity raises concerns. And having decided that such a confirmation was necessary, it would have been more persuasive had a truly independent third party, rather than a Christian apologist, conducted it. Of the three important points Varghese wanted me to know, point number three negates points one and two. If Flew's capacity is questionable to Varghese, then the credibility of expressing his newfound views in other forums and signing off on manuscripts is not compelling. At this juncture then, having reviewed the controversy, having considered Flew's age and capacity, and having considered the potentially biased motives of those around him, our story finally intersects with its purpose. Simply put, these antics are of no relevance to us here. Why? Because the Socratic maxim so dear to Flew's heart is not to follow the man; it is instead to follow the argument. Professor Antony Flew affirms that he is a deist; so stipulated. We will follow the argument and see where it leads. Flew, The Argument When someone abandons lifelong convictions, changes their mind, and writes a book to explain it all, we should expect new and dramatic reasoning. Let's follow the argument spelled out in There is a God. \"Science spotlights three dimensions of nature that point to God,\" the argument begins in earnest, summarily invoking the authority of science. \"The first is the fact that nature obeys laws. The second is the dimension of life, of intelligently organized and purpose-driven beings, which arose from matter. The third is the very existence of nature.\" Notice that these points are nothing more than observations for which science is seeking evidence. They are, in and of themselves, not evidence per se, nor do they \"point to\" anything, despite the semantic implications to the contrary. The argument continues, \"How did the laws of nature come to be? How did life as a phenomenon originate from non-life?\" And lastly, \"How did the universe, by which we mean all that is physical, come into existence?\" The three scientific observations preceding these questions have been carefully crafted into questions from which the inferences, according to the authors, can only be God. Put more simply, the unspoken conclusion we are to infer is, what else could it be, but God? This is the backbone of the argument for deism. The enigmatic truth that biology and cosmology remain confounded by these questions has been creatively reconstituted into would be articles of evidence. Flew/Varghese argue that, \"Perhaps the most popular and intuitively plausible argument for God's existence is the so-called argument from design.\" Having now read hundreds of pages of masterfully constructed arguments from this classically trained Oxford philosopher, in my opinion Professor Flew would shudder at the notion of employing \"popular\" or \"intuitively plausible\" statements as arguments for or against anything. They write, \"What I think the DNA material has done is that it has shown, by almost unbelievable complexity of the arrangements which are needed to produce life, that intelligence must have been involved.\" Consider this passage from God and Philosophy, written by Flew in 1966: \"Certainly it is proper to feel the awe in the contemplation of the human eye or of the single living cell. But no exploitation, however breathtaking, of the limitations and potentialities of materials would give good ground for inferring Omnipotence.\" So what changed? Did complexity became more complex? Did design became better designed? Is Flew's qualification, \"however breathtaking,\" invalidated by the complexity of DNA? Another cornerstone of any argument for deism is the Anthropic Principle. Flew/Varghese submit the weight of electrons, the speed of light, and gravitational constants to demonstrate that the universe is too \"fine tuned\" to be accidental. Again, these observations contribute nothing substantive \u2014 they are simply statements about the universe, not packets of data' \u2014 save the same misleading implication what else could it be, but God? The authors conclude: \"The only satisfactory explanation for the origin of such 'end-directed, self-replicating' life as we see on earth is an infinitely intelligent Mind.\" The logic proffered fails as an argument because it requires us to accept the lack of knowledge as knowledge, and the lack of evidence as evidence. This is Argumentum ad Ignorantiam, or, appeal to ignorance. It is also the Burden of Proof Fallacy, which states that if we cannot prove X to be false, then X is true; the inability to disprove X becomes the proof of X. The argument is of course invalid. Bertrand Russell was fond of suggesting that a teapot orbited the sun just beyond Mars; no one can disprove his claim, therefore it is true. If we follow the this line of reasoning we must accept the conclusion that the more evidence we lack ... the greater the likelihood that God exists. The argument beckons for God to be defined as \"the sum of all knowledge yet acquired.\" This was the reason Flew wrote The Presumption of Atheism back in 1976. It was written to mirror the legal maxim, Ei incumbit probation qui dicit, non qui negat, or \"The onus of proof lies on the proposition, not on the opposition.\" Flew noted in that book: \"If it is to be established that there is a God, then we have to have good grounds for believing that this is indeed so. Until and unless some such grounds are produced we have literally no reason at all for believing.\" The absence of evidence hardly qualifies as \"good grounds\" for anything, much less god, and thus our expectations for some epiphanic insight to leap from the pages of this book and help us understand the basis for Professor Flew's recantation have been thoroughly dashed. The landscape of science has changed in almost unrecognizable proportions since Flew's early life. However, it is unreasonable \u2014 irrational even \u2014 to suggest that Flew's original position opposing complexity as an argument for a Divine Mind was only a matter of degree. If complexity is a poor argument for the existence of God (and it is) then the degree of complexity is an irrelevant attribute. Flew, The Conclusion As a species our hunger for answers is insatiable. So desperate are we to understand the universe around us that for untold centuries we have refused to accept any \"gap\" in that understanding. Unexplained phenomena are the spawning grounds for ghost stories, sea monsters, grassy knolls, and a Divine Mind. Antony Flew understood this as well as anyone. He devoted a lifetime of vigorous intellectual argument against presuming God. Today we are asked to accept that he has changed his mind. With asterisks in hand, we accept. Could we make a cogent argument \"pointing to\" his age and capacity as factors that might mitigate a change of this magnitude? We could. Are there uncertainties that could warrant a tenable challenge to the motives of those individuals surrounding Flew, with regard to his \"conversion\" and the curiously construction and authorship of the book? There are. Should the publishers bear any responsibility for preventing misperceptions concerning the disclosure of would-be ghostwriters? They should. There is little hope of ever reconciling the Antony Flew of 87 years with the Antony Flew of 27 years. Did he change his mind, or did his mind change him? History will record Antony Flew as a deist; Annis Flew confirmed that for us all. History, I fear, becomes an unwitting conspirator, forever defiled. With so many varied aspects to this story, it is easy to forget that which matters most. Antony Garrard Newton Flew, philosopher, professor, author, atheist pioneer, and devoted husband, is now gone. For more than 60 years this thinker, this man of great intellect, marched to a different drum and followed the argument. We owe him much. The last of the old guard, Professor Flew's festschrift deserves to be written with admiration and respect for a distinguished philosopher.

Kenneth Grubbs is a long-time skeptic and freelance writer living with his family in Southeast Michigan. The Good News ... Again? a book review by Kenneth Grubbs DR. TIMOTHY KELLER is a highly regarded Presbyterian minister in New York City. Not surprisingly then, [The Reason for God: Belief in an Age of Skepticism](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594483493?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1594483493), draws considerably more from Christian doctrine than from philosophical pondering. From the outset the Reverend makes a concerted effort to paint skepticism with the same brush he uses to justify his Christian beliefs \u2014 simply by defining them both as resting on the same premise of faith. He writes in his Introduction that, \"All doubts, however skeptical and cynical they may seem, are really a set of alternate beliefs.\" He asks the reader to accept the notion that belief in God is as equally valid as belief in skepticism since both positions rely equally on belief. The author also argues that turning to evolutionary psychology for explanations on the nature and origins of belief presupposes a belief in evolutionary psychology. The book itself is divided into two parts. Part 1, The Leap of Doubt, addresses some of the most common \"doubts\" and \"objections\" that Keller has faced during the course of his career. Included are such questions as; \"How could a good God allow suffering?\", and, \"How could a loving God send people to Hell?\" The other doubts to be considered and refuted include the literal inerrancy of the Bible, past historical injustices of the church, and science's role in casting doubt on religion. To understand how an omniscient and omnipotent God could or would permit needless pain and suffering in the world, the author suggests that, \"Just because you can't see or imagine a good reason why God might allow something to happen doesn't mean that there can't be one.\" We should simply accept on faith that it is our limited capacity that prevents us from understanding God's \"reasons.\" When considering the Bible's clear acceptance of slavery, the author asks us to concede that the apparent conflict is also nothing more than our limited understanding, this time of \"historical context.\" He writes with authority that, \"When the New Testament was written, there was not a great deal of difference between slaves and the average free person.\" But condoning the acceptance of slavery by saying that everyone was oppressed hardly supports the notion that the opinions of biblical authors were divinely inspired higher morality. On the literal inerrancy of the Bible, Keller espouses his conviction to the concept, and then qualifies his conviction. He reflects, \"I think Genesis 1 has the earmarks of poetry and is therefore a \"song\" about the wonder and meaning of God's creation.\" In this well crafted model, the Bible remains inerrant insomuch as our definition is stretched to include its poetical value. In a brief \"Intermission\" before moving on to Part 2 titled The Reasons for Faith, we are again cautioned about the vulnerable and shaky nature of skepticism. Keller restates that, \"Underlying all doubts about Christianity are alternative beliefs, unprovable assumptions about the nature of things.\" He continues that we should \"not expect conclusive proof\", and that \"reason alone won't be enough.\" With the bar now lowered to exclude evidence and reason, and with skepticism dismissed as an alternate belief, the author sets the tone for the second half of the book. Part 2 is presented as a series of \"clues\", and the reader is informed that these clues will \"cumulatively\" point to God. The first of these clues is the \"fine-tuning\" of the universe, Paley's watch, the Anthropic Principle, the inexplicably perfect nature of such things as the electromagnetic force, gravity, and the temperature that water freezes. That these precise features occur, and are required to support the existence of the universe is, most assuredly in the author's mind, a profound reason for God. Beauty itself points to God. Keller writes that, \"in the presence of great art and beauty we inescapably feel that there is real meaning in life.\" The double whammy here is that the door is now open for feelings to qualify as \"clues\", and that \"real meaning in life\" implies the existence of God. In addition, Keller states with clarity and conviction that the existence of moral imperatives also implies that God exists. He flatly states that \"If there is no God, then there is no way to say any one action is 'moral' and another 'immoral'.\" These \"clues\" eventually also include the \"infinite sacrifice\" of Jesus Christ's death on the cross, and the \"miracle of the resurrection.\" Both of these events, according to the author, are clearly evidenced by eyewitnesses at the empty tomb, and further corroborated by other irrefutable eye witness accounts prior to Jesus' ascension. Reverend Keller also claims that the Christian God of Jesus Christ maintains a theological status superior to the other monotheistic Gods of our day, and goes on to explain the distinction. He writes that the other monotheistic faiths have founders who claimed to show the way to salvation, however \"only Jesus claimed to be the way.\" (Italics added). To Keller these semantics endow Christianity with superior sanction over Judaism and Islam; a bold assertion. The remaining chapters, among other things, advocate for the redeeming value of a fierce and terrifying eternal hell, and the need for us to \"submit\" to our Lord. Keller writes, \"He is our Creator, and for that fact alone we owe him everything.\" Timothy Keller's, The Reason for God, though falling short of any expectations one might harbor based on the title, does serve us with distinction as an important offering of contemporary conservative Christian thought. The reader hoping for philosophically satisfying discourse on an Uncaused First Cause may find himself frustrated and sadly disappointed by the more narrow scope of Reverend Keller's dogmatic perspective. Nevertheless, for anyone wishing to maintain an understanding of modern fundamentalist Christian doctrine, this work is a must read.

On this first half of a two-part MonsterTalk, the hosts review two past ghost investigations (Ben Radford's \" [Kimo Theater Ghost](http://alibi.com/index.php?story=25111&scn=feature&submit_user_comment=y)\" and Dr. Karen Stollznow's \" [Waverly Hills Sanatorium](http://bad-language.com/waverly.html)\" investigations) and discuss some of the techniques that can help solve such cases. What steps are common to this type of research? Learn more this week on MonsterTalk. In this week's eSkeptic, Andrew Bernardin discusses the tendency to find meaning in random patterns. In particular, he discusses sports talk notions such as the \"hot hand\" and being \"in the zone.\" Bernardin endeavors to deconstruct the zone and plunge the hot hand in a bucket of ice water. This article appeared in [Skeptic magazine, volume 11, number 2](https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/archives/vol11n02.html). Dr. Andrew Bernardin is a writer, lecturer, and adjunct professor of psychology at Daytona Beach Community College. He enjoys basketball and tennis and other sports that involve both skill and chance. He lives in Florida with his mixed-doubles partner (a.k.a. his wife). The Tea Leaves of Sports Talk Finding Meaning in Random Sequences by Dr. Andrew Bernardin ALTHOUGH I ENJOY PLAYING BASKETBALL, I cannot claim to have ever experienced a \"hot hand.\" Luke-warm, maybe. Nor have I ever found myself \"in the zone.\" Even if equipped with a G.P.S. and a topological map, I don't know if I could even locate the zone. Perhaps because of this, I will endeavor to deconstruct the zone and plunge the hot hand in a bucket of ice water. The non-phenomenon of basketball's hot hand has been addressed elsewhere (see Michael Shermer's review of the book, Intuition: Its Powers and Perils, in [Vol. 10, No. 1 of Skeptic magazine](https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/archives/vol10n01.html)). In brief, the findings indicate that a player who has hit a number of shots, and is thus considered hot, is no more likely to hit the next shot than his or her overall shooting percentage would predict. So there's no hot hand. Is this a big deal? I think so. The type of superstitious thinking behind the hot hand operates far beyond the basketball court. And although it may provide entertainment, when unchecked it can lead us seriously astray. Half a decade ago, tennis champion Goran Ivanisevic played at Wimbledon. That year he went on a winning streak. He advanced further and further toward the finals. Goran was one of the top players in the world, so this wasn't all that surprising. Nonetheless, Goran didn't want to jinx himself. So, game after game, he wore the same hat, which he did not bother to launder. Maybe he was aware of research showing that detergent can wash away benevolent spirits, positive vibrations, and quantum luck tunnels. Why Goran believed his hat was more instrumental to his good play than, say, his underwear, I don't know. With each match the hat got dirtier and sweatier and, no doubt, smellier. Was Goran's hat responsible for his advancing in the tournament? I'm sure Adidas, Nike, or whichever company had their logo on it, wished this were so. With the help of his hat, Goran made it to the finals. Also making it to the finals was the world rated number one Goliath of Wimbledons, Pete Sampras. Goran continued to play well in the finals, but his hat was apparently insufficiently powerful to overcome Sampras' dominating service game. Superstitious behavior, whether on a tennis court, basketball court, football field, or golf course, is relatively easy to recognize. Everyone can plainly see, for example, a baseball player making a sign of the cross before getting into the batter's box (in the name of the father, the son, and Babe Ruth, help me send the ball into the leftfield bleachers). Another form of sports superstition, finding meaning in random sequences, has a broader following than the quirky rituals and good luck charms of individual players. It permeates the talk of broadcasters, athletes, and fans; it infiltrates the minds of those drawn to games of all types. Superstitious behavior has been called irrational. Which it is. Yet while many people consider irrationality to be the consequence of faulty logic, much of it can be attributed to a straightforward problem of information misuse and/or neglect. When we are being rational, we properly weigh information to come to some conclusion or decision. Irrationality can thus be seen as the result of one or a number of the following: too little information, biased selection of information, poor quality information, and the improper weighing of information. Backspin-doctoring Sports One day in early 2003, I became aware of my own tendency to think irrationally in the domain of sports. I had played basketball and performed poorly. Many more of my shots found the outside of the rim than the inside of the net. I lingered on the court, trying to diagnose what had gone wrong. Why was my shooting \"off?\" Was I giving the ball enough backspin? I put up a shot with more backspin, and swish. Ah-hah. I took three more shots and hit all three. So that was it. I wasn't putting enough backspin on the ball. This was the hopeful conclusion I came to after hitting four shots in four attempts. I headed to the shower enthused, imagining that my play would be forever improved. Fortunately, I am a skeptic. That is why in the following weeks I began to test my conclusion. Over a number of sessions I took 800 free throws (shots from the penalty line): 400 without concentrating on anything other than trying to get the ball through the hoop, and another 400 while concentrating on giving the ball backspin. I chose 400 because I considered that number sufficiently large to rule out the influence of what some would call luck but what I think of as a non-representative sequence or \"turn of events.\" Because I am not a mathematician, and perhaps because my brain lacks an adequate level of serotonin, I wanted to err, if I did, on the side of too many trials of what I consider to be a pleasingly repetitive behavior. The results: I hit 278 of the 400 \"regular\" shots, or 69.5%. Of the \"backspin\" shots, I hit 267 of 400, or 66.8%. Evidently, adding more backspin to my shooting was not going to transform my game. What had caused me to come to the faulty conclusion that additional backspin was the difference between poor shooting and good? Too little information. There is not enough data contained in only four trials to develop any sound conclusions. And herein lies the key to superstition in sports: humans have the habit of bringing a quick-draw, deterministic mindset to probabilistic phenomena. With a deterministic event, there is a strict relation between cause and effect. If I hold a coin in my hand and drop it, the coin will fall to the ground. Each and every time I drop the coin it falls to the ground. Because the relation is deterministic, I can accurately predict the outcome. A probabilistic event, on the other hand, entails a relation between cause(s) and effect that is not one to one. There is, instead, a probability that a particular outcome will follow. In the case of the coin, the effect of it landing heads up cannot be strictly determined. I can only give the probability that it will land heads up: 50%. Try as I might, I cannot determine the outcome of the drop. As importantly \u2014 and central to the point \u2014 I also cannot, in hindsight, ascribe causal reasoning as to why the outcome was one way or the other. The coin didn't land tails-up because it wanted to, or because I'm unlucky, or because I was leaning on my left foot. The coin simply landed tails-up and that's all I can say about it. As a human I may be wired to find a simple reason for everything, but when it comes to probabilistic events, I must keep that tendency in check. If I don't, I will end up talking gibberish. Because there isn't a one-to-one correspondence between cause and effect with probabilistic events, it becomes necessary to gather a lot of information. For instance, imagine you are visiting a foreign planet and you want to know whether a balloon filled with oxygen gas will rise or sink in the windless atmosphere. In this case, you would only have to release the balloon a few times to determine the answer. After a limited number of trials you could predict what would happen. And you could offer a simple explanation as to why it did happen \u2014 something about the difference between the weight of the oxygen molecules in the balloon and those in the surrounding atmosphere. In this scenario, the balloon falling or rising would be a deterministic event. You could accurately predict what would happen. You could also offer a straightforward explanation for what had happened. Suppose you have established that the balloon sinks. Whether or not it will pop upon hitting the uniformly jagged surface of the planet is another question. The answer to this question may belong in the realm of probability. If you dropped the balloon twice and it didn't pop, you might be foolish to predict that the third time it also wouldn't pop. If a dropped balloon popped sometimes, but not others, then you could not determine the outcome of any subsequent drop. You would have to drop the balloon many, many times to establish the probability of what would happen. And once it happened, you could only explain any particular outcome by referring to the probabilities that you established. The above doesn't mean you are unable to learn or know anything about the balloon and its tendency to pop. You may discover, for example, that imparting a spin to the balloon increases the likelihood it will pop. However, to figure out what the probability is you couldn't rely on a few trials. Any conclusions drawn from a limited number of trials, from too little information, would be meaningless. So you make a great number of trials and discover that imparting a spin to the balloon increases its probability of popping by, say, 10%. On your next trial, you spin the balloon as you release it, and it pops upon hitting the ground. Can you then conclude that the spin caused it to pop? No. It may have popped regardless of the spin. There's no way for you to know whether the spin played a role in that particular pop or not. The Precisely Imprecise Nature of Sports Sports are exciting because we cannot precisely predict the outcome. If the team to win the Super Bowl could be forecast by adding the weight of the players for each side and comparing them, what fun would that be? Las Vegas, for one, would lose interest. Sporting events are probabilistic because human behavior is more like the flight of shotgun pellets than laser-guided missiles. Our elbows are not made of titanium. There is always a degree of imprecision \u2014 and thus randomness \u2014 in how we perform. Even the great Tiger Woods, under ideal conditions, is not going to shoot under par every time he plays golf. His play is imprecise. And when Tiger is imprecise, he is not precisely imprecise. The alternatives to a perfect drive or putt are many and cannot be predicted. Our imprecision generates random outcomes. And, whisperings of golf commentators aside, there is no meaning in the random. If you situated Tiger Woods 200 yards from the green and told him to hit the ball within 20 feet of the pin, you could not predict whether he would succeed on one shot or the next. After hitting 100 balls, the result would most likely resemble a shotgun blast \u2014 white pellets marring a green target, some of the marks inside the designated bulls-eye, some outside. If Tiger hit 60% of his shots within the bulls-eye, what could you say about those 100 shots? Well, from that distance Tiger hit 60% of his shots within 20 feet of the pin. Now imagine witnessing those 100 shots individually, as each one was made. What could you conclude about a single shot having hit or missed the target? Could you say that Tiger was distracted if he missed, or that he was \"feeling it\" if he hit? No. The same goes for short strings of hits and misses. Ten hits in a row does not mean that Tiger is on fire. Likewise, if Tiger misses his next 10 out of 15, we cannot rationally speak about some drop in performance. All-Star George's Hoop Dreams The game of basketball is particularly well suited to this discussion because the better players hit roughly 50% of their shots. What is the probability that a player is going to score on any given shot? Toss a coin. What is the reason a player hit or missed a specific shot? Unless the shot was deflected by an opponent, we cannot speak rationally about the cause of a single, probabilistic event. One night, while reading in bed, I wondered what would happen if I pretended a tossed coin was a basketball player. What would \"his\" performance look like? Would \"he\" get as hot and cold as the pros? I fetched a quarter and dubbed it \"All Star George.\" Because marquee players put up roughly 20 shots per game, I drew a 20 x 5 grid. George would shoot 10 shots in the first half, and 10 in the second, for a 5 game series, resulting in a total of 100 shots. While sitting up in bed \u2014 not what you would call controlled laboratory conditions \u2014 I began flipping the coin, making \"m\" (miss) and \"h\" (hit) marks on the paper. In the first half of the first game, the sequence looked like this: m-h-m-m-m-h-h-h-m-m. At halftime, George had hit 40% of his shots. As you can see, though George is a 50% shooter, his hits and misses do not predictably alternate. We know that. At least one part of our brain knows that. For the second half the results were surprising: h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-m-h. My quarter, George, had \"caught fire,\" making 90% of his shots. What had inspired George to do this? Combining stats for both halves, in the first game All Star George hit 13 of 20, or 65%. My quarter was obviously trying to impress me. During the second game, George hit 50% of his first half shots. Would he again catch fire in the second half? The ensuing sequence again surprised me: m-m-m-m-m-m-h-m-h-h. George went on another streak, but this time it was of misses. He hit only 3 of 10, although he did \"pick it up\" toward the end of the game. George's shooting percentage for the second game was 40%. Maybe his legs hadn't recovered from the great effort he put into the second half of the first game. In the middle of the third game I had to bring in another player. George the 1st had rolled under the bed. It was at this time in my flip, catch, slap, scribble routine that my wife looked over the top of the book she was trying to read. She told me that if I didn't wrap it up soon, she would cancel my research funding. Although I knew the probability of George hitting heads was 50%, I could not predict what would happen on each individual flip. Nor could I predict what George's shooting percentage would be for half of a game. When I completed the 5 games, I found that in only 4 of the 10 halves (10 shot sequences) did George hit the expected 50%. For the first halves of all 5 games, George hit 22 of 50 shots, which is 44%. For the second halves of the 5 games, George hit 28 shots of 50, or 56%. Could I have concluded from these 100 shots that George tended to \"step it up\" in the second half of each game? No. Numbers clipped from limited sequences are no more meaningful than the pattern left by tea leaves in the bottom of a cup. Once again, for probabilistic events we need a lot of information. If you're quick with math you will have noticed that over the 5-game series George went a perfect 50 for 100 \u2014 just what one would expect. What are the chances of that? I imagine it's at the peak of a bell curve of probability, but not the only statistically likely outcome. The Nicks v. the Twenty-Fivers I had conducted my quarter-flipping test during the NBA playoffs, which followed on the heels of the NCAA tournament games called March Madness. While watching the basketball contests, I had been hearing statements such as: he's really raised the level of his game (after a string of hits), they're looking for someone to get a hot hand (I kid you not), they're completely out of sync (after a string of misses), that basket will really build his confidence (same thing happened for George, I think), he's making some good shot selections (string of hits), he's rushing his shot (he missed), I couldn't find my rhythm (he missed a lot), and he hasn't stepped it up (after a player went 1 for 6, rather than his average 2.9 for 6). Many of the NCAA games were so close I wondered if the winner could be said to have been determined by the toss of a coin ... by luck (a sequence terminating at a fortuitous point?). Though sports commentators may jabber about the winning team having \"brought their A game,\" in such a close contest, and with all other things being equal \u2014 for instance, one team not having lost their best player to injury \u2014 could the commentators come to any rational conclusion about the outcome? For my next coin-tossing project, I decided to re-enact a game. I would pit one coin against another, alternating tosses like trips up and down a basketball court. I called one team the \"Nicks\" and used a nickel to represent them. The other I called the \"Twenty-Fivers.\" Each coin would be tossed 100 times during the game. For each hit, or \"heads,\" the team would be awarded 2 points. Due to the probability of a coin coming up heads, I figured the final score would be, oh, near-100 to near-100. But would either coin take a dramatic lead during the contest? As in basketball, I broke the game into two halves with two periods each half (to avoid confusion, I'll forgo the customary term \"quarters\"). It began with a coin toss. I must admit I was excited to see who would win. Because I have the sad habit of rooting for the underdog in almost any contest \u2014 and am thus frequently disappointed by the outcome \u2014 I secretly rooted for the smaller Nicks. Ten shots into the game, the Nicks were up 14 to 10, having hit 7 of 10. Twelve shots later they were up 16 to 10. At 20 shots they were up by 4, having hit 2 more shots than the Twenty- Fivers. The Nicks increased their lead by the end of the period to 28 to 22. For that period, my Nicks had shot 56%, the opposition, 44%. During the first half of the second period, each coin went on a mini-run, with the Nick's lead increasing, then falling back to 6 points. Then, during the end of the second period, my team went flat, hitting only 2 of 8. Meanwhile, the Twenty-Fivers went an impressive 7 for 8 and took the lead. The score: 50 to 56. In the second period the Nicks had shot a somewhat wimpy 44%, while the Twenty-Fivers razzle-dazzled their way to a red-hot 68% shooting. I gave my Nicks a pep talk during half-time. I know, a good scientist tries to eliminate all bias, but I couldn't help myself. \"You can do it!\" I coached my coin. I was both amused and dismayed by my sincere excitement over a competition involving the tossing of two coins, but this was high drama. Third period. Although neither team scored above average, and both went 0 for 6 at some point, my Nicks did particularly poorly. For the period \u2014 a 25-flip sequence \u2014 they shot a dismal 36%. Hadn't they listened to me? Meanwhile, the Twenty-Fivers shot a respectable 48% and increased their lead to double digits. The score after three periods of play: 68 to 80. Could my Nicks rally in the fourth period? During the final period of play, both teams shot \"lights out.\" My Nicks put together two impressive strings, hitting 7 for 7 \u2014 they were in the zone \u2014 then later going 5 for 5. Unfortunately, the Nick's 68% shooting in the final period wasn't enough. The Twenty-Fivers shot 64%, winning the game 112 to 102. Apparently the Twenty- Fivers \"wanted it more.\" The quarter I tossed landed heads-up 56 times out of 100, 6% greater than expected. Is this unusual? The result, certainly, is somewhat farther out of the fat of the bell curve than a perfect 50% would be. Maybe I could repeat the project 100 times and not get the same result. And that is what makes sports so exciting. Beyond the real human drama, such as raw ability, strategy, injuries, rivalries, etc., sporting events entail a virtual mosh-pit of probabilities. Science Interrupted This is not to say that the outcome of sporting events is completely random, the result of a coin toss. Were a pee-wee football team to play the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the 2003 NFL Super Bowl champions would win. Probably. And that probability is very, very high. That said, if the two teams played a game every day for a million years, one day the pee-wees might win one. Just as if you were to prop a monkey at a keyboard, sooner or later, through random typing, he might string out the entire Origin of Species. It may take a billion trillion years, but it could happen. Trying to grasp the meaning, or lack thereof, of probabilities can be like forcing a square peg into a round hole \u2014 we aren't accustomed to thinking that way. Despite the fact that we can rationally say so little about the causes of an individual hit or miss, or even short strings of hits or misses, whether they be in golf, basketball, tennis, baseball or even croquet, human beings tend to jump to conclusions. We like to find meaning for things, and so we do, whether or not this is rational behavior. In the first game of the 2003 NBA finals, the New Jersey Nets hit their first three shots. They had just come off a one-week layoff, having waited for the Spurs to finish out their series with the Los Angeles Lakers. The television commentators, always in need of something to talk about, had speculated as to whether the time off would help the Nets or hurt them. After going three for three, one of the talking-heads declared that there was \"no rust on them.\" Had the Nets missed their first three, I'm sure I would have heard how they were rusty. Funny, my tossed coins never got rusty, though they did go on streaks. In a sense, superstitious thought is science interrupted. A relationship is sought and found, but there is a serious lack of follow-through. The conclusions are premature; they are based upon too little information. During the closing seconds of game two of the NBA finals, the Spur's Steven Jackson missed a potentially game-winning three-point shot. He had hit his previous two. One of the commentators, an ex-player who really should understand the game better, proposed that Jackson missed the relatively wide-open shot because a Nets player was rushing at him and \"when someone is coming at you like that, it can throw your shot off.\" There had to be a distinct reason why the shot missed. Maybe, just maybe, Jackson missed that shot because he is a 40% shooter from that distance (give or take 10%). Under the best of circumstances, such as on an empty court while fully concentrating, Jackson will miss shots, for no particular reason. Why? Because a human athlete is imprecise, and this imprecision produces random outcomes. Nothing meaningful can be said about randomness. During that same game, the star player for New Jersey, Jason Kidd, hit his last 6 free throws to \"win the game\" for the Nets. (Why the final points in a game, and not the initial points or middle points, are responsible for a win is another issue.) The still-sweating Kidd was interviewed. \"How did you do it?\" he was asked. Jason replied, \"I knew we had to win this one and there wasn't going to be a second chance.\" So Kidd put his will power into over-drive? Why wouldn't he always give 110%? The answer: because fortuitous sequences eventually come to an end. For a 70% free-throw shooter to hit 6 in a row is not a Herculean feat, as much as fans and announcers would like to view it as such. In game five, Jason Kidd hit his first 4 shots. One commentator concluded that Kidd had definitely brought his \"A\" game. The other concurred: Kidd was \"hot.\" Apparently it is possible to cool off instantly while simultaneously falling into one's \"D\" game. Kidd hit only 1 of his next 9 shots. Both sports commentators had jumped to a premature conclusion. Why do irrational beliefs such as the hot hand persist? Perhaps, in part, because the need persists. It is difficult to project human motives and meaning onto raw numbers such as 50%. But with a sequence such as miss-hit-miss-missmiss- hit-miss-hit-hit-hit, a dramatic story can be told about hot hands and cold chokes. Each event has its story, every turn, a reason.

In this week's eSkeptic, we present an article culled from the archives of [Skeptic magazine Volume 3, Number 1: Pseudomedicine](https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/archives/vol03n01.html). Herein, we reprint the position statement on homeopathy of the National Council Against Health Fraud. More than 15 years since its publication homeopathics are still widely available, reminding skeptics that our jobs are never done. The following article is copyright \u00a9 1994 by the National Council Against Health Fraud, P.O. Box 1276, Loma Linda, CA 92354-1276, fax (909) 824-4838. Permission has been granted for noncommercial electronic circulation of this article in its entirety, including this notice. Homeopathy: A Position Statement by the National Council Against Health Fraud (1994) edited by William Jarvis HOMEOPATHY WAS DEVISED BY THE GERMAN PHYSICIAN SAMUEL HAHNEMANN (1755-1843) as a reaction to practices based upon the ancient humoral theory which he labeled \"allopathy.\" The term has been misapplied to regular medicine ever since. The cardinal principles of homeopathy include that (1) most diseases are caused by an infectious disorder called the psora; (2) life is a spiritual force (vitalism) which directs the body's healing; (3) remedies can be discerned by noting the symptoms that substances produce in overdose (proving), and applying them to conditions with similar symptoms in highly diluted doses (Law of Similia); (4) remedies become more effective with greater dilution (Law of Infinitesimals), and become more dilute when containers are tapped on the heel of the hand or a leather pad (potentizing). Homeopathy's principles have been refuted by the basic sciences of chemistry, physics, pharmacology, and pathology. Homeopathy meets the dictionary definitions of a sect and a cult \u2014 the characteristics of which prevent advances that would change Hahnemann's original principles. Most homeopathic studies are of poor methodological quality, and are subject to bias. Homeopathic product labels do not provide sufficient information to judge their dosages. Although homeopathic remedies are generally thought to be nontoxic due to their high dilutions, some preparations have proved harmful. The ostensible value of homeopathic products can be more than a placebo effect because some products have contained effective amounts of standard medications or have been adulterated. Only about half of the 300 homeopaths listed in the Directory of the National Center for Homeopathy are physicians. Others include naturopaths, chiropractors, acupuncturists, dentists, veterinarians, nurses or physician assistants. Homeopathy's appeal lies in its personal attention to patients. Homeopathy is a magnet for untrustworthy practitioners who pose a threat to public safety. A perverse belief in the \"healing crisis\" causes practitioners to ignore adverse reactions, or to value them as \"toxins being expelled.\" The marketing of homeopathic products and services fits the definition of quackery established by a United States House of Representatives committee which investigated the problem (i.e., the promotion of \"medical schemes or remedies known to be false, or which are unproven, for a profit\"). The United States Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act lists the Homeopathic Pharmacopeia of the United States as a recognized compendium, but this status was due to political influence, not scientific merit. The FDA has not required homeopathic products to meet the efficacy requirements applied to all other drugs, creating an unacceptable double standard for drug marketing. The Federal Trade Commission has not taken action against homeopathic product advertising although it clearly does not meet the standards of truthful advertising generally applied to drugs. Postal authorities have not prosecuted mail-order product promoters that make unproven claims for mail fraud. Three states have established homeopathic licensing boards. Some of these have been administered by medical mavericks with a history of difficulties with former medical licensing boards. Recommendations The NCAHF advises consumers not to buy homeopathic products or to patronize homeopathic practitioners. Basic scientists are urged to be proactive in opposing the marketing of homeopathic remedies because of conflicts with known physical laws. Those who study homeopathic remedies are warned to beware of deceptive practices in addition to applying sound research methodologies. State and federal regulatory agencies are urged to require homeopathic products to meet the same standards as regular drugs, and to take strong enforcement actions against violators, including the discipline of health professionals who practice homeopathy. States are urged to abolish homeopathic licensing boards. Origin Homeopathy (derived from the Greek words homoios \"similar\" and pathos \"suffering\") is a sectarian healing system devised by Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843), a German physician who rejected the harsh medical practices of his era which included bleeding, purging, vomiting and the administration of highly toxic drugs. Practices of the era were based on the ancient Greek humoral theory which attributed disease to an imbalance of four humors (blood, phlegm, and black and yellow bile) and four bodily conditions (hot, cold, wet, and dry) that corresponded to four elements (earth, air, fire, and water). Physicians attempted to balance the humors by treating symptoms with \"opposites.\" For instance, fever (hot) was believed to be due to excess blood because patients were flushed; therefore, balance was sought by blood-letting in order to \"cool\" the patient. Hahnemann dubbed such practices \"allopathy\" (allos \"opposite,\" pathos \"suffering\"), and sought to replace it with his \"Law of Similia\" that treated \"like with like.\" Although medicine never accepted the label of allopathy, homeopaths continue to misrepresent physicians as allopaths to make their differences appear based upon conflicting ideologies rather than scientific pragmatism. Medical writers often refer to medical doctors as \"allopaths\" but their use of the term reflects an alternate definition of allopathy as \"a system of medical practice making use of all measures proved of value (emphasis ours) in treatment of disease\" (Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary). This definition is inconsistent with its root words \"allos\" and \"pathos.\" Its duplicity aids those who wish to misrepresent medicine as ideologically allopathic (i.e., symptom suppression). The Cardinal Principles of Homeopathy The Psora and Vitalism Hahnemann believed that 7/8ths of all diseases are due to an infectious disorder called the Psora (itch). In the words of Hahnemann's \"Organon\": This Psora is the sole true and fundamental cause that produces all the other countless forms of disease, which, under the names of nervous debility, hysteria, hypochondriasis, insanity, melancholy, idiocy, madness, epilepsy, and spasms of all kinds, softening of the bones, or rickets, scoliosis and chophouses, caries, cancer, fungus haematodes, gout-asthma the lungs, megrim, deafness, cataract and amaurosis, paralysis, toss of sense, pains of every kind, etc., appear in our pathology as so many peculiar, distinct, and independent diseases (Stalker, 1985). Hahnemann believed that diseases represent a disturbance in the body's ability to heal itself and that only a small stimulus is needed to begin the healing process. He owed this to his faith in vitalism, which holds that life is a spiritual, nonmaterial process and that the body contains an innate wisdom that is its own healing force. A British homeopath explained its vitalism (Twentyman, 1982): Hahnemann ... is ... a child of the modern age of natural science, an adept in the chemistry of his day ... But he can still hold a conviction that an immaterial vital entity animates our organism until death when the purely chemical forces prevail and decompose it ... .This vital entity which he characterizes as immaterial, spirit-like, and which maintains in health the harmonious wholeness of the organism, is in fact the wholeness of it, can be influenced by dynamic causes. How does Hahnemann attempt to clarify the idea? He draws attention to phenomena like magnetic influences, the moon and the tides, infective illnesses and perhaps most importantly the influence of emotions and impulses of will on the organism (pp. 221-225). Vitalism appeals to so-called \"Holistic\" or \"New Age\" medicine devotees, who prefer a metaphysical view of life processes, and readily accept homeopathy despite its scientific deficiencies. Provings and the Law of Similia Hahnemann's invention of homeopathy is reported to have originated with an experience in which he ingested a substantial dose of cinchona bark (the source of quinine) used to treat malaria. He noted that the symptoms he experienced were similar to those of malaria. He reasoned that since the remedy produced symptoms in overdose similar to the condition it was used to treat, this principle, his Law of Similia, could be used to discern the value of various medicines. He called this process proving a medicine. Promoters often misrepresent homeopathy as treating the \"causes\" rather than merely the \"symptoms\" of disease, but its reliance on the \"proving\" of remedies shows that homeopathy itself relies solely upon a symptom treatment. Hahnemann's Law of Similia utilized the primitive view of monism that \"nature is a unitary, organic whole with no independent parts\" (Webster's) with inherent principles that like is like, like makes like, and like cures like. Monism is the basis of many ancient practices (e.g., eating the heart of a lion for courage), and holds that if one object resembles another they are alike in essence (like is like); idolatry in which carving a likeness of a god actually produces the god (like makes like); and folk medicine practices such as snakeroot being good for snakebite, because of their resemblance (like cures like). Hahnemann revived Paracelsus' Doctrine of Signatures, which declared that herbs would cure conditions or anatomical parts they resembled (Garrison, 1929, p. 206). The homeopathic Law of Similia, however, is unsupported by the basic sciences of physiology, pharmacology and pathology. Law of Infinitesimal \"Potentizing\" Hahnemann's Law of Infinitesimals holds that the smaller the dose of a medication, the more powerful will be its healing effects. He taught that substances could be potentized (i.e., their \"immaterial and spiritual powers\" released to make active substances more active, and inactive substances active). The process of potentizing involved the sequential dilution of remedial agents by succussion in which initial mixtures would be shaken at least 40 times, nine parts dumped, and nine parts of solvent added and shaken again. This process was repeated as many times as desired. Tapping on a leather pad or the heel of the hand was alleged to double the dilution \u2014 a notion that contradicts the laws of physics. Remedies are diluted to powers of ten and labeled with combinations of Arabic and Roman numerals (e.g., 3X= 1/1000, 4X= homeopathic remedies were dilute placebos made them preferable to the harsh concoctions being applied by the humoral practitioners. According to the laws of chemistry, there is a limit to the dilution that can be made without losing the original substance altogether. This limit, called Avogadro's number (6.023 x 10-23) corresponds to 24X (1 part in 1024). At this dilution there is less than a 50% chance that even one molecule of active material remains. Hahnemann himself realized that there was virtually no chance that any of the original substance remained at such high dilution, but explained it away in metaphysical terms. In addition to being contradicted by common sense, homeopathy's Law of Infinitesimals is invalidated by pharmaceutical dose-response studies. Promoters claim that immunization and allergy desensitization verify homeopathy because they treat like with like, but neither meets the additional requirements of homeopathic theory and practice. Immunizations do not alleviate symptoms or cure. Neither immunization nor allergy desensitization grows stronger with dilution, nor can they be \"potentized.\" Classical homeopaths proclaim that eating for relief of indigestion proved that like cures like, i.e., the Law of Similia. However, one does not obtain relief from indigestion by eating \"potentized microdilutions\" of the same food that was originally ingested. Other attempts to validate homeopathy such as the folksy value of \"some of the hair of the dog that bit you\" to relieve a hangover also fail to withstand close scrutiny. Homeopathy and Science Scientific medicine encompasses a collection of procedures, each of which must stand on its own as safe and effective for a specific purpose. History recounts examples of ancient healers doing the right thing for the wrong reason. Some bored holes in skulls (trephining) in order to liberate angry demons thought to be causing head pain, and in the process relieved intracranial pressure. This, however, does not validate the Demonic Theory. Also, foul-smelling swamps were drained on the basis of the miasmic theory, which taught that foul-smelling emanations from the Earth caused \"bad air fever\" (mal-air-ia). Further, Asclepian priests scraped spear shavings into the spear-wounds of warriors believing that the weapon that caused a wound would help in its healing (like-cures-like). Copper sulfate from the bronze spearheads may have inhibited infection. Just as doing these right practices for the wrong reasons did not validate the faulty theories upon which they were based, neither will the success of a \"homeopathic\" remedy comprehensively validate homeopathy's theory, pharmacology, and metaphysics. Homeopathy clearly fits Webster's dictionary definitions of a cult: \"A system for the cure of disease based on dogma set forth by its promulgator,\" and a sect: \"a group adhering to a distinctive doctrine or a leader.\" Healing cults or sects cannot progress and retain their identity. Homeopathy is what Hahnemann said it was. To progress scientifically homeopathy would have to accept principles of pharmacology and pathology, which run counter to its \"law s\" of similia and infinitesimals, its potency theory, and notions of the psora and vitalism. By doing so, it would no longer be homeopathy but biomedicine. Studies of Homeopathy Controlled studies involving homeopathic remedies appear to divide along political lines. While the results of most studies do not support the use of homeopathic remedies, some ostensibly well-designed trials have yielded positive findings. Some of these, however, have been done by homeopaths, and their reports contain rhetoric that reflects bias strong enough to undermine confidence in the researchers' veracity. The best of these studies should be repeated by objective investigators with independent analyses of the homeopathic formulations employed to assure that they have not been adulterated with active medications. A comprehensive review of experimental research in homeopathy was done by Scofield (1984). He concluded: \"It is obvious from this review that, despite much experimental and clinical work, there is only little evidence to suggest that homeopathy is effective. This is because of bad design, execution, reporting, analysis and, particularly, failure to repeat promising experimental work and not necessarily because of the inefficacy of the system which has yet to be properly tested on a large enough scale. There is sufficient evidence to warrant the execution of well-designed, carefully controlled experiments.\" Scofield's most encouraging statement for homeopaths was that \"homeopathy has most certainly not been disproved.\" However, Scofield ignored the scientific process. It is the absence of proof, not the absence of disproof, that is important. This is consistent with scientific dicta (based upon the statistical null hypothesis) that (1) no practice can be deemed safe or effective until proved to be so; and (2) the burden of proof is upon proponents. A more recent meta-analysis of 107 controlled homeopathy trials appearing in 96 published reports also found \"the evidence of clinical trials is positive but not sufficient to draw definitive conclusions because most trials are of low methodological quality and because of the unknown role of publication bias.\" They also concluded that there is a legitimate case for further evaluation of homeopathy, \"but only by means of well-performed trials\" (Kleijnen, 1991). In 1988, a French scientist working at that country's prestigious INSERM institute claimed to have found that high dilutions of substances in water left a \"memory,\" providing a rationale for homeopathy's Law of Infinitesimals. His findings were published in a highly regarded science journal, but with the caveat that the findings were unbelievable, and that the work was financed by a large homeopathic drug manufacturer (Nature, 1988). Subsequent investigations, including those by James Randi, disclosed that the research had been inappropriately carried out. The scandal resulted in the suspension of the scientist. Careful analysis of the study revealed that had the results been authentic, homeopathy would be more likely to worsen a patient's condition than to heal, and that it would be impossible to predict the effect of the same dose from one time to another (Sampson, 1989). The sectarian nature of homeopathy raises serious questions about the trustworthiness of homeopathic researchers. Scofield appropriately stated: \"It is hardly surprising in view of the quality of much of the experimental work as well as its philosophical framework, that this system of medicine is not accepted by the medical and scientific community at large.\" Two guiding rules required by skeptics of pseudoscience should be applied to homeopathic research, to wit: (1) extraordinary claims demand extraordinary evidence; and (2) it is not necessary to prove fraud, rather, the research must be done in such a manner that fraud is not possible. Homeopathic Products Dubious Labeling Recent years have seen an explosion of products labeled as \"homeopathic.\" Among them are raw animal glands, herbal concoctions, and mineral remedies. Although some are reruns of old-time homeopathic preparations, others appear to be merely pretenders with high-dilution their only homeopathic feature. For instance. homeopathic raw bovine testicles may be highly diluted, but in order to be truly homeopathic they should have been \"proved\" and potentized. To have been proved, healthy people should have been fed raw bovine testicles in moderate doses and the side-effects analyzed. Gland products are not representative of the kinds of therapeutic substances homeopaths have traditionally attempted to \"prove,\" and it is unlikely that ingesting significant amounts of raw bovine testicles would produce any side effects. Such products appear to be intended to ward off regulatory enforcement action by merely labeling them \"homeopathic,\" but such products do not meet the basic consumer protection principle of accurate labeling. Standard drug labeling informs consumers about the quantity of active ingredients per dose; homeopathic labeling only informs consumers about the number of serial dilutions of the remedy. Questionable Safety Although homeopathic remedies are generally thought to be nontoxic due to their high dilutions, some preparations have proved to be harmful. Perverse belief in the \"healing crisis\" can cause pseudomedical practitioners to misjudge adverse reactions as beneficial. Healing crisis is the theory that the body innately knows what is best for it. There is a corollary belief that adverse reactions to \"natural remedies\" are due to \"toxins\" being expelled, and that the worse these are, the worse would have been future diseases if not detoxified. Thus, believers are not alarmed by adverse reactions, and are encouraged to continue treating. At the same time, \"allopathic\" medicine is denigrated as the \"suppressing of symptoms that represent the body's natural healing processes.\" Kerr and Yarborough (1986) reported a case of pancreatitis that developed in a patient ingesting a homeopathic remedy prescribed by a chiropractor. According to the authors, the manufacturer stated that 40-45% of persons taking the remedy experienced a healing crisis that included abdominal pain. Although classical homeopathy employed numerous extremely toxic substances in infinitesimal amounts, Kerr found that two of six homeopathic remedies ordered by mail contained \"notable quantities\" of arsenic. NCAHF doubts that homeopathic devotees would systematically report adverse effects. Suspicious Effectiveness Much has been made of the fact that a 24X dilution would no longer contain a single molecule of the original substance, and reported benefits are generally attributed to the placebo effect. However, many homeopathic dosages, although dilute, may contain enough of a substance to be effective. Homeopathic products also may work because of adulteration. Morice (1986, pp. 862-863) reported that a homeopathic remedy called \"Dumcap\" appeared to be effective in treating asthma. Although labeled as containing revealed that the product was adulterated with therapeutic levels of the antiasthma, steroidal drugs prednisolone and betamethasone. Studies of homeopathic deemed unacceptable unless they have been monitored to assure that they were prepared according to homeopathic principles, their contents verified and dosage quantified, and secured to prevent tampering. As was stated above, simply labeling a product \"homeopathic\" does not guarantee that it does not contain a pharmacologically active dosage of an active substance (not all dilutions exceed Avogadro's number). To validate a specific homeopathic remedy, replication by others who have no vested interest in the results is required. To validate homeopathic theory, higher dilutions would also have to be shown to work better than higher concentrations. Thomas Paine, a signer of the United States' Declaration of Independence, is credited with establishing a principle for judging supernatural phenomena. He asked, \"Is it easier to believe that nature has gone out of her course or that a man would tell a lie?\" Homeopathic Services Census The 1993 directory of the National Center for Homeopathy (Alexandria, VA) lists about 300 licensed practitioners. About half of these are physicians. The rest are mostly naturopaths, chiropractors, acupuncturists, veterinarians, dentists, nurses, or physician's assistants. A homeopathic marketing firm spokesperson believes that several hundred more consider themselves to be homeopaths, and that many conventional physicians utilize one or more homeopathic remedies (National Board of Chiropractic Examiners, 1993). However, no data have been published supporting these estimates. In 1991-2, 36.9% of chiropractors reported using homeopathic remedies in their practices. A Haven for Untrustworthy Practitioners Part of homeopathy's appeal is the personal attention paid to patients (Avina and Schneiderman, 1978). In practice, classical homeopaths emphasize taking 30 to 45 minutes with each patient, paying careful attention to the emotional state and administering only one remedy at a time. Classical homeopathy's close personal attention to patients, benign remedies, and special appeal to a select clientele make it seem innocuous if practitioners have the competence and good sense to recognize serious disorders and readily refer to other physicians. This, however, is not always the case. Pseudosciences such as homeopathy, even if relatively benign, are magnets for cranks and charlatans. This poses a serious problem because untrustworthy or incompetent practitioners should not be granted the privilege of administering health care. True believing cranks may pose a more serious threat than con men because of their devotion to homeopathy's ideology. Their sincerity may make them more socially tolerable, but it can add to their potential danger. Irrational health care is never harmless, and it is irresponsible to create patient confidence in pseudomedicine. Although homeopathy may not pose a significant risk for a basically healthy patient, at some future time that same patient could face a situation where a life-or-death decision may swing on just such unwarranted confidence. Some practitioners do not practice in homeopathy's classical manner, but use its \"benign\" reputation as a cover. A well-documented example occurred in Nevada. According to an expose by the Las Vegas Review-Journal, several maverick MDs who had been in serious legal difficulty in other states descended on Nevada and managed to get the State Legislature to set up a homeopathic licensing board with themselves in charge. However, none was actually practicing homeopathy. Rather, using an unapproved electronic device they practiced \"energy medicine.\" When faced with the fact that they had deceived the State Legislature, proponents stated that they had used the more familiar term \"homeopathy\" because they feared that the legislators would not be able to grasp the new concept of \"bioenergetics.\" The Nevada legislature rewrote the homeopathic practice act in 1987, specifically stating that Nevada homeopaths were limited to using substances prepared according to \"the methods of Hahnemannian dilution and succussion, magnetically energized geometric pattern as defined in the official homeopathic pharmacopeia of the United States\" (Hayslett, 1987). It is difficult to believe that a physician could simultaneously sustain confidence in both homeopathy and scientific health care. It is common for homeopaths to misrepresent regular medicine as misguided to justify their unusual practices. Of special concern to NCAHF is the substitution of homeopathic preparations for standard immunizations. In 1989, an Idaho naturopath was prosecuted for selling homeopathic \"immunization kits,\" which contained alcohol-and-water solutions and sugar pills. Defenders claimed that the homeopathic immunization products would \"stimulate the immune system;\" and that the FDA laboratory could not detect the active ingredients because they were so highly diluted with sugar. Quackery NCAHF is primarily concerned with homeopathy in the marketplace. It believes that marketing unproven homeopathic products and services precisely fits the definition of quackery: \"A quack is anyone who promotes medical schemes or remedies known to be false, or which are unproven, for a profit'' (Quackery, 1984). Dr. Kenneth Milstead, then Deputy Director of the FDA Bureau of Enforcement, stated (Young, 1968): It matters not whether the article is harmless or whether it gives some psychosomatic relief; whether it is cheap or whether it has value for other purposes; whether it is produced by an obscure firm or whether it is produced by a \"reputable\" firm \u2014 the promotion of it is still quackery. Regulators Fiddle While Consumers Are Burned Federal Regulation For many years homeopathic product marketing was quiescent, but with the health fad boom of the 1970s and 1980s, promoters began touting homeopathic remedies. In 1985 the FDA estimated that between 50 and 60 companies were marketing such products in the United States (FDA, 1985). The 1938 Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act contains a section that recognizes as \"drugs\" items listed in the Homeopathic Pharmacopeia of the United States. This was mainly due to the efforts of New York Senator Royal Copeland who was the foremost homeopathic physician of his day. In 1938, safety was the main issue, and the highly diluted homeopathic products seemed to pose no inherent danger. However, in 1962, the Kefauver-Harris Amendment was passed requiring that drugs be proved effective before distribution. A legal fight loomed as to whether or not homeopathic drugs were grandfathered by the law, but FDA did not press the issue. Instead, it permitted products aimed at common ailments to be marketed over-the-counter (OTC), and restricted those aimed at serious ailments to prescription only. This \"passed the buck\" to the states that regulate the practitioners who write the prescriptions, putting consumers at the mercy of maverick homeopathic physicians. It also sent a signal to marketers that it was open season on consumers with regard to OTC homeopathic products. The resulting marketplace growth increased the ability of trade groups to gain political support and made future regulatory action more difficult. Homeopathic claims of efficacy are unsubstantiated and violate the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) advertising standards, but the FTC has not acted against homeopathic advertising claims. Homeopathic remedies sold or transported by mail are subject to action by the U.S. Postal Inspectors, but few such actions have been taken. State Regulation Only Arizona, Connecticut, and Nevada have separate homeopathic licensing boards. At least two of these have included in prominent roles maverick medical doctors who have been in legal difficulties as regular physicians. Some state licensing boards permit licensed medical doctors to practice almost any kind of medicine they wish. Others, rightly in NCAHF's opinion, require that health care be held to rational and responsible standards. To its credit, the North Carolina Board of Medical Examiners revoked the license of the state's only practicing homeopath, concluding that he was \"failing to conform to the standards of acceptable and prevailing medical practice.\" This resulted in a prolonged legal battle over the ability of a licensing board to impose standards of practice on its constituency. The state legislature eventually passed a law that limited the board's disciplinary power undermining the consumer protection aspects of responsible medicine.

Recommendations To Consumers Be aware that homeopathic products and services are marketed in a \"buyer beware\" situation at present. Homeopathic products are not required to meet the standards of effectiveness of drugs. Homeopathic services are poorly regulated. Physicians who practice homeopathy operate below the standards of responsible medicine. Some have backgrounds that raise serious questions about their honesty. Be aware that in some states that have homeopathic licensing boards the \"foxes are guarding the chicken coops.\" Consumers should not entrust their health to physicians or nonphysicians who practice homeopathy. To Basic Scientists Homeopathy conflicts more with basic laws of physics, chemistry and pharmacology than with clinical medicine. Pharmacologists should be more proactive in opposing the marketing of homeopathic remedies. Because homeopathic theories contradict known physical laws, tests of homeopathic remedies require controls beyond those normally required of double-blind clinical trials including additional measures to show that fraud was not possible. To the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (1) Require that labels of homeopathic products indicate the precise amounts of ingredients in milligrams, micrograms, etc. (2) Require homeopathic products to meet the efficacy standards of all other drugs. To the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (1) Review advertising of homeopathic products in publications aimed at the public for false and misleading claims. (2) Monitor and take action against advertisements in trade publications used to indoctrinate salespeople, who will in turn deceive consumers about the value of homeopathic products. To U.S. Postal Inspectors Prosecute distributors of homeopathic mail-order products that make unproven medical claims for mail fraud. To State Legislators Because homeopathy is scientifically indefensible: (1) Enact laws requiring that medical products sold within your state meet the standards of accurate labeling, truthful advertising, and premarketing proof of safety and effectiveness. (2) Abolish state licensing boards for homeopathy. (3) Do not allow homeopathy in the scope of practice of any health care provider. To State Food & Drug Regulators Take prompt regulatory action against manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers of homeopathic products who violate the law. To Medical Licensing Boards (1) Discipline homeopathic practitioners for unprofessional conduct. (2) Prosecute nonphysicians engaging in homeopathy for practicing medicine without a license. Because homeopathy is scientifically indefensible: (1) Enact laws requiring that medical products sold within your state meet the standards of accurate labeling, truthful advertising, and premarketing proof of safety and effectiveness. (2) Abolish state licensing boards for homeopathy. (3) Do not allow homeopathy in the scope of practice of any health care provider. About the NCAHF The National Council Against Health Fraud is a private nonprofit, voluntary health agency that focuses upon health misinformation, fraud and quackery as public health problems. Its funding is derived primarily from membership dues and newsletter subscriptions. NCAHF unites consumers with health professionals, educators, researchers, attorneys, and others who believe that everyone has a stake in the quality of the health marketplace. NCAHF's positions on consumer health issues are based upon principles of science that form the basis of consumer protection law. These require: (1) full disclosure in labeling and other warranties (no secret formulas); (2) premarketing proof of safety and efficacy for products and services that claim to prevent, alleviate, or cure any disease or disorder; and (3) accountability for those who violate consumer laws. Its officers and board members serve without compensation. For more information, write: NCAHF, P.O. Box Avina, Schneiderman. 1978. West J Med. 128:366-9. - Barrett, Jarvis. 1993. The Health Robbers.

In this week's eSkeptic, Dr. Jeremy E.C. Genovese examines an educational urban legend that suggests a willingness to accept assertions about instructional strategies without empirical support. This article appeared in a SOLD OUT issue of [Skeptic magazine Volume 10 Number 4 (2004)](https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/archives/vol10n04.html). Dr. Genovese is an assistant professor of human development and educational psychology at the College of Education at Cleveland State University. He has a PhD in learning and development from Cleveland State University and a master's in biological anthropology from Kent State University. His research interests include individual differences in learning and cognitive style and the application of evolutionary psychology to education. His paper [\"Piaget, Pedagogy, and Evolutionary Psychology\"](http://www.epjournal.net/filestore/ep01127137.pdf) was published in the online journal Evolutionary Psychology. The Ten Percent Solution Anatomy of an Education Myth by Dr. Jeremy E.C. Genovese FOR MANY YEARS, VERSIONS OF A CLAIM that students remember \"10% of what they read, 20% of what they hear, 30% of what they see, 50% of what they see and hear, and 90% of what they do\" have been widely circulated among educators. The source of this claim, however, is unknown and its validity is questionable. It is an educational urban legend that suggests a willingness to accept assertions about instructional strategies without empirical support. The Claim In a popular book on children with ADHD, the author makes the following claim: According to statistics, students retain: - 10% of what they read; - 26% of what they hear; - 30% of what they see; - 50% of what see and hear; - 70% of what they say; and - 90% of what they say and do.\" [1] The claim is startling. Any instructional method that could deliver on a promise of 90% retention would revolutionize education. Moreover the claim is framed with impressive exactitude. The reader would like to know more but, alas, no source is given other than \"statistics.\" The figures are passed along like memes. A book on accelerated learning, for example, claims: It has been said that on average, we remember: - 20% of what we read - 30% of what we hear - 40% of what we see - 50% of what we say - 60% of what we do - 90% of what we see, hear, say, and do\" [2] But no source is acknowledged and no evidence is given. A slightly different version of the claim is presented in a recent issue of the Stanford Business Review: \"Some research on learning indicates that we may retain only about 10% of what we read, maybe 20% of what we see and hear in a lecture, and perhaps 80% of what we experience personally. Learning may increase even more to the extent that we take what we have experienced, put it into our own words, and then explain it to others.\" [3](#note03) But just what is this research and who conducted it? On this point the article is silent. An Internet search reveals dozens of versions of this claim. While they are all essentially similar, they often differ in the specific percentages they assign to the various instructional modalities. For example \"20% of what they read\" is far more common than \"26% of what they read.\" Some versions add the final claim that students retain \"95% of what they teach to someone else.\" What is the origin of this claim and why have educators accepted it uncritically? The Source To date, all efforts to locate the source of this claim have failed because all trails have led to dead ends. For example, a 1988 paper by Felder and Silverman repeats the claim and cites a 1987 paper by Stice as their source. [4](#note04) The Stice paper in turn speaks of \"some data from the old Socony-Vacuum Oil Company. (The source indicates the data are from the 1930s or 1940s, but I have no other information).\" [5](#note05) A 1997 paper by Lee and Bowers, however, sets out on an alternative trail. These authors indirectly cite White (sic) from a 1992 paper by Hapeshi and Jones. [6](#note06) The passage in Hapeshi and Jones actually reads: Bayard-White (1990) quotes the British Audio Visual Society, which claimed that we remember about: - 10% of what we read - 20% of what we hear - 30% of what we see - 50% of what we see and hear - 80% of what we say - 90% of what we say and do at the same time The evidence for these statements is not given...\" [7] Thus Lee and Bowers cited Hapeshi and Jones, who in turn cited Bayard-White who, they acknowledge, had no evidence for the claim. An Internet search for the \"British Audio Visual Society\" yielded a total of 9 hits, all of them repeating the claim and citing this organization as its source. But no record of the existence of a British Audio Visual Society has been found. It appears that once a claim has been published subsequent authors do not bother much about the actual supporting evidence. A third source frequently cited for the claim is Edgar Dale. In fact, many on-line versions label the claim \"Dale's Cone of Experience,\" or \"Dale's Cone of Learning.\" In his 1946 book, Audio Visual Methods in Teaching, Dale did present a concept called the \"Cone of Experience.\" described as \"merely a visual aid to explain the interrelationship of the various types of audio-visual materials, as well as their individual positions in the learning process.\" [8](#note08) In the 1969 edition of Audio Visual Methods in Teaching Dale tells us: In addition, we have suggested the narrowing upward shape of the Cone does not imply an increasing difficulty of learning. Both verbal and visual symbols are used by little children. Demonstrations may be complex and quite involved \u2014 much more so than a map (a visual symbol) of Alaska. The basis of the classification is not difficulty but degree of abstraction \u2014 the amount of immediate sensory participation that is involved. Thus, a still photograph of a tree is not more difficult to understand than the dramatization of Hamlet. It is simply in itself a less concrete teaching material than the dramatization. [9] Dale's Cone is really a classification of audiovisual material on a scale of abstractness and bears only slight resemblance to the claim. Indeed, it could be argued that Dale's Cone presents a much more complex model that is trivialized when associated with the claim. All citations of Dale as the source of the claim are simply mistaken. The Truth I was only able to locate one paper that explicitly tested the claim, the research by Lee and Bowers who found: These results do not support White's(sic) percentages for the contribution of the different components of multimedia (as quoted in Hapeshi & Jones, 1992). For example, audio did not have a larger impact on learning than text, nor did graphics and animation alone have a larger impact than audio (unless one is comparing \"what we see\" as text and graphics together. Actually, audio had much less of an impact and audio plus graphics and text plus graphics had an equivalent impact. [10] Nor does the claim agree with other empirical studies of the relative effectiveness of various teaching techniques. [11](#note11) The Meaning In his investigation of the myth that people use only 10% of their brains, Barry Beyerstein noted a similarity to urban legends because \"attempts to verify them invariably lead to an infinite regress.\" He also argued that there is a connection between numerology and the 10% brain myth: \"I suspect that the lucky choice of the number 10 for the denominator in our fictitious fraction has served to enhance the attractiveness of the one-tenth myth. Among magical thinkers, numerology \u2014 the belief in the magical power of numbers \u2014 is rarely far from the surface, and 10 is a perennial favorite in this camp. Probably because nature equipped us with 10 fingers and 10 toes, our ancestors developed a primitive reverence for them.\" [12](#note12) Beyerstein goes on to give examples of how arbitrary increments of 10 are often given special significance such as the Ten Commandments, the 10 best dressed list, and the characterization of historical periods in terms of decades. The educational claim investigated in this paper is typically framed in increments of 10, and thus fits neatly into this pattern. A recent paper by Simkin and Roychowdhury estimated that a large percentage of authors do not actually read the papers they cite. [13](#note13) As worrisome as their findings are, the multiple iterations of the claim reveal an even more distressing pattern. Not only do people often fail to read the research they cite, they sometimes fail to see if the research was ever actually conducted! Above all this suggests a staggering lack of curiosity and a willingness to accept findings that agree with superficial preconceptions. Perhaps the real world effects of the claim examined here are relatively benign. After all, who would quarrel with the idea that instructors need to use a variety of teaching techniques? But the larger implication is troubling. Instructional techniques affect real children, and educators have a responsibility to ground their practice in actual research, not unsupportable clich\u00e9s.

Meanwhile, the conservative majority of the Texas State Board of Education (whose sheer size and buying power influence textbook content nationwide) revised its curricula to reflect a less secular version of history, economics and sociology. Among other revisionist changes, this reduces the role of President Thomas Jefferson as a revolutionary author. This week on Skepticality, Swoopy talks with Sean Faircloth (the new Executive Director of the Secular Coalition for America) about these troubling current events.

Kenneth Grubbs is a freelance writer living in Michigan. Is There Not Grandeur in this View? book reviews by Kenneth Grubbs \"ONE OF THE CONDITIONS OF ENLIGHTENMENT has always been a willingness to let go of what we thought we knew in order to appreciate truths we had never dreamed of.\" Does this compelling passage originate from Karen Armstrong's newest release, The Case for God, or did Richards Dawkins pen these words in his most recent achievement, The Greatest Show on Earth? Read on to find out. Karen Armstrong once steeped herself for seven isolating years in the confines of a strict Catholic Order in England. She resigned the Order in 1969 shortly before suffering a collapse and the eventual diagnosis of epilepsy. But in spite of being soured to the rigors of modern Christian doctrine, Armstrong's spirituality has nevertheless grown, both in scope and diversity. This latest offering, The Case for God, is an epic historical journey interpreting the rise and fall of humanity's perceptions of God. The author's personal perspective lends weight and insight to her words. She begins by asking the reader to understand that pre-modern religion originated as an action, not as a belief. She writes, \"Religion, therefore was not primarily something that people thought but something they did. Its truth was acquired by practical action.\" Armstrong goes on to explain that most pre-modern cultures came to recognize two distinct ways of thinking \u2014 the Greeks called them mythos and logos. \"Logos (reason), was the pragmatic mode of thought,\" but for understanding human suffering or the ultimate meaning of life, \"people turned to mythos (myth, meaningful stories).\" Spiritual transcendence was a process wherein one arrives at a place beyond words or thought, a state of \"unknowing,\" or ekstasis. Armstrong tells us that even early Christianity was to be, \"imparted in a ritualized setting to people who were properly prepared and were eager to be transformed by it.\" It wasn't until the 4th century that, \"Christianity had begun to move in a slightly different direction and developed a preoccupation with doctrinal correctness that would become its Achilles' heel.\" During the 7th century many Greek philosophers began to consider a more materialistic view of the world. They grew interested in sailing, astronomy, mathematics, and geography. \"They wanted to show that thunderbolts and lightning were not arbitrary whims of Zeus, but expressions of fundamental physical laws,\" Armstrong explains. Philosophers and theologians began to apply reason to the truths of faith; a methodology that Armstrong suggests would eventually lead to their undoing. Centuries later, discoveries in mathematics, astronomy, and physics \u2014 by Copernicus, Kepler, and Brahe \u2014 were still being viewed through the lens of God. Kepler believed that \"Geometry was God's language.\" Other great minds of the 17th and 18th centuries \u2014 the likes of Galileo and Newton \u2014 continued to mold scientific discoveries from the clay of divinity. Philosopher and theologian alike were determined to embody the new sciences as the work of God. Armstrong walks the reader through the influences of Descartes, Pascal, and Locke; men who also found that \"the natural world gave ample evidence for God.\" She quotes Pascal stating, \"Christianity was about to make a serious mistake.\" Many theologians wanted to bring the clarity of the sciences into the Christian discourse, but as Pascal pointed out, \"A God who was merely the 'author of mathematical truths and of the order of the elements' could bring no light to the darkness and pain of human existence.\" The Church would find itself in the unenviable position of defending the literal inerrancy of its texts and doctrines. The sacred mythos and ekstasi of antiquity were fading. By the late 18th century, \"Reason was the only path to truth.\" Armstrong tells us that for the first time there arose a divisive \"polarity of natural versus supernatural.\" With such tumult came vulnerability. The stage was now set. In November, 1859, Charles Darwin published The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection. Enter Richard Dawkins, the well-known evolutionary biologist and author of many ground-breaking works of science. His latest offering, The Greatest Show on Earth, is for Dawkins a well-deserved return to his roots. Far from the full-frontal assault on religion and belief in God found in The God Delusion, this new work is instead an updated exploration of the evidence confirming evolution by natural selection. Dawkins begins profoundly confident, \"We don't need fossils, the case for evolution is watertight without them.\" Which is why, he continues, \"it is paradoxical to use gaps in the fossil record as though they were evidence against evolution.\" The Greatest Show on Earth is a delicious buffet of evolutionary facts. Among them is the remarkable tale of whales and dolphins. As fascinating as it is that evolution began selecting for adaptations that would bring the ancestors of these creatures ashore during the Ordovician Period, (510-439 mya), it is even more fascinating that some of these land mammals evolved back to the sea! Before molecular genetics, the whale and dolphin family tree remained enigmatic. The nature of these peaceful sea dwellers likened them to mammals, with live births, air breathing, and vestiges of terrestrial limbs. However, as Dawkins explains, \"molecular genetic evidence shows that the closest living cousins of the whales are hippos,\" which evolved from sea, to land, to sea again. In another remarkable story, Dawkins untangles the recurrent laryngeal nerves. Two of the many cranial nerves begin at the cranial stem and head toward their final destination in the larynx. One of them, as we would expect, takes the short direct route. The other takes a seemingly ludicrous excursion south, through the chest cavity, below the heart, makes a u-turn, and comes right back up to terminate at the larynx. Dawkins can't help but remark, \"If you think of it as the product of design, the recurrent laryngeal nerve is a disgrace.\" If however one examines this phenomenon with evolutionary eyes, we learn that our aquatic ancestor's embryonic brachial arches formed gills as well as the ventral aorta. As these features evolved, the connections were maneuvered to facilitate new features. Instead of altering the laryngeal nerve path to a more direct route (thereby avoiding disgrace), it was pushed aside during the transition and there it remained. What we're left with today is our own comically circuitous laryngeal nerve route. The laryngeal nerve is an example of history, not design. Dawkins' excitement for these evolutionary narratives is at its peak with his impassioned explanation of the crucial Lenski experiments. Bacteriologist Richard Lenski and his colleagues at Michigan State University have been conducting experiments that are a \"beautiful demonstration of evolution in action.\" Beginning in 1988, the Lenski team has followed the evolutionary lineages of 12 separate populations of the bacterium Escherichia coli. For bacteria, generations are measured in hours or even minutes, making them the perfect organism for evolutionary studies. These generational flasks of E coli also contain a carefully controlled brew of nutrients, primarily glucose, providing researchers the ability to tinker with the population's capacity to process its food. Right around 33,000 generations, one of the 12 lineages suddenly exploded in population density by more than six fold over the other 11 lineages. To use Dawkins' own vernacular, this one lineage \"suddenly went berserk.\" This sudden dramatic growth was astonishing, and the explanation for it is breathtaking. Although the \"broth\" in each flask was primarily glucose, it contained other nutrients as well, one of which was citrate. But E. coli cannot process citrate as food, unless it mutates, which is exactly what it did. It changed the rules. It developed the ability to eat citrate. It evolved. This lineage, from so simple a beginning, had had enough of the restricted glucose diet, and figured out how to eat citrate! Dawkins continues with more ineffable examples of evolution in action. Trees grow constantly taller at enormous evolutionary cost in their competitive fight for sunlight. Ichneumon wasps lay their eggs in the paralyzed yet still living bodies of caterpillars so that the new larvae have instant access to a sustainable food supply. (An inconceivably torturous methodology no compassionate designer would employ). The Greatest Show on Earth is a straightforward and inspiring exegesis of evolution by means of natural selection. It is by no means overtly anti-creation. Dawkins does not rail against the book of Genesis. He doesn't need to. He need only explain Darwin's theory of incremental steps trudging mindlessly through time. Yet the theory of evolution is more than that. Darwin's revelation imparted something well beyond common ancestry and natural selection. He wrenched darkness from our eyes to illuminate a process of thought, an entirely new way of thinking about the world around us. There is a greater truth in the knowledge and understanding of evolutionary theory than there is in evolution alone. Karen Armstrong writes with subtle sorrow for the lost mythos of antiquity, for the Ancient Mysteries, for the Pythagorean initiations, and for the Greek ekstasis. She shuns the modern anthropomorphic God of Creation and rejects the notion of inerrant religious texts. She writes, \"The result is that many of us have been left stranded with an incoherent concept of God.\" The reader senses her longing for a deeper more transcendent truth, for mankind's earliest experience with the divine before the spiritually narrowing notion of a supernatural Creator. She admires the ancient philosophies and the concept of connectedness. Of Aristotle she writes, \"His biological research was a spiritual exercise.\" Although Armstrong still clings to the occasional supernatural supposition, she passionately embraces a rich and fulfilling idea of oneness with nature and the universe. At the same time, Richard Dawkins teaches us that all life evolved from the simplest forms and shares genetic ancestry with every other living thing from apes and birds to insects and oak trees, an ancestry shared with life forms extinct for a billion years. There is most assuredly a deep sense of the unmistakable connectedness through all of life in his narrative. Is there any room then to consider that these two authors are perhaps speaking of something far more similar than we may have first thought? Do the simple and graceful facts of The Greatest Show on Earth in any subtle way connect the dots to a more transcendent truth, to a kind of ekstasis from pre-modern philosophies that Armstrong yearns for in The Case for God? \"One of the conditions of enlightenment has always been a willingness to let go of what we thought we knew in order to appreciate truths we had never dreamed of.\" Yes, those words come from Armstrong, not Dawkins. If we pause for only a moment to consider, among other things, the sprinkling of heavy dust from long forgotten supernova resting gently within us; if we consider quantum entanglement, singularities and super strings; and if we consider the quiet genetic code of ancestors extinct for a billion years still written in our hundred trillion cells; does it not seem, as Socrates might have phrased it, that no matter how much we think we know, there actually is a more transcendent truth? Is there not grandeur in this view?
