REGISTER REGISTER REGISTER REGISTER REGISTER Researcher Spotlight Saria Hassan Assistant Professor - General Medicine - Primary Care What is your professional background? Originally from the Sudan, I came to the US in 1997 for my undergraduate studies at the Massachusetts Institute for Technology in Boston, MA. My original thoughts of going into genetic engineering were overtaken by a desire to become a physician. I graduated from Harvard Medical School in 2006 and went to Yale for residency training i n Adult Medicine and Pediatrics. After completing my training at Yale, I worked at a Federally Qualified Health Center in New Haven, CT serving uninsured, underinsured, refugee, and immigrant populations. This kindled a passion to address health disparitie s which led me to pursue a research career. I was introduced to the field of implementation science while working in Tanzania and that now drives my approach to research. I moved to Atlanta and Emory in the summer of 2020. In what division do you work, and who is your mentor? I have a joint appointment at the Emory University School of Medicine and at the Rollins School of Public Health. While most of my time is in research, my clinical time is at Midtown General Internal Medicine clinic with the amazing t eam of physicians and residents there. My research mentor is Dr. Venkat Narayan at the Emory Rollins School of Public Health. Briefly describe your research. Why is it important? I am an implementation scientist with an interest in applying implementation science tools to address cardiovascular risk disparities in the US and world -wide. Much of my work is in the Caribbean addressing the large burden of diabetes among Caribbean and Caribbean -descent individuals as well as territorial health disparities with work in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. Using a similar program of care to that of Dr. Narayan in India, we implemented a diabetes prevention intervention across four islands in the Caribbean. In 2017 we saw hurricanes cause utter destruction and de vastation to the lives of our friends, colleagues, and participants. This led me to re -focus my efforts to understand how we can reduce morbidity and mortality due to chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart failure during natural disaste rs. With at least 30% of deaths after hurricanes Irma and Maria due to poorly controlled chronic diseases, this work is important for many individuals world -wide who will only see an increase in the severity of natural disasters in the years to come. What do you like most about Emory? I like that it is in Atlanta, which is much warmer than New Haven, CT. I like the emphasis that Emory places on the importance of a multi -disciplinary and inter -disciplinary team approach to research. What is your favorite movie or TV show? My favorite movie is Hamilton. What do you like to do in your spare time? In my spare time, I take my kids out hiking on one of the many beautiful trails in the greater Atlanta area. What is a fun fact about you? Fun fact about me is that I have lived in 6 different countries throughout my life. \"What's Up\" is brought to you by Emory University's Department of Medicine. "}
