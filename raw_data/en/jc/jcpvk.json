We used it to jolt us awake and keep us going through long days. Before we knew it, we were each downing 5-6 cups a day without hesitation. Our coffee consumption became a dependency that actually made us anxious and unsettled. Stomach pains and headaches were a daily reality. This habit was slowly making us unhealthy, unhappy, and unmotivated. We knew we needed better, and so we made it.

Q & A HOW MUCH CAFFEINE IS IN THE PRODUCT? ARE THERE ANY ADDITIVES OR SWEETENERS? Absolutely none. CAN YOU CONSUME WHILE PREGNANT OR BREASTFEEDING? While it is perfectly safe to consume our product during pregnancy or while breastfeeding, we always recommend consulting with your physician before repeated use. WHEN IS THE BEST TIME TO CONSUME RYZE? We may be biased because we like to drink RYZE all day long. However, we recommend it first thing in the morning to get your energy levels up, your focus turned ON, and your happiness at an all time high. It's the perfect way to start the day. It also works amazing as an afternoon-pick-me-up. Not at all harsh like coffee, its calm energy takes you smoothly right into the evening hours. WHERE DO YOU SHIP? We currently ship domestically in the US only. We are working on expanding our shipping options as soon as possible to offer RYZE to mushroom coffee fans worldwide. WHERE IS IT MADE? Our company is based in Boston, MA, but our organic mushrooms are sustainably grown in California. The other ingredients are sourced from the best suppliers in the country, being thoroughly tested for mycotoxins and heavy metals. We ship from our warehouse in Texas straight to your front door. WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MUSHROOM MATCHA AND REGULAR MATCHA? Benefits. Benefits. Benefits. Our matcha blend includes only the finest ingredients. For our matcha, we use ceremonial-grade, nutrient-dense plants that have been natively growing in Japan for hundreds of years. You can expect a plethora of health benefits including calmer, sharper focus, no jitters, sustained energy without the crash, immune support, gut health and a calm digestive tract. In addition, functional mushrooms offer benefits to optimize body and brain function due to them being antioxidants, anti-virals, and anti-microbials. ARE FUNCTIONAL MUSHROOMS THE SAME AS MAGIC MUSHROOMS? WILL THEY MAKE ME TRIP? While we think the mushrooms in our blend are perfectly magical due to their health benefits, no they are not psychedelic or magic mushrooms and they will not make you trip. With over 10,000 species of mushrooms out there, medicinal (or functional mushrooms) are distinct from magic and have absolutely no psychedelic effects whatsoever. ARE YOU CERTIFIED GLUTEN-FREE? VEGAN? We are currently working on getting certified gluten-free and vegan but we can absolutely assure you that all of our ingredients are gluten-free and vegan. ARE YOU ORGANIC? Yes! All of our ingredients are 100% organic. HOW SHOULD I USE IT? RYZE is a ready to drink beverage. Stir 1 tbsp into 8-10 oz. of hot water or use a mini-frother to make it extra foamy and frothy! Nut and non-dairy milks blend very nicely for an even creamier texture, although it's plenty creamy already. Add natural sweeteners to taste. HOW MUCH CAFFEINE IS IN THE PRODUCT? A cup of our mushroom matcha contains about 30mg of caffeine, equivalent to 1/3 the amount that's in a regular cup of coffee. To sustain energy naturally and get rid of the jitters, we look to Matcha and Cordyceps, not caffeine. ARE THERE ANY ADDITIVES OR SWEETENERS? Absolutely none.
