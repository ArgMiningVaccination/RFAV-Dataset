Ayurvedic Acupuncture (also known as Marmacupuncture) makes use of acupuncture needles that penetrates the skin at particular acupoints to balance the Prana (life force) of internal body environment (microcosm) with that of external world(macrocosm) for bringing about a balance or health. The needles used could be normal or medicated. History: Ayurvedic Acupuncture was practiced in ancient days as a global system, using needle-like blow darts at various points in the body, often making use of herbs by dipping the needle point into the herb liquid, for curing diseases. Ayurvedic Acupuncture was even taught as a subject in major universities of ancient India. Today, Ayurvedic Acupuncture is again gaining popularity and is considered \"an open and endless science\". Method: Ayurvedic Acupuncture cures by stimulating the body to heal rather than treating the disease by itself, when that particular marma is gently needled. The marmas are responsible for connecting the various systems in the body with their internal organs through a series of ducts called 'Nadis'. They carry 'prana' to each marma. Ayurvedic Acupuncture aims to balance all levels of the Self, and not just the physical level. This principle is termed as Akashic Balancing or Etheric Balancing, where the marmas are used to assist the body in balancing its own bio-computer to achieve homeostasis. Hence in this Akashic balancing the physical body is first treated by needling appropriate points based on the aggravated dosha (humour), and the unbalanced elements of the individual. When the patient responds positively to one or several such treatments, the Astral Body (Sukshma sharira) is then treated using Ayurvedic Acupuncture by working on astral levels such as nadis or chakras and the emotions. Once the astral and physical bodies have responded positively, the patient will have improved health and total body balance (both at physical and psychological levels). "}
