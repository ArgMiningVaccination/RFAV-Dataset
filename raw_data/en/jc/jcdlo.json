Increased blood circulation to the face moistens the skin and promotes collagen production for increased muscle tone and elasticity. From a Western medicine perspective, it is thought that the needling creates production of more collagen and elastin in the face, while encouraging the regeneration of skin cells. Cosmetic acupuncture is also effective for acne and other skin conditions. I combine constitutional acupuncture with cosmetic acupuncture. In addition to acupuncture, I also incorporate aromatherapy with organic facial treatments. Treatments can also include facial cupping, jade gua sha and jade rollers depending on what fits best with your skin type. I use 100% pure organic ISUN products for my facials. 'wild-crafted and natural sustainable plant-life in advanced bio-active skincare that harmonizes nature, science, energy, wisdom and pure intention. for the purpose of restoring, rejuvenating and giving pure vitality to one's skin, senses, health and total well-being.' Enhanced treatments can be booked to address stretch marks and scarring both of which are treated effectively with acupuncture. Treating the whole body along with local areas on the face produce glowing effects inside and out. These treatments are recommended to be completed weekly, in a series of 12 consecutive treatments and returning once or twice yearly for follow will provide the most lasting results. However, if you decide to come monthly or just to try it one time, you will still see great results. [Make "}
