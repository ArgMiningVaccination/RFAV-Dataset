ALL KINDERGARTEN WHNAU WELCOME Tuesday 30 November, 7pm The 12 Senses: Pathways to Restoring Balance in the Nervous System Join Julie Frew and George Rhynd for a session to explore: - the picture of the 12 senses as conceived by Rudolf Steiner - how contemporary neuroscience maps onto this picture - how balance in the nervous system is key to health and wellbeing for us and our children - how 'listening' to what is happening inside, outside and between us and others impacts our sense of safety - how all of this invites compassion - toward ourselves, our children, and each other Julie will speak briefly to the picture of the senses and the connections with trauma-informed principles - how our environments and relationships to self and others can support nervous system health and resilience for us, our children and our communities. We will then explore grounding practises through the senses (for varied age/stages), in particular the inner/body senses as pathways to regulation, reducing stress, anxiety or overwhelm. This will be followed by discussion/question time. Please wear comfortable clothing that you can move in. You can explore the practises as much or as little as you like. The invitations are designed with varied dispositions and neurotypes in mind, you can choose the ones/options you feel a sense of ease with. Julie and George are both Occupational Therapists and study with Robyn Ritchie. Both have children in our school.
