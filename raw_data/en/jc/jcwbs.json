Seventeen papers were translated from Russian. Fourteen RCTs and 11 cohort studies were included in the analysis of vaccine efficacy and effectiveness. From RCTs, live vaccines showed an efficacy of 79% (95% confidence interval (CI) 48% to 92%) and an effectiveness of 33% (95% CI 28% to 38%) in children older than two years compared with placebo or no intervention. Inactivated vaccines had a lower efficacy of 59% (95% CI 41% to 71%) than live effectiveness: 36% (95% CI 24% to 46%). In children under two, the efficacy of inactivated vaccine was similar to placebo. Thirty-four reports containing safety outcomes were included, 22 including live vaccines, 8 inactivated vaccines and 4 both types. The most commonly presented short-term outcomes were temperature and local reactions. The variability in design of studies and presentation of data was such that meta-analysis of safety outcome data was not feasible.Fifty-one studies involving 263,987 children were included.

There was a marked difference between vaccine efficacy and effectiveness. That no safety comparisons could be carried out emphasizes the need for standardisation of methods and presentation of vaccine safety data in future studies. It was surprising to find only one study of inactivated vaccine in children under two years, given recent recommendations to vaccinate healthy children from six months old in the USA and Canada. If immunisation in children is to be recommended as public-health policy, large-scale studies assessing important outcomes and directly comparing vaccine types are urgently required.Influenza vaccines are efficacious in children older than two years but little evidence is available for children under two.

Nasal spray vaccines made from weakened influenza viruses, were better at preventing illness caused by the influenza virus than injected vaccines made from killed virus. Neither type was particularly good at preventing 'flu-like illness' caused by other types of viruses. A large amount of information was collected comparing reactions in children who had received vaccines with those who had not. However, the vaccine types could not be compared because of the different ways the data were collected and presented in the studies. It was not possible to analyse the safety of vaccines from the studies due to the lack of standardisation in the information given. Very little information was found on the safety on inactivated vaccines, the most commonly used, in young children. Copyright \u00a9 2006 The Cochrane Collaboration.

The oral polio vaccine (OPV) contains live attenuated virus, which can, in rare cases, cause a paralysis known as vaccineassociated paralytic polio (VAPP), and also vaccinederived polioviruses (VDPVs) due to acquired neurovirulence after prolonged duration of replication. The incidence of poliomyelitis caused by wild polio virus (WPV) has declined dramatically since the introduction of OPV and later the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), however, the cases of paralysis linked to the OPV are currently more frequent than those related to the WPV. Therefore, in 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended at least one IPV dose preceding routine immunisation with OPV to reduce VAPPs and VDPVs until polio could be eradicated. Objectives To assess the effectiveness, safety, and immunogenicity of sequential IPVOPV immunisation schemes compared to either OPV or IPV alone. Search methods In May 2019 we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, 14 other databases, three trials registers and reports of adverse effects on four web sites. We also searched the references of identified studies, relevant reviews and contacted authors to identify additional references. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasiRCTs, controlled beforeafter studies, nationwide uncontrolled beforeafter studies (UBAs), interrupted time series (ITS) and controlled ITS comparing sequential IPVOPV schedules (one or more IPV doses followed by one or more OPV doses) with IPV alone, OPV alone or nonsequential IPVOPV combinations. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Main results We included 21 studies: 16 RCTs involving 6407 healthy infants (age range 96 to 975 days, mean 382 days), one ITS with 28,330 infants and four nationwide studies (two ITS, two UBA). Ten RCTs were conducted in highincome countries; five in the USA, two in the UK, and one each in Chile, Israel, and Oman. The remaining six RCTs were conducted in middleincome countries; China, Bangladesh, Guatemala, India, and Thailand. We rated all included RCTs at low or unclear risk of bias for randomisation domains, most at high or unclear risk of attrition bias, and half at high or unclear risk for conflict of interests. Almost all RCTs were at low risk for the remaining domains. ITSs and UBAs were mainly considered at low risk of bias for most domains. IPVOPV versus OPV It is uncertain if an IPV followed by OPV schedule is better than OPV alone at reducing the number of WPV cases (very lowcertainty evidence); however, it may reduce VAPP cases by 54% to 100% (three nationwide studies; lowcertainty evidence). There is little or no difference in vaccination coverage between IPVOPV and OPVonly schedules (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 1.06; 1 ITS study; lowcertainty evidence). Similarly, there is little or no difference between the two schedule types for the number of serious adverse events (SAEs) (RR 0.88, 95% to participants; evidence); or the number of people with protective humoral response P1 (moderatecertainty evidence), P2 (for the most studied schedule; two IPV doses followed by OPV; lowcertainty evidence), and Two bivalent antibodies compared to trivalent OPV (moderatecertainty evidence), but may make little or no difference to P1 or P2 neutralising antibodies following an IIO schedule or OPV alone (lowcertainty evidence). Both IIO and IIbO schedules may increase P3 neutralising antibodies compared to OPV (moderatecertainty evidence). It may also lead to lower mucosal immunity given increased faecal excretion of P1 (lowcertainty after OPV challenge.
