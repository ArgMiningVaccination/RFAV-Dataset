It looks like you go to a store and find a pair of glasses and wear it without knowing your prescription and expect you can see perfectly. The chance is little. If it causes you back pain, please don't wear it anymore.

In my opinion, needle is the real acupuncture. Other than that, I don't think it will have the same result as acupuncture.

Please consult your local acupuncturist for accurate assessment.

Assuming the images I found are similar to what you have, it appears that these are designed mostly to stimulate the soles of the feet. That gives us two possibilities for what might have happened - one is a more physiologic explanation and the other is a more Chinese approach. 1. Unlike the presentation in most anatomy and physiology texts, the musculoskeletal system is highly integrated and overlapping. These overlaps are sometimes referred to as myofascial chains or myofascial slings. There is a chain of overlapping muscle and connective tissue that starts on the sole of the foot, extends via the achilles up the calf, transitions into the hamstrings on the posterior thigh, crosses the buttock on the glutes, extends up the back via the spinal erectors and quadratus lumborum, ending at the posterior shoulder in the upper latissimus dorsi. Excess tension anywhere along this chain can cause pain or radiating pain at any other point along the chain. If the slippers caused the plantar fascia of the foot to tighten or changed the way you stand/walk such that there was uneven compensation on one side of the body, then back pain (or pain at any point along that posterior chain) could have developed as a result. 2. In Chinese medical theory, the kidney, due largely to its position in the body, is thought to control the lower back. Low back pain with certain presentation is thus often treated via acupuncture points located on the kidney channel. The first point on the kidney channel is located on the sole, just behind the ball of the foot. Excess stimulation of this point could lead to a kidney deficiency situation resulting in low back pain. Acupuncture and Chinese medicine are much more complicated than most people want to believe. Sometimes products like this are fine for consumer use and sometimes, depending on the person, they may be exactly the wrong thing. The quickest way to resolve your problem is either to see a good massage therapist and have them work the entire posterior chain from the sole of the foot to the back of the shoulder or find a licensed acupuncturist in your area, explain to them what happened, and let them put your system back in to proper balance.

[Andrea Cillo](/Expert/81226399-Andrea-Cillo)Acupuncturist Bay Shore, New York To speak on the shoes specifically, they can be overstimulating your Kidney's which can cause back pain, but they may also be changing your posture, weight distribution, and how you walk which can also cause back pain.
