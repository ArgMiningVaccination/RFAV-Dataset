Oseltamivir (Tamifluw) has been shown to be effective in the treatment and prevention of epidemic influenza infection in adults, adolescents and children ( > _1 year). Although oseltamivir has not been approved for prophylactic use in children, it has been shown to be effective. Oseltamivir is also activeagainst avian influenza virus strains. Evidence suggests that lower doses or shorter durations of treat-ment/chemoprophylaxis other than those approved may not be effective and may contribute to emer- gence of viral resistance. Safety data from dose ranging studies show that 5 day courses of 150 mg twice daily for treatment and 6 week courses of 75 mg twice daily for prophylaxis were as well toleratedas the approved dose regimens. The use of oseltamivir in a pandemic is influenced by the goals of the pandemic plan developed by the responsible Government and Health Authority. To optimize use of antiviral medications, processes will be needed to collect, collate and report outcome data from treatedpatients and/or from use for chemoprophylaxis of pandemic influenza during the rst-wave outbreaks.If oseltamivir is included in a national or regional pandemic plan, stockpiling of the material, either in the form of capsules or the bulk active pharmaceutical ingredient will be necessary. In the absence of a stockpile, there is no guarantee that an adequate supply of oseltamivir will be available.

The biology of influenza A virus Influenza virus is an enveloped RNA virus of the orthomyxo- virus family with a genome that is composed of eight (influenza A and B) or seven (influenza C) segments. Influenza A and B are responsible for the annual outbreaks of epidemic influenza inhumans. The virus capsid contains two major antigenic proteins, haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). There are 16 different HA subtypes (H1-H16) and nine different NA sub-types (N1-N9), all of which have been found among influenza A viruses. Wild birds are the primary natural reservoir for all subtypes of influenza A viruses and are thought to be the sourceof influenza A viruses in all other animals. Although most influ- enza viruses cause asymptomatic or mild Chemotherapy 2005; all rights reserved. at lake forest college on January 29, 2013 http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from infection with certain strains of H5 and H7 viruses can cause widespread disease and death among wild and domestic birdssuch as chickens and turkeys. Pigs are susceptible to avian, human and swine influenza viruses and thus have a potential to be infected with influenzaviruses from different species (e.g. ducks and humans) at the same time. In this circumstance, active replication of both virus subtypes within the same host may result in reassortment of thegenome RNA segments, creating a new virus containing a novelcombination of HA and/or NA capsid proteins, a process known as antigenic shift. Antigenic shift may result in the emergence of a new influenza A subtype which can cross the species barrierand infect humans, who may have little or no immunity to the new virus. If the virus can be transmitted easily from person to person, an influenza pandemic could occur. Influenza virus life cycle . The life cycle of influenza virus involves attachment to cell surface receptors, entry into the cell and uncoating of the viral RNA followed by replication of the viral genes inside the cell nucleus. After the synthesis of new copies of viral proteins and genes, these components assembleinto progeny virus particles, which then exit the cell by budding from the cell surface. 1The HA protein is responsible for virus binding to sialic acid containing receptors on host cells, mediating fusion between the viral envelope and the cellmembrane. 2The main role of NA, in contrast, is the release of newly manufactured virions from the cell. NA may have anadditional role in the pathogenesis of influenza; by removing thesialic acids present in mucin, NA activity may facilitate virus penetration into the respiratory tract and ease of access to the surface respiratory mucosa. In some viruses, NA has also beenshown to enhance virus pathogenicity and neurovirulence. 3The sialidase activity of NA also removes terminal sialic acidresidues from both the HA and NA proteins, as well as host cellsurface glycoproteins. Since the terminal sialic acid is critical for HA binding, the receptor-destroying activity of the NA counters the receptor-binding activity of the HA. In the absenceof functional sialidase, progeny virions aggregate on the cellsurface due to HA receptor-binding activity and fail to be released from the cell surface, limiting spread from cell to cell or, via infected respiratory secretions, from host to host. 4,5 Influenza A viruses also contain a third protein, the M2 protein, which is an ion channel, controlling the pH of the endosome and permitting release of the ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) into the cellcytoplasm. The activity of all of these enzymes is required for efcient influenza A virus replication in vivo . 1 Antiviral treatment of influenza The rst antiviral treatments for influenza were the adamantane derivatives, amantadine and rimantadine, which are inhibitors ofthe M2 ion channel protein contained within the influenza virus. Whereas both agents have been shown to be effective, they are active only against influenza A virus (influenza B does not pos-sess an M2 protein). Adamantane-resistant influenza A viruses emerge readily following use of both agents as the mutations required to produce resistance do not affect the ion channel func-tion of the protein. 6These mutations may occur naturally among some avian influenza strains.7These features contribute to the ease with which adamantane resistance develops in treated sub-jects. 8In contrast, the mutations required to give resistance tothe neuraminidase inhibitors are at the highly conserved activesite of the neuraminidase enzyme ( Figure 1). These mutations result in compromised neuraminidase activity and hence a lower potential for the emergence of resistance. The highly conserved nature of the active site of neuraminidase allows the neuramini-dase inhibitors to be active against all influenza A and B sub-types. Two neuraminidase inhibitors, oseltamivir and zanamivir, are available in the EU for the treatment of influenza. Oseltami- vir is orally active. 9,10Zanamivir however must be administered topically, by inhalation, or parenterally (iv), to be effective;11,12 only the inhaled product is commercially available. 20th Century influenza pandemics Three influenza pandemics occurred during the 20th century. The rst of these, from 1918 to 1920, was by far the most devas- tating with a death toll estimated to be between 20 and 50million people. The source of this outbreak has never been satis- factorily identied. Although some evidence points to it starting in the USA in March 1918, other data indicate the virus mayhave rst emerged in France as early as 1916. 13It is estimated that 50% of the global population became infected, of whomhalf suffered clinical illness, an attack rate of 25%. In someregions, e.g. Samoa and Alaska, the death rate was 25% of the population. 14Genetic characterization has shown the responsible virus to be of the A/H1N1 type.15 The clinical features of the infection were severe but mostly typical of influenza: rapid onset of fever, headache, myalgia,anorexia, nausea, vomiting and cough lasting 2-4 days. Epistaxis was a frequent but unusual symptom. Unusually,a proportion of patients died very quickly, having been rapidly overcome by a tracheobronchitis associated with dyspnoea and the appearance of mahogany spots around the mouth which coa-lesced into a heliotrope cyanosis. Post-mortem data from such patients indicated haemorrhagic lungs with an absence of pus. Of those patients who recovered, up to 18% subsequently devel-oped pneumonia. The increase in mortality associated with this Figure 1. Diagram depicting the structure of neuraminidase (N1 and N2) in relation to bound oseltamivir. Arrows depict sites of known mutations in resistant subtypes of influenza virus.P. Ward et al. i6 at lake forest college on January 29, 2013 http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from pandemic was notably greater in young adults than in other age groups, and in the elderly, mortality was actually decreased com-pared with normal influenza epidemics. Females < 35 years accounted for 70% of all female influenza deaths. 16 The pandemic of 1957-1958 originated in China and was transmitted mainly along sea lanes, spanning the globe within6-7 months. Infection rates were similar to the 1918 pandemic, with 40-50% of people becoming infected, and 25% developingillness. The course of this infection was clinically typical ofinfluenza, and most deaths arose due to pneumonia, although a higher than normal incidence of primary viral pneumonia was recorded. Mortality was conned mainly to the very young andthe elderly. Nevertheless, the total death toll was estimated to be 1 million. 14Genetic analysis indicates that this pandemic was caused by an A/H2N2-type virus. The 1968 influenza pandemic originated in Hong Kong, was the mildest of the 20th century pandemics, and was caused by an A/H3N2-type virus. In many regions, the virus seeded itselffor up to 12 months before causing more serious disease in thesecond wave in 1969. 13 Although excess mortality was mainly observed in the elderly, and attributable to secondary infections, in both the1968 and 1957 pandemics, the relative increase in excess death- swas greater among young adults, as noted earlier for the 1918 pandemic. The partial protection of older persons is thought tobe due to retained heterosubtypic immunity following prior exposure to similar antigens as children or young adults. 16 Lessons learned from previous pandemic experience Our knowledge of the clinical epidemiology of pandemic influ- enza is derived from information generated during the three influenza pandemics which occurred in the 20th century. Four elements of this experience are pertinent to the matters discussedin this report: (i) The clinical features of pandemic influenza differ from those of epidemic influenza in that clinical progression within anindividual may be signicantly faster and associated with a sig- nicantly increased risk of fatal primary viral pneumonia. The relative increase in excess deaths is likely to be amongst youngadults. (ii) Antigenic cross-reactivity provides some protection against infection and ameliorates the pattern of illness within anindividual as well as limiting spread within the community. (iii) Among the population segment previously exposed to a strain sharing some cross antigenicity, mortality remains highestin those with a degree of existing co-morbidity (pre-existing car-diac disease, respiratory disease, renal disease, diabetes, imm- unosuppression or pregnancy). (iv) Several waves of illness may occur during which the properties of the virus and the clinical pattern of illness withinindividuals and communities may alter. During a pandemic, the number of people infected and the resul- tant mortality will be much higher than in a seasonal epidemic. Thus the ability of a government to deal with the chaos of a pan-demic will be dependent upon their level of pandemic prepared- ness. It is for this reason that the WHO has provided broad guidance on key elements of a pandemic plan and has stronglyurged all countries to develop their own detailed pandemic plans. 17Current events, particularly with avian influenza (see the fol- lowing section) have brought into focus the potential for anotherinfluenza pandemic, with perhaps the most likely candidate strain being a modied avian H5N1 strain. Although rst ident- ied in 1997, there is, as yet, no candidate vaccine for this virusin production. It is also possible, of course, that a pandemic may arise from another source, precluding the possibility of advance vaccine preparation. Thus, pandemic planning for the control ofinfluenza within communities, which is the responsibility of gov-ernments and responsible health authorities, needs to include options for control of influenza that involve the use of antiviral medications. In particular, the need for advance stockpiling ofsuch agents, in order that sufcient quantities may be available at the time of a pandemic, should be addressed. Avian influenza Several instances of human infections and outbreaks following interspecies transmission of avian influenza have been reported since 1997.18Most cases have resulted from contact with infected animals or contaminated surfaces. In 1997, the infection of 18 individuals with an unchanged avian influenza A virus (H5N1), six of whom died, was another sign that the threat of an influenza pandemic still exists, although serological investi-gations showed that human-to-human transmission was veryrare. 19In 2003, H5N1 and H9N2 infections were conrmed in Hong Kong with several reported cases of mortality. Since Janu-ary 2004, outbreaks of avian H5N1 influenza have been reportedin several countries in Asia. These outbreaks were believed to have been contained earlier in the year, but beginning in June 2004, new deaths were reported in Vietnam caused by a highlypathogenic H5N1 avian influenza. This second H5 strain has some immunological differences to the 1997 strain suggesting that vaccines derived from the 1997 seed strains may be ineffec-tive against it. 20 In 1999, H9N2 avian influenza was conrmed in two children in Hong Kong and several additional cases from mainlandChina. In 2003, another outbreak of H9N2 infection was con-rmed in Hong Kong. The largest avian influenza outbreak occurred in the Netherlands in 2003 and involved an H7N7 virus. Recent evidence has emerged suggesting that approxi-mately 1000 people, mainly farmers and poultry workers, were infected by the virus as a result of handling poultry. 21Of these, approximately 500 complained of symptoms consisting mainly of conjunctivitis and influenza-like illness.22In another unex- pected nding, those who developed symptoms after beinginfected passed the virus on to approximately 59% of theirhousehold contacts. 21 The biological properties of these potential pandemic influ- enza strains have been explored in a series of animal modelsincluding the BALB/c mouse, 23the cynomolgus monkey,24and the ferret.25Ferrets are naturally susceptible to infection with human influenza A and B viruses and their disease resemblesthat of human influenza. For these reasons, the ferret model sys-tem is widely used as a model for influenza virus pathogenesis and immunity studies. 25Active viral replication began promptly and peaked early in ferrets. Clinical symptoms were more severe than those observed following infection of control groups with an epidemic H3N2 strain, although the H5N1 virus titres were 1000-fold lower than those of H3N2. Viral shedding from therespiratory tract continued for > 7 days with peak virus titresOseltamivir (Tamifluw) and its potential for use in an influenza pandemic i7 at lake forest college on January 29, 2013 http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from being reached on day 1 post-infection.25Among animals infected with H5N1 avian influenza, but not among those infected with epidemic H3N2 influenza, virus was also isolated from multiple systemic organs, although at substantially lower titres than from respiratory tract samples.25Histopathological features were consistent with broncho- and interstitial pneumonia with no evidence of secondary bacterial superinfection. The data from the BALB/c mouse are similar with all infected mice pro-ducing prompt clinical evidence of illness with rapid progressionto a primary influenza virus pneumonia and death within 14 days. In mice, H5N1 infection failed to activate TGF- b production, which seemed to contribute to the virulence of the disease. 23 The primary lesion of experimental H5N1 virus infection in macaques was a severe necrotizing bronchointerstitial pneumo-nia similar in character and severity to that found in primary influenza virus pneumonia in humans. 24The viral aetiology of this lesion was conrmed by demonstration of virus in tissues by PCR and immunocytochemistry, while bacterial superinfection was ruled out by the absence of visible bacteria in Gram-stained sections of pulmonary tissue and the histological character of thepulmonary lesions. The authors commented that, had the maca-ques survived, the regenerative changes in their lungs observed on day 7 post-infection would probably have developed into the organizing diffuse alveolar damage with interstitial brosis seenin two humans who died 1 month after H5N1 virus infection and contributed to the respiratory distress syndrome both developed, and from which they died. 24 Rationale supporting inhibition of neuraminidase as an option for control of pandemic influenza As noted in the subsection 'Influenza virus life cycle' above, the influenza virus life cycle is dependent on the activity of the twocapsid surface proteins, HA and NA. The viral HA is a fusion protein which binds to sialic (neuraminic) acid based cellular receptors on the epithelial cell membranes of the host species.Once bound to the cell membrane, viral nucleoproteins and viralRNA are incorporated into the epithelial cell nucleus where virus replication occurs. Newly formed virions emerge from the infected cell but remain bound to the sialic acid of receptors onthe cell membrane unless cleaved from the cell surface by the viral NA. Recently, viral NA has also been shown to be involved in the initiation of influenza virus infection. 26Thus NA activity is a key component of the virus life cycle. Although nine different types of NA (N1-N9) have been recorded in the influenza viruses infecting different animalspecies, the active site of each of these subtypes shares a high degree of sequence identity. This makes it an attractive target for antiviral intervention as an effective inhibitor of one NAtype is likely to have activity against the other subtypes. As the viral NA is an antigen, NA-specic antibody can be generated. The effect of NA-specic antibody has beenexplored in animal species and been shown to protect againstinfection following exposure, and to ameliorate the illness associated with influenza virus infection in sero-susceptible animals; NA-specic vaccination has been shown to be protec-tive in humans. 27 - 32 The protective effect of NA antibody in humans is thought to underlie the lower impact of the 1968 pandemic as thepandemic strain shared an NA (N2) which had been a featureof the influenza viruses (H2N2 strains) circulating beforethe emergence of the pandemic strain, which possessed a novelHA Oseltamivir Oseltamivir is the a specic inhibitor of influenza virus NA. Oselta- mivir has been shown to be clinically active for the treatmentand chemoprophylaxis of influenza in adults and in children andis currently approved for use in 80 countries worldwide. Activity of oseltamivir carboxylate in vitro Oseltamivir carboxylate (OC), the active metabolite the parentprodrug oseltamivir, is a potent and selective inhibitor of all influenza A NA subtypes. 33,34The OC concentrations required to inhibit NA activity described herein were measured by a modi- cation of a method acid (MUNANA) as a substrate]. at IC 50s in the low nanomolar range.35The specicity of oseltamivir for influenza NA is high\u2014even at a concentration of 1 mM, OC had little or no inhibitory activity against NA from sources other than influenza viruses.34Although only influenza viruses containing the NA subtypes N1 or N2 have circulated widely in man in the past 100 years, and could be the source of a future pandemic,36,37it is also possible that a future pandemic may involve influenza A carrying one of the alternative NA subtypes, N3-N9.37,38Each of the NA subtypes may combine with any of the HA subtypes(H1-H16). The activities of OC against representative N3-N9NAs (IC 50range 0.3-1.5 nM)33,34are very similar to the geometric mean IC 50s using a similar assay (N1 = 1.54 nM, N2 = 0.43 nM) for approximately 900 clinical isolates collectedworldwide over the period 1996-1999. 39The IC 50of OC for A/Chicken/Pennsylvania/1370/83 (H5N2) NA was 1.3 nM.40 Antiviral tests in vitro against the recently circulating A/ Vietnam/1194/04 (H5N1) showed that this strain was sensitiveto OC, with an average 50% effective concentration for inhi- bition of plaque formation (EC 50) of < 10 nM.41 It is therefore likely that oseltamivir will be clinically effec- tive against influenza A viruses containing any form of NAenzyme. However, as in vitro assays, particularly antiviral assays in cell culture, 42are not a reliable method to predict dose requirements, dose-response relationships must be explored in animal models. Oral activity of oseltamivir in vivo in animals experimentally infected with human pandemic and avian influenza strains Oseltamivir is orally active in a variety of species. Interspecies differences in esterase activity require that different doses are administered to ensure that plasma concentrations of the carbox-ylate achieve levels associated with antiviral activity. To achieve the same area under the curve (AUC) as an oral dose of 75 mg twice daily in humans, mice require an oseltamivir dose of10 mg/kg, ferrets 5 mg/kg and chickens 120 mg/kg. Oseltamivir has been shown to be effective in vitro and in vivo in mice against a recombinant influenza A virus containing the H1 and N1 genes of the 1918 pandemic influenza virus. 43P. Ward et al. i8 at lake forest college on January 29, 2013 http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from Transmission of avian influenza viruses to humans has been conrmed on several occasions since 1997. The efcacy of osel- tamivir against these subtypes has been established in vitro and in various animal models. The efcacy of oseltamivir against H5N1 and H9N2 viruses was demonstrated both in vitro andin vivo in a mouse model of influenza infection.44,45When orally administered at doses of 1 and 10 mg/kg per day, oseltamivir prevented the It also reduced virus titres in the lungs and prevented the spread of virus to the brain of miceinfected with A/Hong Kong/156/97 (H5N1) and mouse-adapted A/Quail/Hong Kong/G1/97 (H9N2) viruses. When therapy was delayed until 36 h after exposure to the H5N1 virus, oseltamivirwas still effective and signicantly increased the number of survi- vors compared with control. Oral administration of oseltamivir (0.1 mg/kg per day) in combination with rimantadine (1 mg/kgper day) reduced the number of deaths of mice infected with 100median lethal dose (MLD 50) of H9N2 virus and prevented the deaths of mice infected with 5 MLD 50of virus. These ndings were conrmed in a second experiment, in which oseltamivircompared favourably with zanamivir and with an experimental product RJW-270201, which is no longer in development. 46 In a chicken model of systemic influenza virus infection using the highly pathogenic influenza virus A/Chick/Victoria/1/85(H7N7), oseltamivir treatment was associated with lower mor- tality than that of the control group. 34Also in the chicken model, oseltamivir reduced transmission, morbidity and mortality of an H5N2 strain and prevented viral shedding. There are, as yet, no data investigating the efcacy of oselta- mivir used for the treatment or prevention of more recent (2003) H5N1 strains in animal model systems. Human experience Oseltamivir was used to control the transmission of H7N7 avianinfluenza virus to humans in the Netherlands. 22Oseltamivir treat- ment at 75 mg twice daily was provided to all new clinical casesand a prophylactic regimen (75 mg daily) was used to protectpoultry workers and their families, which was to be continued until 2 days after their last exposure. In this context, permission was granted by the Dutch Health Authorities to use oseltamivirprophylactically for longer than the approved 6 week period (unofcially reported to have been up to 12 weeks of prophylac- tic use). However, oseltamivir prophylaxis was started late in theoutbreak due to hesitancy about its optimal use and acceptanceby the population. Nevertheless, towards the end of the outbreak, more patients took their antiviral medication. Protection against virus transmission was observed with avian influenza virus infec-tion being detected in 5/52 (9.6%) untreated subjects compared with 1/38 (2.4%) of those who took oseltamivir (protective ef- cacy of 75%). As the numbers were small however, the differ-ence was not statistically signicant. The WHO recommended oseltamivir for treatment of clini- cases and prophylaxis tocontrol recent H5N1 avian influenza outbreaks. Hien et al. 46 reported the clinical and epidemiological ndings of 10 con-rmed human cases of avian influenza (H5N1) who presented tohospitals in Vietnam between December 2003 and January 2004.Oseltamivir treatment began well after symptoms were estab-lished (> day 10) in only ve of the cases, four of whom died. Experience from studies conducted in epidemic seasons pertinent to use in a pandemic Treatment of influenza . Oseltamivir is currently indicated for the treatment of influenza in patients aged > _1 year. The adult dosage is 75 mg twice daily, with weight-based unit dosing using the suspension for children ( Table 1). Dose adjustment is only necessary in patients with severe renal impairment, as evi- denced by a creatinine clearance (CL CR) < 30 mL/min. The effectiveness of oseltamivir in the treatment of influenza infection has been demonstrated in a range of clinical studies.The clinical benet of oseltamivir treatment of influenza infec- tion in adults, using a pooled dataset from these 10 studies, hasbeen summarized. 47The key benets of oseltamivir treatment were earlier resolution of illness combined with earlier return to normal health and ability to carry out normal activities. In patients with co-morbid conditions, mainly cardiac and chronicrespiratory diseases, overlap of symptoms between influenza and the underlying conditions precluded demonstration of earlier resolution of allsymptoms (the primary end point). However, the duration of febrile illness (fever, myalgia and chills/sweats) was signicantly reduced. The benets of oseltamivir treatment are not restricted to the resolution of influenza symptoms. There is clear evidence that oseltamivir treatment leads to a reduction in secondary lower respiratory tract complications [infections (LRTI), bronchitis, pneumonia] and hospitalizations. 48Relative to placebo-treated patients, overall, those receiving oseltamivir were 55% less likely to develop an influenza-related LRTI requiring antibiotic treatment. In patients considered at increased risk of such com-plications, there was a 34% decrease in LRTIs requiring anti- biotics and a 59% reduction in hospitalizations. The benets of oseltamivir treatment have also been demon- strated in children aged > _1 year. 49Oseltamivir treatment resolved illness 36 h earlier than in the placebo arm. In young children, the main secondary complication arising from influenzainfection is otitis media. This study demonstrated the ability ofoseltamivir treatment to reduce the incidence of new diagnoses of otitis by 44%, a clear demonstration of the benets of a Table 1.

In children with mild to moderate asthma, there was a small but signicant improvement in the forcedexpiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1). Data have recently also been published detailing the use of oseltamivir in preventing complications arising from influenza inimmunocompromised patients following bone marrow transplan- tation. 50Although not a controlled study, by comparison with data from the same centre in previous seasons, the authors con- cluded that oseltamivir use was well tolerated and that it hadplayed an important role in preventing influenza complications in this population. An obvious concern in the pandemic context is the require- ment that treatment begins within 48 h of the onset of symptoms.The practical implications of this are signicant even in a nor- mal influenza epidemic, but are substantially greater in a pan-demic situation. It is well recognized that by the time symptoms become apparent, viral replication and transmission may have already been ongoing for perhaps 24 h. Not surprisingly there-fore, it has been demonstrated that increased benet can be obtained by providing oseltamivir as soon as possible after the onset of symptoms. 51 While authorities are concerned to understand whether treat- ment may be effective if started later, data from the animal models of avian influenza (see the section 'Lessons learned from previous pandemic experience' above) conrm that viral replica-tion peaks early and late intervention may not be successful. 44 Intervention should not be postponed beyond the 48 h approvedfor epidemic influenza and given the rapidity of clinical deterio-ration noted in infected cases, treatment plans should emphasize treatment intervention at the earliest possible time in suspected cases. Prophylaxis. Oseltamivir is currently indicated for the prophy- laxis of influenza in adults aged > _13 years ( Table 1). Data from a recent study demonstrate preventive efcacy in children aged > _1 year. 52Registration studies examined 'post-exposure' prophy- laxis (PEP) in a family setting.55The outcomes of these studies are summarized in Table 2.The overall conclusions from these studies were that oselta- mivir, administered at a dose of 75 mg once daily for a period of 7-42 days: (i) Reduced the incidence of laboratory-conrmed clinical influenza by up to 92% ( P< _0.001). (ii) Reduced the incidence of influenza A and B virus infection. (iii) Reduced the proportion of subjects shedding influenza virus. (iv) Reduced the incidence of clinically diagnosed compli- cations of influenza (e.g. bronchitis, sinusitis and pneumonia). (v) Did not prevent the formation of a specic antibody response to influenza infection. (vi) Did not result in the development of resistance. Protective efcacy was maintained whether subjects were at risk of influenza only from an encounter with an individual in the community or were in close and prolonged contact withan infected individual. Efcacy was demonstrated regardless of pre-existing immune status. There was no evidence that the protective efcacy of oseltamivir in adults and children > _13 years was altered by age, gender, geographic region, or the pre- sence of pre-existing co-morbidity [particularly chronic obstruc- tive pulmonary disease (COPD)]. Data from a further PEP study 53have shown that treat- ment of influenza is not an effective stratagem for prevent-ing transmission of influenza in close contact scenarios. Thisstudy provides clear evidence that control of an influenzaoutbreak (epidemic or pandemic) is not possible solely by treating ill cases as they develop. Rather, a strategy invol- ving prophylaxis is essential if virus transmission betweenindividuals is to be interrupted and the outbreak curtailed and controlled. In 2004, Hayden et al. reported the outcomes of a study 52 which compared the effectiveness of expectant treatment withthat of treatment plus PEP in preventing secondary spread of influenza within households. All index cases were treated withoseltamivir and contacts were randomized by household to Table 2.

PEP provided an additional protective ef- cacy against proven influenza of 58.5% for households and 68% for individual contacts compared with treatment alone. Exclud-ing contacts who were already virus infected at baseline, the pro- tective efcacy of treatment plus PEP over symptomatic treatment alone increased to 78.8% and 84.5% for householdsand contacts, respectively. In contrast to the earlier PEP studyreported by Welliver et al., 55the trial included children aged > _1 year as both index cases and contacts. The fact that children area signicant vector in influenza virus transmission is well recog-nized and, in fact, more than 50% of reported secondary influ- enza cases in this study were children aged 1-12 years. Amongst paediatric contacts managed expectantly, the incidenceof influenza illness was almost three-fold higher in the 1-12 year age group than among contacts aged > _13 years (24% ver- sus 8%). PEP reduced the incidence of febrile influenza illness by 55% among paediatric contacts and by 80% among thosewho were not already infected with influenza at study start. Another important point to emerge from this study was the fact that, despite simultaneous treatment and prophylaxis within thesame household, no virus resistant to oseltamivir was detected in any participant in the study. Outbreak control in institutionalized populations presents unique challenges, particularly if the populations are frail fromdisease or age. Oseltamivir has been used successfully to control several outbreaks in nursing home populations. Simultaneoustreatment and prophylaxis with oseltamivir have also been used successfully to control influenza A outbreaks in Canadian nur- sing homes, in some cases after amantadine failure. 56Similar results have been reported where oseltamivir use controlled aninfluenza B outbreak in an elderly nursing home population. 57 Outbreak control was achieved following an average of 15 daysof prophylaxis, although the period ranged from 9 to 23 days inthe individual institutions. The maximum duration of influenza prophylaxis with oseltami- vir employed during the registration studies was 6 weeks, a periodwhich was chosen to reflect the normal maximum duration over which influenza may persist in a particular local area. The maxi- mum dose studied was 75 mg twice daily. As circumstances maydiffer somewhat in a pandemic situation, any data indicating thesafety of higher doses or more prolonged exposure are pertinent. A recent publication 57describes the use of oseltamivir for prolonged (8 weeks) prophylaxis in a paediatric cancer centre. The popu- lation ( n= 32) were immunocompromised by chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation and were aged 6-23 years. No influ-enza infection was noted during the study period and the sideeffects of oseltamivir were few and acceptable (gastrointestinal upset in ve of the subjects). Similarly, the registration studies showed that the safety prole of twice- versus once-daily oseltami-vir given over 6 weeks for seasonal prophylaxis was identical. Data produced since registration of oseltamivir for prophylaxis against influenza have led to the extension of theage range to include children aged > _1 year, and raised the duration of exposure for which safety data are available from 6 to 8 weeks. Of crucial importance is an awareness of the mechanisms by which oseltamivir is effective in prophylaxis. Datareported by Hayden et al. (1999) 53and Peters et al. (2001)54 clearly demonstrate that oseltamivir does notprevent the indi-vidual from being infected by the virus, and hence raising an immune response to it. Rather, the drug works by preventingproductive viral replication and release of virus from infected cells, such that the infection remains, in almost all cases, sub-clinical or associated with only minor symptoms. Haydenet al. (1999) 53reported that 55/519 (10.6%) placebo recipients became infected with influenza, of whom 19 (36%) developeda febrile illness compared with 55/1043 of whom 7/55 (13%) developeda febrile illness. In an elderly population, 54not only did a greater number of subjects with evidence of infection (a four-fold or higher rise in type-specic HAI antibody) developinfluenza illness\u201412/19 (63%) on placebo compared with 1/13 ( /C248%) of oseltamivir recipients, but also the group geo- metric mean increase in antibody titre was greater among oseltamivir recipients than among placebo recipients. The ability of the individual to be protected from the consequences of influenza infection, while still mounting animmune response sufcient to protect them against subsequentexposure, will be even more crucial in a pandemic situation than in the normal epidemic situation. We would contend, therefore, that two key messages derive from the oseltamivir dataset and should be included in any pan-demic guidance: (i) Control of the spread of influenza infection is not possible solely by the treatment of symptomatic cases as they emerge. (ii) Prophylaxis with oseltamivir in the immunocompetent individual will not prevent the development of an antibodyresponse, which may in turn offer a measure of protectionagainst antigenically cross reacting viruses of the same strain. 'At-risk' populations With normal epidemic influenza infections, 'at-risk' populationsare dened as those deemed most likely to suffer secondary con- sequences following viral infection, most usually pneumonia and bronchitis. Populations considered to be 'at risk' include theelderly, those with chronic respiratory or cardiac conditions, dia- betes, renal disease, pregnant women and children under 1 year of age. Efcacy has been demonstrated in the elderly and in patients with co-morbid daily cardiac and respiratory disease as detailedabove in the sections 'Treatment of influenza' and 'Prophylaxis'and in published references. 19,48Protective efcacy of 92% was demonstrated in an elderly population where 80% had beenvaccinated for the current influenza season. 54Clinical benet has also been reported when oseltamivir has been used for treatmentor prophylaxis in paediatric cancer patients, 58the elderly,59and bone marrow transplant recipients.50 Pregnant women Historical data from the influenza pandemics of 1918 and 1957 illustrate the potential risks of influenza in pregnant women and their fetuses. In the 1918-1919 pandemic, mor-tality associated with infection during pregnancy was reported to be over 50%, with higher rates of mortality reported in the later stages of pregnancy. 60During the 1957 pandemic, the obstetrical literature reported that 50% of the women of child-Oseltamivir (Tamifluw) and its potential for use in an influenza pandemic i11 at lake forest college on January 29, 2013 http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from bearing age who died of influenza were pregnant.61,62Further- more, 10% of all influenza deaths reported during the 1957 influenza season were in pregnant women, with the majority occurring during the latter half of pregnancy. Influenza in pregnant women during the pandemics of 1918 and 1957 wasassociated with pneumonia. In half the cases of influenza pneumonia in pregnant women, pregnancy was interrupted due to spontaneous abortion or delivery. Since that time, literaturereports have shown that epidemic influenza illness is commonin women in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy during the influenza season. Pregnant women may be at higher risk of developing serious complications of influenza infectionthan the normal healthy adult population. 63 - 68 There are no data from studies investigating oseltamivir treatment of pregnant women. Oseltamivir showed no evidenceof fetal toxicity or teratogenicity in animal testing (Roche: data on le). Data from pregnancies reported during clinical trials and in subsequent post-marketing experience reveal noevidence that receipt of oseltamivir results in a signicant risk of fetal abnormality (see 'Background' above). Nevertheless, in the absence of controlled data from pregnant women, osel-tamivir should be used in pregnant or lactating women only ifthe benet is considered to outweigh the potential risk to the unborn child. Children < 1 year of age The effect of influenza in the neonate or very young child is alsoassociated with substantial morbidity. In a prospective study of children infected with influenza before the age of 1 year, aboutone-third of the infections occurred in the rst 6 months of life. 69Excess rates of hospitalization due to acute respiratory dis- ease have been consistently reported in young children.70,71Rates of hospitalization during the influenza season are known to be highest in the very young as well as the very old.72In 2002, a toxicology study in juvenile rats was completed which demon-strated high mortality associated with CNS penetration andaccumulation of the prodrug and carboxylate at levels > 800- fold higher than the levels expected in children of /C241 year of age (Roche: data on le). Brain levels of oseltamivir in rats decreased with increasing age, reflecting the fact that the blood- brain barrier in the 7-day-old rat appears to be incompletely matured. There is general agreement that the human blood-brain barrier is fully developed by the age of 1 year. There areno data from clinical studies in children under 1 year of age and oseltamivir is not approved for use in this group. Oseltamivir should be used in children under 1 year of age only if the benetis considered to outweigh the potential risk. Virological considerations In a pandemic situation, direct antiviral activity against a novel strain would be helpful to reduce the overall period of risk of transmission to direct contacts. Indeed, during the rst wave of apandemic, before the availability of vaccines, appropriate anti- viral use will be the only option for control of the virus. Oseltamivir treatment of epidemic influenza was associated with reductions in the proportion of patients shedding virus,reduced titres of virus in respiratory secretions and a reduced overall viral load (AUC viral titres) in young otherwisehealthy adults, young,otherwise healthy, influenza-infected adults (who providednose and throat swabs for influenza virus culture at baselineand days 2, 4 and 6) the proportion of subjects still shedding virus on day 4 was lower on active treatment than on placebo (28% for the 75 mg and 23% for the 150 mg oseltamivir treat-ment groups, compared with 36% in the placebo group, P= 0.013). Mean and median virus titres were also /C241 log lower in the subjects treated with oseltamivir than in the pla- cebo group at each post-baseline assessment up to day 6(when virus shedding had ceased in most cases). Compared with the median value in the placebo group (128.3 log 10 TCID 50\u00b7h/mL), the AUC of virus 10TCID 50\u00b7h/mL ( P= 0.016) in the 75 mg twice daily dose group and by 22% to 90.2 log 10TCID 50\u00b7h/mL (P= 0.0002) in the 150 mg twice daily dose group, respect- ively. Similar results were obtained from studies in the elderlyand in children. The data indicate that subjects treated with oseltamivir stopped shedding virus earlier than did subjectsreceiving placebo. Virological resistance Virological resistance to NA inhibitors can be acquired byalteration of the drug target (NA) or via alterations in the afnity of HA for cell surface receptors. There is no evidence for the existence of naturally occurring oseltamivir-resistant variants. This is supported by the obser- vation that all pre-treatment samples from clinical studies revealed no instances of virus with reduced sensitivity to oselta- mivir. This was further supported by data from a separate studyof over 1000 clinical isolates taken from influenza surveillance before the launch of the NA inhibitors. 39 Mutations in neuraminidase .In vitro studies have shown that, as expected, given the high sequence conservation of NA enzymes, influenza virus with decreased sensitivity to OC owing to mutations in the viral NA can only be generated with difculty. Mutations observed are NA specic. Three mutations have beengenerated in vitro in influenza A N1 or A N2. Experiments have not been conducted with viruses carrying other NA subtypes.The in vitro data generated using N1 and N2 strains were gener- ally predictive of the mutations found following treatment ofinfected adults and children. Subsequent experiments (see the section 'Properties of resistant viruses' below) showed that the presence of these mutations reduced the biological tness ofaffected viruses. Thus the risk of transmission of oseltamivir- resistant virus in clinical practice is low. Mutations in haemagglutinin . After eight passages in the presence of oseltamivir, two mutations of viral HA have been observed with a minor decrease in susceptibility to oseltamivir (by 8.6- fold). However, owing to the slight decrease in sensitivity andother considerations, it seems unlikely that mutations in HA willbe of major signicance. 73Indeed, contrary to the observation that HA mutations generally precede NA mutations during in vitro resistance selection studies,74there is no evidence for the selec- tion of HA mutations in conjunction with NA mutations in influ- enza in the clinical setting.75 - 77 Resistance in clinical samples Influenza virus samples studied during clinical trials . The pri- mary assay to determine the emergence of resistance was aP. Ward et al. i12 at lake forest college on January 29, 2013 http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from change in NA phenotype between pre- and post-treatment samples, supported by extensive genotypic studies. Consistentwith in vitro data, resistance mutations arose at a low frequency during oseltamivir treatment. They were subtype specic,H274Y being identied in N1 NA and R292K in N2. There wasadditionally a very low frequency of E119V, found only in N2 NA. When detected, resistant viruses arose late in treatment, always on or after day 4, and were often present as a mixture ofboth wild-type virus and resistant virus, in which the wild-typedominated. The clinical course of patients carrying resistant epi- demic influenza is generally indistinguishable from those still carrying wild-type virus at the end of treatment. 77 Among the otherwise healthy adults enrolled in the dose ran- ging trials, three of the patients harbouring resistant virusreceived oseltamivir 75 mg twice daily and one patient received150 mg twice daily. As of July 2004, the incidence of oseltami- vir resistance seen in clinical trial samples was 0.33% (4/1228) in adults/adolescents (1-< _12 years) and 1.26% overall. Other reports of resistance to oseltamivir . A recent publication reported oseltamivir-resistant viruses in 9/50 treated with oseltamivir for influenza A (H3N2) infec-tion. 77The children were young (median age 3.7 years) with sev- eral < 1 year of age (contrary to the approved label). Consistent with our ndings, resistance was not selected until at least day 4 of treatment. The predominant mutation was R292K. Twoinstances of E119V were also found. One novel mutation, N294S, was identied. Again consistent with our ndings, there were no accompanying mutations in the viral HA. A Roche-sponsored clinical trial JV16284, was conducted in Japanese children in 2000/2001 (Roche: data on le). The predo-minant circulating virus was an N1 strain. Virus with resistantphenotype was found in 7/43 (16.3%) children\u2014all were due tothe H274Y mutation in influenza A (H1N1). In this study, as with the recently published data, 77children received a dose of 2 mg/kg body weight twice daily. Three 1-year-old children were among those found to harbour resistant virus in Study JV16284. Oseltamivir carboxylate is excreted via the kidney and renal excretion rates are inversely proportional to age in children < 12years of age. Outside of Japan, the approved dose of oseltamivir is a weight-based unit dosing regimen with administration using asyringe device. These dosing strategies act to increase plasma con- centrations of OC relative to the 2 mg/kg dose, particularly among pre-school age children, in whom there was some evidence ofunder-exposure relative to adults and children of school age. The apparently higher incidence of resistance seen in Study JV16284 78and Kiso et al.77may be a result of under-exposure to oseltamivir in young children. In Study JV16284, 30/70(42.9%) of the children were aged 1-3 years, and in Kiso et al. , 25 of the 33 (75%) children who had positive post- treatment viral samples were in this low age range. These children were likely to be encountering their primary infection with influenza, and under-exposure to an antiviral drug in this immunologically naive population would permit continuedviral replication and thereby increase the risk of the emer-gence of resistant virus. This hypothesis is supported by data from the study reported by Hayden et al. (2004). 52Children enrolled in this study received the weight-based unit doses approved outside of Japan.No resistance was identied in any of the 147 children treated,including the 26 children aged < _5 years (mean 3.76, median 4, range 1-5 years). If these interpretations are correct, the impli- cation is that the treatment of pandemic influenza in a totally naive population may require either higher exposures or longertreatment periods, or both, to reduce the potential for emergent resistant virus. Properties of resistant viruses . Viruses carrying each of the three most common NA resistance mutations to OC seen in the clinic (E119V and R292K in N2 and H274Y in N1) have been studied in more detail in animal models to furthercharacterize their transmissibility and virulence. Contrary to the statement of Kiso et al. , 77a study was carried out with low passage clinical isolates, none of which had any changes in the HA.79Each resistant isolate was compared with the cor- responding pre-treatment clinical isolate from the same patientto conrm this. 79 The overall tness (infectivity, replicative ability and patho- genicity) of the virus carrying the R292K mutation in the N2 NA gene was reduced in the ferret model of influenza infec- tion.79This conrmed previous studies in mice using in vitro selected mutant virus.74The R292K-carrying clinical isolate was not transmitted between ferrets under conditions where the cor-responding wild-type virus was transmitted to 100% of con-tacts. 80Similarly, evaluation of viruses carrying the H274Y mutation (N1) in the mouse and ferret models of infection alsorevealed that this mutant is less virulent/infective and is approxi-mately 100-fold less likely to be transmitted than the corre- sponding wild-type. 81,82 The situation concerning the E119V mutation (N2) is less clear. In mice, it was established that the infectivity of E119V virus was less than that of the wild-type. In a repeated ferret study (in the rst study, external factors complicated the interpretation of the data), the infectivity/replicative ability ofE119V was reduced by 100-fold compared with wild-type. How- ever, in a further study of transmission in the ferret, in which higher infectious titres were used, resistant virus was of similarinfectivity to wild-type and transmitted from infected animals to non-infected animals. 83 A mathematical model was developed to look specically at the dynamics of influenza transmission to predict the potential emergence and spread of drug-resistant virus.84The model demonstrates that the biological properties of the resistantviruses militate against the spread of virus, even when used in ahigh proportion of the population and for both treatment and prophylaxis. The new N294S mutant virus identied by Kiso et al. 77requires characterization, as will any future new mutations which may beidentied in N1 or N2 NA. Similarly, should a future pandemic involve a virus carrying one of the alternative NAs N3-N9,additional research would be needed to identify and characterize any further subtype-specic mutants emerging during treatment. In summary, the common phenotypic and genotypic changes observed in clinical influenza samples to date indicate that osel- tamivir-resistant influenza viruses arise infrequently and are, in the main, biologically impaired with regard to infectivity and potential for transmission. Continuing surveillance . The global Neuraminidase Inhibitor Susceptibility Network (NISN) was established in 1999 toaddress public health and regulatory concerns regarding theOseltamivir (Tamifluw) and its potential for use in an influenza pandemic i13 at lake forest college on January 29, 2013 http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from potential emergence of resistance, and consequences of drug resistance, following the introduction of the NA inhibitor classof drugs to the market. 42In a post-marketing period, 3/2691 (/C240.1%) clinical influenza samples showed resistance mutations.85The NISN continues to monitor for resistance to the NA inhibitors on a global level with particular emphasis on those regions with the highest clinical usage of NA inhibitors, currently Japan. Prompted by the report of resistance in Japanese children treated with oseltamivir,77the NISN has issued a statement85and emphasized that concerns about resistance to NA inhibitorsshould not dissuade countries from continuing to develop ade-quate drug stockpiles. A similar position was taken by Mos- cona 86while emphasizing the need to further study the properties and incidence of resistance to the NA inhibitors. The NISN con- tinues to monitor the situation in Japan and globally, and a study employing over 1000 recent clinical isolates is in progress, specically designed to seek evidence for generalized resistantvirus transmission in Japan. Safety considerations Assessment of data from the clinical trial programme, retrospec-tive studies from a US health insurance database and of post-marketing surveillance data provide a comprehensive review of the safety of oseltamivir in clinical use in subjectsolder than 1 year of age. 87,88No important safety concerns have evolved which might limit the suitability of oseltamivir for thetreatment and prevention of influenza in all approved patientpopulations. Experience from clinical trials Adult treatment studies. In a total of 2554 patients (includingpatients on placebo, 75 mg twice daily and 150 mg twice dailyoseltamivir) participating in the major studies in the treatmentof influenza, the most frequently reported adverse events were nausea and vomiting. 87These events were transient and gener- ally occurred with rst dosing. These events did not lead topatient discontinuation of study drug in the vast majority of instances. Some adverse events occurred more frequently in patients taking oseltamivir compared with those taking placebo. Theadverse events that occurred most frequently are shown inTable 3. This summary includes healthy young adults and at-risk patients (patients at higher risk of developing complicationsassociated with influenza, e.g. elderly patients and patients withchronic cardiac or respiratory disease). The incidence of the twomain drug-related events, nausea and vomiting, are slightly increased by doubling the dose to 150 mg twice daily but both doses appear to be well tolerated in this population. In general, the adverse event prole in the 'at-risk' patients in treatment studies was qualitatively similar to healthy youngadults. Paediatric treatment studies. A total of 1032 children aged 1-12 years (including 698 otherwise healthy children aged 1-12 and 334 asthmatic children aged 6-12) participated in studies of oseltamivir given for the treatment of influenza.A total of 515 children received treatment with oseltamivir suspension. The most frequently reported adverse event was vomiting. Other events reported more frequently by oseltamivir-treatedchildren included abdominal pain, epistaxis, ear disorder and conjunctivitis. These events generally occurred once, resolveddespite continued dosing and did not cause discontinuation of treatment in the vast majority of cases. Oseltamivir had no adverse effect on pulmonary function in children with asthma, where small improvements in peak flow and FEV 1were observed and asthma exacerbations were decreased in the active treatment group. Prophylaxis studies. A total of 3434 subjects (adolescents, healthy adults and elderly) participated in eld studies of chemo- prophylaxis of epidemic influenza; 1480 received the dose of 75 mg once daily for up to 6 weeks. Adverse events were quali-tatively very similar to those seen in the treatment studies,despite a longer duration of dosing. There were no clinically relevant differences in the safety prole of the 942 elderly Table 3.

Ward et al. i14 at lake forest college on January 29, 2013 http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from subjects, who received oseltamivir or placebo, compared with the younger population.87 Gastrointestinal problems were reported with similar overall frequency in subjects receiving oseltamivir once daily forpost-exposure prophylaxis and in those receiving twice dailytreatment of influenza-like illness in an influenza family transmission study. 52The incidence of vomiting was more fre- quent following twice daily administration for treatment than once daily administration for prophylaxis in both childrenand adults. Post-marketing experience Spontaneous reports . Oseltamivir was rst launched in 1999 and approximately 20 million patients have been exposed to the drug since the introduction into the market. Approximately 1 out of 10 000 patients was reported to have experienced > _1 adverse events. During the review period, about 4000 events were reported, of which 25% were considered serious. These con- cerned oseltamivir phosphate taken either as capsules or in theform of powder for suspension. More than 80% of all reports originate from Japan, where oseltamivir capsules were launched in February 2001 and the powder for suspension in April 2003.The adverse events reported may or may not be related to oselta-mivir therapy. The most frequently reported events were consistent with the events observed during clinical trials: nausea, vomiting,diarrhoea and dizziness. In addition, hypersensitivity reactions mainly allergic skin reactions such as rash, dermatitis, urti- caria, eczema, face oedema and erythema were reportedrarely. In very rare cases, more severe reactions such as Ste- vens-Johnson-Syndrome and erythema multiforme were reported. Very rare cases of hepatitis and elevated liverenzymes have been reported in patients with influenza-like illness receiving oseltamivir. Overdose . As yet, there is no experience with overdose, although the anticipated manifestations of acute overdose would be nausea, with or without accompanying emesis. Single doses of up to 1000 mg of oseltamivir have been well tolerated apart from nausea and/or vomiting. Pregnancy and lactation . At present, insufcient data are available in pregnant women taking the drug to enable an evalu-ation of the potential risk for oseltamivir to cause fetal malfor-mations or fetal toxicity. Oseltamivir should therefore be used during pregnancy only if the potential benet justies the poten- tial risk to the fetus. To date, there have been 61 reports of oseltamivir therapy during pregnancy. Among these, there were 10 reports of abor- tion (of which six were therapeutic terminations). Single cases of trisomy 21 and anencephaly have been reported; in bothcases, the causality was assessed as not related to treatment with oseltamivir. The majority of pregnancies reported resulted in the birth of a normal baby. In lactating rats, oseltamivir and the active metabolite are excreted in milk. It is not known whether oseltamivir and theactive metabolite are excreted in human milk, but extrapolationof the animal data provides estimates of 0.01 and 0.3 mg/day for the respective compounds. Oseltamivir should therefore be used only if the potential benet for the lactating mother justies thepotential risk for the nursing infant.Oseltamivir\u2014formulations and indications A key concern during any influenza pandemic will be ensuringan adequate supply of appropriate anti-influenza medications. It will take many months to prepare a vaccine against any new pandemic strain and antiviral drugs will be needed to help con-trol the outbreak before the generation of a vaccine. No manufacturer would be able to immediately produce enough drug to meet the potential demand during a pandemic, asthe demand is likely to be orders of magnitude higher than the demand during seasonal epidemics. The manufacturing process for oseltamivir is complex, and requires approximately 12months from raw materials to nished product. Oseltamivir can, however, be stockpiled in advance for later use during a pandemic. To this end, two options are offered forgovernments to consider when building a stockpile of oseltami-vir for pandemic use. These options are: (i) To stockpile the marketed formulations: (a) 75 mg cap- sules; (b) a powder for reconstitution as an oral suspension. (ii) To stockpile the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API; oseltamivir phosphate), as a powder for reconstitution as a sol-ution in a pandemic situation (see the section 'Magistral formu-lation' below). Marketed formulation The 75 mg capsules can be used for both treatment and prophy-laxis in adolescent and adult patients. The powder formula-tion is primarily intended to enable children to receive the drug, but may also be used by adults who are unable to swallow capsules. The powder for suspension and the 75 mgcapsules have been shown to be bioequivalent dosage forms.Both capsules and powder formulations can be stockpiled for use in a pandemic situation. Distribution and dispensing of the marketed form in a pandemic could be effected simplyand rapidly. Magistral formulation The API is a water-soluble dry powder, which is chemicallystable when stored in drums. When dissolved in water to a con-centration of 15 mg/mL, the solution is stable for 3 weeks at 258C or for 6 weeks at 5 8C. The powder is readily soluble in water (containing sodium benzoate as preservative) and provides a clear odourless solution. The API is exactly the same material which would normally be mixed with excipients and used to prepare the approvedcapsule and dry powder formulations. However, it avoids theadditional costs of product renement and packaging, thereby also providing the least expensive route for stockpiling. Oseltamivir dissolves readily following oral administration in capsule or suspension form and as such it is expected that thesystemic bioavailability of oseltamivir carboxylate following an API solution would be equivalent to the capsule and suspensionformulations. Oseltamivir has a bitter taste; however, taste con- siderations should pale into insignicance when patients are faced with treating a potentially fatal illness or to reducing thepotential for contracting an infectious disease with a high risk of mortality. Patients could also be informed that they may take the taste away afterwards, e.g. by having a strongly flavoured fruitdrink or chewing flavoured gum.Oseltamivir (Tamifluw) and its potential for use in an influenza pandemic i15 at lake forest college on January 29, 2013 http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from Considerations for dosing and duration of treatment/prophylaxis of pandemic influenza Viral replication and clinical pattern of illness Data from experimental infection in animal models suggest that viral replication of potential pandemic influenza strains followsa pattern similar to epidemic strains in the same species. In gen- eral, viral titres of avian strains are low, but reach a peak rapidly following initial infection. These data indicate that the currentlyrecommended time window between start of symptoms and start of treatment remains the maximum period over which clinical efcacy may be assumed. In contrast, the virulence (i.e. clinicaldisease) associated with pandemic or avian infection appears tobe signicantly worse. In some species, virus is detectable out- side of the respiratory tract. If this were to be the case in humans in the course of a pandemic, oseltamivir (which is distributedwithin total body water) would be preferable to inhaled topical influenza therapy (zanamivir). Animal model data show some evidence of protracted viral shedding. In these circumstances, a longer period of dosing maybe necessary to constrain rebound viral replication. Higher drug doses might be required to exert comparable antiviral effects andclinical benets in a pandemic compared with epidemic infec- tions. 89In the early phases of a pandemic, it therefore will be important to monitor the effectiveness of the currently approved dose and duration of treatment, and to take appropriate steps toincrease these, should control appear inadequate. One further consequence of insufcient dosing is the possible emergence of oseltamivir-resistant influenza strains. Recentlypublished data from Japan 77acknowledge the potential role of inadequate dosing and/or shortened treatment duration in theemergence of a higher level of resistant virus than previouslyseen. It is therefore imperative that currently approved dosing regimens are not decreased in an effort to make the drug supply 'go further'. Prophylaxis Prophylactic therapy with oseltamivir phosphate is consideredto provide protection from influenza while the agent is beingtaken. As detailed above in the section 'Prophylaxis', safety data have now been published to indicate the absence of sig- nicant adverse reactions for up to 8 weeks of once-daily dos-ing at 75 mg per day and there is anecdotal information regarding dosing for up to 12 weeks in the recent avian influ- enza outbreak in the Netherlands (see the section 'Humanexperience' above). In view of concerns about the potential duration of viral shedding by individuals infected with a pan- demic strain, the normal duration of post-exposure prophylaxisof 7-10 days should also be considered as the minimumperiod for which protection would be required in such circum- stances. For particularly high-risk individuals (any person who will be repeatedly exposed to infected patients), chemoprophy-laxis may be required for the entire duration of the outbreak within the community. These conclusions are supported by information from epi- demic modelling. Stilianakis et al. 90used data from an influenza A outbreak in a boarding school in 1978 to model the impact of several strategies on the development and transmission ofresistant virus in both an epidemic and pandemic situation.The model predicted that in a pandemic, chemoprophylaxis rep-resents the most benecial strategy followed by the combinationof treatment and prophylaxis. Chemoprophylaxis or a combi- nation of prophylaxis and treatment during a pandemic was shown in this circumstance to reduce symptomatic cases by41%. Drug resistance following use of an M2 inhibitor (all that was available at the time) with either strategy would be 13-22% of total symptomatic infections. A second model 84was developed to look specically at the dynamics of influenza transmission and treatment to predict the potential emergence of drug resistance over many years in a large population. The number of infections prevented per indi-vidual treated was used as the outcome measure. When treat- ment demand is low ( /C246%) symptomatic treatment outperforms prophylaxis. However, prophylaxis outperformed symptomatic treatment once demand exceeded 30%. The model also showed that at high levels of prophylaxis of 80%, such as might be envi- saged in a pandemic, influenza transmission could be dramati-cally lowered and the outbreak effectively controlled. A recent publication by Longini et al. 91adds weight to these ndings. The authors used stochastic epidemic simulations toinvestigate the effectiveness of targeted antiviral prophylaxis tocontain influenza. In this strategy, close contacts of suspected index influenza cases take antiviral agents prophylactically. The authors compared targeted antiviral prophylaxis with vaccinationstrategies and modelled an influenza pandemic similar to the influenza A virus (H2N2) that caused the pandemic of 1957- 1958. In the absence of intervention, the model predicted aninfluenza illness attack rate of 33% of the population [95% con- dence interval (CI): 30, 37] and an influenza death rate of 0.58 deaths/1000 persons (95% CI: 0.4, 0.8). With the use of targetedantiviral prophylaxis, if 80% of the exposed persons maintainedprophylaxis for up to 8 weeks, the epidemic would be contained, and the model predicted a reduction to an illness attack rate of 2% (95% Cl: 0.2, 16) and a death rate deaths/1000 per-sons (95% CI: 0.0003, 0.25). Van Genugten et al. 92assessed the potential impact of no intervention, influenza vaccination of either the total popu-lation or risk groups, pneumococcal vaccination or therapeutic use of NA inhibitors on hospitalization rates during a pan- demic outbreak. The therapeutic use of antiviral treatment wasestimated to reduce hospitalizations and deaths by 50%. How- ever, sensitivity analysis demonstrated that this prediction was sensitive to the assumptions made. Chemoprophylaxis wasnot assessed. The biological properties of the recent strains(see section 'Avian influenza' above) and the observed out- comes from post-exposure prophylaxis studies 52,55suggest that the base assumptions, and thus the resulting analysis, under- lying this model were incorrect. It is relevant here to note that epidemic modelling was used, taking epidemiology data directly from the eld, during the Sud-den Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak. It appeared that the modelling exercise was helpful in rening the manage- ment strategies in affected cities and in promoting the need for,and persuading the public to obey, the SARS containment pro-cesses dened from the pattern of transfection and spread. Outbreak control (treatment versus prophylaxis) One of the key priorities during an influenza pandemic is likely tobe to limit the extent of local outbreaks. Appropriate strategiesP. Ward et al. i16 at lake forest college on January 29, 2013 http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from therefore need to be clearly identied and communicated. The major problem with any outbreak is that infected individuals canbegin shedding virus, and hence infecting contacts, for 1-2 days before the onset of their acute symptoms, i.e. before they are aware that they are infected. There is likely to be debate as to therelative merits of treatment and prophylaxis under these circum- stances, particularly as limited drug availability may lead some to consider an approach involving treatment of infected cases only,rather than more widespread prophylaxis. As summarized above in the section 'Prophylaxis', the study reported by Hayden et al. 52on the management of influenza in households provides clear evidence that such an approach willbe suboptimal, and will lead to continued rounds of infection amongst contacts. Comparison of the outcomes of our two PEP studies (Welliver et al. 55and Hayden et al.52) suggests that there is no additional protective efcacy obtained by treatment of the index case combined with prophylaxis of the contacts over that provided by prophylaxis alone ( Table 4). Experience of the use of oseltamivir in the control of nursing home outbreaks of influenza has shown the effectiveness of a strategy of combined treatment and prophylaxis with oseltami- vir.56,57,93Indeed, in several of the affected institutions, oseltami- vir was used successfully after the failure of amantadine to control the outbreak. To date, in every outbreak where it has been used, oseltamivir has successfully brought it under control.Oseltamivir prophylaxis was well tolerated, and treatment of infection appeared to be associated with clinically important reductions in the rates of serious complications and antibioticuse. The majority of these data are derived from epidemic influ- enza in populations with some degree of immunity, either through vaccination or from prior influenza infection. It is notpossible to say for certain if these outcomes would apply duringpandemic exposure. However, as noted above, several groups have engaged in modelling and prediction exercises to assess scenarios that might best contain an outbreak and limit theimpact of important secondary outcomes, namely hospitaliz- ations and death and in general they reached similar conclusions. These data therefore suggest that, in a pandemic, a combined strategy of treatment and prevention is signicantly more likelyto result in effective outbreak control than is a strategy based solely on treatment of cases as they arise.Accuracy of clinical diagnosis Over recent years, the extent and accuracy of influenza surveillancehave increased dramatically. The European Influenza SurveillanceSystem (EISS) was launched in 1996, supported by the European Commission, and continues to grow. There are currently 22 sur- veillance networks within the EISS system, with a further sixafliated. Sentinel physicians take nose and throat swabs from sus-pected cases and forward these to reference laboratories for typing. The resultant information on the presence, proportion of cases and infecting strains is then made available. Full information is pro-vided on their website: http://www.eiss.org. 94 The limitation of the EISS system is the time taken for full laboratory characterization of the submitted swab samples andthe delay in reporting the results. Alternate, real-time, surveil- lance systems based on the use of near-patient diagnostic testing (NPT) or PCR are in use in several countries. The advantage ofthis approach is that up-to-date information on the presence and spread of influenza can be communicated on a much faster basis than the surveillance laboratory-based systems. The approach iscomplementary to conventional surveillance laboratory-basedsystems by providing physicians with good local and up-to-date information regarding the presence of conrmed influenza within their region. It is also a very valuable tool in those areas wherenational surveillance networks have not been established. Some NPT tests differentiate influenza A and B, but do not sub-type the strain\u2014that information still requires appropriate culturewithin the reference laboratories. Experience with an NPT sur- veillance system has recently been described. 95 Within a pandemic situation, the extent of influenza surveil- lance would be anticipated to increase dramatically, coordinated by WHO. Similarly, as the pandemic is recognized, the 'den- ing' clinical symptoms will be widely communicated, even among the public via public announcements in the electronicmedia or press articles. Further, concerns over inappropriate pre- scription of anti-influenza medication will be far outweighed by the desire to stem the spread of the outbreak. Given the rela-tively benign safety prole of oseltamivir (see above), and its acceptability for long-term prophylaxis, there should be few, if any, adverse consequences of oseltamivir being given inappro-priately to a person misdiagnosed with influenza. Overall conclusions and recommendations Oseltamivir has been shown to be efcacious and well tolerated in all populations studied and has been approved for use in most regions of the world. The data derived from published studies(see sections on 'Treatment of influenza' and 'Prophylaxis'above) were obtained during epidemic outbreaks of influenza. These were generally characterized as causing disease of mild to moderate intensity within populations with some immunity. Thesecondary complications resulting from these infections were, for the most part, mild and most often had the highest impact in the very young and the elderly. These data all indicate that75 mg twice daily for 5 days is the well tolerated and efcacious dose for treatment in adults and that 75 mg once daily provides a high level of protection against clinical influenza in children andadults, including the elderly. There are no clinical data available for the use of oseltamivir in a pandemic. Although preclinical data indicate that the 75 mgdose may provide adequate antiviral activity against a novelTable 4.

Data available to date indicate that, during normal seaso- nal (epidemic) influenza, the approved doses of oseltamivir fortreatment and prophylaxis are efcacious and well tolerated. In the absence of other information, the approved dose and duration of treatment/chemoprophylaxis represent the minimum requiredfor the management of pandemic influenza. Lower doses orshorter durations of treatment/chemoprophylaxis are not sup- ported by data and may contribute to the development of resist- ant virus. In these circumstances, it is reassuring that the safetydata from dose ranging studies show that 5 day courses of 150 mg twice daily for treatment, and 6 week courses of 75 mg twice daily for prophylaxis, were as well tolerated as theapproved dose regimens. The recommendations for use of oseltamivir in a pandemic are influenced by the goals of a particular government and theirstrategy for managing infection within their populations. If the goal is reduction in complications, hospitalizations and deaths and the consequent utilization of resources, then treatment seemsa viable option. If the goal is outbreak control to prevent furtherspread, then prophylaxis with or without treatment of the ill would be the option of choice. Scenario analysis or mathemat- ical modelling would be useful to determine which factorsmight influence the choice of options. The lag between the appearance of a pandemic strain and the availability of an appropriate vaccine should also be factored into the considera-tion of scenarios. Given these issues, a number of recommendations should be proposed to governments and health authorities struggling todevelop pandemic plans: (i) Dene objectives/goals in a pandemic. Dene what mix of treatment and prophylaxis will be required to meet these objectives.This will provide the foundation determining the magnitude of the stockpile required by an individual government. (ii) In the absence of other information, the approved dose and duration of treatment/chemoprophylaxis represent the mini-mum required for the management of pandemic influenza. Lower doses or shorter durations of treatment/chemoprophylaxisare not supported by data and may contribute to the development of resistant virus. (iii) In a pandemic, unlike an epidemic, most of the popu- lation will be immunologically naive and therefore doses of osel- tamivir higher than that approved may be needed to blunt virus spread. (iv) Longer periods of prophylaxis may also be required. (v) Governments need to establish a mechanism to monitor the effectiveness of oseltamivir or any other antiviral that they employ during the pandemic. Plans and processes should bemade in advance to collect, collate and report outcome data from patients using oseltamivir for the treatment and prophylaxis of pandemic influenza during the rst-wave outbreaks; the datashould be used to optimize the use of the product [as per rec-ommendations (iii) and (iv)]. (vi) Collection of nose and throat swabs and virological testing would be needed to provide information on the rateof emergence of resistant strains and the biological properties of these would need to be rapidly assessed in animal models.(vii) Mathematical modelling and scenario testing may help to determine the best strategy within a particular community. Fielddata would be essential to rene the model predictions and pro- vide information on optimized management strategies. (viii) The use of oseltamivir in the control of nursing home out- breaks of influenza has shown the effectiveness of the strategyof combined treatment and prophylaxis. Data from a household transmission study have shown that treating the ill family mem-ber alone does not stem the outbreak. (ix) If oseltamivir is included in a plan to handle a new pan- demic, stockpiling of the material, either in the form of capsulesor the bulk active material will be necessary because the surgecapacity will not be able to meet the demand once a pandemic is declared. In the absence of stockpiles, there is no guarantee that an adequate supply of oseltamivir will be available.
