Please refer to Appendix 12 for details. How Well We Are Doing - Behind the Numbers Dental caries is a complex and multifactorial chronic disease that is heavily influ enced by biomedical factors (diet, bacteria and host) and by social determinants of health. In Canada, 69% of children 6-11 years of age enrolled in publicly funded dental programs have dental disease and an estimated 2.26 milli on school-days are lost annually due to dental visit s or dental sick-days. Dental screening is a seco ndary prevention which aims at detecting disease as ear ly as possible to prevent, stop or slow the progression of dental disease to improve function and quality of life. With the exception of 2020, a significant number of school aged children are screened annually. Children and youth att ending primary or secondary school should be appropriat ely immunized against designated disease such as diphtheria, tetanus, measles, mumps, rubella, meningococcal disease, whooping cough and chickenpox. Vaccines build immunity, p rotect children and youth from getting the disease and prevent children and youth from spreading a vaccine preventable disease to others, particular some of our most vulnerable populations such as younger children and older adults. Assessing records ensures children and youth have the appropriate vaccinations. Vaccine preventable disease levels are at, or near, record lows in Toronto due to Toronto Public Health efforts to maintain high vaccine coverage. Service was suspended d ue to location closures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. toronto.ca/budget Budget Notes | Page 3 of 36 2021 Operating Budget & 2021 - 2030 Capital Plan Toronto Public Health How Well We Are Doing Service Service Measure 2018 Actual 2019 Actual 2020 Target 2020 Projection 2021 Target 2022 Target Status Outcome Measures Family Health Reproductive Health Screening - number of screens completed to identify individuals and families at risk for adverse birth outcomes in pregnancy 1,400 1,511 1,600 500 500 1,400 Infectious Diseases Prevention Immunization Record Assessment - percentage of immunization records for 7 and 17 year old children assessed * 100% 100% 100% 62% 100% 100% Infectious Diseases Prevention Toronto Urban Health Fund - number of community organizations funded to prevent transmission of HIV 49 40 40 47 48 48 * This Service Level Measure was affected by the closure of sch ools in mid-March 2020 as a result of public health measures en acted as part of the response to COVID-19. toronto.ca/budget Budget Notes | Page 4 of 36 2021 Operating Budget & 2021 - 2030 Capital Plan Toronto Public Health Service Service Measure 2018 Actual 2019 Actual 2020 Target 2020 Projection 2021 Target 2022 Target Status Service Level Measures Chronic Disease and Injury Prevention Percentage of municipally funded Student Nutrition programs receiving nutrition consultation and support in the school year * 59% 53% 55% N/A** 55% 55% Emergency Preparedness Maintain the availability of Toronto Public Health staff to respond to public health emergencies on a 24/7 basis Achieved Achieved Achieved Achieved Achieved Achieved Environmental Health Percentage of High Risk food premises in compliance with Food Premises Regulation 87% 90% 90% 90% 90% 90% * This Service Level Measure could not be reported as schools clo sed mid-March 2020 as a result o f public health measures enacted as part of the COVID-19 response. ** A modified version of this ser vice is being provided and a 2 021 Approved Target is not available at this time.
