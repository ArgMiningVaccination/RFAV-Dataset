Here you will learn the basics of chiropractic care and who can benefit from it, as well as some specific techniques offered by the professionals at Platt Chiropractic. What is Chiropractic Treatment? Chiropractic treatment focuses heavily on the central nervous system to heal areas in the body affected by the misalignment of the spine. Chiropractors are medical professionals that are trained to manipulate the spine through a method called [spinal subluxation](https://www.spine-health.com/treatment/chiropractic/subluxation-and-chiropractic). Spinal subluxation is done by manual pressure from the chiropractor onto the back, chest, or neck. It is used to adjust the spine in order to restore the proper function of the central nervous system, increase blood flow, and reduce inflammation in the body. The central nervous system runs through the spine and is responsible for sensations of hot, cold, and painful feelings. Whether a patient suffers from chronic pain, back pain, or frequent headaches, spinal subluxation is a wonderful way to help relieve this pain naturally, and within a few minutes. Who Can Benefit from Chiropractic Treatment? People of [all ages can benefit](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/guide/chiropractic-pain-relief) from chiropractic treatment, from infants and toddlers to expectant mothers and elderly patients.
