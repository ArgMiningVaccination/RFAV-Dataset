Crohn's disease is a chronic condition that causes inflammation in the digestive tract. The inflammation spreads deep down into the layers of your bowel tissue, mostly affecting the colon and the small intestine. Crohn's disease mostly affects people who fall in the age group of 19-40. Causes- Crohn's disease is believed to be caused by a combination of the following factors- - Immune system disorder- when your immune system mistakenly attacks the digestive tract cells while fighting an invading virus responsible for triggering Crohn's disease. - Genetics- those having a family/genetic history are often diagnosed with Crohn's disease. - Environmental factors- [smoking](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/smoking), poor [diet](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/healthy-diet), [stress](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/stress-disorder), certain medications and drugs (NSAIDs). This condition may be lifelong or can last for years. Symptoms to watch out for- Crohn's disease is usually detected by these symptoms- [Abdominal pain](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/abdominal-pain) [Weight loss](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/weight-loss) [Fatigue](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/fatigue) - Diarrhea - High, persistent [fever](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/fever) - Inflammation of eyes, skin and joints - Inflammation of bile ducts or liver - Reduced appetite - Delayed development and growth in children [Mouth sores](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/mouth-sores) - Blood in the stool This condition can sometimes lead to life-threatening complications, if not taken care of. Prevention- There is no cure for Crohn's disease. Certain medications, immunosuppressant, and steroids can only reduce the progression of the disorder. To prevent the disease, one should adopt the following preventive measures- - Change your diet- avoiding carbs, fiber-rich food, dairy etc. - Cope with stress level- exercise or practice [yoga](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/yoga)to reduce stress level as they trigger flare-ups [Quit smoking](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/quit-smoking)- smoking and alcohol consumption only increase the inflammation in your digestive tract. So make sure you quit smoking right away. Role of Homeopathy- In contrast to [allopathic treatment](https://www.lybrate.com/doctors-for-allopathic-treatment) including anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroids that induce several side effects, homeopathy precisely targets your immune system and restores its balance to normalcy. Homeopathic medicine for each patient depends on the individual's overall health. Your doctor will go through your medical history before treating each symptom with homeopathic medicines. Homeopathic treatment for Crohn's disease is extremely safe and beneficial with zero side effects since these are prepared from natural substances. Medicines extracted from aloe plants offer relief to patients with severe abdominal pain. Extracts from the [perennial](https://www.lybrate.com/lab-test/perennial-rye-grass/health-feed) plant Podophyllum is used to treat symptoms of diarrhea in patients suffering from Crohn's disease. Calcarea carbonica, produced from the middle layers of the shells, is prescribed to patients who have a history of [chronic fatigue](https://www.lybrate.com/treatment-for-chronic-fatigue) and poor diet. Homeopathy medicines are easy to take and can be availed over-the-counter. Reports have shown that homeopathy has a success rate of over 70% in treating symptoms of inflammatory bowel diseases including Crohn's disease. "}
