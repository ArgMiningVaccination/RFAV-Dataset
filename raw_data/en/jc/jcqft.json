In this collection of challenging lectures, Dr. Gl\u00f6ckler asks if a new science of healing can be developed today\u2014one that allows for realities of soul and spirit. With humanity standing at the threshold of a new spiritual consciousness, this question becomes increasingly relevant. Michaela Gl\u00f6ckler speaks on themes relating to the esoteric path of spiritual development and its therapeutic task for the individual and community. Giving an account of the evolution of the ancient mysteries in relation to medicine, she discusses the application of inner work in outer action, reflecting on modern social and ethical issues such as organ transplantation and the termination of pregnancy. Whereas the author is addressing primarily people involved in the healing professions, this book will be of interest to anyone interested in this new science of the spirit.
