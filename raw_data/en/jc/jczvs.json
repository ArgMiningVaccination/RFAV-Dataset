Post -acceptance 1. Scope and general policies of the Journal The Journal of Complementary and Integrative Medicine (JCIM) is a peer -reviewed journal which publishes research on evidence concerning the efficacy and safety of complementary and alternative medical (CAM) whole systems, practices, interventions and natural health products, including herbal medicines. JCIM is an online only journal , which is published quaterly. JCIM publishes only English -language articles in the following categories: Research Articles - Reports of original research. Reviews and Mini Reviews - Systematic, narrative, and focused reviews. Review articles are normally published by invitation, but suggestions to the Editors are welcome. Editorials Short Communications Short Communications on Medicinal Herbs and Complementary Therapies (see Appendix 2) Letters to the Editor and Replies Guidelines and Recommendations Congress Abstracts Submissions in the following fields are welcomed: Quality, efficacy, and safety of natural health products, dietary supplements, traditional medicines and their synthetic duplicates Efficacy and safety of complementary therapies Evidence -based medicine and practice, including evidence of traditional use Curriculum development, educational system and competency of complementary health programs Methodologies on research and evaluation of traditional medicines and herbal products Integrative medicine: basic and clinical research and practice Innovation in CAM Curriculum Educational Material Design Peer review JCIM is a single -blind journal. Manuscripts are reviewed anonymously by at least two independent reviewers selected by the Editors. Turnaround times JCIM aspires to notify authors about the review decision within 6-8 weeks from submission date. Revised manuscript s should be returned within 6 weeks. Accepted articles are published online within 4 weeks after acceptance. Rejection of manuscripts Manuscripts dealing with subjects that have been well studied in the literature, and that do not resolve questions raised by previous studies, or manuscripts that are statistically underpowered, are likely to be rejected without peer re view. This applies in particular to studies of genetic associations, which will be considered only if they contribute new insights and are statistically valid according to generally accepted criteria. Articles which are likely to affect the choice, perform ance or interpretation of clinical tests will be favored over those which do not, and animal or cell -culture studies need to justify their eligibility. Reporting of negative results must be justified by prior evidence that a positive result would be expect ed. Manuscripts are also returned to authors if they do not comply with the Information for Authors (e.g., if the number of words al - lowed for a certain article type will be exceeded). Unpublished material Submission of a manuscript to JCIM implies that the work described has not been published previously, except in the form of an abstract, academic thesis or lecture; that it is not under consideration for publication elsewhere; that publication of the work is approved by all authors and tacitly or explicit ly by the responsible authorities where the work was carried out; and that, if accepted, it will not be published elsewhere, in English, German, or in any other language, without the written consent of the Publisher. 2. Ethical conduct of research For information on plagiarism, please refer to COPE Committee on Publication Ethics . Please note that JCIM uses the check program \"iThenticate\" to assess for potential overlap in prior publication (s). Any previously published material must be referenced appropriately in the manuscript. Informed consent The protection of privacy is a legal right that must not be infringed without individual informed consent. In cases where the identification of personal information is necessary for scientific reasons, authors should obtain full documentation of informed cons ent, including written permission from the patient or their legal guardians prior to inclusion in the study. The following (or similar) statement should be included in the Materials and methods section: Informed consent was obtained from all individuals in cluded in this study. Authorization for the use of human subjects Manuscripts containing information related to human use should clearly state that the research complies with all relevant national regulations and institutional policies and has been approve d by the authors' Institutional Review Board or any equivalent Committee. Copies of the guidelines and policy statements must be available for review by the Managing Editor if necessary. The editors reserve the right to seek additional information or guida nce from reviewers on any cases in which concerns arise. All investigations with human subjects must have been conducted by following the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki , what is more authors must identify the committee or review board approving the experiments, and provide a statement indicating approval of the research. The following (or similar) statement s hould be included in the Methods section: Ethical approval: The research related to human use has been complied with all the relevant national regulations, institutional policies and in accordance the tenets of the Helsinki Declaration, and has been approv ed by the authors' institutional review board or equivalent committee. Authorization for the use of experimental animals Manuscripts containing information related to animals use should clearly state that the research has complied with all relevant national regulations and institutional policies and has been approved by the authors' institutional review board or equivalent committee. Copies of the guidelines and policy statements must be available for review by the Managing Editor if necessary. The editors reserve the right to seek additional information or guidance from reviewers on any cases in which concerns arise. The re search using animal subjects should be conducted according to the Principles of Laboratory Animal Care and similar documents (e.g. NIH). For manuscripts reporting experiments on live vertebrates or higher invertebrates, authors must identify the committee approving the experiments, and must confirm that all experiments were performed in accordance with relevant regulations. The following (or similar) statement should be included in the Methods secti on: Ethical approval: The research related to animals use has been complied with all the relevant national regulations and institutional policies for the care and use of animals. If the manuscript does not contain any study that requires human or animal et hical approval, the following statement should be included in the Methods section: Ethical approval: The conducted research is not related to either human or animals use. Conflict of interest and author contributions A conflict of interest for a given manuscript exists when a participant in the peer review and publication process - author, reviewer, and editor - has ties to activities that could inappropriately influence his or her judgment, regardless of whether judgm ent is, in fact, affected. Financial relationships with industry (for example, employment, consultancies, stock ownership, honoraria, expert testimony), either directly or through immediate family, are usually considered the most important conflicts of int erest. However, conflicts can occur for other reasons, such as financial support of the study, ties to health insurance, politics or other stakeholders, personal relationships, academic competition, and intellectual passion. To ensure fair and objective d ecision -making, authors must declare any associations that pose a conflict of interest (financial, personal or professional) in connection with the manuscript under evaluation. This must be declared during the submission process and also at the end of the the manuscript. If you have no declaration to make, please insert None declared . The below mentioned statement should be included before the Reference section (or after the Acknowledgments section, if applicable). Authors must also declare responsibility f or the entire content of the manuscript and may declare individual contributions of each author, if applicable. Acknowledgments: (If applicable). Research funding: Declaration or None declared. Author contributions: All the authors have accepted responsibility for the entire content of this manuscript and approved submission. Competing interests: Authors state no conflict of inte rest. Informed consent : Informed consent was obtained from all ind ividuals included in this study or Not applicable. Ethical approval: Declaration or The local Institutional Review Board deem ed the study exempt from review/Not applicable. Copyright Manuscripts are accepted on condition of transfer of copyright (for U.S. government employees: to the extent transferable) to the publisher. Once the manuscript has been accepted, it may not be published elsewhere without the consent of the copyright holders.
