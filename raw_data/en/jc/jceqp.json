The global incidence of DM has been gradually increasing due to improvements in living standards and changes in dietary habits, making it a major non-communicable disease that poses a significant threat to human health and life. The pathogenesis of DM remains incompletely understood till now, and current pharmacotherapeutic interventions are largely inadequate, resulting in relapses and severe adverse reactions. Although DM is not explicitly mentioned in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) theory and clinical practice, it is often classified as \"Xiaoke\" due to similarities in etiology, pathogenesis, and symptoms. With its overall regulation, multiple targets, and personalized medication approach, TCM treatment can effectively alleviate the clinical manifestations of DM and prevent or treat its complications. Furthermore, TCM exhibits desirable therapeutic effects with minimal side effects and a favorable safety profile. This paper provides a comprehensive comparison and contrast of Xiaoke and DM by examining the involvement of TCM in their etiology, pathogenesis, treatment guidelines, and other relevant aspects based on classical literature and research reports. The current TCM experimental research on the treatment of DM by lowering blood glucose levels also be generalized. This innovative focus not only illuminates the role of TCM in DM treatment, but also underscores the potential of TCM in DM management. Background According to the 10th edition of the Global Diabetes Map, 537 million adults were diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (DM) worldwide in 2021, and this number is expected to rise to 643 and 783 million in 2030 and 2045, respectively [ [1](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR1)]. A recent study on the prevalence and treatment of DM in China between 2013 and 2018 revealed that the prevalence in Chinese adults had increased from 10.95 to 12.4%. This trend is thought to be dues to an overall rise in DM risk factors, such as unhealthy diets, lack of physical activity, smoking, alcohol consumption, and obesity and overweight [ [2](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR2), [3](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR3)]. Studies have demonstrated that Chinese people have weaker -cell functionality and a high prevalence of obesity that is concomitant with insulin resistance (IR), contributing to the weak -cell function which leads to an increase in the prevalence of DM [ [4](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR4)]. The classification of DM includes type 1 (T1DM), type 2 (T2DM), or gestational (GDM), as well as distinct forms such as type 3 (T3DM) and type 3c (T3cDM) DM. T2DM accounts for 90% of all DM cases in the Chinese population. According to the Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in China (2020 Edition), the awareness (36.5%), treatment (32.2%), and control rates (49.2%) of DM in China have improved; however, those percentages remain relatively low [ [5](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR5)]. The treatment strategy for DM is not only limited to reducing blood glucose, but also includes the control of blood pressure, blood lipids, and body weight; antiplatelet therapy; and lifestyle improvement. Treatment should follow the principles of individualized medicine; however, the current hypoglycemic drugs are both unsatisfactory in their therapeutic effects and not well-tolerated, and they cannot meet the needs of personalized treatment. The merits of TCM include treatment based on syndrome differentiation and a holistic view. Results from drug therapy, acupuncture, moxibustion, diet control, and other affiliated therapies, sufficiently demonstrate the efficacy of TCM in the overall regulation and treatment of multiple targets and in providing personalized medication. TCM can significantly ameliorate the clinical symptoms of DM and effectively prevent and treat its complications, which has been a common strategy for managing chronic metabolic disorders typified by DM. No relevant description of DM can be found in TCM theory and clinical practice. Therefore, DM is often classified as \"Xiaoke\". However, despite similarities between Xiaoke and DM regarding etiology, pathogenesis, and symptoms, the two diseases are not identical. Previous studies have frequently addressed Xiaoke and DM, but a comprehensive comparison of their similarities and differences has been lacking. Drawing on classical literature and contemporary research on TCM's efficacy in treating these conditions, this paper presents theoretical considerations, methodological innovations, and clinical applications as the epistemological foundations of TCM treatment for Xiaoke and DM. This is not only illuminates the role of TCM in DM treatment, but also underscores the potential of TCM in DM management. DM stemming from Xiaoke based on TCM principles According to TCM theory, DM falls under the category of Xiaoke. Xiaoke, the disease was first named in The Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic (Huang Di Nei Jing) [ [6](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR6)]. The character pattern and meaning of Xiaoke indicate that the disease is closely related to water metabolism. Patients suffering from this condition experience dry mouth, abnormal water distribution within their body, and pathological changes in their metabolism [ [7](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR7)]. In the medical practices of past dynasties, TCM physicians deepened their understanding of Xiaoke and gradually developed a more comprehensive understanding of its etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment. Pre-Qin and Han dynasties (pre-A.D.220): academic origin of Xiaoke In the Yin and Shang dynasties, oracle bone inscriptions described the \"urinary disease\", which is probably the earliest record of \"Xiaoke\" [ [8](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR8)]. The earliest medical book, Prescriptions for Formulas for Fifty-two Diseases (Wu Shi Er Bing Fang), details the symptoms associated with Xiaoke. Huang Di Nei Jing not only classified and named this disease but also provided additional records on its clinical symptoms, etiology, treatment, prognosis, and taboos practices, which indicates a theoretical foundation for preventing Xiaoke and the emergence of dietary therapy in later generations. Jin Gui Yao Lve represents the pioneering application of syndrome differentiation in TCM treatment for Xiaoke, which has continued to inform modern therapeutic strategies. Wei, Jin, Sui, and Tang dynasties (A.D.220 to A.D.907): academic development of Xiaoke The Ancient and Modern Records of Proven Formulas (Gu Jin Lu Yan Fang) was the first to record patients with Xiaoke who had sweet urine, which was a breakthrough in the diagnosis of Xiaoke [ [9](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR9)]. Arcane Essentials from the Imperial Library (Wai Tai Mi Yao) quoted from Gu Jin Lu Yan Fang and elaborated on the characteristics of Xiaoke, and divided it into three categories: Xiaoke, Xiaozhong and Xiaoshen [ [10](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR10)]. The five dynasties and Liao and Song dynasties (A.D.907 to A.D.1115): academic accumulation period of Xiaoke Official medical books of the Song dynasty such as Formulas from Benevolent Sages Compiled during the Taiping Era (Tai Ping Sheng Hui Fang) and Comprehensive Recording of Divine Assistance (Sheng Ji Zong Lu) contain a plethora of theories and prescriptions that have been used in the treatment of Xiaoke. Tai Ping Sheng Hui Fang first explicitly proposes the term \"Sanxiao\", which are respectively for Xiaoke, Xiaozhong, and Xiaoshen, including modern Shangxiao (focus on the lungs), Zhongxiao (focus on the stomach), and Xiaxiao (focus on the kidneys) [ [11](#ref-CR11), [12](#ref-CR12), [13](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR13)]. Jin and Yuan dynasties (A.D.1115 to A.D.1368): academic contention period of Xiaoke During the Sui and Tang dynasties, the kidneys were deemed the main target for the treatment of Xiaoke. In contrast, in the Song, Jin, and Yuan dynasties, it was proposed that the disease should be located according to the Sanxiao term. The most prominent medical teachers in the Jin and Yuan dynasties were Liu Wansu, Zhang Congzheng, Li Dongyuan, and Zhu Danxi, who presented unique perspectives on the comprehension and treatment of Xiaoke. [ [14](#ref-CR14), [15](#ref-CR15), [16](#ref-CR16), [17](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR17)]. Ming and Qing dynasties (A.D.1368 to A.D.1912): blooming academic period of Xiaoke New classification methods have emerged, for example, Zhang Jingyue classified Xiaoke as Yinxiao and Yangxiao while Qin Jingming broadly classified Xiaoke due to exogenous affection and internal damage [ [18](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR18)]. Furthermore, the efficacy of Xiaoke treatment has been significantly enhanced by establishing a syndrome differentiation-based therapeutic system that advocates for warming and nourishing kidney Yang, as well as increasing the application of Qi and blood theory in Xiaoke treatment. In terms of nursing care for Xiaoke, Fang Yu in the Ming dynasty especially pointed out that patients with Xiaoke should \"drink more water freely\" [ [19](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR19)]. The Republic of China (A.D.1912 to A.D.1949): academic collision period between Xiaoke and DM The concept of diabetes mellitus (DM) in Western medicine (WM) was first introduced to China during the Republic of China era. In TCM, it is believed that DM corresponds to Xiaoke symptoms, which may have originated from the Records of Chinese Medicine with Reference to Western Medicine (Yi Xue Zhong Zhong Can Xi Lu), written by Zhang Xichun [ [20](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR20)]. Zhang created a novel prescription named the Zicui decoction, which transformed the pancreatic lesions recognized at that time into \"involving the spleen, thereby affecting the lung and kidney.\" During the Republic of China period, the treatment method continued to be based on Xiaoke and followed traditional Xiaoke treatment experiences [ [21](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR21)]. Modern times (A.D.1949 to present): the initial academic period considering Xiaoke and DM Professor Tong Xiaolin's \"type-stage-syndrome differentiation\" method, which combines disease with syndromes, is widely used in DM or Xiaoke treatment [ [22](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR22)]. Yue Rensong et al. proposed a classification of DM and its complications into three stages: early, middle, and late. Zhou Kai et al. divided the occurrence and development of DM into four stages: primitive, prodromal, diabetic, and retrogressive. In addition, the authors also put forward the theory of combining physiques with stages [ [23](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR23)]. In TCM, Xiaoke is considered the initial etiology of DM, and the systematic understanding of DM in TCM starts from Xiaoke (summarized in Fig. [1](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#Fig1)). Modern TCM views Yin deficiency and dry heat as the primary pathogeneses of DM, with Yin deficiency being the cause and dry heat being the outer phenomenon. The specific details will be further elaborated in the following section. The role of TCM in the etiology and pathogenesis of DM Etiology of DM according to TCM Understanding the etiology of DM began with a discussion of Xiaoke in Huang Di Nei Jing. Considering the research and summaries of physicians in past dynasties, the etiology of Xiaoke is divided into hereditary and acquired factors. Hereditary factors, namely genetic factors, include weakness of the organs and insufficient endowment; acquired factors are classified as exogenous affections and internal damage. The primary etiological factors of exogenous affection include wind, cold, heat, dampness, dryness and fire. Conversely, the primary causes of internal damage are uncontrolled diet and indulgence in sexual activities that lead to the depletion of kidney essence, as well as emotional disorders. Pathogenesis of DM according to TCM Pathogenesis of the internal organs (Sanxiao theory) Sanxiao is classified according to the location of diseased internal organs. Shangxiao indicates afflictions in the lungs and heart, Zhongxiao pertains to disorders in the spleen, stomach, liver, and gallbladder, while Xiaxiao denotes issues with the kidneys and bladder. The Shangxiao pathogenesis is typically heart fire and lung dryness. Zhongxiao is characterized by spleen heat and liver Qi stagnation. Patients with Zhongxiao exhibit increased appetite and frequent hunger due to heat stagnation in the spleen and stomach. The primary pathogenesis of Xiaxiao is attributed to kidney deficiency. Therefore, compromised renal function in DM patients is not only a pathogenic factor but also a pathological outcome. Heat syndrome in the upper energizer causes thirst in patients resulting in hyperhydration, and the deficiency of Yin brings internal heat to the lower energizer, resulting in polyuria [ [24](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR24)]. Pathogenesis theory of Qi, blood, and bodily fluids Qi, blood, and bodily fluids are generated by internal organs and physiological processes. These substances serve as the foundation for human life activities. According to the theories of body fluid and Qi and blood, pathological changes in these substances play a crucial role in the development of Xiaoke. The theory of bodily fluids describes \"bodily fluids\" as a collective term to represent all forms of water and fluids in the body, including the fluid within the internal organs, bodies, and orifices and their normal secretions. Xiaoke's pathogenesis can be attributed to insufficient bodily fluids or impaired transport and transformation thereof. Bodily fluid metabolism is closely linked with all internal organs; dysfunction in any one organ may result in abnormal metabolism and subsequent complications. The theory of Qi and blood stipulate that Qi and blood are the essential elements that constitute the human body and maintain human life activities. They originate from the five organs and serve as a power source for all internal physiological functions. According to Xiaoke pathogenesis, Yin deficiency is fundamental while dryness-heat is incidental. Overconsumption of Qi can deplete Yin and negatively impact organ function. If left uncorrected for an extended period, this condition may result in a deficiency of Qi and blood, as well as impaired organ function, ultimately impacting the circulation of Qi and blood [ [25](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR25)]. Modern theory: stage-type theory The \"stage-syndrome differentiation\" method is commonly employed by scholars to categorize the stages and syndromes of DM. For example, Professor Tong Xiaolin divided DM into two categories, Pidan and Xiaodan. Obesity-related DM (obesity-DM) is in the Pidan category, which is common in patients with DM at this stage. While the typical development process of obesity-DM follows an \"obesity or overweight-Pidan-Xiaoke/DM-Xiaoke complications\" pathway, corresponding to most cases in T2DM. Emaciation DM falls under the Xiaodan category and encompasses T1DM, type 1.5 diabetes (LADA), and certain cases of T2DM in modern medicine. The pathogenesis underlying this form of DM is characterized by \"Xiaodan-Xiaoke/DM-Xiaoke complications\". Presently, the Guidelines for Clinical Evidence-Based Practice of TCM in Diabetes classify DM into three stages: pre-DM, DM, and DM complications [ [26](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR26)]. Pre-DM stage The pre-diabetes mellitus stage encompasses Qi, blood, phlegm, fire, dampness and food that contribute to the development of the disease. Impaired digestion is the foundation for Qi stagnation. Prolonged consumption of fatty, sweet and pungent foods or chronic spleen deficiency can lead to reduced digestive function in both the spleen and stomach resulting in abdominal distension. Stagnation in the spleen and stomach generates phlegm, which transforms into heat and eventually develops into Pidan. Emotional frustration rapidly induces stagnation of liver Qi, whose function is to regulate the flow of Qi. With stagnant liver Qi, blood circulation is impeded and body fluid circulation becomes poor, leading to internal organ stagnation and ultimately resulting in phlegm dampness. Phlegm dampness may lead to spleen dysfunction, resulting in Pidan. According to modern medical experts, complications during the pre-diabetes stage are typical of the Pidan category. Although early syndromes of DM vary, Yin deficiency and dry heat are considered the main manifestations [ [27](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR27)]. DM stage DM is characterized by heat, deficiency, Qi stagnation and food indigestion that is later converted to heat. It involves internal organs, primarily liver and stomach heat, as well as lung and intestinal heat. If the dryness-heat lingers for an extended period, it eventually leads to a deficiency of Qi, blood, Yin, and Yang [ [28](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR28)]. In the TCM clinical practice, DM is classified as dryness-heat caused by deficiencies in Yin, both Qi and Yin, or both Yin and Yang, which corresponds to the early, middle, and late stages of DM, respectively. Among these classifications, the Qi and Yin deficiency corresponds to the main stage of DM. The pathogenesis of DM can be divided into deficiency and excess syndromes. The former manifests as Qi, Yin, and Yang deficiency while the latter primarily manifests as blood stasis and phlegm turbidity. DM chronic complication stage Types of common chronic DM complications are diabetic foot (DF), diabetic nephropathy (DN), diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), and diabetic retinopathy (DR). Tong Xiaolin et al. suggested that most complications occur in the stage of \"damage\" [ [29](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR29)]. At this stage, deficiency of Qi and Yin, water dampness, phlegm turbidity, and blood stasis are intertwined, and the flow of Qi and blood are turbulent; thus, pathogenic factors block the vessels, which is the key pathogenesis of early complications of DM [ [30](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR30)]. The pathogenesis of the various complications differs. Deficiency in Qi and Yin is the underlying cause of DF, while dryness-heat, blood stasis, and phlegm turbidity are incidental factors [ [31](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR31)]. DN results from a combination of deficiency in both Qi and Yin with blood stasis [ [32](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR32)]. DPN can be attributed to fundamental deficiency along with incidental excess in blood stasis and phlegm turbidity [ [33](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR33)]. DR is caused by a deficiency in Yin [ [34](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR34)]. However, the integration of the organs and imbalances in Qi and blood functions can exacerbate the \"damage\". Therefore, it is crucial to prevent and treat early complications of DM holistically by regulating the five organs to restore body functions [ [35](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR35)]. In summary, the systemic understanding of DM in TCM varies from local to general disease location and various stage-syndrome classifications. The disease location, course, etiology, and pathogenesis of DM are systematized and comprehensive. The systematic understanding of DM in TCM begins with Xiaoke. With extensive knowledge of pathogenic factors, such as phlegm dampness, blood stasis, and emotion, a holistic understanding of the pathogenesis and changes in Qi, blood, and bodily fluids has been achieved (summarized in Fig. [2](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#Fig2)). Treatment based on syndrome differentiation in Xiaoke has advanced from a discussion of the treatment of Sanxiao to the whole. Moreover, from the perspective of Qi, blood, bodily fluids, and emotions, starting from aspects of blood stasis, phlegm dampness, dampness-heat, and emotion, the treatment of DM is considered more comprehensively and a regimen based on syndrome differentiation has been established. In modern times, TCM incorporates WM diagnoses and pharmacological therapies, and the diagnosis of DM is based on the stage-syndrome classification. Although scholars have classified Xiaoke or DM according to the stage-type disease development process, its pathogenesis is summarized as Yin deficiency and dry heat. TCM treatment guidelines for DM With the deepening understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of DM in TCM, its treatment guidelines are gradually improved. The treatment guidelines are refined based on the pathogenesis described by Sanxiao theory, Qi, blood, and bodily fluids theory and stage-type theory. Treatment based on internal organs/Sanxiao The primary pathogenesis of Xiaoke is attributed to Yin and body fluid deficiency as well as excessive dryness-heat. Therefore, its treatment principle involves clearing heat, moistening dryness, nourishing Yin and generating fluids. According to the distinct pathological characteristics of Shangxiao, Zhongxiao, and Xiaxiao, ancient physicians proposed the following treatment principles: When treating patients with Shangxiao, it is appropriate to moisten their lungs while simultaneously clearing the heat in their stomach. When treating patients with Zhongxiao, it is preferable to clear the heat in their stomach while also nourishing their kidneys. Finally, when treating patients with Xiaxiao, it is suitable to nourish their kidneys and tonify their lungs. Treatment based on Qi, blood, and bodily fluids Xiaoke is regarded as a disorder of Qi function that disrupts the normal flow of Qi and blood, leading to excessive dryness-heat in the body. This results in fluid depletion, causing turbulent blood circulation and vessel blood stasis. The primary treatment principle focuses on replenishing Qi, promoting blood circulation, eliminating blood stasis, clearing heat, resolving phlegm, and strengthening spleen dampness [ [36](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR36), [37](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR37)]. Treatment based on stages Pre-DM stage: Depression syndrome such as liver depression and Qi stagnation, and stagnation of spleen and stomach Qi may occur. The three major treatment strategies to restore a normal distribution of liver Qi and homeostatic function of ascending and descending spleen and stomach Qi are regulating liver Qi, strengthening spleen Qi, and lowering stomach Qi [ [38](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR38)]. DM stage: DM primarily involves stagnated heat and deficiency syndromes. At this stage of heat, the treatment methods in addition to clearing away heat and purging fire, should be nourishing Qi and Yin [ [39](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR39)]. In the deficiency stage, the treatment method is to clear heat, activate blood circulation, replenish Qi, and nourish the blood. The method that entails strengthening body resistance and correcting deficiency should be applied appropriately according to each case. DM chronic complication stage: This DM stage is similar to the \"damage\" described by Xiaolin et al., which is characterized by several types of complications. In DF, the predominant syndrome is the deficiency of both Qi and Yin, which should be treated by replenishing Qi, nourishing Yin, activating blood circulation, and removing blood stasis [ [32](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR32)]. For DN, the deficiency in Qi and Yin should be addressed by simultaneously stimulating both Qi and Yin [ [40](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR40)]. The primary treatment for DPN involves promoting blood circulation and removing obstruction in the collaterals [ [39](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR39)]. As for DR, treatment strategies include replenishing Qi, nourishing Yin, tonifying the liver and kidneys, promoting blood circulation, removing blood stasis, dispelling pathogenic wind, and brightening the eyes [ [41](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR41)]. The initial stage of the disease is characterized by a combined depression in different aspects. The use of pungent and bitter herbs for dispersion and purgation, respectively, facilitates Qi flow and resolves phlegm. Prolonged depression can transform into heat. For patients with stagnant heat in the liver and stomach, it is more effective to alleviate depression and clear heat in the stomach. For those with excessive heat, bitter and sour drugs are recommended for glucose control. Dryness-heat can impair Yin and eventually lead to Qi, blood, Yin, and Yang deficiencies. Therefore, reinforcing Qi, nourishing blood, replenishing Yin, tonifying Yang, and moistening dryness are necessary. The treatment guidelines for DM are gradually improving due to the continuous development and synergy between TCM and WM, which can vary depending on the patients during some stages of DM. Thus, treatment guidelines and strategies focus on alleviating deficiency and dryness-heat to nourish Yin and restore fluids regardless of the condition, DM or Xiaoke. Similarities and differences between Xiaoke and DM There are similarities between Xiaoke and DM in the definitions, classifications, etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment, although not entirely consistent. In terms of disease name definitions and classifications, Xiaoke is a TCM term that refers to a condition characterized by polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, weight loss, asthenia, and sweet urine, which is classified as Shangxiao, Zhongxiao, and Xiaxiao. DM is a WM disease name, referring to a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia and caused by absolute or relative insufficient secretion of insulin and/or IR, which is classified into the pre-DM, DM, and DM chronic complication stages. Although both conditions are related to factors such as heredity, diet, and exogenous damage to the body and emotion, the etiology of TCM is thought to involve all factors causing an imbalance in Yin and Yang. The etiology of Xiaoke includes hereditary factors such as insufficient endowment and weakness of the five zang-organs, acquired factors such as improper diet resulting in the accumulation of heat and damage to bodily fluids, disordered emotions causing the poor function of Qi, and excessive physical and sexual activities. The exogenous etiology of DM is more specific and includes risk factors such as an unhealthy diet, insufficient physical exercise, smoking, and alcohol consumption. IR is confounded by risk factors such as being overweight or obese. Regarding the pathogenesis, dryness-heat caused by a deficiency in Yin is apparent in both diseases; however, DM is a complex metabolic condition. In the early stages of DM, there is typically no Yin deficiency, some patients with DM do not have common symptoms such as \"three mores and one less\" (polydipsia, polyphagia, polyuria, and weight loss). In terms of diagnosis, Xiaoke is based on the presence of \"Sanxiao\" symptoms in patients. Early in the disease progression, typical Xiaoke manifestations include \"three mores and one less\" or sweet urine, similar to T1DM; during the pathological state, thirst and the desire to drink as well as frequent urination become the more prevalent symptoms, as in diabetes insipidus, hyperthyroidism, hyperaldosteronism, mental polydipsia, and polyuria, and other diseases in modern medicine [ [42](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR42)]. Therefore, Xiaoke can only be diagnosed when patients with DM present with symptoms like \"three mores and one less\" [ [43](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR43)]. The diagnostic criteria of DM include hyperglycemia and urinary glucose as the gold standard. The initial stage of DM consists of the excess syndrome and is characterized by \"slow and stagnated Qi in the spleen and abnormal digestion and transportation,\" which is related to Pidan. It progresses to Xiaoke when the \"three mores and one less\" symptoms appear, in association with \"Xiaozhong,\" kidney dryness, Gexiao, and \"Xiaoke\". The \"Xiaoke\" stage is the progression from excess to deficiency or a mixture of poverty and excess, and the basic pathogenesis is dryness-heat due to a lack of Yin. During the DM complication stage, the organs are impaired and exhibit carbuncles, abscesses, and cataracts. These chronic complications of DM are remarkably similar to those of Xiaoke. Many patients do not have symptoms in the early stage, but their blood glucose is elevated when measured during physical examination. If the disease progresses to a Xiaoke state of \"three mores and one less\", most patients would be diagnosed with middle or late stage-DM; thus, Xiaoke cannot be compared to modern DM. For DM, in the initial stage of TCM, the \"syndrome differentiation of Sanxiao\" is mainly used, and then the \"symptom stage-type\" is established [ [22](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR22)]. Although this varies among individuals, the general treatment methods for Xiaoke involve removing heat, nourishing Yin, invigorating Qi, promoting bodily fluid production, benefiting Yin, supporting Yang, promoting blood circulation, and removing blood stasis. However, DM is treated with hypoglycemic Chinese and Western medicines. Although Xiaoke and DM overlap, they cannot be considered the same condition owing to the incongruency between them. A diagnosis of DM cannot replace a diagnosis of Xiaoke. The foundation and similarities and differences between Xiaoke and DM according to TCM are summarized in Fig. [3](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#Fig3). Research advances in the mechanism of TCM treatment for DM Modern research studies have shown that IR is the core mechanism of DM pathogenesis and it plays a vital role in the formation of DM. IR refers to a decrease in the effect of insulin on its target tissues, such as the brain, heart, liver, kidney, and skeletal muscle. The factors causing IR include: inflammation of the central nervous system, increased inflammation mediated by macrophages, increased concentrations of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-), activation of the nuclear factor-B (NF-B) pathway, altered mitochondrial dynamics, increased levels of circulating fatty acids, and lipid accumulation in the muscles and liver [ [44](#ref-CR44), [45](#ref-CR45), [46](#ref-CR46), [47](#ref-CR47), [48](#ref-CR48), [49](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR49)]. Experimental that TCM reduces IR through multi-target action and has an apparent advantage in treating DM and chronic complications. Modern research findings provide crucial theoretical support and a clinical basis for the clinical application of TCM. Its mechanism of action can be summarized as either stimulating cells to secrete insulin or increasing the number of insulin receptors, improving responsiveness and affinity, or inhibiting the secretion of insulin antagonists and promoting glucose degradation, which ultimately improves IR. TCM treatment for DM can effectively control blood glucose and reduce target organ damage by alleviating the effects of IR [ [50](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR50)]. TCM in the treatment of DM includes many means, such as single Chinese herbal medicine, TCM compound, traditional chinese patent medicines and simple preparations, chinese medicine external treatment, acupuncture and moxibustion, and sports therapy (also including Taijiquan and Baduanjin). Chinese herbal medicines that are medicine and food homologies, such as Coptidis Rhizoma, and their proven prescriptions, small compound prescriptions, active parts, and monomer components, have unique advantages for safety and effectiveness in the treatment of DM, which have been commended in recent years. Specific research examples are described below. Study on a single Chinese herbal medicine The compositions of Chinese herbal medicines are complex. Chemical compositions and pharmacological activity of these medicines have been studied in the treatment of DM, combined with modern separation and analysis methods. Studies have mainly focused on Astragali has the following functions: lowers blood glucose, lowers lipids, has an anti-inflammatory effect, and improves islet function [ [51](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR51)]. The main ingredients are flavonoids, and triterpenes. Astragalus polysaccharide can reduce glycosylated hemoglobin levels, blood glucose, and serum insulin. It can decrease the level of endoplasmic reticulum stress, improve the functional morphology of islets, and increase the number of islet cells in DM rat models, to inhibit or delay apoptosis of the islet and protect its function. Astragaloside IV in Astragali Radix can reduce blood glucose, increase insulin sensitivity, and improve IR [ [52](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR52)]. It also has a specific protective effect on the kidneys and can reduce DN fibrosis [ [53](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR53)]. It can also increase the activity of fork-head box transcription factor 1 by inhibiting the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) signaling pathway, which slows down the injury of renal tissue in patients with DM [ [54](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR54), [55](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR55)].

Similarly, Ginsenoside Rh2 can stimulate nerve endings to release acetylcholine, activating islet cell M receptors and promoting insulin secretion. In alloxan DM mice treated with Ginsenoside Rb3, the degree of damage to the islet tissue was reduced, and cell morphology and structure were normal. In addition, Ginsenoside Rb1 also enhances the activity of islet cells [ [62](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR62)].

It can also improve cardiac function; enhance the sensitivity of T2DM rats to exogenous insulin and the content of hepatic glycogen and skeletal muscle glycogen in blood; and significantly reduce the renal failure index, urinary albumin excretion rate, and pathological injury of pancreatic tissue in T2DM rats. Prescription studies Owing to the complexity of the patient's condition and the diversity of the pathogenesis, single-agent prescriptions have the disadvantage of limited efficacy and weak drug potency. TCM compound prescriptions under accurate syndrome differentiation are more suitable for clinical practice in complex pathogenesis and known diseases and syndromes. Classic compound prescriptions have promising therapeutic effects in DM, as described below. Baihu decoction originates from the Treatise on Cold Damage (Shang Han Lun), written by Zhang Zhongjing in the Eastern Han Dynasty. It comprises Gypsum non-glutinous rice. It functions by reducing heat, generating body fluids, regulating blood glucose and lipid metabolism, reducing islet cell load, alleviating IR, and promoting insulin sensitivity.

Further, this decoction can reduce body weight, inhibit IR, ameliorate blood glucose and lipids dysregulation, improve peripheral neuropathy, and promote the conduction velocity of sensory nerves and motor nerves in patients. It can also reduce high-risk cardiovascular factors, myocardial and renal function damage, and macro and microvascular diseases, as well as delay the incidence and development of DM complications. Moreover, it can also modify insulin signal transduction. Experimental studies (in vivo and in vitro) have reported that Erchen decoction and its modified prescriptions can attenuate IR by acting on the IRS-1/PI3K/Akt signaling pathways in hepatocytes [ [106](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR106)].

Yu'nv decoction comes from The Complete Works of [Zhang] Jing-Yue (Jing Yue Quan Shu), written by Zhang Jingyue in the Ming Dynasty, and is composed It functions by clearing stomach heat, nourishing kidney Yin, lowering blood glucose, anti-inflammation, and anti-ventricular remodeling. In antipyretic and anti-inflammatory effects. Anemarrhenae Rhizoma can lower blood glucose, reduce IR and blood lipid levels, and prevent atherosclerosis. Both diphenylpyrones mangiferin and neomangiferin in Anemarrhenae Rhizoma glucose levels and ameliorate T2DM symptoms. The flavonoid chemical constituents in Rehmanniae Radix have anti-inflammatory and antibacterial effects, and some glycosides can effectively lower blood glucose and improve blood lipid levels [ [66](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR66), [113](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR113)]. Berberine in Radix Achyranthis Videntatae can improve glucose uptake and utilization, and reduce fat production, glycogen decomposition, and gluconeogenesis [ [114](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR114)].

Through upregulating the expression 3B factor in Liuwei Dihuang decoction can promote Akt-mediated phosphorylation and activation, reduce the level of cAMP in cells, reduce the activity of protein kinase A, and ultimately reduce the hydrolysis of stored TG and the release of free fatty acids from adipocytes, to alleviate IR [ [118](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR118)]. Its water-extract and alcohol-soluble parts can promote the recovery of insulin signaling in adipose tissue and intervene in IR by upregulating the expression of the crucial gene insulin receptor substrate 2, and PI3K and Akt in PI3K/Akt signaling pathways in the adipose tissue of T2DM rats, thereby improving T2DM [ [119](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR119)]. In patients with T2DM, it can effectively reduce and maintain blood glucose levels, enhance the function of islet cells, and further improve the quality of life [ [120](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR120)]. The Jiaotai pill comes from the Han's Clear View of Medicine (Han Shi Yi Tong), written by Han Mao in the Ming Dynasty, which is composed of Coptidis Rhizoma and Cinnamomi Cortex. The Jiaotai pill is effective in the heart and kidneys and can treat insomnia caused by heart-kidney disharmony. Moreover, studies have found that the Jiaotai pill has therapeutic effects on T2DM [ [121](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR121)], which can protect pancreatic islet cells, promote insulin secretion [ [122](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR122)], inhibit IR [ [123](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR123)], regulate lipid metabolism by decreasing serum retinol-binding protein 4 levels and increasing glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) levels [ [126](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR126)]. Cinnamon extract increases glucose uptake in muscle and adipose tissues via GLUT4 production and transportation [ [127](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR127), [128](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR128)], inhibits glycogen synthase kinase 3 by promoting glycogen synthesis in the liver [ [129](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR129)], and lowers blood glucose levels by suppressing the gene expression of two gluconeogenic regulators in the liver [ [130](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR130)]. The modified prescription of Fenugreek pills is used in tonifying kidneys, strengthening Yang, and in the detoxification method proposed by Professor Lu Fuer through adding and subtracting a combination of the Fenugreek and Jiaotai pills, composed of and Cinnamaldehyde are studied more extensively and are reported to have an effect in elevating FBG levels and glucose and insulin tolerance. Concurrently, they can stimulate insulin secretion, increase insulin sensitivity, and alleviate the symptoms of diabetes and diabetic kidney disease. Most of these active ingredients produce a therapeutic effect through inhibiting oxidative stress and inflammation, and modifying the expression of related genes. While PI3K/AKT, ACC/CPT-1A and AMPK signaling pathways play important roles in these processes [ [131](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR131)]. Other therapies Acupuncture and moxibustion therapy, guided by the theoretical concepts of TCM with the efficacy of treatment based on syndrome differentiation, have recently been widely used in treating DM. These therapies lower blood glucose, reducing the level of inflammatory factors, and attenuate IR. Electroacupuncture at the following in T2DM rats, inhibit leptin resistance, and alleviate IR [ [132](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR132)]. Taijiquan is a recommended exercise in the Chinese Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Type 2 diabetes, as it has been shown to regulate glucose and lipid metabolism, reduce inflammation levels, improve obesity and overweight conditions, and enhance cardiopulmonary function [ [133](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR133)]. Preparation of T2DM models for research on the mechanism Modeling methods of WM In terms of DM animal models, WM has more established modeling strategies such as using chemicals to destroy islet cells in animals to create a model of DM or using streptozotocin (STZ) or alloxan to induce hyperglycemia in animals. To create a rat model of obesity and DM, rats were injected with low-dose STZ to induce slight damage to islet cells, resulting in abnormal glucose tolerance. As such, after feeding the animals a high calorie diet for 10 weeks, obese is induced confounded by hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and IR. Another type is the IR spontaneous diabetes animal model such as db/db and ob/ob mice, which have obesity and hyperinsulinemia similar to human T2DM. These animal models are often used to develop new oral drugs to treat DM and its complications [ [134](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR134)]. In addition, DM models simulating damaged human pancreatic cells are created in vitro; such a model of DM was induced using a modified medium that contained a precise dose of glucose to act on mouse islet cells or rat islet cell tumor cells [ [135](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR135), [136](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR136)]. The use of chemical substances to specifically destroy islet cells to induce DM is the most common modeling method because of its simplicity and high success rate. However, drugs that stimulate insulin secretion and insulin sensitizers have no hypoglycemic response in these models. There are many types of DM and the models achieve an experimental \"drug-induced\" DM simulation, and not actual clinical type of DM. Moreover, owing to the various etiologies, pathogeneses, and syndrome types in patients with T2DM/Xiaoke, there is currently no recognized animal model simulating TCM syndromes. Experimental studies often use spontaneous, induced, and transgenic animal models to simulate different syndromes of T2DM/Xiaoke. Modeling methods of TCM After consulting the literature, it is evident that most animal model strategies of TCM are based on the modeling methods of WM and auxiliary means to simulate the pathogenic progression of the disease in humans. A TCM`s DM model of the syndrome of phlegm dampness, blood stasis, and heat was established using seven specific pathogen-free (SPF) 8-week-old Sprague-Dawley (SD) male rats using a 45% calorie-ratio high-fat diet combined with restricted activity space [ [137](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR137)]. A TCM`s DM model of the syndrome of liver depression and spleen deficiency was established using SPF 6-week-old SD male rats fed fructose water and a high-fat diet. Simultaneously, the rats were bound in a supine position to restrict activity and prevent food and water intake for 3 h daily [ [138](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR138)]. Feng Hui et al. studied SPF db/db mice in the WM IR-type spontaneous DM animal model at 8-14 weeks. This type of rodent met the syndrome characteristics of excess Yang and heat in the early stage of Xiaoke, combined with the syndrome of phlegm dampness and Qi deficiency; at 14-16 weeks, these rats displayed characteristics of a deficiency in spleen Qi and accumulation of phlegm and dampness. At 16-20 weeks, it exhibited characteristics of insufficiency of both the spleen and kidneys and deficiency of both Qi and Yin in the middle and late stages of Xiaoke disease, combined with the manifestations of syndromes of kidney Yang deficiency and phlegm dampness [ [139](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR139)]. Lv Yiyan et al. used SPF ICR male mice that were each injected intraperitoneally with STZ solution for five consecutive days. The short-term model group was administered warm medicine on day 9 after the STZ injection. The long-term model group was administered the medicine for 35 consecutive days to establish the TCM`s DM model of internal heat Xiaoke syndrome [ [140](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR140)]. A few modeling strategies exist for creating DM animal models in TCM. The reason may be that TCM emphasizes treatment based on syndrome differentiation. TCM requires clinical practice and research is performed on humans rather than animals. For TCM, the pathogenesis of human conditions cannot be mimicked in animals owing to inter-species differences that make it challenging to simulate syndrome differentiation and its complexity. However, considering the associated ethical issues, it is not ethical to conduct the research in humans. Therefore, modeling methods for TCM rely on multiple disciplines, such as zoology and veterinary medicine that also use TCM [ [141](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR141)]. New methods and technologies for research on TCM and anti-DM mechanisms Recently, advancements have been made in the development of instrumental analyses and the introduction of systems biology platforms, multi-omics technologies (i.e., genomics), epigenetics, transcriptomics, proteomics, microbiomics, and metabolomics, as well as analyses methods, such as network pharmacology and bioinformatics. Multi-omics technology can reflect the interactions between various substances in biological systems, which is consistent with the perspectives of TCM in many aspects. They all emphasize the characteristics of the whole, connections, constant changes, and key factors. Therefore, these new methods have been gradually applied to study the pathogenesis of DM. Genomics Genomics is an interdisciplinary biological discipline for collective characterization, quantitative research, and comparative study of genomes in different organisms. It has since been applied to the study of DM. Through virtual screening of functional foods and analysis of their roles in regulating gene function, Afroz S et al. found that functional foods such zingiberis recens, Rhizoma curcumae longae, DM complications induced by coronavirus infection through the regulation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARG) and the TNF- genes in DM [ [142](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR142)]. Hu S et al. identified 1,366 DN-related differentially expressed genes from the GSE30528 dataset, including target genes, i.e., KCNH2, NCOA1, KDR, NR3C2, and ADRB2, and then explored the action mechanisms of Radix salviae miltiorrhizae in the treatment of DN [ [143](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR143)]. In a study by Zhao R et al., Pericarpium zanthoxyli showed a therapeutic effect on DM and comorbid conditions induced by oxidative stress when studying 280 intersecting genes and 105 signaling pathways and their related targets [ [144](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR144)]. Dong Y et al. through the data analysis of genes, found that Radix astragali-Chinese angelica compound can treat DN by acting on vascular endothelial growth factor A, tumor antigen p53, IL-6, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 1 [ [145](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR145)]. Genomics analysis has significantly contributed to related research on DM. Epigenetics Epigenetics is a branch of genetics that studies heritable changes in gene expression that do not change the DNA sequence, including DNA methylation, histone modification, non-coding RNA, genomic imprinting, maternal effects, and gene silencing. It is a molecular bridge that connects genes and the environment. In recent years, studies have confirmed that the interactions between genetic and environmental factors play an essential role in DM pathogenesis. Kim A et al. found that the combined treatment of luteolin and fisetin can inhibit the production of cytokines in monocytes under a specific dose of glucose through epigenetic modifications, such as NF-B activation and combination therapy may be a potential candidate for the treatment and prevention of DM and its complications [ [146](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR146)]. Lee W et al. reported that gallic acid may potentially treat and prevent DM and comorbid conditions by inhibiting hyperglycemia-induced cytokine production in monocytes through epigenetic changes in NF-B [ [147](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR147)]. While a study by Jiang H et al. showed that baicalin inhibits the incidence of T2DM liver tumors by regulating methyltransferase 3/N6-methyl adenylate/hexokinase domain protease three pathways to persistent changes in gene expression; its application will provide a new perspective for the study in the incidence and development of DM, and it provides new focus areas and ideas for the clinical treatment of DM [ [149](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR149)]. Transcriptomics Transcriptomics refers to a discipline that studies gene transcription and transcriptional regulation in cells. It has been used to further reveal the pathogenic molecular mechanisms of DM and its complications. Based on transcriptomic analysis, Folimu mori and Radix astragali can regulate the differentially expressed genes and proteins in the liver of STZ-induced DM mice, and the genes and enzymes involved in the chlorogenic acid biosynthesis pathway were identified [ [150](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR150)]. Wild silkworms can be used to treat DM [ [151](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR151)]. The curative effect of Huangqi Liuyi decoction in treating T2DM has [152](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR152)]. Berberine in Gegen Qinlian decoction reportedly reduces blood glucose levels in DM rat model [ [153](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR153)]. Mahongsu alleviated DN by activating podocyte protein phosphatase 2A [ [154](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR154)]. Biomarkers used in the treatment of DM wounds by Shengji Huayu prescription have been identified [ [155](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR155)]. Furthermore, 18 candidate drugs such as andrographolide, can be used to treat DR [ [156](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR156)]. Therefore, transcriptomics can be used to study the active state of DM genes in different tissue cells and at different periods to corroborate DM treatment strategies. Proteomics Proteomics is a science that takes the proteome as the research object and studies the protein composition and changes in cells, tissues, or organisms. The study of proteomics provides, not only a material basis for the principles of life activities, but also a theoretical basis and solutions for the elucidation and conquest of various disease mechanisms. As a new research method, it is widely used in the study of DM [ [157](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR157), [158](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR158)]. The Zuogui pill medicated serum can prevent or ameliorate DM and comorbid diseases by regulating associated protein pathways in a culture medium [ [159](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR159)]. Radix Trichosanthis and its protein components have hypoglycemic effects on DM mice by contributing in the insulin receptor pathway [ [160](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR160)]. A study on the action mechanisms of Chinese herbal medicines in treating DM was previously performed [ [161](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR161)]. A cell division control protein 42 homolog and the Ras homolog gene family member A were therapeutic targets of the Yiqi Yangyin Huatan Quyu prescription for T2DM [ [162](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR162)]. Quercetin potentially therapeutic effects on T2DM by targeting the MAPK signaling pathway [ [163](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR163)]. Ginseng can also treat DM and its complications by alleviating inflammation [ [164](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR164)]. Metabolomics Metabolomics is a research method that quantitatively analyzes all metabolites in organisms and identifies a way to investigate the relative relationship between metabolites and physiological and pathological modifications. This method is an integral part of systems biology and has been applied in the study of DM. Song L et al. studied the therapeutic effects of extracts from cortex phellodendri and angelica dahurica on STZ-induced gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) metabolomic profiling [ [165](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR165)]. Zhu Y et al. conducted a fecal metabolomics study on DM mice treated with Ophiopogonis Radix polysaccharide MDG-1 [ [166](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR166)]. Cui X et the mechanism of Scutellariae Radix and Coptidis Rhizoma to treat T2DM by studying plasma and urine [ [167](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR167)]. Qin Z et al. revealed the hypoglycemic effects of Rehmanniae Radix, and Coptidis Rhizoma and their combination on high-fat diet-induced DM mice by performing metabolomics analyses on serum samples [ [168](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR168)]. Wei H et al. found that urinary metabolomics combined with a personalized diagnosis under the guidance of TCM can determine subtypes of the pre-DM stage [ [169](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR169)]. Through metabolomic analyses of intestinal microbiota and DM mice feces, Li CN et al. found that the combination of berberine and stachyose-induced glucose metabolism is better than berberine alone [ [170](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR170)]. Yang L et al. used a non-targeted UPLC-LTQ-orbitrap metabolomics method to assess chemical characteristics of the extract and found that the Jinqi hypoglycemic preparation can alleviate T2DM [ [171](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR171)]. Zhou S et al. used a UHPLC-HRMS-based metabolomic method for chemical identification and confirmed that different varieties of Momordica charantia can be used to treat DM [ [172](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR172)]. Wang W et al. used a metabolomic method based on ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF/MS) to confirm the hypoglycemic effect of the Gegen Jiaotai pill on T2DM rats [ [173](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR173)]. Meng X et al. used metabolomic examinations and reported that the Tiaowei Chengqi decoction can regulate body fat content and the content of medium- and long-chain fatty acids in the pancreas of obese mice, and they also found that the Tiaowei Chengqi decoction can treat DM by preventing obesity, inhibiting inflammation, and regulating metabolism [ [174](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR174)]. Thus, metabolomics has unique advantages in the study of DM and its comorbid disorders. Microbiomics Microbiomics is the systematic study of the sum of all microorganisms and their interactions in a specific environment and has been widely used in DM research. Berberine [ [175](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR175), [176](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR176)], quercetin [ [177](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR177)], and the Shenqi compound [ [178](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR178)] can be used to treat metabolic diseases such as DM by regulating the gut microbiota and reducing intestinal glucose absorption. The effects of Baduanjin on the gut microbiota in patients with pre-DM stage was studied [ [179](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR179)]. The impact of Erchen decoction on the gut microbiota and lipid metabolism disorder in Zucker-type DM obese rats was assessed [ [180](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR180)]. Xiexin decoction can improve the symptoms in T2DM rats by regulating the gut microbiota [ [181](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR181)]. Quercetin exerts protective effects on STZ-induced DPN rats through regulating intestinal microbiota and active oxygen levels [ [182](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR182)]. Anemarrhenae Rhizoma can regulate intestinal microbiota and restore pancreatic function in DM rat models [ [183](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR183)]. The anti-DM activity of Scutellariae Radix Chengqi decoction can regulate the gut microbiota and improve the symptoms of DN mice [ [185](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR185)]. Microbiomics can be used to study the pathogenesis of DM by exploring modifications in intestinal microbiota as a strategy to develop treatments for DM. Network pharmacology Using systematic network pharmacology and molecular docking methods, the pharmacological mechanism and material basis of berberine [ [176](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR176)], Mori Folimu [ [186](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR186)] and the Xiaoke pill [ [187](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR187)] in the treatment of DM have been evaluated. The effective components and potential targets of the Liuwei Dihuang pill for the treatment of T2DM were predicted. The potential targets and molecular action mechanisms of Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix pill [ [189](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR189)] in the treatment of DN were studied. The mechanism of action of the Jiaotai pill in treating DM associated with depression was explored [ [190](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR190)]. Combined with a validation experiment, the mechanism of and taohong siwu decoction [ [192](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR192)] in the treatment of DR was revealed, and the effects and components of Chinese herbal medicines Rhizoma Coptidis and Rhizoma pinelliae on diabetic gastroparesis were observed [ [193](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR193)]. Through network pharmacology, a meta-analysis conducted to explore the potential molecular mechanisms of Rhizoma Polygonati in the treatment of DM and to provide a theoretical basis for the development and research of Chinese herbal medicines that are both medicines and food homologies for the treatment of DM [ [194](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR194)]. The anti-DM effect of the Chinese herbal medicine flavonoid compound was systematically studied [ [195](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR195)]. The safety and efficacy of TCM in treating T2DM patients were evaluated [ [196](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR196)]. Potential TCM and associated active ingredient mechanisms in the treatment of DM were analyzed [ [197](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR197)]. It was found that jinlida granules could improve blood glucose control and variability in newly diagnosed T2DM patients [ [198](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR198)]. Therefore, network pharmacology overcomes the limitations of traditional research methods, plays an essential role in the analysis of DM data, and provides the possibility for in-depth research on the action mechanisms and treatment methods of DM and other diseases. Conclusion and prospects With the advancements in living standards and changes in dietary patterns, the incidence rate of chronic metabolic diseases such as obesity, DM, hyperlipidemia, fatty liver disease, and osteoporosis is gradually increasing. Their harmfulness ranks second only to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and cancer, which adversely affect the quality of life. DM is one of the common chronic metabolic diseases. Currently, extensive research and consensus exist on the pharmacodynamic material basis and action mechanisms of TCM and WM in treating T1DM, T2DM, and GDM. However, only a few studies on DM are confounded by other metabolic diseases, such as T3DM and T3cDM. T3DM has similar symptoms to Alzheimer's disease and DM. The deposition of -amyloid peptide leads to a disorder of the insulin signal transduction pathway, resulting in the decline of insulin levels and IR, accompanied by apparent inflammatory mediator activation, oxidative stress, DNA damage, and mitochondrial dysfunction [ [199](#ref-CR199), [200](#ref-CR200), [201](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR201)]. T3cDM, also known as pancreatic-derived diabetes mellitus, refers to DM secondary to pancreatic damage, including pancreatitis and pancreatic trauma, tumor, cystic fibrosis, as well as hemochromatosis [ [202](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#ref-CR202)]. Based on his long-term experience in the treatment of DM, Tong Xiaolin suggested that T3cDM is clinically characterized by a syndrome of stagnation of heat in the liver and stomach, and a syndrome of Qi stagnation and blood stasis, which can be treated with a modified dachaihu decoction. However, since then, there has been no further breakthrough in the treatment and research of T3cDM in TCM and modern medicine. Therefore, it presents a new area of study and potential research avenues in the pathogenesis of new types of DM and discovering effective therapeutic drugs or prescriptions and their effective mechanisms in TCM. The treatment principles and methods of DM in TCM are derived from Xiaoke. Guided by the principle of TCM, the treatment is based on syndrome differentiation, internal organs/Sanxiao (Qi, blood, and bodily fluids) and the disease stage. The treatment methods vary for each individual and are mainly focused on removing heat and nourishing Yin, replenishing Qi, generating bodily fluids, supplementing Yin, supporting Yang, promoting blood circulation, and removing blood stasis. TCM-based treatments are characterized by multi-channels, multi-targets, multi-links, significant curative effects, and fewer side effects. TCM has unique advantages in preventing the occurrence, development, and progression of DM (summarized in Fig. [4](/articles/10.1186/s13020-023-00783-z#Fig4)). Further studies should focus on therapeutic drugs and related action mechanisms in DM treatments, from screening single drugs, proven prescriptions, simple compound prescriptions, active and monomeric components with multiple hypoglycemic mechanisms, and improving insulin receptor sensitivity. Moreover, studies should establish animal models using different mechanisms, select corresponding control drugs, and explore new drugs with reasonable hypoglycemic effects that can prevent and treat DM complications. However, screening critical signaling pathways and core targets of TCM in the treatment of DM and clarifying its mechanisms of action are challenges hindering the advancement of TCM in the study of DM.
