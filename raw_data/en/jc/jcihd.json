But one man, Hippocrates of [Cos](/wiki/Cos) (ca. 460 - 370 bce), [[3]](#cite_note-3) earned such respect and honor for the revolution he initiated in the principles and practice of medicine that his ideas flourished throughout Western history to the present day. His revolutionary ideas so changed the course of the development of [medicine](/wiki/Medicine) in [Western civilization](/wiki/Western_civilization) that the health and welfare of all humanity has benefited. Prologue Hippocrates of Cos revolutionized the practice of medicine by transforming it from its [mythical](/wiki/Myth), [superstitious](/wiki/index.php?title=Superstition&action=edit&redlink=1), [magical](/wiki/Magic) and [supernatural](/wiki/index.php?title=Supernatural&action=edit&redlink=1) roots to a new set of roots based on logical [reasoning](/wiki/index.php?title=Reason&action=edit&redlink=1) applied to methodical observation \u2014 the roots of [scientific](/wiki/Science) objectivity \u2014 roots that have nourished an ever-growing evolutionary tree of Western scientific medicine still flourishing. For that reason History has honored Hippocrates of Cos as \"The Father of Medicine\", medicine's progenitor. We might bestow on him the more precise cognomen, \"The Progenitor of Western Rational Medicine\". Historian Charles Singer goes a step further: We must remember that all the biological sciences were first studied because of their bearing on medicine. Hippocrates, therefore, might well be called also 'the father of biology'. [[4]] Because historians know only a little of the details of the life of Hippocrates, and because of the great influence the works associated with his name have had on medicine for millennia, his fame has led to a plethora of writings about him that have the character of [legend](/wiki/Legend): We still know very little about Hippocrates. And yet, like the physicians of Imperial Rome, the doctors of our days want to know all about the life of the \"Father of Medicine.\" Where there are no historical sources available, imagination will step in, and the poet will replace the historian. [[5]] The details \u2014 even basic facts \u2014 of Hippocrates' life remain contentious among modern classics scholars. An unfortunate dearth of contemporary 5th and 4th century bce historical information makes many questions about about the historical Hippocrates particularly knotty, and vexes the question of the relationship between the writings that have come down in Hippocrates' name, the [Hippocratic corpus](/wiki/index.php?title=Hippocratic_corpus&action=edit&redlink=1), and those works among the corpus that Hippocrates himself, rather than his followers, may have written. The legends about Hippocrates, whether completely imagined or evolved elaborations of reality, by their hero-generative nature, attest to the esteem bestowed on Hippocrates for nearly two and one-half millennia. [[6]](#cite_note-longrigg1998-6) In the modern age of Western medicine \u2014 beginning perhaps with the corrective emendations of the dogma of Hippocrates' self-proclaimed scientific heir, ce, respectively \u2014 the writings of the Hippocratic physicians no longer serve as 'chapter and verse' for the practice of medicine. Yet, as articulated by [Professor Sir Geoffrey Ernest Richard Lloyd](/wiki/index.php?title=Sir_Geoffrey_Lloyd&action=edit&redlink=1), former Professor of Ancient Philosophy and Science in the University of Cambridge, [[7]](#cite_note-7) ....Hippocrates still represents an ethical ideal, the ideal of the compassionate, discreet and selfless doctor.... [[8]](#cite_note-lloyd1983-8) Accordingly, graduating medical students in many Western medical schools continue to swear some form of the [Hippocratic Oath](/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath) that represents the ethical ideals articulated by Professor Lloyd. Sources for the life of Hippocrates | | Socrates, in speaking to a man by chance named Hippocrates wonders why the man exhibits excitement over the impending visit of a famous Sophist, Protagoras. In the dialogue, he reveals the existence of the physician, Hippocrates of Cos, the Asclepiad, implying that the latter's fame as a physician and teacher had reached Athens during his lifetime: Though Hippocrates looms large in the [imagination](/wiki/index.php?title=Imagination&action=edit&redlink=1) and in [historical](/wiki/History) tradition, unambiguous evidence for a satisfactorily full account of his life remains elusive. The evidence closest in time to Hippocrates' life comes to us from the writings of the philosopher [Plato](/wiki/Plato) (429-347 bce), a contemporary of Hippocrates. Plato has [Socrates](/wiki/Socrates) mentioning Hippocrates in his works, [Protagoras](/wiki/Protagoras) and [Phaedrus](/wiki/Phaedrus). These passages help us to locate Hippocrates in the context of Greek culture in the 5th century bce. The latter reference (which has inspired a large body of scholarship) comments on Hippocrates' methodology. Together, Plato's works give us reliable evidence of the existence of Hippocrates as a physician and teacher, as a citizen of Cos, of the Asclepiad family, who had achieved fame beyond his homeland during his lifetime. | | Socrates, in dialogue with Phaedrus, confirms the existence of Hippocrates the Asclepiad, indicating Hippocrates' holistic approach to medicine, and implying that Hippocrates' thought relating to medicine influenced philosophical thinking about such things as the nature of the soul: A passage in the Politics of [Aristotle](/wiki/Aristotle), a near contemporary of Hippocrates, also attests to Hippocrates' existence in a way that suggests his fame as a scientist physician. Hippocrates' life and work are discussed in the writings of [Aulus Cornelius Celsus](/wiki/index.php?title=Aulus_Cornelius_Celsus&action=edit&redlink=1) (d. ca. 50 ce). An anonymous, mystifying [papyrus](/wiki/index.php?title=Papyrus&action=edit&redlink=1) tries to differentiate the real teachings of Hippocrates from those merely attributed to him. Furthermore, it was recognized in antiquity that the Hippocratean corpus, the collection of writings attributed to Hippocrates, could not be the writings of one man. Later commentators, including the influential [Galen](/wiki/Galen), attempted to separate the genuine Hippocratean teachings from the spurious and included biographical detail when they did so. One Life of Hippocrates, a short work attributed to [Soranus of Ephesus](/wiki/Soranus_of_Ephesus) (a 2nd century ce physician), provides many details concerning Hippocrates' life. French Classics Professor, Jacques Jouanna, who has written a major work on Hippocrates and the Hippocratic Era, refers to it as \"the canonical source\", as it appears introductory to the earliest compiled editions of the Hippocratic corpus. [[11]](#cite_note-jouanna1999-11) Jouanna asserts that it \"draws upon more ancient sources, the most outstanding of which is the director of the library of Alexandria during the Hellenistic era, Eratosthenes of Cyrene. Given the lack of unambiguous contemporary evidence, many modern scholars have concluded that the real, historical Hippocrates is unknowable. In recent years, the research of Jacques Jouanna has re-opened the debate on the life of Hippocrates, and on many points of Hippocratean scholarship. [[11]](#cite_note-jouanna1999-11) [[12]](#cite_note-12) Hippocrates' life on the island of Cos Hippocrates entered the world into an aristocratic family on the Ionian island of Cos (or Kos), located in the Aegean Sea off the southwest coast of then called Ionia (Asia Minor, present day Turkey). [[13]](#cite_note-13) Hippocrates' father, Heraclides, and his father's father, also called Hippocrates, practiced medicine employing ancient ideas of supernatural causation and treatment of disease according to the tradition linked to Asclepius, considered a deity. [[14]](#cite_note-osler1913a-14) In fact, Heraclides traced his ancestry through the male line back to Asclepius in the era of the Trojan war, when Asclepius, a physician, had not yet received divine status. Heraclides descended through the male from Asclepius's son, Podalirius, who fought in the Trojan war, moved to Asia Minor, and whose descendants eventually settled on Cos. The tradition of Asclepian medicine passed from son to son down the generations, eventually reaching Heraclides. The family from Podalirius onward called themselves Asclepiads, their family name. Hippocrates belonged to the Coan branch of the family, settling on Cos; a second branch, splitting off from from Podalirius, settled on the nearby peninsula of Cnidus, referred to as the Cnidian branch, also continued to practice medicine. At the time of Hippocrates' birth, Cos paid tribute to Athens as a member of the Athenian federation created to defend against Persian aggression. Hippocrates, though known also as 'Hippocrates of Cos, the Asclepiad', and though reared in the family tradition of Asclepian medicine, rejected the supernatural ethos, substituting a naturalistic ethos, thereby sparking a revolution of principles and practice in medicine that present day non-supernatural Western scientific medicine acknowledges as its parentage and heritage. [[15]](#cite_note-longrigg1993-15) Scholars have found no evidence of Hippocrates ever practicing as a physician priest of Asclepius. Hippocrates' education within the family probably included, in addition to medicine, philosophy and rhetoric and other subjects that gave him knowledge of the world of reality. He remained on Cos well into maturity, married and had two sons and a daughter. His new practice of medicine according to the tenets of observation and reason gained him fame in and beyond Cos. One plausible story has him rejecting an invitation to court of the current king of Persia. [[16]](#cite_note-16) The emergence of Hippocratic medicine | | The Greeks invented rational medicine. Hippocratic medicine reflected the emerging philosophy that things and events in the world resulted from natural causes, a philosophy that began with the Ionian philosopher, [Thales of Miletus](/wiki/index.php?title=Thales_of_Miletus&action=edit&redlink=1) (c. 625-546), whose speculation about the natural world philosophers regard as an important turning point in Western scientific thought. Classicist and historian of medicine, James Longrigg elaborates that point in the accompanying sidebox to the right. The Hippocratic treatise, On Ancient Medicine, asserts that the practice of medicine does not derive from a priori first principles, as does the practice of some branches of philosophy, but from the findings in individual cases. Medicine does not qualify as philosophy, but as an observational science challenged by specific diseases arising from specific natural causes, the challenges met only by detailed observation leading to cumulative knowledge undergirded by rational reasoning. | | | | | | Hippocrates' life overlapped that of the great Greek natural philosophers Empedocles (ca. 495-435 bce), Socrates (469-399 bce), Plato (429-347 bce) and Aristotle (384-322 bce). Thus he lived during the Golden Age of Greece (c. 500 - 300 bce). Disease, so central a continuing problem in human lives, not surprisingly would come under scientific scrutiny in the environment of such thinkers. Historians know that Hippocrates observed keenly (\"infinite in faculty\"), reasoned rationally (\"noble in reason\"), and taught and practiced a holistic ideal of medicine (\"what a piece of work is Man\") [[19]](#cite_note-19) [[20]](#cite_note-ventegodt-20) that regarded health and disease as manifestations of body and mind as a whole \u2014 though centuries later Margagni would offer a qualification. An excerpt from one of the Hippocratic Treatises, Places in Man, aptly illustrates the Hippocratic holistic view. [[18]](#cite_note-craik1998-18) See sidebox at lower right. | | \"Why do modern day researchers keep going back to Hippocrates?....although ancient, some notions expressed in the Hippocratic works are still applicable today. What is more important though, is a reason easily recognized to anyone familiar with Hippocratic descriptions of infection: the clarity of presentation of the clinical course and the astute inclusion of infection in a broader environmental and social context are still unparalleled by modern thinking.\" \u2014Georgios Pappasa, Ismene J. Kiriazea, and Matthew E. Falagas Hippocrates founded a school of medicine known by his name, and advocated a basic approach to the diagnosis and treatment of disease that still has applications in modern medicine. [For example, see Pappas et al. [[21]](#cite_note-pappas2008-21), Chang et al. [[22]](#cite_note-chang2007-22), and Ghaemi [[23]](#cite_note-ghaemi2008a-23)] History gave his name to an oath of medical ethics called the [Hippocratic Oath](/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath). \"The code of conduct for doctors outlined in the Hippocratic Oath, a vow commonly taken by modern doctors\", remains an ethical guideline in medicine. [[24]](#cite_note-24) One can begin to appreciate the influence of Hippocrates to the present day by his presence in the World Wide Web since the year 2000, where the scientific search engine, SCIRUS, reveals 74,523 entries, and Google search reveals ~172,000 entries for the twelve months preceding April 2008. Early Greek medicine operated as a supernatural, magical art. The god of healing, Asclepius (Aesculapius in Roman terminology), [[25]](#cite_note-25) whose priests and temples flourished in ancient Greece at least from the Homeric era, appeared in the dreams of the sick who came to the temple for 'sleep therapy'. Asclepius gave advice to the dreamer, which the priests interpreted. The priests prescribed baths, diets, exercises, changes in occupation or living locales, and other routines, and those prescriptions received credit when cures occurred. The cult of 'therapeutic dreaming' persisted in various places even into Christian times. [[26]](#cite_note-osler1913b-26) Hippocratic medicine developed as the \"naturalistic counterpart\" of the Asclepian supernaturalistic tradition. [[27]](#cite_note-prioreschi-27) By the 6th century bce (the 500s bce) Greek philosophers emerged and began to theorize about the natural causes of the way the world worked. Empedocles (ca. 495-435 bce), characterized as a physician and philosopher, postulated earth, air, fire and water as the primordial elements of which everything in the world consisted, in differing combinations and kinds of combinations, including the human body. [[28]](#cite_note-28) [[29]](#cite_note-29) - \"The development of Hippocratic medicine, its [Aesculapian medicine's] naturalistic counterpart, is considered a turning point in the history of the healing arts although, as we have seen, at about the same time, naturalistic medical paradigms were developing in other ancient civilizations as well. The importance of Hippocratic medicine rests on the fact that it is the first comprehensive naturalistic medical system of the Western world and therefore the source from which scientific medicine would eventually originate.\" \u2014Plinio Prioreschi [[27]](#cite_note-prioreschi-27) Indeed, the development of Hippocratic medicine may have influenced changes in the persisting Asclepian practice. [[30]](#cite_note-30) For its objectives of seeking classification, causes and remedies of disease, medicine requires reason, but not only reason. Considering that knowledge emerges from information processed by reason, not only does the quality of reason count, but also does the quality of the information fed into reason count. Reason will yield a formally valid conclusion, but if fed flawed information, it will not yield a reliable conclusion. For the latter, reason requires information ultimately based on empirically sound observation. If based on wishful thinking, imagination, unquestioned assumptions, believed revelations by deities, guesswork and the like, reason yields at best dubious knowledge and at worst false knowledge. Hippocrates appears to have understood that, and as a physician considered to epitomize the art of medicine, as Socrates did, he inspired many likeminded and knowledge-seeking followers. In her blog, \"Well: Tara Health\", Parker asks, What Would Hippocrates Do?, [[31]](#cite_note-parker2008-31) and in the process of reviewing physician Daniel H. Newman's book, Hippocrates' Shadow: Secrets from the House of Medicine, [[32]](#cite_note-newmanmd2008-32) gives us an excerpt from Newman's book that elaborates revealingly on the methods of the Hippocratic physicians: | | By today's standards, Hippocrates was a profoundly abnormal physician. Medicine's founding father routinely tasted his patients' urine, sampled their pus and earwax, and smelled and scrutinized their stool. He assessed the stickiness of their sweat and examined their blood, their phlegm, their tears, and their vomit. He became closely ac\u00acquainted with their general disposition, family, and home, and he studied their facial expressions....In deciding upon a final diagnosis and treatment, Hippocrates recorded and considered dietary habits, the season, the local prevailing winds, the water supply at the patient's residence, and the direction the home faced. He absorbed everything, examining exhaustively and documenting meticulously. Likely inspired by Empedocles' concept of four elements making up natural things, [[33]](#cite_note-longrigg1993a-33) the concept of four humours (blood, yellow bile, black bile, phlegm) as constituent elements of the human body emerged as part of the Hippocratic tradition, the individual humours in various combinations determining state of health and personality: - excess blood makes a person 'sanguine', full of energy, optimistic, ruddy complected - excess yellow bile makes a person 'bilious', 'choleric', bad tempered, quick to anger, irritable - excess black bile makes a person 'melancholic', deeply and long-lastingly sad - excess phlegm makes a person 'phlegmatic', unemotional, temperamentally slow, calm Historians have not identified an individual who originated the four humours theory, nor have they excluded the possibility that the theory emerged into a formal theory only gradually. [[34]](#cite_note-lonie1981-34) | | The medical corollary of Empedocles' theory is the identification of the traditional humours with constituent elements: what made this possible was the presence, in the traditional view of humours, of positive characteristics. Because of these characteristics it was easy to conceive the humours as the ingredients of man, upon which his normal or healthy state, as well as his very existence, depended....It is not the recognition of this or that humour as existing which counts, but the theoretical use to which that humour is put. One would therefore also have to find evidence....that the humours were regarded as constituent parts of the human body. There seems no a priori reason why this should not have been the case, in any writer working after say 450. But in the absence of such evidence, the question of the precise originator of the four-humoral theory is formally insoluble....What is perhaps of more interest is the way in which the theory of four humours exemplifies the stimulating effects of Greek philosophy on Greek medical science. It may be described in this way: the philosopher provides the categories within which the medical scientist can order his experience. (Page 61.) The Hippocratic physician: scientist or craftsman? H.J.F. Horstmanshoff argues that the Hippocratic physicians qualify as craftsmen, and not as scientists: Ancient physicians did not receive scholarly, scientific training. The intellectual attitudes and social status which we are inclined to attribute to them are anachronisms nourished by the Hippocratic tradition from Galen to Littr\u00e9. Physicians who had scholarly ambitions steered toward philosophy and rhetoric rather than to empirical disciplines. As a consequence of the prevailing social and economic outlook, the image of the rhetor [teacher of rhetoric, or orator] and of the philosopher were considered to be far better than that of the engineer or of the artisan, or that of those devoted to applied knowledge in general. Ancient physicians were above all craftsmen. Nevertheless the more ambitious among them cloaked over the manual aspects of their art and explained away the remuneration for their services with the help of rhetoric [persuasive public speaking]. [[35]] .... The Hippocratic physicians and women patients In his study of the Hippocratic treatises, ancient Greek theatrical productions, the works of [Plato](/wiki/Plato), and the comments of [Herodotus](/wiki/Herodotus), Jacques Jouanna discusses the practice of the Hippocratic physicians in respect of women. He makes the following points: [[36]](#cite_note-jouannawomen-36) - Hippocratic physicians treated women as well as men. - Commonly the physician treated women who had [genital tract disorders](/wiki/index.php?title=Gynecology&action=edit&redlink=1). - Although the Hippocratic physicians did not dismiss the importance of the [gynecological](/wiki/index.php?title=Gynecology&action=edit&redlink=1)disorders, that did not automatically remove the barrier of women's modesty and their eagerness to request a physicians's help. - Hippocratic physicians did not approve of the women's reluctance to call on them, as that could have serious consequences for the women. - Nevertheless, physicians could not always be counted on to have the requisite [knowledge](/wiki/Knowledge)and experience of conditions specific to women. - Women could not call upon women physicians, because in Hippocrates's era no woman could assert herself a physician. - Women preferred to seek the help of other women for disorders specific to women \u2014 especially women who had similar disorders or who attended those with similar disorders. - Certain women could serve as [midwives](/wiki/index.php?title=Midwife&action=edit&redlink=1), \u2014 Socrates' mother, for example. - Though not physicians, midwives were referred to as 'healers' and 'she who treats', and were considered professionals. - Hippocratic physicians sometimes worked directly with midwives, and sometimes instructed them how to proceed, as in a difficult childbirth. - In general, the Hippocratic physicians tasked themselves to maintain complete respect for a woman's modesty and dignity. The Hippocratic physicians as novices in preventive medicine As Jouanna notes, none of the treatises of the Hippocratic collection of writings devotes itself exclusively to preventive medicine, suggesting lesser development of preventive than curative medicine among the Hippocratic physicians. [[11]](#cite_note-jouanna1999-11) Yet the Hippocratic physicians recognized that certain practices tended to preserve health, and wrote about them within the treatise collection. Jouanna notes that the Hippocratics prescribed evacuations (vomiting, bowel evacuations) as preventive: \"According to the author of Nature of Man, good hygiene required that vomiting be induced in winter and bowel evacuations in summer.\" [[11]](#cite_note-jouanna1999-11) The author explained the reason for the preventive regimen based on the effects of seasonality on the balance of humors in the body. The Nature of Man writes of other preventive measures based on diet, exercise and baths, and cautions to design preventive regimens in keeping with seasons and many other factors. A more elaborate description of such a regimen also appears in the treatise Regimen. The author of Regimen also stressed looking in healthy people for signs, not so much of a disease, but of indicators that the true symptoms of disease will soon appear. We do that today using blood tests like those of lipid types and concentrations as harbingers of heart disease and stroke. To protect oneself from the 'miasmas' [[37]](#cite_note-37) believed the cause of plagues, the rationalist Hippocratics advised reducing one's respiratory cavity, through weight loss, and getting out of town. Preventive medicine has advanced along with the advances in curative medicine, perhaps not as rapidly or successfully. Interested readers might consult some of the journals devoted to the subject and visit the website of the American College of Preventive Medicine: [Preventive Medicine](http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/622934/description#description) [American Journal of Preventive Medicine](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science//journal/07493797) Primary Prevention](http://springerlink.metapress.com/content/105378/?p=c061a979a64841baa471c3d0865aeb20&p_o=1) [American Society of Preventive Medicine](http://www.acpm.org/) Social and economic roles of the Hippocratic physicians The Hippocratic Corpus records a wealth of information about classical Greek medicine, yet records little details about the lives of the Hippocratic physicians. In part to remedy that gap, or compensate in a way for it, classical scholar, Hui-hua Chang studied the Greek cities in the northern regions of the Aegean where the Hippocratic physicians spent time, as recorded in the Hippocratic treatise, Epidemics. [[38]](#cite_note-chang2005-38) The express purpose of the study, according to Professor Chang, \"...is to determine how such places may help us define the social and economic roles of Greek physicians in the Classical period.\" Professor Chang's analysis reveals that the Hippocratic physicians were not mere aimless itinerants, as sometimes implied by writers. Rather, more objectively, Chang characterizes them as physicians visiting targeted towns and villages to seek employment and financial support as opportunity presented. They found more job opportunities in the larger urban centers where division of labor accompanied by specialization of occupation had evolved. Moreover, such centers housed wealthy individuals and families who could support the renown Hippocratic physicians of burgeoning repute. Professor Chang provides detailed descriptions of the cities visited by the Hippocratic physicians, their location on trade routes, their chiefs sources of trade, their resources for their daily lives \u2014 revealing most of them as wealthy commercial centers or the major cities in the region. He describes: - Cyzicus on the southern coast of Propontis (now the Sea of Marmara) \u2014 visible upper right on the accompanying map south of Thrace and North of Asia Minor (Anatolia) \u2014 acquiring its wealth from its location on the trade route between the Black Sea to the northeast and the Aegean Sea to the west, its exports of wine, fish and marble, and it supply of wheat to the Aegean from Russia. - Perinthis on the northern coast of Propontis, also depicted on the map, a trade city with abundant territory to produce corn, cattle and timber. - Abdera and Ainos, on the Thracian coast near the island of Thrasos in the north Thracian Sea. Ainos acquired its wealth from its location at the mouth of the major river in the northern Aegean, supplying the Aegean with the products fertile Thracian fields in return for Greek merchandise. Abdera \u2014 home of the geometer and atomist, Democritus, whom legend has it Hippocrates visited because of accusations of mental dysfunction and declared Democritus the sanest man in town \u2014 became \"the emporium of the silver trade\". - Thrasos, the island and its Thracian mainland colonies, wealthy from gold and silver mining and producing wine considered the finest in Greece. The Hippocratic physicians spent much time there. - Olynthus, the largest city on the peninsula of Chalcidice, visible on the map in the southern part of Macedonia, destroyed after Hippocrates' death because Phillip II considered it a threat to his rule of Macedonia. The Hippocratic physicians practiced their art there prior to its destruction, when its large population displayed their wealth and power. - Larissa, in Thessaly, south of Macedonia and left of center on the map, shows up in Epidemics with many descriptions of medical cases. It had much fertile land and control of the mountain passes to Macedonia. Possibly the Hippocratic favored those cities both because their wealth and the undoubted wealth of patients in cities with dense populations of people living luxuriously. Large populations also usually meant labor division and thus opportunities for physicians to concentrate on practicing medicine. Professor Chang closes thus: It was in such places as those described above, where wealth was concentrated and people with open minds resided, that they [the Hippocratic physicians] would find clients and patrons who were ready to accept untraditional [non-supernatural] ideas and who would support the art of the Hippocratic doctors. [[38]] Coan vs. Cnidian schools of medicine Many historians of medicine contrast schools of medicine of the Coan branch of Podilarius's family, to which Hippocrates of Cos belonged, and the Cnidian branch that settled nearby Cos, on a peninsula off Asia Minor. By 'schools of medicine' they refer to different philosophies and practices of the earliest rationalist Western medicine. Other historians have regarded the two schools \"....self-inflating and self-generating myths....\" [[39]](#cite_note-smithwd73-39) in part the result of misrepresentations by Galen and in part the result of misinterpretations of Galen by historians. [[39]](#cite_note-smithwd73-39) Yale medical historian and clinical professor of surgery, Sherwin B. Nuland, attributed distinguishing features to the two schools. [[40]](#cite_note-nulan88-40) .... The Hippocratic treatises Emile Littr\u00e9's translations of the writings of the Hippocratic physicians Writings attributed to Hippocrates, about sixty volumes in number, written in the Ionian dialect of Greek, have survived to the present, with accompanying translations in French, residing in a 19th century ten-volume work by the French scholar, \u00c9mile Littr\u00e9, completed in 1862. [[11]](#cite_note-jouanna1999-11) Littr\u00e9 ((Maximilien-)Paul-\u00c9mile Littr\u00e9) received education in medicine (but received no degree), and in numerous languages, including Greek, Latin, German, English and Sanskrit. He gained repute for his lexicographic work, a scholarly dictionary of the French language, considered \"....one of the outstanding lexicographic accomplishments of all time.\" [[41]](#cite_note-41) Jouanna states that \".... Despite the progress made by Hippocratic [philology](/wiki/index.php?title=Philology&action=edit&redlink=1) over the last one hundred years, the Littr\u00e9 edition [of the Hippocratic writings] has not yet been entirely superseded. \" [[11]](#cite_note-jouanna1999-11) One can read Littr\u00e9's French translations of the Hippocratic writings at the website of the [Bibliotheque interuniversitaire de medecine (Paris).](http://www.bium.univ-paris5.fr/histmed/medica/hipp_vf.htm) The links to each of the 10 volumes are given here: [[42]](#cite_note-42) Listing of Hippocratic treatises This Appendix 3. [[11]](#cite_note-jouanna1999-11) Jouanna states: \"The principal editions given are based Greek-French edition of \u00c9mile Littr\u00e9 (10 vols., 1839-1861). [[11]](#cite_note-jouanna1999-11) The Editors have inserted brief excerpts from some of the treatises, to give the reader some flavor of the works. - Address from the Altar (=Epibomios) - Affections - Airs, Waters, Places | | Especially one treatise among the Hippocratic writings has attracted attention as a celebrated example of geographical or meteorological medicine (Nutton 2005, 75). An unknown Greek physician wrote in the second half of the fifth century BC (Jouanna 1999, 375) the famous treatise called Airs, Waters, Places, which starts by describing what circumstances an itinerant physician must consider when he comes to an unfamiliar town. The treatise contains several passages about the health effects of water, and the ancient Greek author deals with the different sources, qualities and health effects of water in length. Translations of ancient texts are from the Loeb Classical Library editions, as listed in the references. | | \"He (the itinerant doctor) must also consider the properties of waters; for as these differ in taste and in weight, so the property of each is far different from that of any other. [...] He must consider with the greatest care both these things and how the natives are off for water, whether they use marshy, soft waters, or such as are hard and come from rocky heights, or brackish and harsh. [...]\" (Airs, Waters, Places. 1) | | Ideas expressed in the Airs, Waters, Places had a definite influence during antiquity and later. The philosopher Plato (428/427-348/347 BC) most probably knew the legendary Hippocrates and was familiar with Hippocratic medicine and the ideas of environmental influences on health. He advised a lawmaker who was about to found a city to take into account several factors, among them water: \"Some sites are suitable or unsuitable because of varying winds or periods of heat, others because of the quality of the water.\" (Plato Laws. 5.747d) The ideas on climate, place and water expressed in Airs, Waters, Places are seen in the manual of architecture De Architectura by Vitruvius in the late first century BC. \"[...] he must know the art of medicine in its relation to the regions of the earth (which the Greeks call climata); and to the characters of the atmosphere, of localities (wholesome or pestilential), of water-supply.

Aphorisms The first aphorism | | \"....the First Aphorism is medicine's whole law; the rest is commentary.\" Of the more than 400 aphorisms attributed to Hippocrates, the first has received the most attention. In the Francis Adams translation, [[48]](#cite_note-adams1886-48) it reads: Life is short, and the Art long; the occasion fleeting; experience fallacious; and judgment difficult. The physician must not only be prepared to do what is right himself, but also to make the patient, the attendants, and the externals cooperate. [[48]] Another 19th century translation: [[49]](#cite_note-charlesadams1868-49) Life is short, and Art long; the crisis fleeting; experience perilous, and decision difficult. The physician must not only be prepared to do what is right himself, but also to make the patient, the attendants, and externals cooperate. [[49]] The same aphorism as translated in the Hippocratic Writings edited by G. E. R. Lloyd reads: [[8]](#cite_note-lloyd1983-8) Life is short, science is long; opportunity is elusive, experiment is dangerous, judgement is difficult. It is not enough for the physician to do what is necessary, but the patient and the attendants must do their part as well, and circumstances must be favourable. [[8]] In the Adams translation, the \"Art\", always with an capital 'A', refers to medicine \u2014 the art of medicine. In the Lloyd text, the 'Art of medicine' becomes 'science'. In either case, the first clause of the first aphorism seems to say that the lifespan of a physician does not suffice for learning the Art of medicine, all of its science. The implication would seem to exhort awareness to physicians that they cannot expect learn all of medicine in a lifetime, an exhortation to humility and avoidance of overconfidence. Can any physician even two and a half millennia later deny the aphorism, especially in respect of the enormous amount and intricate complexity of the knowledge base of medicine in the early 21st century. Perhaps the complete Art of medicine will always overwhelm any one physician's lifetime of learning and practice. Sherwin Nuland puts it this way: Although life expectancy is currently well more than twice what it was during the golden age of Greece, it will never be endowed with years enough for anyone to master the vast expanse of medical knowledge, or even that part of it sufficient for an individual doctor to care for all of his patients. [[47]] The aphorism continues with the occasion fleeting, alternatively opportunity is elusive, generally interpreted as indicating the need for timely diagnosis to achieve the best results of treatment \u2014 a narrow window of opportunity. [E]xperience fallacious, or experiment [in the sense of experience] is dangerous, seems to warn of misinterpreting the patient's symptoms and signs by relying on experience that might apply generally but not to the specific patient at hand owing to that patient's particular circumstances, internal or external, physiological or psychological. Sherwin Nuland applies that to the non-personal 'experience' that statistics offers, unless it takes into consideration individual variability and the factors that go into generating it. [J]udgment is difficult seems to follow given that life is short and the art long, and that experience of other cases cannot always be counted as reliable when applied to an individual patient at hand. 21st century scholarly interest in and diversity of views of Hippocrates - Some Abstracts paragraphed or otherwise reformatted for ease of reading - Astyrakaki E, Papaioannou A, Askitopoulou H. [[50]](#cite_note-50) | | The Hippocratic Collection, containing 60 medical texts by Hippocrates and his pupils, was searched using the electronic database Thesaurus Lingua Graeca to identify the words \"anaesthesia\" and \"analgesia,\" their derivatives and also words related to pain. Our purpose was to investigate the special use and meaning of these words and their significance in medical terms. The word \"anaesthesia\" appears 12 times in five Hippocratic texts to describe loss of sensation by a disease process. This observation reveals Hippocrates as the first Greek writer to use the word in a medical rather than a philosophical context. Hippocrates was also the first Greek physician to keep an airway open by bypassing a pharyngeal obstruction with the insertion of narrow tubes into the swollen throat of a patient with quinsy, thus facilitating the airflow into the lungs. In the Hippocratic texts, \"analgesia\" is related to \"anaesthesia\" for the first time, when it is pointed out that an unconscious patient is insensitive to pain. Hippocrates and his followers rationalized pain as a clinical variable and as a valuable diagnostic and prognostic tool. They used expressive and precise adjectives and well-defined characteristics of pain, such as location, duration, or relation to other symptoms, to elucidate a disease process. They also had a wide terminology for the various types of pain, still in use today. Many cures were described for the treatment of pain, including incisions, effusions, venesection, purges, cauterization and, most interestingly, the use of many plants, such as opium or the application of soporific substances. In particular, Hippocrates refers to opium poppy as \"sleep inducing.\" - Grammaticos PC, Diamantis A.

He described in a scientific manner, many diseases and their treatment after detailed observation. He lived about 2400 years ago. He was born in the island of Kos and died at the outskirts of Larissa at the age of 104. Hippocrates taught and wrote under the shade of a big plane tree, its descendant now is believed to be 500 years old, the oldest tree in Europe-platanus orientalis Hippocraticus- with a diameter of 15 meters. Hippocrates saved Athens from a plague epidemic and for that was highly honored by the Athenians. He considered Democritus-the father of the atomic theory- to be his teacher and after visiting him as a physician to look after his health, he accepted no money for this visit. ome of his important aphorisms were: \"As to diseases, make a habit of two things -to help or at least to do no harm\". Also: \"Those by nature over weight, die earlier than the slim.\", also, \"In the wounds there are miasmata causing disease if entered the body\".He used as a pain relief, the abstract from a tree containing what he called \"salycasia\", like aspirin. He described for the first time epilepsy not as a sacred disease, as was considered at those times, but as a hereditary disease of the brain and added: \"Do not cut the temporal place, because spasms shall occur on the opposite area\". According to Hippocrates, people on those times had either one or two meals (lunch and dinner). He also suggested: \"...little exercise...and walk...do not eat to saturation\". Also he declared: \"Physician must convert or insert wisdom to medicine and medicine to wisdom\".

[[54]](#cite_note-54) | | Rev Med Brux. of pneumology in antiquity (part French] Demaeyer P. Abstract Nowadays, Hippocrate, \"The Father of Medicine\", still influences our medicine. He was famous because of the great medical corpus texts preserved in his name. Only recently, our universities have updated the famous Hippocratic Oath to avoid contradictions with our modern ethics. Hippocrate was a great clinician but a poor anatomist. Hippocratical humourism remained accurate until the age of the enlightenment (18th century). Furthermore, it is difficult to distinguish medicine from philosophy in Greek antiquity. So we have to contextualize Greek ancient medicine in this philosophical field. In the 3rd century before Christus (BC), the centre of gravity in medicine shifted to Alexandria. Indeed, a famous academic library was created in 288 BC. At the same time, dissection of human cadavers was authorized until the first century BC. This enabled the evolution of the knowledge in anatomy and physiology. Rome was still polytheistic population until the end of ancient times. Rome integrated Greek gods in his pantheon. Asclepios became Aesculapius. Rome despises physicians in the first ancient age of Rome. The family's father provided medical cares. A lot of Greek physicians settled then in Rome. Again, roman medicine grew in parallel with philosophical trends. These trends were called \"sects\" but in fact, they were rather medical schools. In this review, we will especially talk about three physicians of this period: Aurelius Cornelius Celsus, Ar\u00e9t\u00e9e of Cappadocia and Galenus of Pergamon. Thereafter, medical knowledge did not really change significantly until Renaissance period. PMID: 27487699 [PubMed - in process] References and notes cited in text - Links in blue font-color.

His collected works include various references to infectious diseases that range from general observations on the nature of infection, hygiene, epidemiology, and the immune response, to detailed descriptions of syndromes such as tuberculous spondylitis, malaria, and tetanus. We sought to evaluate the extent to which this historical information has influenced the modern relevant literature. Associating disease to the disequilibrium of body fluids may seem an ancient and outdated notion nowadays, but many of the clinical descriptions presented in the Corpus Hippocraticum (Hippocratic Collection) are still the archetypes of the natural history of certain infectious diseases and their collective interplay with the environment, climate, and society. For this reason, modern clinicians and researchers continue to be attracted to these 'lessons' from the past - lessons that remain extremely valuable.

[PMID 18441665](//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18441665?dopt=Abstract) - OBJECTIVE: To provide a conceptual basis for psychopharmacology. METHOD: This review compares contemporary psychopharmacology practice with the Hippocratic tradition of medicine by examining the original Hippocratic corpus and modern interpretations (by William Osler and Oliver Wendell Holmes). RESULTS: The Hippocratic philosophy is that only some, not all, diseases should be treated and, even then, treatments should enhance the natural healing process, not serve as artificial cures. Hippocratic ethics follow from this philosophy of disease and treatment. Two rules for Hippocratic medicine are derived from the teachings of Osler (treat diseases, not symptoms) and Holmes (medications are guilty until proven innocent). The concept of a diagnostic hierarchy is also stated explicitly: Not all diseases are created equal. This idea helps to avoid mistaking symptoms for diseases and to avoid excessive diagnosis of comorbidities. Current psychopharmacology is aggressive and non-Hippocratic: symptom-based, rather than disease oriented; underemphasizing drug risks; and prone to turning symptoms into diagnoses. These views are applied to bipolar disorder. CONCLUSIONS: Contemporary psychopharmacology is non-Hippocratic. A proposal for moving in the direction of a Hippocratic psychopharmacology is provided.

In the religion of Babylonia, an important part was played by the mystery of sleep, and the interpretation of dreams; and no doubt from the East the Greeks took over the practice of divination in sleep, for in the AEsculapian cult also, the incubation sleep played a most important role. That it continued in later times is well indicated in the orations of Aristides, the arch-neurasthenic of ancient history, who was a great dreamer of dreams.... There are still in parts of Greece and in Asia Minor shrines at which incubation is practiced regularly, and if one may judge from the reports, with as great success as in Epidaurus. At one place in Britain, Christchurch in Monmouthshire, incubation was carried on till the early part of the nineteenth century.

Dr. Newman sees a disconnect between doctor and patient, a disregard for the healing power of the bond, and, ultimately, a disconnect between doctors and their Oath....The root of this divergence, writes Dr. Newman, lies in the patterns of secrecy and habit that characterize the \"House of Medicine,\" modern medicine's entrenched and carefully protected subculture. In reflexive, often unconscious defense of this subculture, doctors and patients guard medical authority, cling to tradition, and yield to demands that they do something or prescribe something. The result is a biomedical culture that routinely engages in unnecessary and inefficient practices, and leaves both patient and doctor dissatisfied. While demonstrating an abiding respect for, and a deep understanding of, the import of modern science, Dr. Newman reviews research that refutes common and accepted medical wisdom. He cites studies that show how mammograms may cause more harm than good; why antibiotics for sore throats are virtually always unnecessary and therefore dangerous; how cough syrup is rarely more effective than a sugar pill; the power and paradox of the placebo effect; how statistics and studies themselves are frequently deceptive; and why CPR is violent, invasive -- and almost always futile....Through an engaging, deeply researched, and eloquent narrative laced with rich and riveting case studies, Newman cuts to the heart of what really works -- and doesn't -- in medicine and rebuilds the bridge between physicians and their patients. - Publisher's Excerpt: See: [http://www.simonsays.com/content/book.cfm?tab=1&pid=625462&agid=2](http://www.simonsays.com/content/book.cfm?tab=1&pid=625462&agid=2) [](#cite_ref-longrigg1993a_33-0)Longrigg J.

[footnote here] - Once this digestive process had been completed, the nutriment was then carried to the liver, where it was turned into blood, [footnote here] itself a compound of all the elements in (more or less) equal proportions (In phys. 32-3 D.K.31B98) and thence distributed through the blood vessels (Soranus, Gynaec. I 57, 42. 12 Ilb. D.K.31A79) and assimilated by the body by a process of 'like to like' (A\u00ebtius, V 27, 1 D.K.31A77). - Empedocles apparently considered flesh to be a thickening and secondary formation of the blood since both are composed essentially according to the same formula (cf. B98 last line and A\u00ebtius, V 22, 1 D.K.31A78)\u2014although, presumably, blood would contain a somewhat larger proportion of water than flesh.

Of the roughly 70 medical treatises collected under his name--the Hippocratic Collection--many are not by him; even the famous Hippocratic Oath (in Volume I of the Loeb edition) may not be his. But he was undeniably the \"Father of Medicine.\" And the treatises in the Hippocratic Collection are essential sources of information about the practice of medicine in antiquity and about Greek theories concerning the human body.
