Phytotherapy and medicinal plants in your organic pharmacy Herbal medicine is an alternative medicine that uses the active ingredients contained in medicinal plants. Herbal medicine uses the virtues of plants to treat all kinds of ailments. To be fully effective, this approach must be based on quality products. It is therefore essential to choose the right herbal remedies to take full advantage of the properties of plants. Medicinal plants used in herbal medicine are consumed in different forms, fresh or dried (eg: infusion, decoction), or in the form of standardized fresh plants (EPS) in capsules, in fluid extract. The efficacy of plants and their therapeutic indications differ according to their form of use. Our pharmacy specializing in organic herbal medicine online has Ars approval for magistral preparations and offers you its selection of [phytoprevent EPS mixtures](/en/32-eps-phytoprevent-eps-en-melange-phytostandard) . Phytostandards by Phytopr\u00e9vent are fluid extracts from plants. The plant extracts are obtained according to a patented process which preserves the integrity of the plant and all the active ingredients it contains. These extracts are standardized to guarantee a constant and stable concentration of active ingredients . How to treat yourself effectively with herbal medicine and medicinal plants Herbal medicine comes from the Greek and means \"to cure by plants\". It is partly based on a traditional practice, based on the ancestral and local use of plants. Medicinal plants contain many active ingredients (more than 250) which have complementary or synergistic therapeutic activities. These assets have been studied and reproduced chemically to be incorporated nowadays in many drugs. There are many phytotherapy products on the market and in different galenics: tablets, capsules (solid forms), fluids in the form of ampoules or in a vial, etc. making the choice difficult. At care-et-nature.com, we favor the quality of the plant used : fresh plant, dry plant, from organic farming or not, which conditions its content and richness in active ingredients. A plant-based product must, in order to be optimally effective, restore all the molecular complexity of the plant which is at the origin of its therapeutic activity . Particular attention must therefore be paid to the process used for the extraction of the compounds. All our phytotherapy and herbalism products are of high quality, certified and validated by strict pharmaceutical control , from the producer to the customer. Precautions for use with herbal medicine Many people imagine that taking herbal medicines is harmless and safe. Some plants contain very active components which can be extremely potent and others are poisonous in low doses. Using plants does not mean it is safe . Certain substances added to active products to stabilize or preserve them can cause dangerous side effects. The active principles of plants are concentrated in one or more part (s) of these: roots, leaves, flowers. Given their action on the body and their potentially undesirable effects, medicinal plants should be consumed as prescribed by a healthcare professional : the therapeutic indications, the form of administration, the dosage, the frequency and the duration of use of a medicinal plant.

Plants contain active ingredients that are effective in relieving many different ailments. Phytotherapy is a gentle but effective medicine but its use must be supervised by the advice of a pharmacist. Like any therapeutic practice, even gentle, it can induce interactions with drugs. Its use must be careful and the advice of a doctor or pharmacist may be sought. Particular vigilance is brought to the use of essential oils in aromatherapy. Aromatherapy induces precautions for use that should be known. An essential oil, even organic, must therefore be considered as a pharmaceutical specialty in its own right. The use of plants should not, however, interfere with the taking of a treatment taken daily.
