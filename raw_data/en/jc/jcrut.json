Had my heart MRI in London this week after my heart being what seems to be the last remaining symptom and one that has effected me the most after palpitations, chest pains, thumping heart beats, Rhythm issues and so on. And the MRI showed up absolutely nothing. Showed my heart was absolutely perfect. All heart valves and chambers working as they should. No past inflammation. Which is an absolute relief but also leaves you scratching your head even more as to what is happening. Doctor is now moving towards POTS and says it can take up-to 18 months to go away. Had MRI's on both my head and heart in the last 5 months and both perfect. So now it's just time to wait it out and be patient Fresh walnuts and Hawthorne berry tincture, results in 1-2 weeks....palps almost un-noticeable. [@nresearcher](https://vestibular.org/participant/nresearcher/) I've been thinking a lot about this, and I think you're right: Plasmapheresis may be a plausible solution. If there were some way to remove the antibodies from our system, I'm positive we'd find relief! Did you have relapses before it went away? Yes, I had several relapses. The most serious one came after a night of drinking alcohol resulting in an intense postional vertigo attack that set me back a few weeks. Relapses are a common complaint on this forum.

[jacquelyn sauriol](https://vestibular.org/participant/jacquelynsauriol/) Hi everyone! I'm so relieved to find this forum and see that I'm not the only one having a complete nightmare after getting the Pfizer vaccine. My symptoms started to appear around 10 weeks post vaccination - I have pretty much all the symptoms mentioned over here including heart palpitations, pain and numbness in legs and arms, horrible insomnia and difficulty staying asleep for more than 1h. I've never felt more lonely, tired and discouraged in my life, I've been to several doctors and even ended up at the ER and all I've been told is that I'm completely fine and need to relax a bit as it's probably all psychological. It's been 3 weeks since I started having the symptoms and it's not getting any better. Hope we will all get past this soon!!

How long did it take? Did you have head pressure and dizziness (or boat feeling)? Are your symptoms gone now? How long did it take? Did you have head pressure and dizziness (or boat feeling)? My positional vertigo, dizziness brain fog and balance problems are completely gone for about 6 weeks now. I never had head pressure. My problems were vestibular (inner ear). Tinnitus and fatigue still linger but the worst is over. [@nresearcher]I've been thinking a lot about this, and I think you're right: Plasmapheresis may be a plausible solution. If there were some way to remove the antibodies from our system, I'm positive we'd find relief! Wonder if [@gatordoc](https://vestibular.org/participant/gatordoc/) who posted some very helpful posts might have an opinion... It would be nice to be able to have measurements of different types of antibodies and different inflammatory cytokines (such as TNF- and IL-6). In the meantime, it seems lowering inflammation as much as possible through lifestyle (anti-inflammatory diet, reducing stress, etc.) may be helpful. Here i am again guys, just wanted yo update my personal experience and share it here. I had many of the symptoms described here, but after 5 months from the second dose (14th august), almost everything is gone. The only 2 symptoms that persists are fatigue and eyestrain, i'm always tired and when i do anything my eyes sometimes lose focus, i feel like i have a weight between them. I am taking alpha-lipoic acid as an integrator and it's working really well (Tiobec 600mg), it was suggested by my doc. Also, sometimes at random my heart rate spikes and remains between 90 and 110 bpm for about 15 mins to 1-2 hours, then back to normal (70).
