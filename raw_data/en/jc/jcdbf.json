Revised: 7/2022 FULL PRESCRIBING INFORMATION: CONTENTS XYNTHA, Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), is indicated for use in adults and children with hemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency) for: XYNTHA does not contain von Willebrand factor, and therefore is not indicated in patients with von Willebrand's disease. For intravenous use after reconstitution only. The expected in vivo peak increase in factor VIII level expressed as IU/dL (or % of normal) can be estimated using the following formulas: Dosage (International Units) = body weight (kg) \u00d7 desired factor VIII rise (IU/dL or % of normal) \u00d7 0.5 (IU/kg per IU/dL) or IU/dL (or % of normal) = Total Dose (IU)/body weight (kg) \u00d7 2 [IU/dL]/[IU/kg] On-demand treatment and Control of Bleeding Episodes A guide for dosing XYNTHA for on-demand treatment and control of bleeding episodes is provided in Table 1. Maintain the plasma factor VIII activity at or above the levels (in % of normal or in IU/dL) outlined in Table 1 for the indicated period. |Type of Bleeding Episode||Factor VIII Level Required (IU/dL or |Duration |Minor| |Early hemarthrosis, minor muscle or oral bleeds.||20-40||12-24||At least 1 day, depending upon the severity of the bleeding episode.| |Moderate| |Bleeding into muscles.| Mild head trauma. Bleeding into the oral cavity. |30-60||12-24||3-4 days or until adequate local Management A guide for dosing XYNTHA during surgery (perioperative management) is provided in Table 2. Maintain the plasma factor VIII activity level at or above the level (in % of normal or in IU/dL) outlined in Table 2 for the indicated period. Monitor the replacement therapy by means of plasma factor VIII activity. |Type of Surgery||Factor VIII Level Required (IU/dL (hours) |Duration of Therapy| (days) |Minor| |Minor operations, including tooth extraction.||30-60||12-24||3-4 days or until adequate local hemostasis is achieved. For tooth extraction, a single infusion plus oral antifibrinolytic therapy within 1 hour may be sufficient.| |Major| |Major operations.||60-100||8-24||Until threat is resolved, or in the case of surgery, until adequate local hemostasis and wound healing are achieved.| Routine Prophylaxis Preparation Note: Reconstitution Note: For intravenous infusion after reconstitution only. Inspect the final XYNTHA solution visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. The solution should be clear to slightly opalescent and colorless. If it is not, discard the solution and use a new kit. Use the tubing and the prefilled diluent syringe provided in this kit or a single sterile disposable plastic syringe. Do not administer XYNTHA in the same tubing or container with other medicinal products. These instructions are for the use of only one XYNTHA Vial Kit with one XYNTHA SOLOFUSE Kit. XYNTHA is available as a white to off-white lyophilized powder in the following nominal dosages: Each XYNTHA vial has the actual recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) potency in International Units stated on the label. XYNTHA is contraindicated in patients who have manifested life-threatening immediate hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, to the product or its components, including hamster proteins. Allergic-type hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, are possible with XYNTHA. Inform patients of the early signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions (including hives [rash with itching], generalized urticaria, chest tightness, wheezing, and hypotension) and anaphylaxis. Discontinue XYNTHA if hypersensitivity symptoms occur and administer appropriate emergency treatment. XYNTHA contains trace amounts of hamster proteins. Patients treated with this product may develop hypersensitivity to these non-human mammalian proteins. Inhibitors have been reported following administration of XYNTHA. Monitor patients for the development of factor VIII inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests. If expected factor VIII activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, perform an assay that measures factor VIII inhibitor concentration to determine if a factor VIII inhibitor is present [see [Warnings and Precautions (5.3)](#S5.3)].4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12 The most common adverse reactions (10%) with XYNTHA in adult and pediatric previously treated patients (PTPs) were headache, arthralgia, pyrexia, and cough. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. XYNTHA was evaluated in five completed clinical studies (N=178), comprising four studies with adult and pediatric PTPs. The safety and efficacy of XYNTHA was evaluated in two completed pivotal studies. In the first study (n=94), safety and efficacy were examined in PTPs with severe to moderately severe hemophilia A (factor VIII activity in plasma [FVIII:C] 2%) who received XYNTHA for routine prophylaxis and on-demand treatment. Ninety-four subjects received at least one dose of XYNTHA, resulting in a total of 6,775 infusions [see [Clinical Studies (14)](#S14)]. The second study (n=30) the use of XYNTHA for surgical prophylaxis in PTPs with severe to moderately severe hemophilia A (FVIII:C 2%) who required elective major surgery and were expected to receive XYNTHA replacement therapy for at least 6 days post-surgery. All subjects received at least one dose of XYNTHA, resulting in 1,161 infusions. One subject received XYNTHA for a pre-surgery pharmacokinetic assessment only and did not undergo surgery [see [Clinical Studies (14)](#S14)]. Across all studies, safety was evaluated in 72 pediatric PTPs <17 years of age (46 subjects <6 years of age (4 subjects were 0 to <2 years of age), 4 subjects 6 to <12 years of age, and 22 adolescents, 12 to <17 years of age). A total of 13,109 infusions of XYNTHA were administered with a median dose per infusion of 28 IU/kg (min-max: 6-108 IU/kg). Across all studies, the most common adverse reactions (10%) with XYNTHA in adult and pediatric PTPs arthralgia (23%), pyrexia (23%), and cough Other in 5% of subjects were: diarrhea (8%), vomiting (8%), and asthenia (6%). There is a potential for immunogenicity with therapeutic proteins. The development of factor VIII inhibitors with XYNTHA was evaluated in 167 adult and pediatric PTPs with at least 50 exposure days (EDs). Laboratory-based assessments for FVIII inhibitor (partial Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda inhibitor assay) were conducted in the clinical studies. The criterion for a positive FVIII result test result was 0.6 BU/mL. Across all studies, 4 subjects developed factor VIII inhibitors (2.4%). The completed clinical studies for XYNTHA examined 178 subjects (30 for surgical prophylaxis) who had previously been treated with factor VIII (PTPs). In the first safety and efficacy study, factor VIII inhibitors were detected in two of 89 subjects (2.2%) who completed 50 EDs. In a Bayesian statistical analysis, results from this study were used to update PTP results from a prior supporting study using XYNTHA manufactured at the initial facility (with one de novo and two recurrent inhibitors observed in 110 subjects) and the experience with predecessor product (with one inhibitor observed in 113 subjects). The Bayesian analysis indicated that the population inhibitor rate for XYNTHA, an estimate of the 95% upper limit of the true inhibitor rate, was 4.17%. None of the PTPs developed anti-CHO anti-TN8.2 antibodies. One PTP developed anti-FVIII antibodies; but, this subject did not develop an inhibitor. In the surgery study, one low titer persistent inhibitor and one transient false-positive inhibitor were reported. In this study, one surgical subject developed anti-CHO cell antibodies with no associated allergic reaction. One subject developed anti-FVIII antibodies; but, this subject did not develop an inhibitor. Across all studies, immunogenicity was evaluated in 64 pediatric PTPs <17 years of age with at least 50 EDs (43 children <6 years of age, 4 subjects 6 to <12 years of age, and 17 adolescents, 12 to <17 years of age). Of these, 2 pediatric subjects developed an inhibitor. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody, including neutralizing antibody, positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparisons of the incidence of antibodies to XYNTHA with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following postmarketing adverse reaction has been reported for XYNTHA: Inadequate therapeutic response Risk Summary It is not known whether XYNTHA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with XYNTHA. There is no information available on the effect of factor VIII replacement therapy on labor and delivery. XYNTHA should be used only if clinically indicated. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of XYNTHA in human milk, the effect on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for XYNTHA and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from XYNTHA or from the underlying maternal condition. Safety and efficacy with XYNTHA were evaluated in clinical studies in 68 pediatric subjects <17 years of age (18 subjects aged 12 to <17 years, 50 subjects aged 12 years). There were no apparent differences in the efficacy and safety in pediatric subjects as compared to adults [see [Adverse Reactions (6.1)](#S6.1) and [Clinical Studies (14)](#S14)]. In comparison to the pharmacokinetic parameters reported in adults, children have shorter half-lives, larger volumes of distribution and lower recovery of factor VIII after XYNTHA administration. The clearance (based on per kg body weight) is approximately 40% higher in children. Higher or more frequent doses may be required to account for the observed differences in pharmacokinetic parameters [see [Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)](#S12.3)]. Clinical studies of XYNTHA did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. The active ingredient in XYNTHA, Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), is a recombinant antihemophilic factor (rAHF), also called coagulation factor VIII, which is produced by recombinant DNA technology. It is secreted by a genetically engineered Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line. The cell line is grown in a chemically defined cell culture medium that contains recombinant insulin, but does not contain any materials derived from human or animal sources. The rAHF in XYNTHA is a purified glycoprotein, with an approximate molecular mass of 170 kDa consisting of 1,438 amino acids, which does not contain the B-domain.13 The amino acid sequence of the rAHF is comparable to the 90 + 80 kDa form of human coagulation factor VIII. The purification process uses a series of chromatography steps, one of which is based on affinity chromatography using a patented synthetic peptide affinity ligand.14 The process also includes a solvent-detergent viral inactivation step and a virus-retaining nanofiltration step. The potency expressed in International Units (IU) is determined using the chromogenic assay of the European Pharmacopoeia. The Wyeth manufacturing reference standard for potency has been calibrated against the World Health Organization (WHO) International Standard for factor VIII activity using the one-stage clotting assay. The specific activity of XYNTHA is 5,500 to 9,900 IU per milligram of protein. XYNTHA is formulated as a sterile, nonpyrogenic, no preservative, lyophilized powder preparation for intravenous injection. Each single-use vial contains nominally 250, 500, 1000, or 2000 IU of XYNTHA. Upon reconstitution, the product is a clear to slightly opalescent, colorless solution that contains sodium chloride, sucrose, L-histidine, calcium chloride, and polysorbate 80. XYNTHA temporarily replaces the missing clotting factor VIII that is needed for effective hemostasis. The activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is prolonged in patients with hemophilia. Determination of aPTT is a conventional in vitro assay for biological activity of factor VIII. Treatment with XYNTHA normalizes the aPTT over the effective dosing period. The pharmacokinetic parameters of XYNTHA in 30 PTPs 12 to 60 years old, who received a single infusion of 50 IU/kg XYNTHA are summarized in Table 3. In addition, 25 of the same subjects later received a single infusion of 50 IU/kg of XYNTHA for a 6-month follow-up pharmacokinetic study. The parameters were comparable between baseline and 6 months, indicating no time-dependent changes in the pharmacokinetics of XYNTHA. In a separate study, 8 of 30 subjects at least 12 years old with hemophilia A undergoing elective major surgery received a single 50 IU/kg infusion of XYNTHA. The pharmacokinetic parameters in these subjects are also summarized in Table 3. |Parameter||Initial Visit| (n = 30) |Month 6| (n = 25) (n=8) |Abbreviations: AUC = area under the plasma concentration-time from zero to infinity; Cmax = peak concentration; t1/2 = plasma = clearance; number of subjects; SD = standard deviation; pharmacokinetic parameters of nine children; four aged 14 or 15 years of age, who are also included in the summary for the adults above, along with five children aged 3.7-5.8 years after single 50 IU/kg doses of XYNTHA. Compared to adults, the half-life of XYNTHA is shorter in children and the clearance (based on per kg body weight) is approximately 40% higher in children. |Parameter||Young Children (n = 5)||Adolescents (n = 4)| |Abbreviations: AUC = area under the plasma concentration-time curve from zero to infinity; Cmax = peak concentration; t1/2 = plasma = clearance; number of subjects; SD = standard deviation; been conducted with XYNTHA to assess its mutagenic or carcinogenic potential. XYNTHA has been shown to be comparable to the predecessor product with respect to its biochemical and physicochemical properties, as well as its nonclinical in vivo pharmacology and toxicology. By inference, predecessor product and XYNTHA would be expected to have equivalent mutagenic and carcinogenic potential. The predecessor product has been shown to be nongenotoxic in the mouse micronucleus assay. No studies have been conducted in animals to assess impairment of fertility or fetal development. Preclinical studies evaluating XYNTHA in hemophilia A dogs without inhibitors demonstrated safe and effective restoration of hemostasis. XYNTHA demonstrated a toxicological profile that was similar to the toxicological profile observed with the predecessor product. Toxicity associated with XYNTHA was primarily associated with anti-FVIII neutralizing antibody generation first detectable at 15 days of repeat dosing in high (approximately 735 IU/kg/day) level-dosed, non-human primates. Three completed multicenter, open-label studies support the analysis of safety and efficacy of XYNTHA in on-demand treatment and control of bleeding episodes and perioperative management, and routine prophylaxis in PTPs with hemophilia A. These completed clinical studies for XYNTHA examined 174 PTP subjects, 94 from the first study, and 50 from a second study, for on-demand treatment and routine prophylaxis and 30 from a third study for surgical prophylaxis. Subjects with severe to moderately severe hemophilia A (FVIII:C 2%) and no history of FVIII inhibitors were eligible for the trials. On-demand Treatment and Control of Bleeding Episodes On-demand treatment in adolescents and adults Ninety-four (94) subjects, 12 years of age and older received XYNTHA in a routine prophylaxis treatment regimen with on-demand treatment administered as clinically indicated. All 94 subjects were treated with at least one dose and all are included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. Eighty-nine (89) subjects accrued 50 EDs. Median age for the 94 treated subjects was 24 years (mean 28 and min-max: 12-60 years). Of these 94 subjects, 30 evaluable in a randomized crossover of both the first (PK1) on-demand treatment for a total of 187 bleeding episodes. Seven of these bleeding episodes occurred in subjects prior to switching to a prophylaxis treatment regimen. One hundred ten of 180 bleeds (110/180 or 61%) occurred 48 hours after the last dose and 39% (70/180 bleeds) occurred >48 hours after the last dose. The majority of bleeds reported to occur 48 hours after the last prophylaxis dose were traumatic (64/110 bleeds or 58%). Forty-two bleeds (42/70 or 60%) reported to occur >48 hours after the last prophylaxis dose were spontaneous. The on-demand treatment dosing regimen was determined by the investigator. The median dose for on-demand treatment was 31 IU/kg (min-max: 6-74 IU/kg) and the median exposure per subject was 3 days (min-max: 1-26). The majority of bleeding episodes (173/187 or 93%) resolved with 1 or 2 infusions (Table 5). One hundred thirty-two of 187 bleeding episodes (132/187 or 71%) treated with XYNTHA were rated excellent or good in their response to initial treatment, 45 (24%) were rated moderate. Five (3%) were rated no response, and 5 (3%) were not rated. |Response to 1st Infusion||Number of Infusions| (%) 1 |Number of Infusions| (%) 2 |Number of Infusions| (%) 3 Number of Bleeds| |Excellent| Of the 94 subjects described above, in the first completed open-label safety and efficacy study of XYNTHA, 18 were adolescent subjects 12 to <17 years of age with severe to moderately severe hemophilia A (FVIII:C 2%). Ten (10) of these adolescent subjects, received XYNTHA for the on-demand treatment of 66 bleeding episodes, with the majority of the bleeding episodes (63/66 or 95%) resolving with 1 or 2 infusions. The response to infusion was rated on a pre-specified 4 point hemostatic efficacy scale. Thirty-eight (38) of 66 bleeding episodes (58%) were rated excellent or good in their response to initial treatment, 24 (36%) were rated as moderate, and 4 (6%) were not rated. The median dose per on demand infusion was 47 IU/kg (min-max: 24-74). On-demand treatment in children Additional data for 50 subjects are available from a second safety and efficacy study of XYNTHA in children (12 years of age) with severe to moderately severe hemophilia A (FVIII:C 2%). Of the 50 subjects, 38 subjects received XYNTHA for on-demand and follow-up treatment of 562 bleeding episodes with the majority of the bleeding episodes (518/562 or 92%) resolving with 1 or 2 infusions. Of 559 bleeding episodes treated with XYNTHA with response assessments to the first infusion, 526 (94%) were rated excellent or good in their response to initial treatment and 27 (5%) were rated as moderate. The median dose per on-demand infusion was 28 IU/kg (min-max: 10-92). Perioperative Management In a study (n=30) for surgical prophylaxis in subjects with hemophilia A, XYNTHA was administered to 25 efficacy-evaluable PTPs undergoing major surgical procedures (11 total knee replacements, 1 hip replacement, 5 synovectomies, 1 left ulnar nerve transposition release, 1 ventral hernia repair/scar revision, 1 knee arthroscopy, 1 revision and debridement of the knee after a total knee replacement, 1 hip arthroplasty revision, 1 stapes replacement, 1 ankle arthrodesis, and 1 pseudotumor excision).17 The results of the hemostatic efficacy ratings for these subjects are presented in Table 6. Investigator's ratings of efficacy at the end of surgery and at the end of the initial postoperative period were excellent or good for all assessments. Intraoperative blood loss was reported as \"normal\" or \"absent\" for all subjects. Thirteen of the subjects (13/25 or 52%) had blood loss in the postoperative period. The postoperative blood loss was rated as \"normal\" for ten of these cases while three cases were rated \"abnormal\" (1 due to hemorrhage following surgical trauma to the epigastric artery, 1 due to an 800 mL blood loss after hip replacement surgery, and 1 after an elbow synovectomy where the blood loss could not be measured by the investigator). |Time of Hemostatic Efficacy Assessment||Excellent| Routine Prophylaxis One hundred and two (102) subjects (94 subjects 12 years of age and 8 subjects <12 years of age) received XYNTHA for routine prophylaxis, for comparison of annualized bleeding rate (ABR) to on-demand treatment alone as a part of 2 completed studies. XYNTHA was administered for routine prophylaxis at a dose of 25 \u00b1 5 IU/kg every other day (in subjects <12 years of age) or 30 \u00b1 5 IU/kg administered 3 times weekly (in subjects 12 years of age or older), with provisions for dose escalation based on pre-specified criteria (over a 4-week period, 2 spontaneous bleeds into a major joint and/or target joint, or 3 or more spontaneous bleeding episodes in any location). Among these 102 subjects, 7 dose escalations were prescribed for 6 subjects. In subjects 12 years, 42 subjects (42/94 or 45%) reported no bleeding while on routine prophylaxis. The mean\u00b1SD total ABR during routine prophylaxis was 4.0\u00b16.64 with median (min-max) of 1.9 (0.0-44.2). The mean ABR for subjects during routine prophylaxis was 88% lower than the mean ABR for subjects during on-demand treatment (Table 7). In subjects <12 years, 4 subjects (4/8 or 50%) reported no bleeding while on routine prophylaxis. The mean\u00b1SD total ABR during routine prophylaxis was 1.5\u00b12.2 with median (min-max) of 0.6 (0.0-6.2). The mean ABR for subjects during routine prophylaxis was 97% lower than the mean ABR for subjects during on-demand treatment (Table 7). |Age Category (years)||Number of Subjects||% Reduction from OD||Treated = on demand; ABR = annualized bleeding rate; SD = standard deviation, Min = minimum, Max syringe containing 4 mL 0.9% Sodium Chloride with plunger rod for assembly, one vial adapter, one sterile infusion set, two alcohol swabs, one bandage, one gauze pad, and one package insert.

There may be new information. This leaflet does not take the place of talking with your healthcare provider about your medical problems or your treatment. What is XYNTHA? XYNTHA is an injectable medicine that is used to help control and reduce bleeding in people with hemophilia A. Hemophilia A is also called classic hemophilia. Your healthcare provider may give you XYNTHA when you have surgery. XYNTHA is not used to treat von Willebrand's disease. What should I tell my healthcare provider before using XYNTHA? Tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you: Tell your healthcare provider about all of the medicines you take, including all prescription and non-prescription medicines, such as over-the-counter medicines, supplements, or herbal remedies. How should I infuse XYNTHA? Step-by-step instructions for infusing with XYNTHA are provided at the end of this leaflet. The steps listed below are general guidelines for using XYNTHA. Always follow any specific instructions from your healthcare provider. If you are unsure of the procedures, please call your healthcare provider before using. Call your healthcare provider right away if bleeding is not controlled after using XYNTHA. Call your healthcare provider right away if you take more than the dose you should take. Talk to your healthcare provider before traveling. Plan to bring enough XYNTHA for your treatment during this time. What are the possible side effects of XYNTHA? Call your healthcare provider or go to the emergency department right away if you have any of the following symptoms because these may be signs of a serious allergic reaction: Common side effects of XYNTHA are Your body can make antibodies against XYNTHA (called \"inhibitors\") that may stop XYNTHA from working properly. Your healthcare provider may need to take blood tests from time to time to monitor for inhibitors. Talk to your healthcare provider about any side effect that bothers you or that does not go away. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. How should I store XYNTHA? Store XYNTHA in the refrigerator at 36\u00b0 to 77\u00b0F (2\u00b0 to 25\u00b0C). Do not freeze. Protect from light. XYNTHA can last at room temperature (below 77\u00b0F) for up to 3 months. If you store XYNTHA at room temperature, carefully write down the date you put XYNTHA at room temperature, so you will know when to either put it back in the refrigerator, use it immediately, or throw it away. There is a space on the carton for you to write the date. If stored at room temperature, XYNTHA can be returned one time to the refrigerator until the expiration date. Do not store at room temperature and return it to the refrigerator more than once. Throw away any unused XYNTHA after the expiration date. Infuse XYNTHA within 3 hours of reconstitution. You can keep the reconstituted solution at room temperature before infusion for up to 3 hours. If you have not used it in 3 hours, throw it away. Do not use reconstituted XYNTHA if it is not clear to slightly opalescent and colorless. Dispose of all materials, whether reconstituted or not, in an appropriate medical waste container.
