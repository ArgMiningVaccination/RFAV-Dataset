Toll-like receptor 2 and NALP2 mediate induction of human beta-defensins epithelial autoinflammatory andautoimmune disorders To the Editor: A20, which is encoded by the tumor necrosis factor alpha induced protein 3 ( TNFAIP3 ) gene, is a negative regulator of the TNF-nuclear factor- kB signaling pathway. It had been reported that several autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, Crohn disease, and type1 diabetes, are associated with TNFAIP3 gene polymorphisms. 1 Recently, heterozygous germline mutations in the TNFAIP3 gene have been found to cause the haploinsufciency of A20(HA20), which displays an early-onset autoinflammatory diseaseresembling Behc \u00b8et disease. Initially, 6 families of patients with HA20 were described by Zhou et al. Subsequently, 3 additional families and sporadic cases were reported. 2The major phenotype of HA20 is Behc \u00b8et disease-like symptoms, including a recurrent aphthous stomatitis, genital ulcers, and intestinal symptoms. However, some patients present with not only the symptoms ofautoinflammatory disorders but also several autoimmune-like symptoms. 2,3Therefore, these preceding clinical reports sug- gested that there might be unexpected phenotypes in HA20. Inthis study, we performed a multicenter survey investigating thepatients with HA20 found in Japan. A total of 30 patients from 9 unrelated families were enrolled in this study. Twenty-two patients were identied as havingmutations in the TNFAIP3 genes, and the other 8 patients were clinically diagnosed as having HA20 as a result of a Behc \u00b8et dis- ease-like phenotype with an autosomal-dominant-inheritancetrait ( Fig 1 ,A). The clinical proles are described in Table I and inTable E1 in this article's Online Repository at www. jacionline.org . Additional case reports are described in this arti- cle's Methods section in the Online Repository at www. jacionline.org . Three mutations in the TNFAIP3 gene had been previously reported; however, 6 were novel. All these mutationswere evaluated to be functionally pathogenic by several in vitro assays (see Figs E1-E4 in this article's Online Repository at a Behc \u00b8et disease-like pheno- type. The original description showed that all patients with HA20had recurrent aphthous stomatitis and genital ulcers. The patients included in our study also developed some Behc \u00b8et disease-like phenotypes; however, 59% of the patients did not fulll the International Study Group for Behc \u00b8et's disease 1990 criteria. 4 Intriguingly, 5 patients had only recurrent aphthous stomatitis, and some of them were initially diagnosed as having periodic fe- ver, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis syndrome.Furthermore, patient 4 (P4), showing typical recurrent fever andabdominal pain, was initially diagnosed as having colchicine- resistant familial Mediterranean fever, and she was treated with etanercept. Therefore, in some conditions, HA20 might be dif-cult to discriminate from other autoinflammatory disorders. Simi- larly to typical Behc \u00b8et disease, the symptoms of HA20 tend to increase with aging. In many cases, the initial symptom ofHA20 is not a recurrent stomatitis. 5For example, polyarthritis ap- peared before the onset of stomatitis, genital ulcers, and intestinal manifestations in P1, P3, and P10. Regarding the relatively low-frequency phenotypes of Behc \u00b8et disease, uveitis was not found in our series (see Table E2 in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org ). Patients with HA20 are juvenile-onset and partially resemble those with Behc \u00b8et disease, but their phenotypes are distinct from those of classical Behc \u00b8et disease. We could not demonstrate genotype-phenotype correlation in our series. In general, autosomal-dominant-inheritance diseasesoften show variable penetrance in the same family. Some patients are severely affected, whereas other family members are mildly or not affected. This might indicate the possibility of additionaleffects with other genetic, ethnic, or environmental factors, such as vaccinations or infections. Furthermore, genetic analysis of the asymptomatic individuals, the mother of P2 and the father of P21,revealed low-frequency mosaicism (see Fig E5 in this article's On- line Repository at www.jacionline.org ). As one of the possible modier effects, this result suggests that germline mosaicism or so- matic reversions might modulate these disease phenotypes as hasbeen observed in other diseases including DOCK8 deciency. 6 The patients with HA20 showed an excess production of proinflammatory cytokines. We evaluated the serum cytokinelevels between and IP-10 were also increased in nonflare periods ( Fig 1 ,B). Furthermore, the production levels of proinflammatory cytokines by PBMCs were increased as previ-ously reported ( Fig 1 ,C). These results suggest that the constitu- tional autoinflammation of patients with HA20 occurs not only in TNF signaling but also in IL-1- or IL-18-related inflammasome activation. In fact, the refractory cases in our cohort were treatedwith anti-TNF- aagents, and it successfully induced the remission. A most noteworthy aspect of this study is the association with autoimmune disorders. Zhou et al described the increased differ-entiation of T H9 and T H17 in HA20. However, the excess differ- entiation of T H17 cells, but not T H9 cells, was observed in our study ( Fig 1 ,C; see Fig E6 in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org ). The differentiation of T H17 cells was marked with aging. Other genetic factors might therefore affect the differentiation of T H9 cells. In contrast, T H17 cells might play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of HA20. T H17 is well known as playing a role in autoimmunity.7Intriguingly, not only autoinflammatory phenotypes but also several autoimmune disorders, including systemic lupus psoriaticarthritis, autoimmune hepatitis, 1485Hashimoto's were identied study ( Table I ). Se- vere psoriatic arthritis with the prominent elevation of T H17 cells was observed in P3. He also had another possible genetic factor, HLA-B27, which is known to cause psoriatic arthritis, ankylosingspondylitis, and reactive arthritis. 8Symptoms featuresof P3. HA20 might drive the other genetic factors associated with autoimmune disorders, such as HLA-B27. These features of human HA20 are compatible with a previous report on aging heterozygous TNFAIP3 knockout mice.1,9Therefore, we consider that autoimmunity is a possible complication of HA20, especially with aging and/or the accumulation of other genetic factors.

Amb a 1, a member of the pectate lyase C (pelC) family, is a highlyallergenic molecule recognized by more than 90% ofragweed-sensitized individuals and accounts for more than 90% of the allergenic activity in ragweed pollen. 1However, the factors/features responsible for its high allergenicity (ie, capacity to induce specic IgE antibodies) remain undened. Efforts tounderstand allergenicity have lately focused on extrinsic factors normally accompanying the allergen during the initial interaction with the immune system (eg, TLR ligands and lipid mediators). 2 However, data from our previous studies suggested that intrinsicfeatures of Amb a 1 might be linked to its high allergenic potential. 3Thus, we sought to investigate intrinsic molecular pattern(s) possibly involved in the allergenicity of Amb a 1. Asa comparison, we used the nonallergenic pelC allergenic isoform, was puried from ragweed pollen extracts, whereas the bacterial-derived pelC (DC-pelC) was produced as a soluble recombinant protein inEscherichia coli (seeFig E1 ,A, in this article's Online Repository atwww.jacionline.org ). After purication, their identity and were conrmed by mass spectrometry ( Fig E1 ,BandC). Despite their relatively low sequence identity (24%), circulardichroism and Fourier-transform infrared experiments indicated the presence of the parallel beta-helix structural element typical for polysaccharide lyases from family 1, with a high beta-sheetcontent (35.6% to 40.5%) for both molecules (see Fig E2 in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org ). These results support the notion that the 2 proteins share some degree ofstructural similarity ( Fig E2 ,D). However, because of low sequence identity, cross-reactivity is not expected. Because Dickeya species are known to cause soft root disease on many crops (eg, bell pepper, tomatoes, potatoes, and onions) 4 and ornamental indoor plants, contact with this phytopathogen has been recently demonstrated by metagenomic sequencing of Dickeya an oral commensal bacterium. Thus, we performed ELISAs to evaluate immune responses to DC-pelC. None of the 39 ragweed-allergic patientsdisplayed IgE or IgG 4antibodies recognizing DC-pelC. However, the individuals showed IgG antibodies against DC-pelC, conrming exposure but no sensitization to DC-pelC (see Fig E3 in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org ). To further investigate the sensitization capacity of Amb a 1.01 and DC-pelC, we immunized mice in the presence andabsence of aluminum hydroxide (ALUM) as adjuvant ( Fig 1 ,A). In both immunization protocols, Amb a 1.01 behaved as a very potent sensitizer, inducing high levels of IgG and IgE antibodies (Fig 1 ,B). These results clearly demonstrate that the intrinsic allergenic properties of Amb a 1.01 were not signicantly altered by adsorption to ALUM as adjuvant. In contrast, in the adjuvant-free model, the nonallergenic pectate lyase DC-pelC induced a moderate response with low levels of IgG 1and IgG 2aantibodies and failed to initiate B-cell class switch for IgE production. When ALUM was coadministeredwith DC-pelC, a observed. In addition, DC- pelC-specic IgE antibody titers increased slightly, showing mediator release capacity in only 2 out of 5 mice ( Fig 1 ,C and E). The amount of DC-pelC needed to induce half- maximal release in basophils sensitized with sera from those without ALUM did notdiffer signicantly ( Fig 1 ,D).

P1 and P2 in Family 1 were genetically conrmed to have HA20.E1A deceased maternal grandfather of P1 with Behc \u00b8et disease might have had HA20. P2 was found to have antithyroid peroxidase antibody at the age of 39 years, even though the thyroid functions were normal. Family 2. The proband of Family 2 was a 4-year-old boy (P3). He had recurrent febrile episodes following pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV)at the age of 2, 3, and 7 months. He developed swelling of the left middle nger and the left fth toe from age 6 months. The X-ray disclosed bone thickening at the proximal phalanx of the left middle nger (red arrow) and the left fthtoe (Fig E7 ,A). He was diagnosed as having systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis and treated with prednisolone (PSL) and methotrexate at the age of 1 year. Enhanced magnetic resonance imaging showed polyarthritis including enthesitis of his left Achilles tendon and thickening of his right knee jointcapsule ( Fig E7 ,B). In addition, aortic valve insufciency was found at the age of 1 year and 6 months, and tocilizumab was initiated. Psoriatic skin rash and nail deformation appeared at the age of 2 years and 5 months. A skin biopsy revealed an epidermis with scabbing E7 ,C). He was diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis, and was treated with adalimumab (ADA) instead of tocilizumab at the age of 2 years and 8 months. ADA was switched to etanercept (ETA) because of the ineffectiveness of ADA causedby anti-ADA antibody. Afterwards, his symptoms were nearly stable. During tapering PSL, he had arthritis of cervical vertebra at the age of 4 years. For that reason, we changed ETA to infliximab. Finally, he was identied as having aheterozygous c.2088 15G>C mutation in TNFAIP3 (Fig E2 ). Interestingly, was asymptomatic; however, genetic analysis revealed low-frequency somatic mosaicism of TNFAIP3 in her peripheral blood ( Fig E5 ,A). The fre- quency of the mutant allele from her peripheral blood was estimated as10.06% by next-generation sequencing. Family 3. P4, a 4.5-year-old girl, is the proband of Family 3. P4 and P9 showed relatively and P7had Hashimoto's thyroiditis. P4 had recurrent flare with severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and bloody stool since age 6 months. Abdominal lymphedema and mild intestinal edema were observed on her abdominalcontrast-enhanced computed tomography during flare ( Fig E7 ,D). First, she was considered as a possible case of familial Mediterranean fever according to the Tel-Hashomer criteria, E2but the genetic analysis of the MEFV gene was normal. Colchicine was not effective. Then, she was tentatively diag-nosed as having TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome variant due to the heterozygous Thr61Ile variant in the TNFRSF1A gene. E3At the age of 3 years and 1 month, ETA was started and the flaring events havesubsided. Although she was not under suspicion of Behc \u00b8et disease, the heterozygous c.2209delC mutation in TNFAIP3 was identied. P9 is an 11-month-old girl, a maternal cousin of P4. She had a febrile episode following PCV vaccinations at the ages of 2 and 4 months. At the age of9 months, she had a febrile episode with interstitial pneumonia and cheilitis,and CSF analysis showed an increase in mononuclear leukocytes (76/ protein (172 mg/dL), and IL-6 (6790 pg/mL). This febrile episode lasted for 10 days. She had a severe crustose lesion on the inoculation site ofBCG vaccine after this febrile episode ( Fig E7 ,E). Family 4. P10, a 6-year-and-1-month-old boy, is the proband of Family 4. This family included 2 patients with HA20 (P10 and P11) and 3 possible cases who had Behc \u00b8et disease-like phenotypes. P10 had arthritis of the right knee joint, both ankle joints, and right toes at the age of 3 years and 6 months. Hewas initially diagnosed as having polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis,and a combination of PSL and methotrexate therapy was administrated. Although symptoms of arthritis improved, continuous positive serum C- reactive protein levels were noted. After withdrawal of the PSL therapy at theage of 4 years and 2 months, he had periodic fever with lymphadenopathy,exudative tonsillitis, and aphthous stomatitis every 2 to 2 months. At this time, he was diagnosed as having periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis syndrome. E4Then, the frequency of his febrile attacks was decreased using cimetidine, but his serum C-reactive protein level was contin-uously positive even in nonflare periods. He had a heterozygousc.1906 11G>A mutation in TNFAIP3 (Fig E2 ). P11 is a 33-year-old man, and the father of P10. He had recurrent aphthous stomatitis since his child- hood. He was previously diagnosed as having IgA vasculitis at the age of 13to 14 years. To date, he developed occasional genital and anal ulceration.He also had abdominal pain and diarrhea once a month. The mother, older brother, and younger brother of P11 also showed recurrent aphthous stomati- tis, P16 were genetically conrmed to have HA20, and 1 patient in Family 5 with Behc \u00b8et disease might have had HA20. E5 Rituximab was used for refractory nephrotic syndrome in P12. Family 6. Family 6 included 2 patients with HA20 (P17 and P18) and 3 possible cases disease-like phenotypes. P17, who was a 7-year- old girl, is the proband of this family. She had a history of RBV-induced infectious mononucleosis with an extreme elevation of peripheral lympho- cytes at the age of 1 year and was treated with corticosteroid. She had periodicfebrile episodes every month and aphthous stomatitis every day from her infancy. The frequency of her febrile episodes gradually decreased, but stomatitis continued every day afterwards. She felt general fatigue andexperienced a fever attack on the day after hard exercise. In addition, she wasdiagnosed as having pervasive developmental disorder at the age of 7 years. She had a heterozygous c.1345delA mutation in TNFAIP3 . P18 is a 42-year- old woman, and the mother of P17. She had recurrent aphthous stomatitis sinceher early childhood and had recurrent fever, abdominal pain, and diarrheasince her teens. She was diagnosed as having Behc \u00b8et disease at the age of 21 years, because of genital ulcers. Her symptoms were stable for the next 10 years, but relapsed after pregnancy. She developed colon perforation andpneumocystis pneumonia at the age of 39 years. The mother, younger sister, and niece of P18 also showed recurrent aphthous stomatitis since their child- hood. Recently, the mother of P18 was diagnosed as having malignant lym-phoma in her seventies. The niece of P18 had periodic fever episodes sinceher early childhood. She was diagnosed as having Crohn disease at the age of 8 years, and treatment with ADA was started. At the age of 14 years, she was diagnosed with Behc \u00b8et disease due to complications of genital ulcers. Although a genetic test was not performed, she might also have hadHA20. Family 7. Family 7 includes 2 patients with HA20 (P19 and P20). P19, a 5-year-and-2-month-old boy, is the proband of this family. He had a fever and oral ulcer at the age of 5 days. He was initially diagnosed as having sepsis and herpetic stomatitis and treated with an antibiotic and acyclovir. He also hadperiproctitis during this treatment. He had recurrent aphthous stomatitis once aweek since the age of 1 month. He had prolonged fever with periproctitis for 10 days at the age of 5 months. He was frequently hospitalized because of recurrent fever, aphthous stomatitis, and periproctitis thereafter. At the age of1 year, colonoscopy revealed the ulceration of rectum and colon. Therefore, he was diagnosed as having nonspecic inflammatory bowel disease and treated with mesalazine. He had heterozygous c.1760_1770del11 mutation inTNFAIP3 . Colchicine was insufcient. Infliximab treatment was started recently. He had fever episodes after inoculations of PCV at the age of 2, 3, and 5 months. P20 is a 33-year-old man, the father of P19. He had recurrent aphthous stomatitis. He had febrile episodes lasting for 1 week once or twicea year from the age of 20 years. At the age of 20 years, he was also diagnosed ashaving Graves' disease. Serum autoantibodies associated with the thyroid were detected at the age of 33 years, not only anti-thyroid-stimulating hor- mone receptor autoantibodies but also anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody andantithyroglobulin antibody. Family 8. Family 8 included a genetically conrmed patient with HA20 (P21). E6At the age of 4 years, because of the prolonged inflammatory bowel disease, ADA treatment was started, and then his symptoms were dramatically improved. Other Behc \u00b8et disease-like symptoms were not found. It should be noted that his father has not been showing any inflammatory signs, but the ge-netic analysis showed the low-frequency somatic mosaicism of TNFAIP3 in his peripheral blood ( Fig E5 ,B). The frequency of the mutant allele of his pe- ripheral blood was estimated as 16.7% (5 of 30) on the basis of subcloning andsequencing analysis. Family 9. The proband (P22) of Family 9 was a 7-year-and-11-month-old boy. He had recurrent flare lasting for 1 week, once for 2 or 3 months, from theJ ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL APRIL 20181488.e1 LETTERS TO THE EDITORage of 1 year. He was initially diagnosed as having periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis syndrome at the age of 2 years. Then, the frequency of flare episodes gradually decreased, but since the age of 5 yearsthe frequency of fever episodes increased. PSL treatment was not effective. Hehad prolonged fever, aphthous stomatitis, and perianal ulcer at the age of 6 years.

He had a c.133G >T mutation in TNFAIP3 . Analysis of cytokine levels Regarding the cytokine proles, blood samples were obtained from each patient and healthy volunteers. PBMCs were isolated from heparinized blood by gradient centrifugation using Ficoll-Paque (GE Healthcare, Uppsala,Sweden). PBMCs were seeded at a density of 10 6cells/mL, and cultured in the presence or absence of 100 ng/mL LPS from Escherichia coli 0127:B8 (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, Mo) or 10 mg/mL PHA (Gibco, Life Technologies Corp., Grand Island, NY) for 24 hours in 24-well plates at 37 8C.

BandC, Complementary DNA analysis of the splice site mutations. The regions of TNFAIP3 in which the mutations c.1906 11G>A and c.2088 15G>C are located were amplied using the forward primer 5 9-GAAGTG GACTTCAGTACAAC-3 9and the reverse primer 5 9-GGTTACCAAACCTGAGCATC-3 9, and then, Sanger DNA sequencing was performed. c.2088 15G>C showed an additional lower band of the predicted size (1998bp), and c.1906 11G>A also showed 1 more upper band. The direct sequencing of these PCR products showed that P3 had a heterozygous exon 8 skipping mutation and P10 had a heterozygous intron 7 insertionmutation.

Western blot HEK293T cells transfected with pcDNA3.1 1myc-A20 (WT or variants). The control subject showed the protein expression of myc-A20 corresponding to the predicted molecular weight size of 89.5 kDa. The protein expressions of R45X (5.2 kDa) and W85GfsX11 (11.2 kDa) could not be detected because of the detection limitof the gel. The expression level of C243Y was reduced. The other variantswere detected as corresponding to the predicted molecular weight.J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL APRIL 20181488.e5 LETTERS TO THE EDITORFIG NF-kB reporter gene activity assay.

Flow cytometric analysis of T H17 cells. Upper panels (A)are representative flow cytometry plots of IL-4 and IL-17A expression by intracellular cytokine staining. Lower panels (B)are flow cytometry plots of IL- 17A expression in patients with HA20 (n 516) as compared with control subjects (n 540). The cases are grouped into 3 categories: younger than 2 years, 2 years old to 15 years old, and older than 15 years. Theproportion of T H17 cells in patients with HA20 (3.3% 63.5%) was signicantly higher than that of control subjects (1.4% 60.7%; P5.0006).
