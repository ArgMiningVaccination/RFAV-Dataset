Background The Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (hereinafter referred to as PHS Policy) requires institutions receiving PHS funds to establish and maintain a program for the care and use of animals in research and teaching, us ing the current Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Guide ) as the basis for said program. An essential component of this program is for the institution to have a health program for all individuals who are listed on an Animal Use Protocol (AUP) and/or work in laboratory animal facilities or have contact with animals. The nature of the institutions' occupational health and safety program will depend on the type of facility, research activity, animal species involved, frequency of animal cont act or exposure, and associated risks for workers. Accordingly, the program may not affect all individuals equally. II. Policy Oversight and evaluation of the University of California, Berkeley's (UCB) animal care and use program is the responsibility of the Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC), Attending Veterinarian (AV), and the Institutional Official (IO). In cooperation with the UCB's University Health Service (UHS) Occupational Health Clinic , an occupational health and safety program as it pertains to animal use has been developed. The ACUC requires people working with some species (e.g. bats and NHP) to enroll and based on medical risk other individuals may also be required to enroll in the Animal Occupational Health and Safety Program (AOHSP) prior to beginning their work or contact with animals. The following parameters apply and an individual's personal health status will have an effect on any recommendations made by UHS's Occupational Health Clinic medical staff. The following individuals (below) are required to enroll in the AOHSP and complete the initial baseline Occupational Health Surveillance System (OHSS) evaluation which includes an initial Risk Assessment (RA) done by the PI of the AUP the individual is on (or the person's supervisor); and, the individual must submit a personal Health Questionnaire (HQ) as well as complete any OHC Medical Assessment (MA) follow -up (e.g. blood tests, fit testing) prior to beginning their work or contact with animals : University of California, Berkeley - Animal Care and Use Program Animal Care and Use Committee Page 2 of 9 Last Revised: 2/8/2023 1. All individuals nam ed on a research or teaching Animal Use Protocol (AUP) ; and, 2. Any individual who through their employment has contact with or exposure to live animals, must enroll in the Animal Occupational Health and Safety Program (AOHSP). The Risk Categories for Animal Research specify the minimum participation and time period approved/ covered before a RA , HQ and MA should be re -reviewed. Renewal time frames for individuals after the initial baseline OHSS evaluation are as follows: 1) Risk Category A - 6 month Approval Period a. Mandatory Semi -annual Renewal i. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) Work 2) Risk Category B - Annual Approval Period a. Mandatory Annual Renewal i. Non-Human Primate Work ii. SARS- CoV-2 Work b. Strongly recommended Annual Renewal (but not required ) i. Rodents ( mice, rats, tuco tucos, guinea pigs, etc.) ii. Wild Animals / Field Work 3) Risk Category C - 2 Year Approval Period a. Mandatory (RA and MA) i. Bats ii. Rabies Virus or Pseudo- type Rabies iii. Field work involving exposure to animals that may carry Rabies 4) Risk Category D - 3 Year Approval Period a. All personnel - except those covered by Risk Category E - must be current on their RA, MA and HQ at the time of the AUP's de Novo / Continuing Review prior to the AUP being reapproved by ACUC. PI/Supervisors, whose staff member's OHSS risk assessments do not correspond with the AUP de Novo schedule, are responsible for ensuring that they review the RA to meet the 3 year renewal requirement appropriately for all lab members unless they are covered under item 5 below. (See Appendix 1 instructions , Ongoing Assessment steps 1-3). b. Birds 5) Risk Category E - 3 Year Approval (Continued participation is Optional after initial Baseline RA and HQ; and, meeting a ny MA requirements ) a. Fish b. Amphibians c. Reptiles III. Applicability A. This policy applies to all employees, students, volunteers, visiting researchers, and non- UC collaborators who are listed on an Animal Care University of California, Berkeley - Animal Care and Use Program Animal Care and Use Committee Page 3 of 9 Last Revised: 2/8/2023 and Use Protocol and/or work with live, vertebrate animals in research or teaching are required to participate, as detailed below, in the U C Berkeley AOHSP. Even PIs who do not themselves work directly with animals are required to enroll in the AOHSP using the Occupational Health Surveillance System (OHSS). B. Students whose only animal exposure is in the classroom or in the field as part of a course are not required to enroll. However, the instructor should provide information (i.e. an AOHSP Handout) about any potential health risks with the animal species being used during the course. An AOHSP Handout, reviewed by the OHC is available from O ACU. C. All OLAC personnel (e.g., animal care staff, animal health technicians, and veterinarians) who work i n animal facilities or have contact with laboratory animals or animal tissues are required to participate in the program as well. They are all required to use OHSS, make appointments and come through the clinic on initial hire and annually thereafter. D. Other university employees who may have intermittent exposure in the course of their employment (e.g. , physical facilities personnel) but with less frequency than animal technicians or research lab staff are identified by their department and OLAC staff if t here is a specific reason that they will need screening. They are then required to make an appointment with the Occupational Health Clinic. Once the clinic staff have evaluated the employee, they send a clearance to the department to let them know if they are cleared to be in the specific animal area that the department had requested. E. Individuals working with nonhuman primates (NHPs), in addition to completing a HQ via OHSS, are required to enroll in NHP medical screening. F. Members of the ACUC and Office for Animal Care and Use (OACU) staff must also enroll and participate in the OHSS. G. Visiting scientists or researchers - Non-UC Berkeley c ollaborators may submit a Visitor Form verifying that they participate in their AAALAC Accredited home institution's Occupational Health program as long as the individual is working under a protocol at their home institution and has clearance working with the same species. Individuals fro m non -accredited organizations or who are not cleared for the same species at their home institution will need to arrange clearance through the PI they are working under at UC Berkeley . Other short -term visitor s who may not be handling animals but will be in the animal facilities or working with animal tissues must complete the Visito r Form (see Appendi x 2 for a copy) and submit it to the Occupational Health C linic for clear ance to proceed.

Program Components for Individuals Listed on an AUP A. Enrollment for an individual in the program is completed in four steps via the Occupational Health Surveillance System (OHSS): 1. The Supervisor (generally the PI or Lab Manager) creates a Risk Assessment (RA) for the individual. This risk assessment can be copied for all lab members working with similar risks and hazards. 2. The individual must review and agree to the RA as shared with them and then, if they agree with the assessment, complete a Health Questionnaire (HQ) about their personal health information and history. This information is HIPAA protected and data is stored with high security standards as required by law . 3. An Occupational Health Physician (or N urse Practitioner) will review the RA and the HQ and determine a) if no further action required; or, b) if the individual needs additional follow up or medical consultation. This results in a Medical Assessment (MA) being issued through the OHSS softwar e system. 4. The individual must acknowledge ( i.e. respond) to the medical professional's assessment electronically and then follow -up with the OHC's recommendations within a limited time frame. B. Further participation in the program may be required dependi ng on an individual's answers to the HQ, and/or type of animal exposure, including but not limited to one or more of the following: 1. The OHC may contact a participant to clarify responses on the RA and/or HQ. 2. The OHC may contact a participant to answer health -related questions or concerns as they pertain to working in an animal research facility. 3. The OHC may recommend participation in a medical surveillance program or a specific prevention program (e.g., offering vaccination against vaccine -preventable zoonotic diseases). 4. The OHC may require participation in a mandatory medical surveillance/screening or prevention program for work with specific species and/or hazards (e.g., nonhuman primates, bats, Mycobacterium tuberculosis -TB). University of California, Berkeley - Animal Care and Use Program Animal Care and Use Committee Page 9 of 9 Last Revised: 2/8/2023 5. In addition, completion of any training requirements as established by ACUC, Office for Laboratory Animal Care (OLAC), Environment, Health & Safety (EH&S) or other relevant compliance bodies may be required before an individual can gain access to the animal f acility and/or begin working with any animals. C. Ongoing Assessment 1. The need for additional reviews, evaluations, and services will be determined by the Occupational Health Services medical professional in conjunction with the departmental requirements, based on risk and health history and may range from 1- 3 years (see Risk Categories for detail). 2. Annual reminders are sent to both the supervisor and each individual enrolled to do this. Individuals working with Risk Category B species (e.g., rodents, wild animals and fieldwork) are strongly encouraged to review their risk assessments and health questionnaire for changes but annual participation in the OHSS is not required. 3. The Principal Investigator/Supervisor is responsible for updating the risk assessment in a timely manner if there are changes in work assignments (i.e., change in species, contact levels, and location) for individuals. 4. Individuals listed on Animal Care and Use Protocols are res ponsible for updating their personal health records. 5. A new risk assessment must be created when there is a change in PI or supervisor, to ensure the automated renewal notifications are sent to the correct individual. 6. At the very minimum, all individuals on an AUP at the time of deNovo/Continuing Review must have active (i.e. current) clearance in the OHSS, if not then a RA must be submitted and the subsequent process followed as outlined in A. above.
