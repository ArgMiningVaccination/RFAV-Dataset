They are indigenous people living in remote valleys of the Hi ndu Kush Mountains in northern Pakistan, neighboring Afghanistan. The Kalash a are pastoral, as well as agricultural people to some extent, although they are incre asingly facing pressures from globalization and social change, which may be influenci ng youth and community development. Their traditional world view dichotomizes an d emphasizes on the division of the pure ( Onjeshta ) and the impure ( Pragata). There remains a scarcity of literature on mental health and resilience of indigenous communities i n South Asia and Pakistan generally, and the polytheistic Kalasha community specic ally.

Keywords: indigenous, resilience, ethnic minority, mountai n people, marginalized, mental health, South Asia, Pakistan INTRODUCTION The Kalasha are an indigenous marginalized group settled in the northern mountains of eastern Afghanistan and North- West Pakistan. They are a pagan tribe that practice their own tradition and culture ( 3). Their religious beliefs are polytheistic and animistic. Some of the Kalasha believe that their roots a re in Greece and they are the descendants of Alexander the Great and his army. However, the archaeological research through excavationandexplorationinChitralrevealedthatKalasha were present in Chitral even before the arrival of Alexander the Gr eat inthisregion( 4,5).Historically,Kalashasettlementswerespread overtheChitraldistrictinPakistanandNuristaninAfghan istan, but now they have been shrunken and limited only to three smallvalleysofChitral,Pakistan( 6-8).TheKalashabelongtoan oral tradition, without having any written scripture about t heir religion and culture ( 9). The Kalashamon (\"Kalasha language\"), is one of the many threatened and near extinction languages o f the world ( 10,11). In the recent years, however, the linguistic community has started making some eorts to save the Kalasha languagethroughdocumentingthetext( 12). TheKalashaworld,ortheir\"fundamentaldichotomisationo f the natural environment\" ( 13), is divided into two spheres of \u00f3njes.t.a (pure) and pr\u00e1gat .a (impure). The \u00f3n jes.t.a (pure) spheres include the heights, the mountains, gods, wildlife and goat stables, mountain spirits, fairies and the space between the b ack wall of the houses and the re space in the middle ( 14). The pr\u00e1gat.a,ontheotherhand,representstheplacesatthebottomof thevalleysthatincludesthegraveyardandBashali(aplacew here women stay during menstruation and during childbirth) ( 14- 17). \u00d3njes.t.a also includes animals. For example, goats (as they grazeathighaltitudeinmountains)arepure,whilethechick ens and the eggs are considered pr\u00e1gat .a (impure). The neighboring non-Kalasha communities are thus settled in the lower portio n of the valleys and come under pr\u00e1gat .a spheres. The Kalasha community, therefore, settled in an intermediate space betw een thedichotomyofpr\u00e1gat .aand\u00f3njes.t.a(14,17). The positive connotation in \u00f3n jes.t.a is not related to a blissful life in the hereafter. Also, although pr\u00e1gat .a doesn't have a positive connotation, it has nothing to do with sin or the devi l (5). Additionally, there is no association of these two poles with sexual morals, cleanliness or devotion, like the rest o f the majorityofthePakistancommunity'sviewof\"pure/impure\"( 18). Nowadays,theKalashahavestartedtalkingabouthellandhe aven and often relate this to the myth of Adam and Eve owing to the influence of Islam ( 5,19). However, the traditional Kalasha vision, rooted in their religious system, has limited conce rn forthe hereafter or the idea of a prize or a punishment in the life afterdeath( 5). The Kalasha are an agro-pastoral community ( 20). Their economy is based on pasture and agriculture historically (21). However, their agriculture is very small scaled and the pastoral economy has been endangered because of the symbolic signicance of the pastures in their cultural traditions ( 20, 21). For example, goats are culturally important, intrinsicall y sacred, and pure animals amongst the Kalasha because of their association with wild animals of the mountain region ( 20). Even on festival dances, playing of goats and clashing of their horn s duringcombatsisenacted.Goatsareslaughteredandtheirb lood is believed to provide protection against evil forces ( 22,23). Contrary to the role of cattle and sheep in pastoral subsistenc e, the obsession of the Kalasha with goats can be seen in multiple ways (13). Goats' symbolism can be seen in entire Kalasha religiousculturesuchasgoatcarvingsondoors;pillarsofh ouses; altars, and images on walls of clan temples ( 24). The images of goats are also molded in dough or imprinted on bread at importantrituals( 25). The Kalasha are surrounded by a conflict driven Afghanistan where an extreme and hard-line religious narrative has been built since the 1980s and the narrative kept on spreading to the neighboring places including parts of Pakistan ( 26). The same narrativeforcedthewholeKalashacommunityrestrictedto three valleys,however,oncetheyweresettledintheNuristandistr ictof Afghanistan in the past. The counter-narrative needs to be bu ilt verytimelyinordertopreservethediminishingculturalher itage ofKalasha. The Kalasha are a vulnerable and endangered community consideringtheirchallenginggeographicallocation,ands ecurity threats and their youth are constantly striving to preserve th eir unique culture ( 3). Therefore, in order to gain an in-depth understandingofanindividual'sprotectivefactors,there isaneed to understand the cultural conceptualization of resilience and the role of ecological processes in development of an individu al (27). There is a need to look deeper into the ecological system owing to the influence of the environment of an individual on his/her development ( 27,28). According to Bronfenbrenner's ecological system model, an individual is surrounded by laye r of contexts under influence of multidirectional factors (e. g., family, environment, and context) ( 1).The predominant focus is on the multidirectional interplay of environment, contex t, and ecological system of an individual ( 29). According to Bronfenbrenner,thereareveinterlinkedlevelsintheeco logical environment of a person: microsystem (i.e., family and school etc.); mesosystem (interaction between two systems); exosy stem Frontiers in Public Health | www.frontiersin.org 2 July 2018 | Volume 6 | Article 187Choudhry et al. Mental Health Conceptualization of Kalasha Youth (system that has an indirect influence on a person, e.g., parent 's workplace); macrosystem (community level norms, beliefs an d culture); and chronosystem (the chronological component) ( 2). Furthermore, Putnam ( 30) highlighted the concept of social capitalwhichincludescommunitynetworks,senseofbelongi ng, civic engagement, and trust in community are among the importantfactorscontributingtosocialcapital. Most of the research studies on mental health and resilience have been conducted in high-resourced developed countries (27,31,32). Furthermore, very limited research is conducted in low-resourcedcountriestounderstandtheresponsesofmino rity groups regarding mental health issues ( 31). More indigenous resources, interventions, and methods can be developed if researchers explore the cultural, contextual, bioecolog ical protective factors and contextually and culturally sensiti ve intervention models ( 31). Therefore, the current study was conducted with the objective of understanding the educated young Kalasha's mental health conceptualization, treatmen t preference and their indigenized cultural protective factor s againstmentalhealthissues. METHODS Study Design and Authors The study was conducted using the overarching framework of Bronfenbrenner's ecological system ( 29). The rst author was a non-Kalasha researcher who had worked with the marginalize d communitiesofPakistanforthepast6years,andhadknowledg e of the local dynamics and culture of indigenous communities of Pakistan. The rst author has been trained as a psychological researcher and served in multiple sectors (public, private, and non-government developmental segments). The rst author ha s vast experience using qualitative research, more specicall y, he has 7 years of experience with Interpretative Phenomenologic al Analysis(IPA).Therstauthoralongwiththreelocalresea rchers visitedtheKalashvalleysfordatacollection. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis a qualitative analysis approach which specically explores people's sense making of their experiences with predominantly psychological interest ( 33). In IPA, the researcher carries out in-depth, extensive, rst-person interviews of research participants. The researcher believed in decolonizing resea rch methodologies, therefore, he took an initiative to foster l ocal community connections, for participatory research with the indigenous Kalasha community. The co-authors of the curren t studyarealsoexperiencedresearcherswithampleunderstandi ng ofindigenousandqualitativemethodologies. For the current study, we adhered to the principles and guidelines of IPA ( 33). As IPA is an inductive approach, we framed our research question ensuring flexibility. We tried to maintain quality, trustworthy data collection, analysis , and writing up of this research project by implementing principles of IPA. The team members had regular discussions and team membersexplicitlymonitoredtheresearchprocesstoensuret hat the principles of IPA were followed. Participants were recruit ed from the three valleys of Kalasha through snowball sampling. TwelveKalashapeoplewereinterviewedforthisIPAstudy.Research Paradigm/Epistemology TheepistemologyofIPAisexperientialandhermeneutic.InIP A, the interest is to understand an individual's connection to the world (and to the things in it which matter to him/her) through that individual's meaning-making ( 34). The assumptions of IPA are: developing an understanding of the world necessitates a n understanding of the experiences; and the IPA researchers ar e involved in the personal narratives of the individuals who ar e \"always-already\" engrossed in a linguistic, cultural and phy sical world (34). Therefore, we took an idiographic approach to our researchproject,forenablinganin-depthfocusontheparticu lar individuals of the Kalasha sample. In IPA, the researchers do not directly access experiences from narratives, rather a pro cess of intersubjective meaning-making helps them in accessing a phenomenon.Forimmersinginparticipants'experience,theIPA researchers need to be able to recognize and reflect upon their ownexperiencesandassumptions. Participants The research participants we recruited formed a homogenous sample of the Kalasha youth, struggling for preservation of thei r unique culture, hence, the research question of understand ing their resilience was meaningful. As the mode of enquiry in IPA is idiographic and inductive, a closely-dened group of participantsrepresentsacertaingrouporperspectiveintheare a of study rather than a population is needed. The recruitment of a homogenous sample of participants assisted in providing insights into the similarity and variability of people represe nting that perspective. Recruitment and selection of the research participants was carried out through the snowball sampling method, as after the rst few interviews we requested the participants to refer to their friends (who represent Kalasha youth) for participation in this study. The sample consisted of young Kalasha; from Bhamburat and Birir valleys. All participants were adolescents and emerging adults; identied themselvesasKalasha(5men,7women);werebornandhadlive d in Kalasha and, were fluent in the Urdu language-commonly spokeninKalashavalleys.Mostoftheparticipantswereenrolled to undergrad degree and/or post-graduate level. Majority of t he participants were students, however, one participant was a part timestudentandalsoworkedintheeldsandanotherwasapart - time student. The Kalasha do understand and speak Urdu ( 35, 36), therefore, interviews were conducted in the Urdu language . A detailed analysis of a total of 12 in-depth interviews of 12 participants was carried out. The participants' age ranged from 18 to 26 years thus they are considered the youth of Kalasha community. Data Collection The data were collected in the form of in-depth semi- structured interviews. The time duration of these intervie ws varied from 55 to 140min. On average, each interview took 97min. The rst author interviewed all the participants and other researchers helped in handling recording devices and taking eld notes. This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the ethics guidelin es of the Monash University Human Research Ethics Committee Frontiers in Public Health | www.frontiersin.org 3 July 2018 | Volume 6 | Article 187Choudhry et al. Mental Health Conceptualization of Kalasha Youth (MUHREC) and the ethics committee of the Punjab Institute of Mental Health (PIMH). The protocol was approved by the MUHREC(MUHREC;CF15/4575-2015001970)andtheEthics Committee, PIMH. All subjects gave written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All participa nts were informed that they were free to stop the interview or withdraw their data, should they wish. We used the interview scheduleflexiblyaccordingtoIPAgoodpractice( 33). Procedure Semi-structured interviews were carried out in the Urdu language in order to collect the data. The research participan ts were asked to talk about their experiences of mental health and protective factors against mental health problems. An interview schedule guided the researchers, but the participa nts were allowed to talk freely about their own experiences. The researcher spontaneously asked questions in response to the participants' accounts. All the interviews were carried out a t participants' homes on a one-to-one basis. The arrangements were done to conduct the interviews in a separate room of the participants' houses in order to ensure condentiality of the responses.Theinterviewerprobedtheimportantandinteresti ng issues brought forth by the participants themselves. All the interviewswereaudio-recordedontwoseparateaudio-recor ders. The recordings of all the interviews were transcribed verba tim and then translated into English. The eld notes were taken during the interviews by the accompanying researchers. All t he data was anonymized to ensure condentiality. The translat ed interviews were checked by two language experts who had commandoverbothlanguages(i.e.,UrduandEnglish). Data Analysis Inordertocarryouttheanalysis,wefollowedtheIPAprocedu res outlinedbySmithetal.( 33).IPAiscommittedtotheidiographic approach\u2014a process of analysis which begins with a detailed assessmentofeachcasefollowedbyasearchforsimilarrespo nses across cases ( 37). Both convergence and divergence is carried out in the analysis by reading the transcripts line-by-line. The analysis proceeds by assessing the points of descriptive, linguistic, and conceptual notes throughout. The initial st ep of IPA comprises developing an open mind and an exploratory attitudeforproducingacomprehensiveandin-depthaccountof thedata(33,38).Intheothermargin,theresearchertransformed theinitialnotesintoemergentexperientialthemes.Inares onant and concise way, the themes set out to grasp the main aspects of eachparticipants'experienceframedbytheinterpretationsof the analyst. Using techniques of abstraction and subsumption ( 33) within case and across the participants, themes were grouped and superordinate themes were produced. After producing a list of superordinate themes and contributory subthemes wit h reference pointers to the supporting evidence in the interview transcript for the rst case, the process was repeated for every case. In the end, the 12 individual tables were reviewed at the same time, major common themes, and points of strong convergenceanddivergencewerehighlighted. The superordinate themes were then transformed into a narrative account with analysis supported by verbatim extrac ts from every participant. The main author took the lead on theinitial analytic steps and at each stage the data was audited by co-authors. Through this rigorous search, any kind of the influence of assumptions on the analysis was minimized. This auditingledtominormodications.Inthelaterstagesofan alysis, writing was done in a collaborative way and ideas were shared , challenged and modied. All the co-authors contributed to t he writing up and gave signicant comments on interpretations. Thismethodisconsistentwiththegoodpracticeinhermeneut ic phenomenology and helps to guarantee rigor.

RESULTS The IPA was conducted to extract themes from the data. We have extracted a total of 3 superordinate themes, each with emergent themes: (1) Psychological Resilience/Cultur al Protective Factors Buering Against Mental Health Problems (Intra-communal Bonding & Sharing; Kalasha Festivals & Traditions; Purity Concept; Behavioral Practice of Happiness and Cognitive Patterns); (2) Perceived Causes of Mental Health Issues (Biological & Psychosocial; Supernatural & Spiritual; Environmental); and (3) Preferred Intervention s [Shamanic Treatment; Ta'awiz Communal Sharing & Problem Solving; Medical Treatment; Herbal Methods]. Each major category of theme or superordinate theme with emergent subthemes is discussed in the following section. Psychological Resilience/Cultural Protective Factors Buffering Against Mental Health Problems TheKalashayouthdiscussedcertainfactorsthattheyconsid ered as their cultural protective factors against mental health issues. Here, it is noteworthy that the term \"mental health problems\" is generally a broad term and used intentionally in order to understand Kalasha youth's understanding of \"mental health.\" Therefore, in this result section, when we use the term psychological resilience or cultural protective factors buering against mental health problems, it refers to neurotic as well as psychotic domains of the problem. However, we have observed a pattern in every interview where a participant started sharing his/her views regarding protective factors and initially conceptualized \"mental heal th\" as psychotic phenomenon and then with the passing conversation and probing from the interviewer, the participant also shared his/her views of resilience factors against \"less severe\" m ental health issues, and/or the symptoms of common mental disorders, like disturbed sleep, decreased appetite, irritabi lity, andsadness. Intra-Communal Bonding and Sharing The intra-communal bonding and sharing culture among Kalasha youth was the most frequently discussed factor that contributestotheirwell-beingandservesasaculturalprot ective Frontiers in Public Health | www.frontiersin.org 4 July 2018 | Volume 6 | Article 187Choudhry et al.

It is pertinent to note that in the very rst theme of cultural protectivefactors,theyoungKalashaparticipantsreflectedu pon their shared value of unity and membership of their traditio nal culture. They do not only own their culture with pride, but als o consider their communal bonding and culture of generosity a s important factors that make them resilient.

This shows that young Kalasha tend to have high cohesiveness and congenial interpersonal relationships. This theme of int ra- communal bonding and sharing reflects the microsystemic approach, if we look at the participants' quotes in the context of Bronfenbrenner's systems. Also, the above quotes refer t o the mesosystemic interactions between Kalasha youth and th e neighboring communities and we can ascertain the intimate kinshippatterns,yetautonomouspracticesofKalashafamily . Kalasha Festivals and Traditions The Kalasha celebrate three major and a few small festivals i n a year (41). Every member of the community takes part in these festivals regardless of gender or age. These festival s are mostly considered a way of paying tribute to the nature and gods. They are meant for the well-being of the community and also hold very signicant value in Kalasha culture and tradi tion. The signicance of Kalasha festivals are depicted through th e followingverbatimquotesoftheparticipants:\"There are 3 major festivals in Kalasha, one is celebrated in December during winters, another is celebrated in Spring in May , that is called 'Chillamjosh', and the third one is celebrated in October, mostly in Autumn. There are many other small festivals, but mainly these three are the major celebrations. So in festival s we do get together and dance together and pay tribute to nature, celebrationsmakesushappyandresilient.\" \"Traditionalcelebrationsareinordertorememberwhoweareasa people,likethegatheringsshowabonding.Sothe'festivals' thatthey call it in the print media, are actually not some kind of a drinking parties, or dancing shows.

Especially the May festival 'Chilamjosh.' \"When festival starts on 3rd May, people with new born babies get together at a place called Jazda Khana, then all mothers place flowers there and an ancient shawl is also tied there, and they also carrie baskets full of walnuts and mulberry. Then they move upwards from Jazda Khana, and from there one man pours milk onnewbornbabies,peoplehavedierentconceptsaboutthis ritual, some says that it's for prosperity and some says that after this babies do not weep much.

Rather these festivals are well planned and organized events with an objectiveandareacelebrationofnewseasons. Purity Concept The \u00f3njes.t.a and pr\u00e1gat .a are a symbolic system of the Kalasha. In past literature, these terms are used in place of \"pure\" and \"impure.\" This polarity has semantic meanings which were illuminatedbytheparticipantsinthegivenbelowkeyquotes: \"The division of pure and impure instils hope for us to go about \u00f3njes.t.a (pure) more, to be connected with our ancestors and with ourinnerselfwhichhelpsusbecomestronger.\" \"Bashali is a place separated from our houses, located at the down side,forwomentostayduringmenstruationandchildbirthperiod.

The research participants used thi s concept to explain how women during their menstruation shift Frontiers in Public Health | www.frontiersin.org 5 July 2018 | Volume 6 | Article 187Choudhry et al. Mental Health Conceptualization of Kalasha Youth to Bashali and the women considered and accepted this practice as something that gives them an opportunity to rest and have time for contemplation. The participants also believed that th e division of \u00f3n jes.t.a and pr\u00e1gat .a gave them strength as it provides themopportunitiestoconnectwithone'sinnerselfandwithth eir ancestor's spirits. This reflects their philosophical inclina tions toward existential domain that they believe in a spiritual wo rld andhaveanunderstandingofconnectingwithinnerself. Behavioral Practices of Happiness and Cognitive Patterns From the social constructivism perspective, every individua l constructsauniquerealitydependingonhis/herphenomenolo gy and lived experiences. Here, in illuminating on the concept of happiness, Kalasha youngsters, as a whole group seem to hold similar beliefs about the shared value of happiness. The young Kalasha's cognitive schemas tend to be based upon cultural upbringing and predisposition to the concept of celebrations and happiness. The schematic practice of happiness ismanifestedthroughbehavioralcomponentsaswell.Thisca nbe comprehendedbytheexplanationofthementionedquote,where theparticipantexplainedhowtheKalashayoutharepersistenti n practicesofhappinessduringtimesofgrief. The gure-ground relationship of happiness can be best explained through the example of their death ritual, where the concept of happiness per semay become ground and the sorrow isthefocusorgure,however;inallothersocialinteracti onsand actions, the concept of happiness is a central element. Savorin g refers to attending to and enhancing positive experiences and is the use of thoughts and actions to increase the intensity and duration of positive experiences ( 42). The young Kalasha's formulationofhappinessseemswellversedwithsavoringasth eir positive focus on happiness, through the cognitive element and physical actions of participation in festivities and celebrat ions. The savoring of Kalasha youth through behavioral and cognit ive patterns again reflects the Bronfenbrenner's macrosystem as this disposition of happiness is inherited and enrooted in thei r tradition and culture, attitudes and belief system. The you ng Kalasha give utmost importance to their macrosystem as well as microsystems. Some examples of these behavioral practices in participants'wordsaregivenasfollows: \"Our festivals and preparations for festivals make us happy, we do dance, chant and sing with instruments i.e., drum play. It's all happinessanditisthepracticeofhappiness.\" \"Youcansaythatwearehappybecauseweshareourgriefandhere peoplesupporteachotherandbelieveinlivinghappily.\" \"Let's take an example of the death ritual here.

Perceived Causes of Mental Health Issues Biological and Psychosocial Causes TheKalashayoungstersseemtohaveanadequateunderstandi ng of the etiological factors of stress as well as the genetic vulnerabilityforpsychologicalproblems.Thestressvulnera bility model (43) seems to be applicable here which identies stress andbiologicalvulnerabilityastwoimportantfactorscontri buting to mental health problems and the Kalasha youth also reflected upon these two. Furthermore, one participant shared the psychosocialelementofmentalhealthproblemswithanexample of a girl who converted to Islam. The argument that the participant wanted to build reflects the socio-political pressur e fromtheneighboringcommunities. \"YesIknowthemajorcauseofmentalhealthissuesis'stress'let me sharewithyouanexampleofayoungKalashagirlwhoconvertedto Islamlastyear.Shewasnotmatureandwasundertheageof18,so shewenttolivewithaMuslimfamily.Herparentsdidmanyeorts to bring her back home but failed.

Resultantly not only that girl but her cousin who broughtherbackwasalsotraumatizedandnowhavepanicattacks veryoften.\" Where we discussed earlier about the importance and congenial microsystem organizations of Kalasha, this theme illumina te another side. This shows that Kalasha youth have to face challenging scenarios in their mesosystem, especially when t heir microsystems of Kalasha family and neighboring communitie s interact. Environmental If we see participants' quotes (as given below) with respect to the environmental causes of mental health problems and also relate these quotes with what the participants discussed earl ier i.e., stress and biological vulnerability, it will be just to co nclude thattheKalashayouthholdabeliefsimilartothediathesis- stress model.

Shamanic Treatment The Kalasha a strong belief in their traditi onal spiritualpracticesforcuringhealthrelatedproblems.Weter med this theme as shamanic treatment, although the past literatu re recommends that it is more appropriate to say that shamanic elements are present in Kalasha culture rather than calling it a full-fledged shamanic institution ( 5). The practices of treatment are similar to shamanic treatment where the Kalas ha de'har/shamangoesintoatranceandfocuseshis/hergazeon the \u00f3njes.t.a sphere and provides the remedy after assessment. The \"istongus\", as reported by the participants is sacricing a goa t and distributing its meat after sprinkling the goat blood on t he patient'sforehead.Theconcepthereisthecharity/sacrice which is somewhat similar to the traditions found in other religio ns, especially Abrahamic traditions.

The spiritual options are chosen considering their easy access , respectingthebeliefsand,followingtheadviceoftheireld ersand ancestors. The shamanic treatment reflects the Bronfenbren microsystem, if we consider experts as a microsystem organization. Ta'awiz (Amulets) The Kalasha have been living in a close proximity with the Muslim community. In the recent decades, the Muslim populationhassettledcloselytothemainentranceoftheKalas h valleys. The Muslim preachers come all the way from Punjab andKhyberPakhtunkhwaprovincesforpreachingpurposesand try to convert Kalasha. The conversion of Kalasha is also an issue reported; whereas some participants believe it is a force d conversion, others think that they convert with their free w ill and without any pressure. Here, the focus is not to explore thei r conversion process but understanding their perspective in ter ms ofconsultingMuslimclerics(Molvis)forseekingcureofphysic al ormentalhealthproblems.TheKalashaparticipantssharedthe ir viewsinthefollowingstatements: \"People believe in amulets for cure of mental health, but our generation does not believe in them. For example, I know someon e whohasepilepsy andisseekingtreatmentwithamuletsinorderto treat epilepsy! They do not consult the doctor. If anyone faces any mental health issue, they use amulets only and get those amulets from Muslims. Kalasha can get health.

The Kalasha youth seem to have been influenced by the ritual of getting amulets fromMuslimMolvies.Thisphenomenonisanemergingtrendin Frontiers in Public Health | www.frontiersin.org 7 July 2018 | Volume 6 | Article 187Choudhry et al. Mental Health Conceptualization of Kalasha Youth Kalasha,whichwasnotpresentintheirtraditionalpractices .This phenomenon emerged with the conversions as the converted Kalashas have faith in the healing powers of Quranic verses an d they share with other non-converted Kalasha. This has been evident largely in more remote valleys of Barir and Rambur as compared to Bamburat valley. The valleys of Barir and Rambur are in a constant process of acculturation, whereas, Bambura t valley's Kalasha people seem to be resistant to the process of th is changeandwanttoconservetheirculturalheritage. Communal Sharing and Problem Solving The homogenous structure of the Kalasha community portrays Kalasha as one community. It is a small community spread over three rural valleys (i.e., Barir, Rambur, and Bamburat). Ea ch valleyislocatedatadistanceandapproachtothesevalleysis not very easy as no proper roads are constructed and one has to put thevehiclesonthemountaintracksinordertoreacheveryva lley. The distance between Bamburat valley and the Rambur valley is 1,640 m. There is a pass connecting the Birir and Bamburat valleys at around 3,000m. The Kalash towns in each of the thre e valleysaresituatedataheightofaround1,900-2,200m( 44,45). Besides the diculty, all the three valleys of Kalasha are connectedtooneanotherduringtimesofhappinessandsorrow. They have a culture of sharing and caring. This empathetic culture was fostered through their tradition and their ance stor's emphasis on sharing and mutual respect. It wouldn't be wrong to say that each young Kalasha has inherited the positive trai ts of mutual respect, sharing and generosity. The example of the deathritualinthefollowingquotereflectshowtheyoungKal asha contribute nancially and emotionally in order to retain th eir traditionsandrituals. \"Inordertounderstandthecultureofsharing,let'stakeanexample of the ritual of death, which is very costly here, because when someone dies, people from all the Kalasha valleys come here. The mourning family has to slaughter 30 to 50 goats as a death ritual and to feed all the community gathered for funeral ceremony. The goats are very costly and also they have to arrange a large quantity of cheese in addition to goats, it is again challenging. So ifthatfamilydoesn'thavegoatsormoneytopurchasegoats,peo ple actually help that family to manage the expenses in this dicult time,everymemberofKalashaoershelp;theygiveanddoalotof charity and it is on a volunteer basis with no obligation, it's to tally up to the person helping to contribute whatever he/she can.

This culture of sharing is not limite d to deathritualsonly,butwepracticethesameforanyotherproblem.\" Once again, we see the relevance of the Bronfenbrenner's macrosystemasabeliefsystemholdingthevaluesofsharing and caringreflectsthemacrosystem. Medical Treatment The Kalasha youngsters have explained about the medical treatmentoptionsinthefollowingquotes: \"Kalashagoestohospitalsforthetreatmentofmentalhealthissue s, mostlytheygotoChitral.Agirlhadsomementalhealthproblems, she was taken to the hospital; there she stayed for two months butshe is still in the same condition.

But sometimes people do not get cure from doctors even. I request for the government to appoint good doctors and better facilities in our hospital like MRI, ECT and other medical treatmentsetc.tostopthiscultureofamulets.\" Kalasha youth have an understanding of the medical causes of mental health problems and they realize that the medical treatments should be considered but they are left with other treatment options due to various limitations and barriers in accessingthemedicalfacilitiesespeciallythepsychiatricfa cilities which are available only in main cities. Also, there is awaren ess that consulting faith healers and using amulets are not very eectiveoptionsasoneparticipantappealedandhighlightedthe needtoappointspecializeddoctorsandequipmentintheirlocal hospital in order to stop the trend of consulting faith healers . The medical option, in some cases, is the last remedy when the condition of the patient doesn't improve from other options. This is because the medical option is a bit dicult to approach considering the peculiar geographical location of the Kalash a valleys. Herbal Methods The Kalasha youngsters tend to believe that organic food can be a good protective factor against physical and mental health problems.TheKalashayouthalsoilluminatedaboutusingherba l methodsasshowninthefollowingexcerpt: \"There are medicinal plants in Kalasha valleys, which can cure problems related to physical and mental health.

DISCUSSION The aim of the current study was to understand young Kalasha' s lived experience and sense making of mental health and psychological resilience. The aim was also to explore young Kalasha's cultural protective factors against mental healt h issues and to make sense of Kalasha's world and their perceived cause s of mental health problems and their help seeking behavior/ Frontiers in Public Health | www.frontiersin.org 8 July 2018 | Volume 6 | Article 187Choudhry et al. Mental Health Conceptualization of Kalasha Youth preferred treatment options. The themes discussed in the resu lts sectionshedlightonKalasha'sperspectives. The relationships within any society or group of people are denedbysocialcapital.Themostwidelyuseddenitionofso cial capital in health sciences is given by Putnam ( 30). According to Putnam, there are ve main aspects of the social capital: (1) community networks, voluntary, state, personal network s, and density; (2) civic engagement, participation, and use of civic networks; (3) local civic identity\u2014sense of belongin g, solidarity, and equality with other members; (4) reciprocit y and norms of cooperation, a sense of obligation to help others, an d condence in return of assistance; (5) trust in the communit y (30). According to the theory of social capital, the many components in this concept are a behavioral/activity component (also called structural social capital, e.g., participation) and a cognitive/perceptual component (also called cognitive soci al capital,e.g.,trust)( 46). Kalasha's structural and cognitive social capital are reflec ted from the themes of intra-communal bonding and correspond to connections among individuals who resemble each other such as individuals in Kalasha community or individuals of the same socioeconomic status (also known as bonding social capital). The evidence of a relationship between social capit al and mental health was shown in a systematic review. This reveals the presence of a negative relationship between the individual level cognitive social capital and common mental disorders ( 47). Furthermore, the past research ( 48) has shown betterhealthoutcomesinthecommunitieswherethereishig her involvement of people in community activities as compared to those communities where there is lower civic engagement. Kalasha surely seem to have high involvement in community activities as also evident from the themes of Intra-communa l bondingandsharing,andKalashafestivalsandtraditions. Theresearchalsoshowedapositivecorrelationbetweensoci al participation (such as cultural festivals) and wellbeing. Pa st empirical evidence suggests: community festivals are assoc iated with opportunities for community cultural development ( 49); festivals are building blocks for communities and encourag e ethnic understanding within society ( 49-51), festivals safeguard and celebrate local traditions, history, and culture, or ca n be used as an approach to spread a destination's lifecycle (52). Engagement, a measure of a person's purpose in life, is a chief element in positive psychology. Research has linked engagement with various health outcomes, both physical and psychological ( 53). Seligman emphasized the signicance of well-being, and gave forth ve quantiable measures to reflect this construct; referred by the acronym PERMA: PositiveEmotion,Engagement,PositiveRelationships,Meani ng, and Accomplishment ( 53). According to Seligman, higher engagement is associated with improved well-being and a meaningfullife( 53). There is a role of festivals in improving mentalhealthandwellbeingattheindividual,organization al,and communitylevel,however,thereislimitedresearchinvest igating thelinkbetweencommunityfestivalsandwellbeing.Thefes tivals are shown to bring about meaningful and fullling social interactions benecial for health and wellbeing at the indi vidualas well as community level ( 48,54). This is well related with the themeofKalashafestivalsandtraditionsandBehavioralpra ctices of happiness and cognitive patterns, where they discussed in detailhowgoodtheyfeelplanningandcelebratingthesefesti vals andhowitbecomesasourceofhappinessforthemandservesas aprotectivefactoragainstpsychologicalproblems. Also, referring to Kalasha's concept of purity, the positive meaning of the term \u00f3n jes.t.a doesn't mean that pr\u00e1gat .a is associated with sin or the devil ( 5,55). Also, like our understanding of the \"pure/impure\", these two poles of \u00f3n jes.t.a and pr\u00e1gat .a are not related to sexual morals, cleanliness or devotion ( 5,18). Nowadays, as a result of living with Muslims and influence of Islam, Kalasha people talk about paradise and hellandoccasionallyrelatethemythofAdamandEve.However , the true Kalasha tradition has no concept of after life, idea o f a prize or a punishment in the hereafter\u2014a view found also in the Veda(5,56)andinearlyRome( 5,56). In case of violating the rituals, apology is sought ritually a nd reward for praiseworthy acts is granted here on Earth, with th e respect they give and the endless memory posterity will keep of the person who performed them. The idea of immortality does not seem to be linked to something that survives death, like the Christian/Islamic soul, and it is not related to ano ther world. However, it has to do with being remembered in this world. According to the Kalasha, remembrance is kept alive through the songs and panegyrics rejoicing the feats of the ancestors, continually carried out at every festival, and t hrough the wooden statues (egies) engraved for those who in their lives have achieved commendable deeds ( 5). In discussing the Kalasha's concept of purity in light of literature, we cannot move beyond the ground breaking research of Kohlberg, where morality was conceptualized in terms of harm and justice, which included values relating to individual rights, fairne ss, and personal autonomy ( 57). Nevertheless, moral judgments can encompass other domains besides harm and justice such as loyalty to group, respecting authority, and, conserving puri ty and sacredness. Kalasha forms the best example of conformity, respecting authority, loyalty to their ethnic group and Kala sha's eorts for conserving purity and sacredness are evident from theirconceptof\u00f3n jes.t.aandpr\u00e1gat .a. Lastly, the domain of purity comprises values and principles oriented at safeguarding the sacredness of the body and soul . It is the belief in the purity domain that people ought to be, in their bodies and minds, clean, chaste, self-controlled, a nd spiritually pure and should endeavor to lead life in a sacred, divine way (the belief in deity is not a necessary requiremen t). Fromthestanceofpurity,torejectpollutingforcesorhedoni stic pleasure, to purify the soul, and to behave according to the \"natural order\" is righteous. It is immoral to act in a way tha t is of happiness and cognitive patterns by relating it with the \"savoring\" concept of positive psychology. It is believed that savoring, as the set of cognitive or behavioral strategies, is a monitoring process impacting the association between positive events and a person's positive aective responses to these Frontiers in Public Health | www.frontiersin.org 9 July 2018 | Volume 6 | Article 187Choudhry et al. Mental Health Conceptualization of Kalasha Youth incidents ( 61,62). Savoring is dened as a mechanism whereby individuals engage \"to attend to, appreciate, and enhance the positiveexperiencesintheirlives\"( 42). According to Bryant and Vero, there are many cognitive and behavioral strategies of savoring that are involved in enhancingandextendingpositiveexperiences,includingsha ring the event with others, behavioral expression, counting bles sings, self-congratulation, memory building, and sensory-percept ual sharpening ( 42). Another concept resembling savoring is view of \"capitalizing\" given by Langston ( 63). Capitalizing is dened asconstructivelyunderstandingpositiveincidents( 63).Thepast empirical evidence has shown the eectiveness of savoring as a mechanism of positive aective regulation that maintains and deepens positive emotions ( 42,64,65). There is a mediating and/or moderating role of savoring in the relationship betw een positive events and happiness ( 42). Now as we have explained andrelatedthendingsofpsychologicalresilienceofthecu rrent study with the past literature, in next section we will discuss the secondmajorcomponentofthecurrentstudyi.e.,mentalheal th conceptualizationofKalasha. The rst theme in the perceived mental health causes of Kalashawas Biologicalandpsychosocialcauses. Thepastempirical studies have suggested three models regarding the causes an d treatment of mental health; the supernatural, biological and psychosocial models. The people in developed countries have more inclination toward and accept biological and genetic aetiologies of mental health issues ( 66-68). But surprisingly the minority community of Kalasha from a developing country seems to have an adequate understanding of biological and psychosocial causes of illness. The biological model sugges ting chemical imbalance, hereditary and genetic causes of illnes s as well as the psychosocial model linking mental health problems withissuessuchasstress,trauma,abuse,andfamilyandrel ational conflictshavereceivedconsiderableempiricalsupport( 69-74). The literature has highlighted that the people in developing countries have more inclination toward and accept supernatur al forces, evil spirits and spiritual aetiologies of mental heal th issues and choose indigenous treatment modes ( 75-79). Despite the fact that Kalasha do have an understanding of biological and psychosocial causes but they also seems to believe in the supernaturalcausesofmentalhealthproblems.Ameta-synthe sis study revealed the perception of people assigning mental health issuestoblessingsandspiritualconnectionwithGodandget ting special attention from nature ( 80,81). Moreover, the belief on spiritual treatments as the preferred mode of treatment was presentinthepaststudies( 80-83). The supernatural model of mental health issues has received support from a few studies ( 82,83). However, according to a few research studies, traditional healers are shown as provi ders of eective psychosocial intervention; relieving distress a nd improving mild symptoms in common mental issues such as depression and anxiety ( 28,75,80). Nevertheless, there is limited evidence supporting the eectiveness of traditiona l healers in managing severe mental health problems such as bipolar, psychotic disorders, or obsessive-compulsive disor der (28,75). There is a possibility that the traditional healing could bri ng more harms than good. It is likely that individuals with mildissues and positive expectations seek subjective benet from joining their chosen traditional or spiritual healers. Ther e is existence of value in those individuals seeking and nding meaning in attending the traditional healers. The individu als nd the traditional healers benecial despite absence of any betterment in symptoms. There is ambiguity about how these traditional healers work, though exhaustive regular socia l interventions usually attain better results as compared to s hort- termed single interventions. The same concern is also raised by fewofourstudyparticipantswhoseemskepticalofthetraditio nal andsupernaturalmethods. There is a call for a more holistic care and potential synergies for mental health, if an association between healing system s can be enabled for the individuals having cultural and spirit ual beliefs contrary to conventional psychiatry ( 84). Our participant discussed about herbal methods as treatment of health relat ed problems. The herbal medicine\u2014a famous complementary and alternativemedicine(CAM)isusedworldwide( 85)intreatments of a range of health issues which may include common mental health problems ( 86). Lastly, we will discuss how our chosen theoretical framework of Bronfenbrenner's ecosystems can b e applicable in the context of this study for Kalasha. The same has been discussed in the result section with the themes wher e Bronfenbrenner'ssystemseemsapplicable. Interpersonal relationships comprise the microsystem and mesosystem.WhenKalashadiscussedaboutstronginterperso nal relationship, communal bonding and sharing and celebrating their festival, this actually refers to their strong microsy stem and macrosystem. The microsystem recognizes a person's face- to-face interaction with others such as his/her family, sch ool, and peers ( 2,86,87). However, the mesosystem deals with multiplemicrosystemsthatoperatesidebyside( 1);forinstance, a Kalasha celebrating their traditional festival after con sulting with their traditional/religious elders who decides the da te of thefestival. The macrosystem\u2014comprising the overarching worldview of a community and culture\u2014investigated the uniformities wit hin the subculture, existing belief system in the culture, or id eology thathadbeenformulatedfromthelowerordersystems( 87).The macrosystemisthemostrelevantsysteminthecaseofKalash aas their lives are guided by their traditional beliefs and they valued alottotheirancestraltraditionsandpromotingtheircommu nal bonding. This model enlightened the researcher that a person 's ecologicalmechanismsoccurinadynamicmannerwithinterpl ay ofvariousfactors( 27,28). Strengths, Limitations, and Future Directions This study established the usefulness of the Bronfenbrenner 's bioecological model in recognizing various resilience fac tors in a developing individual's environmental context, but the focus on the exosystem and chronosystem was less in Kalasha's context of this study. Only one participant's example illustrat ed in the theme of psychosocial causal factors reflects the relevance of chronosystem where she commented about the societal and geopolitical pressure and environment surround ed by the Kalasha. Additionally, this model oers a baseline of characteristics to acknowledge the developing individua l's Frontiers in Public Health | www.frontiersin.org 10 July 2018 | Volume 6 | Article 187Choudhry et al. Mental Health Conceptualization of Kalasha Youth protective factors. This study explores the intricacies and complexitiesregardingmentalhealthexistingintheenviro nment oftheKalashayouth. The limitation of the study includes the broader scope of the study as this study is one of the rst initiatives to condu ct empiricalstudyonKalashafromthepsychological/mentalhea lth angle, therefore there was no past psychological literature availableonKalasha.Hence,wedecidedtoframethisstudyw ith the broader scope of mental health rather than operationalizi ng the specic variables representing mental health. Secondly, despite the Bronfenbrenner bioecological model's identica tion of protective factors, there is a possibility that any other pos sible resiliencefactormayhaveoverlooked,whichwe (researche rand participants)couldn'tbringinduringtheinterview. Future studies can be planned on Kalasha to explore the relationship between their savoring practices and psycholog ical wellbeing and happiness as well as on their acculturation process. In any future study, it is recommended to include loc al collaborators who belong to the Kalasha community in order t o promotedecolonizingresearch. CONCLUSION The present study provides the contribution to the eld of psychology by identifying cultural protective factors and mental health perceived causes and treatment options used by a community which is struggling for its survival and for conservation of its cultural heritage. The resilience fact ors identied through this study can be used in clinical setting s for devising management plan for fostering resilience and todeal with psychological distress faced by similar indigenous communities in South Asia. The ndings of this study highlig ht Kalasha's lack of access to quality higher level mental heal th care forseverecasesofmentalhealthproblems,andthedisassoci ation between medical and indigenous constructs which jeopardizes eectivecare.
