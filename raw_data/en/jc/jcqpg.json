RWE Offshore US Gulf, LLC was the winner of the Lake Charles Lease Area, which has the potential to generate approximately 1.24 gigawatts of offshore wind energy capacity and power nearly 435,400 homes with clean, renewable energy. Today's auction furthers President Biden's Investing in America agenda, a key pillar of Bidenomics that is growing the American economy from the middle out and bottom up - from rebuilding our nation's infrastructure, to driving over $500 billion in private sector manufacturing and clean energy investments in the United States, to creating good paying jobs and building a clean energy economy that will combat climate change and make our communities more resilient. \"The Biden-Harris administration is making once-in-a-generation investments in America's infrastructure and our clean energy future as we take steps to bring offshore wind energy to additional areas around the country,\" said Secretary Deb Haaland. \"I am proud of the hard work being done by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and across the Interior Department to deliver on our promises to advance a clean energy economy that will lower energy costs for families and create good-paying jobs as we help tackle the climate crisis.\" \"Today's lease sale represents an important milestone for the Gulf of Mexico region \u2014 and for our nation \u2014 to transition to a clean energy future,\" said Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) Director Elizabeth Klein. \"The Lake Charles Lease Area will have the potential to generate enough electricity to power about 435,400 homes and create hundreds of jobs.\" The Biden-Harris administration has [jumpstarted an American offshore wind industry](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/29/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-continues-to-advance-american-offshore-wind-opportunities/) that will strengthen the nation's energy security, make the power grid more reliable while lowering energy costs, and reduce dangerous climate pollution. The Department has approved the nation's first four commercial scale offshore wind projects, held four offshore wind lease auctions - including a record-breaking sale offshore New York and the first-ever sales offshore the Pacific and Gulf Coasts, initiated environmental review of 10 offshore wind projects, and advanced the process to explore additional Wind Energy Areas in Oregon, Gulf of Maine and Central Atlantic. The Department has also taken steps to evolve its approach to offshore wind to drive towards union-built projects and a domestic supply chain. BOEM's lease sale offered two areas offshore Galveston, Texas, one comprising 102,480 acres and the other 96,786 acres, and a third, 102,480-acre area offshore Lake Charles, Louisiana. The two Galveston lease areas offered today did not receive bids. RWE Offshore US Gulf, LLC earned the following bidding credits: These bidding credits will result in over $860,000 in investments for workforce training and a domestic supply chain, and another more than $430,000 for fisheries compensatory mitigation. BOEM is committed to workforce development and safety and to the establishment of a durable domestic supply chain that can sustain the U.S. offshore wind energy industry. As such, BOEM included two lease stipulations, one that encourages project labor agreements and construction efficiency and the other that contributes toward establishing a domestic supply chain. In addition, the lessee is required to engage with Tribes, ocean users and local communities that may be affected by lease activities. The engagement activities must be routinely reported to BOEM. The purpose of such engagement is to promote offshore wind energy development in a way that coexists with other ocean uses, addresses potential impacts and benefits, and protects the ocean environment, while also facilitating our nation's energy future for generations to come.
