Yes. The hepatitis B vaccine is safe to be administered during pregnancy. Please remember that even if a mother receives the hepatitis B vaccine during pregnancy, her baby will have to be vaccinated after birth. The protective antibodies are not transmitted from the mother to her baby. Therefore, all babies should receive the birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine. However, this is particularly critical for babies born to mothers living with chronic hepatitis B. Find more [Frequently Asked Questions "}
