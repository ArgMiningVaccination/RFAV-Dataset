Ayurveda is an ancient system evolved in India over 5000 years ago. Ayur means life and Veda means knowledge. Ayurveda is all about prevention of poor health and encouraging the maintenance of good health. This is achieved by balancing lifestyle, emotion and diet together with the use of Indian herbs. Balancing these factors varies for each individual. Balance can be affected by internal and external influences. For example changes in emotion due to stress, incorrect or poor diets, lack of food choices, seasons, weather, physical injury, training and exercise and relationships with others. Balance is the natural order and invokes good health, imbalance leads to disorder and poor health. Energy is required for cell function, movement and metabolism within the body. Within Ayurveda are three types of energy, Vata, Pitta and Kapha, which are related to different aspects of cell biology. Vata is the energy of cell movement, Pitta is the energy of cell metabolism and Kapha the energy of cell structure. Imbalance is thought to be caused by the excess or deficiency of either of these energies, or by the presence of toxins. Ayurveda is not a substitute for veterinary medicine and does not precede over veterinary advice, however it can be used successfully alongside it. It will help strengthen the individual, assist immunity or help recovery.
