Last updated on Nov 21, 2022. Clinical Overview Use Despite multiple purported effects, controlled clinical trials are lacking. Dosing One gram of root bark given 2 to 3 times daily is a typical dose, while 20 to 30 mg of a root bark extract has been recommended. Clinical trials are generally lacking to support appropriate dosages. A standardized extract containing 8% to 10% carboxy alkyl esters and less than 0.5% oxindole alkaloids has been used in clinical studies in doses of 250 to 300 mg. Contraindications Cat's claw products should be avoided before and after surgery, as well as by those using immunosuppressant therapy and in children due to lack of safety data. Pregnancy/Lactation Information regarding safety and efficacy during pregnancy and lactation is lacking. Interactions See Drug Interactions section. Adverse Reactions Although reports of adverse effects are rare, GI complaints (nausea, diarrhea, stomach discomfort), renal effects, neuropathy, and an increased risk of bleeding with anticoagulant therapy are possible. Toxicology Historical ethnomedicinal evidence and current use by consumers suggest low toxicity; however, toxicological studies are limited. Scientific Family - Rubiaceae Botany Cat's claw is a tropical vine of the madder family (Rubiaceae). The name describes the small, curved-back spines on the stem at the leaf juncture. The genus Uncaria is found mainly in tropical regions of Southeast Asia, the Asian continent, and South America. There are 34 reported species of Uncaria. U. tomentosa and U. guianensis species are found in South America and are lianas, or high-climbing, twining, woody vines growing up to 305 m in length and several centimeters in diameter. Both species are known in Peru as u\u00f1a de gato (Spanish for cat's claw). Large amounts of U. guianensis are collected in South America for the European market, while American sources prefer U. tomentosa. By 1997, over 50 dietary supplement manufacturers offered cat's claw products in the United States. One Asian species, known as gambir or pole catechu (Uncaria gambir [Hunter] Roxb.), is a widely used tanning agent that also has had a long history of medicinal use as an astringent and antidiarrheal. The related species Uncaria rhynchophylla is 2007](#WHO.2007), [Heitzman 2005](#15649507) History Cat's claw has had a history of folkloric use in South America for wound healing and for treating arthritis, gastric ulcers, intestinal disorders, and some skin disorders and tumors. The part used medicinally is the inner bark of the vine or root. In Peru, a boiled decoction of U. guianensis is used as an anti-inflammatory, antirheumatic, and contraceptive agent, as well as for treating gastric ulcers and tumors, gonorrhea (by the Bora tribe), dysentery (by the Indian populations of Colombia and Guiana), and cancers of the urinary tract in women. The Ashanica Indians believe that samento (U. tomentosa) has life-giving properties and ingest a cup of the decoction every 1 to 2 weeks to ward off disease, treat bone pain, and cleanse the kidneys. Other reported uses include treatment for abscesses, asthma, chemotherapy adverse effects, fever, hemorrhage, rheumatism, skin impurities, urinary tract inflammation, weakness, and wounds, as well as for disease prevention and recovery from childbirth. Demand for the bark has been partially attributed to European reports of its clinical use with zidovudine in AIDS treatment. The demand for the bark in the United States is based on its purported use as a tea in treating diverticulitis, hemorrhoids, peptic ulcers, colitis, gastritis, parasites, and \"leaky gut syndrome.\" There are, however, no controlled clinical trials to support these uses. [WHO 2007](#WHO.2007), [Keplinger 1999](#10075119), [ Duke 1994](#Duke.1994) Chemistry Many reports exist on the chemical composition of the various Uncaria species and differentiations of the compounds found in different plant parts; reviews have also been published. More than 150 chemical compounds have been isolated from the genus, with approximately 50 chemical entities attributed to U. tomentosa, some of which possibly novel to that species. Two different chemotypes of U. tomentosa have been described, while U. guianensis and U. rhynchophylla have also been extensively studied. No official standardization exists, and commercially available preparations may consist of mixed plant sources despite claiming to be \"100% pure.\" Inter-batch variations have been reported. Key compounds common to the genus are primarily the indole and oxindole alkaloids, pentacyclic triterpenoids, and flavonoids. acids, glycosides, potent inhibitor of production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in vitro. The anti-inflammatory activity appears to involve suppression of TNF-alpha synthesis, as well as the secretion the phenolic and flavonoid content does not appear to be related to inhibition of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kB) because quinic acid esters were possibly associated with the anti-inflammatory activity of 2 extracts from U. tomentosa when tested in mouse paw edema( [Aguilar 2002](#12065162)); however, CNS pathways such as serotonin receptors may also be involved.( [J\u00fcrgensen 2005](#15907989)) Induced lung inflammation was reduced in mice pretreated with U. tomentosa bark extract,( [Cisneros 2005](#15619552)) while inflammatory-induced bone loss was attenuated partially due to a reduction in neutrophil migration and myeloperoxidase production in a periodontitis rat model.( [Lima 2020](#32920290)) Clinical data Limited clinical studies suggest an anti-inflammatory action of cat's claw in osteoarthritis.( [Hardin 2007](#17210508), [Mehta 2007](#17974032)) A small trial (N = 45) found improved subjective measures of pain with cat's claw; however, other objective measures were not significantly altered. Adverse effects were comparable with placebo.( [Piscoya 2001](#11603848)) In another small randomized trial (N = 40), U. tomentosa extract resulted in a reduction in the number of painful joints in patients with rheumatoid arthritis compared with placebo.( [Mur 2002](#11950006)) A 2010 systematic review identified 4 randomized controlled trials that studied cat's claw for osteo- or rheumatoid arthritis; 2 of the trials used the herb in combination with other herbs. Of the 2 using only cat's claw, one is cited above and the second additional randomized clinical trial was a double-blind trial conducted in 45 men with osteoarthritis of the knee. Administration of 100 mg cat's claw extract for 4 weeks led to significant improvements in pain with activity as well as both patient- and physician-assessed pain scores compared to placebo (P<0.001).( [Rosenbaum 2010](#20232616)) Antimicrobial activity In vitro data Alkaloidal extracts of U. tomentosa have shown in vitro antiviral activity against the vesicular stomatitis virus, rhinovirus, Dengue tomentosa extract has also demonstrated activity against SARS-CoV-2 in human airway epithelial cells that express high levels of ACE-2 receptors. At 25 mcg/mL, the extract inhibited 92.7% of SARS-CoV-2 growth (P<0.0001) while the positive control, chloroquine, 100% inhibition at 50 mcM (P<0.0001). Additionally, U. tomentosa extract significantly reduced the cytopathic effect of the virus by up to 98.6% (P=0.02). In silico modelling identified specific constituents of the extract that are capable of binding strongly to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein thereby blocking its attachment to ACE-2 receptors as well as disruptive actions at the SARS-CoV-2 /ACE-2 binding interface.( [Yepes-Perez 2021](#33680061), [Yepes-Perez 2020](#33118480)) Antibacterial activity has been demonstrated in vitro to human oral pathogens, such as S. mutans and S. aureus, but not C. albicans or P. aeruginosa.( [Ccahuana-Vasquez 2007](#17426895)) Cancer Experimental studies have shown antiproliferative (antimitotic) and apoptotic activity of extracts of U. tomentosa. as neuroblastoma and glioma.( [Garc\u00eda Prado 2007](#17296291)) A protective effect was demonstrated in vitro against ultraviolet damage of skin cells.( [Mammone 2006](#16521105)) Different preparations of U. tomentosa contain different alkaloids and result in varying cellular responses that may be related to antioxidant action rhynchophylla containing uncarine triterpenes have also for their cytotoxic effects.( [Laus 2004](#15162359), [Bae 2010](#20933226)) Animal data Studies in animal rodent models have shown a reduction in tumor growth with use of extracts of U. tomentosa.( [Pilarski 2010](#20576410)) Clinical data Clinical studies are limited. One ex vivo study using human leukemic cells obtained from children demonstrated an increased survival when exposed to extracts of U. tomentosa; therefore, caution is advised.( [Styczynski 2006](#16047362)) One phase 2 prospective open-label study investigated the safety and efficacy of dry root bark extract of U. tomentosa on adults with advanced solid tumors and no alternative therapeutic options. After 8 weeks of 100 mg 3 times daily, the average overall quality of life, social functioning, and fatigue improved significantly (P=0.041, P=0.034, and P=0.049, respectively); however, no tumor response to the medication was observed.( [de Paula 2015](#25495394)) Cardiovascular effects Older data from in vitro and animal studies suggested hypotensive, diuretic, and are lacking. CNS effects Animal and in vitro data Although the mechanism of action remains unclear, pteropodine and isopteropodine may increase the affinity of agonists or act as positive modulators of muscarinic M1 and 5-HT2 receptors, improving impaired cognitive processes.( [Kang 2002](#12191580)) In vitro binding of mitraphylline to amyloid protein( [Frackowiak 2006](#17294693)) and an apparent improvement in functioning in amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice by Yokukansan (a combination preparation containing Uncaria hook)( [Fujiwara 2011](#21303686)) suggest investigative potential as Alzheimer disease therapeutic agents. Yokukansan and U. rynchophylla have been evaluated for other aging, administration of cat's claw for 1 year as well as 1 month significantly improved some cognitive tests (eg, escape latency) compared to controls in middle-aged rats. However, overall spatial memory was similar between groups. Levels of acetylcholinesterase were found to be significantly lower in the cerebral cortex of animals treated for 1 month as well as 1 year with cat's claw compared to untreated controls.( [Castilhos 2020](#32628974)) Denture stomatitis Clinical data A systematic review of studies that investigated topical application of natural products compared to conventional antifungals for treatment of denture stomatitis identified one double-blind, randomized, controlled trial that administered cat's claw (N=48). After 14 days, the severity of denture stomatitis as well as the fungal load decreased in both groups with no significant difference between 2% cat's claw gel and miconazole.( [Ignacio Silveira 2021](#34247854)) Estrogen effects Animal data Studies are conflicting on the effect of U. tomentosa extracts on estrogen receptors.( [Bud\u00e1n 2011](#20799345)) In rats with induced endometriosis, cat's claw preparations decreased the volume of foci and exerted possible anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory activity.( [Nogueira Neto 2011](#21030132)) Immunomodulating In vitro data All individual alkaloids of U. tomentosa, with the exception of rhynchophylline and mitraphylline, have immunostimulant properties( [Wagner 1985](#4080851)) and the ability to enhance phagocytosis in vitro. Researchers have shown that pteropodine and isopteropodine have immune-stimulating effects.( [Jones 1994](#Jones.1994)) Clinical data Controlled clinical trials are lacking; however, an uncontrolled study suggested a positive effect on lymphocytes in HIV-positive individuals.( [Erowele 2009](#19451609)) Other uses Body mass index, energy expenditure, fasting blood glucose, blood insulin levels, liver insulin signaling, as well as hepatic collogen deposition and lipid content improved significantly (P<0.05 for each) with administration of cat's claw compared to controls in experimental NAFLD in 2 murine models of obesity (ie, high-fat diet, genetically obese).( Prophylactic a murine model of chronic insecticide exposure. Cat's claw led to significant improvements in total antioxidant capacity, total cholesterol, and activation of hepatic NF-kappaB as well as liver histology that approached that of controls.( [Elgawish 2019](#30387063)) In a periodontitis rat model, cat's claw extract improved inflammatory-induced bone loss via reductions in bone resorption, attachment loss, and osteoclasogenesis without altering liver or kidney indices. In addition to attenuating osteoclast formation, a reduction in myeloperoxidase indicated a significantly lower migration of neutrophils to the gingival tissue.( [Lima 2020](#32920290)) Dosing One gram of root bark given 2 to 3 times daily is a typical dose, while 20 to 30 mg of a root bark extract has been recommended. [WHO 2007](#WHO.2007) Clinical trials are generally lacking to support appropriate dosages. A standardized extract based on a particular chemotype of this species containing 8% to and less than 0.5% oxindole alkaloids has been used in clinical studies in doses of 250 to 300 mg. [Lehmann-Willenbrock 1988](#2841818), [Sheng 2001](#11515717) Pregnancy / Lactation Information regarding safety and efficacy during pregnancy and lactation is lacking.

Monitor therapy.( [Lopez Galera 2008](#18712519)) Adverse Reactions Case reports of adverse events are rare, although information is lacking. The American Herbal Products Association rates Uncaria preparations as class 4 (lack of data to support safety).( [Erowele 2009](#19451609), [Piscoya 2001](#11603848)) Possible adverse effects include GI complaints (nausea, diarrhea, stomach discomfort), renal effects (a case report of acute renal failure exists), hormonal effects (in vitro data suggest extracts may interact with estrogen-receptor binding sites), neuropathy (a case report of worsened Parkinson disease symptoms exists),( [Cosentino 2008](#18836348)) and an increased risk of was reported in a 38-year-old woman with a history of Lyme disease, osteoarthritis, gallstones, and irritable bowel syndrome who had been taking several dietary supplements for a few years. Three of the supplements contained silica dioxide as an ingredient, one of which was cat's claw. Her symptoms of flank pain and gravel-like urine sediment resolved upon discontinuation of her supplements and recurred upon restarting them.( [Flythe 2009](#19100669)) Cat's claw present in several multi-ingredient nutritional supplements was hypothesized as being a facilitator to inducing serotonin syndrome in a 37-year-old female. However, her complex medical history that involved multiple medications for anxiety, depression, GI, sinusitis, and headaches accompanied by her recent weight loss routine that entailed consuming nutritional supplements instead of eating prevents certainty of the role of cat's claw.( [Ragsdell 2021](#34384007)) It is recommended that Uncaria-containing products be avoided before and after surgery, by those using immunosuppressant therapy, and in children due to lack of safety data.( [Erowele 2009](#19451609)) Data collected between 2004 and 2013 from 8 US centers in the Drug-induced Liver Injury Network revealed that 15.5% (130) of hepatotoxicity cases were caused by herbals and dietary supplements, whereas 85% (709) of cases were related to prescription medications. Of the 130 cases of liver injury related to supplements, 65% were from non-bodybuilding supplements and occurred most often in Hispanics/Latinos compared with non-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks. Liver transplant was also more frequent with toxicity from non-bodybuilding supplements (13%) than with conventional medications (3%) (P<0.001). Overall, the proportion of severe liver injury cases was significantly higher for supplements than for conventional medications (P=0.02). Of the 217 supplement products implicated in liver injury, 175 had identifiable ingredients, of which cat's claw was among the 32 (18%) single-ingredient products.( [Navarro 2014](#25043597)) Toxicology Historical ethnomedicinal evidence and current use by consumers suggest low toxicity; however, toxicological studies are limited. In rats, the median lethal dose of a single dose of a water extract of U. tomentosa was determined to be greater than 8 g/kg. In humans, there were no toxic adverse effects observed at a repeated dose of 350 mg/day for 6 rhynchophylla References Disclaimer This information relates to an herbal, vitamin, mineral or other dietary supplement.
