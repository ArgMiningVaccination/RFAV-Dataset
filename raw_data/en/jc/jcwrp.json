Staying safe Our restrictions have eased, but we still need to keep up healthy habits to keep ourselves and our whnau safe. We have a relatively highly vaccinated population and most people know they can self-manage COVID-19 and access support if needed. This means we can slowly start to focus on returning to a normal way of life. For some people, the easing of restrictions will be stressful \u2014 especially if we have friends or whnau who are vulnerable. It is okay to feel scared or anxious as we adjust to the new settings. You can decide what additional measures suit you best. Let whnau, friends, neighbours and colleagues know what they can do to support you. If you are worried, talk to your doctor or health professional for advice. How to protect yourself - Get your booster vaccine if you are eligible. If you have not been vaccinated yet, talk to your doctor or health professional for advice. [Vaccine advice if you have a health condition.](/covid-19-vaccines/covid-19-vaccine-facts-and-advice/vaccine-advice-if-you-have-a-health-condition/) - Keep a safe distance away from people you do not live with \u2014 except for your carer or support workers. - You can wear a face mask whenever you leave home. If you have visitors at home, ask them to wear a face mask. - We recommend you wear a face mask when visiting healthcare services and encourage you to wear one when you are in closed, crowded and confined spaces. [Wearing a face mask](/prepare-and-stay-safe/protect-yourself-and-others-from-covid-19/face-masks/wearing-a-face-mask/) - Ask friends or whnau who do not live with you to take a rapid antigen test (RAT) before they visit. - Stay at home if you are unwell. - Get tested if you have cold, flu or COVID-19 symptoms as soon as you start to feel unwell \u2014 even if the symptoms are mild. Doing a test and reporting the result in My Covid Record means you can be connected with any help and support you might need. - Try to avoid large crowds \u2014 if the supermarket is busy, try again later, or use other options like click and collect. - If possible, arrange to meet with friends and whnau outside. If it makes you feel more comfortable, you can ask them to wear a face mask. - If you are gathering indoors, let fresh air in to reduce the risk of catching or spreading COVID-19. Even though the number of people who can gather indoors has increased, organisers still need to follow public health guidelines to keep everyone safe. You could ask the organisers for a livestream option, if you feel more comfortable participating from home. - Stay connected \u2014 if you are not ready to start socialising in large groups, find other ways to keep in touch with close friends and whnau. Free face masks If you are at higher risk of severe illness, you can get free P2/N95 face masks when you pick up rapid antigen tests (RATs) from a testing centre. You do not need to be unwell or have COVID-19 symptoms. Find a collection centre near you on the Healthpoint website, or by calling [0800 222 478](tel:0800%20222 478) and choosing option 1.

We recommend you wait 3 months after testing positive before getting any COVID-19 vaccination. If you are at high risk of getting seriously ill if you do test positive for COVID-19 again, we recommend you talk to your doctor or health professional for advice on the best timing for your vaccinations. You may be able to receive your vaccination sooner. Going to work and school Going to work As restrictions ease, we encourage you to talk to your employer about flexible working arrangements. If you have been working from home for a long time, it can take a while to adjust back to working in an office or other workplace. Let your colleagues and employer know if there is something they can do to make working easier and safer for you. If you work in an area where there is a high risk of exposure to COVID-19, such as some healthcare settings, you can discuss and agree with your employer a risk assessment and options for different ways of working. Going to school or kura If your child is immunocompromised, or at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19, talk to their school or kura about whether changes can be made at their school. The best way to protect your tamariki is by getting them vaccinated against COVID-19. If you live with or are visiting someone who is at higher risk You can support friends and whnau by: - meeting outside where there is better ventilation. You may want to wear a face mask if it is difficult to keep a safe distance away - isolating away from them if you test positive for COVID-19, or are unwell - offering to drop off groceries or essential supplies - not visiting them if you are unwell - keeping in touch with them, and checking up on their physical and mental wellbeing - checking if their aged residential care facility has extra measures in place for visitors - being kind and showing compassion for others. Give other people space, and keep a safe distance away.
