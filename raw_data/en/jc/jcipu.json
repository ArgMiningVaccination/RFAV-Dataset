The 16-member committee dedicates over 900 hours each year to develop recommendations that ensure adequate allocations from the soda tax keep working for all San Franciscans. We are thrilled to see that the collaboration between the SDDTAC and community partners positively impacts our communities in San Francisco, especially Black and Brown communities suffering from chronic diseases. As the overall focus of the COVID-19 pandemic shifts, our SDDTAC and our community partners continue to to see the devastating impacts of the pandemic, including the exacerbation of food insecurity and many other existing health disparities specifically for com munities of color and our m ost vulnerable populations. The SDDTAC will continue to m ake funding recommendations that benefit our comm unity during these unprecedented times and honor the intent of the tax set forth by voters of Proposition V. In Fiscal Year 2022-2023, SDDTAC prioritized (SDDT) dollars to the issues our communities care most about including: Identified Community-Based Grants as the most important and impactful funding category Considered the ways to incorporate more youth involvement through possible increasing youth seats on SDDTAC Expanded access to healthy food, water, and oral health Equitable access to healthy food for low-income people and students Ensured continued access to safe and affordable physical activity More details of our recommendations and supporting evidence can be found in the annual report attached to this letter. Highlights of our annual report and updates from this past year include but not limited to: Build community capacity and develop leadership among community stakeholders Provide job readiness, skill training, and career pathways Increase economic opportunities in priority neighborhoods Increase healthy messaging related to nutritionAs co-chairs of the committee, we thank Mayor London Breed, San Francisco Board of Supervisors and San Francisco Residents, as well as the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) Staff, our Research Evaluators (Raimi & Associates), our SDDTAC colleagues, and the community voices we hear for their tireless efforts and commitment to this important work. We have evidence that the soda tax is working here in San Francisco - especially for communities most impacted by chronic disease. We strongly encourage the Mayor and Board of Supervisors to follow the annual budget recommendations from the Sugary Drinks Distributor Tax Advisory Committee. Thank you.

ARTICLE XXXIII: Sugary Drinks Distributor Tax Advisory Committee (San Francisco Administrative Code) E. Sugary Drinks Distributor Tax Advisory Committee Bylaws 2 I. BACKGROUND a. Sugary Drinks Distributor Tax Legislation In November 2016, San Francisco voters passed Proposition V. Proposition V established a one penny per ounce fee on the initial distribution of a bottled sugar -sweetened beverage, syrup, or powder, within the City and County of San Francisco. The Sugary Drinks Distributor Tax ( SDDT) is a general excise tax on the privilege of conducting business within the City and County of San Francisco. It is not a sales tax or use tax or other excise tax on the sale, consumption, or use of sugar -sweetened beverages. The funds collected from this tax are to be deposited in the General Fund. The legislation defines a sugary drink, or sugary -sweetened beverage (SSB), as follows: A sugar -sweetened beverage (SSB) means any non- alcoholic beverage intended for human consumption that contains caloric sweetener and contains 25 or more calories per 12 fluid ounces of beverage, including but not limited to all drinks and beverages commonly referred to or any other similar names. The passage of Proposition V established two pieces of law: the Sugary Drinks Distributor Tax (also referred to as soda tax) in Business and Tax Regulations Code and the Sugary Drinks Distributor Tax Advisory Committee (referred to in this report as \"Committee\") in the City's Administrative Code. The ordinance stated that the Committee shall consist of 16 voting members, who are appointed by either the Board of Supervisors or certain City departments. The powers and duties of the Committee are to make recommendations to the Mayor and the Board of Supervisors on the effectiveness of the Sugary Drinks Distributor Tax and to submit a report that evaluates the impact of the Sugary Drinks Distributor Tax on beverage prices, consumer purchasing behavior, and public health. The Committee is to also provide recommendations regarding the potential establishment and/or funding of programs to reduce the consumption of sugar -sweetened beverages in San Francisco. In May 2018, the SF Department of Public Health was requested to assume staffing of the Committee. The Mayor's Office formalized the change in administrative oversight of the Committee from the City Administrator's Office to Department of Public Health through a transfer of function of the 3 Executive Branch pursuant to S ec. 4.132 of the City Charter. Unless the Board of Supervisors by ordinance extends the term of the Committee, it shall expire by operation of law, and the Committee shall terminate, on December 31, 2028. b. Report Requirements and Process Starting in 2018, by March 1, of each year, the Committee shall submit to the Board of Supervisors and the Mayor a report that evaluates the impact of the Sugary Drinks Distributor Tax on beverage prices, consumer purchasing behavior, and public health. The Committee in their report shall make recommendations regarding the potential establishment and/or funding of programs to reduce the consumption of sugary drinks in San Francisco. Within 10 days after the submission of the report, the Department of Public Health (per change referenced above) shall submit to the Board of Supervisors a proposed resolution for the Board to receive the report. 4 c. Relationship Between Sugary Drink Consumption, Health, Health Equity and Taxes A large body of evidence exists indicating that sugary drink consumption increases risk for cavities, overweight/obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension and heart disease.i20 -v Although sugary drinks can contain hundreds of calories in a serving, they do not signal \"fullness\" to the brain and thus facilitate overconsumption. vi Sugary drinks account for nearly half of the total added sugars in a typical American diet. About half of adults and over 60% of kids consume a sugary drink on any given day xiv-xvii. Sugary drinks are the leading source of sugar in the American diet, contributing 36% of the added sugar Americans consume. vii Numerous organizations and agencies, including the American Heart Association, American Diabetes Association, American Academy of Pediatrics, Institute of Medicine of the National Academies, American Medical Association, and the Centers for Disease Control, recommend limiting intake of added sugar and sugary drinks to improve health. Studies show that sugary drinks flood the liver with high amounts of sugar in a short amount of time and that this \"sugar rush\" over time leads to fat deposits and metabolic disturbances that are associated with the deve lopment of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and other serious health problems viii. Of note, every additional sugary drink consumed daily can increase a child's risk for obesity by 60%ix and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 26%.x Diseases connected to sugary drinks are also found to disproportionately impact ethnic minority and low - income communities - the very communities that are found to consume higher amounts of sugary drinks. Diabetes hospitalizations are approximately three times as high in low - income communities as compared with higher income communities. African American death rates from diabetes are two times higher than San Francisco's overall rate. In San Francisco, a pproximately 42% of adults are estimated to be obese or overweight, including 66% of Latinx and 73% of African Americans. With respect to oral health, the data indicate that Asian and Pacific Islander children suffer from cavities at a higher rate than oth er populations; but Latinx and African American children also have a higher prevalence than the average for cavities. While many factors contribute to sugary drink consumption, including wide availability/ access and affordability , the role of industry is relevant as well. A 5 recent study by Rudd xiv documents that food and beverage companies continue to disproportionately target Black and Hispanic consumers with TV advertising for almost exclusively unhealthy packaged food and beverage categories. Most companies in this analysis have healthier brands in their portfolios, including plain water, low -sugar cereals, yogurt, plain dairy, fruits, and vegetables that could be promoted but they choos e to disproportionately advertise their least nutritious brands, including sugary drinks, candy, chips, and high- sugar cereals, to Black and Latinx consumers , and we see the health costs to those communities . The study specifically found th e following: Food and beverage TV advertising targets Black and Latino consumers. o In 2021, Black youth and adults viewed 9% to 21% more food and beverage TV ads compared to their White peers. o Companies increased their focus on advertising to Spanish -speaking TV viewers, evidenced by an increase in the proportion of TV ad dollars companies dedicated to Spanish -language TV from2017 to 2021 (7.8% vs. 8.5%). Targeted TV ads primarily promote unhealthy food and beverages. o Candy, sugary drinks, snacks and cereal made up 73% of food and beverage ad spending on Black -targeted and Spanish -language TV in 2021. o This advertising contributes to inequities in diet- related diseases heavily affecting communities of color, including heart disease and diabetes. o There was no advertising fruits or vegetables on Spanish - language or Black-targeted TV in 2021. o Most U.S. food companies have healthier brands in their portfolios, including plain water, low -sugar cereals, yogurt and plain dairy, fruits and vegetables that could be promoted. Numerous marketing campaigns, including in social media, target youth and communities of color : o Many marketing campaigns incorporated hip -hop and Latino music celebrities and other youth -oriented themes, as well as cause- related marketing with donations and collaborations with non- profits to benefit communities of color and foster goodwill for food and beverage brands. o Major brands were responsible for the majority of marketing campaigns that targeted youth and communities of color. o Racially and ethnically targeted marketing campaigns almost exclusively promoted unhealthy products. Other research studies bolster the Rudd finding with respect to beverage companies focus ing advertisingxviii, xvix and retail marketingxx efforts on Black/ African Americans and Latinx Americans, as well as on childrenxxi. 6 It's no wonder then, that Black/ African Americans and Latinx Americans drink more sugary drinks compared to non -Latinx White Americansxxi, xxii. Among households with young children, those with lower incomes purchased more sweetened fruit drinks compared to households with higher incomesxxiii . The Sugary Drinks Distributor Tax is intended to discourage the distribution and consumption of sugary drinks in San Francisco by taxing their distribution. A recent study conducted in San Francisco by the Public Health Institute's Prevention Policy Group showed the tax is working as intended: consumption of SSBs declined markedly (34%) in San Francisco in the first two years after implementation of the soda tax xxv. Key findings from PHI's study note a 34.1% drop in consumption of sugary drinks in the San Francisco sample at two years post -tax, versus a 16.5% drop in San Jos\u00e9, which did not institute a tax. In San Francisco, the probability of consuming more than 6 ounces per day decreased by 4.3% in the first year and by 13.6% in the two years post- tax. In San Jos\u00e9, this decrease was just 1% in the first year and less than 1% at two years post -tax. There was a significant difference in change over time (13.2%) in high consumption of SSBs between the two cities two years after the tax started. High SSB consumption decreased 23.6% among San Francisco respondents who were living below 200% of the federal poverty level, while increasing in San Jos\u00e9, yielding another significant difference in change over time between the cities. The study sampled different racial and ethnic groups from zip codes in San Jose and San Francisco, with a higher density of Black and Latino residents and racial/ethnic groups with higher SSB consumption in California. This analysis paints a fuller and more robust picture of the positive health impact of soda tax policies and suggests that even a modest size tax can be effective in reducing high SSB consumption and mitigating the risk of harm . These findings support the preliminary analysis of sales data which indicated that the soda tax is successful in decreasing consumption: purchases of sugar -sweetened beverages at supermarkets in San Francisco decreased by more than 50% in the two years following the implementation of the tax xiii. Mexico, where an average of 163 liters of sugary drinks are consumed per person each year, enacted an excise tax on sugary drinks in 2014, with the result that the purchase of taxed sugary d rinks declined by 12% generally and by 17% among low- income Mexicans by December 2014. The Mexico data indicate that, when people cut back on sugary drinks, to a significant extent they choose lower -caloric or non -caloric alternatives. Studies have 7 project ed that a 10% reduction in sugary drink consumption in Mexico would result in about 189,300 fewer incident type 2 diabetes cases, 20,400 fewer incident strokes and myocardial infarctions, and 18,900 fewer deaths occurring from 2013 to 2022. This modeling p redicts the sugary drinks tax could save Mexico $983 million international dollars. xi Following the implementation of Berkeley, California's sugary drink tax, the first in the nation, there was a 50% decline in sugary drink consumption among diverse adults over the first 3 years of the tax. xii Modeling suggests that a national sugary drink tax that reduced consumption by just 20% would avert 101,000 and result in $23.6 billion in healthcare cost savings over just 5 years. The tax is further estimated to generate $12.5 billion in annual revenue. This body of research demonstrates that taxation provides a powerful incentive for individuals to reduce their consumption of sugary drinks, w hich in turn can reduce the burden of chronic disease. d.

Sugary Drinks Distributor Tax Revenue & Revenue Projections The City and County of San Francisco operates on a July -June fiscal year (FY). Each year the Mayor and Board of Supervisors pass a rolling, two- year budget, with the second year becoming the first year of the next budget cycle; similarly, the Committee makes rolling, two -year recommendations. SDDT Revenues The Treasurer and Tax Collector collects the revenue and the Controller's office reports the revenues as indicated in the \"Actual\" column below (to track revenues ). The Controller's office projects expected revenue, shown in the \"Projected\" column in the table below. Tax collection began January 1, 2018. Between January 2018 - February 28, 202 3 a total of $66,250,476 has been collected. SDDT Revenue Projected Actual FY 2017- 2018 Actual The amount available to the SDDTAC to recommend is determined after voter -mandated set asides (about 22%) . Additionally, the Board of Supervisors appropriated $1.2 million of the $11.6 million in ongoing \"Healthy Addbacks\" during the FY2017-18 budget process. In January 2023, the Controller's Office projected figures for the SDDTAC to make recommendations for $11,000,000 for both FY2023-24 and FY2024-25. 11 II. Sugary Drinks Distributor Tax Advisory Committee Recommendations a. SDDT Advisory Committee Process The Committee meets monthly with the Department of Public Health (DPH) serving as backbone staff. In addition to the full monthly Committee meetings, many Committee members participated in one or two subcommittees. The three subcommittees are : Data and Evidence , Community Input, and Infrastructure. S ubcommittees gathered input from experts, stakeholders, and community groups . The full Committee also heard community input at meetings and each subcommittee was encouraged to incorporate public feedback in its recommendations. For this set of recommendations, the Committee adopted a new tool, the AliahThink Tool for Strategic Planning . This tool was used to support values -based, collaborative decision making, building on the knowledge of the Committee and community . The final prioritizations guided the Committee when making its budget recommendations. As with all Committee meetings, the process was documented in the Committee and Sub-Committee The Committee is tasked with making two -year budget recommendations to coincide with the City's two -year budget cycle every year. The Committee expects new information will emerge during the course of the year from funded organizations, ongoing community input, new data and evidence, etc. that will inform potential changes to its second year budget recommendations. For example, this year the Committee is making recommendations for expenditures in FY2 3-24 and FY24-25 . The Committee will re- evaluate its FY2 3-24 recommendations at the end of 2023 and may make changes, if deemed appropriate, for its final FY2 4-25 recommendations in early 202 4. Given the Committee's legislative mandate to evaluate the impact of the SDDT and Mayor London Breed's commitment to accountability (\"Make every dollar count\") of public dollars, the Committee continues to recommend that revenue generated from t he SDDT be indicated in such a way that City Departments know that they have received funding that was generated from SDDT revenue. Such notation makes it possible for the 12 committee to fulfill its legislative mandate with respect to documenting the impact the SDDT is having in San Francisco. The Committee voted on February 1 5, 202 3, to make the funding recommendations for FY202 3-24 and FY202 4-25 as described in the recommendations section. Subcommittee Reports Data and Evidence Subcommittee The mission of the Data and Evidence Subcommittee is to review, analyze and share research within the context of our San Francisco communities to help inform and support the work of the Sugary Drinks Distributor Tax Advisory Committee (SDDTAC). The Data and Evidence subcommittee supported broadening the scope of funded activities to support economic development and improving health outcomes. The Subcommittee worked to enable further collaborative learning by: Piloting use of strategic planning software (Aliah Think Tool) ; Hosting subject matter experts, i.e., sales data, sugary history; and Ensuring that soda tax efforts create healthier communities for low-income and populations of color, who are hardest hit by COVID and soda industry marketing and the health impacts of their products. The duties of the Data and Evidence subcommittee are to: Collect and review research and data that would be helpful to the work of the Committee; Help inform and support efforts to analyze the impact of the SDDT on sugary drink pricing, public health, and consumer purchasing behavior; Help inform efforts to evaluate programs and work funded by SDDT. T he Data and Evidence Subcommittee accomplishments include: 1. Updated a work plan that identifies subcommittee tasks in alignment with the goals of the SDDTAC. 2. Provided critical feedback on SDDT Evaluation Review - Raimi & Associates shared logic model: goals, strategies, outcomes, impact and metrics regarding the evaluation plan. 3. Pilot tested the Aliah Think tool strategic planning software to 13 prioritize SDDT budget domains and sub elements. 4. Approved Raimi & Associates evaluation report FY 2021 -2022 5. Discussed keeping a database of current and relevant evidence- based literature including blogs, op eds, etc. 6. Discussed data and evidence con tent for SDDTAC newsletter. 7. Continued discussion on SDDTAC request to review data and evidence on pipeline pathway development for young people into health career pathways, hearing from local experts and reviewing literature on the subject to make recommendations on SDDTAC support for health career pathways 8. Provided opportunity for SFUSD Student Nutrition Services to present to subcommittee on sustainable strategies for in house student food prep. 9. Reviewed and commented on FY 23 -24 & FY 24- 25 budget and made recommendations for the SDDTAC Future Considerations for the Data & Evidence Subcommittee: The Committee has requested the data and evidence subcommittee to research and provide recommended strategy for mental health, health career pathways and public health education (including COVID guidelines) and to propose percentage of investments as a committee. Subcommittee requests revisiting \"Priority communities are those that experience disproportionate burden of diet- related chronic diseases and those targeted by the soda industry, these same communities are also disproportionately impacted by COVID, and we understand that diet -related chronic disease is a risk factor for illness and death for COVID.\" In addition, the Data and Evidence Subcommittee will continue to update research/evidence database with respect to the economic impact of the sugar sweetened beverage tax, racism and health disparities research, mental health, social determinants of health and the impact of COVID 19 on priority populations. The Data and Evidence Subcommittee remains committed to helping inform the Committee recommendations guided by data and evidence, relying on DPH staff for latest data and relying on the network of scientific community for the latest evidence in the context of community through the remaining time of the SDDTAC on behalf of all the residents of the City and County of San Francisco. 14 The following members of the SDDTAC were active members of the Data and Ev idence Subcommittee during the development of this report: o Saeeda Hafiz (Seat 8: San Francisco Unified School District) Data & Evidence Subcommittee Chair o Abby Cabrera (Seat 4: research/medical institution) SDDTAC Co- Chair o Marna Armstead (Seat 3: Health equity Black/African American) SDDTAC Co-Chair o Diana Lau (Seat 5: research/medical institution) o Irene Hilton (Seat 11: DPH oral health) The Data and Evidence Subcommittee met monthly with a total of 11 meetings between Marc h 2022 - February 2023: March 9, 2022 April 13, 2022 May 11, 2022 June 8, 2022 July 2022 - Meeting Cancelled August 10, 2022 September 14, 2022 October 12, 2022 November 9, 2022 December 7, 2022 January 11, 2023 February 8, 2023 Community Input Subcommittee The mission of the Community Input Subcommittee is to ensure that meaningful community engagement opportunities are fully integrated throughout the work of the Committee, so that impacted populations can inform the decisions of the full committee. This Subcommittee recognizes the disproportionate health burdens felt by communities of color and low -income communities and the need to have members of these communities actively participate in shaping funding recommendations for strategies, approaches and serv ices that contribute to decreasing the consumption of sugary drinks for those most impacted, as well as all San Franciscans. This Subcommittee also recognizes the necessity for the Committee to create mechanisms by which information about the recommendation process and the implementation of the SDDT can be communicated to members of the public, including disproportionately impacted communities. With this as our guiding perspective, the Community Input Subcommittee worked in partnership with the Department of 15 Public Health (DPH), who provided backbone staffing for the Subcommittee, to support and give feedback related to community engagement and outreach efforts. The Subcommittee continued to emphasize the importance of making all meetings accessible and open to the public and to developing meaningful and creative mechanisms to communicating how SDDT funds are being utilized to support those communities most targeted by the beverage industry. These items can be uplifted into agenda items as they have each been discussed at this year's meetings. The duties of the Community Input subcommittee are to: 1. Evaluate the funding process and extent to which the intent of the original recommendations are implemented through community input; 2. Make recommendations to full committee for any needed improvements to next round of recommendations/funding process based on community input; 3. Advocate for SDDT funded organizations to get the support they need; as well those who may need support responding to calls for proposals; 4. Solicit input from the community about SDDTAC recommendations and related processes; 5. Advocate for community engagement activities such as Town Hall meetings, be present at such events, and report back to the committee; 6. Re commend the addition of public engagement component be a part of the funding process; 7. In collaboration with the Infrastructure Subcom mittee, develop a process for some funded organizations to report out to the Committee and the public what they have done or what they intend to do; and 8. Oversee strategic outreach to communities. Community Input Subcommittee accomplishments include: (1) Developed recommendations to the full committee on utilization of this year's funds for community engagement. (2) Reviewed legislation amendments and identify community outreach/ input strategy (3) Researched to amend current SDDTAC process to define community seat representation and increase youth seats (4) Reviewed previous accountability tracker and framework for the full committee to identify how each member is gathering input and reporting back to communities they represent; 16 (5) Piloted use of the AliahThink tool for prioritization of SDDT budget domains and sub elements; (6) Developed a proposal to SDDTAC for SDDTAC for any upcoming legislative sign on support or opposition letters; (7) Re viewed subcommittee workplan: quarterly cadence to ensure alignment and assess impact (8) Provided input to Raimi & Associates for the evaluation plan reporting; (9) Discussed subcommittee content for SDDTAC newsletter (10) Reviewed and discussed subcommit tee FY 23- 24 and FY 24- 25 funding recommendations; and (11) Discussed and reviewed subcommittee's report for the Committee's 2023 Annual Report. Considerations for Future Community Input Opportunities The Community Input Subcommittee continues to be committed to ensuring the bidirectional flow of information between communities most impacted by the harms of sugary drinks and SDDTAC.

Future Considerations for Infrastructure Subcommittee In general, existing data sources for 1) beverage prices, 2) consumer purchasing behavior, and 3) public health (particularly diet -sensitive chronic disease which the Committee is particularly interested in given the impact of sugary beverages on these con ditions) are not 19 robust. It can be difficult to recognize changes in nutrition, food security, physical activity, and diet -sensitive chronic disease. Thus , the Committee has made recommendations to support data and evaluation infrastructure to better understand the impact of the SDDT especially on the communities most affected by the impact of sugary beverages. In addition, infrastructure subcommittee will ensure the completed versions of strategic plan is incorporated in future work plans. The Infrastructure Subcommittee will continue to explore a process or a policy around how the SDDTAC Committee can address emerging needs, such as the COVID -19 pandemic. The following members of the Committee were active members of the Infrastructure Subcommittee during the development of this report: o Larry McClendon (Seat 7 - Office of Economic and Workforce Development), chair of Infrastructure Subcommittee o Tiffany Kenison (Seat 10 - Department of Public Health, Chronic Disease) - as of June 1, 2022 o Michelle Kim (Seat 13, Department of Children Youth & Their Families) o Linda Barnard (Seat 14, Recreation and Parks Department) o Maureen Guerrero (Seat 15, Children 0-5 Years Old) On Leave August 2022 - January 2023 Since the release of the last year's annual report, the Infrastructure subcommittee met monthly between March 202 2-February 202 3 for approximately 2 hours each.

CBG should support community -based programs and services that address the health inequities of those most targeted by the beverage industry. Funding should go to Community Based Organizations (CBOs) and Faith Based Organizations (FBOs) for the following strategies: Health Education activities including, chronic disease prevention, healthy eating and active living, tap water promotion, oral/dental health; Physical Activity opportunities, including a) Dance and movement, sports, yoga, walking groups, biking, etc.; b) Changes to the built environment (i.e. sidewalks, streets, parks, buildings, etc. ) or safety of the built environment that facilitates increased physical activity and active transportation). 3. Food Security, including a) Community -based pantries, community -based hot meals, community kitchens and community home delivery services; b) In creased financial resources (i.e. wages, income, government nutrition supplements, vouchers, etc.); c) Changes to the built environment that facilitate food security; d) Pursuit of institutional or local policies that facilitate food security; and e) Food Access, including community -based food systems, approaches, community - based pantries, community -based hot meals, community kitchens and community home delivery services, etc. 4) Water Promotion, such as support for Spa Water Supplies, station maintenance and beautification, refillable water bottles to distribute to communities, water testing. 5) Community Based Participatory Research. Food As Medicine MediCal Waiver Program One time infrastructure and capacity building grants for 10 community based food organizations to prepare them to contract with health plans, use medical coding and billing, share confidential patient information, and other areas needed to access Medi -Cal funding for meals and groceries and nutrition services rendered . This funding will build off of the successful capacity building cohort piloted in FY 2022 -2023 which included 7 CBOs receiving both tailored, individualized technical assistance and cohort -level training and capacity building. Currently no CBOs are contracted with the SF Health Plan, the main Medi -Cal managed care plan serving the city, to deliver medically supportive food and nutrition services. CBOs working with SFUSD Recommend 3% of all CBO funding should go towards CBOs implementing programs/initiatives that take place in school settings. Funding to issue grants to CBOs should follow the guidelines above. SFUSD School Food, Nutrition Education To improve the quality and appeal of school meals and support nutrition education to increase participation in school meal programs (for example: cooking and serving equipment, staff professional development, and innovative procurement and menu strategies to increase freshly prepared food). Funding will target schools with the largest populations of high-risk students that are disproportionately targeted by the sugary drinks industry. Student Led Action Support student led efforts to decrease consumption of sugary drinks and increase awareness of sugary drinks consumption among students, with focus on schools with the largest populations of high-risk students that are disproportionately targeted by the sugary drinks industry. SFUSD should provide to SDDTAC a proposal of how funding will be spent through student led action. Funding to also support adequate staffing for implementation. 23 FOOD ACCESS Healthy Food Purchasing Supplement* Support programs that increase financial resources to purchase healthy food such as vouchers and food purchasing incentives. These funds should be RFP'd out to CBOs and FBOs . Funding should support programs and services that increase financial resources to purchase healthy food; access to healthy fruits and vegetables while minimizing processed foods for high-risk communities; foods that are affordable and convenient; and programs that support the consumption of healthy foods including the ability to prepare and store meals and the knowledge of basic nutrition, food safety and cooking. Priority programs should incorporate a community -based food security perspective and have demonstrated increased ability of food insecure residents to purchase, access, and consume consumption of healthy, fresh, low-to-no cost and culturally appropriate foods, including but not limited to food vouchers/ incentives, transportation and delivery and prepared foods. Healthy Retail SF Supporting small business to increase healthy food access in high risk, impacted communities and neighborhoods by: 1) supporting business operations; 2) promoting community engagement; and 3) improving the retail environment.

Impact on Beverage Prices and Consumer Purchasing Behavior & Public Health a. IRI Beverage Sales Data SFDPH worked with the EVIDENCE project, a n interdisciplinary academic research team (with UCSF and UC Berkeley) to purchase beverage sales data. The SDDT epidemiologist was activated as a disaster service worker to support COVID -19 response, therefore no data are not yet analyzed . Sales data for 2021 and 2022 will be analyzed in the coming months by the SFDPH epidemiologist . b. Public Health Data Report An updated Data Report was not developed due to ongoing COVID -19 demands on the epidemiologist. Those demands are dwindling, and a new data report is expected in 2023. Public health data change minimally from year to year, thus, we refer readers to the Fall 2019 Data Report which can be found at the SDDTAC webpage. IV. Impact of SDDT SDDT Fiscal Year 21-22 Evaluation Report SF Department of Public Health partnered with Raimi + Associates to conduct the evaluation of SDDT funded city agencies, community -based organizations and initiatives. The impact of the SDDT is captured in the evaluation report which can be found in the appendices or on the SDDTAC webpage. SDDT funds support a wide range of programs, services and organizations . In 2022 the evaluation team developed a data dashboard which provides current and historical information about distribution of SDDT funds. The following are evaluation findings for SDDT funding in Fiscal Year 2021- 2022 (FY 2021-22), which includes July 1, 2021- June 30, 2022.

SDDT FY 20 -21 Evaluation Report San Francisco Sugary Drinks Distributor Tax (SDDT) EVALUATION REPORT 2021-2022 PREPARED BY:Letter of Introduction DEAR MAYOR LONDON BREED, SAN FRANCISCO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS, AND SAN FRANCISCO RESIDENTS, We are excited to share the evaluation findings from work supported by the Sugary Drinks Distributor Tax (SDDT) during fiscal year 2021- 2022. As the COVID-19 pandemic has evolved over the past year, SDDT- funded organizations and agencies have returned to providing in-person, culturally-responsive services, programs, and education across San Francisco, and especially in the neighborhoods most impacted by diet- sensitive chronic diseases. We are proud of the reach and impact that SDDT is having on our city. Some examples include: At least 49,850 people participated in SDDT-funded grant programs between July 2021 and June 2022. 24,132 SFUSD students (or 46% of all enrolled SFUSD students) attended schools that received SDDT funding for infrastructure to support fruit, vegetable, and tap water consumption. Although SDDT funded-entities, as a group, supported work in every neighborhood across the city, data from this past fiscal year demonstrate that services, programs, and engagement efforts were focused in the neighborhoods most impacted by diet-sensitive chronic diseases. Moreover, SDDT funding has continued to support low-income San Franciscans; children, youth, and young adults; and community members who identify as Asian, Black/African American, Latinx, Native American/ Indigenous, and/or Pacific Islander. This evaluation report also highlights funding from the last three years and the impact of multi-year funding. For example, SDDT's commitment to multiyear funding has supported organizational stability, increased the effectiveness of Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC)-led and BIPOC-serving programming, and increased community capacity among BIPOC community members. Furthermore, SDDT's funding of structural interventions is an approach to both prioritize with limited resources and to achieve important and positive health benefits at a population level. For example, the impact of SDDT funding to improve kitchen facilities and infrastructure at SFUSD schools within the last three years has resulted in lasting and significant impacts on students' nutritional behavior. Finally, we continue to track key outcomes identified in the San Francisco SDDTAC Strategic Plan. We are especially excited that this report documents some of the positive outcomes of work supported with SDDT funds, as well as of the impact that the tax has had on the purchase and consumption of sugary drinks in San Francisco. The SDDTAC remains committed to making community- and results- driven recommendations to ensure the soda tax keeps working for all of us.

Recommendations 58 View of San Francisco Skyline from Bayview Hunters Point 3Executive Summary SAN FRANCISCO'S SUGARY DRINKS DISTRIBUTOR TAX (SDDT) In November 2016, San Francisco voters passed Proposition V, a tax on the distribution of sugar-sweetened beverages. Proposition V established a one-cent per fluid ounce fee on the distribution of sugar- sweetened beverages, syrups, and powders within the City and County of San Francisco. Rather than taxing consumers, the Sugary Drinks Distributor Tax (SDDT) is a tax on distributors for the privilege of conducting business within San Francisco. In addition to the SDDT, the legislation also established the Sugary Drinks Distributor Tax Advisory Committee (SDDTAC) made up 16 voting members that represent the diversity of San Francisco and are appointed by the City's Board of Supervisors, the Directors of four City departments/offices, and the San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD). The SDDTAC is charged with 1) making recommendations to the Mayor and Board of Supervisors on how to distribute the funds generated by SDDT; and 2) evaluating the effectiveness of those programs and agencies that received SDDT funding. SDDT is Decreasing Sales and Consumption of Sugar-Sweetened Beverages Annual SDDT revenues had already decreased prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the pandemic caused a dramatic drop in sales tax revenue\u2014raising the question if further decreases in SDDT revenue were due to reduced economic activity or due to the decrease of consumption of sugary drinks. Since the tax was implemented, SDDT revenue has decreased at more than twice the rate of sales tax revenue. Furthermore, sales tax revenue between Fiscal Years 2020-21 and 2021-22 has increased significantly as San Francisco has reopened and continues to recover, while SDDT revenue has only increased a small amount since the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. This decrease corresponds directly to a decrease in sugary drink sales and consumption. In addition to decreased SDDT revenues (reflecting decreased sales of sugar-sweetened beverages, or \"SSBs\"), there are now data on how resident consumption in priority neighborhoods has changed. A newly published peer-reviewed study1 looked at SSBs consumption for residents of specific ZIP codes in San Francisco and San Jos\u00e9 (which does not have a tax on sugary drinks) in the year prior to SDDT implementation (2017) and during the first two years that the sugary drinks tax was in effect. This study found BOTH that average daily SSB consumption decreased more in San Francisco compared to San Jos\u00e9 AND that the percentage of residents drinking at least 6 ounces of SSBs/day (\"high SSB consumers\") decreased. After two years of SDDT's implementation, there was a 34% decline in average daily SSB consumption (about 3.7oz less per day) among the San Francisco cohort. Additionally, the percentage of residents of priority ZIP codes who were \"high SSB consumers\" decreased from 37% pre-tax to 23% after 2 years of the sugary drinks tax.

Continue to direct funding to the neighborhoods most targeted by sugary drinks marketing and prioritized populations who are at highest risk of diet-sensitive chronic diseases. a. Additional data about SDDT revenue sources is critical to being able to make more precise recommendations about where funding should be directed. b. Analyze SF Health Network EMR records to explore effects of soda tax on health outcomes. c. Continue to work with City Controller to identify data (e.g., tax data) that could be used to focus funding. 2. Continue to direct funding to key strategies that work to achieve prioritized outcomes, especially those strategies that have long- lasting benefits (i.e., benefits that go beyond the funding period). a. Increase funding for economic development efforts (e.g., workforce development) - by increasing SDDT funding and/or by identifying other funding opportunities throughout the City and County of SF. b. Fund the conversion of designated Heat and Serve sites to 100% Refresh sites in SFUSD. c. Fund kitchen and warehouse facilities to allow SFUSD to become more self-reliant and decrease its dependence on outside vended meals to continue supporting increased student participation in healthy school lunches. d. Increase access to healthy foods through expanding the number of community food hubs and increasing funding for the Healthy Food Purchasing Supplement incentive programs (i.e. Vouchers4Veggies and Market Match). e. Increase funding for hydration stations. f. Increase funding for dental sealants specifically for low-income children, as they have proven to have long-lasting benefits in preventing cavities. 3. Continue to support SDDT-funded entities to a. implement multiple strategies, in order to maximize synergistic positive outcomes; b. strengthen and actively promote their organizational wellness policies; and c. ensure that all SDDT-funded entities promote drinking water and reduce sugary beverage consumption. 4. Continue to use multi-year grants to support emerging BIPOC-led organizations and mitigate structural barriers. 5. Work with other City entities to leverage additional funding opportunities that align with SDDT priorities. 6. Leverage funded entities' trusted relationships with impacted community members to increase participation in existing services and benefits, especially in assisting with CalFresh enrollment because of its significant role in addressing structural economic inequities. 7Overview of the Report In early 2020, the SDDTAC and San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) contracted with Raimi + Associates to conduct the evaluation of SDDT funding allocations. This report is the third evaluation report and presents evaluation findings for the programs and agencies that received SDDT funding for FY 2021-22. The report aligns with the 2020-2025 SDDTAC Strategic Plan (for more information, please see www.sfdph.org/sddtac). The report is organized into the following main sections: Introduction: Explains the background and purpose of SDDT and the SDDTAC, and describes the people and places more burdened by diet- sensitive chronic diseases. Findings #1-4: Presents the four main evaluation findings, and associated data and evidence, for the FY 2021-22. Recommendations: Outlines recommendations for consideration during future years of SDDT funding allocation. Data Sources This report presents both quantitative and qualitative evaluation data provided from SDDT-funded City agencies, SFUSD, and community- based grantees, as well as primary data collected through interviews with funded entities.

During the first (FY 2019-20) and second (FY 2020-21) years of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a decrease in both SDDT and sales tax revenues, and, then during the most recent FY 2021-22, there was an increase in both SDDT and sales tax revenues. However, SDDT revenue (a proxy for sugar-sweetened beverage sales and consumption) decreased more than sales tax AND has had a much smaller increase in the past year compared to the increase in sales tax revenue. Where Are We Now? Since the SDDT was implemented in January 2018, San Franciscans' purchasing and consumption of sugary drinks has decreased significantly ( ). Additionally, individual programs supported with SDDT funding have begun to demonstrate success in most other outcomes ( ). 10New Evidence that SDDT is Decreasing Sugar-Sweetened Beverage Consumption in Priority Neighborhoods In January 2023, a peer-reviewed article1 was published that presents the fundings from a 2017-2020 study on the impact of the San Francisco Sugary Drinks Distributor Tax (SDDT) on sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption in priority neighborhoods. This article was published in PLOS Global Public Health, an open access forum for public health research. Peer-reviewed articles present experiments, statistics, and other analyses that have been performed to a high technical standard with detailed descriptions and identify conclusions that are supported by the data - both of which are assessed by peer expert scholars and revised as necessary prior to publication. The article review process also ensures that published research meets all applicable standards for the ethics of experimentation and research integrity. STUDY DESIGN The study used surveys collected pre-tax (baseline) and in the 2 years after SDDT implementation from 721 San Francisco residents and 722 San Jos\u00e9 residents. San Jos\u00e9 was included as a control because they are demographically similar to San Francisco, but do not have a sugar-sweetened beverage tax in place. Surveys included a range of dietary questions, including participants daily intake of 15 specified beverage types (e.g., milks, alcohol, sweetened energy drinks, regular soda, diet beverages) and up to 5 additional beverages (e.g., horchata, kombucha, smoothies). Average SSB consumption was calculated based on the reported daily intake of regular soda, sweet tea, sweetened energy drinks, sweetened juice drinks, and qualifying \"other\" beverages. To assess impacts of the sugary drinks tax on populations more burdened by health inequities, participation was limited to adult residents of those ZIP codes with a high proportion of Black and Latino residents (which overlap with the neighborhoods that are identified as priority neighborhoods for SDDT). Approximately 65% of San Francisco's Black residents and 63% of Latino San Franciscans live in the nine San Francisco ZIP codes included in the study.

This chart shows how the tax revenue flows into the city and to the communities most targeted by the sugary drinks industry marketing and advertising tactics. 1. Sugary Drink Distributors are Taxed The SF Soda Tax is not a sales tax. Distributors are responsible for paying the tax. Merchants may choose to pass the cost of the tax along to consumers.2. Revenue is Collected The SF Soda Tax collects about $15-16 million each year. The revenue goes into the City's General Fund. About 22% is set aside for specific, voter- approved projects. The Tax Advisory Committee makes recommendations to the mayor on how to spend the remaining 78%. 3. Tax Committee Recommends Investments The Committee talks to community members to learn about how the tax revenue could benefit people,especially low- income people and people of color who are most targeted by the beverage industry's advertising. The Committee then submits their funding recommendations to the Mayor.4. City Budget Process Finalizes Investments The Mayor submits a budget proposal to the Board of Supervisors, including recommendations for the SF Soda Tax funds. The Board of Supervisors votes on the budget and the Mayor signs it. 5. SF Soda Tax Funds Programs! SF Soda Tax funds go to City departments who either implement programs and services directly or issue grants to community-based organizations to fund their important work. How it WorksSugary Drinks Distributor Tax (SDDT): Learn more at www.SodaTax-SF.org Community Input Introduction 12SDDT Advisory Committee Values Supporting community-led and culturally relevant work. Community-led work should be led by communities that are disproportionately impacted by marketing for and consumption of sugary beverages from the beverage industry and diet-sensitive chronic diseases (i.e., SDDTAC's priority populations), and culturally relevant work should be responsive to these communities and populations. This objective can be achieved by investing in priority communities and ensuring funded work is culturally responsive, linguistically relevant, and trauma informed. Building strong collaborations and partnerships to increase capacity and effectiveness. Funding should support existing and new community-based partnerships and collaborations that align resources to increase capacity, effectiveness, and the impact of strategies, programs, and services. Eliminating structural inequities and achieving equity. Equity (including health equity and racial equity) means that everyone has a fair and just chance to reach their full potential and be healthy. The root causes of structural inequities and health disparities (e.g., systems of oppression, intentionally and unintentionally/implicitly biased policies, and resource allocation) need to be addressed in order to achieve equity. This goal is done by mitigating health harms and holding the soda industry accountable. Prioritizing results and long-term impacts. Funding should support policy, systems, and environmental changes that include programming and go beyond programming, to change the structures in which we work, live, learn, and play. Adopting a Policy, Systems & Environmental (PSE) change approach can help create sustainable, comprehensive measures to improve community health, as well as enrich and expand the reach of current health preventive efforts and engage diverse stakeholders with the goal of improving health. Aerial view of Market Street in San Francisco 13BMAGIC kayaking activity 14Priority Populations Using public health data and evidence, the SDDTAC identified communities which are targeted by the soda industry, which consume sugary drinks at high rates, and which experience disproportionate levels of diet-sensitive chronic diseases. Diet-sensitive chronic diseases include tooth decay, cavities, obesity, Type 2 diabetes, hypertension (high blood pressure), and cardiovascular disease. Specifically, the SDDTAC identified the following populations as those which should be prioritized in SDDT funding recommendations: Low-income San Franciscans Children, youth, and young adults 0-24 years old Community members who identify as any of the following: >Asian >Black/African American >Latinx >Native American/Indigenous >Pacific Islander Although these priority populations are distinct, there is also considerable overlap between them, with many community members belonging to more than one of these communities and, thus, experiencing multiple intersecting and cumulative inequities. SDDT funds have been used to support programs within both community-based organizations and government agencies that focus on the neighborhoods and populations most impacted by diet-sensitive chronic diseases and other health inequities. Black/African American residents in their 30s and 40s are as likely to be hospitalized for diet-sensitive diseases as residents of other racial/ethnic groups who are older than 60.2 Black/African American residents who die from diabetes die 3-6 years younger than residents of other racial/ethnic groups who die from diabetes.3 2.

As part of the SDDTAC Strategic Plan, the SDDTAC identified key neighborhoods and population groups that should be prioritized in SDDT funding recommendations. Although SDDT-funded entities, as a group, supported work in every neighborhood across the city, data from this past FY 2021-22 demonstrate that services, programs, and education were focused in the neighborhoods most impacted by diet-sensitive chronic diseases. As shown in the map on the next page, SDDT-funded work occurred in every neighborhood and every supervisorial district in San Francisco. At the same time, SDDT-funded work was concentrated in the most impacted neighborhoods of the city (Bayview Hunters Point, Chinatown, Excelsior, Mission, Outer Mission, Potrero Hill, South of Market, Tenderloin/Civic Center, and Visitacion Valley). Moreover, SDDT funding has continued to support low-income San Franciscans; children, youth, and young adults; and community members who identify as Asian, Black/African American, Latinx, Native American/ Indigenous, and/or Pacific Islander.

Some SDDT-funded entities have multiple racial groups as their primary populations, which many serve residents of all racial/ethnic groups and do not have a focus on any specific racial group. The pie chart presents the FY 2021-22 SDDT funding allocated to those programs and organizations that have identified low-income residents/communities as their primary population. 89% Low-income community members as primary population served 10% SDDT implementation/ infrastructure (backbone support for SDDTAC, grantee convening and technical assistance, evaluation, etc.) 1% Pilot (Lactation Coalition, landscape analysis) 89%of SDDT funding supported programs focused on low-income residents Funding in this bar chart is not mutually exclusive because some funded entities identified multiple racial groups as their primary population. Multiple funded entities did not collect and/or submit race/ethnicity data for all of their participantsSDDT FY 2021-22 Funding Reached Priority People and Places Across SDDT-funded entities, residents from every neighborhood in the city were served by SDDT. At the same time, SDDT funds concentrated services, programs, and education in the neighborhoods most impacted by diet-sensitive chronic diseases and targeted by the sugar-sweetened beverage industry. As shown by the below table, the following neighborhoods received strategically concentrated amounts of in-person, culturally- responsive services from SDDT-funded entities. Culturally-responsive services are those that are shaped and informed by the languages, cultural practices, traditional knowledge, perspectives, and expressions reflective of the communities being served. Additionally, culturally-responsive services are often provided by staff with relevant lived experience and/or who are residents of the neighborhood they are serving. 24NeighborhoodsNeighborhoods where SDDT- funded entities offered in- person programming during FY 2021-22Neighborhoods where participants of FY 2021-22 programming livedNeighborhoods where people paid with SDDT funds live Bayview Hunters Point Chinatown Civic Center/the Tenderloin Excelsior Mission Outer Mission Potrero Hill South of Market Visitacion Valley SAN FRANCISCO NEIGHBORHOODS WITH THE HIGHEST BURDEN OF DIET-SENSITIVE CHRONIC DISEASE 49,850 people 24,132 students +(at minimum) participated in SDDT- funded grant programs were enrolled at schools supported with SDDT funds (46% of all enrolled SFUSD students) 25Location of Funded Programming and Services The dots represent places where: 1.

Therefore, these programs, services, and education are reaching residents throughout San Francisco. This past year, SDDT-funded entities were successful in providing services, programs, and education to children, youth, and young adults. In FY 2021- 22, 22% of participants were ages 0-24 years old, which is higher than the citywide percent of residents ages 0-24 (which is 20%)4. 4. U.S. Census Bureau.

Of the 251 people paid with SDDT funds, 192 (76%) were residents of San Francisco. This proportion (76%) is notably higher than the proportion of City and County of San Francisco employees who live in the city (42%)5. Additionally, of the 251 people paid with SDDT funds in FY 2021-22, the two largest racial/ethnic groups include Black/ African (34%) and Latinx (27%). These proportions (34% and 27%, respectively) are also notably higher than the percentages of City and County of San Francisco employees who identify as Black/African American (15%) and Latinx/Hispanic6. 5489 71 10 3 229 2Race/Ethnicity of People Paid SDDT Funds SDDT funds Since SDDT reporting began in FY2019-2020, there has been an increased number of people paid with SDDT funds who identify as Asian, Black/African American, and Latinx. Additionally, there has been a decreased number of people paid with SDDT funds who did not report their race/ethnicity.

Increase healthy messaging related to nutrition. Over the past three years, SDDT funding has supported many of these strategies through services, programs, and community education that focus on health education about nutrition, food security, and the negative effects of sugary drinks; opportunities for physical activity; preventive oral health services; and efforts that address the root causes of diet-sensitive chronic diseases.

All 25 SDDT-funded entities reported implementing Strategy 2: providing health promoting education, and specifically Activity 2.1: Providing health promoting education, programs, and services related to healthy eating (including beverages)/making nutritious choices. Despite the challenges of implementing structural changes, a majority of funded entities implemented Strategy 7 (for example, see impact on pages 23 and 31). Additionally, the evaluation team found that the majority of SDDT-funded entities (72%) implemented six or more strategies through the services, programs, and education that they offered in FY 2021-22.

All the cooking that comes with it has been pretty and easy to learn. My opinion on food has changed because I didn't realize it had such an impact on our mental health. We associate food with happiness and sadness and the foods we eat release chemicals in the brain that make us feel these things. There's a lot more to food than just cooking and eating it. Food affects our environment, health, culture, and I think we should learn about how it affects us.\" -Student, Balboa High School, Snack Squad/HiFY Job training at Farming Hope 34Implementing Multiple Strategies has Synergistic Benefits Rather than focus on a single strategy, the services, programs, and community education provided by SDDT-funded entities often implement multiple strategies at one time. For example, as explained in the quote below, the Snack Squad/HiFY program at SFUSD high schools not only increases access to healthy food, but also provides health promoting education and healthy messaging related to nutrition as well as building the leadership capacity of San Francisco youth. In addition to the health promotion programming, SDDT-funded entities also provide a variety of job readiness and skill training to both program participants and people paid using SDDT funds. A review of SDDT-funded entity data reveals that SDDT funds are being distributed to program participants and people who predominantly identify as Asian, Black, and/or Latinx and live in San Francisco. Many of the program participants are also residents of neighborhoods most impacted by diet-sensitive chronic diseases. For these reasons, SDDT funding is effectively supporting job training and professional development as well as increasing the economic opportunities for priority populations. 76 (30%) only received a stipend or were paid with SDDT funds 175 (70%) received job training in addition to being paid with SDDT funds 35Of the people paid who received job-training, 162 (93%) identified as Asian, Black/African American, Latinx, Native American/ Indigenous, and/or Pacific Islander Of the people who were only paid with SDDT funds, 60 (79%) identified as Asian, Black/ African American, Latinx, Native American/ Indigenous, and/or Pacific Islander Of the people who were only paid with SDDT funds, 50 (66%) were San Francisco residents.

Interviewees also described that the multiyear grant created the stability to establish needed organizational infrastructure and new programming to sustain their work (e.g., hiring, fundraising, outreach, and long-term planning). \" \"SDDT funding and the flexibility to shift meant everything because we were able to bring our staff on as employees rather than contractors ...there was deep safety and peace of mind knowing that my staff have health benefits [especially as many were/are directly exposed to COVID]. If they get sick, they could still get money and take care of themselves and their family. Without SDDT funding, we couldn't...have made that shift.\" That was a big deal. We could professionalize right away, get serious about our plans, and get employee number three. It's not a tremendously large amount of our budget now, because we're now a two-and-a-half million dollar a year operation. But there's no way we would have grown this fast without this kind of commitment early on. \" Then Supervisor Matt Haney at Kain Na grand opening 38Groups presenting key messages during focus group at IFRBEET's program graduation event from Community Grows 39Rather than issuing small grants that require an annual competitive renewal process, the SDDT funding approach is responsive to historic and structural inequities by providing larger, multiyear grants that reduce significant administrative burden and allow funded entities to focus on their work. In alignment with the goals and values identified in the SDDTAC Strategic Plan, the SDDT multiyear funding is effectively being directed to BIPOC-led and BIPOC-serving organizations in key neighborhoods\u2014in other words, the people and places most burdened by the sugary drinks industry. According to interviewees, SDDT's strategic investment in BIPOC-led and BIPOC-serving organizations catalyzed transformative leadership within and across organizations, leading to increased stability and effectiveness. \" \"It's anti racist work to have multiyear contracts because we know that those [small community-connected] nonprofit agencies in the City are all run by people of color. [The typical City contracting process and single year funding] makes it so difficult for [organizations] to receive their funds... [The typical funding process is] creating inequality and inequity...[And] you know whatever millions of dollars we're getting [from SDDT funds] is supposed to go back to the community that is affected, which is people of color...\" We've been recently exploring and working as more of a collective and removing some of the hierarchy that has been in our organization for a while. Instead of an executive director, we have two co-directors. We split the role, which is working so much better, because not one person is holding everything...It's a group of folks instead of just one person knowing all of that information and making decisions. And we are also [using] a consent model.\"Interviewees also noted that the health and economic disparities exacerbated by the pandemic led funded entities to focus explicitly on eliminating racism and other root causes of these disparities. They explained that SDDT funding allowed them to deepen their work in impacted communities and support community capacity building: Increase language access, outreach to priority populations, and connections; Provide programs that are culturally rooted and based on community-generated evidence, supporting a culture of health and prevention; Prioritize hearing directly from community members about what works best and adjust programming; Center community members as subject matter experts and natural leaders; Ensure leadership represented diverse demographics and lived experience of communities served; Focus on hiring people for staff positions with similar socioeconomic experiences as communities served. Interviewees described a range of ways that SDDT funding supported community capacity building, including supporting funded entities to: Increase opportunities for personal and professional job skills training and development; Promote staff and community members to positions of increased leadership; Open opportunities for mentoring and career advising.\"People join the program based on being interested, but also knowing that they're actually getting job skills training...and getting paid to do that. They're also receiving workshops on financial literacy and how to manage their budget. We have resources to fill out letters of recommendation for future jobs or for college applications. It isn't just another class, but something that feels more connected to the real world...\" 40\"We have a mom who went through college and was working with us the whole time she was going. She just got her degree from San Francisco State as a social worker. We have another person on staff who is also a mom and is part-time but we're training her in a new position. She's going to be our outreach manager.\"Finally, many interviewees of funded entities explained how multiyear SDDT funding deepened movements of resistance to oppression, and contributed to an increased sense of place, community, and power. Funded entities utilized SDDT funds to deepen efforts working with communities to organize and build movements of resistance to oppression via education focused on supporting collaborations, systems change efforts, and practical tools. Funded partners explained that their SDDT grants supported them to: Reduce isolation experienced by providers disconnected from mainstream systems; Build coalitions with other SDDT-funded entities, for example, to advocate for and restore funding for food security; Engage in partnerships with neighborhood-specific groups and organizations; Join statewide collaboratives to share their learnings. 41Finding 4 Within the last three years, SDDT has funded structural interventions that have resulted in an increase in healthy behaviors. 4243Vouchers4Veggies food vouchersVegetable stall at Heart of the City Farmer's Market 44IN ADDITION TO FUNDING CULTURALLY-RESPONSIVE PROGRAMS, SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, SDDT REVENUES ARE ALSO DEDICATED TO FUNDING STRUCTURAL CHANGES.Structural Changes Structural changes intervene in the policies and systemic practices that shape where we live, learn, work, and play\u2014and therefore have the potential to interrupt inequities and create healthier opportunities.7 Decades of public health research have demonstrated that structural changes that address the social determinants of health also improve health outcomes for communities, resulting in much larger and more sustainable impacts than individually-focused health promotion or medical interventions.8,9 Despite their large impact, structural changes that increases inequity often require significant effort to implement and also typically require longer periods of time to see measurable health improvements (relative to individually- focused health promotion or medical interventions).10 7.

This year's evaluation data further illustrates that SDDT funding for structural interventions (in past years) has resulted in increased healthy behaviors. Specifically, data from FY 2021-22 demonstrates that SDDT's prior and current investments in structural changes through SFUSD's Student Nutrition Services, hydration stations, the Healthy Food Purchasing Supplement program, and community food hubs have led to important positive changes in access to healthy food, access to water, and improved nutritional behaviors. Through these interventions, SDDT funding has invested in structural changes that address long-standing inequities by increasing access to healthy foods and reducing economic barriers to healthy eating. In addition, healthy behaviors resulting from these investments have continued after the initial investment in facility improvements and after voucher recipients stop participating in the program. Salem Market healthy corner store 45Social Determinants of Health The social determinants of health are a broad range of socioeconomic and environmental factors that influence health outcomes at the individual and community levels.11 Examples of social determinants of health include air and water quality, economic opportunities, access to healthy foods, and protections against institutionalized forms of racism and discrimination. As a result of structural inequities, people from historically disenfranchised populations and neighborhoods encounter barriers to good health, such as a lack of access to healthy foods, that influence their health behaviors and, thus, affect their health outcomes. 11.

As a result of SDDT investments, many SFUSD middle and high schools began to transition to the Refresh model in Spring 2020 and are now able to prepare healthy school meals with fresh and mostly local ingredients. Structural Interventions that Result in Healthy Behaviors Winter 2019 to Spring 2020: Leveraging SDDT funding, school kitchen improvements were made at many SFUSD middle and high schools. March 2020: COVID-19 pandemic shelter-in-place started. SFUSD transitions to distance-learning. July 2021: SFUSD begins to offer free school meals to all students regardless of income. August 2021: In-person learning resumes at all SFUSD schools. SFUSD SNS has two main models for their school kitchens: 1) Heat and Serve, and 2) Refresh. Heat & Serve is the traditional model in which schools are reliant on pre-made meals, because they have limited-to-no kitchen space and have outdated/inadequate equipment. In FY 2021-22, the Heat & Serve model was used at all elementary schools as well as smaller middle and high schools. Refresh is the newer model in which schools prepare meals on site from scratch, because they have dedicated kitchen space and upgraded facilities (e.g., new equipment and serving lines) and their dining staff have received professional development trainings. In FY 2021-22, the Refresh model was used at larger middle and high schools. There are two sub-sets of Refresh schools: >Partial Refresh schools prepare only some meals on site. As of fall 2021, five middle schools and ten high schools had adopted the 100% Refresh model. >100% Refresh schools prepare all meals on site. As of fall 2021, four middle schools had adopted the 100% Refresh model. Regional Kitchen. Additionally, SNS also has a regional kitchen at McAteer that adopted the Refresh model and prepares meals from scratch for SFUSD's early education sites throughout the city. 12. SFUSD. 2023.

To explore the estimated participation of low-income students15 who eat free lunches at SFUSD, the evaluation team conducted an analysis at the 100% Refresh middle schools and Heat & Serve middle schools. As shown by the below chart, in FY 2021-22, at least half of students at Heat & Serve middle schools are low-income, but only about 28% of students participate in school lunches. In contrast, at the 100% Refresh middle schools, more students are participating in school lunches. This difference is particularly illuminating since schools meals are now free at all schools. Therefore, this data suggests that the 100% Refresh program is better reaching and motivating low-income students to participate in lunch than the traditional Heat & Serve model.

Because students' household income is used to determine eligibility for the federal Free and Reduced Price Meal (FRPM) program, this is widely used as an estimate for the proportion of students who are low-income. Although all public school students in California are able to receive free school meals without documenting their household income, school districts are nonetheless required to track and report these data in order to receive partial reimbursement for school meals from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Traditionally, there has been higher participation at elementary schools, and lower participation at middle and high schools. In fall 2019 and fall 2021, Heat & Serve elementary and K-8 schools had higher participation in lunch than at middle and high schools. However, between fall 2019 and fall 2021, Refresh schools saw the greatest increase in student participation in lunch meals. The increase in participation at Refresh schools in fall 2021 translated to 2,223 more students who ate healthy lunches at Refresh schools every day compared to fall 2019; even despite decreased enrollment district-wide.Additionally, the 100% Refresh subset of middle schools saw an even greater increase in school meal participation. Between fall 2019 and fall 2021, the 100% Refresh middle schools more than doubled their student participation in healthy lunch meals from 26% to 58%. As shown by the chart below, 100% Refresh middle schools had the greatest change in lunch participation compared to any other type of middle and high school SNS kitchen model. These data suggest that the consistency of fresh and healthy meals offered every day at 100% Refresh middle schools motivates a larger proportion of students to take advantage of school meals than the equivalent group of students at other middle and high schools. School lunch options at a 100% Refresh site 4920,803 2,47446% of SFUSD students 855 Students served by Refresh kitchens (but no SDDT- funded hydration stations) Student at sites with SDDT hydration stations (but not served by Refresh)(24,132 students) attend public, non-charter schools benefiting from SDDT- funded structural changes Students at sites both served by Refresh and with SDDT-funded hydration stationsSDDT's investment in FY2019-2020 to support the infrastructure needed to transition SFUSD schools to the Refresh model, especially the 100% Refresh model, has resulted in a large increase in student participation in healthy school lunches in FY 2021-22. In other words, the early investment in structural and environmental changes at SFUSD schools has led to a delayed, yet significant, payoff that is now providing large positive nutritional benefits through increased fruit/vegetable consumption and reduced food insecurity. In order for SDDT to continue to positively impact a large number of students and residents, future investments should similarly be allocated to structural and environmental changes. + + =SDDT FUNDING REACHES LARGE NUMBERS OF SFUSD STUDENTSWater bottle filling station at school 50HYDRATION STATIONS SDDT funding has also increased the number of SFUSD water hydration stations, where students, school employees, and school visitors can refill water bottles. SFUSD used SDDT funds allocated in FY 2018- 2019 to install new hydration stations at 12 SFUSD schools. Seven of the SDDT-funded stations were additions or upgrades at SFUSD Early Education School sites. Stations were also installed at Hilltop High School (a continuation/opportunity school), two middle schools, and two elementary schools. In FY 2021-22, 57% of students at the schools with SDDT-funded hydration stations were low-income compared to 46% of all SFUSD students. Of the SDDT-funded hydration stations in SFUSD, eight (67%) are located in neighborhoods most or moderately impacted by diet-sensitive chronic diseases (although the other sites also serve residents of SDDT priority neighborhoods). Through this environmental intervention, SDDT is increasing the availability of filtered and temperature-regulated water and providing students with a free and convenient alternative to sugar-sweetened beverages. Peer-reviewed research has found that installing hydration stations increases water consumption among children and youth16 and that adequate hydration significantly improves cognitive function among children and youth.17,18 By investing in this structural intervention, SDDT is improving access to drinking water among students. 16.

Of these, 12 (55%) are in SDDT priority neighborhoods most impacted by diet-sensitive chronic diseases (i.e., Tenderloin, Mission, Bayview Hunters Point, Visitacion Valley, Excelsior, Outer Mission), and two moderately impacted neighborhoods (i.e., Bernal Heights and Crocker Amazon). Vendor at Heart of the City Farmer's Market 52HEALTHY FOOD PURCHASING SUPPLEMENT When people do not have the resources to meet basic needs, they are forced to make hard decisions, often between food, childcare, transportation, and housing costs. The Healthy Food Purchasing Supplement (HFPS) is a grant program that provides monthly stipends to low-income households to extend their limited food budgets and to increase access to healthy foods. In San Francisco, the two HFPS funded programs are Vouchers4Veggies and Market Match. Vouchers4Veggies is operated by EatSF and it provides $20-$40 per month, based on household size, in fruit and vegetable vouchers for six months. Participants can redeem vouchers at local food retailers including corner stores, grocery stores, and farmers markets. Market Match is operated by the Heart of the City Farmers Market (HOTC) and it provides $10-$40 per month in incentives to match participants' use of their CalFresh nutrition assistance benefits at HOTC. During FY 2021-22, people unduplicated people received Vouchers4Veggies .19 Both HFPS programs are examples of structural interventions that increase access to healthy food options that low- income residents have in San Francisco. By helping low-income residents to regularly integrate fruits and vegetables into their diet, HFPS programs have been shown to change long-term healthy nutritional behaviors and, thus, address health inequities.20,21 For example, a recent evaluation of the Vouchers4Veggies program found that on average participants consumed one additional serving of fruits and vegetables per day 3-6 months after having stopped receiving Vouchers4Veggies compared to before they started on the program.22\"When you start a habit, if you keep up with it, then it's easier to stick to that diet...so that's what I'm trying to do. [The vouchers] help me stick to these healthy eating habits.\" -Vouchers4Veggies program participant 19. These numbers represent all San Franciscans who received support from Healthy Food Purchasing Supplements, which are funded by both SDDT and General Fund allocations from the City & County of San Francisco. 20.

The visualizations below depict the monthly expenses and the gap in food purchasing ability for a family of 3 (1 adult, 1 teenager, 1 school-age child). The University of Washington's Center for Women's Welfare defines the Self-Sufficiency Standard as the income needed to meet a minimum yet adequate level, taking into account family composition, ages of children, and geographic differences in costs23. Based on the Self-Sufficiency Standard, $9,474 is the income required for a single parent with two children to meet basic needs in San Francisco. As shown below, a family in which the parent works one full-time job and earns the San Francisco minimum wage is unable to meet all basic monthly expenses. CalFresh subsidies and food vouchers serve a critical role in closing the gap in a household's food budget. However, although food subsidies are beneficial, they may not cover the family's full food expenses; the family must either spend less on food or forego other essential expenses, such as rent and healthcare. 23.

A recent economic analysis found that every $1 dollar invested in HFPS programs leads to an additional $3 in economic activity to the local economy.24 For example, HFPS programs in San Francisco support healthy corner stores in low- income communities, which are mostly BIPOC-owned and located in the Tenderloin and Bayview Hunters Point, to increase their fresh produce sales. Additionally, HFPS supports small and mostly BIPOC farmers from the Bay Area and beyond in successfully selling their produce at HOTC and, thus, increase their farm's economic stability. \"We [HOTC] are a farmer operated, non-profit farmers market. Over 50% of the farmers are people of color. Over 50% of the farmers that we serve speak a language other than English primarily at home... During this last year, it is irrefutable that without the Healthy Food Purchasing Supplement and the additional customer foot traffic, we don't know if the market would have survived the impact of the pandemic... For most of our farmers, the majority of their income is from this program.

By partnering with the SF-Marin Food Bank and the Deep Medicine Circle, Kain Na is able to offer free healthy and culturally-responsive foods to 150 households on a weekly basis. In contrast to traditional food pantries with rigid schedules and/or pre-packaged boxes, Kain Na focuses on self-determination and the dignity of program participants by providing flexible hours and offering participants the ability to choose the amount and type of fresh produce and foods they receive. A central tenet of Kain Na is to increase food access through multi-culturalism and inclusion. Kain Na (pronounced kah- een nah) is the Tagalog phrase for \"Let's eat\" and is often used in the Philippines as a welcoming invitation to share a meal. Developed by BIPOC leaders, Kain Na centers inclusion through murals that highlight Mission Bay's multiculturalism, cookbooks and pamphlets that are culturally-responsive, and a multifunctional space that is used for food and nutrition classes, CalFresh outreach, tax assistance, eviction defense resources, and other essential community needs.Kain Na team member stocking produceBok choy and cucumber at Kain Na 57 This holistic approach to addressing food insecurity closely aligns with SDDT's core values of investing in priority communities through work that is culturally responsive, linguistically relevant, and trauma informed. SDDT's investment in Kain Na is a promising practice of a structural intervention that directly addresses long-standing inequities by increasing regular access to healthy foods which improves long-term nutritional behaviors. \"If a participant can't make it one day to get their weekly food, they can visit the hub on the other days it's open. This reduces anxiety and fear of scarcity, making the food hub a positive shopping experience...It gives participant the choice to pick the food they need to feed themselves and their families.\" -Tina Gonzales, SF-Marin Food Bank, Director of Community PartnershipsRecommendations 1. Continue to direct funding to the neighborhoods most targeted by sugary drinks marketing and prioritized populations who are at highest risk of diet-sensitive chronic diseases. a. Additional data about SDDT revenue sources is critical to being able to make more precise recommendations about where funding should be directed. b. Analyze SF Health Network EMR records to explore effects of soda tax on health outcomes. c. Continue to work with City Controller to identify data (e.g., tax data) that could be used to focus funding. 2. Continue to direct funding to key strategies that work to achieve prioritized outcomes, especially those strategies that have long- lasting benefits (i.e., benefits that go beyond the funding period). a. Increase funding for economic development efforts (e.g., workforce development) - by increasing SDDT funding and/or by identifying other funding opportunities throughout the City and County of SF. b. Fund the conversion of designated Heat and Serve sites to 100% Refresh sites in SFUSD. c. Fund kitchen and warehouse facilities to allow SFUSD to become more self-reliant and decrease its dependence on outside vended meals to continue supporting increased student participation in healthy school lunches. d. Increase access to healthy foods through expanding the number of community food hubs and increasing funding for the Healthy Food Purchasing Supplement incentive programs (i.e. Vouchers4Veggies and Market Match). e. Increase funding for hydration stations. f. Increase funding for dental sealants specifically for low-income children, as they have proven to have long-lasting benefits in preventing cavities. Produce vendor at Heart of the City Farmer's Market 583. Continue to support SDDT-funded entities to a. implement multiple strategies, in order to maximize synergistic positive outcomes; b. strengthen and actively promote their organizational wellness policies; and c. ensure that all SDDT-funded entities promote drinking water and reduce sugary beverage consumption. 4. Continue to use multi-year grants to support emerging BIPOC-led organizations and mitigate structural barriers. 5. Work with other City entities to leverage additional funding opportunities that align with SDDT priorities. 6. Leverage funded entities' trusted relationships with impacted community members to increase participation in existing services and benefits, especially in assisting with CalFresh enrollment because of its significant role in addressing structural economic inequities.
