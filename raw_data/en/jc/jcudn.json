The tool allows the user to change a number of the input variables, e.g. NPK, sprays and energy costs Provides an overall gross margin \u0083UK Straw Availability CSL were commissioned by NNFCC to undertake a simple mass balance analysis of the current production and use of agricultural straw sources in Great Britain.Fuels and Energy Projects In support of the IBS projec t, NNFCC commissioned North Energy to establish the envir onmental savings for several configurations incl. logistics and feedstock preparation of a UK based fuel plant. The configurations include: \u0083Feedstock type including dieselFuels and Energy Projects \u0083Assessment of economic of new AD production technologies. Includes a down loadable cost calculator for estimating costs of anaerobic digestion (AD) facilities. \u0083In the process of carryi ng out a Advanced Biofuels Roadmapping project for UK Government. Delphi approach Driver is to identify top ten barriers to the development of thermochemical biofuels and provide recommendations as to how advanced fuel production can be catalysed in the UK. \u0083A review of technologies for the gasification of biomass and wastes in the UK \u0083An evaluation of opportunities for converting indigenous UK wastes to fuels and energy.
