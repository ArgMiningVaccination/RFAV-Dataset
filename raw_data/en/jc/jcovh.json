One such condition is a [fatty liver](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/fatty-liver-diet-chart) or collection of fat in the liver. The buildup of fats in the liver is known as Fatty Liver. The liver processes everything that you eat or drink and filters harmful substances from the blood. If too much fat has accumulated in the liver, this process gets interfered with. These fat cells cause inflammation of the liver tissues which in time can lead to scarring and liver fibrosis. On its own, a fatty liver is relatively harmless, but when it reaches this stage, it can be life threatening. The reasons for Fatty Liver can be [alcoholism](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/treatment-for-alcoholism), incorrect [diet](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/healthy-diet), [obesity](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/obesity-diet-chart), [diabetes](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/diabetes), or even excess use of medication. If ignored or left untreated, many liver diseases will lead to permanent and irreversible damage to the liver and can be a significant threat to your health. But, there is no standard form of treatment for a fatty liver. If diagnosed in its early stages, treating the underlying cause can stop the progression of the disease and even resolve it. Homeopathy addresses the underlying causes of a disease and hence is an ideal form of treatment for a fatty liver. It can reduce the symptoms of this disease, improve liver functioning and even reverse the condition if treatment is started early. The Homeopathic medicines, which are made of natural substances, are given to patients after studying the unique symptoms experienced by each individual. Homeopathy is one of the most popular holistic systems of medicine. The selection of remedy is based upon the theory of individualization and symptoms similarity by using holistic approach. Homoeopathy is very proficient in managing all the symptoms of Fatty liver disease and furthermore plays a vital role in preventing relapse of the condition. Some of the most common homeopathic medicines for fatty liver are - Chelidonium: This is often used to treat a fatty liver accompanied by right upper [abdominal pain](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/abdominal-pain).
