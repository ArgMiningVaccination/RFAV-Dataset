Color is killer as well. Cassie T. Best fit of leggings that I have found. The material is so soft Cindy E. Soft, fit well....feel great! Jeinny L. Love Love Love These leggings, i bought another pair in another color. True to size Blair D. Good material, I love any black leggings. Kari Love the fit and color ways of these leggings!! I wear them for almost every workout. I am 5'3\" with a thicker lower body and wear an xs Michele After being a celestial bodiez customer since the beginning, I've been reluctant to try just ANY leggings. The fact that Celeste was promoting this brand was inticing! Im extremely happy with these leggings and the bras I purchased. The leggings fit like a glove, I can rock a medium at 5'10 and a muscular 183lb frame. I'll definitely be stocking up on more items very soon! Rebecca Leak I am AMAZED at the quality, fit and softness of these leggings. I want 1000 pairs and to wear them all the time. I am about 5'5 117lbs waist 27\" and Hips 33\". I am normally a size small in bottoms but I sized down and they fit perfectly! The length is exactly right too. Emily Soft AF True to size. They are definitely more fitted in the leg than around my waist and they tend to roll down if I wear them for leg day so I stick to wearing these on upper body days for that reason. The color and feel are great and I like that they make mah legs look beefy lol. Giusy I was looking for this type of leggins since ever!!!I had to give a try and buy them and I am really happy with my choive. In my advice, they fit a bit bigger then other leggins, so if you are usually an M size, go for a S. The quality is super, soft and strech. No see through, squat approved. Not tight in waisf.. And not to high waist. I ordered two colors but I like better the Grey blue. Only bad thing was that unfortunately I had to pay taxes (euro 13,00) extra when I received the pack...

I love sizing down to xxs bc I like my leggings fitting tight and it's so buttery soft! one of the best pair of leggings I own, I honestly only ever wear these to the gym. The leggings fit right at the ankle Hope SO soft and buttery! Literally one of my favorite pair of leggings. The colors are so vibrant, I love it! Katie These leggings are so soft and comfortable. I really like that they don't have a thick seam at the top of the waistband so they don't punch at all. I do wish that they were just a tad bit more high wasted and I wish they had POCKETS (my number 1 recommendation) I'll forever be waiting for the day that the pocket shorts come in legging form. Cheri I found these at the Wodapalooza event. These ladies were awesome. Once I got home I ordered 2 more pair. One thing I would suggest if your into CrossFit or HITT workouts size down for a slightly tighter fit. These are squat proof and the fabric is so comfortable. Very very comparable to the big brands. Carey Ehhh... My original order of these were delayed because of them over selling then refunding with a gift card on Black Friday, so I had to wait until they restocked months later to get them. Then shipping took FOREVER. Honestly, before even putting them on, the material feels very thin. Once I put them on, they are fitting around your legs but loose around the waist. I decided to give them a try through my workout and I had to constantly pull them up. Very uncomfortable fit and will end up being the pair of leggings that end up at the back of your drawer and never wear again. Very disappointed. Katy B. I absolutely love them!! And so does my boyfriend *wink wink they fit perfectly! Martha T.H. wanted to thank you for the quality leggings. Oh yeah did I mention how well they fit. You guys rock. thank you Candi M. Best leggings I have ever worn. They feel smooth like butter on. Perfect fit! Just love them! Candi M. Best Leggings Best leggings I have ever worn. They feel smooth like butter on. Perfect fit! Just love them! Ali The material is super compressive and thick which I like. I ordered a medium and I'm 147lb 5'3\". They are pretty tight in my butt and thighs and loose on the waist which isn't ideal. Will definitely have to keep pulling them up if I'm workout in them. Alice These are, by far, my favorite leggings! They feel so buttery and compliment my body so well. For reference, I'm 4'11\" and 124lbs. They're squat proof, so they're perfect for lifting, yoga, bouldering, etc. which is hard to find. I'll definitely be expanding my collection with my next paycheck! Christina I love these leggings but I am disappointed that they are so short. Im 5'9 and thin so I have to wear a small. The leggings go about 5 inches above my ankle. I wish they would have longer versions in small. Some of us skinny girls are tall lol Michelle Rather disappointed with these leggings. The fit was weird and felt off. They were quite soft but wasn't a fan of the fabric. S.T. Quickly became my favorites.. now I have almost every color. They're the perfect combo of stretchy and compressive, thin enough that they don't restrict range of motion but thick enough that they're not see through. Great for running, spinning, lifting, yoga, etc. The best part though is FSO's customer service. Super responsive and resolve things quickly. Customer service makes or breaks whether I'll shop somewhere and they do an awesome job. Thanks Free Spirit!! Christine Carroll These leggings are great quality but for some reason the sizing of the black leggings seem to run smaller than the other colors I have. I ordered a small, just as my other two pairs in different colors are, and I should've ordered a medium. You could say it's a fluke but I ordered two black pairs and they are both the same. Alyse Not a fan of wearing leggings when I do legs...but I did today and WOW they are not too tight, super soft and they don't move when you squat. I am 5'10\" and went with a medium. Will definitely be buying more! Alyse AMAZING Not a fan of wearing leggings when I do legs...but I did today and WOW they are not too tight, super soft and they don't move when you squat. I am 5'10\" and went with a medium. Will definitely be buying more! Veronica I love these leggings! I need them in every color! They are buttery soft, true to size, squat proof. These are my new favorite leggings. Dania I could wear these all day every day. Very comfy. I like that they don't compress so hard on my stomach. I'm 5'4, 162, with thick thighs. I ordered a medium. Mild sliding so I'm ordering a small. SJ Everything and more! Size 6-8 always hard for me to find leggings that are true high waist. They are snug enough at the top to stay up and comfortable stretch if you are thicker in butt/thighs. They are the breathable thin without being see through or feeling exposed bending over. I typically would be S-M. Felt too right when I first tried on but great compression and comfortable through my whole workout. Broke them in with a 2 mile run warm up too and I did not have to adjust at all! Nadirah THIS COMPANY CONTINUES TO SUPPORT RACIST @HAILEYBAKOS . THERE IS A VIDEO OF HER MAKING A \"JOKE\" ABOUT BLACK MEN ! SHE HAS REPEATEDLY CALLED BLACK MEN THE N WORD AND NEVER APOLOGIZED OR OWNED UP TO IT. THERE IS A VIDEO ON TWITTER. I WILL BE GLADLY SPREADING THIS NEWS TO OTHER SOURCES AND PEOPLE UNTIL SOMETHING IS DONE. I WILL NOT BE GIVING SUPPORT TO A COMPANY THAT SUPPORTS RACISTS AND RACISM. SHAMEFUL!!!!

I got the Moon color and I love it especially with the black streamline bra I ordered with it, beautiful combo! The leggings are the perfect length, did not move at all when I walked and ran in them and are so comfy and soft! They do not look like they will pill as some soft leggings do so that is awesome. This was my first order from them and I will definitely be buying more colors! These are better than lululemon for sure and I have a lot of their leggings, I'll be switching to Free Spirt now!

Linsey K. when i first bought from this brand my usual size is a size M but with these leggings because they are so soft and buttery and on the thinner side, you may need to size down. i emailed them and told them that i had to keep pulling them up and the crotch area was slightly baggy which is not cute lol. they informed me that i may have got the wrong size. i asked if i could exchange to a size small and they fit like a glove. no baggy crotch and i dont pull them up. also the exchange process was very easy and hassle free which is big for me. most companies cant keep up with their customer service. plus i think i read on their IG they have like 6 people working for their company? so thats awesome its easy.

I read the reviews and decided to size down to XS for the balance legging, and I'm glad I did! They definitely fit better. I am exchanging the leggings for a different color because the Reyes (emerald) color was not nearly as \"emerald\" as the photo. Darker than expected. I'm hoping I'll like the new pair!

Definitely not purchasing again Danni Bryson I will say these leggings are super soft and comfortable at first however they do NOT stay up. I didn't even try to work out in them because walking alone was uncomfortable feeling like my leggings wouldn't stay up and to be honest.. a saggy butt.

Aisha I ordered these leggings along with the scrunch hoodie. The leggings were too small for me so I contacted customer service and they were nothing but helpful to me! They were all sold out of of the black I originally purchased in my next size up, so they really helped out by holding one for me in the next color I'd love. They walked me through how to do the exchange. They were in contact with me the whole way letting me know they received my leggings and were sending out the new ones. I just got today and they are perfect. Best service I've had in a long time, will continue shopping with them. Aisha Amazing service I ordered these leggings along with the scrunch hoodie.

Marta Got the Lo-fit in red and I love the color and the feel of the leggings, they really flaunt the tush. I was told to size down (usually a small and bought XS), however I wish I sized down to an XXS since they slide off during sprints. Will purchase more colors in smaller size. Marta Need more!!

Nicole These are not made for girls with a booty or thick legs. I ordered a small, my normal size, and what was on the size chart. They are too small in the legs and butt, but big in the waist so I am constantly pulling them up. They also seem more cropped than ankle length on me. They are not as high waisted as I would prefer because of the sizing issue. If I had sized up they would be way too big in the waist. Expected more from a $50+ pair of leggings. For reference I am 5'6\", 145lbs, athletic build. 27.5in waist, 40in hips, 22.5in thighs. Nicole Cute and soft but sizing issue These are not made for girls with a booty or thick legs.

But come with some sizing issues for me, personally. When I put the built in crop on, the girls popped the top seam, so now there is a hole right on the top V. I usually wear a medium in most other brands, but would need to size up for future reference. And with the leggings, I definitely needed to size down, I'm constantly pulling them up, making the two I have more suitable for lounge pants than workout pants. Just have to keep this in mind because I did really like the look and would probably order again with different sizes. Haley Good but What I ordered was super cute!

They're that good. They look great and they feel great, stay in place, and are true to size. The fabric does tend to gather a bit of lint, but nothing a cheap lint roller can't fix. I'd highly recommend! Jenny Benitez Came back for seconds! I just ordered a second pair of the lo-fi (black) leggings. They're that good.

Sasha These leggings are soo comfy! Super buttery. My only complaints are that they do not hide cellulite at all, unfortunately. And as mentioned below, I sized down and still find myself hiking the pants up. I think I could get away with sizing down x2. With all that said, I own 6 pairs and they are in heavy rotation. Free spirit leggings are all I wear anymore and I am excited to buy more of their products. Sasha Super comfortable These leggings are soo comfy! Super buttery.

I own a bunch of lululemon (size 2) and beyond yoga leggings (size XXS and XS) and I like these more - they are so soft, flattering, perfectly high waisted, hit right at my ankle, don't sag or need to be pulled up during intense workouts, and are not see-through at all. I initially ordered two XXS pairs (for reference I'm 5'3\", 105lbs, 25\" waist, 34\" hip) to try out and love them so much I'm immediately ordering more colors. I did a test HIIT workout before reordering to make sure they stayed put and didn't show sweat - they completely stayed put and didn't slip at all which was great. Unfortunately, they do seem to show sweat, which is the only reason this is a 4 star review and not 5. However, its not horribly noticeable and I love everything else about these leggings so much I'm still buying more. Marissa Favorite Leggings! I LOVE these leggings!

However, I find myself hiking them up a lot (maybe I just prefer a tighter fit in the crotch area and I don't think a size smaller would work) and I'm a little upset because I've only worn mine twice and they're already fraying at the seams.

I would compare these to Lulu's and say they are right there with them. They are soft and buttery. High waisted and fit really good. A tad thicker than LL's, but just as comfy. For size reference, I am 5'1\", 125 LBS and ordered a Small. I do have a pair of mediums, but those tend to fall down through out the day. At first they will seem really tighter, but they do stretch out after a few wares. I have searched high and low for Lululemon's at a cheaper price and these are IT! Jboe.
