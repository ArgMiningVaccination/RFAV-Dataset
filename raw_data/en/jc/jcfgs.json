Women's healthcare professionals are commonly faced with questions about breast cancer risk estimation, options for average risk screening, supplemental screening in women with dense breast tissue, and high-risk management strategies. It's therefore important for healthcare professionals to understand the basics of breast cancer genetics and the guidelines for the management of patients with hereditary cancer predisposition and have the confidence to communicate information and recommendations for risk management. This course will reinforce these key points in breast care and will provide a comprehensive, practical approach to addressing breast health, personalized risk assessment, and risk management. "}
