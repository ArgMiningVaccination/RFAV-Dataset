San Francisco Department of Public HealthForeword Being overweight and obese has become a major health problem in California, including in our Chinese community. In California, more than a third of Chinese adults are overweight or obese.1 Among Chinese Americans, approximately 2% of normal weight adults have diabetes, whereas this number rises to more than 11% for adults who are obese. 2 Among Asian Americans, 58% of California children 3 and 77% of adults 1 are not eating enough fruit and vegetables. Eating at least 2 to 6\u00bd cups of fruits and vegetables (depending on your age, gender and activity level), and getting 30 to 60 minutes of physical activity every day, may help to lower our risk of becoming overweight and our risk of cancer, heart disease, Type 2 diabetes and obesity. 4 This bilingual booklet suggests ways to increase fruit and vegetable consumption and provides helpful tips on staying active. These easy methods to improve intake of fruits and vegetables are enhanced by celebrity chef Martin Yan and nutritionist Catherine Wong from Chinatown Public Health Center. They share their secrets for healthy eating and cooking using authentic Chinese recipes. I am pleased to recommend this well written and illustrated booklet that will help keep you healthy.

When planning meals, serve smaller portions, drink fewer sugary beverages, like soda, juice drinks and energy drinks, and use low sodium ingredients. If you don't drink milk you can try calcium fortified almond, soy or rice milk or lactose-free milk. In general, lactose-free milk provides more nutrition than the other options. This cookbook will help you prepare healthy and traditional home-cooked Chinese meals for you and your family. Look to the meal planning guide to see if your family is eating enough fruits and vegetables to promote good health. Refer to the physical activity suggestions to see how you and your family can include the daily physical activity that is so important in maintaining whole body wellness. We wish you and your family many years of good health.

Healthy eating and active lifestyles are the primary ways to prevent major causes of chronic disease and death in the United States. Research shows that eating at least 2\u00bd cups of vegetables and fruits per day is associated with a reduced risk of heart disease and stroke. Some vegetables and fruits may aid in protecting against certain types of cancer. 9 Strong evidence indicates that having regular moderate-intensity physical activity for at least 150 minutes per week lowers the risk of developing heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer. 10 This booklet informs you of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, health benefits of fruits and vegetables, the amount that you need to eat, and the healthier ways of cooking with fruits and vegetables. We have chosen the galloping horse for our project logo because it symbolizes health, strength and vitality for the Chinese. Enjoy eating a variety of colors and flavors of fruits and vegetables, be active and change your family's lifestyle to lower the risk of many chronic diseases. We wish you and your family an energetic and healthy life! Sincerely, Catherine Wong M.P .H., R.D.

California Department of Public Health, 2009.Make Supreme Stock to enhance flavor in cooking \"Supreme stock\" is used frequently in Chinese cooking; this kind of stock is often made in advance, and used for soup base. \"Supreme stock\" is usually made with meat or chicken and boiled for at least 3 hours until the flavor is intensified. You can make your own: (recipe makes 15 cups of stock) In a large stock pot, combine 2 pounds lean pork, 1 whole chicken, and enough water to cover at least 4 inches above the ingredients. Cook over high heat. When the water boils, reduce to medium-low heat and simmer for 3 hours. Add 1 teaspoon salt, remove from heat and let stand to cool. With a slotted spoon, remove the pork and chicken from the stock. Divide the stock into several smaller, shallow containers and refrigerate for at least 6 hours, or until fat becomes solid on surface of stock. Remove the fat from the stock. Use the stock as soup base, sauces and gravies, or to add flavor to vegetable dishes. Freeze the stock in ice cube trays or small containers and store in the freezer for future use. Frozen stock can be kept in freezer up to 2 months. Try the different recipes using the Supreme Stock on pages 32, 44, 46 and 48. To prevent food borne illness, the stock should be separated into smaller shallow containers and be refrigerated immediately.13 Tips for Physical Activity Moderate activities include: dancing, biking, tai-chi, gymnastics, stretching, light gardening, luk-tung kuen, walking (3.5 mph), yoga Vigorous activities include: aerobic dance, basketball, brisk walking (4.5 mph), jogging, jumping rope, heavy yard work, swimming Enjoy physical activity every day with family and friends For beginners, start with 10 to 15 minutes of physical activity a day, and gradually work up to 30 minutes a day or more Schedule a regular time each week for the family to enjoy physical activity together Include physical activity in family vacations Strengthen muscles and improve flexibility by lifting weights, stretching arms and legs, doing push-ups, sit-ups, leg-lifts, and arm-curls Do household chores that include physical activity, such as walking the dog, emptying the garbage, mopping or vacuuming the floors, washing the car, and mowing the lawn Limit the time on TV, video games, and computer to no more than 2 hours a day Bike or walk to work, walk with a co-worker during breaks or after lunch, use the stairs Start a walking group with neighbors, friends and/or relatives How much moderate to vigorous physical activity do we need every day?
