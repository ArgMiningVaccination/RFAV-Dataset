As complex beings with highly developed nervous systems, the path to healing can benefit from an integrative dynamic approach. By including [bottom up and top down mind-body-biofield approaches](https://www.complextrauma.org/complex-trauma/path-to-recovery/) to accessing the brain and nervous system, treatment can be more effective. Biofield & Energy Work Part of embodied experience goes beyond the limits of our physical body. Research continues to demonstrate that we have biomagnetic fields emitting from our hearts, brains and bodies that contribute to complex communication and regulation patterns. Working with the interplay between our environment and the way our nervous system impacts our chemistry can be invaluable to deepening healing work. Body-Based Practices Bodywork can do a whole lot more than just promote relaxation and tension reduction. Healing through the power of touch has been a part of many cultures for a number of generations. Take care of your spine, it is an extension of your brain! Mind-Body Integrative Practices Biofeedback practices that integrate techniques such as meditation & Yoga are great ways to increase self awareness and integration. Nutrition & Supplements Fuel Yourself To Thrive Psychological Wellness is deeply supported by how we nourish ourselves. Rooted Therapy supports integrative, sustainable nourishment that is generative for physical and emotional well-being and supportive of culturally diverse food norms. Psychopharmacology The appropriate role of medication and supplements in your personal care plan should be carefully discussed with a licensed practitioner specializing in your need area. Some mental health symptoms are best treated with psychiatric medications, while others can be managed effectively with therapy, supplements, plant medicine, and/or lifestyle changes. Self Care & Cultural Practices Most of us have been told to take better care of ourselves, but you may wonder what the payoff really is? When it comes to finding balance within ourselves, more and more research has been published supporting the importance of the mind-body connection and focusing on self care. An interdisciplinary approach naturally promotes inner balance and increased success. This may mean coordinating care with other practitioners to assure that all areas of wellness are being addressed. This allows for a personalized wellness plan that enhances the therapeutic journey with supplemental wellness activities outside of session. Integrative care positions At Rooted Therapy we are accustomed to collaborating with other healers. We are seeking to increase our integrative healing offerings. Trauma-informed practitioners are encouraged to connect with Jen regarding opportunities for integrative healing positions at the practice. "}
