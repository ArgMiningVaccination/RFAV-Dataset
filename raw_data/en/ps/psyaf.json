Here is a list of those arguments that have come up most frequently together with my (very short) comments: COVID is not dangerous It's just a flu and nothing to be really afraid of, they say. Therefore, no good reason exists for getting vaccinated. This, I think, is easily countered by pointing out that to date about 5.5 million people have died of COVID-19. In addition, I fear that the issues of 'long-COVID' is omitted in such discussions It's only the oldies who die As an oldie myself, I find this argument quite distasteful. More importantly, [it is simply not correct](https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2022-01-07/cdc-record-number-of-kids-with-coronavirus-are-hospitalized). Vaccines don't work True they do not protect us 100% from the infection. But they very dramatically reduce the likelihood of severe illness or death from COVID-19. Vaccines are unsafe We have now administered almost 10 billion vaccinations worldwide. Thus we know a lot about the risks. In absolute terms, there is a vast amount of cases, and it would be very odd otherwise; just think of the rate of nocebo effects that must be expected. However, the risks are mostly minor, and serious ones are very rare. Some anti-vaxxers predicted that, by last September, the vaccinated population would be dead. This did not happen, did it? The fact is that the benefits of these vaccinations hugely outweigh the risks. Vaccines are a vicious tracking system Some claim that 'they' use vaccines to be able to trace the vaccinated people. Who are 'they', and why would anyone want to trace me when my credit card, mobile phone, etc. already could do that? Vaccines are used for population control 'They' want to reduce the world population through deadly vaccines to ~5 billion, some anti-vaxxers say. Again, who are 'they' and would 'they' want to do that? Presumably 'they' need us to pay taxes and buy their goods and services. There has not been enough research If those who make this argument would bother to go on Medline and look for COVID-related research, they might see how ill-informed this argument is. Since 2021, more than 200 000 papers on the subject have emerged. I trust my immune system This is just daft. I am triple-vaccinated and also hope that I can trust my immune system - this is why I got vaccinated in the first place. Vaccinations rely on the immune system to work. It's all about making money Yes, the pharma industry aims to make money; this is a sad reality. But does that really mean that their products are useless? I don't see the logic here. People should have the choice I am all for it! But if someone's poor choice endangers my life, I do object. For instance, I expect other people not to smoke in public places, stop at red traffic lights and drive on the correct side of the street. Most COVID patients in hospitals have been vaccinated If a large percentage of the population has been vaccinated and the vaccine conveys not 100% protection, it would be most surprising, if it were otherwise. I have a friend who... All sorts of anecdotes are in circulation. The thing to remember here is that the plural of anecdote is anecdotes and not evidence. SCAM works just as well Of course, that argument had to be expected from SCAM proponents. The best response here is this: SHOW ME THE EVIDENCE! In response SCAM fans have so far only been able to produce 'studies' that are unconvincing or outright laughable. In conclusion, the arguments put forward by anti-vaxxers or vaccination-hesitant people are rubbish. It is time they inform themselves better and consider information that originates from outside their bubble. It is time they realize that their attitude is endangering others. "}
