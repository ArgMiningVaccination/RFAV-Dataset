She was patient and took the time to explain things to me so I understood every aspect of the process, testing, diagnosis, and treatment plan. I was so relieved to receive this level of care after nearly 2 years with a traditional medical provider pushing prescription medications with little to no regard for the risks and side effects. I highly recommend trusting Dr June Stevens will your health and well being. She is worth every dollar! - 1/15/2023 I am blessed to of found such a wonderful, caring and empathetic Doctor like Dr. June. For years I have been struggling with some health issues, I have been with Kaiser for over 25 years. All they have done is prescribe harmful medications and consistently let me know my symptoms weren't something they had ever heard from any other patient. It wasn't until I met with Dr. June that I now know where the root cause of my symptoms lie. With an Oligascan and OAT test, I know what i need to do to get my health back on track and I'm so grateful to of found her. If you want to be seen by a Dr whom truly listens, and makes you feel seen and heard, look no further. Dr. June is a godsend. - 5/3/2023 Dr. June Stevens is amazing! She is very knowledgeable and understands how the body works, each part and in unison. She welcomes questions and answers them thoroughly with the intention to teach and not merely answer. She is thorough and warm. Definitely the right person when you are seeking a natural medicine route! - 2/20/2023 Dr. June Stevens took the time to ask me several questions about my lifestyle, health, as well as took an extensive blood panel and was able to give me feedback about how to bounce back from my health issues . I did not know that I was extremely deficient in vitamin B, as well as some other issues that she was able to uncover. She gave me practical advice on what to eat differently, as well as how to rearrange a stressful schedule in order to have my body reflect more peace. I highly recommend this doctor and her institution, and I would visit her for any further future needs. - 5/18/2022 My fianc\u00e9 and I love Dr Steven's! We came to her for natural health solutions & overall health. She has a lot of patient but she is very generous with her time and is an incredible listener. She makes all of the health terms understandable and explains the process of the relevant bodily functions which is really cool. Thanks Dr Steven's! - 6/28/2021 Dr. Stevens is great. She is very knowledgeable and kind. I really enjoy being her patient. I always learn from her at my appointments. I highly recommend her. - 6/22/2021 I had medical issues that baffled medical doctors who just wanted to give me tons of medications without even trying g to find out what was wrong with me. Dr. June took the time to treat the cause, not medicate the symptoms. I didn't have any relief from my problems until I followed Dr. June's direction. She knows what she's doing and cares about finding the cause of the issue. I highly recommend her. - 6/8/2021 I have had a great experience at Nor Cal and the staff is very friendly and professional. Dr June is compassionate and very knowledgeable. I have learned to use diet and supplements to improve my health as well as other lifestyle practices. I was also able to get specific tests to determine how my body was functioning. I highly recommend Nor Cal Natural Medicine and appreciate having them in our area. - 6/30/2021 I was on 13 medications before I saw Dr. June Stevens. My body was tired and I had mental and emotional problems from the side effects of the western medicine. She was patient, kind, and understanding. I enjoyed working with her. I was on warfarin before and my INR level was unstable. After taking the natural medicine she gave me for 8 months, everything stabilized. I only had to use one type of natural supplement. My mental health is totally normal. I recommend Dr. Stevens! - 6/14/2021 Dr. June's knowledge and expertise are extraordinary. She has my complete trust for my health, the most important aspect of my life.
