He was an FDA medical officer before being appointed by former president Donald Trump's White House as senior adviser to the FDA commissioner for drug safety, FDA science policy and FDA regulatory affairs. Late in March, Gortler wrote a column where he warned that [the FDA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Pfizer and Moderna](https://thefederalist.com/2022/03/25/why-arent-the-fda-and-cdc-informing-the-public-about-documented-adverse-events-after-mrna-injections/) have all known from the beginning about myocarditis and pericarditis risks from the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, many adverse events have been reported using the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), the tracking system run by the FDA and the CDC. But Gortler pointed out that Americans have received no formal warnings, such as labeling and letters to warn physicians, pharmacists or the public. He thinks that it is because it would dispel the narrative that getting vaccines and boosters is the \"patriotic duty\" of Americans. Usually, notifying consumers and prescribers of updates in safety and efficacy is the responsibility of manufacturers. Gortler also noted that the meager 107-page FDA review document obviously excluded \"clinically important serious adverse like and pericarditis. [Myocarditis](https://www.naturalpedia.com/myocarditis-causes-side-effects-and-treatments-at-naturalpedia-com.html) and pericarditis involve inflammation of the heart and the sac containing the heart, respectively.

Meanwhile, Moderna's review only had 30 pages but presented reports of myocarditis and pericarditis in the initial study. There's no denying that there are many safety and efficacy issues with coronavirus vaccines and boosters, warned Gortler. Since the FDA's 18,000-plus employees had access to the same drug safety data, this emphasizes the fact that [ there is still no updated COVID-19 labeling](http://fda.news) reflecting the latest safety and efficacy findings in VAERS. Gortler has these questions for the FDA: Gortler also advised that for any physician, pharmacist or other health professional working for the FDA, CDC or another agency, the failure to warn patients about the potential dangers of any drug would place their professional licenses at risk. He added that more evidence of \"clear malfeasance\" will be revealed, but probably under a Republican administration. If that happens, all the licensed practitioners and scientists who withheld crucial information about the [side effects of the COVID-19 vaccines](https://vaccines.news/) from the public should be thoroughly investigated by their academic boards and licensing authorities. Despite the many reported cases of adverse reactions, FDA officials are still pushing the \"potentially risky vaccine\" by hiding data from the public. Even the FDA website shows images of children and young adults getting boosters. However, the latest CDC data has revealed that there is no known benefit of coronavirus vaccination for those low-risk groups.
