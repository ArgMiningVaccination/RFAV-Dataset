Last week, you should have received an email regarding your housing assignment, which is also available on your Housing Portal at myhousing.depaul.edu . In addition to your Fall Quarter 2021 housing assignment, we included a reminder about securing your COVID-19 vaccination before moving to campus and contacting the Office of the University Registrar to provide your personal vaccination record. This reminder also stated the importance of being vaccinated in order to live on campus. Should you require an exemption from the vaccine, please visit the Immunization Exemptions webpage to review information related to exemptions and submit the required forms. If an exemption is granted, the Department of Housing, Dining & Student Centers, and the Department of Residential Education will reach out to you quickly and directly for further discussion and to address options or potential accommodations for you. Residence halls are unlike other campus offices and buildings in that students live in close proximity to each other. Therefore, we must provide an additional review of any exempted students planning to live on campus. Please have a safe summer. We look forward to seeing you in a few short months! Take care, Rick Moreci, Director Department of Housing, Dining & Student Centers DePaul UniversityRod Waters, Director Department of Residential Education DePaul University "}
