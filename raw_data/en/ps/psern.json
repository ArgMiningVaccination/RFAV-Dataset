This article seeks to provide valuable and equitable information in the form of a clinician's guide for removing the barriers to early detection and diagnosis of cognitive impairments and offers an unprecedented opportunity to improve the clinical outcomes and care of older adults with various levels of cognitive decline, including mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, and related dementias.
