The lack of access to energy hinders economic and human development. Latest data suggest that the world continues to advance towards sustainable energy targets. Nevertheless, the current pace of progress is insufficient to achieve Goal 7 by 2030. Huge disparities in access to modern sustainable energy persist. Rising commodity, energy and shipping prices have increased the cost of producing and transporting solar photovoltaics modules, wind turbines and biofuels worldwide, adding uncertainty to a development trajectory that is already far below Goal 7 ambitions. Achieving energy and climate goals will require continued policy support and a massive mobilization of public and private capital for clean and renewable energy, especially in developing countries. - The world continues to advance towards sustainable energy targets - but not fast enough. At the current pace, about 660 million people will still lack access to electricity and close to 2 billion people will still rely on polluting fuels and technologies for cooking by 2030. - Renewable sources power nearly 30 per cent of energy consumption in the electricity sector, but challenges remain in heating and transport sectors. Developing countries experience 9.6 per cent annual growth in renewable energy installation, but despite enormous needs, international financial flows for clean energy continue to decline. - To ensure access to energy for all by 2030, we must accelerate electrification, increase investments in renewable energy, improve energy efficiency and develop enabling policies and regulatory frameworks. - 733 million people don't have access to electricity. That's about one in ten people worldwide. [Energy Access | United Nations Development Programme](https://www.undp.org/energy/our-work-areas/energy-access) - Access to electricity went from [73% in 1998 to 90% in 2020](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.ELC.ACCS.ZS). [Access to electricity | United Nations Development Programme](https://www.undp.org/energy/our-work-areas/energy-access/access-electricity) - It's estimated that between US$ 35 billion and 40 billion are needed annually to reach universal electricity access between 2021 and 2030 to reach universal access to electricity. [Access to electricity | United Nations Development Programme](https://www.undp.org/energy/our-work-areas/energy-access/access-electricity) 7.1 By 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services 7.2 By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix 7.3 By 2030, double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency 7.A By 2030, enhance international cooperation to facilitate access to clean energy research and technology, including renewable energy, energy efficiency and advanced and cleaner fossil-fuel technology, and promote investment in energy infrastructure and clean energy technology 7.B By 2030, expand infrastructure and upgrade technology for supplying modern and sustainable energy services for all in developing countries, in particular least developed countries, small island developing States, and land-locked developing countries, in accordance with their respective programmes of support Related news [Early warning initiative and net-zero group report, among COP27 outcomes](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2022/11/early-warning-initiative-and-net-zero-group-report-among-cop27-outcomes/) All eyes are on the UN Climate Change Conference (COP27), as heads of State and Government, activists, businesses, academia, cities and other stakeholders gathered in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt.
