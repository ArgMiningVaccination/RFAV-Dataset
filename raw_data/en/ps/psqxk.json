The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend vaccination for all people aged 5 years and older, including people who are pregnant, breastfeeding, trying to get pregnant now, or might become pregnant in the future . Vaccination is the best way to reduce the risks of COVID -19 infection and COVID -related complications for both you and your baby. Three vaccine s are available to prevent COVID -19: The two-dose Pfizer vaccine for people 12 years and older and a lower -dose vaccine for people 5 to 11 years old The two-dose Moderna vaccine for people 18 years and older The one -dose J ohnson & Johnson vaccine for people 18 years and older (you may also see this vaccine referred to as the \"Janssen vaccine\") For t hose receiving the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine s, the second dose is given 21 days (Pfizer) and 2 8 days (Moderna) after the first dose.1 The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is only one dose.2 The CDC recommend s a preference for people to get an mRNA vaccine (Pfizer or Moderna) over the J ohnson & Johnson vaccine. The reasons for this recommendation are: The superior effectiveness of mRNA vaccines against recent COVID -19 variants Johnson & Johnson vaccine 's association w ith a very rare, yet serious, side effect (blood clots) The current large supply of mRNA vaccines in the United States Anyone who isn't willing or able to get an mRNA vaccine can still get the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.3 Information for Pregnant Individuals If you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant and are thinking about getting vaccinated , consider talking with your health care professional about the vaccine . To help with your decision, y ou should consider the following key points : What are benefits of getting the COVID -19 vaccine s during pregnancy? The vaccines can help protect you from getting COVID -19. With the two -dose vaccines, you should get both doses for maximum effectiveness. It's not yet known how long protection lasts . Another pot ential benefit is that getting the vaccine while pregnant may help you pass anti - COVID -19 antibodies to your baby. In numerous studies of vaccinated moms, antibodies were found in the umbilical cord blood of babies and in the mother's breastmilk .4-13 The CDC, along with other federal partners, are monitoring p eople who have been vaccinated for serious side effects .14 So far, more than 139,000 pregnant people have been vaccinated . No unexpected pregnancy or fetal problems have occurred . There have been no reports of any increased risk of pregnancy loss, fetal growth problems, or birth defects.15 A safe vaccine is generally considered one in which the benefits of being vaccinated outweigh the risks . The current vaccine s are not live vaccine s. The vaccines do not cross the placenta because they are quickly broken down by the muscle where they're given. The antibodies that your body makes in response to the vaccine do cross the placenta and protect your baby from COVID -19 after birth . There is no evidence that v accines affect future fertility. The only people who should NOT get vaccinated are those who have had a severe allergic reaction to vaccines in the past or any vaccine ingredients . Side effects may occur in the first 3 days after getting vaccinated .1 These include mild to moderate fever, headache, and muscle aches . Side effects may be worse after the second dose of the P fizer and Moderna vaccines .16, 17 Fever should be avoided during pregna ncy, especially in the first trimester. Those who dev elop a fever after vaccination can take acet aminophen (Tylenol). This medication is safe to use during pregnancy and does not affect how the vaccine works. What are the known risks of getting COVID -19 during pregnancy? About 1 to 3 per 1,000 pregnant women with COVID -19 will develop severe disease.18, 19 Compared with those who aren't pregnant , pregnant people infected by the COVID -19 virus : Are 3 times more likely to need ICU care Anyone can get the COVID vaccines free of charge regardless of immigration status or whether they have insurance. You may be asked for your social security number, but it is NOT required to get vaccinated. Are 2 to 3 times more likely to need advanced life support and a breathing tube Have a small increased risk of dying due to COVID -19 They may also be at increased risk of stillbirth and preterm bi rth.19-21 What is my risk of getting COVID -19? Your risk of getting COVID -19 depends on the likelihood of com ing into contact with another infected person. The risk may be higher if you live in a community where there is a lot of COVID -19 infection or work in healthcare or another high -contact setting. What is my risk for severe complications if I get COVID -19? Data show that o lder p regnant women ; those with preexisting health conditions , such as obesity , diabetes, and heart disorders ; and Black or Latinx people have an especially increased risk of severe disease and death from COVID -19.19-21 If you still have questions about the vaccine s or need more information, ask you r health care provider or go to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's COVID -19 vaccine webpage . Information for Breastfeeding/Lactating Individuals The Society for Maternal -Fetal Medicine and other pregnancy experts recommend COVID -19 vaccin ation for people who are breastfeeding /lactating . You don't have to delay or stop breastfeeding just because you get vaccinated . Booster Shots Are Recommended for Pregnant People Although being fully vaccinated provides great protection against hospitalization and serious illness from COVID -19 infection, vaccine effectiveness may decrease over time. This happens with other vaccines as well, like tdap. A n extra shot can boost the immune response and give improved protection ag ainst COVID -19. SMFM and other expert org anizations recommend a booster shot for all pregnant people . A booster shot is recommended f or all pregnant people who received the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines 6 months after completing the initial 2 -shot vaccination series . For pregnant people aged 18 and older who received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, a booster is recommended 2 or more months after getting the initial shot . You can choose which vaccine you get as a booster and \"mix and match\" your initial vaccine and booster. So whether you received the Pfizer, Moderna, or Johnson & Johnson vaccine initially, you can get a booster with any of these vaccine s. Boosters (and the initial vaccines) may be given at any time dur ing pregnancy and can be given with other vaccines (like the flu shot). Getting Vaccinat ed You can get vaccinated at any time during pregnancy. The CDC is committed to monitoring the vaccine's safety for all individuals. Your health professional or vaccine clinic may give you information about enrolling in the v-safe after vaccination health checker (see the box below) . Even a fter you're fully vaccinated, i t is important to follow the CDC's guidance for wearing a mask indoors in areas where there are substantial or high rates of COVID -19 infection . You can check the infection rate in your area here . References 1. Oliver SE, Gargano JW, Marin M, Wallace M, Curran KG, Chamberland M, et al.

At sign -up, you can indicate that you are pregnant. Once you do that, expect the following: Someone may call you from the v -safe program to ask initial questions and get more information. You may be asked to enroll in the vaccine pregnancy registry , which is collect ing information about any effects of the vaccine during pregnancy . This is a great way to help scientists monitor the vaccine's safety and effectiveness. 7. Zdanowski W, Waniewski T.
