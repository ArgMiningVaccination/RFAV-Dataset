The non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) are a heterogeneous group of lymphoproliferative malignancies with differing patterns of behavior and responses to treatment.[ Like Hodgkin lymphoma, NHL usually originates in lymphoid tissues and can spread to other organs. NHL, however, is much less predictable than Hodgkin lymphoma and has a far greater predilection to disseminate to extranodal sites. The prognosis depends on the histological type, stage, and treatment. Incidence and Mortality Estimated new cases and deaths from NHL in the United States in 2023:[ Anatomy NHL usually originates in lymphoid tissues. Anatomy of the lymph system. Prognosis and Survival NHL can be divided into two prognostic groups: the indolent lymphomas and the aggressive lymphomas. Indolent NHL types have a relatively good prognosis with a median survival as long as 20 years, but they usually are not curable in advanced clinical stages.[ The aggressive type of NHL has a shorter natural history, but a significant number of these patients can be cured with intensive combination chemotherapy regimens. In general, with modern treatment of patients with NHL, the overall survival rate at 5 years is over 60%. More than 50% of patients with aggressive NHL can be cured. Most relapses occur in the first 2 years after therapy. The risk of late relapse is higher in patients who manifest both indolent and aggressive histologies.[ While indolent NHL is responsive to immunotherapy, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, a continuous rate of relapse is usually seen in advanced stages. Patients, however, can often be re-treated with considerable success if the disease histology remains low grade. Patients who present with or convert to aggressive forms of NHL may have sustained complete remissions with combination chemotherapy regimens or aggressive consolidation with marrow or stem cell support.[ References: Late effects of treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) have been observed. Impaired fertility may occur after exposure to alkylating agents.[ Left ventricular dysfunction was a significant late effect in long-term survivors of high-grade NHL who received more than 200 mg/m\u00b2 of doxorubicin.[ Myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myelogenous leukemia are late complications of myeloablative therapy with autologous bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell support, as well as conventional chemotherapy-containing alkylating agents.[ Successful pregnancies with children born free of congenital abnormalities have been reported in young women after autologous BMT.[ Long-term impaired immune health was evaluated in a retrospective cohort study of 21,690 survivors of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma from the California Cancer Registry. Elevated incidence rate ratios were found up to 10 years later for pneumonia (10.8-fold), meningitis (5.3-fold), immunoglobulin deficiency (17.6-fold), and autoimmune cytopenias (12-fold).[ Some patients have osteopenia or osteoporosis at the start of therapy; bone density may worsen after therapy for lymphoma.[ References: A pathologist should be considered for consultation before a biopsy because some studies require special preparation of tissue (e.g., frozen tissue). Knowledge of cell surface markers and immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor gene rearrangements may help with diagnostic and therapeutic decisions. The clonal excess of light-chain immunoglobulin may differentiate malignant from reactive cells. Since the prognosis and the approach to treatment are influenced by histopathology, outside biopsy specimens should be carefully reviewed by a hematopathologist who is experienced in diagnosing lymphomas. Although lymph node biopsies are recommended whenever possible, sometimes immunophenotypic data are sufficient to allow diagnosis of lymphoma when fine-needle aspiration cytology is preferred.[ Historical Classification Systems Historically, uniform treatment of patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) has been hampered by the lack of a uniform classification system. In 1982, results of a consensus study were published as the Working mixed, lymphocytic, non-Burkitt| Current Classification Systems As the understanding of NHL has improved and as the histopathological diagnosis of NHL has become more sophisticated with the use of immunologic and genetic techniques, a number of new pathological entities have been described.[ The WHO modification of the REAL classification recognizes three major categories of lymphoid malignancies based on and lymphoid leukemias are included in this classification because both solid and circulating phases are present in many lymphoid neoplasms and distinction between them is artificial. For example, B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and B-cell small lymphocytic lymphoma are simply different manifestations of the same neoplasm, as are lymphoblastic lymphomas and acute lymphocytic leukemias. Within the B-cell and T-cell categories, two subdivisions are recognized: precursor neoplasms, which correspond to the earliest stages of differentiation, and more mature differentiated neoplasms.[ Updated encompasses all the lymphoproliferative neoplasms. For more information, see the following PDQ summaries: PDQ modification of REAL classification of lymphoproliferative diseases Follicular lymphoma comprises 20% of all NHL and as many as 70% of the indolent lymphomas reported in American and European clinical trials.[ Prognosis Despite the advanced stage, the median survival ranges from 8 to 15 years, leading to the designation of being indolent.[ Patients with one risk factor or none have an 85% 10-year survival rate, and three or more risk factors confer a 40% 10-year survival rate.[ Three retrospective analyses, including one pooled analysis of 5,225 patients in 13 randomized clinical trials, identified a high-risk group that had a 50% OS rate at 5 years when relapses occurred within 24 months of induction chemoimmunotherapy.[ Follicular, small-cleaved lymphoma and follicular cell lymphoma do not have reproducibly different disease-free survival or OS. Therapeutic approaches Because of the often-indolent clinical course and the lack of symptoms in some patients with follicular lymphoma, watchful waiting remains a standard of care during the initial encounter and for patients with slow asymptomatic relapsing disease. When therapy is required, numerous therapeutic options may be employed in varying sequences with an OS equivalence at 5 to 10 years.[ Follicular lymphoma in situ and primary follicular lymphoma of the duodenum are particularly indolent variants that rarely progress and rarely require therapy.[ Patients with indolent lymphoma may experience a relapse with a more aggressive histology. If the clinical pattern of relapse suggests that the disease is behaving in a more aggressive manner, a biopsy can be performed, if feasible.[ In a prospective nonrandomized study, at a median follow-up of 6.8 years, 379 (14%) of 2,652 patients subsequently transformed to a more aggressive histology after an initial immunoglobulin M (IgM) type (Waldenstr\u00f6m macroglobulinemia).[ Asymptomatic patients can be monitored for evidence of disease progression without immediate need for chemotherapy.[ Prognostic factors associated with symptoms requiring therapy include the following: Therapeutic approaches The management of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma is similar to that of other alkylating agents, either as single agents or as part of combination chemotherapy.[ Previously untreated patients who received rituximab had response rates of 60% to 80%, but close monitoring of the serum IgM is required because of a sudden rise in this paraprotein at the start of therapy.[ Myeloablative therapy with autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell support is under clinical evaluation.[ Marginal Zone Lymphoma Marginal zone lymphomas were previously included among the diffuse, small lymphocytic lymphomas. When marginal zone lymphomas involve the nodes, they are called monocytoid B-cell lymphomas or nodal marginal zone B-cell lymphomas, and when they involve extranodal sites (e.g., gastrointestinal tract, thyroid, lung, breast, orbit, and skin), they are called mucosa-associated lymphatic tissue (MALT) lymphomas.[ Gastric MALT Many patients have a history of autoimmune disease, such as Hashimoto thyroiditis or Sj\u00f6gren syndrome, or of Helicobacter gastritis. Most patients present with stage I or stage II extranodal disease, which is most often in the stomach. Treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection may resolve most cases of localized gastric involvement.[ Extragastric MALT Localized involvement of other sites can be treated with radiation or surgery.[ Nodal marginal zone lymphoma Patients with nodal marginal zone lymphoma (monocytoid B-cell lymphoma) are treated with the same paradigm of watchful waiting or therapies as described for follicular lymphoma.[ Mediterranean abdominal lymphoma The disease variously known as Mediterranean abdominal lymphoma, heavy-chain disease, or immunoproliferative small intestinal disease (IPSID), which occurs in young adults in eastern Mediterranean countries, is another version of MALT lymphoma, which responds to antibiotics in its early stages.[ Splenic marginal zone lymphoma Splenic marginal zone lymphoma is an indolent lymphoma that is marked by massive splenomegaly and peripheral blood and bone marrow involvement, usually without adenopathy.[ Management is similar to that of other low-grade lymphomas and usually involves rituximab alone or anaplastic large cell lymphoma presents in the skin only with no preexisting lymphoproliferative disease and no extracutaneous sites of involvement.[ Patients with localized disease usually undergo radiation therapy. With more disseminated involvement, watchful waiting or doxorubicin-based combination chemotherapy is applied.[ For more information, see Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Treatment, Mycosis Fungoides (Including S\u00e9zary Syndrome) Treatment, Hairy Cell Leukemia Treatment, and Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment. References: Aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) includes the B-cell Lymphoma Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of NHL and comprises 30% of newly diagnosed cases.[ Some cases of large B-cell lymphoma have a prominent background of reactive T cells and often of histiocytes, so-called T-cell/histiocyte-rich large B-cell lymphoma. This subtype of large cell lymphoma has frequent liver, spleen, and bone marrow involvement; however, the outcome is equivalent to that of similarly staged patients with DLBCL.[ Prognosis Most patients with localized disease are curable with combined-modality therapy or combination chemotherapy alone.[ The National Comprehensive Cancer Network International Prognostic Index (IPI) for aggressive NHL (diffuse large cell lymphoma) identifies the following five significant risk factors prognostic of OS and their associated risk scores:[ Risk scores: Age-adjusted and stage-adjusted modifications of this IPI are used for younger patients with localized disease.[ The BCL2 gene and rearrangement of the MYC gene or dual overexpression of the MYC gene, or both, confer a particularly poor prognosis.[ In a retrospective review of 117 patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL who underwent autologous SCT, the 4-year and MYC), 61% double-expressor (no rearrangement, but increased expression of BCL2 and MYC), and 70% for patients without these features.[ Molecular profiles of gene expression using DNA microarrays may help to stratify patients in the future for therapies directed at specific targets and to better predict survival after standard chemotherapy.[ Central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis The CNS-IPI tool predicts which patients have a CNS relapse risk exceeding 10%. It was developed by the German Lymphoma Study Group and validated by the British Columbia Cancer Agency database. The presence of four to six of the CNS-IPI risk factors (age >60 years, performance status 2, elevated LDH, stage III or IV disease, >1 extranodal site, or involvement of the kidneys or adrenal glands) was used to define a high-risk group for CNS recurrence (a 12% risk of CNS involvement by 2 years).[ CNS prophylaxis (usually with four to six doses of intrathecal methotrexate) is often recommended for patients with testicular analyses.[ subset of DLBCL with molecular characteristics that are most similar to nodular-sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). Mediastinal lymphomas HL are called mediastinal gray-zone lymphomas.[ Prognosis and therapy are the same as for other comparably staged patients with DLBCL. Uncontrolled, phase II studies employing high cure rates while avoiding any mediastinal radiation.[ A retrospective review of 109 patients with PMBCL showed that 63% had a negative end-of-treatment PET-CT (EOT-PET-CT) (Deauville score 1-3).[ In situations where mediastinal radiation therapy would encompass the left side of the heart or would increase breast cancer risk in young female patients, proton therapy may be considered to reduce radiation dose to organs at risk.[ Because PMBCL is characterized by high expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and variable expression of CD30, a phase II study evaluated nivolumab plus brentuximab vedotin in 30 patients with relapsed disease. With a median follow-up of 11.1 months, the objective response rate was 73% (95% CI, 54%88%).[ Follicular Large Cell Lymphoma Prognosis The natural history of follicular large cell lymphoma remains controversial.[ Therapeutic approaches Treatment of follicular large cell lymphoma is more similar to treatment of aggressive NHL than it is to the treatment of indolent NHL. In support of this approach, treatment with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic peripheral SCT shows the same curative potential in patients with follicular large cell lymphoma who relapse as it does in patients with diffuse large cell lymphoma who relapse.[ Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma Anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCL) may be confused with carcinomas and are associated with the Ki-1 (CD30) antigen. These lymphomas are usually of T-cell origin, often present with extranodal disease, and are found especially in the skin.[ The translocation of chromosomes 2 and 5 creates a unique fusion protein with a nucleophosmin-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK).[ Patients whose lymphomas express ALK (immunohistochemistry) are usually younger and may have systemic symptoms, extranodal disease, and advanced-stage disease; however, they have a more favorable survival rate than that of ALK-negative patients.[ In a prospective randomized trial of 452 patients T-cell 48% ALK-negative patients), the previously used standard regimen, CHOP, was compared with brentuximab vedotin (an anti-CD30 monoclonal doxorubicin, and prednisone.[ ALCL in children is usually characterized by systemic and cutaneous disease and has high response rates and good OS with doxorubicin-based combination chemotherapy.[ Extranodal (nasal type) is an aggressive lymphoma marked by extensive necrosis and angioinvasion, most often presenting in extranodal sites, in particular the nasal or paranasal sinus region.[ The increased risk of CNS involvement and of local recurrence has led to recommendations for radiation therapy locally, concurrently, before the start of chemotherapy or between cycle two and three of chemotherapy, and for intrathecal prophylaxis and/or prophylactic cranial radiation therapy.[ A retrospective review of 1,273 early-stage patients stratified them into a low-risk group and high-risk group using stage, age, LDH, performance status, and primary tumor invasion. Low-risk patients fared best with radiation therapy alone,[ In a retrospective review of 303 previously untreated patients from an international consortium who received nonanthracycline chemotherapy, the OS rates were identical for early-stage patients (72%74% at 5 years) who received either concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy or chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy.[ Higher doses of radiation therapy administered at more than 50 Gy are associated with improved outcomes according to anecdotal reports.[ Granulomatosis Lymphomatoid granulomatosis a predominant T-cell background.[ Patients are managed like others with diffuse large cell lymphoma and require dysproteinemia. Characterized by clonal T-cell receptor gene rearrangement, this entity is managed like diffuse large cell lymphoma.[ Doxorubicin-based combination chemotherapy, such as the CHOP regimen, is recommended as it is for other aggressive lymphomas.[ Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma Patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma have diffuse large cell or diffuse mixed lymphoma that expresses a cell surface phenotype of a postthymic (or peripheral) T-cell expressing CD4 or CD8 but not both together.[ Prognosis Most investigators report worse response and survival rates for patients with peripheral T-cell lymphomas than for patients with comparably staged B-cell aggressive lymphomas.[ Therapeutic approaches Therapy involves doxorubicin-based combination chemotherapy (such as CHOP or CHOPE [CHOP plus etoposide]), which is also used for DLBCL.[ A randomized prospective trial included 104 patients younger than 61 years with stage II, III, or IV peripheral T-cell lymphoma (excluding ALK-positive ALCL). Patients received either cisplatin).[ In a prospective trial of 109 evaluable patients with relapsing disease, treatment with pralatrexate resulted in a 30% response rate and a median 10-month duration of response.[ An unusual type of peripheral T-cell lymphoma occurring mostly in young men, hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma, appears to be localized to the hepatic and splenic sinusoids, with cell surface expression Intestinal T-cell Lymphoma Enteropathy-type intestinal with gluten-sensitive enteropathy (celiac sprue).[ Therapy is with doxorubicin-based combination chemotherapy, but relapse rates appear higher than for comparably staged diffuse large lymphoma.[ Intravascular Large B-cell Lymphoma lymphoma confined to the intravascular lumen. The brain, kidneys, lungs, and skin are the organs most likely affected by intravascular lymphomatosis. With the use of aggressive R-CHOP-based combination chemotherapy, as is used in DLBCL, the prognosis is similar to that of conventional stage IV DLBCL.[ typically involves younger patients and represents the most common type of pediatric NHL.[ In some patients with larger B cells, there is morphological overlap with DLBCL. These Burkitt-like large cell lymphomas show MYC deregulation, extremely high proliferation rates, and a gene-expression profile as expected for classic Burkitt lymphoma.[ Therapeutic approaches Treatment of Burkitt lymphoma/diffuse small involves aggressive multidrug regimens in combination with rituximab, similar to those used for the advanced-stage aggressive large cell).[ Lymphoblastic Lymphoma Lymphoblastic lymphoma (precursor T-cell) is a very aggressive form of NHL. It often, but not exclusively, occurs in young patients.[ Treatment is usually patterned after that for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Intensive combination chemotherapy with or without bone marrow transplantation is the standard treatment for this aggressive histological type of NHL.[ Adult T-cell Leukemia/Lymphoma Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma is caused by infection with the retrovirus human T-lymphotrophic virus 1 and is frequently associated with lymphadenopathy, hypercalcemia, circulating leukemic cells, bone and skin involvement, hepatosplenomegaly, a rapidly progressive course, and poor response to combination chemotherapy.[ The acute and lymphoma types of ATL have done poorly with strategies of combination chemotherapy and allogeneic SCT with a median OS under 1 year.[ The combination of zidovudine and interferon-alpha has activity against ATL, even for patients who failed previous cytotoxic therapy. Durable remissions are seen in most patients who present with this combination, but are not seen in patients with the lymphoma subtype of ATL.[ Mantle Cell Lymphoma Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is found in lymph nodes, the spleen, bone marrow, blood, and sometimes the gastrointestinal system (lymphomatous polyposis).[ Like the low-grade lymphomas, MCL appears incurable with anthracycline-based chemotherapy and occurs in older patients with generally asymptomatic advanced-stage disease. The median survival, however, is significantly shorter (5-7 years) than that of other lymphomas, and this histology is now considered to be an aggressive lymphoma.[ Therapeutic approaches Asymptomatic patients with low-risk scores on the IPI may do well when initial therapy is deferred.[ It is unclear which therapeutic approach offers the best long-term survival in this clinicopathological entity. In a phase II trial of previously untreated patients with MCL older than 64 years, 50 patients received the B-cell receptor-inhibitor ibrutinib plus rituximab. With a median follow-up of 45 months, the overall response rate was 96%, the CR rate was 76%, the 3-year PFS rate was 87%, and the 3-year OS rate was 94%.[ A prospective randomized trial included 523 patients aged 65 years and older with MCL. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either ibrutinib, bendamustine, and rituximab or bendamustine and rituximab alone.[ In a prospective randomized trial, 560 patients older than 60 years and not eligible for SCT were given either R-CHOP or R-FC (rituximab, fludarabine, cyclophosphamide) for six to eight cycles, followed by maintenance therapy in responders randomly assigned to rituximab or interferon-alpha maintenance therapy.[ A prospective randomized trial of 497 patients younger than 65 years compared six cycles of R-CHOP with six cycles of alternating R-CHOP and R-DHAP (rituximab, dexamethasone, cytarabine, then receiving autologous SCT.[ Randomized trials have not confirmed an OS benefit in patients who receive consolidation therapy with autologous or allogeneic SCT.[ In a prospective trial (NCT00921414) of 299 patients who were previously untreated for MCL, 257 responders received four courses of R-DHAP and autologous SCT. The patients were randomly assigned to receive rituximab maintenance therapy for 3 years versus no maintenance therapy. After randomization, a median follow-up at 50.2 months showed the rate of PFS at 4-years favored the rituximab-maintenance arm at 83% the no-maintenance arm at 64% (95% CI, 55%-73%; P < .001). The 4-year OS rate also favored the rituximab-maintenance arm at 89% (95% CI, 81%-94%) versus the 72%-88%; P = .04).[ Lenalidomide with or without rituximab also shows response rates of around 50% in relapsed patients, with even higher response rates for previously untreated patients.[ Acalabrutinib (another B-cell receptor inhibitor via the Bruton tyrosine kinase [BTK] pathway) was studied in 124 patients with relapsed or refractory MCL.[ Patients with relapsed or refractory MCL whose disease did not respond to ibrutinib or acalabrutinib were enrolled in a phase II trial using brexucabtagene autoleucel, an anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy.[ In summary, the optimal sequencing of these various therapies is unclear and is the subject of an ongoing Intergroup clinical trial. Rituximab, lenalidomide, ibrutinib, acalabrutinib, venetoclax, and zanubrutinib represent directed biological agents that may lead to chemotherapy-free treatment strategies for patients with MCL.[ Routine administration of CNS prophylaxis in high-risk MCL has never been studied in a prospective randomized trial. The use of intrathecal or high-dose methotrexate or the use of systemic therapies with CNS penetration like ibrutinib, high-dose cytarabine, or venetoclax, have not been studied and proven efficacious in this situation.[ Posttransplantation Lymphoproliferative Disorder Patients who undergo transplantation of the heart, lung, liver, kidney, or pancreas usually require lifelong immunosuppression. This may result in posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) in 1% to 3% of recipients, which appears as an aggressive lymphoma.[ Prognosis Poor performance status, grafted organ involvement, high IPI, elevated LDH, and multiple sites of disease are poor prognostic factors for PTLD.[ Therapeutic options In some cases, withdrawal of immunosuppression results in eradication of the lymphoma.[ True Histiocytic Lymphoma True histiocytic lymphomas are very rare tumors that show histiocytic differentiation and express histiocytic markers in the absence of B-cell or T-cell lineage-specific immunologic markers.[ Therapeutic options Therapy is modeled after the treatment of comparably staged diffuse large cell lymphomas, but the optimal approach remains to be defined. Primary Effusion Lymphoma Primary effusion lymphoma presents exclusively or mainly in the pleural, pericardial, or abdominal cavities in the absence of an identifiable tumor mass.[ Prognosis The prognosis of primary effusion lymphoma is extremely poor. Therapeutic approaches Therapy is usually modeled after the treatment of comparably staged diffuse large cell lymphomas. Plasmablastic Lymphoma Plasmablastic lymphoma is most often seen in patients with HIV infection and is characterized by CD20-negative large B cells with plasmacytic features. This type of lymphoma has a very aggressive clinical course, including poor responses and short remissions with standard chemotherapy.[ References: Stage is important in selecting a treatment for patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Chest and abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans are usually part of the staging evaluation for all lymphoma patients. The staging system is similar to the staging system used for Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). Common among patients with NHL is involvement of the following: Cytological examination of cerebrospinal fluid may be positive in patients with aggressive NHL. Involvement of hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes is less common than in HL. Mediastinal adenopathy, however, is a prominent feature of lymphoblastic lymphoma and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, entities primarily found in young adults. Most patients with NHL present with advanced (stage III or stage IV) disease that can often be identified with limited staging procedures such as CT scanning and biopsies of the bone marrow and other accessible sites of involvement. Laparoscopic biopsy or laparotomy is not required for staging but may be necessary to establish a diagnosis or histological type.[ In a retrospective study of 130 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, PET scanning identified all clinically important marrow involvement from lymphoma, and bone marrow biopsy did not upstage any patient.[ Staging Subclassification System Lugano Classification The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) has adopted the Lugano classification to evaluate SB, Greene FL, et al., eds.:AJCC Cancer Staging Manual. 8th ed. New York, NY: Springer, 2017, pp. 937-58.| |b Stage II bulky may be considered either early or advanced stage based on lymphoma histology and prognostic factors.| |c The definition of disease bulk varies according to lymphoma histology. In the Lugano classification, bulk ln Hodgkin lymphoma is defined as a mass greater than one-third of the thoracic diameter on CT of the chest or a mass >10 cm. For NHL, the recommended definitions of bulk vary by lymphoma histology. In follicular lymphoma, 6 cm has been suggested based on the Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index-2 and its validation. In DLBCL, cutoffs ranging from 5 cm to 10 cm have been used, although 10 cm is recommended.| |Limited stage| |I||Involvement of a single ring, thymus, or spleen).|| | |IE||Single extralymphatic site in the absence of nodal involvement (rare in Hodgkin lymphoma).| |II||Involvement of two or more lymph node regions on the same side of the diaphragm.|| | |IIE||Contiguous extralymphatic extension from a nodal site with or without involvement of other lymph node regions on the same side of the diaphragm.|| | |II bulkyb||Stage II with disease bulk.c| |Advanced stage| |III||Involvement of lymph node regions on both sides of the diaphragm; nodes above the diaphragm with spleen involvement.|| | |IV||Diffuse or disseminated involvement of one or more extralymphatic organs, with or without associated lymph node involvement; or noncontiguous extralymphatic organ involvement in conjunction with nodal stage II disease; or any extralymphatic organ involvement in nodal stage III disease. Stage IV includes any involvement of the CSF, bone marrow, liver, or multiple lung lesions (other than by direct extension in stage IIE disease).|| | |Note: Hodgkin lymphoma uses A or B designation with stage group. A/B is no longer used in NHL.| Occasionally, specialized staging systems are used. The physician should be aware of the system used in a specific report. The E designation is used when extranodal lymphoid malignancies arise in tissues separate from, but near, the major lymphatic aggregates. Stage IV refers to disease that is diffusely spread throughout an extranodal site, such as the liver. If pathological proof of involvement of one or more extralymphatic sites has been documented, the symbol for the site of involvement, followed by a plus sign (+), is listed. |N = nodes||H = liver||L = lung||M = pleura||O = bone||D = skin| Current practice assigns a clinical stage based on the findings of the clinical evaluation and a pathological stage based on the findings made as a result of invasive procedures beyond the initial biopsy. For example, on percutaneous biopsy, a patient with inguinal adenopathy and a positive lymphangiogram without systemic symptoms might have involvement of the liver and bone marrow. The precise stage of such a patient would be clinical stage IIA, pathological stage IVA(H+)(M+). Several other factors that are not included in the above staging system are important for the staging and prognosis of patients with NHL. These factors include the following: The National Comprehensive Cancer Network International Prognostic Index (IPI) for aggressive NHL (diffuse large cell lymphoma) identifies the following five significant risk factors prognostic of overall survival (OS) and their associated risk scores:[ Risk scores: Age-adjusted and stage-adjusted modifications of this IPI are used for younger patients with localized disease.[ The BCL2 gene and rearrangement of the MYC gene or dual overexpression of the MYC gene, or both, confer a particularly poor prognosis.[ References: Treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) depends on the histological type and stage. Many of the improvements in survival have been made using clinical trials (experimental therapy) that have attempted to improve on the best available accepted therapy (conventional or standard therapy). In asymptomatic patients with indolent forms of advanced NHL, treatment may be deferred until the patient becomes symptomatic as the disease progresses. When treatment is deferred, the clinical course of patients with indolent NHL varies; frequent and careful observation is required so that effective treatment can be initiated when the clinical course of the disease accelerates. Some patients have a prolonged indolent course, but others have disease that rapidly evolves into more aggressive types of NHL that require immediate treatment. Radiation techniques differ somewhat from those used in the treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma. The dose of radiation therapy usually varies from 25 Gy to 50 Gy and is dependent on factors that include the histological type of lymphoma, the patient's stage and overall condition, the goal of treatment (curative or palliative), the proximity of sensitive surrounding organs, and whether the patient is being treated with radiation therapy alone or in combination with chemotherapy. Given the patterns of disease presentations and relapse, treatment may need to include unusual sites such as Waldeyer ring, epitrochlear nodes, or mesenteric nodes. The associated morbidity of the treatment must be considered carefully. Most patients who receive radiation are treated on only one side of the diaphragm. Localized presentations of extranodal NHL may be treated with involved-field techniques with significant (>50%) success. |Stage||Treatment Options| |BMT marrow transplantation; cell I and Indolent, Contiguous Stage II |Rituximab with or without chemotherapy| |Watchful therapy| |Lenalidomide and |Obinutuzumab or high-dose radioimmunotherapy followed by autologous or peripheral SCT (under clinical evaluation)| |Phase III clinical trials comparing chemotherapy alone versus chemotherapy followed by anti-idiotype vaccine| |Extended-field radiation therapy (stage III patients only) evaluation)| |Ofatumumab (under clinical evaluation)| |Short-course low-dose, clinical evaluation)| |Indolent, Recurrent NHL||Rituximab alone or in combination with cytotoxic agents used in front-line therapy| |Obinutuzumab alone or in combination with Stage II NHL||R-CHOP with or without IF-XRT| tesirine| Even though existing treatments cure a significant fraction of patients with lymphoma, numerous clinical trials that explore treatment improvements are in progress. If possible, patients can be included in these studies. Standardized guidelines for response assessment have been suggested for use in clinical trials.[ Several retrospective reviews suggest that routine surveillance scans offer little to no value in patients with diffuse-large B-cell lymphoma (DLCBL) who have attained a clinical complete remission after induction therapy. Prognostic value is also difficult to identify for an interim positron emission tomography-computed tomography scan during induction therapy for DLBCL.[ Aggressive lymphomas are increasingly seen in HIV-positive patients. Treatment of these patients requires special consideration. For more information, see AIDS-Related Lymphoma Treatment. In addition to screening for HIV among patients with aggressive lymphomas, active hepatitis B or hepatitis C can be assessed before treatment with rituximab and/or chemotherapy.[ Among 2,508 patients in a Danish registry, the incidence of doxorubicin-induced congestive heart failure increased for 115 NHL survivors with a history of cardiac disease (hazard ratio [HR], 2.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.156.36) and/or multiple cardiovascular risk factors (HR, 2.86; 95% CI, 1.565.23).[ Several unusual presentations of lymphoma occur that often require somewhat modified approaches to staging and therapy. The reader is referred to reviews for a more detailed description of extranodal presentations in the gastrointestinal system,[ For more information, see Primary CNS Lymphoma Treatment. Castleman Disease A biopsy of localized or multifocal collections of lymph nodes may lead to a diagnosis of Castleman disease (CD), although it is an uncommon diagnosis. Strictly speaking, this is not a lymphoma, nor is it even a malignancy. Yet, many patients with CD may be seen and treated by hematologists or oncologists. Localized or unicentric CD is usually asymptomatic and occurs in the mediastinum, which is the most common presentation for CD.[ Current Clinical Trials Use our advanced clinical trial search to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now enrolling patients. The search can be narrowed by location of the trial, type of treatment, name of the drug, and other criteria. General information about clinical trials is also available. References: Localized presentations are uncommon in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The goal of treatment is to cure the disease in patients who have undergone appropriate staging procedures confirming truly localized disease. Treatment Options for Indolent Stage I and Indolent, Contiguous Stage II NHL Treatment options for indolent stage I and indolent, contiguous stage II NHL include the following: In a prospective randomized trial, 150 patients with stage I or stage II follicular lymphoma were randomly assigned to 30 Gy of involved-field radiation therapy alone or radiation therapy plus six cycles of R-CVP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisolone). With a the 10-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate combined-modality confidence interval [CI], 46%-74%) versus 41% for radiation therapy alone (95% CI, 30%-57%) (P = .033). There was no difference in overall survival (OS) (87% and 95%, P = .40).[ The National Lymphocare Study identified 471 patients with stage I follicular lymphoma. Of those patients, 206 were rigorously staged with a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, and tomography (PET)-CT scans.[ Radiation therapy Long-term disease control within radiation fields can be achieved in a significant number of patients with indolent stage I or stage II NHL by using dosages of radiation that usually range from 25 Gy to 40 Gy to involved sites or to extended fields that cover adjacent nodal sites.[ A retrospective review of 512 patients from an international consortium evaluated patients with early-stage follicular lymphoma who received at least 24 Gy of localized radiation therapy at initial presentation. With a median follow-up of 52 months, 29.1% of patients developed recurrent lymphoma at a median of 23 months (range, 1143 months).[ Very low-dose radiation therapy with 4 Gy (2 Gy \u00d7 2 fractions) can result in 50% remission rates for patients who cannot tolerate higher doses.[ In situations in which mediastinal radiation would encompass the left side of the heart or would increase breast cancer risk in young female patients, proton therapy may be considered to reduce the radiation dose to organs at risk.[ Rituximab with or without chemotherapy For symptomatic patients who require therapy, when radiation therapy is contraindicated, or when an alternative treatment is preferred, rituximab with or without chemotherapy can be used (as outlined below for more advanced-stage patients). The value of adjuvant treatment with radiation to decrease relapse, plus rituximab (an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody) either alone or in combination with chemotherapy, has been extrapolated from trials of patients with advanced-stage disease and has not been confirmed.[ Watchful waiting Watchful waiting can be considered for asymptomatic patients.[ Other therapies as designated for patients with advanced-stage disease Patients with involvement that is not able to be encompassed by radiation therapy are treated as outlined for patients with stage III or stage IV low-grade lymphoma. Current Clinical Trials Use our advanced clinical trial search to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now enrolling patients. The search can be narrowed by location of the trial, type of treatment, name of the drug, and other criteria. General information about clinical trials is also available. References: Optimal treatment of advanced stages of low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is controversial because of low cure rates with the current therapeutic options. Numerous clinical trials are in progress to evaluate treatment issues, and patients are urged to participate. The rate of relapse is fairly constant over time, even in patients who have achieved complete response to treatment. Indeed, relapse may occur many years after treatment. Currently, no randomized trials provide guidance to clinicians about the initial choice of watchful waiting, rituximab, nucleoside analogs, alkylating agents, combination chemotherapy, radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies, or combinations of these options.[ For patients with indolent, noncontiguous stage II and stage III NHL, central lymphatic radiation therapy has been proposed but is not usually recommended as a form of treatment.[ Patients with a resolved hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (defined as hepatitis B surface antigen-negative but hepatitis B core antibody-positive) are at risk of reactivation of HBV and require monitoring of HBV DNA. therapy lowered HBV reactivation from 10.8% to 2.1% in a retrospective study of 326 patients.[ Treatment Options for Indolent, Noncontiguous Stage II/III/IV NHL Treatment options for indolent, noncontiguous stage II/III/IV NHL include the following: Because none of the therapies listed above are curative for advanced-stage disease, innovative approaches are under clinical evaluation. Watchful waiting for asymptomatic patients The rate of relapse is fairly constant over time, even in patients who have achieved complete responses (CR) to treatment. Indeed, relapse may occur many years after treatment. In this category, deferred treatment (i.e., watchful waiting until the patient becomes symptomatic before initiating treatment) can be considered.[ Evidence (watchful waiting): Rituximab alone or in combination with cytotoxic agents used in front-line therapy Standard therapy includes rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, either alone, as was shown in the ECOG-E4402 trial (NCT00075946),[ Evidence (rituximab with or without chemotherapy): the immunomodulating agent lenalidomide with rituximab (the so-called R2 regimen) has been proposed as an alternative regimen to combinations involving cytotoxic agents and their subsequent short- and long-term toxicities. Evidence (lenalidomide and rituximab): This trial established that the R2 regimen is equally efficacious to rituximab plus cytotoxic chemotherapy options; analysis of long-term toxicities must await longer follow-up. Maintenance rituximab After induction therapy with rituximab only or with rituximab plus chemotherapy, rituximab can be used once every 2 to 3 months. Several studies have evaluated this approach. Evidence (maintenance rituximab for previously untreated patients): These three randomized trials in previously untreated patients show no advantage for the use of rituximab maintenance versus observation and reinduction of therapy at the time of relapse. The trials suggest a benefit for maintenance rituximab after reinduction for relapsed disease. Many questions remain about rituximab maintenance, particularly about truncating therapy at 2 years and long-term safety and efficacy. A trial extending rituximab maintenance to 5 years showed similar EFS or OS versus 1 year of maintenance after induction therapy with rituximab in previously untreated patients.[ For previously untreated patients, all of the studies showed improvement of PFS, with no change in OS. Evidence (maintenance rituximab for previously treated patients): For previously treated patients, there is more evidence to suggest an OS advantage with the use of rituximab maintenance. Obinutuzumab alone or in combination with cytotoxic agents used in front-line therapy Obinutuzumab is a glycoengineered type II anti-CD20 monoclonal with greater antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity than rituximab. Evidence (obinutuzumab): Several issues have been raised about this study: In summary, in the absence of any change in OS, switching from rituximab to obinutuzumab in combination with chemotherapy for previously untreated follicular lymphoma is a difficult choice. The PFS differences may be attributable to the imbalance in monoclonal antibody dosing, and the increased side effects and costs are mitigating factors. In this trial, bendamustine combined with either antibody led to unacceptable rates of toxic death. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor Copanlisib Evidence (copanlisib): The adverse effects, including pneumonitis, colitis, transaminitis, hypertension, hyperglycemia, rash, and increased risk of infections. These adverse events have affected the use of these agents until confirmatory trial results can establish their efficacy and safety.[ EZH2 methyltransferase essential to the formation of lymph node germinal centers, especially with activating mutations of EZH2. Evidence (tazemetostat): anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies Yttrium Y 90 tiuxetan (Zevalin) is available for previously untreated and relapsing patients with minimal (<25%) or no marrow involvement with lymphoma (iodine I 131 [131I]-tositumomab [Bexxar] is no longer available of commercial disengagement).[ Evidence (radiolabeled anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies): 131I-tositumomab became commercially unavailable in 2013. responses to radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies, such as 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan (commercially available) and iodine I 131-tositumomab (commercially unavailable), have also been reported before and after cytotoxic chemotherapy.[ Current Clinical Trials Use our advanced clinical trial search to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now enrolling patients. The search can be narrowed by location of the trial, type of treatment, name of the drug, and other criteria. General information about clinical trials is also available. References: In general, treatment with standard agents rarely produces a cure in patients whose disease has relapsed. Sustained remissions after relapse can often be obtained in patients with indolent lymphomas, but relapse will usually ensue. Favorable survival after relapse has been associated with an age younger than 60 years, complete remission rather than partial remission, and duration of response longer than 2 years.[ Patients who experience a relapse with indolent lymphoma can often have their disease controlled with single agent or combination chemotherapy, rituximab (an palliative radiation therapy.[ In a retrospective review of 325 patients between 1972 and 1999, the risk of histological transformation was 30% by 10 years from diagnosis.[ A prospective trial of 631 patients with follicular lymphoma and with a median follow-up of 60 months in the rituximab era (2002-2009) found a 5-year transformation rate (11%) to a higher-grade histology.[ For descriptions of the regimens used to treat histological conversions, see the Treatment of Aggressive, Recurrent NHL section. The durability of the second remission may be short, and clinical trials can be considered. Treatment Options for Indolent, Recurrent NHL Treatment options for indolent, recurrent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) include the following: Rituximab alone or in combination with cytotoxic agents used in front-line therapy Rituximab results in a 40% to 50% response rate in patients who relapse with indolent B-cell lymphomas.[ Evidence (rituximab): Obinutuzumab alone or in combination with cytotoxic agents used in front-line therapy Obinutuzumab is a CD20-binding monoclonal antibody with alternative binding. (obinutuzumab): Lenalidomide and rituximab Responses of 20% to 56% have been reported for lenalidomide, especially in patients with follicular lymphoma and small lymphocytic lymphoma, with even higher responses noted for the and adverse effects, including pneumonitis, colitis, transaminitis, hypertension, hyperglycemia, rash, and increased risk of infections. These adverse events have affected the use of these agents until confirmatory trials can establish their efficacy in combinations. They are currently approved for treatment of relapsed and refractory follicular lymphoma after two previously received lines of Tazemetostat is an inhibitor of EZH2, a methyltransferase essential to the formation of lymph node germinal centers, especially with activating mutations of EZH2. Evidence (tazemetostat): Palliative radiation therapy Palliation may be achieved with very low-dose (4 Gy) involved-field radiation therapy in two fractions for patients with indolent and aggressive relapsed disease.[ Chemotherapy (single agent or combination) Patients may respond to the original induction regimen again, especially if the duration of remission exceeds 1 year. For relapsing patients, rituximab alone or in combination with agents not previously used may induce remissions. For more information, see the Rituximab alone or in combination with cytotoxic agents used in front-line therapy section. Radiolabeled anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies Durable responses to radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies, such as yttrium Y 90 (90Y)-ibritumomab tiuxetan (commercially available) and iodine I 131-tositumomab (commercially unavailable), have also been reported before and after cytotoxic chemotherapy.[ Evidence (radiolabeled anti-CD20 with axicabtagene ciloleucel, an autologous anti-CD19 therapy, has been approved for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Evidence (CAR T-cell therapy): CAR T cells are being used for high-risk patients whose disease has relapsed rapidly after chemoimmunotherapy. Such an approach is considered in the context of numerous other available agents. Stem cell transplantation In many institutions, autologous or allogeneic SCTs are being used for high-risk patients whose disease has relapsed rapidly after chemoimmunotherapy. Such an approach is considered in the context of numerous other available agents.[ Evidence (SCT): Current Clinical Trials Use our advanced clinical trial search to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now enrolling patients.

References: Patients with aggressive stage I or aggressive, contiguous stage II diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) are candidates for combination chemotherapy with or without involved-field radiation therapy (IF-XRT). Patients with a resolved hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (defined as hepatitis B surface antigen-negative but hepatitis B core antibody-positive) are at risk of reactivation of HBV and require monitoring of HBV DNA. therapy lowered HBV reactivation from 10.8% to 2.1% in a retrospective study of 326 patients.[ Treatment Options for Aggressive Stage I and Aggressive, Contiguous Stage II NHL Treatment options for aggressive stage I and aggressive, contiguous stage II non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) include the following: R-CHOP with or without IF-XRT The confirmation of efficacy for rituximab in advanced-stage disease has suggested the use of R-CHOP with or without radiation therapy but its use is only supported by retrospective comparisons.[ Evidence (R-CHOP with or without IF-XRT): Similar to the results of randomized studies of radiation therapy in the prerituximab era, radiation therapy can be deferred in nonbulky early-stage patients. For patients unable to tolerate prolonged-course chemotherapy, three cycles of R-CHOP plus radiation therapy has produced equivalent results based on single-arm retrospective trials.[ In summary, for patients with favorable prognosis nonbulky (<7 cm) stage I or stage II DLBCL, four cycles of R-CHOP is sufficient. For patients with unfavorable prognosis, six cycles of R-CHOP or three cycles of R-CHOP and 40 Gy of radiation therapy can be used. Early-stage patients with bulky disease (>7.5 cm) have not been studied in randomized trials; combined-modality therapy with R-CHOP for four to six cycles plus radiation therapy is usually chosen.

The search can be narrowed by location of the trial, type of treatment, name of the drug, and other criteria. General information about clinical trials is also available. References: The treatment of choice for patients with advanced stages of aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is combination chemotherapy, either alone or supplemented by local-field radiation therapy.[ The following drug combinations are referred to in this section: Treatment Options for Aggressive, Noncontiguous Stage II/III/IV NHL Treatment options for aggressive, noncontiguous stage II/III/IV NHL include the following: R-CHOP The following studies established R-CHOP as the standard regimen for newly diagnosed patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).[ Evidence (R-CHOP): Modifications to R-CHOP to achieve improved efficacy continue to be explored in clinical trials. For over 2 decades, this has remained the worldwide standard induction therapy. Pola-R-CHP R-CHOP inhibitor. Evidence (Pola-R-CHP): The follow-up interval was too short to establish whether the 6% improvement in the PFS rate will plateau or improve after 2 years, and there is no evidence of OS advantage. Nonetheless, physician advisory panels are considering whether this represents a new standard regimen to replace R-CHOP. The new regimen is more than twice the cost of R-CHOP using acquisition prices in 2022. There is no validated trial for interim positron emission tomography-based treatment intensification.[ Less than 10% of patients with DLBCL present with a concurrent indolent lymphoma at diagnosis, and these are predominantly of germinal center B-cell phenotype. A retrospective review of 1,324 patients showed similar EFS (HR, 1.19) and OS (HR, 1.09).[ Stage IE or IIE gastric DLBCL Four case series involving more than 100 patients with stage IE or IIE disease (with or without associated mucosa-associated lymphatic tissue) and with positive Helicobacter pylori infection reported that more than 50% of patients attained a durable complete remission after appropriate antibiotic therapy to eradicate H. pylori.[ Prognostic factors The National Comprehensive Cancer Network IPI for aggressive NHL (diffuse large cell lymphoma) identifies the following five significant risk factors prognostic of OS and their associated risk scores:[ Risk scores: Age-adjusted and stage-adjusted modifications of this IPI are used for younger patients with localized disease.[ The BCL2 gene and rearrangement of the MYC gene or dual overexpression of the MYC gene, or both, confer a particularly poor prognosis.[ Treatment of tumor lysis syndrome Patients with bulky and extensive lymphadenopathy and elevations of serum uric acid and LDH are at increased risk of tumor lysis syndrome resulting in metabolic derangements such as failure.[ CNS CNS-IPI tool predicts which patients have a CNS relapse risk exceeding 10%. It was developed by the German Lymphoma Study Group and validated by the British Columbia Cancer Agency database. The presence of four to six of the CNS-IPI risk factors (age >60 years, performance status 2, elevated LDH, stage III or IV disease, >1 extranodal site, or involvement of the kidneys or adrenal glands) was used to define a high-risk group for CNS recurrence (a 12% risk of CNS involvement by 2 years).[ CNS prophylaxis (usually with four to six doses of intrathecal methotrexate) is often recommended for patients with testicular involvement.[ The addition of rituximab to CHOP-based regimens has significantly reduced the risk of relapse in retrospective analyses.[ BMT or SCT Several randomized trials evaluated the role of autologous BMT or SCT consolidation versus chemotherapy alone in patients with diffuse large cell lymphoma in first remission.[ Retrospective analyses of high-intermediate (two risk factors) or high-risk (more than three risk factors) patients as defined by IPI suggest improved survival with BMT in two of the trials.[ Radiation therapy consolidation to sites of bulky disease After R-CHOP induction chemotherapy (or similar regimens), the addition of involved-field radiation therapy to sites of initial bulky disease (5-10 cm) or to extralymphatic sites remains controversial.[ Current Clinical Trials Use our advanced clinical trial search to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now enrolling patients.

References: Treatment Options for Aggressive, Recurrent NHL In a retrospective review of multiple international trials, 636 patients were identified as having refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), which was defined as progression or stable disease during or just at completion of full-course chemotherapy or relapse within 1 year after autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT).[ Treatment options for aggressive, recurrent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) include the following: CAR T-cell therapy for primary refractory disease or relapse within one year Patients with DLBCL who relapse during or within 2 months of receiving R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) chemotherapy have primary refractory disease. Any patient with disease relapse within 1 year of R-CHOP chemotherapy or with primary refractory disease has a poor prognosis even with reinduction using chemoimmunotherapy followed by autologous SCT.[ Three randomized chemoimmunotherapy followed by autologous SCT with CAR T-cell therapy with or without bridging chemoimmunotherapy for patients with high-risk relapsed disease defined as primary refractory disease or relapse within 12 months of initial R-CHOP therapy. Evidence (CAR T-cell therapy): In summary: Bone marrow/stem cell transplantation consolidation BMT consolidation is a treatment for patients whose lymphoma has relapsed.[ Evidence (BMT): In general, patients who responded to initial therapy and who responded to conventional therapy for relapse before the BMT have had the best results.[ Peripheral SCT has yielded results equivalent to standard autologous SCT.[ Evidence (peripheral SCT): CAR T-cell therapy for relapse after autologous SCT In the event of disease relapse after autologous SCT, many patients receive consolidation with CAR T-cell therapy.

References: LBL is a very aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), which often occurs in young patients but not exclusively. LBL is the lymphomatous manifestation of ALL. The treatment paradigms are based on trials for ALL because LBL and ALL are considered different manifestations of the same biological disease. LBL is commonly associated with large mediastinal masses and has a high predilection for disseminating to bone marrow and the central nervous system (CNS). Intensive combination chemotherapy with CNS prophylaxis is the standard treatment of this aggressive histological type of NHL. Radiation therapy is sometimes given to areas of bulky tumor masses. Because these forms of NHL tend to progress quickly, combination chemotherapy is instituted rapidly once the diagnosis has been confirmed. For more information, see Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment. The most important aspects of the pretreatment staging workup include careful review of the following pathological specimens: Treatment Options for LBL/ALL Treatment options for LBL include the following: New treatment approaches are being developed by the national cooperative groups. Other approaches include the use of bone marrow transplantation for consolidation. For more information, see Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment.

References: General Information About NHL During Pregnancy Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) occur more frequently than Hodgkin lymphoma in an older population. This age difference may account for fewer reports of NHL in pregnant patients.[ Stage Information for NHL During Pregnancy To avoid exposure to ionizing radiation, magnetic resonance imaging is the preferred tool for staging evaluation.[ Treatment Option Overview for NHL During Pregnancy |Stage||Treatment Options| |Indolent NHL During Pregnancy||Delay delivery, when feasible| |Termination of pregnancy| Indolent NHL During Pregnancy Treatment may be delayed for those women with an indolent NHL. Aggressive NHL During Pregnancy Immediate therapy According to anecdotal case series, most NHLs in pregnant patients are aggressive, and delay of therapy until after delivery appears to have poor outcomes.[ A multicenter retrospective analysis of 50 patients described pregnancy termination in 3 patients, deferral of therapy to postpartum in 15 patients (median 30 weeks gestation), and antenatal therapy applied to the remaining 32 patients (median 21 weeks gestation, all done after the first trimester).[ Early delivery when feasible For some women, early delivery, when feasible, may minimize or avoid exposure to chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Termination of pregnancy Termination of pregnancy in the first trimester may be an option that allows immediate therapy for women with aggressive NHL.

This section describes the latest changes made to this summary as of the date above. This summary was renamed from Adult Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment. General Information About Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) Updated statistics with estimated new cases and deaths for 2023 (cited American Cancer Society as reference 2). Indolent NHL Added text to state that an alternative prognostic index using only noninvasive clinical variables outperformed the Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI), FLIPI-2, and PRIMA-PI, using data from immunochemotherapy trials (cited Mir et al. as reference 16). Revised text to state that three retrospective analyses identified a high-risk group that had a 50% overall survival (OS) rate at 5 years when relapses occurred within 24 months of induction chemoimmunotherapy (cited Casulo et al. as reference 16). Added De Leo et al. as reference 89. Aggressive NHL Added text about a retrospective study that evaluated patients who received central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis with intrathecal methotrexate, high-dose intravenous (IV) There was no difference in CNS relapse rates between patients who received intrathecal methotrexate. Testicular involvement, high extranodal involvement predicted increased CNS relapse regardless of the route of prophylaxis (cited Orellana-Noia et al. as reference 30). Added text to state that most patients with breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) have a characteristic deletion at 20Q13.13 that may help diagnostically to distinguish it from cutaneous or systemic ALCL (cited Los-de Vries et al. as reference 74). Added text about the use of pegaspargase as systemic therapy for extranodal natural killer-/T-cell lymphoma (cited Liang et al. and Wang et al. as references 98 and 99, respectively). Added text to state that, in a trial evaluating bendamustine and rituximab with or without ibrutinib in patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), the magnitude of benefit demonstrated by the progression-free survival (PFS) results contrasted with the insufficient OS benefit after 7 years casts doubt on the long-term safety of the ibrutinib, bendamustine, and rituximab combination. Added text about the results of a phase II study of the Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor zanubrutinib in of 86 patients with relapsed or refractory MCL (cited Song et al. as reference 224 and level of evidence C3). Added text to state that the optimal sequencing of various therapies for patients with MCL is unclear and is the subject of an ongoing Intergroup clinical trial. Rituximab, lenalidomide, ibrutinib, acalabrutinib, venetoclax, and zanubrutinib represent directed biological agents that may lead to chemotherapy-free treatment strategies. Treatment Option Overview for NHL Revised Table 4, Treatment Options for NHL. Treatment of Indolent, Noncontiguous Stage II/III/IV NHL Added text about the results of the FOLL12 study of patients with previously untreated high-tumor burden follicular lymphoma who received rituximab plus chemotherapy induction and were randomly assigned to either standard rituximab maintenance or response-based postinduction treatment. Revised text to state that adverse events have affected the use of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors until confirmatory trial results can establish their efficacy and safety (cited Richardson et al. as reference 70). Treatment of Aggressive, Recurrent NHL Revised text to state that patients who received chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy had a 40% to 50% 3-year PFS rate with a 40-month follow-up (cited Cappell et al. as reference 6). Treatment of Diffuse, Small Noncleaved-Cell/Burkitt Lymphoma Added Roschewski et al. as reference 4.
