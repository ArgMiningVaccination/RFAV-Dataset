Plate on antibiotic selection plates and incubate overnight at 37\u00b0C. - Resuspend a single colony in 10 ml liquid culture with antibiotic. - Incubate at 37\u00b0C until OD600 reaches 0.4 - 0.8. - Induce with 40 \u00b5l of a 100 mM stock of IPTG (final concentration of 0.4 mM) and induce for 2 hours at 37\u00b0C. - Check for expression either by Coomassie stained protein gel, Western Blot or activity assay. Check expression in both the total cell extract (soluble + insoluble) and the soluble fraction alone. - For large scale, inoculate 1 L of liquid medium (with antibiotic) with a freshly grown colony or 10 ml of freshly grown culture. Incubate at 37\u00b0C until OD600 reaches 0.4 - 0.8. Add IPTG to 0.4 mM. Induce 2 hours. "}
