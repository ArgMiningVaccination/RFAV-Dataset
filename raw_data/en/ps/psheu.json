Be attentive to the needs of others when listening and responding to feedback from staff, clinicians and consumers. Excellence : Be prepared for change and strive for continuous learning and quality improvements. Acknowledge and reward innovation in practice and outcomes. Develop and contribute to an environment where every member of the team is the right person for their job, and is empowered to perform to the highest possible standard. Collaboration : Actively communicate to achieve the best results by giving time, attention and effort to others. Respect and acknowledge everyone's input, skills and experience by working together and contributing to solutions. Share knowledge and resources willingly with your colleagues. Integrity : Be open, honest and trustworthy when communicating with others, and ensure correct information is provided in a timely way. Be accountable, reflective and open to feedback. Be true to yourself, your profession, consumers, colleagues and the government.

Director Division of Clinical Support Services Adrian Scott SECTION B ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMACE11 ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMANCEEnvironment and the planning framework To contribute to the broader ACT Government vision, ACT Health's vision is 'Your Health\u2014Our Priority' . This vision is supported by a range of strategic plans that identify objectives for the organisation. There is recognition that the demand for health services is increasing every year. Expanding health technologies, consumer expectation and an increasing and ageing population all contribute to this demand. The Corporate Plan articulates: key focus areas priorities for improvement key strategies for achieving the priorities achievements planned for the long term (five years). In 2014-15, ACT Health continued to measure its performance against these areas through: key performance measures identified in the ACT Public Health Service's quarterly performance report ACT Health's strategic and accountability indicator sets in the ACT Budget Papers. The target achievements for each year are contained in ACT Health's Business Plan. Summary of performance ACT Health performed well against a range of strategic objectives and priorities over the reporting period. The ACT continues to enjoy the highest life expectancy of any jurisdiction in Australia. Life expectancy at birth is: 85.0 years for females in the ACT , against a national average of 84.3 years 81.7 years for males, against a national average of 80.1 years. This indicates the general health of the population and reflects on a range of issues other than providing health services, such as economic and environmental factors. More information: For more information, see Strategic Objective 9: Management of Chronic Disease: Maintenance of the Highest Life Expectancy at Birth in Australia , page 44. ACT Health saw 100 per cent of emergency dental clients within 24 hours and achieved lower than the national rate in the Decayed, Missing, or Filled Teeth (DMFT) index at ages six years and 12 years.The DMFT index at six years in the ACT rate was 1.03, compared to the national rate of 2.13. At 12 years the ACT rate was 0.70, compared to the national rate of 1.05. This is the lowest of all jurisdictions.

More information: For more information, see Strategic Objective 1: Removals from Waiting List for Elective Surgery , page 37. 100 per cent of urgent, 95 per cent of semi-urgent and 99 per cent of non-urgent radiotherapy patients commenced treatment within standard timeframes. All three urgency categories reported better than target results in 2014-15. More information: For more information, see Strategic Objective 3: Improving Timeliness of Access to Radiotherapy Services , page 40. 55 per cent of women in the target age group (50 to 69 years) had a breast screen in the 24 months before each counting period. This is slightly below the 2014-15 target of 60 per cent. More information: For more information, see Strategic Objective 4: Improving the Breast Screen Participation Rate for Women aged 50 to 69 years , page 40. The ACT comfortably exceeded the national rate of expenditure on infrastructure. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) reported that in 2010-11, the ACT recorded an investment rate of 3.84 per cent (against a national rate of 2.15 per cent) in capital expenditure on healthcare infrastructure. More information: For more information, see Strategic Objective 12: Government capital expenditure on healthcare infrastructure , page 45. Reflecting ACT Health's priority of reducing the long-term chronic disease burden, the AIHW also reported that in 2010-11 the ACT recorded a rate of 2.6 per cent (against a national average of 2.1 per cent) for total government expenditure on public health activities as a proportion of total current health expenditure. More information: For more information, see Strategic Objective 13: Higher proportion of Government recurrent health funding expenditure on public health activities than the national average , page 82.ACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-1512For the two-year participation rate in the Cervical Screening Program, the ACT achieved 57.9 per cent, which is a slight increase on the national average of 57.8 per cent and demonstrates the effectiveness of early intervention health messages. More information: For more information, see Strategic Objective 15: Higher Participation Rate in the Cervical Screening Program than the National Average , page 46. ACT Health met its responsiveness target for the Aged Care Assessment Team (ACAT) of two days to assess the needs of clients for patients in public hospitals. More information: For more information, see Strategic Objective 5: Maintaining the waiting times for in hospital assessments by the Aged Care Assessment Team , page 41. Public mental health services were effective in providing care to mental health clients, with only 6 per cent of clients returning to hospital within 28 days of discharge from an ACT public acute psychiatric unit following an acute episode of care. This is 4 per cent below the target of 10 per cent. More information: For more information, see Strategic Objective 7: Maintaining Reduced Rates of Patient Return to an ACT Public Acute Psychiatric Inpatient Unit , page 42. ACT public hospitals achieved an average bed occupancy rate of 85 per cent in 2014-15, an improvement on the 90 per cent reported for 2013-14.

In 2013-14, the ACT rate of admissions in persons aged 75 years and over with a fractured neck of femur was 6.7 per 1,000 persons in the ACT population. This is slightly above the long-term target and follows a generally decreasing trend over the 10-year period from 2001-02. More information: For more information, see Strategic Objective 17: Reducing the Risk of Fractured Femurs in ACT Residents Aged Over 75 years , page 46. The prevalence of diabetes in the ACT , of 3.8 per cent, was similar to the national rate of 3.7 per cent. More information: For more information, see Strategic Objective 11: Lower Prevalence of Diabetes than the National Average , page 44.Overall, the ACT Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander immunisation rate of 90.5 per cent indicates a high level of investment in public health services to minimise the incidence of vaccine preventable diseases among the ACT's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population. More information: For more information, see Strategic Objective 14: Addressing Gaps in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Immunisation Status , page 45. Results from the 2011 Australian Secondary School Alcohol and Drug Survey (ASSAD) show that 5.8 per cent of students were current smokers in that year, well below the national average. This demonstrates a continued decline in smoking, from 15.3 per cent in 2001 to 5.8 per cent in 2011. More information: For more information, see Strategic Objective 18: Reduction in the Youth Smoking Rate , page 46. Our public hospitals continue to exceed national and local benchmarks for: hand hygiene rates hospital-acquired infection rates unplanned return to hospital within 28 days unplanned return to the operating theatre. More information: For detailed information, see the ACT Local Hospital Network strategic objectives and indicators , page 47. Outlook for 2015-16 Although there are many challenges in the year ahead, 2015-16 promises to be another year of growth and achievement for ACT Health. The ACT Government continues to invest heavily in public healthcare to meet both present and future challenges. Health continues to be one of the ACT Government's biggest areas of investment, with a commitment of $1.42 billion in recurrent spending for health services for the people of the ACT and surrounding NSW in 2015-16. More general inpatient beds and intensive care beds will be opened. This will be complemented by additional Hospital in the Home (HITH) places. Outpatient services in cancer, women, youth and children and other outpatient clinics will continue to be expanded.SECTION B ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMACE13 ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMANCEIn addition, more support will be for available for: people affected by suicide mental health suicide prevention awareness and research. The 2015-16, the ACT Budget provides $6.2 million (and $8.4 million in a full year) to significantly enhance mental health services. This funding is allocated to increase current services and provide new interventions to better meet client needs. All of the funding is directed at community-based service responses and is in line with the ACT Government's aim of ensuring that care is provided in the least invasive environment possible for any condition. Along with this investment in mental health services, we will be continuing the work to transform other aspects of our services, through innovation and redesign, to deliver the most care in the most cost- efficient and effective way. Working collaboratively with healthcare consumers and the primary care sector will be central to achieving this objective. This approach will complement the work done on models of care through the HIP . The continued investment in new e-health services will also support service delivery transformation. Under the HIP , work will commence on: the University of Canberra Public Hospital (UCPH) and the Secure Mental Health Unit (SMHU) the expansion of the Emergency Department at Canberra Hospital a range of staging and decanting projects. The Healthy Weight Initiative will also remain a key focus for ACT Health as part of the whole-of- government initiative to reduce the incidence of obesity in our population.

It provides acute, subacute, primary and community-based health services to the ACT and surrounding region through its key service divisions, which are: Division of Surgery, Oral Health and Imaging Division of Women, Youth and Children Division of Critical Care Division of Cancer, Ambulatory and Community Health Support Division of Rehabilitation, Aged and Community Care Division of Mental Health, Justice Health, Alcohol and Drug Services Division of Pathology Division of Medicine Division of Clinical Support Services The Office of the Chief Nurse The Office of the Chief Medical Administrator The Office of the Chief Allied Health Officer HealthCARE Improvement Division. Achievements The Acute Surgical Unit (ASU) commenced in April 2015 and is staffed and run by consultants at Canberra Hospital. The ASU admits patients who have been assessed as likely to require a surgical procedure and aims to maximise access to emergency theatre time for suitable patients. The ASU has access to a dedicated theatre list from Monday to Friday. The Mobile Dental Clinic was launched in January 2015. The purpose-built truck is improving access to dental health services for Canberrans residing in aged care facilities. In the first six months it visited seven facilities, providing a range of preventative, restorative and denture services. A new Cardiac Catheter Diagnostic Suite (CCDS) was installed in the Cardiology Department at Canberra Hospital in 2014. This has provided enhanced clinical services for our patients. The CCDS brings a new imaging performance, enabling the clinician to ultimately treat the patient faster, with more precision and with added confidence for enhanced patient outcomes. The CCDS is the first of its kind in the ACT . ACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-1516An Adult Community Mental Health Model of Care redesign project delivered a preliminary Model of Care and high-level implementation plan. It is anticipated that this redesign will support community mental healthcare that is evidence- based, contemporary and better meets the needs of the expanding Canberra community. The Community Nursing and Allied Health performance exceeded the 2014-15 targets for: number of nursing occasions of service, which was set at 82,000 number of allied health regional services, which was set at 22,600. This was achieved by: recruiting additional allied health and nursing positions, which expanded community- based services implementing changed models of care. ACT Health undertook an extensive transformational policy redesign project, which reviewed over 1,800 policies across Canberra Hospital and Health Services. The project significantly reduced the number of policies housed on the ACT Health Policy Register and improved our evidence base to ensure clinical reliability. The Respecting Patient Choices Program signed a two-year agreement with the Health Care Consumers Association (HCCA) to assist in increasing awareness of Advance Care Planning. It particularly focuses on: disadvantaged groups Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) groups. Extended visiting hours at Canberra Hospital were implemented after a successful trial. Visiting hours are now 6.00 am to 9.00 pm. Outlook for 2015-16 The Mental Health (Treatment and Care) Amendment Act 2014 will be implemented on March 2016. A training program is being developed to ensure that all staff are familiar with their responsibilities under the new Act. A community mental health team will be established for the Gungahlin region. Currently, services are provided to this area as an extension from the Belconnen Mental Health Team.The current community Adult Model of Care will be redesigned to ensure an improved integrated flow of patients from both inpatient and community settings\u2014crisis, assertive outreach, clinic- and home-based care. Enhancements to the Model of Care for both the Discharge Lounge and Medi-Hotel are planned. The aim is to improve access to the services and improve patient flow for patients being discharged from the hospital. A breast screening clinic will open at the Belconnen Community Health Centre (BCHC) in the latter half of 2015. This will increase accessibility and ensure an increased capacity to accommodate the expansion of the target age group to target women aged 70-74 years. ACT Pathology will introduce a pilot electronic ward ordering system that will improve the accuracy and timeliness of pathology orders. The Dementia Care in Hospitals Program will be implemented. The program aims to raise awareness and support for more dementia-friendly and supportive environments in Canberra Hospital. Canberra Hospital will also enhance patient care by developing an Acute Stroke Pathway. It is developing, in collaboration with the ACT Ambulance Service and Calvary Public Hospital, an evidence-based, widely-endorsed pathway for caring for acute stroke patients across the territory. Strategy and Corporate Overview The Strategy and Corporate Group: supports national health reforms and National Partnership Agreements develops strategies for attracting and retaining the health workforce maintains critical physical and technological infrastructure for the ACT's public hospitals and health services. The Strategy and Corporate Division consists of seven branches: Policy and Government Relations Business and Infrastructure People, Strategy and Services Performance Information eHealth and Clinical Records Academic Unit of General Practice Canberra Region Medical Education Council (CRMEC).SECTION B ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMACE17 ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMANCEQuality and Safety transferred to the Canberra Hospital and Health Services Division in 2013-14. Strategy and Corporate administers ACT Health's contract for the provision of public hospital services by Calvary Health Care ACT at Bruce and at Clare Holland House, and supports these close working relationships. Calvary Health Care ACT's report on its achievements in 2014-15 is provided in an annexed report. More information: Attachments , Annexed and subsumed public authority reports , Calvary Health Care , page 243. Much of the work supported by Strategy and Corporate is discussed elsewhere in this report; however, other highlights for the division during this reporting period are discussed in this section. National Disability Insurance Scheme The National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) was launched on 1 July 2014 and its implementation continues across ACT Health. Strategy and Corporate's work in this area includes: financial planning service configuration community sector contracting assisting with its phasing in for clients of ACT Health services workforce issues. During 2014-15, ACT Health and contracted providers began transitioning clients and funding into the NDIS. ACT Health is working closely with the ACT Government NDIS Taskforce and the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) to support clients and services through the transition period. The commencement of the NDIS and the associated planning and implementation requirements are significant for the Division of Mental Health, Justice Health and Alcohol and Drug Services. An implementation plan has been developed to ensure: appropriate services are available for eligible people for the transition of care arrangements to the NDIS support those people who may not be eligible or who may have difficulties accessing these services. Rehabilitation, Aged and Community Care (RACC) is a registered service provider to the NDIS. Procedures have been implemented to: identify NDIS clients at intake capture service delivery activity in the ACT Patient Administration System (ACTPAS) raise notional or actual claims to the NDIS for services delivered. ACT Equipment Services (ACTES) is providing funding assistance to clients who are involved in the initial NDIS planning process. The funding aims to meet a client's ongoing needs until their planning process is completed. The ACT NDIS trial will conclude with all eligible residents to be phased in by 2016. Nationally, preparation continues for the implementation of the full scheme. ACTES will still be required to operate to provide funding assistance to NDIS ineligible clients, who are clients who: need items not covered by the NDIS are over the age of 65 years with lower incomes. RACC will continue to strengthen systems for identifying potentially eligible clients, ascertaining whether they have an NDIS plan, and encouraging them to register with the NDIS. RACC will continue to work collaboratively with: the NDIA to promote timely, appropriate and seamless service delivery to clients with disabilities the NDIA and other ACT Government directorates to contribute lessons learnt from the trial, promote inter-sectoral resolution of issues, and work towards the development of a full scheme. In April 2014, the ACT Government announced that, due to the implementation of the NDIS, it would withdraw from providing: early intervention services in 2014 therapy services by December 2016. To provide continuity of service during the NDIS trial, a collaborative approach to service provision was undertaken from January 2015 as Stage 1 of the Child Development Service (CDS). This provided: therapy intervention for children not eligible or not yet phased for the NDIS, which continues to be provided by Therapy ACT early development groups for children not eligible for early intervention services funded by NDIS, which were run through child and family centres by Early Childhood Teachers funded by the Education and Training Directorate (ETD) co-locating at Therapy ACT Holder of Community Paediatricians (Health) and Early Intervention Psychologists (ETD) to provide developmental and health assessment.ACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-1518The CDS proposes that current services be redesigned to achieve: streamlined access to allied health and medical assessment for children who are ACT residents and at risk of developmental delay referral to appropriate services including the NDIS a model of intervention and support for those children not eligible for the NDIS, including group programs and parent support. Depending on the assessed need, this may include time limited, episodic interventions and/or referral to mainstream services, such as playgroups or parenting programs for children at risk of developmental delay and their parents. ACT Health is working closely with the Community Services Directorate to progress this work. Real-time reporting For the first time, ACT Health is using real-time reporting to help clients make decisions about the best treatment options available to them. These initiatives improve the patient journey and contribute to the sustainability of the health service. A web-based report named ED Live was developed during the reporting period and released to the public in July 2014. The website, the first for the territory, reports on the current status of the two public hospital Emergency Departments. Clients can use this information to decide which service to access, and consider alternative services for less urgent medical needs. ED Live was developed in line with the Government's Open Data Strategy. The Performance Information Portal (PIP) allows ACT Health users to: view real-time activity in many areas of the organisation access historical trends and activities in particular areas of its operations. Further developments have been rolled out during 2014-15, including a theatre utilisation module and a bed management tool. Centralised Waitlist Service Performance Information Branch will build an improved elective surgery site for public viewing in 2016. The site intends to provide users with information on surgical waiting lists for differing specialist groups and the surgeons within each group. The site will allow users of public hospital elective surgery facilities to become more informed about potential waiting times, and assists them in making informed decisions about the doctors undertaking their care.The site is being built in response to the Auditor- General's Report No. 1 of 2011: Waiting Lists for Elective Surgery and Medical Treatment report, which recommended establishing a single waiting list across the territory. While the Centralised Waitlist Service (CWLS) is not a single wait list, it is the first stage in progressing to this concept. This continues to be progressed in 2015. The main features of the CWLS are: All Request for Admission forms (RFAs) are received into the CWLS and patients are added to the elective surgery waiting list. All RFAs have previously been managed at individual hospital sites. Clinicians can specify a surgery location, or indicate if the procedure can be undertaken at either site. Patients will be added to the waitlist within the shortest waiting time possible. Policy adherence is also more easily enforced with this model. The CWLS is located at Gungahlin Community Health Centre. It is managed by the Territory- Wide Surgical Services Team and is staffed by administrative and nursing staff. Additionally, work is underway to realign the delivery of surgical services in the territory. This will include: identifying ways to improve theatre utilisation managing the allocation of theatre sessions based on demand for particular specialty groups. Implementing this strategy will greatly assist in more timely access to surgical services in the future. Systems, technology and clinical records ACT Health now trades electronically with 22 of its major suppliers, which represents about half of spending on medical and related consumables. Electronic catalogue synchronisation has reduced the number of price and payment variations from suppliers by more than 60 per cent. Electronic trading provides early shipping status from suppliers. Supply Services (in the Business and Infrastructure Branch) uses the information to advise internal customers of when goods can be expected to be delivered, thus enhancing the customer service experience. SECTION B ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMACE19 ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMANCEThe eHealth and Clinical Records Branch has overseen improvements to a range of existing ICT , including the following: enhancing the Clinical Portal to provide greater flexibility when viewing pathology results upgrading the Cardiobase system used within the Canberra Hospital Cardiology Unit expanding the renal information system to the Tuggeranong and Belconnen Dialysis clinics. A pilot of an Electronic Medication Reconciliation solution has additionally been undertaken within the Canberra Hospital Geriatric Specialty. The BreastScreen Information System was implemented in December 2014. This purpose-built system has been designed to: streamline administrative and clinical workflows support BreastScreen management and reporting processes. An electronic task management system, known as the Medical Officer Notice board, was introduced in 2015 to assist nursing, midwifery and medical staff to manage tasks for inpatient wards. This has reduced reliance on the paging system and supports clearer, more consistent communication of tasks. An improved clinical record search and registration solution, known as Active Search, has been developed and is being progressively rolled out across ACT Health. Active Search leverages the patient master index (PMI) to provide advanced searching tools that support fast, effective patient record searches and reduce duplicate record creation rates. eHealth and Clinical Records has overseen a successful trial of a rapid access technology solution, which enables staff to log into shared computers within 4-6 seconds. This technology is available within Canberra Hospital Emergency Department and is being progressively rolled out to other clinical areas of Canberra Hospital. The Data Warehouse core framework implemented in 2013-14 uses widely available technology to integrate, manage and share information via a web portal. E-learning continued to be used to strengthen staff skills and professionalism, including for the Workplace Induction Pathway and training on writing, aseptic techniques and neonatal care. New e-learning programs were rolled out across the directorate, and others were updated. More information: For detailed information on further initiatives, see B.8 Human resources management , Learning and Development Programs , page 100.The Clinical Record Service undertook a number of back-scanning and record archiving projects to digitise or track and file a range of decentralised paper records, including a range of Respiratory and Sleep Medicine, Psychology and Pain Management records. In total, 65,000 records or 250,000 pages were scanned and a further 16,000 inactive records were tracked and filed. A team of 11 temporary staff members were employed to carry out this work. During the last six months the Clinical Coding Team has exceeded the coding Key Performance Indicator (KPI) of 90 per cent of records, averaging a 95 per cent completion rate without the assistance of external contract coders. Future directions eHealth and Clinical Records Branch is working towards implementing a range of initiatives, which support staff in delivering high-quality care to ACT Health consumers. The initiatives build on the solid e-health foundation that has been established over the past few years. The objectives that guide the initiatives include: improving availability and timeliness of information designed to support clinical decision-making at the point of care facilitating better collaboration supporting improved efficiencies across hospital and community-based health services. Reviews and Planning A significant review of the Mental Health (Treatment and Care) Act 1994 was completed during the year. As a result, an extensive amendment bill was debated and passed by the ACT Legislative Assembly on 30 October 2014. An additional Mental Health Transition and Minor Amendments Bill was tabled in the Legislative Assembly on 4 June 2015. The combined amendments from these two bills will mean that the new ACT Mental Health Act 2015 will become operational from March 2016. In 2014-15, ACT Health chaired an inter-directorate committee to lead the development of a 10-year whole-of-government Mental Health and Wellbeing (MH&W) Framework. This framework will contribute to the ACT Government's strategic priorities for improving the community's mental health and wellbeing and protecting vulnerable groups.ACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-1520The framework will explicitly address self-harm and suicide prevention. The ACT Government acknowledges that many of the social determinants affecting mental health, wellbeing and suicide prevention lie outside the health domain and, therefore, require a whole-of-government, whole- of-community approach. The framework will be developed by December 2015. A replacement for the ACT Mental Health Services Plan 2009-2014 will be developed by December 2015, in parallel to the whole-of-government MH&W framework. The replacement will be specific to ACT Health and will sit within the Health Directorate's Corporate Plan 2012-17. The plan will contribute to ACT Health's strategic priorities of continuing to meet the growth in demand for mental health services. A new Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) is planned for release in August 2015. Workforce Planning ACT Health continues to grow as an organisation that provides health services to support the growing community of the ACT . Workforce planning is essential to guide the recruitment, retention and development of a very diverse clinical and non- clinical workforce. This approach helps to ensure that the right person, with the right skills is in the right place at the right time to provide the right services within budget. Workforce planning, as a key pillar within the organisation, is needed to support the largest recurrent expense of the organisation, with approximately 80 per cent of recurrent funds being spent on workforce. The ACT Health Workforce Plan 2013-2018 identified five focus areas: Health Workforce Reform Health Workforce Development Health Workforce Leadership Health Workforce Planning Health Workforce Policy. To date, the organisation is tracking well against all focus areas. Recruitment and retention strategies are being explored and implemented to ensure that we have a workforce into the future that has the skills and capability of providing health services of the highest standard. The Australian Government funds the ACT Region Integrated Clinical Training Network (ICTN). The network is made up of the region's health and education sectors. The ICTN and its two programs\u2014 Simulated Learning Environment (SLE) and Clinical Supervision and Support Program (CSSP)\u2014 continue to be used in the region, and staff are: working towards a sustainable coordinated jurisdictional simulation learning program increasing capacity for all levels of clinical and student supervision in all health settings. More information: For detailed information about human resources activities, see B.8 Human resources management , page 97. Academic Unit of General Practice The Academic Unit of General Practice (AUGP) is co-founded by the ACT Health Directorate and the ANU Medical School. Since its establishment in 1997, the AUGP has made extensive contributions to delivering: the ANU Medical School Program medical educational programs for junior medical officers, General Practitioner (GP) vocational trainees and practicing doctors. The AUGP has developed research activities that encompass: child health integrated service development clinical research individual routes to health and healing social determinants of medical care scholarship in teaching and learning. The AUGP has led research, building from information gathered during the ACT Health Kindergarten Health Check. In addition, the AUGP has contributed to policy development within the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and wider Australian health service: through the work of the GP Advisor through the work of ICTN and Health Workforce Australia (HWA) through committee work by liaising with the ACT Medicare Local by communicating its research findings. The AUGP and academics provide clinical services to: Winnunga Nimmityjah Aboriginal Health Service Companion House Refugee health service mainstream general practice in the ACT . SECTION B ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMACE21 ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMANCESenior members of the AUGP have pivotal roles with the: Royal College of General Practitioners (RACGP) ACT Medicare Local Australian Association of Academic Primary Care Confederation of Postgraduate Medical Education Councils. Achievements During 2014-15, AUGP's achievements included the following: ANU Medical School Program Healer's Art Prevocational GP Placement Program (PGPPP) Supervisor and Registrar Teaching GP Workforce Infrastructure Program Peter Sharp Scholarship Kindergarten Health Check Research Treating Adult Obesity in General Practice Research Refugee Health Research Integration in Primary Health Care Research Vertical Integration of GP Education Research. Strategic partnerships are being developed with the Research School of Population Health at the ANU and ACT Medicare Local. Future research will build on primary healthcare health services research, with a particular focus on developing more systematic and reliable ways to articulate, measure and value the complex nature of primary care consultation. Research effort will continue in the areas of primary care in vulnerable populations, medical education and child health. Canberra Region Medical Education Council (CRMEC) The Canberra Region Medical Education Council (CRMEC) was established in December 2014 by the Minister for Health and took over the functions of the Canberra Region Prevocational Management Committee (CRPMC). The CRMEC has been accredited by the Australian Medical Council as an intern training accreditation authority for the next three years to March 2018. The CRMEC has a strong collaborative relationship with South Australian Medical Education and Training, the equivalent body in South Australia, and has strong consumer engagement and representation. The CRMEC performs accreditation functions for the intern training and education program within the ACT and region for Canberra Hospital and Health Services, Calvary Hospital, Goulburn Hospital and Bega District Hospital. Additionally, the CRMEC oversees the development and management of medical education standards, policies, processes and functions of the ACT and Region Prevocational Network. In March 2015, the CRMEC, with the assistance of the South Australian Medical Education Training Unit, facilitated training of 13 accreditation surveyors, including members from the CRMEC and the Accreditation Committee: A/Prof Katrina Anderson Dr Rob Griffin Dr Diana Tracy Ms Fiona Tito Wheatland Ms Miffany Trenery Dr David Banfield Dr Estella Janz-Robinson Dr Cameron Maxwell Dr Yinan Zhang Dr Helmut Yu Dr Russell Thomas Dr Suhaila Fatima Kamrani Dr Glenn Verheul. An accreditation of the Bega District Hospital was undertaken on 22 July 2015 in conjunction with Health Education and Training Institute (HETI). Future accreditation of the Calvary Hospital and Goulburn hospital intern training programs are planned to be undertaken over the next 12 months. The CRMEC is committed to identifying, evaluating, monitoring and promoting medical education and training programs for junior medical officers and their educators, in conjunction with key stakeholders. The council's goal is to continue to develop partnerships nationally and locally with other Postgraduate Medical Councils and professional networks to ensure familiarity with the work of other jurisdictions and maintain collaborative working relationships. Canberra Hospital Smoke-free Environment Implementation In 2014-15, a comprehensive smoke-free implementation plan was developed, and included: an education campaign providing an increased range of Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) for inpatients and staff removing the Designated Outdoor Smoking Areas on the campuses increasing staff training in smoking care increasing enforcement of the smoke-free environment. ACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-1522Business and Infrastructure Business and Infrastructure Branch is responsible for providing a range of infrastructure and strategic support services to all ACT Health acute and non- acute sites across the ACT . The value of assets under management was $886.129 million as at 30 June 2015, with property assets totalling 274,480 square metres. Activities span across several campuses including: the Canberra Hospital campus Calvary Hospital Community Health Centres Civic offices Curtin Holder Mitchell. More information: For detailed information about asset management, see C.4 Asset management , page 207. Achievements ACT Health Business and Infrastructure undertook a Food Service 'Meal Service Quality Improvement Project' based on feedback from patients, consumer representatives and relatives following their hospital experience. As part of the menu item review aspect of the project, Food Services coordinated input from a variety of stakeholders, to deliver a replacement menu, based on items and packaging with: ease of opening improved flavour the correct portion size improved presentation. Stakeholders included the: ACT Rheumatoid Arthritis and Sjogrens Support Group ACT Health Aged Care Unit, Nutrition department and Speech Pathology department. As a result Food Services introduced easy-opening breakfast cereal packs as part of the breakfast patient meal service and a range of easy-opening packaged items. Other initiatives undertaken included an Improving Patient Meal Consumption Project to provide greater 'access' to meals. This project included introducing coloured tray mats to communicate to clinical staff that: a patient requires full assistance with their meal (red tray mat) or a patient requires their meal to be set up for self-feeding, i.e. inserting straws and opening packaging (green tray mat). Following the trial of coloured tray mats within ward 11A, there has been a 22.9 per cent increase in lunch main meals consumed and a 19 per cent increase in the main dinner meals consumed. The tray mats have since been implemented into wards 11A, 11B, 5A and 5B. Issues and challenges ACT Health is one of the highest consumers of energy in the ACT Government due to the type of services delivered. Canberra Hospital delivers a critical 24-hour service to our community and is the ACT Government's largest user of energy, with 25 per cent of the territory's electricity being consumed at that site alone. As an organisation, ACT Health faces increasing environmental challenges, some of which are yet to be experienced. These challenges include increased stakeholder pressure for a robust position on sustainability. The organisation is required to achieve certain targets and meet numerous regulatory and policy measures, such as the: ACT Climate Change Strategy 2007-25 Building Code of Australia ACT Government's target of zero net emissions by 2020. Future directions ACT Health is committed to whole-of-government sustainability initiatives that work towards achieving carbon neutrality by 2060. As a part of this commitment, a feasibility study was undertaken to support an application to the Carbon Neutral Government Loan Fund. The application to the fund was for the installation of 500kW solar photovoltaic (PV) system on the roof of the southern (multi-storey) car park at Canberra Hospital. This is estimated to reduce the hospital's energy consumption by about 721,000kW each year. The project also includes the rollout of LED lighting for many of the older buildings on the hospital campus. The application was submitted in May 2015. More information: For detailed information about utilities usage and sustainability initiatives, see B.9 Ecologically sustainable development , page 111.SECTION B ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMACE23 ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMANCEWorkplace safety Safety training remains a priority and continues to be provided for Health and Safety Representatives (HSRs), managers and new staff. The Work Health and Safety Managers and Investigation course assists managers to: implement relevant preventive and corrective safety controls continuously improve safety in the workplace. ACT Health received accreditation in 2015 from WorkSafe ACT as a Registered Training Organisation (RTO) to provide tailored HSR training for our staff. Population Health The Population Health Division (PHD) has primary responsibility for managing population health issues within ACT Health. The division: undertakes the core functions of prevention, assessment, policy development and assurance contributes to local and national policy, program delivery and protocols on population health issues. The PHD is headed by the Chief Health Officer, who is appointed under the Public Health Act 1997 and reports to the Director-General of ACT Health. The Chief Health Officer is also required to report biennially on the health of the ACT population on specific health-related topics, through the Chief Health Officer's Report. The Health Improvement Branch has carriage of policy and program delivery in the areas of health promotion and preventive health. Current programs include: Kids at Play Active Play Good Habits for Life Fresh Tastes Ride or Walk to School (RWTS) Active Streets. The Health Improvement Branch also collects, analyses and disseminates information on the health status and health-related behaviours of the ACT population. This information can be used to monitor, evaluate and guide health planning and policy. The Health Protection Service manages risks and implements strategies for the prevention of, and timely response to, public health incidents. This is achieved through a range of regulatory and policy activities relating to areas such as: food safety communicable disease control environmental health emergency management pharmaceutical products tobacco control analytical services. The Office of the Chief Health Officer (OCHO) is responsible for: providing public health advice\u2014both internally and externally to the division conducting high-level project and policy work on behalf of the Chief Health Officer. Key policy priority areas for the OCHO include: obesity and injury prevention and reduction medicinal cannabis loose-fill asbestos organ and tissue donation gene technology the health effects of climate change. Achievements In February 2015, a team of 11 public health officers conducted food inspections during the three- day National Multicultural Festival, as part of a strategy to minimise public health risk from serious breaches of the Food Act 2001 . Public health officers routinely look for issues that would give rise to unacceptable food safety risks including: inadequate temperature control poor hand washing facilities inappropriate food storage. Over 290 inspections were conducted during the event. A number of food safety breaches were identified, resulting in five incidents of voluntary disposal of food. The Good Habits for Life Program is a locally- developed behaviour change campaign, which targets families with young children, and encourages physical activity and healthy eating. Good Habits for Life was launched on 11 November 2014. Phase 2 was rolled out in May and June 2015 using innovative social media streams. The campaign website has received over 30,000 visits since its launch. ACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-1524On 7 April 2015, ACT Health announced an Antenatal Pertussis Vaccination Program. Vaccinating pregnant women in the third trimester has been shown to be effective in preventing pertussis disease in newborn infants because protection is transferred from the mother to the unborn child. The ACT Government is funding the vaccine, which is to be administered at 28 weeks gestation or as soon as possible afterwards. The vaccine is available at general practices and hospital maternity units. The ACT continued to achieve high childhood immunisation coverage in the general population. Coverage rates for children in all cohorts were consistently above the national average. In 2014-15, ACT childhood immunisation coverage rates remained above 90 per cent for 12-month- old children. ACT Health's target of 92 per cent of one-year-old children being fully immunised was exceeded in all quarters (92.5 per cent, 93.1 per cent, 92.9 per cent and 92.9 per cent). On 17 November 2014, the ACT Health Air Quality Monitoring website, which included an Air Quality Index (AQI) value to indicate the cleanliness of ACT air, was launched at the Health Protection Service. The AQI provides a number that allows easy comparison of different pollutants, locations and time periods. The website provides real-time air quality data from the three air quality monitoring stations operated by ACT Health. Outlook for 2015-2016 The cessation of the National Partnership Agreement on Population Health (NPAPH) in the 2014-15 Federal Budget created significant funding shortfalls for health improvement services and programs. However, the ACT Government continued to support the majority of NPAPH-related programs for 2014-15 and provided additional support in the 2015-16 budget through its Healthier Lifestyles initiative. PHD continues to progress work on improving controlled medicines regulation in the ACT . Consultation was undertaken in 2013 on a proposed model to remove the current Chief Health Officer approval requirement for prescribing controlled medicines. This was to be coupled with improved prescription monitoring by PHD using pharmacy data. While the majority of stakeholders supported the proposal, some stakeholders have raised concerns that removing the current safeguards will put patients at risk. PHD is currently considering an alternative model to retain the approvals system for consideration by the Minister in 2015-16.Health Improvement Branch will lead implementation of the Healthier Lifestyles initiative, focusing on: delivering health promotion services for children in schools reducing smoking in pregnancy continuing implementation of Good Habits for Life. The Health Improvement Branch (HPI) is developing a new web platform to report on national and local health indicators and other population health priorities. The project aims to increase the availability of population health information for use in health policy and planning, research and by other stakeholders. PHD will continue to progress work to address the potential public health issues associated with the sale and use of electronic cigarettes. Health Planning and Infrastructure Overview Health Planning and Infrastructure (HPI) has corporate responsibility for: leading and facilitating the development of whole-of-government plans (as they relate to the Health Directorate and health services), the Health Directorate Corporate Plan, territory- wide strategic plans and clinical service plans that have a territory-wide impact directing and managing the directorate's Health Infrastructure Program (HIP), including health planning, coordination, management and implementation strategic accommodation the Capital Upgrades Program (CUP) the Arts in Health Program. Achievements Implementing the HIP was a strategic priority for 2014-15. More information: For detailed information about the HIP , see B.1 Organisational overview , 2014-15 strategic priorities , Implementing the Health Infrastructure Program , page 31. Following a review of the governance of the HIP undertaken in 2013-14, a revised HPI Group organisation structure was implemented in September 2014. This structure delineates roles and functions within Health Planning and Infrastructure and the HIP . SECTION B ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMACE25 ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMANCEDuring 2014-15, HPI aligned planning activity for: the Corporate Plan 2012-2017 the ACT Health Business Plan 2014-15 the draft ACT and Southern NSW Local Health District Cancer Services Plan 2015-2020 the ACT Lymphoedema Services Background Paper and Implementation Plan 2015-2018 associated Lymphoedema Services Plan 2015-2018 capital and facility planning in support of the HIP . A review of the Calvary Master Plan Stage 1 commenced in March 2015, and was completed on 30 June 2015 for consideration by ACT Health, the Little Company of Mary and the ACT Government. The Calvary Master Plan review will inform decisions about the future development of the Calvary Public Hospital campus. If the ACT Government agrees to progress to undertaking a full Master Plan study for the Calvary Public Hospital, Calvary staff and consumers will be involved in providing input to the process. Projects delivered by HPI as part of the HIP in 2014-15 included: the Canberra Region Cancer Centre (CRCC) refurbishing Building 1 Level 5, Canberra Hospital providing 15 additional beds at Calvary Hospital upgrading external signage at Canberra Hospital. The CRCC was a strategic priority for 2014-15. More information: For detailed information about the CRCC, see B.1 Organisational overview , 2014-15 strategic priorities , Canberra Region Cancer Centre , page 31. The Arts in Health Program includes developing and implementing briefs for art in new HIP projects. In 2014-15, this included procuring works for the: CRCC Centenary Hospital for Women and Children (CHWC) Isolation Ward, Intensive Care Unit Belconnen Community Health Centre (BCHC). Planning is underway to procure art works for the Secure Mental Health Unit (SMHU) and the University of Canberra Public Hospital (UCPH). The Arts in Health Program is supported by the Canberra Hospital Foundation.Outlook for 2015-16 During 2015-16, the following plans are programmed to be released and implemented: the ACT and Southern NSW Local Health District Cancer Services Plan 2015-2020 the ACT Lymphoedema Services Background Paper and Implementation Plan 2015-2018, and the associated Lymphoedema Services Plan 2015-2018. A number of specialty-level clinical services plans are scheduled to be completed/reviewed in 2015-16, in collaboration with clinical networks, staff and consumers. These include: reviewing the Ambulatory Care Framework, Critical Care Plan and Mental Health Services Plan developing new plans for Child Health Services, Chronic Conditions, Cardiology and Surgical Services developing an ACT Child and Youth Health Services Plan that is supported by the National Child and Youth Health Strategic Framework, which is due for finalisation in 2015. The Canberra Hospital Master Plan Study is scheduled to be completed in early 2016. The Canberra Hospital Master Plan Study will guide future planning and inform long-term investment in health infrastructure development on the Canberra Hospital campus. Corporate and Operations Plans ACT Health's efforts over the reporting year have been guided by: frameworks and strategies a range of whole-of-government strategic documents, including the Canberra Social Plan and the ACT Children's Plan. This section discusses the ACT Health-specific frameworks and strategies. ACT Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Workforce Action Plan 2013-2018 The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Workforce Action Plan 2013-2018 seeks to increase the number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people employed in the health workforce. Employing, recruiting and retaining Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the health workforce strengthens our ability to provide an effective, responsive and culturally safe health system, which is of mutual benefit to the community and our organisation.ACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-1526ACT Health Workforce Plan 2013-2018 The ACT Health Workforce Plan 2013-2018 aligns with national health workforce reform, including the research and evidence provided by the Health Workforce Australia (HWA) National Health Workforce Innovation and Reform Strategic Framework for Action 2011-2015. The plan provides strategies under focus areas for direction, action, accountabilities and measures of success, which are able to be applied for operational workforce planning in all areas of ACT Health. ACT Alcohol, Tobacco and Other Drug Strategy 2010-2014 The ACT Alcohol, Tobacco and Other Drug Strategy 2010-2014 aims to: improve the health and social wellbeing of individuals, consumers, families and carers, and the community in the ACT minimise the harm in our community from alcohol, tobacco and other drugs while recognising the individual needs of all citizens in the ACT develop evidence-informed policies and initiatives to ensure that issues associated with harmful alcohol, tobacco and other drug use are addressed in an effective way implement the Strategy Action Plan in a manner that respects, protects and promotes human rights. In 2014, the Minister for Health approved the commencement of work on the ACT Alcohol, Tobacco and Other Drug Strategy 2015-2019. ACT Breastfeeding Strategic Framework 2010-2015 The ACT Breastfeeding Strategic Framework 2010-2015 sets the context for protecting, promoting and supporting breastfeeding in the ACT . The framework is consistent with, and supports the implementation of, the action areas in the Australian National Breastfeeding Strategy 2010-2015. ACT Chronic Conditions Strategy 2013-2018 The ACT Chronic Conditions Strategy 2013-2018 provides overarching direction for chronic condition care and support in the ACT and outlines the requirement for a coordinated approach across the government and non-government sector.

The centre is designed to improve the integration and standard of care to people with cancer in the ACT and surrounding region by: being patient-centred bring together services and supports within a cohesive environment. The new facility provides capacity for additional outpatient cancer services with increases in resources for: medical oncology haematology immunology. Multidisciplinary clinics are also being provided. The following clinics have been established within the CRCC: A Shared Care Model of Care for Early Breast Cancer, which provides a new nurse-led clinic and preparation of End of Treatment Summaries to assist in follow-up care. A Melanoma Clinic to assist in the multidisciplinary care of patients with this condition. This is especially important because many new treatment options, including immune therapies and targeted agents, are now available. A Palliative Care Outpatient Clinic, which is run by the Nurse Practitioner. This clinic has assisted in timely care and support for patients of the service. A Volunteer Program was also established for the CRCC to extend engagement and support people accessing the centre and cancer wards. Volunteers are engaged to: assist with patient comfort measures provide support and company assist with way finding.ACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-1532With the move into the CRCC, implementing a Rapid Assessment Clinic has been further developed in a dedicated area on level 4 of the building. This enables patients who are having current treatment or within three months of completing treatment to be reviewed, assessed and if required treated by an oncology nurse and doctor. An initial review of the Rapid Assessment Clinic model has found that total time for review, rate of hospital admission and length of stay after admission were significantly shorter than when patients were required to present to the Emergency Department. The Rapid Assessment Clinic has been complemented by the availability of a 24-hour dedicated Telephone Triage number for current and recent patients of the CRCC. Walk-in Centres The Walk-in Centre (WiC) is designed to help people get free, one-off treatment for minor illnesses and injuries. Presenting patients are able to see a specialist nurse for advice, assessment and treatment for conditions such as: cuts and bruises minor infections strains sprains skin complaints coughs and colds. Australia's first public, nurse-led WiC was opened in May 2010 on the Canberra Hospital campus. From its opening in May 2010, until it relocated on 25 June 2014, 73,392 clients presented to the WiC, as shown in Figure 7 (page 33). The WiC relocated to two sites during 2014: the Tuggeranong WiC opened on 26 June 2014 the Belconnen WiC opened on 1 July 2014. The WiCs continue to provide free access to health advice and treatment for minor injury and illness on a one-off basis. As shown in Figure 8 (page 33), in 2014-15, the Tuggeranong WiC had 18,669 presentations and Belconnen recorded 14,311 people presenting for treatment. In 2014-15, the combined total presentations to the two WiCs increased by 47 per cent, when compared to the 2013-14 presentations to Canberra Hospital WiC.Figure 9 (page 33) shows the top 10 presenting conditions for treatment. The top 10 conditions treated have not changed significantly since last year. The common cold remains the main reason for presentations at the WiCs. As shown in Table 2 , in 2014-15, the median wait time to treatment in the WiCs was 13 minutes, where: Belconnen reported a median wait time of seven minutes Tuggeranong reported a median wait time of 19 minutes.

The Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care has awarded ACT Health full accreditation for the next three years. Significant changes to the National Safety and Quality Health Service Standards in the next accreditation cycle will require ACT Health to review its current accreditation processes to meet the requirements of the revised standards. ACT Pathology undergoes accreditation inspections by the National Association of Testing Authorities (NATA) and Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia (RCPA). The latest accreditation reassessment occurred in February and March 2015. This involved five NATA staffers and 16 technical assessors consisting of scientist and pathology specialists from other institutions. The result of this reassessment was the renewed accreditation of all of ACT Pathology laboratories.The current three-year accreditation process will change to a four-year cycle with: a surveillance mid-term reassessment conducted during the second year (2017) online assessments conducted during the first and third years (2016 and 2018). ACT Pathology also supports Canberra Hospital in their Australian Council on Healthcare Standards (ACHS) accreditation to the National Safety and Quality Health Service Standards. In 2014, Rehabilitation, Aged and Community Care's (RACC's) Geriatric Medicine Training programme was successfully accredited for a period of five years, until 2019. ACT Health is accredited with the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RANZCOG) for the provision of for obstetrics and gynaecology training until October 2015.

As shown in Figure 10 , in 2014-15, ACT public hospitals performed 11,875 elective surgery procedures, a 1 per cent increase on the 11,780 reported for 2013-14. The result for 2014-15 is the highest number of elective surgeries performed within a single year. Figure 10: Number of elective surgeries performed This is the fifth consecutive year that ACT Health has performed over 11,000 elective surgery procedures. Since 2002-03, when ACT Health provided a total of 7,661 elective surgery operations, there has been a 55 per cent increase in elective surgery activity, despite a 17 per cent increase in population since 2000-01.As shown in Figure 11 , ACT public hospitals recorded an increase in the number of patients waiting longer than the recommended timeframes for elective surgery in 2014-15, with 1,355 patients on the list at the end of June. ACT Public Hospitals Number of patients waiting longer than recommend timeframes Source: ACT Health Elective Surgery Waiting List Published longer than recommended timeframes for elective surgeryACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-1538Despite the increases, ACT Health has still reduced the number of overdue patients over the last few years. When comparing the 1,355 patients waiting longer than the recommended timeframes at the end of June 2015 with the 2,220 patients waiting in June 2010, there has been a 39 per cent decrease in long wait patients. Initiatives have been implemented to address the increase in long wait patients, including: transferring some patients to the private sector, with no additional cost to the patient increasing some surgery in public hospitals, for example, ear nose and throat surgery improving partnerships with Southern NSW. ACT Health is undertaking an in-depth analysis of elective surgery in the territory, with a focus on improving theatre utilisation and session allocation to more accurately reflect demand for specific specialty groups. We have built simulation models that predict the effect of changes to managing elective surgery. These findings will assist ACT Health in developing a surgical re-alignment strategy. As shown in Figure 12 , the median waiting time for access to elective surgery continues to improve, with a result of 45 days recorded for 2014-15, a decrease from 77 days four years ago. The ACT Health's result of 45 days is still above the 2013-14 national average of 36 days. This demonstrates the improvement that ACT Health has made over recent years. ACT Health has reduced its long waiting patients over the last few years, which has reduced the median wait time to the lowest since 2002-03. Hospital-Initiated Postponements (HIPs) measures how many patients have their elective surgery postponed. This performance indicator is useful for measuring the efficiency and effectiveness of the ACT's elective surgery management. The most common reason for postponements occurring is lower acuity patients being substituted because another higher acuity patient is given priority. ACT Health aims to ensure that less than 8 per cent of patients' elective surgery is postponed. As shown in Figure 13 , in 2014-15, ACT public hospitals achieved a result of 7 per cent, which compares favourably to the 9 per cent reported for 2010-11.ACT Public Hospitals Median wait time to surgery in days Source: ACT Health Elective Surgery Waiting List Published Dataset 77 64 51 48 45 2010-11 2011-12 2012-13 2013-14 2014-15 Figure 12: Median wait time for elective surgery in daysSECTION B ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMACE39 ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMANCEThe ACT Health 2014-15 Annual Report presents some national elective surgery figures sourced from the National Hospital Performance Authority (NHPA). This information is reported by hospital peer group, which categories similar sized hospitals. Table 5 shows comparisons between ACT public hospitals elective surgery timeliness by urgency category compared with other peer hospital groups.It is widely recognised that there is inconsistency among jurisdictions within Australia in relation to the classifications of particular procedures and what urgency categories they should be. National agencies along with jurisdictions are working to better align with a national standard for categorisation of particular procedures, but until this work has been finalised caution should be exercised when considering comparability of these results.ACT Public Hospitals Hospital-initiated postponement rate Source: ACT Health Elective Surgery Waiting List 13: Hospital-Initiated Postponement rate Table 5: Proportion of patients admitted within their recommended timeframes for their awaited procedure (major metropolitan hospitals peer group) Fin year Canberra Hospital Calvary Public Hospital Peer group average Urgency Category One (within 30 days)Urgency Category Two (within 90 days)Urgency Category Three (within 365 days)Urgency Category One (within 30 days)Urgency Category Two (within 90 days)Urgency Category Three (within 365 days)Urgency Category One (within 30 days)Urgency Category Two (within 90 days)Urgency Category Three Health Elective Surgery Waiting List Published Dataset and National Hospital Performance Authority (My Hospitals)ACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-1540Strategic Objective 2: No Waiting for Access to Emergency Dental Health Services This provides an indication of the responsiveness of the dental service to emergency clients.

Radiation Oncology is committed to commencing treatment for radiation therapy patients within the waiting time guidelines specified in Radiation Oncology Practice Standards. In 2014-15, the department achieved the following: Against a target of 90 per cent, 95 per cent of palliative patients received radiation therapy treatment within two weeks. Against a target of 90 per cent, 99 per cent of radical patients received radiation therapy treatment within four weeks. In 2014-15, 95 per cent of all radiotherapy patients were seen within standard waiting timeframes. Table 6 provides comparative figures since 2011-12.

A total of 15,566 breast screens were performed for ACT residents in 2014-15, compared with the 16,407 screening procedures reported for the same period in 2013-14. The participation rate for women aged 50-69 years was 55 per cent. BreastScreen ACT achieved the target for the total number of screens and exceeded the participation target for women aged 70-74 years. To improve numbers, BreastScreen ACT has commenced an active recruitment campaign using multiple strategies, such as contacting lapsed attendees and sending letters to GPs to encourage women to have a breast screen.

Strategic Objective 6: Reducing the Usage of Seclusion in Mental Health Episodes This measures the effectiveness of public mental health services in the ACT over time in providing services that minimise the need for seclusion. Strategic Indicator 6: The proportion of mental health clients who are subject to a seclusion episode while being an admitted patient in an ACT public mental health inpatient unit 2014-15 target2014-15 result The proportion of mental health clients who are subject to a seclusion episode while being an admitted patient in an ACT public mental health inpatient unit<3% 5% Source: ACT Health Mental Health published data (MHAGIC) - July 2015 Mental Health, Justice Health, Alcohol and Drug Services is a national leader in reducing seclusion and restraint rates in mental health inpatient settings. During the 2015 National Seclusion and Restraint Forum the national rates of seclusion were a focus. Nationally, the highest rates of seclusion occur in adult mental health units. As shown in Table 7 , in 2014-15, the ACT seclusion result was 2 per cent above our local target of 3 per cent and an increase when compared to previous year's results. Table 7: Change in seclusion results ACT public hospitals - Mental Health Seclusion Rates 2012-13 2013-14 2014-15 2% 2% 5% Source: ACT Health Admitted Patient Care Published Dataset and MHAGIC Database Reducing seclusion remains a high priority for the staff in the Adult Mental Health Unit. The higher rate of seclusion during 2014-15 was due to a very high level of clinical acuity in the Adult Mental Health Unit at Canberra Hospital in December 2014 and January 2015. The weekly seclusion review meetings continue to occur. Implementing the Aggression and Violence clinical guidelines will provide further support to staff in the early identification and management of aggression and violence. A new training program for the Early Support and Intervention Team in the Adult Mental Health Unit (AMHU) with updated procedures and protocols will contribute to reducing episodes of seclusion. Based on a former counting methodology, the target for the percentage of inpatients contacted within seven days post-discharge indicator was increased from 75 per cent in 2013-14 to 85 per cent in 2014-15. The ACT's result for this indicator in 2014-15 was 72 per cent. The most recent national publication released by the Productivity Commission is the Report on Government Services (RoGS) 2015, which examines each jurisdiction's post-discharge follow-up performance for 2012-13. As shown in Figure 14 , the national rate is 61 per cent. While the ACT's result of 72 per cent is below the target, it is the highest rate of patient follow-up seven days post-discharge in Australia.ACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-1542Figure 14: Mental health seven days post-discharge follow-up rates for 2012-13 by jurisdictionMental Health 7 days post-discharge follow up rates by jurisdiction 2012-13 Source: NT Aust The unplanned re-admission rate for 2014-15 has improved to 6 per cent when compared to 2013-14. It is known that community follow-up by mental health services, carer involvement and other community supports are key factors in reducing re-admissions within 28 days of an initial inpatient admission.

This consisted of: 53,457 same day patients 47,329 overnight patients who stayed one or more nights in hospital. Overall, the number of separations increased by 4 per cent when compared with 96,969 separations reported for 2013-14.ACT public hospitals provided 290,621 overnight hospital bed days of care in 2014-15, which is: a 3 per cent increase on the reported 2013-14 result of 280,939 a 17 per cent increase on the reported 2009-10 result of 249,046.

Premature deaths (those of people aged under 75 years) from leading potentially preventable chronic diseases have decreased over time. In 2007, a person was 17 per cent less like to die prematurely from a chronic disease than in 1997. Life expectancy at birth provides an indication of the general health of the population and reflects on a range of issues other than the provision of health services, such as economic and environmental factors. The ACT continues to enjoy the highest life expectancy of any jurisdiction in Australia and the Government aims to maintain this result.

The ACT remains the jurisdiction with the highest life expectancy in Australia. Over the 10 year period from 2004 to 2013, life expectancy in the ACT increased by two years for males and 1.1 years for females. Cancer and cardiovascular disease are the leading contributors to the total burden of disease in the ACT , contributing nearly half of the total disease burden. Strategic Objective 10: Lower Prevalence of Circulatory Disease than the National Average Population projections suggest that the ACT population is ageing faster than other jurisdictions, however the population is still younger than the national average, having a median age of 34.9 years in 2014 compared with 37.3 years. While people of all ages can present with a chronic disease, the ageing of the population and longer life spans mean that chronic diseases will place major demands on the health system for workforce and financial resources.

Strategic Objective 11: Lower Prevalence of Diabetes than the National Average This indicator provides a marker of the success of prevention and early intervention initiatives. The self-reported prevalence of diabetes in Australia has more than doubled over the past 25 years. A number of factors may have contributed to this, such as changed criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes, increased public awareness and an increase in the prevalence of risk factors such as obesity and sedentary behaviour. Prevalence rates may also increase in the short-term as a result of early intervention and detection campaigns. This would be a positive result as undiagnosed diabetes can have significant impacts on long-term health. The prevalence of diabetes in the ACT is similar to the national rate.

The ACT's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population has a lower rate of immunisation than the general population at 24-27 months. The rates of immunisation coverage for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children at 12-15 months is equal to the general population and higher than the general population for children at 60-63 months. The ACT aims to increase immunisation coverage rates for all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children through a targeted immunisation strategy.

However, the very low numbers of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in the ACT means that ACT Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander coverage data should be read with caution, as the immunisation coverage rates can fluctuate greatly. Coverage rates can vary dramatically between cohorts and between reporting periods.

SECTION B ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMACE47 ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMANCEACT Local Hospital Network strategic objectives and indicators Strategic Objectives and Indicators The ACT Local Hospital Network (ACT LHN) consists of a networked system that includes the Canberra Hospital and Health Services, Calvary Public Hospital, Clare Holland House and Queen Elizabeth II Family Centre. The ACT LHN has a yearly Service Level Agreement (SLA) which sets out the delivery of public hospital services and is agreed between the ACT Minister for Health and the Director General of the ACT LHN. This SLA identifies the funding and activity to be delivered by the ACT LHN and key performance priority targets. The ACT Government manages system-wide public hospital service delivery, planning and performance, including the purchasing of public hospital services and capital planning, and is responsible for the management of the ACT LHN. The following strategic indicators include some of the major performance indicators implemented under the requirements of the National Health Reform Agreement.

This was evident for Emergency Department timeliness, where ACT public hospitals recorded results below last year's overall timeliness figures. Emergency Department timeliness measures how long patients wait to receive their care. In 2014-15, ACT public hospital Emergency Departments reported an overall timeliness result of 59 per cent, 2 per cent below the result reported in 2013-14. Table 11 shows the percentage of patients seen on time by triage category in 2014-15. The 3 per cent increase in presentations experienced in 2014-15 affected on the ability to treat all patients within recommended timeframes. This led to longer waiting times for some lower acuity patients. The ACT met the target for triage category one and category two.

When simply comparing presentations, from 2012-13 to 2013-14, there was a 6 per cent increase in people seeking treatment in 12 months. This equates to an average of 345 people attending the public hospital Emergency Departments each day.Table 12 provides a further breakdown of national comparative figures for the major metropolitan hospital peer group over recent financial years for percentage of presentations seen on time.

Figure 16: Did Not Wait for treatment ratesACT Public Hospitals Did Not Wait Rate Source: ACT Health Emergency Department 2014-1550Strategic Objective 3: Maximising the Quality of Hospital Services The following four indicators are a selection of the patient safety and service quality indicators that are used to monitor ACT public hospital services. The targets provide an indication of the desired outcomes over time. Given the nature of the indicators, small fluctuations during a particular period can skew results. The success in meeting these indicators requires a consideration of performance over time rather than for any given period. This indicator represents the quality of theatre and postoperative care.

Also as shown in Figure 17 , preliminary figures suggest Canberra Hospital reported an increase in 2014-15 when compared to previous years. However, this result is below the target, which is set at 1 per cent. Canberra Hospital is a major teaching and referral hospital that manages more complex patients and higher levels of complications.

It now measures the number of people admitted to hospitals per 10,000 occupied bed days who acquire a SAB infection during their hospital stay.ACT Health infection control officers continue to develop and implement programs and processes to limit the transfer of infections within public hospitals. This includes providing communication and education programs for clinicians, patients, general staff and visitors. In addition, both ACT public hospitals maintain processes to minimise hospital-acquired infections during hospital stays. As noted previously, the targets for each hospital are based on the types of services provided. As the major trauma hospital for the region, Canberra Hospital has higher SAB infection rates than Calvary Public Hospital. As shown in Table 16 , Canberra Hospital reported a positive SAB rate result of 1.00 cases per 10,000 bed days in 2014-15, which is an improvement on the 1.05 cases reported for 2013-14.

Furthermore, recent national figures illustrated in Table 16 and Table 17 show both public hospitals remain below the national average for their respective hospital categories or peer groups. On 9 April 2015, the National Health Performance Authority (NHPA) released its latest report titled Healthcare-associated Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infection in 2013-14.The report highlighted that in 2013-14, major peer group hospitals with more vulnerable patients had an average result of 1.28 cases per 10,000 patient bed days. For that same period, Canberra Hospital reported a result of 1.05 cases per 10,000 patient bed days, which is: below the peer group average a decrease compared to the result reported for 2012-13 of 1.55 cases per 10,000 patient days. Strategic Indicator 3.4 Strategic Indicator 3.4: The Estimated Hand Hygiene Rate The estimated hand hygiene rate for a hospital is a measure of how often (as a percentage) hand hygiene is correctly performed. It is calculated by dividing the number of observed hand hygiene 'moments' where proper hand hygiene was practiced in a specified audit period, by the total number of observed hand hygiene 'moments' in the same audit period. 2014-15 target2014-15 result 70% 79% Calvary Public Hospital 70% 77% Source: Hand Hygiene Australia online database As shown in Table 18 , Canberra and Calvary public hospitals continued to improve on the national benchmark of 70 per cent during the most recent audit, which was undertaken in March 2015.

The key strategic priority for acute services is to deliver timely access to effective and safe hospital care services. This means focusing on: strategies to meet performance targets for the Emergency Department, elective and emergency surgery continuing to increase the capacity of acute care services. Overview Acute services are provided by: the Division of Critical Care the Division of Medicine the Division of Pathology the Division of Surgery, Oral Health and Medical Imaging the Division of Women, Youth and Children. Division of Critical Care The Division of Critical Care is responsible for delivering acute and critical care and providing retrieval services. These are provided as inpatient and outpatient services at Canberra Hospital, with a strong emphasis on accessible and timely care, delivered to a high standard of safety and quality. This is underpinned by the division's commitment to research and training. The division includes the: Retrieval Service (both road and air) Emergency Department Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Access Unit Surgical Short Stay Unit Acute Surgical Unit (ASU) Discharge Lounge and Medi-Hotel Medical Assessment and Planning Unit (MAPU). Division of Medicine The Division of Medicine provides adult medicine services to the Canberra community in inpatient, outpatient and outreach settings. An emphasis is placed on accessible, timely and integrated care, which is delivered to a high standard of safety and quality.The Division of Medicine comprises: Renal Services Cardiology Academic Unit of Internal Medicine Sexual Health Centre Neurology Gastroenterology and Hepatology Dermatology Diabetes Service Endocrinology Forensic and Medical Sexual Assault Services Infectious Diseases Inpatient Ward Services, Ambulatory Clinics and Clinical Measurement Services across many specialties Pharmacy Services Respiratory and Sleep Services Rheumatology. The division has a strong commitment to teaching and research. Health students from several universities undertake practical placements within the division. Most of the division's senior medical staff holds academic appointments at the ANU Medical School, and many research programs are in operation. Many members of the division's staff participate in developing national professional guidelines and quality initiatives. Division of Pathology Pathology is a medical specialty that examines disease processes and their cause. Services are provided in the acute setting at Canberra Hospital, Calvary Hospital, the National Capital Private Hospital and in the community through collection centres across the ACT . A home collection service for patients who are frail or unwell and who cannot attend these collection centres is also provided. Pathology is a demand-driven service that plays a critical role in more than 70 per cent of clinical diagnoses and many of the decisions around optimal treatment for patients. Due to the critical role of pathology testing in diagnosis and treatment, the objective and direction for pathology are intimately tied to the objectives and priorities of ACT Health's Corporate Plan. Pathology works in close collaboration with many areas of the Health Directorate to provide access to accurate, timely results to assist in diagnosing, managing and monitoring patients. ACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-1554In line with Health Directorate objectives, Pathology supports Canberra Hospital, Calvary Hospital and the community in numerous ways, including: infection control public health outbreaks (Norovirus, Measles, Flu, Tuberculosis, Meningococcal, etc.) Emergency Department. Pathology also performs testing for the ACT Breast Screening and Cervical Screening programs. Division of Surgery, Oral Health and Medical Imaging The Division of Surgery, Oral Health and Medical Imaging is responsible for delivering: inpatient and outpatient surgical and medical imaging services prevention and treatment dental health programs for children, targeted youth and adults of the ACT and surrounding region. The division includes: Surgical Bookings and Pre-Admission Clinic Anaesthesia Pain Management Unit Operating Theatres Post-Anaesthetic Care Unit Day Surgery Unit and Admissions / Extended Day Surgery Unit Medical Imaging specialist surgical ward areas medical and nursing outpatient services Shock Trauma Service Trauma and Orthopaedic Research Unit the ACT Dental Health Program. Division of Women, Youth and Children The Division of Women, Youth and Children provides a broad range of primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare services. The provision of services is based on a family-centred, multidisciplinary approach to care in partnership with the consumer and other service providers. Services are provided: at Canberra Hospital in community health centres and in community-based settings, including clients' homes, schools, and child and family centres. Some services are provided within other agency facilities. The Division of Women, Youth and Children comprises: maternity services, including the: Continuity at the Canberra Hospital (CatCH) Program Canberra Midwifery Program (CMP) Maternity Assessment Unit (MAU) Early Pregnancy Assessment Unit (EPAU) Fetal Medicine Unit (FMU) women's health, including: health screening gynaecology programs targeting violence against women the Women's Health Service, which prioritises women who experience barriers to accessing mainstream services neonatology, including: the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) the Special Care Nursery (SCN) specialist clinics newborn hearing screening the ACT Newborn Retrieval Service paediatrics, including: inpatient care specialist clinics community paediatricians a genetics service the Maternal and Child Health (MACH) nursing service, including: a universal home visit following birth breastfeeding and parenting support immunisation and referral services that support children and their families with complex care needs, including: the MACH Parenting Enhancement Program the Asthma Nurse Educator Service the Caring for Kids Program, which supports care in the home for children with complex needs the Child at Risk Health Unit, which supports care for children affected by violence and abuse Integrated Multi-agencies for Parents and Children Together Program, which coordinates care for woman with complex care needs who are pregnant and/or have young children child protection training for clinicians the Healthcare Access At Schools (HAAS) Program school-based nursing services, including immunisation, kindergarten health checks, school youth health checks and the HAAS Program nurse audiometry, which provides hearing assessments to children and adults.SECTION B ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMACE55 ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMANCEPerformance against accountability indicators The Dental Health Program has continued to achieve the mean waiting time target for clients on the dental services waiting list. This is now set at six months, which is a reduction of six months when compared to previous years. The Dental Health Program has improved on the target with clients on the waiting list having a year-to-date (YTD) mean waiting time of 4.15 months at the end of June 2015. In June 2014, the YTD mean waiting time was reported at 5.01 months and in June 2013 YTD, it was 11 months. The National Partnership Agreement for dental Adult Waiting List Times has been extended by the Commonwealth until 30 June 2016. This initiative has enabled the ACT Restorative Waiting list to be reduced and achieve a lower than six month mean waiting time. The KPI to meet is set at six months. At the end of this initiative the ACT waiting time will need to be reviewed. More information: For additional information, see C.6 Statement of performance , Output 1.1: Acute Services , page 223. Emergency Department The Emergency Department continues to face challenges associated with an increase in patients presenting for treatment in comparison to the 2013-14 financial year. Similarly, the ICU faces challenges with an increase in: patients requiring admission the acuity of patients requiring admission. The increasing number of presentations to the Emergency Department will continue to impact on the demand in the Emergency Department. However, there is a whole-of-hospital focus on initiatives to enhance access to care at Canberra Hospital. Emergency surgery Canberra Hospital is the major tertiary and trauma referral centre for the ACT and surrounding NSW. This means that it needs to be equipped and able to manage high volumes of trauma and emergency cases that cannot be provided by other facilities. The increasing demand for elective and emergency surgical procedures has continued into the 2014-15 period. ACT Health continues to change where and how surgery is delivered in the ACT , to ensure that patients are receiving their surgery in the right facility at the right time.Elective surgery From 2009-10 to 2013-14, ACT public hospitals made significant improvements in how quickly patients access their elective surgery and within the clinically recommended timeframes. These improvements have continued into 2014-15. On 20 October 2014, the AIHW released their latest report on elective surgery waiting times performance over 2013-14. While the ACT's result of 48 days for 2013-14 is still above the national average of 36 days, in 2009-10, the ACT reported a median wait time to surgery of 73 days, which is not the highest national median wait time. The Surgical Services Re-alignment Program is being led by the Performance Information Branch to provide short-, medium- and long-term planning for surgery across the territory and surrounding region. The main principle underpinning the re-alignment is to provide a regional approach to surgical services that achieve better patient outcomes and best utilise all available public hospital resources. Acute Care services The Acute Surgical Unit (ASU) commenced in April 2015 and is staffed and run by consultants at Canberra Hospital. The ASU admits patients who have been assessed as likely to require a surgical procedure and aims to maximise access to emergency theatre time for general surgery patients. The ASU has access to a dedicated theatre list from Monday to Friday. Following on from the ICU extension, which was completed in October 2013, an additional two ICU beds opened in 2014-15. This has provided efficiencies in bed management because it allows patients to be isolated or positioned further away from other patients, as required. The Capital Region Retrieval Service was successful in securing funding to purchase a road vehicle to improve patient care and road retrieval response times. The Capital Region Retrieval Service continues to see an increase in annual total activity (Missions and Consults) from 702 in 2013-14 to 786 in 2014-15. The ACT Government funded Canberra's first Mobile Dental Clinic, which was launched in January 2015. The purpose-built truck is improving access to dental health services for Canberrans residing in aged care facilities. In the first six months it visited seven facilities, providing a range of preventative, restorative and denture services.ACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-1556A dedicated nursing Trauma Case Management Service commenced within the Shock Trauma Service. Funding for the appointment of a Nurse Practitioner in the Shock Trauma Service has been confirmed. The goals of trauma case management (TCM) are to: provide well-coordinated care for patients and families ensure that satisfactory clinical outcomes are met. In addition, the service aims to effectively manage patient length of stay and hospital resources by improving the integration and coordination of the activities of multiple sub specialties. A new Cardiac Catheter Diagnostic Suite (CCDS) was installed in the Cardiology Department at Canberra Hospital in 2014. This has provided enhanced clinical services for our patients. The CCDS brings a new imaging performance, enabling the clinician to ultimately treat the patient faster, with more precision and with added confidence for enhanced patient outcomes. The CCDS is the first of its kind in the ACT . The high powered X-ray tube reduces the radiation dose to the patient (and operator) by up to 60 per cent when compared to conventional imaging equipment. During 2014-15, Cardiology implemented an integrated database that provides clinicians with a seamless flow of information and data across both clinical and diagnostic services. This has improved communication between Canberra Hospital and Health Services (CHHS) specialists and GPs and improved patient care. An additional two non-invasive cardiologists were appointed to support and improve echocardiography at Canberra Hospital. The appointments have significantly improved access and, as a result, there is no longer a wait time associated with the echocardiography service for inpatients. The Canberra Hospital's Coronary Care Unit (CCU) opened at Woden Valley Hospital on 16 June 1975, under the direction of Dr David Coles and RN Judy Foskett. The CCU now has: nine cardiologists 35 CCU nursing staff 24-hour medical cover. During 2014-15, it celebrated its 40th anniversary. The CCU has established and maintained a high-quality service for Canberra and the surrounding region.Following the completion of renovations to the Gastroenterology and Hepatology Unit (GEHU) in 2014 and the allocation of an additional $300,000 in enhancement funding in 2014-15, overall patient flow and capacity has increased. This has allowed an additional 300 procedures to be completed, which assisted in reducing the waiting list and improved timely access to this service in the territory. A dedicated 20-bed Gastroenterology and Hepatology Medical Inpatient Unit opened and accepted its first patients on 18 November 2014. Hospital in the Home (HITH) has increased its capacity to deliver the service by increasing the number of Registrars who visit and treat patients within their own home. In addition, through the Capital Upgrades Program (CUP), enhancement funding is being used to expand the HITH service, which will increase the physical treatment space at Canberra Hospital. This upgrade will: allow patients to receive treatment from clinicians in a safe clinical space in a timely manner support the ongoing HITH service and improve overall patient satisfaction. This work is due to be completed in September 2015. In 2014-15 and into the beginning of 2015-16, the Northside Dialysis Unit will relocate from Calvary Hospital to the Belconnen Community Health Centre (BCHC), where an expanded service will be offered. The move offers a number of advantages to clients accessing the service, including: easy access to co-located allied health services, including dieticians and podiatry longer opening hours, with plans to offer nocturnal dialysis. This will make BCHC the first public nocturnal dialysis provider in Australia. In addition, dialysis services are also now offered in the refurbished Tuggeranong Community Health Centre, which commenced treating patients on 25 May 2015 and offers 12 dialysis stations. The Division of Medicine's inpatient sleep laboratory provides opportunities to interpret complex sleep studies. Four additional clinical staff have recently been recruited. This has resulted in an increased ability to meet the demand for this service, improving access for patients and referring clinicians. Canberra Hospital, as the only Level Three Tertiary hospital for the ACT and surrounding regions, accepts patients who cannot be accepted by non-tertiary facilities due to the patient's clinical indications. The dual demands of occupancy and acuity are impacting on Canberra Hospital's ability to provide tertiary-level care to women and their babies. SECTION B ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMACE57 ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMANCEIn response to the escalating demands for maternity services at the Centenary Hospital for Women and Children (CHWC), the Canberra Hospital has been working closely with Calvary Public Hospital and Queanbeyan Hospital to determine ways of better managing maternity services across the ACT and the surrounding region. Early intervention and prevention The Shock Trauma Service received a grant from the NRMA ACT Road Safety Trust to pilot the Prevent Alcohol and Risk-Related Trauma in Youth Program (PARTY Program), in response to an increasing trend in alcohol-associated harm and hospitalisation in the ACT . The program, targeted at high school students, involves the students: hearing talks from ambulance workers and trauma surgeons participating in tours of the hospital interacting with rehabilitation equipment meeting young trauma survivors. The HAAS Program provides nurse-led care to students with additional healthcare needs while they attend ACT Government schools. The model includes a HAAS Registered Nurse (RN) who works with the family and others involved to develop a care plan for the student. The RN then trains the school Learning Support Assistant (LSA) in the specific healthcare tasks required to support that particular student. These are often the same tasks that are undertaken by family members or carers when the child is not at school. Due to some concerns from the community, ACT Health in collaboration with the Education and Training Directorate (ETD), has reviewed the needs of children in specialist schools and has undertaken a consultation process regarding HAAS and the role of nurses in specialist schools. The consultation process involved Health, ETD, teachers, unions and parents. This work will be completed by August 2015. Pathology Demand for pathology requests increased in 2014-15. Table 19 shows the number of pathology requests received, the total number of tests performed and the percentage increase.Table 19: Pathology requests 2013-14 2014-15 % 4.64% Total 5,185,660 5,250,641 1.30% Australian Council on Healthcare Standards (ACHS) Clinical Indicators demonstrate timeliness of reporting of results for selected Canberra Hospital Emergency Department tests.

We work in collaboration with the University of Canberra, ANU and CIT to continue to develop and support the various scientific and technical courses required to support medical laboratory science. ACT Pathology staff undertake continuing education by attending external conferences of national associations and industry workshops. Pathology Division is a scientific discipline with research as a cornerstone. We participate in many research projects and many of our pathologists and scientists are actively involved in their own research or work collaboratively with others. Members of the division (scientific and medical) continue to publish actively in peer-reviewed journals and participate in professional meetings and workshops both in Australia and overseas. Telemedicine services The Telemedicine network is now established across Southern NSW and the ACT and incorporates: 12 hospitals in Southern NSW the two ACT public hospitals the SouthCare rescue helicopter base at Hume.ACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-1558Health Pathways The Division of Medicine clinical units have been a major player in the rollout of Health Pathways. This was developed in collaboration with the ACT Medicare Local to articulate and publish pathways of care across the continuum, in collaboration with Canberra and regional GPs. Health Pathways has been developed to increase the quality of referrals to specialist services and improve the wait time for patients accessing specialist care. The system provides evidence-based guidelines to manage patients within primary care and triggers for specialist referral, which are promulgated by the tertiary specialist service. Health Pathways went live on 13 April 2015 and was launch by the Minister for Health, Simon Corbell Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA), on 25 May 2015. There are currently 70 live pathways, including pathways for: Diabetes Sexual Assault Early Breast Cancer Follow-up Blood borne virus exposure Deep vein thrombosis Cardiology Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. Many more pathways are currently under development, including those for mental health services and liver conditions. Awards and presentations The Family-Integrated Care Program Team from NICU/SCN won the Public Team Excellence Award for their consistent commitment to parental involvement in care. The project team is examining whether the Family-Integrated Care model improves the health and wellbeing of prematurely born babies. More information: For detailed information, see Future directions , Models of care , page 60, in this section.Future directions Emergency Department The HPI Branch commenced a $23 million project to deliver an expansion of the Emergency Department at Canberra Hospital, which includes delivering an integrated paediatric streaming function. The project incorporated a $5 million commitment from the Commonwealth. The expansion and refurbishment will improve the Emergency Department's layout, creating efficiencies that are expected to reduce waiting times. The works will include more comfortable sub waiting areas for patients waiting for treatment and a dedicated waiting and triage area for paediatric patients. Acute Care services The Medical Imaging Department will transition to the Division of Critical Care in 2015-16, to allow closer alignment between the department and other key stakeholders. During 2014-15, the Capital Region Retrieval Service faced challenges in recruiting staff to its 24-hour roster. As such, in 2015-16, it will focus on identifying innovative ways to recruit further staff. Increased admission numbers and activity levels on the paediatric ward over the winter period have created a need to develop a Paediatrics Winter Strategy. Data for this period is being collated within the division, and staffing models are being assessed for the best level of staffing to cope with the predicted increased demand. As part of the strategy, further work is also being undertaken to formalise the management of staffing allocation and patient flow across the four inpatient wards during the high activity period. The capacity to have an overflow area (Paediatric Surgical Area) for increased admission numbers during winter is one of the components in addressing staff allocation and improved patient flow for the Emergency Department. Currently, CHHS does not have clinics specifically for pulmonary hypertension or dyspnoea and has identified this as an area of need. Work has recently started in collaboration with Cardiology, Rheumatology and Respiratory and Sleep sub specialties to develop these services. Further research is being undertaken with regard to best practice and next steps.SECTION B ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMACE59 ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMANCEThe Division of Medicine has faced challenges over 2014-15 in meeting demand across all sub specialties. However, plans are in place to address this and improve access to medical services for all our patients across the territory. Over the next year, an emphasis will be placed on the care of acute medical admissions to CHHS. This will include admission models of prevention, streamlining the flow of patients to inpatient services and streamlining discharging patients to appropriate services in the community. The Internal Medicine Unit Directors meeting will facilitate collaboration across all physician-based specialties, regardless of divisional structure. The Division of Medicine will: refine the Acute General Medicine model, incorporating the Medical Assessment and Planning Unit (MAPU) continue to implement the recommendations of the CHHS Administrative Services Review, including developing a model for administrative support to the Division, with specific regard to ambulatory services progress more team-based models appropriate to care across the division facilitate more community-based services in the new community health centres in Gastroenterology, Liver and Renal Services participate in the CHHS-wide Optimising the Patient Experience project, which will see the Division of Medicine improve access to home oxygen for clinicians and their patients discharged home from an inpatient ward. Work is currently being undertaken in collaboration with all physician-based units at Canberra Hospital and acute allied health services to establish a physician-led Medical Admissions Unit. This unit will coordinate care and admission for referred patients from the Emergency Department to the most appropriate clinical team. This will create a more streamlined process from presentation to admission, and improve the clinical care provided to our patients, including reducing the length of stay. The Division of Medicine has identified areas of improvement in the care of patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) across the territory, and the transfer of these patients between Calvary Hospital and Canberra Hospital. The Division of Medicine is working with Calvary Public Hospital to ensure that improvements are aligned with the: Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care national standards clinical benchmarks indicators for these patients. In conjunction with the work being undertaken to improve care for patients with ACS, Cardiology is working to establish a specific Coronary Angiography Computed Tomography (CT) Service. This service will build on existing cardiology services, such as the Chest Pain Evaluation Unit, and will serve to identify underlying cardiac conditions. Early intervention and prevention As a result of the positive feedback of the PARTY Program, the Shock Trauma Service will seek an alternative source of funding for the program to allow it to continue and expand in 2015-16. Pathology Pathology is working collaboratively with Health IT to introduce an electronic ward ordering system that will improve completion of mandatory information required for pathology testing and legibility. This will improve the accuracy of request information and provide decision-making support information to the requesting doctor. A pilot is expected to be available early in 2016. Pathology works closely with clinicians at Canberra Hospital to ensure accurate patient identification in specimen collection for pathology testing. To support this, the electronic ward ordering system will include a positive patient identification (PPID) component, which will reduce misidentification and mislabelling of specimens. The major challenge for the Division of Pathology is facing increasing demand by clinicians and patients for more rapid, specific and high-tech testing for patient management, particularly in the molecular fields of cancer gene analysis and bacterial sequencing while maintaining a skilled workforce operating 24 hours a day. The future will see a significant increase in technology usage, including both automation and new technologies. This will require a workforce that is well informed and able to adapt to changes in laboratory practice. Telemedicine services The Telemedicine service will expand into managing moderately ill patients, with possible integration into the Canberra Hospital access unit and Emergency Department Admitting Officer roles.ACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-1560Models of care Enhancements to the Model of Care for both the Discharge Lounge and Medi-Hotel are planned. The aim is to improve access to the services and improve patient flow for patients being discharged from the hospital. ACT Health has completed the framework to introduce a model of patient care that will allow privately practising eligible midwives to admit their private patients to the CHWC for birthing services. This Model of Care will be operationalised by the Division of Women, Youth and Children. In some models of care in NICUs, parents spend significant time at the hospital with their babies and are encouraged to take on many aspects of their baby's care, once their baby is stable. This model is called 'Family-Integrated Care' . The Family-Integrated Care model has been successfully introduced to a small group of patients at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, Canada, and is now extended to more families in NICUs across Australia and New Zealand. To understand whether this Model of Care is better for parents and their babies, the NICU and SCN at Canberra Hospital are participating in an international, randomised trial. This study examines whether the Family-Integrated Care model improves the health and wellbeing of prematurely born babies. Parents and babies will be involved in this project from the time of enrolment until the babies are discharged from the hospital. Parents will be given access to small, group learning sessions and some additional support, to make it easier for them to be present in the NICU for the required length of time. The nurse-to-patient ratio will not change. It is estimated that this study will commence at the end of July 2014 and will be completed in August 2015. Health Pathways The Division of Medicine identified that patient care and patient experience could be enhanced by developing a Back Pain Pathway. Back pain is a relatively common problem in the Australian community with implications for: work productivity mental health interpersonal relationships the overall health budget. Early initial intervention using a multidisciplinary approach is effective in reducing long-term disability. The project aims to streamline the flow of patients through the Emergency Department who present with back pain, and then ensure that the patients receive the best possible care through an efficient use of CHHS resources. A working group has been established to lead this work, which will examine the inpatient and outpatient experience across all CHHS divisions and review resources within the community. The Division of Medicine will also enhance patient care by developing an Acute Stroke Pathway. It is developing, in collaboration with the ACT Ambulance Service and Calvary Public Hospital, an evidence-based, widely-endorsed pathway for caring for acute stroke patients across the territory. The pathway will aim to result in: improved timeliness to first intervention decreased mortality lower rates of disability increased adherence to evidence-based guidelines for the management of acute stroke. While caring for patients with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and Non-STEMI (NSTEMI) patients, CHHS has identified a need to improve the transfer of care pathways. CHHS is working with Southern NSW Local Health District (SNSWLHD) to improve the transfer of STEMI patients to Canberra Hospital for care. CHHS and SNSWLHD are currently working to improve communication lines between Southern NSW hospitals and Canberra Hospital and the management of patient care. A Service Innovation and Redesign Framework (SIRF) project is being undertaken to manage the demand and flow of patients within GEHU who require outpatient clinic visits and procedures. This project aims to improve flow, to create efficiencies and to improve utilisation of available resources. As part of the redesign work, the Service Lead will review endoscopy pathways with a view to streamlining, including reviewing the provision of additional anaesthetics assisted lists for high risk patients. The project is due to be completed at the end of the second quarter in 2015-16.SECTION B ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMACE61 ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMANCEOutput 1.2: Mental Health, Justice Health and Alcohol and Drug Services The Health Directorate provides a range of Mental Health, Justice Health and Alcohol and Drug Services through: the public and community sectors in hospitals community health centres and other community settings adult and youth correctional facilities people's homes across the territory. These services work to provide integrated and responsive care to a range of services, including: hospital-based specialist services therapeutic rehabilitation counselling supported accommodation services other community-based services. The key priorities for Mental Health, Justice Health and Alcohol and Drug Services are ensuring that: people's health needs are met in a timely fashion care is integrated across hospital, community, and residential support services. This means focusing on: ensuring timely access to emergency mental health care ensuring that public and community mental health services in the ACT provide people with appropriate assessment, treatment and care that result in improved mental health outcomes providing community- and hospital-based alcohol and drug services providing health assessments and care for people detained in corrective facilities.Overview Mental Health, Justice Health and Alcohol and Drug Services provide health services directly and through partnerships with community organisations. The services provided range from prevention and treatment to recovery and maintenance and harm minimisation. Consumer and carer participation is encouraged in all aspects of service planning and delivery. The division delivers services at a number of locations, including: hospital inpatient and outpatient settings community health centres detention centres other community settings, including people's homes. During 2014-15, a significant number of the recommendations from the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) Model of Care were implemented, including: establishing a Bimberi CAMHS liaison role establishing a child early intervention program addressing comorbidity through training enhanced and routine screening establishing and strengthening liaison and consultation pathways with youth alcohol and drug services providing secondary consultation. The services provided by the division include: Adult Mental Health Services Adult Mental Health Unit (AMHU) Belconnen Mental Health Team City Mental Health Team Gungahlin Mental Health Team Mental Health Assessment Unit (MHAU) Tuggeranong Mental Health Team Woden Mental Health Team ACT-Wide Mental Health Services Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Mental Health Services Adult Mental Health Day Service Brian Hennessy Rehabilitation Centre Crisis Assessment and Treatment Team Mental Health Comorbidity Clinician Mental Health Service for People with Intellectual Disabilities Mental Health Consultation Liaison\u2014the Canberra Hospital (TCH) and Calvary Hospital Mobile Intensive Treatment Team- North Neuropsychology Older Persons Mental Health TeamACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-1562Justice Health Services Forensic Mental Health Services Justice Health Primary Health Secure Mental Health Unit (in development) Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) CAMHS South CAMHS North Dialectical Behaviour Therapy Program Early Intervention Team Eating Disorders Program Perinatal Mental Health The Cottage Alcohol and Drug Program Consultation and Liaison Counselling and Treatment Services Police and Court Diversion Services Opioid Treatment Service Withdrawal Services The Mental Health, Justice Health and Alcohol and Drug Services workforce is facing a challenge associated with the increase in growth across the service. A workforce plan will oversee the development of a workforce strategy, planning and development framework. Mental Health, Justice Health and Alcohol and Drug Services commenced the preparatory phase of the Workforce Development for the Secure Mental Health Unit (SMHU). A workforce development and recruitment plan has been developed, which includes staging staff recruitment in line with the commissioning/staging of beds. Training opportunities, such as scholarships, will be offered to staff to facilitate their development in the area of Forensic Mental Health. Performance against accountability indicators Against the accountability indicators, Mental Health, Justice Health and Alcohol and Drug Services have: Exceeded the target of 109,000 occasions of service within the Adult Mental Health Services Program by 4 per cent. This achievement is in response to the demand for services and improvements in staff resourcing to meet this demand. Achieved 100 per cent against the target of 65,000 occasions of services within CAMHS. Exceeded the target of 100,000 occasions of service within the ACT-Wide Mental Health Services Program by 6 per cent. This higher than expected level of activity was predominately achieved due to the high levels of contact with the Crisis Assessment and Treatment Team. Achieved 100 per cent of all detainees admitted to the Alexander Maconochie Centre (AMC) having a completed health assessment within 24 hours of detention. Achieved 94 per cent against the target of 100 per cent of all young people admitted to Bimberi Youth Justice Centre having a completed health assessment within 24 hours of detention. This was due to four health assessments not being undertaken within the 24 hour period where: one was due to a potential security risk of the young person as advised by Bimberi management and was completed approximately 48 hours after admission three were due to health staff not being advised of the admission of the three young people, and were completed at 24.5, 27 and 27.5 hours after admission. Exceeded the target of 105,000 occasions of service within the Justice Health Services Program by 9 per cent. This can be attributed to an increased demand related to an increased muster at the AMC. Achieved the target of 98 per cent of all new clients on pharmacotherapy treatment for opioid dependency having a completed management plan. Achieved 97 per cent against the target of 70,000 occasions of services within the Alcohol and Drug Services Program.

Emergency mental health care A review of the Mental Health Assessment Unit (MHAU) Model of Care is underway. A workshop was held in April 2015 and provided an opportunity to review current governance arrangements and clinical pathways. Final sketch plans have been completed for the mental health space within the Emergency Department. The AMHU Model of Care was reviewed in the context of the Canberra Hospital Emergency Department expansion, which is due for completion in 2016. The new footprint will support both an emergency assessment and mental health short-stay functions.SECTION B ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMACE63 ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMANCEMental health services An Adult Community Mental Health Model of Care redesign project delivered a preliminary Model of Care and high-level implementation plan. It is anticipated that this redesign will support community mental healthcare that is evidence- based, contemporary and better meets the needs of the expanding Canberra community. An Adult Mental Health Rehabilitation Unit (AMHRU) and an interim Adult Mental Health Day Service (AMHDS) Model of Care were both developed and finalised as part of the overall Service Delivery Plan for the University of Canberra Public Hospital (UCPH). The purpose of a specialist AMHRU is to deliver effective recovery-based treatment and rehabilitation to people whose needs cannot be met by less intensive community-based adult mental health services. An AMHDS began operating from the BCHC in July 2014. This is an interim measure until an enhanced AMHDS is commissioned in the UCPH. The AMHDS provides treatment for adults aged 18-65 years and offers: subacute support services programs aimed at preventing an acute psychiatric admission day treatment therapies transitional support for those people exiting acute services and reintegrating back into the community intensive psychological therapy extended treatment and recovery programs. A plan was developed in August 2014, to transition the residents of the Brian Hennessy Rehabilitation Centre (BHRC). The aim is to establish individual plans for the people currently supported at BHRC to access appropriate accommodation, supports and services to enable them to successfully reside in the community in the future. Information sessions were held to inform key stakeholders, family, carers and peak bodies of the transitional arrangements and plan.Alcohol and Drug Services Alcohol and Drug Services (ADS) continue to implement the pharmacist-led Nicotine Replacement Clinic for clients of the Opioid Treatment Service and withdrawal services. Opportunistic smoking cessation interventions are provided to clients: accessing alcohol and drug services accessing the AMHU in the BHRC. ADS are part of a national research project, Tackling Nicotine Together, through Newcastle University. Justice Health Services The Model of Care for the SMHU was finalised in May 2014 and the facility design finalised in 2015. Significant work has occurred on the workforce plan for the SMHU. Forensic Mental Health Services provided training on mental health awareness and processes to the magistrates of the ACT Law Courts. It is planned that this initiative will be further expanded to other agencies, such as: the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions Magistrates Associates Legal Aid services. A streamlined induction process was established at the Bimberi Youth Justice Centre. A review of this change is ongoing and is being supported by extra staff supervision and training. Forensic Mental Health Services has also continued to provide mental health awareness and education training to Bimberi youth workers as part of their training inductions. Justice Health Services has commenced the 2015-2016 Young Persons in Custody Health Survey. The survey will run from February 2015 to February 2016. The results from 50 or more young people who participate will provide further information regarding the health, sexuality, education, employment, social circumstances, alcohol and other drugs exposure of the young people. This information will be used to inform future service provision.ACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-1564Future directions Mental Health, Justice Health and Alcohol and Drug Services will be undertaking work to boost a range of services in the areas of: emergency mental health care mental health services alcohol and drug services justice health Services. Emergency mental health care As part of redesigning the Adult Community Mental Health Model of Care, the Crisis Assessment and Treatment Team will be expanded. This will provide additional intensive in-home support for people experiencing acute mental health problems. Mental health services The Mental Health (Treatment and Care) Amendment Bill 2014 will be implemented on March 2016. A training program is being developed to ensure that all staff is familiar with their responsibilities under the new Act. A new initiative will be established within the CAMHS and in partnership with education that will provide: early identification and treatment of children presenting with emerging mental illnesses/disorders mental health consultation and in-reach into primary health services targeted at children. To improve pathways of care for Canberra Hospital patients with mental illness, Mental Health, Justice Health and Alcohol and Drug Services will also collaborate with Critical Care Services at Canberra Hospital. Representatives from the Adult Mental Health Services and ACT-wide Mental Health Services programs will also meet regularly with Critical Care. The current community Adult Model of Care will be redesigned to ensure an improved integrated flow of patients from both inpatient and community settings\u2014crisis, assertive outreach, clinic and home-based care. A community mental health team will be established for the Gungahlin region. Currently services are provided to this area as an extension from the Belconnen Mental Health Team. Staff will be recruited to develop the therapeutic program, provide training, and develop policy and standards for the new 25-bed SMHU.The existing Consultation and Liaison service for people admitted to the general wards of Canberra Hospital who have mental health-related issues will be expanded. This will enable the service to operate after hours seven days per week A 20-bed, 24-hour supportive accommodation service will be established for people with significant chronic and severe mental health issues. This initiative is a collaborative partnership with the Community Services Directorate (CSD). Mental Health, Justice Health and Alcohol and Drug Services will also provide intensive support to people with psycho geriatric conditions living in residential care, or transitioning from an acute inpatient unit. This will provide assertive clinical assessment and treatment for Older Persons Mental Health Service (OPMHS) consumers residing in residential aged care facilities. The aim is to circumvent an acute psychiatric inpatient admission, wherever possible. Additionally, the service will assist in gradually transitioning consumers from an inpatient admission back into the community. It is envisaged that this service will reduce demand on inpatient beds. The AMHU has experienced challenges in the timely discharge of some patients. Primarily this is related to accessing appropriate housing options. Work is progressing to improve inter-agency relationships, particularly with ACT Housing, Disability ACT and the NDIA taskforce, to: ensure the needs of these people are appropriately met in the community reduce the impact on acute mental health inpatient beds. Alcohol and Drug services In terms of alcohol and drug services, Mental Health, Justice Health and Alcohol and Drug Services will enhance the Alcohol and Drug Service Consultation and Liaison services at Canberra Hospital. This includes expanding to a seven day per week service and introducing a nurse practitioner to enhance expertise within this service. Specialist Drug Treatment Services will: expand the outreach specialist medical, counselling and case management services provided at community health centres complement the existing services provided at Canberra Hospital. Justice Health Services The primary health team within Justice Health Services will be expanded to enable the effective delivery of health services within the AMC. This incorporates the proposed expansion of beds at the AMC between 2015 and 2016.SECTION B ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMACE65 ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMANCEOutput 1.3: Public Health Services The aim of Output 1.3 is to improve the health status of the ACT population through interventions which: promote behaviour changes to reduce susceptibility to illness alter the ACT environment to promote the health of the population promote interventions that remove or mitigate population health hazards. This includes programs that: evaluate and report on the health status of the ACT population assist in identifying particular health hazards and measures to reduce the risk to the health of the public from communicable diseases, environmental hazards and the supply of medicines and poisons. Overview The Population Health Division (PHD) has primary responsibility for managing population health issues within ACT Health. The division undertakes the core functions of: prevention assessment policy development and assurance. It also contributes to: local and national policy program delivery protocols on population health issues. In 2014, PHD commissioned an independent external review of the effectiveness of ACT Health's organisational approach to emergency management. The objective of the review was to: provide ACT Health with an independent, external analysis and opinion on the effectiveness of the directorate's approach to emergency management make recommendations for improvement. The review was conducted between May and June 2014. It included: analysis of legislation, plans and policy interviews with executives and managers who execute emergency management arrangements. The ACT Health Executive Council considered the external review report in late 2014 and again in April 2015. Of the eight recommendations made in the report, the council: fully agreed to three partially agreed to two disagreed with the remaining recommendations. The agreed recommendations relate to: reviewing and simplifying ACT Health's current suite of emergency plans, including the Health Emergency Plan clarifying identified triggers for internal escalation of emergency response providing a dedicated emergency exercise program and budget for the directorate renaming and clarifying the roles of the unit that provides core emergency management support to the Chief Health Officer and the broader directorate. The PHD is now developing an implementation plan in line with the Executive Council's determinations and will report regularly to the council on implementation progress. Performance against accountability indicators On 27 November 2014, the Food Amendment Bill was passed by the Legislative Assembly. The bill introduced provisions to reduce red tape for food businesses and non-profit community organisations that sell food for fundraising purposes. More information: Detailed information about the amendment is provided in the C.6 Statement of performance, Output 1.3: Public Health Services section, pag e 204. From 1 January 2015, food businesses have had the option of registering under the Food Act 2001 for up to three years, rather than annually. Food businesses that were required to notify their details to PHD are no longer required to do so, and the $57 fee previously charged to businesses for changing or updating their details has been abolished. From 20 April 2015, eligible non-profit community organisations have been removed from the operation of the Food Act 2001 , meaning there are no restrictions on the types of food they can sell as part of their fundraising activities. The changes have: reduced the regulatory burden on these organisations provided an incentive to sell more nutritious foods, such as salads, sandwiches and fruit, at community fundraising stalls.ACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-1566In line with ACT Government regulatory reforms and reducing red tape, PHD began implementing multi-year licenses and registrations for businesses and individuals. The aim was for 20 per cent of all licenses and registrations to be multi-year by the end of the financial year. The Health Protection Service was able to progress this program earlier than anticipated and achieved 100 per cent compliance in this area. More information: For additional information, se e C.6 Statement of performan ce, Output 1.3: Public Health Servic es, pag e 204. As part of a continuous review process, updated tobacco compliance testing procedures were introduced on 9 December 2014. The updated procedures clarify recruitment and training requirements, and streamline administrative processes. Compliance testing is an essential regulatory tool used across Australia to help reduce tobacco sales to young people. Altering the ACT environment On 8 December 2014, the ACT Health Air Quality Monitoring website was launched at the Health Protection Service. The website includes an Air Quality Index (AQI) value to indicate the cleanliness of ACT air; the lower the index, the better the quality of the air. The AQI provides a number that allows easy comparison of different pollutants, locations and time periods. The website provides real-time air quality data from the three air quality monitoring stations operated by ACT Health, which are located at: Monash Civic Florey. The stations at Monash and Florey monitor the following five pollutants: carbon monoxide nitrogen dioxide ozone particulate matter less than 10 microns (PM10) particulate matter less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5). The air quality station at Civic monitors ozone, PM10 and PM2.5.Interventions and mitigations To provide a collaborative and transparent approach to food regulation issues , PHD has established a Food Regulation Reference Group (FRRG), which meets quarterly. The FRRG first met in September 2014. Members include representatives from: industry public health and consumer groups ACT Government stakeholders. The PHD also drafted and coordinated input into the ACT Government Submission to the Standing Committee on Health, Ageing, Community and Social Services inquiry into the exposure draft of the Drugs of Dependence (Cannabis Use for Medical Purposes) Amendment Bill 2014 and related discussion paper. The PHD also developed the ACT Government submission to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry into the Regulator of Medicinal Cannabis Bill 2014 . In February 2015, a team of 11 public health officers conducted food inspections during the three- day National Multicultural Festival as part of a strategy to minimise public health risk from serious breaches of the Food Act 2001 . During inspections of food stalls, public health officers routinely look for issues (breaches) that would give rise to unacceptable food safety risks including: inadequate temperature control poor hand washing facilities inappropriate food storage. Over 290 inspections were conducted during the event. A number of food safety breaches were identified, resulting in five incidents of voluntary disposal of food. No food was seized. In May 2015, an extensive property clean-up was conducted under the Public Health Act 1997 due to an insanitary condition. The property had an accumulation of food and other material in and around the house. The food was decaying, odorous, providing harbourage for vermin and impacting on neighbours. Due to the tendency for this occupant to relapse and difficulties in managing hoarding cases, PHD has begun developing a multi-agency model for handling hoarding cases. On 7 May 2015, PHD hosted a forum for the staff of aged care facilities. The aim of the forum was to provide aged care facilities with information and advice for preventing and managing influenza and gastroenteritis outbreaks. It covered topics such as: SECTION B ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMACE67 ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMANCE the epidemiology of influenza and gastroenteritis in the ACT influenza vaccination outbreak management infection control. Presenters at the forum included staff from PHD and Canberra Hospital. More than 20 representatives from facilities in the ACT attended the forum. The Drugs and Poisons Information System (DAPIS) was successfully deployed in PHD in September 2014. DAPIS collects and records information about prescribing and supplying controlled medicine in the ACT . DAPIS enables pharmacies to submit electronic reports of controlled medicine supplies to PHD, which is used for monitoring purposes. All ACT pharmacies are now submitting their reports electronically to PHD every month (Phase 1). Phase 2 of the rollout will result in pharmacies reporting dispensing information in real-time. This is dependent on pharmacy software vendors making necessary updates to software. PHD is assisting software vendors in this regard. The ACT Chief Health Officer served a Disciplinary Notice on an ACT practicing pharmacist for failing to record controlled medicines dealings as prescribed by regulation and demonstrating a lack of accountability for controlled medicines. The proposed disciplinary actions included: a formal reprimand cancellation of the pharmacist's authority to deal with controlled medicines cancellation of the pharmacist's Opioid Dependency Treatment Licence a copy of the final disciplinary Decision Notice being forwarded to the Pharmacy Board of Australia. The final disciplinary action was reduced to a formal reprimand for the contraventions of the Medicines, Poisons and Therapeutic Goods Act 2008 . Health status evaluations and reports The PHD undertook or published the following population health surveys and data collections in 2014-15: The ACT General Health Survey (GHS), which is a telephone computer-assisted technology household survey that collects information on a range of factors influencing health status. The ACT Secondary Students Alcohol and Drug Survey, ( ASSAD ), which is a classroom-based questionnaire collecting information on risk behaviours of ACT secondary school students, including alcohol, tobacco and illicit drug use. Finalised the collection of birth and death data from The ACT Registrar of Birth, Death and Marriage. The division also: improved the completeness and timeliness of maternal and perinatal data and continued to report nationally against key indicators increased availability of public hospital data for data-linkage purposes through the NSW Cancer Institute, improved the quality and efficiency of ACT cancer registry data collection. To inform the future strategy of the ACT Cancer Registry an independent review was undertaken by experts in the field. Key recommendations are being implemented to improve the relevance, timeliness and flexibility of the information collected and able to be reported for public health benefit. The PHD continued to monitor, analyse and report on the health outcomes across the population through a variety of methods and formats including: Completing a proof of concept internet-based project to provide more timely access to population health data. Continuing capacity building to link different data sets through data-linkage with the Centre for Health Record Linkage in New South Wales. This provides an invaluable tool to better understand health challenges and outcomes across the ACT community. For example, ACT Health is collaborating on a project, using data- linkage to better understand the outcomes of cardiac care, with the aim of improving services. Continuing a partnership with the National Health and Medical Research Council's (NHMRC's) Australian Prevention Partnership Centre. The centre focuses on the primary prevention of chronic health conditions. Partnering with the ANU, after winning an Australian Research Council grant in 2012. This includes providing support for a PhD student research internship focused on dementia.ACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-1568Health hazards and countermeasures Exercise Melilla On 26 March 2015, PHD conducted a functional one-day exercise, named Exercise Melilla. The exercise took eight weeks to plan and develop and aimed to validate the preparedness of the ACT Health sector to identify, transport and treat a suspected case of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD). The scenario for Exercise Melilla involved: a role-player patient presenting at Calvary Hospital activating public health protocols by the Health Protection Service, Communicable Disease Control transporting the patient to Canberra Hospital via ACT Ambulance Service for reception and testing. The exercise included approximately 60 participants across four sites, and was a timely and valuable opportunity to practice infectious disease response coordination. Deregulation As part of the ACT Government's ongoing commitment to reducing red tape, PHD assessed public health regulation to identify areas that may be deregulated without compromising public health. The division's historical data showed that the ACT's licensed boarding houses and hairdressing businesses had high rates of compliance with public health requirements. The risk to public health from licensed boarding houses and hairdressers was therefore considered minimal. Based on this assessment the Minister for Health concluded that it should no longer be necessary for: boarding houses and hairdressing businesses to be declared public health risk activities or the occupation of hairdressing to be a declared public health risk procedure. Accordingly, the Minister for Health determined that from 1 January 2015 licenses under the ACT Public Health Act 1997 would no longer be required to operate a boarding house or a hairdressing business. The Health Protection Service has retained regulatory powers under the Public Health Act 1997 to address any condition that is, or may become, a public health risk or be offensive to community health standards. PHD will continue to investigate any public health complaints received from the community concerning practices at boarding houses and hairdressing businesses. Measles In 2014-15, eight cases of measles were notified in the ACT . All eight cases were in children that that had not been immunised. Four cases acquired their infections overseas. The remaining four cases were a family cluster with an unknown source of infection although likely acquired interstate. An increase in overseas-acquired measles cases has been observed nationally in recent years, highlighting the importance of measles vaccination, especially prior to overseas travel. In March 2014, Australia achieved measles- free status, as declared by the World Health Organisation (WHO). This means that Australia has: no local strain of measles circulating in the community well-performing surveillance systems to rapidly detect and respond to measles cases. Achieving measles-free status does not mean the complete absence of the disease in Australia, but recognises that cases will continue to be imported by travellers from countries where the disease is prevalent. PHD investigates and implements disease control measures for each confirmed case of measles under national guidelines. Since the beginning of 2010, 32 cases of measles have been notified in the ACT . Medicines Advisory Committee The Medicines, Poisons and Therapeutic Goods Regulation 2008 was amended on 23 October 2014 to increase the membership of the Medicines Advisory Committee from three to seven members. The Medicines Advisory Committee is an independent statutory committee that provides advice to the Chief Health Officer on complex matters relating to prescribing controlled medicine. The committee was expanded to allow a broader range of expertise and includes new pharmacist, pain or addiction specialist, GP and consumer positions. Ebola Virus Disease In April 2015, a multi-agency health response was required to investigate and manage a returned Health Care Worker (HCW) from Liberia who reported symptoms consistent with early Ebola Virus Disease (EVD). The HCW reported no known contact with Ebola cases and was considered as low risk for having acquired Ebola. SECTION B ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMACE69 ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMANCEA multi-agency response was enacted by the: Population Health Division (PHD) Canberra Hospital and Health Services (CHHS) ACT Ambulance Service (ACTAS). The HCW was transported to Canberra Hospital for treatment and testing. The HCW was subsequently confirmed negative for EVD and discharged to home quarantine. Following the response the division implemented a detailed After Action Review plan to capture relevant response diagnostics from participating agencies. A multi-agency debrief with PHD, CHHS, ACTAS and CSD was conducted on 23 April 2015. Findings from the multi-agency debrief concluded that overall the multi-agency response had worked well. Diagnostics identified a number of strategic- level improvements that could be realised. The recommendations arising from the review to streamline and strengthen future EVD responses will be managed through the Health Emergency Management Sub Committee, which is chaired by the Chief Health Officer. Future directions Behavioural changes As part of Future directions for tobacco reduction in the ACT 2013-2016 , PHD will investigate options to further restrict places of tobacco use. This will include a community consultation on creating new smoke-free areas in the ACT , with the aim of reducing the exposure of the community to environmental tobacco smoke. The PHD will also continue to work on improving the policy and legal framework that supports organ and tissue donation in the ACT . Amendments to arrangements related to organ and tissue donation aim to enhance efficiency and maximise clinical outcomes for organ recipients. Interventions and mitigations The division will continue to progress work to address the potential public health issues associated with the sale and use of electronic cigarettes.Health status evaluations and reports The PHD will continue to work towards enhancing knowledge of and raising awareness regarding the health risks associated with exposure to loose- fill asbestos. Health hazards and countermeasures PHD will continue to progress work on improvements to food regulation in the ACT , including its transparency. This work includes: improving stakeholder engagement further developing tools used by public health officers, for example guidelines, manuals and procedures improving information for food businesses and the public implementing a staff development program developing IT solutions to improve both data integrity and the efficiency and transparency of the food regulation system improving the effectiveness of food safety services. PHD continues to progress work on improving controlled medicines regulation in the ACT . Consultation was undertaken in 2013 on a proposed model to remove the current Chief Health Officer approval requirement for prescribing controlled medicines. This was to be coupled with improved prescription monitoring by PHD using pharmacy data. While the majority of stakeholders supported the proposal, some stakeholders have raised concerns that removing the current safeguards will put patients at risk. PHD is currently considering an alternative model to retain the approvals system for consideration by the Minister in 2015-16. As various inquiries into matters related to the medicinal use of cannabis are finalised, additional issues will need to be considered and significant analytical policy work will continue.ACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-1570Output 1.4: Cancer Services The division of Cancer, Ambulatory and Community Health Support provides: Canberra Region Cancer Services inclusive of a comprehensive range of cancer screening, assessment, diagnostic and treatment services palliative care services administration support to Ambulatory and Community Health sites. Services are provided in inpatient, outpatient and community settings. The key strategic priorities for cancer care services are early detection and timely access to diagnostic and treatment services. These include: ensuring that population screening rates for breast and cervical cancer meet targets ensuring that the waiting time for access to essential services, such as radiotherapy, are consistent with agreed benchmarks increasing the proportion of women screened through the BreastScreen Australia Program for the target population (aged 50 to 69 years) to 70 per cent over time. The division is also responsible for providing administrative and clinical support services across Canberra Hospital and Health Services, including: intake referral management booking and scheduling clinic management nursing and allied health to Central Outpatients transcription services. Overview Services commenced in the Canberra Region Cancer Centre (CRCC) on 18 August 2014. The centre is designed to improve the integration and standard of care to people with cancer in the ACT and surrounding region. A Medical Oncology Nurse Practitioner position has been recruited. In 2015-16, this position will be integrated into the operations of the CRCC Rapid Assessment Clinic. More information: Detailed information about the CRCC is provided in th e Canberra Region Cancer Cent re section, pag e 31. Cancer Services provided 1,428 radiotherapy treatment courses for new and returning patients during 2014-15. This is a 4.4 per cent increase on the same period last year. New referrals increased by 5.9 per cent during 2014-15.Cancer inpatient services increased with the opening of eight extra beds in ward 11C. This ward is designed to assist patients with their transition: between acute care services and the community prior to discharge during interstate transfers when having radiation treatment that require an inpatient bed from ward 14B to an awaiting a nursing home placement. During 2014-15, the Centre for Personalised Immunology was established. Clinicians from the Department of Immunology worked in collaboration with the centre and a broader collaborative network of Australian and international clinicians and scientist. Cancer Services also developed Cancer Psychosocial Service introduction postcards, which are designed to support access to and normalisation of psychosocial support for patients and families/carers following a cancer diagnosis. Two DVDs were developed and launched in 2014-15 to assist people when they or someone they care for is experiencing cancer: one DVD was for patients requiring radiotherapy, outlining what to expect during treatment the second DVD was for health professionals to assist in end-of-life conversations. The DVDs were developed with input from patients and carers. Funding sources included Dry July. Performance against accountability indicators BreastScreen ACT's access and uptake has continued to improve during 2014-15: 99 per cent of women wait less than 28 days for a screening appointment. For women requiring further investigation at an assessment clinic, 90 per cent were provided an appointment within 28 days from their initial breast screening appointment. 99.95 per cent of women with a normal result received a letter within 28 days. Breast and cervical cancer screening Achieving a 60 per cent participation rate in breast screening in the ACT remains a challenge for the BreastScreen Australia Program. Despite efforts, breast screening participation for the 50-69 year old cohort in the ACT has remained steady at 55 per cent. Efforts to encourage GPs to refer women to the program will be a focus in the coming year. More information: Detailed information is provided in the BreastScreen Australia Progr am section, pag e 71.SECTION B ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMACE71 ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMANCEEssential services wait times With the appointment of new specialists within Haematology the waitlist has been reduced from six months to triage category timeframes. This also provides the ability to continue to refine and improve the multidisciplinary approach to lymphoma care and clinics. The Haemophilia Treatment Centre (HTC) has been established and provides information and educational material for patients of all ages and their family and carers. Following receipt of a funding grant, the HTC has commenced an outreach program for: medical practitioners nursing staff paramedics local school teachers patients living in the rural NSW adjoining to ACT region and their families. To date, two programs have been undertaken involving an education program and follow-up visits by the haemophilia care providers. Both programs were very successful, increasing the attendee's knowledge of haemophilia and other bleeding disorders, and identifying the challenges that regional and rural families face. BreastScreen Australia Program From November 2014, BreastScreen ACT used Electoral Roll data and lapsed attendee reports to send breast screening invitation letters to women in the target age group (50-74 years). From November 2014 to 30 June 2015, BreastScreen ACT sent invitations to 10,370 women identified from the Electoral Roll. The program also instigated: follow-up phone calls to lapsed attendees letters and education sessions to GPs community information sessions stalls at various conventions resource distribution. Also in November 2014, BreastScreen ACT implemented the BreastScreen Information System (BIS). This is an electronic record keeping system, which is linked to the Picture Archival and Communication System (PACS). The implementation of the BIS aims to streamline administration and clinical processes, and better support the program's reporting requirements. Within the reporting period, the Breast Cancer Treatment Group completed 15 years of breast cancer treatment data from the ACT and Southern NSW Region. This significant body of work will provide cancer services in the region with data on the treatment outcomes for women with breast cancer. The report is due for release in October 2015. BreastScreen ACT was awarded a Reconciliation Recognition Certificate for work with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community in the ACT . Administrative and clinical support The Ambulatory Care Administration Model project saw significant progress in relation to standardisation of administration processes across CHHS. This included significant work to address problems with ambulatory care data reporting. While the Ambulatory Care Administration Model has progressed in relation to standard processes, the required structural changes are still being implemented. The model's success is dependent on these changes in structure and governance, which will be fully implemented by the end of 2015. A major restructure of ACTPAS clinics commenced in June 2015. This will enable improved data reporting for all ambulatory services and provide: a clinic hierarchy reflective of the current organisational structure allow for comprehensive territory and national reporting of non-admitted services allow for more comprehensive and flexible reporting at a local level to assist with service planning activities. Transcription services resolved the backlog in transcribing, which was due to the significant increase in demand for outpatient services at Canberra Hospital. This was achieved by increasing the use of outsource providers. It has resulted in all specialities achieving receipt of letters for approval within the five day performance indicator. Community Health Intake successfully incorporated the ACT Health Dental Program Intake. This provides a single point of intake for a wider range of community-based services. It resulted in call volumes increasing by 50 percent over the year compared to the previous year.ACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-1572Oncology The Medical Oncology Research Unit received a grant of $50,000 from the Monaro Committee for Cancer Research, to support its research program. The Department of Medical Oncology continues to contribute to collaborative research with 16 clinical studies open to enrolment. In 2014-15, it: published 18 journal articles and four book chapters had an additional five papers accepted for publication contributed to 42 research abstracts presented at various local, national and international conferences. ACT Health became a formal research partner of the Centre for Oncology Education and Research Translation (CONCERT), which is: a collaboration between cancer research groups within South Western Sydney, Illawarra Shoalhaven and the ACT Health districts funded by a grant from the Cancer Institute NSW. The aim is to systematically and collaboratively study specific cancers in-depth and to develop new technologies and methods to improve treatments, quality of life and outcomes for patients with cancer. Radiation Oncology has increased active participation in clinical trials. The department's strategic research directions align with national cooperative clinical trial research groups, such as the Trans Tasman Radiation Oncology Group (TROG). There are high levels of representation, engagement and contributions from all clinical groups within the department. The Radiation Oncology Private Practice Trust Fund continues to support a significant number of research personnel within the department. This has had a positive effect in: progressing the research developing and implementing new technologies and making these available to patients implementing investigator-initiated projects, enabling the education and further specialisation of radiation oncology staff. Awards and nominations A number of awards and nominations were received during 2014-15: The Centre for Personalised Immunology was recently awarded a prestigious National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Centre of Research Excellence grant. The Palliative Radiotherapy Rapid Access Clinic (PRRAC) project team were finalists in the ACT Quality in Healthcare Awards in the category of Access and Efficiency. The 2014 Award for Allied Health Team Excellence was awarded to the Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) team in recognition of outstanding commitment to the development, trial and implementation of a multidisciplinary SRS treatment service. The Palliative Care team were winners in the ACT Public Service Awards for Integrity, with recognition of how the team worked together to take responsibility and accountability for health support and care decisions and actions. All team members provide the upmost patient care with compassion, understanding, dignity and respect. Future directions During 2015-2016, Cancer Services will: continue the growth of translational research and clinical trials expand multidisciplinary team services, including a specific Myeloma multidisciplinary team (MDT) and clinic develop a sub specialty thrombosis, haemostasis and platelet service, which will be achieved with the appointment of an eighth staff specialist. Models of Care for cancer services will continue to be developed, to enable improved quality of care while addressing the increasing demand for services Survivorship Model of Care data is still being analysed to determine future directions that are important in providing this service. Breast and cervical cancer screening A breast screening clinic will open at the BCHC in the latter half of 2015. This will increase accessibility and ensure an increased capacity to accommodate the expansion of the target age group to target women aged 70-74 years. ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMANCE Administrative and clinical support When the Ambulatory Care Administration Model is fully implemented, the focus across CHHS will be to embed standardised processes and create sustainable systems, supported by appropriate technologies. Ultimately this will allow all processes across the continuum from referral to discharge to be better managed, including ambulatory care waiting list management. While transcription services have dramatically improved over the past year, a review of the current model is needed. This review will consider a number of options to provide an efficient, timely, flexible and sustainable transcription service across CHHS. An education package designed to increase awareness of haemophilia in Canberra Hospital and other health care providers is being developed. Community Health Intake is planned to expand to provide a comprehensive intake service across CHHS over the coming year. This will assist in achieving a single point of intake for consumers of ACT Health services. Radiation Oncology Technology capabilities are a critical component of the Radiation Therapy service. Updated technology through the Radiation Oncology Major Equipment program provides efficiencies and improvements to radiation therapy services. Planned future replacement of end-of-life major equipment will provide further efficiencies and improve access to more targeted radiation therapy treatments, such as Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT). The planned integration of the ARIA oncology information system with other ACT Health systems will support: increased efficiency streamlined processes establishing an electronic medical record. Implementing new technologies enables improved treatments and outcomes for patients. However, the increasing complexity, planning and treatment time is resulting in an increase in demand for Radiation Oncologists, Radiation Therapists and Physics groups and presents ongoing challenges to ensure patients are treated within safe timelines. Radiation Oncology will continue developing the following clinical projects: Expanding verification imaging capabilities, including developing a credentialing program. Developing respiratory gating, including: 4D image acquisition, to improve tumour definition deep inspiration breath hold techniques, to reduce the radiation dose to critical organs. Expanding the application of IMRT to include prostate cancer treatment. Expanding the use of ARIA, which is the oncology information management system. Developing scripting to automate radiotherapy treatment planning system processes and provide process efficiencies. Increasing access to IMRT in Radiation Oncology from the current 12 per cent of patients to the recommended 30 to 40 per cent, depending on clinical case mix. 73 SECTION B ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMACEACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-1574Output 1.5: Rehabilitation, Aged and Community Care The aim of Output 1.5 is to provide an integrated, effective and timely response to rehabilitation, aged care and community care services in inpatient, outpatient, Emergency Department, subacute and community-based settings. The key strategic priorities for Rehabilitation, Aged and Community Care (RACC) are: ensuring that access is consistent with clinical need, is timely for community-based nursing and allied health services and that community- based services are in place to better provide for the acute and post-acute healthcare needs of the community improving discharge planning to minimise the likelihood of re-admission or inadequate support for independent living, following completion of hospital care ensuring that hospitalised older persons wait an appropriate time for access to comprehensive assessment by the Aged Care Assessment Team (ACAT), which assist in their: safe return home with appropriate support accessing appropriately supported residential accommodation. Overview The Exercise Physiology Department commenced input into the School Kids Intervention Program (SKIP), which is a family-centred, multidisciplinary service within the Division of Women, Youth and Children for children aged 4-12 years who are overweight or obese. The program was developed based on the recommendations of the Obesity Service Redesign Project 2012. It has been developed with the aim to support a number of ACT Government's plans and strategies, including the: Children's Plan 2010-14 Towards Zero Growth Healthy Weight Action Plan. The program commenced in March 2015 and aims to improve the health and wellbeing of children and their families. More information: For detailed information about SKIP , se e Output 1.6: Early Intervention and Preventio n, Programs Promoting healthy lifestyle choices, page 88.The Veteran Liaison Service successfully hosted an ANZAC Day Service to commemorate the 100th Anniversary of the landing at Gallipoli. A representative of the Turkish Embassy attended the service. The Veteran Liaison Service received a 'Love Award' from the Canberra Hospital Foundation to refurbish their lounge and kitchen area. The RACC Psychology and Counselling service has been restructured to include new graduate and junior positions for clinical psychology and neuropsychology. They, along with the Speech Pathologists, have been responsible for introducing a Cognitive Remediation Program for patients both in hospital and in the community. The aim of this program is to increase and improve the cognitive re-training of patients. Performance against accountability indicators The Community Nursing and Allied Health performance exceeded the 2014-15 targets for: number of nursing occasions of service, which was set at 82,000 number of allied health regional services, which was set at 22,600. This was achieved by: recruiting additional allied health and nursing positions, which expanded community- based services implementing changed models of care. More information: For additional information, see C.6 Statement of perform ance, Output 1.5: Rehabilitation, Aged and Community Care, p age 231 . Rehabilitation In May 2015, the Rehabilitation and Aged Care Outpatient Clinics relocated to larger premises. The new location in Building 3 of Canberra Hospital provides patients with a more relaxed environment, which assists both the clinician and patient during the assessment or consultative process. Speech Therapy began using iPads in the inpatient wards (12B and RILU). The aim was to increase therapeutic communication time by introducing innovative activities. This activity has provided the following benefits: assisted when running small communication groups allows patients to practice independently between sessions has indirectly increased social communication between patients on the wardsSECTION B ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMACE75 ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMANCE allows interactive language and speech practise using app technology can also be used to assist patients with cognitive communication difficulties in working on cognitive domains such as attention, memory and executive function. Speech Pathology services use began using telehealth in MDT settings. Aged care Reduced access to residential aged care beds has continued to impact on the average length of stay. However, with the opening of new beds across the ACT (in July 2015) this may improve. Community care A number of community-based services have reported growth in demand. Podiatry referrals have increased from by 11.23 per cent from 2013-14 to 2014-15. Physiotherapy referrals increased by 21.5 per cent over the same period. Referrals for palliative care to the Community Care Nursing service are expected to rise in response to the increased need for primary palliative care services for the ACT community. This will place pressure on the existing capacity of Community Nursing, who will continue to work with Calvary Hospital Home-Based Palliative Care, who provides the specialist component of palliative care services. The improved Community Nursing performance can be attributed to increased capacity of the service, with growth funding available to the City, Tuggeranong and Belconnen nursing teams. In addition, the foot clinics, which were previously attended by Community Nursing, are now provided by the Podiatry team. An additional RN was recruited to the Self Management of Chronic Conditions Program in early 2014. This has resulted in increasing the number of chronic conditions group courses by 48 per cent. The community-based allied health services have also grown, with the Community Podiatry, Nutrition and Physiotherapy teams expanding. Physiotherapy Assistants review clinics have been implemented in our community team while Occupational Therapy assessment clinics have also been established at the Independent Living Centre (ILC). Our Community Nutrition team has commenced services to renal patients at Belconnen and Tuggeranong Community Health Centres.The Community Rehabilitation Team (CRT) and Falls Assessment and Prevention Services have also expanded with introduction of additional: Occupational Therapists Physiotherapists Allied Health Assistants. Dementia care Canberra Hospital is one of four national hospitals selected to be a national partner with Ballarat Health Services, to implement and evaluate the Dementia Care in Hospital Program (DCHP). This program is funded by the Commonwealth Department of Social Services (DSS). It is an all of hospital education program aimed at improving hospital care of patients with cognitive impairment. ACT Health Human Research Ethics Committee approval is currently being sought. Alzheimer's Australia is a strong supporter of the project. Its representative and a representative of the Health Care Consumers Association (HCCA) will be involved in the project steering group. Referrals to the Driver Assessment and Rehabilitation Service (DARS) have increased, especially for older drivers with dementia, which presents an ongoing challenge. An increase of approximately 100 referrals to this service has been recorded over the last two years. Access to services The Transitional Therapy and Care Program (TTCP) occupancy continues to increase, with an expected occupancy for 2014-15 of approximately 80 per cent. This has been achieved by altering the service model and improving the staffing profile. Demand for our equipment services has also increased: As at 30 June 2015, the Domiciliary Oxygen and Respiratory Support Scheme (DORSS) were supporting 1,356 clients compared to 1,228 clients at 30 June 2014. This is an increase of 10 per cent. The Equipment Loan Service (ELS) provided 10,722 items of equipment to clients in the community to facilitate hospital discharges and aid rehabilitation. In 2013-14, 10,222 items were provided. This was an increase of 500 items. As part of a joint initiative between CRT and the Palliative Care service from Calvary Hospital, the cross-service clinic model for clients with Motor Neurone Disease (MND) was reviewed. Changes were made to improve the continuity of care for clients attending and increase satisfaction of the team.ACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-1576Video-teleconferencing was also introduced for clients with MND in regional NSW. RACC continues to actively support student education. Health Workforce Authority (HWA) funding received in 2014-15 was used to provide four staff members with experience in clinical educator positions. This activity was undertaken as a part of a succession planning and retention strategy. The Coordinator of Community Geriatric Service Rapid Assessment Deteriorating Aged at Risk (RADAR) Service, Geriatric Outpatients and Memory Assessment Service (ROM) commenced within the RACC team in January 2015. This has resulted in a more unified approach to the outpatient-based services provided by RADAR, Geriatric Outpatient Clinics and the Memory Assessment Service. Hospitalised older persons In September 2014, the Sub-acute Geriatric Unit (SAGU), ward 11B, was established in Canberra Hospital. This unit is staffed by an MDT and increased the inpatient bed capacity of Canberra Hospital by 18. These 18 beds comprise: 10 subacute geriatric beds eight beds for non-acute patients awaiting residential aged care placement. This allowed eight inpatients residing at Goodwin Aged Care Service Monash to transfer back to Canberra Hospital. The falls minimisation rooms in wards 11A and 11B were both highly praised by the surveyors in the May 2015 National Safety and Quality Health Service Standards (NSQHSS) survey. Awards and presentations A number of RACC staff received awards during 2014-15: Laura-Jayne Van Alphen was awarded the Allied Health Professional of the Year 2014. Kathryn Pettigrove was nominated for Early Career Excellence Award for 2014 and was awarded with a Recognition of Service. Jaspreet Singh was awarded the Allied Health Assistant of the Year 2014. The RACC Inpatient Leadership Team was nominated for a 2015 ACT Nursing and Midwifery Excellence Award.A number of RACC staff gave notable presentations during 2014-15: The Physiotherapy Clinical Educator presented at the World Congress of Physical Therapy in Singapore on her PhD research findings on Stroke Rehabilitation. Dr Sarah Walker, Clinical Psychologist, presented at the 2014 Canberra Health Annual Research Meeting on her PhD findings concerning Driving Cessation in Later Life. Mr Yu-Lung Chan and Dr Harriet Downing presented at the 2014 Allied Health Symposium, The Brain That Trains Itself, outlining cognitive remediation and its application in a rehabilitation setting. The Exercise Physiology Department presented a research poster at the ACT Health Allied Health Symposium, demonstrating the value of implementing a behaviour change tool designed to assist patients in self managing their condition. Clinical Technology Services (CTS) presented a paper and a poster at the Australian Rehabilitation and Assistive Technology Association (ARATA) national conference held in Canberra in August 2014. Future directions The Australian Government continues to implement significant reforms of the aged care and disability sectors, which present challenges to the: operations and funding of RACC services communications to RACC clients, referrers and the community. Rehabilitation Growth funding received in the 2015-16 budget will be used to establish a new community- based rehabilitation service. This will increase collaboration with inpatient services and increase a seamless transition between services. A cognitive remediation working group will be developed for patients who have had a stroke or have a traumatic brain injury. Dementia care The Dementia Care in Hospitals Program will be implemented from July 2015. The program aims to raise awareness of and support for more dementia-friendly and supportive environments in Canberra Hospital. Wards 11A, 6A and 5A will be pilot wards for the program.SECTION B ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMACE77 ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMANCEAccess to services From 1 July 2015, ACT ACAT will transition to the My Aged Care system. The transition period for ACT ACAT is from 1 July 2015 to 1 September 2015, when it is expected the ACAT will be fully operational within the My Aged Care portal. My Aged Care will become the single mandatory gateway into aged care services, and will: implement a central client record implement a nationally consistent standardised screening and assessment process manage electronic referrals via the My Aged Care online portal strengthen consumer-directed care. The planning process for moving outpatient clinics to Building 15 will include: determining whether reduced space will impact services determining if some clinics may be better placed in the Community Health Centres using the staging and decanting process to ensure a smooth transition into the new premises. Occupational Therapy will continue to trial an alternative model of service delivery to ensure equity of service delivery to subacute and chronic neurological caseloads. The goal is to provide a timely, early intervention, interprofessional rehabilitation service to consumers. RACC continues to be an active participant in a range of Health Infrastructure programs including the establishment of the UCPH. Planning continues for UCPH, which is scheduled for opening in early 2018. During 2015-16, the Cognitive Remediation Program will be evaluated and quality improvements will be completed. Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT) groups will be implemented. Management of the LSVT waiting list will improve, with an extra staff member being trained in the use of the LSVT companion. In terms of models of care: Service development will continue to examine models of care, service provision and use of allied health assistant (AHA) roles in all clinical areas. For example, CRT is implementing a stream type model within the current Occupational Therapy staffing to provide a more responsive service across the main client groups of subacute and chronic neurological. The Model of Care of the Memory Assessment Service will be reviewed to identify methods for increasing patient flow in the Outpatient Clinic. In terms of staffing: Active recruitment is progressively filling vacant specialist staff positions in Geriatric Medicine. This will reduce the excessive workload on existing staff and improve streamlining of services. All vacant positions are expected to be filled by end of 2015. Occupational Therapy has experienced staff shortages. While it is anticipated that there will continue to be several staff on temporary contracts in Occupational Therapy, all positions will be filled by August 2015. The Electronic Medication Management System will be implemented across the RACC inpatient services in early 2016. It will improve medication management and reduce medication errors. Discharge planning Statistics indicate 100 patients in the 85 years and older age group will be sent home from the Emergency Department each month. However, approximately 70 per cent of those will return to the Emergency Department and be admitted to hospital. The ROM service is currently developing robust and efficient strategies to reduce hospital admission rates for these patients.ACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-1578Output 1.6: Early Intervention and Prevention The aim of Output 1.6 to improve the health and wellbeing of the ACT population through a range of programs, services and initiatives, focused on early intervention, prevention and health promotion. The key strategic priorities for early intervention and prevention include: encouraging and promoting healthy lifestyle choices to decrease the rates of conditions such as obesity and diabetes reducing risky health behaviours, such as smoking and alcohol consumption maintaining high levels of immunisation. Overview ACT Health undertakes initiatives that provide early intervention to, or prevent, health conditions that may result in major acute or chronic health care burdens on the community. Early intervention is managed in many ways, including: screening programs, such as BreastScreen, Cervical Screening and Newborn Hearing Screening immunisation programs health promotion programs and initiatives behaviour-changing campaigns. ACT Health supports a comprehensive range of programs aimed at primary prevention to reduce the onset, causes and complications of chronic diseases. ACT Health primary prevention programs are aimed at quantifying and preventing chronic disease across the ACT population. Performance against accountability indicators The ACT continued to achieve high childhood immunisation coverage in the general population. Coverage rates for children all three cohorts were consistently above the national average. The ACT achieved the highest coverage rate of all states and territories in all quarterly reports for children at 12 months of age. In 2014-15, ACT childhood immunisation coverage rates remained above the national target of 90 per cent for 12-month-old children. ACT Health's target of 92 per cent of one-year-old children being fully immunised was exceeded in all quarters (92.5 per cent, 93.1 per cent, 92.9 per cent and 92.9 per cent).Well Women's Checks were provided to 40 per cent of women from Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) communities. This is in line with the target of 40 per cent, which is an increase in target from 30 per cent in 2013-14. In collaboration with the Health Improvement Branch, which oversees the Cervical Screening register, eligibility criteria for Well Women's Checks were reviewed to include: young women who had previously not initiated a cervical screening test women who have not been screened for over three years. This is believed to be consistent with the eligibility criteria targeting vulnerable women. 93 per cent of children aged 0-4 years who entered substitute and kinship care in the ACT were referred to the Child at Risk Health Unit's Out-of-Home Care Clinic. This is above the target of 90 per cent. More information: For additional information, see C.6 Statement of perform ance, Output 1.6: Early Intervention and Preven tion, p age 231. Promoting healthy lifestyle choices The cessation of the National Partnership Agreement on Population Health (NPAPH) in the 2014-15 Federal Budget created significant funding shortfalls for health promotion programs. However, the ACT Government continued to support the majority of NPAPH-related programs for 2014-15 and has provided additional support in the 2015-16 budget through its Healthier Lifestyles initiative. During 2014-15, Population Health Division continued to deliver initiatives aimed at improving the health of the population in a range of settings and population groups including children, families and workers. Children ACT Health delivers programs aimed at reducing the rates of overweight and obesity in children and young people aged 0-18 years. The Kids at Play (Active Play) Program contributes to improved developmental outcomes for children aged three to five years in Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) services. Thirty-five ECEC services in Canberra participated in the program in July 2014. Forty schools are involved in the Fresh Tastes: healthy food at school Program, which aims to improve student and teacher knowledge of and access to healthy food and drinks. Fresh Tastes provides curriculum support in: SECTION B ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMACE79 ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMANCE nutrition education growing food healthy cooking healthy food and drink options. A number of businesses and community organisations partner and support the schools. Out of 50 school canteens assessed annually, over one-third showed a decrease in unhealthy food on their menus. The Healthy Food at Sport Program aims to increase healthy food choices available to children and young people through sporting canteens. Fifty-two ACT primary schools are involved in the Ride or Walk to School (RWTS) Program, which aims to increase physical activity. The program is delivered by the Physical Activity Foundation through a Healthy Canberra Grant. It provides support for teacher professional development and workshops on: bikes and helmets self defence BMX riding. ACT Health continues to work with cross-government partnerships with other directorates to develop an extension of RWTS named Active Streets to trial infrastructure improvements around schools and identify strategies to better engage parents. The It's Your Move is a high school research intervention program conducted with Deakin University. It aims to increase physical activity and healthy eating and reduce unhealthy weight gain in young people aged 12-16 years. Numerous positive outcomes were demonstrated including improved student attitudes, knowledge and behaviours related to physical activity and nutrition. The rates of overweight and obesity in the target group decreased or remained stable over the study period. This program has informed the development of It's Your Move phase two involving nine ACT high schools. Families The Good Habits for Life Program is a locally- developed behaviour change campaign, which targets families with young children, and encourages physical activity and healthy eating. The campaign website has received over 30,000 visits since its launch in November 2014.Workers ACT Health delivers programs to promote and support healthy lifestyles within, and through, ACT workplaces. The ACT Healthier Work Service has been developed by Health Improvement Branch and implemented with WorkSafe ACT . It supports ACT workplaces to implement staff health and wellbeing programs. Over 100 local businesses are engaged in the program and over 50 businesses across a range of sectors achieved Healthier Work recognition. From 2015-16 onwards the Healthier Work Service will be delivered through Access Canberra. ACT Health runs 'my health' , which is a comprehensive staff health and wellbeing program Healthy Workers | ACT Health for the ACT Health workforce of over 6,000 employees. As a part of the program, ACT Health introduced the Healthy Food and Drink Choices Policy to increase the range and number of healthy food and drink choices available to staff, volunteers and visitors at ACT Health facilities and events. As a result: drink vending machines are largely compliant with the policy 'junk food' advertising has been removed from Canberra Hospital lifts contracts for food outlets across ACT Health include a requirement to comply with the Policy. Grants The ACT Health Promotion Grants Program provided $1,838,730 in grants to a wide range of community-based organisations. The grants fund activities that help improve health outcomes and minimise the risk of developing chronic disease. The focus of grants funding has been on identified population health issues, including overweight and obesity, and smoking and alcohol-related harms. Early intervention and prevention programs BreastScreen ACT is part of a national population breast screening program that is aimed at reducing deaths from breast cancer through early detection. More information: For detailed information about BreastScreen ACT , see Performance anal Cancer Serv ices age 70.ACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-1580During 2014-15, the ACT Cervical Screening Program: promoted an updated message of 'regular cervical screening test' to community groups using print media, at women's health events and through 98 per cent of general practices delivered a radio advertising campaign to promote screening to women from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community, and women from non-English speaking backgrounds, in 21 language groups. As part of the Commonwealth-funded National Bowel Cancer Screening Program (NBCSP), endoscopy services are provided to patients. In 2014-15, CHHS operated a colonoscopy pathway to support NBCSP participants for those referred to the service. The School Youth Health Nurse works with a preventative focus in high schools including activities associated with: early identification brief intervention harm minimisation. The nurse is often the first point of contact for young people, their families and school community members seeking information, advice and support in health matters. More information: For detailed information, see B.2 Performance analysis , Output 1.1: Acute Serv ices Early intervention and preven tion, page 57 . The Asthma Nurse Educator Service provides asthma education and support to children, young people, families and community groups. The focus is on clients understanding and managing their asthma to prevent acute episodes. Work to increase awareness of this valuable service has seen demand grow by 60 per cent over the last five years. Newborn Hearing Screenings are provided to every newborn in the ACT and aim to: identify babies born with significant hearing loss introduce them to appropriate services as soon as possible. More information: For detailed information, see B.2 Performance analysis , Output 1.1: Acute Serv ices, Early intervention and preven tion, page 57. The results of the kindergarten health checks are now sent to the family's GP (if nominated on the consent form) for ongoing support.The School Kids Intervention Program (SKIP) commenced as a pilot on March 2015. This program is for children 4-12 years who are overweight, either on the: 85% percentile or above with co-morbidities or 95% co-morbidities. The program is family-oriented and incorporates multidisciplinary information, including nutrition paediatric (medical) psychology exercise physiology. SKIP received 30 referrals in the three months since commencement. The Dental Health Program collaborates with child and family centres to provide oral health information and support to families of young children. Key activities of this collaboration include: conducting outreach dental assessments facilitating dental appointments educating parents. The First Smiles Program promotes early intervention for young children with a strong focus on early childhood caries and dental trauma prevention and management. Dental assessments and information sessions are delivered to children at: playgroups preschools community events, for example, Floriade. ACT Health funded the ACT Medicare Local (now the Capital Health Network) to run a 12 month demonstration primary health care service aimed at disadvantaged ACT citizens attending the Early Morning Centre in the city. This commenced in June 2014 and continued throughout 2015. Implementation of the ACT Primary Health Care Strategy 2011-2014 was completed in December 2014 with all 47 sub actions implemented or in progress. A new document to steer the direction of future primary health care-related activities in the ACT is being developed.SECTION B ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMACE81 ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMANCEImmunisation rates From the beginning of 2013, the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccine, Gardasil, was offered to boys and girls in Year 7. The catch-up program for male Year 9 students ceased in December 2014. The ACT remains above the national average in students receiving the full three-dose HPV vaccine. Preliminary data on the HPV vaccine administered through the school immunisation program indicates the following uptake rates for the 2014 calendar year: Year 7 students: 78% Year 9 boys: 66 % Throughout the school year, the school-based immunisation program also provides students with booster doses of the: varicella (chickenpox) vaccine combined diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus vaccine. During 2014-15, the Maternal and Child Health (MACH) Service delivered 11,838 early childhood immunisations. The National Partnership Agreement on Essential Vaccines sets out performance benchmarks that must be achieved for the ACT to be eligible for an incentive payment. The performance benchmarks associated with the Essential Vaccines Agreement are: maintaining or increasing vaccine coverage for Indigenous Australians maintaining or increasing coverage in agreed areas of low immunisation coverage maintaining or decreasing wastage and leakage maintaining or increasing vaccination coverage for four-year-olds. The ACT cannot be assessed against benchmark 2, as the ACT does not have any identified areas of low immunisation coverage. In 2013-14, the ACT achieved all three of the assessable benchmarks (benchmarks 1, 3 and 4). More information: For information on the status of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander immunisation, see Strategic Objective 14: Addressing Gaps in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Immunisation Status, p age 45 . Implementing the ACT Immunisation Strategy 2012-2016 continued, with work targeted at maintaining ACT immunisation coverage rates and reaching vulnerable community members.Changes to the National Immunisation Program continue to be implemented within the ACT . One new change in 2015 is the expansion of the program to include providing the influenza vaccine free for all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children aged six months to five years. In March 2015, the Australian Immunisation Handbook (10th Edition) was amended to recommend that the pertussis (whooping cough) vaccine be provided for women in their third trimester of pregnancy. In April 2015, ACT Health introduced a funded Antenatal Pertussis Vaccination Program aimed at protecting both mother and her newborn from whooping cough. Vaccines and promotional materials were delivered to all GPs and antenatal clinics as part of the program. PHD undertook a quarterly mail-out to parents of children who were recorded in the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register as overdue for immunisation, either because: they have not been vaccinated or their vaccination has not been recorded on the register by their immunisation provider. The letter advised parents or guardians that their child was overdue for immunisation, reminded them of the importance of vaccination and enabled any administered but unrecorded vaccinations to be entered onto the register. In March 2015, PHD commenced sending reminders to parents for their child's upcoming four-year-old immunisation. In 2015-16, this will be expanded to include children due for their one-year and 18-months vaccinations. Future directions Promoting healthy lifestyle choices ACT Health will continue to contribute strongly to implementing actions listed in the Towards Zero Growth: Healthy Weight Action Plan. The action plan is a crucial element of efforts aimed at reducing the burden of disease associated with overweight and obesity. The PHD chairs the ACT Healthy Weight Initiative Food Environment Implementation Group (FEIG) and the Evaluation Implementation Group (EIG). Under the auspices of the FEIG, additional drinking water fountains have been installed in public places to increase access to, and promote, drinking water. ACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-1582The Minister for Heath accepted a report from the Heart Foundation ACT , which highlighted the extent of marketing of unhealthy food and beverages to children in the ACT . The EIG has made significant progress in: improving the collection of biometric data in General Practice collecting data in relation to the usage of ACT Government walking and cycling infrastructure. Reducing risky behaviours PHD will continue to focus on services and programs that prevent chronic disease and reduce related health care costs across the ACT community. The focus for 2015-16 will be on reducing lifestyle risk factors that lead to: overweight and obesity diseases such as cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular conditions. The PHD will also focus on monitoring health trends and outcomes and making that data and evidence available in a timely and accessible fashion for decision-making.Immunisation rates PHD will continue to work with the Department of Health during 2015-16 to implement changes to the National Immunisation Program Schedule. A number of new vaccines are to be added to the schedule, including the Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis (DTP) booster for children aged 18 months, which will be added in October 2015. Increasing and maintaining high immunisation coverage rates in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children will continue to be a challenge. The Health Protection Service is actively pursuing different strategies to increase immunisation rates for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, including: phone contact with parents of children identified as overdue for immunisations discussions with stakeholders liaising with Winnunga Nimmityjah Aboriginal Health Service investigating immunisation promotion opportunities with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community.

Government Response/ Submission TitleThe Government Response is not due as at 30 June 2015. Date Tabled/ Released5 May 2015. Recommendation Number and Summary of RecommendationRecommendation 10 : The Committee recommends that the ACT Government consider annual benchmarking for emergency department timeliness against peer group hospitals to provide a better indication of how the ACT is performing compared to similar hospitals. Recommendation 12 : The Committee recommends that ACT Government consider establishing targets to measure how effectively diversion to other health care and human services management programs is working to reduce frequent re-presentations at emergency departments. Recommendation 13 : The Committee recommends that ACT Government look to revise its information systems promptly in order to facilitate the recording and reporting of timeliness measures for non-elective surgery. Recommendation 14 : The Committee recommends that the ACT Government undertake additional efforts to ensure that hospital staff comply with hand washing guidelines. ACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-1584Reporting Entity Standing Committee on Health, Ageing, Community and Social Services ActionRecommendation 10 - Agreed. ACT Health will endeavour to incorporate national peer group hospital results into our annual report for benchmarking purposes. Currently, ACT Health does not have access to national datasets for the purpose of generating our own national comparative figures. As such, ACT relies on data that is made available to jurisdictions via national publications. ACT Health currently sources national peer group results and individual hospitals performance results from federal bodies such as the Australian Institute of Health & Welfare (AIHW) and the National Hospital Performance Authority (NHPA) annual hospital publications retrospectivity. As these national publications can often take some time before they are made available to jurisdictions, ACT Health cannot guarantee that the inclusion of the most recent national data into our annual report. Nevertheless, ACT Health will incorporate historic publicised national results into our annual report as per data availability. Recommendation 12 - Agreed in Principle. ACT Health is working with the ACT Primary Health Network (PHN) (formally ACT Medicare Local) to develop initiatives which are aimed at reducing pressure on Emergency Departments by providing better community based options. This initiative will initially focus on those with chronic conditions and those who present regularly at ED's. Further extension will be determined following an evaluation of the work with the ACT PHN. Recommendation 13 - Agreed. This recommendation is currently a high priority for ACT Health. ACT Health currently working on ways to improve the capturing and reporting of non-elective surgery information to provide greater transparency in of this area. Recommendation 14 - Agreed. ACT Health strives to achieve continuous improvements in all areas including compliance with hand hygiene requirements. Since 2010 the Hand Hygiene Program at Canberra Hospital and Health Services (CHHS) has been coordinated via the Infection Prevention and Control Unit (IPCU) at Canberra Hospital, and has involved a multi- factorial approach to hand hygiene compliance ranging through education, audit and feedback, promotional activities, equipment and supplies, and focused area or unit specific intervention, with specific examples listed below. During this time the Hand Hygiene program has not only expanded significantly across the health service, but has also resulted in a steady increase in hand hygiene compliance (see graph), although further improvement is required, especially among Medical Practitioners. Following each audit period the IPCU analyses the results according to the ward area, moment of hand hygiene and type of healthcare worker, to determine the areas to target with specific interventions prior to the next audit cycle. Whilst the IPCU has been essential in coordinating the program, the importance of individual ward areas and healthcare worker groups in leading and driving the program at a local level needs to be recognised. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 Audit 1 2013 Audit 2 2013 Audit 3 2013 Audit 1 2014 Audit 2 2014 Audit 3 2014 Audit 1 2015 Overall audit result Benchmark SECTION B ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMACE85 ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMANCEReporting Entity Standing Committee on Health, Ageing, Community and Social Services Action (continued)Program : CHHS run the hand hygiene program as per the '5 moments' set out by Hand Hygiene Australia in conjunction with the Commission on Safety and Quality. The program now takes in 21 wards/units across the service, leaving only three areas which will be on the program by the third and final round of 2015. All staff undertake essential infection prevention and control training and to date for 2015 2500 staff have been trained in the '5 moments of Hand Hygiene' and infection control practices. This number includes doctors, nurses and allied health. Round 1 of 2015 involved 18 units with a total of 6091 moments collected, with an overall rate of 78.7 per cent being achieved. IPCU run auditor training monthly successful completion of which requires passing an exam to ensure the data collected is valid and accurate. Each ward/unit collects their own moments and this has been an effective way to collect the data as it ensures staff owns the information within their unit. They also see and handle problems or issues and address them as they arise, which is a more effective way to learn. In addition to the national hand hygiene program, ACT Health run an auditing process of which the hand hygiene snapshot is a part. The snapshot reflects the national program and allows auditing to take place in the community and the outpatient setting. Alcohol hand rub is readily available across ACT Health to make it easy to perform hand hygiene. It is available at the entry to wards, point of use within wards and in all outpatient settings. Interventions include : International Hand Hygiene Day (children from Woden Valley Childcare Centre helped to raise awareness); International infection control day in October (wear pink t-shirts and encourage wards to hold hand hygiene awareness days, e.g. 10A and women's and children often hold pink days); Infection control, 'Bug Busters' and hand hygiene newsletters are circulated every month; IPCU nurses provide on-the-spot positive and constructive feedback to staff from all disciplines. Feedback from each audit period is provided to those wards/units that have been part of the Hand Hygiene program, including compliance rates and graphs to display. Education and promotion is provided to wards/units that don't meet the national benchmark during an audit period. The Infection Control have fun days to promote hand hygiene and good infection control practices, for example, an annual 'Bake off' with the theme of 'My Hospital Rules' . 'No touch' hand hygiene stations are situated in all foyers and entry points across the ACT Health. A DVD has been developed and is on a replay loop in the foyer (this DVD was based on Chesterfield Hospital in the UK). Skin assessment service is provided by infection control to ensure staff who develop skin irritations are reviewed.

The ACT Government has a range of mechanisms through which it collects health data of ACT school students. ACT school student's health and fitness status is reported biennially in the Chief Health Officer's report. Annual statistics are available. The Education and Training Directorate is working in partnership across ACT Government agencies to develop and implement programs that enhance children's health and fitness. Action in schools is a high priority area within the Towards Zero Growth Health Weight Action Plan. Schools are already engaged with programs to improve the physical health of children such as the Walk and Ride to School Program, supporting schools canteens to provide healthy food choices and building physical activity into the school day. The Epidemiology Section of ACT Health collects and reports on the health and fitness status of primary and secondary school aged students in the ACT through several surveys including the ACT General Health Survey (GHS), the ACT Physical Activity and Nutrition Survey (ACTPANS), and the Australian Secondary Students' Alcohol and Drug Survey (ASSAD). The GHS is conducted annually, while the ASSAD and ACTPANS are conducted every three years. Recommendation 92 - Not agreed. ACT Health routinely undertakes evaluation of its programs, many of which have historically been funded through the Healthy Children Initiative under the National Partnership Agreement on Preventive Health. The Commonwealth Government ceased this Agreement on 1 July 2014 and, accordingly, funding to the underlying programs has been cut. The ACT Government is currently looking at the impacts of this loss of funding. Recommendation 94 - Agreed in principle. The Government will examine this proposal during the 2015-16 Budget process. Recommendation 95 - Noted. The ACT has not yet received a formal response to its request for detail to explain the derivation of the figures in the 2013-14 and 2014-15 Budgets. Recommendation 96 - Noted. There are only three outstanding issues in relation to the Auditor-General's report: a single sign-on system that reduces the time for people to log-on to the system, as a means of eliminating the need for generic passwords; adoption of new outcome measures for emergency department services; and completion of relevant documentation for the system, in term of education, training, auditing and governance. Two of these required the implementation of the new version of the emergency department information system in order to complete the actions. The new system was implemented in late June 2014, and work is now underway to complete these actions. In relation to outcome measures, the ACT is leading a national effort to consider possible outcome measures. This process will be completed in late 2014. Recommendation 97 - Agreed. Substantial work has been undertaken since the completion of the field work of the Auditor-General's office for this audit. ACT Health has introduced changes to improve processes for acceptance and registration of referrals and is focusing on increasing the Gastroenterology consultants' utilisation of IT systems to triage, in an effort to streamline referral processing and booking of patients into clinics. Enhancements to the electronic referral system have also been identified and are being developed, which will improve the Gastroenterology and Hepatology Unit's visibility of their demand, enabling better management of appointment requirements. Recommendation 98 - Agreed. This will occur as part of the ACT Government's response to the Auditor-General's report. Recommendation 99 - Noted. The ACT Government will consider reporting to the Legislative Assembly at an appropriate time. Recommendation 100 - Agreed in principle. The Government notes the comments in the report in relation to the significant challenges associated with budgeting accurately for the timing of delivery of health related infrastructure. The CMTEDD has implemented The Capital Framework, designed to enhance the evaluation of the scope, cost and timing of capital works prior to any budget funding being allocated. Recommendation 101 - Noted. Following the cessation of the National Partnership Agreement on Preventive Health from 1 July 2014, funding for programs under the Healthy Workers Initiative has been cut. The ACT Government is currently looking at the impacts of this. Funding from the Healthy Canberra Grants Program to the Heart Foundation will deliver the Live Lighter campaign, targeting adults, to increase awareness around obesity and promotion of increasing physical activity and healthier eating. Recommendation 102 - Noted. The service is already available to patients discharged from private hospitals in the ACT .ACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-1588Reporting Entity Select Committee on Estimates 2014-2015 Action (continued)Recommendation 10 3 - Agreed. The document currently in development (the ACT Mental Health and Wellbeing (Suicide Prevention) Framework 2015-2025) is positioned at a strategic, Whole-of-Government and whole of community level. The document identifies high level goals to promote mental health and wellbeing and reduce suicide and self-harm across all age groups. Interventions for specific vulnerable groups, whether aged based, gender, ethnic groups, etc are not identified. Following the endorsement of the above Framework, each Directorate will develop a business plan or strategic policy to address the Framework objectives. It is within these documents that interventions targeted at specific groups will be contained. ACT Heath will develop a Mental Health Services Plan that will contain strategies targeted at various higher risk groups including older people at risk of suicide. Recommendation 104 - Noted. While the Government is committed to improving data collection in relation to alcohol-related harms in other areas, the collection of additional information above current requirements in emergency situations is not supported at this time. It is important that health services, and especially ambulance paramedics and clinical staff in the hospital emergency departments, manage presentations based on clinical need and record the primary condition they are treating, not the apparent cause of the condition.

To achieve this, ACT Health is committed to managing risks that may prevent us achieving our objectives. Developing the Risk Management Plan In line with ACT Government risk management protocols, the ACT Health Risk Management policy, framework and guidelines are maintained in full compliance with the International Standard for risk management, which is AS/NZS ISO 31000:2009. The documents provide clear governance arrangements, including responsibilities and measurable KPIs. ACT Health is committed to establishing a risk culture that demonstrates the principles of risk management through: proactive, timely identification and reporting of actual and perceived risks by staff including risk in the planning, implementation and maintenance phases of all ACT Health systems, processes, policies and procedures. Monitoring risks Executive Risk Management forums and workshops are held regularly to review the directorate's organisational-level risks. Identifying and responding to emerging risks ACT Health's Executive Directors' Council is responsible for: monitoring the timely, effective management of organisational-level risks managing the escalation of risks to an organisational level.SECTION B ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMACE91 ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMANCEOverview The ACT Government Internal Audit Framework provides guidance for all internal audit functions within the ACT Government. ACT Health's Internal Audit Charter and Internal Audit Policy and Procedures are based on this framework and guide the work performed by ACT Health's Internal Audit and Risk Management Branch. Internal Audit Arrangements ACT Health's Internal Audit and Risk Management Branch promotes and improves ACT Health's corporate governance by: conducting internal audits and investigations making recommendations for improvements. In 2014-15, six internal audit assignments were completed. An ACT Health Internal Control Review was also completed. Audit findings and recommendations are rated in line with ACT Health's Risk Management Guidelines. Throughout the year, the Manager, Internal Audit and Risk Management reported developments in implementing: the Strategic Internal Audit Program audit recommendations to the Executive Directors' Council and to the Audit and Risk Management Committee. The committee is also informed of the implementation of recommendations made by the ACT Auditor- General's Office, where these apply to ACT Health. Internal Audit Committee ACT Health's Audit and Risk Management Committee Charter and Terms of Reference govern the operation of the Audit and Risk Management Committee, which provides: assurance to the Director-General on ACT Health's governance oversight in relation to risk management, internal systems and legislative compliance. The committee consists of five members: an independent chair three Senior Executives from within ACT Health one external member. Observers from ACT Health and the ACT Auditor- General's Office also attend meetings. The committee is supported by ACT Health's Manager, Internal Audit and Risk Management.

To address this obligation ACT Health has: a Fraud and Corruption Policy a Fraud and Corruption Plan. The Deputy Directors-General and Executive Directors are responsible for ensuring compliance with the policy and plan at all levels within their areas. Risk assessments and fraud prevention strategies Divisions of ACT Health undertake fraud risk assessments, in line with ACT Health Risk Management protocols. Mitigating controls are put in place to address fraud threats and risks. The ACT Health Senior Executive responsible for Business Integrity Risk: analyses trends and risk assessments for fraud and other integrity breaches provides biannual reports to the Audit and Risk Management Committee. The one fraud matter reported in the 2013-14 Annual Report has been finalised. No fraud matters were reported in 2014-15. Fraud control plans and fraud awareness training Staff receive fraud control and prevention training during orientation and through an e-learning program titled Ethics, Integrity and Fraud Prevention. Managers are provided with further fraud control and prevention information and training during managers' orientation programs. This is supported by targeted information that alerts staff to the responsibilities and protocols intended to improve systems or mitigate identified fraud threats and risks.SECTION B ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMACE93 ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMANCEIntroduction/overview Our priority\u2014a safe and healthy working environment for all employees. Work Health and Safety within ACT Health is primarily the responsibility of the management team. This responsibility is shared with all staff. Workplace Safety (WPS) has overarching responsibility for ensuring that ACT Health has an effective Work Health and Safety Management System (WHSMS). The WHSMS assists management and staff to: identify, manage, monitor and report safety hazards and their associated risks meet legislative compliance as far as is reasonably practicable. WPS provides occupational medicine services across ACT Health to prevent potential infectious disease being transmitted to healthcare workers. These services include: pre-employment screening a vaccination program, including annual influenza vaccinations occupational risk exposure and follow-up management, counselling and advice cytotoxic screening monitoring safety devices health surveillance education. WPS also provides a holistic early intervention physiotherapy service to staff who have sustained musculoskeletal injuries. This assists in: reducing time off work facilitating early return to work improving staff morale decreasing workers compensation claims. A priority is educating staff to increase their awareness of safe work practices and ergonomic environments.WPS has operational responsibility for the Riskman system. This allows ACT Health to configure the system to meet business needs, including providing support to stakeholders using the system to coordinate issues with the ACT Health's divisions and services. The Riskman system currently consists of nine registers and associated extensions. More information: For detailed information, see Riskman , page 148. Workplace safety measures During 2014-15, the WHSMS was reviewed and updated to reflect changes to: legislation regulations and codes of practice operational requirements processes. WPS also developed an asbestos management plan, which has been implemented across the organisation. Additional workplace safety measures undertaken during 2014-15 are discussed below. Riskman The electronic staff accident and incident reporting system (Riskman) is now in its sixth year of operation. This system continues to provide consistent reporting and enables ACT Health to quickly: identify and implement relevant controls report incident and trend data to management and workplace Health and Safety Representatives (HSRs). The Riskman system continues to be developed to meet organisational needs both in clinical and non- clinical areas. Various registers and extensions were upgraded to: provide customised reports, indicator sets and body charts improve functionality.B.7 WORK HEALTH AND SAFETYACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-1594Staff/management feedback has led to the development of a more user-friendly system, which allows higher quality reporting to management and committees. This will be fully implemented in 2016. An Occupational Medicine Unit Riskman module has been developed to capture data for staff screening and immunisation, including annual influenza vaccinations and occupational risk exposures. Safety training and auditing Safety training remains a priority and continues to be provided for HSRs, managers and new staff. The Work Health and Safety Managers course and Investigation course assist managers to: implement relevant preventive and corrective safety controls continuously improve safety in the workplace. ACT Health received accreditation in 2015 from WorkSafe ACT as a Registered Training Organisation (RTO) to provide tailored HSR training for our staff. ACT Health has developed its own internal safety auditing tool in response to feedback from management and staff. This enables ACT Health to meet corporate and legislative requirements. Work Health and Safety Act 2011 reporting Incidents, accidents, investigations and notices in 2014-15 were as follows: 1,318 accident/incident reports were lodged during the 2014-15 financial year. This compares with 1,367 lodged during the preceding year. Of these reports, 151 resulted in lost time injury of one day or more, compared with 158 in 2013-14. 40 accidents/incidents relating to ACT Health staff were notified to ACT WorkSafe under section 35 of the Work Health and Safety Act 2011 , compared to 54 in 2013-14. One Provisional Improvement Notice (PIN) was issued by an ACT Health HSR in 2014-15: The PIN was issued on 25 July 2014. The PIN was placed on the Adult Mental Health Unit (AMHU) by the AMHU's HSR. It related to concerns for staff safety related to staffing levels at the unit following a post occupancy evaluation. The PIN was lifted on 31 October 2014, following negotiations with management. No notices of noncompliance were issued in 2014-15 in relation to the Work Health and Safety Act 2011 . One prohibition notice was issued to ACT Health in February 2015 in relation to construction activity under Regulation 296 of the Workplace Health and Safety Regulation 2011. WorkSafe identified that a principal contractor had not been appointed for this construction activity. There were no workplace fatalities in 2014-15. Health and Safety Representatives At 30 June 2015 there were 268 elected Health and Safety Representatives (HSRs) within the Health Directorate. Worker consultation arrangements The ACT Health Tier 1 Work Health Safety Committee is the peak organisational body for work health and safety in ACT Health. It met four times during the year. This committee is chaired by the Director-General and includes management and workplace HSRs. Tier 2 Health and Safety Committees are chaired by Executive Directors and represent major divisions and branches. Tier 2 committees meet quarterly (in administrative environments) and monthly (in clinical environments). These committees must include more HSRs than management representatives. Tier 3 Health and Safety Committees represent localised work areas and bring together groups within similar locations/job types. Tier 3 committees meet monthly. WPS Early Intervention Physiotherapy Program The WPS Early Intervention Physiotherapy Program completed 579 workstation assessments during the 2014-15. Workstation assessments may also be conducted to support an employee returning to work where a work or non-work injury has occurred.SECTION B ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMACE95 ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMANCEPerformance against Australian Work Health and Safety Strategy 2012-22 targets Target 1: A reduction of at least 30 per cent in the incidence rate of claims resulting in one or more weeks off work Figure 19 and Table 22 shows the number of new claims per 1,000 employees that resulted in five or more days off work since 2012-13.

The overall trend in performance on these claims has been achieved with early intervention strategies and proactive case management.SECTION B ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMACE97 ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMANCEIntroduction/overview ACT Health has a dispersed model for human resources management with many areas sharing responsibility for staff-related issues. Business units are responsible for deciding their workforce composition below the executive level. They make their own recruitment decisions and undertake day-to-day management duties. People Strategy and Services Branch (PSSB) assists business units with their human resources functions, especially in complex or difficult cases. The most common areas where this occurs are: where allegations of misconduct have been made team interventions are required to address specific workplace culture issues advice on public sector employment obligations is needed it is difficult to recruit staff with particular skills or qualifications. PSSB is also responsible for whole of directorate and/or strategic human resources issues, such as: providing general clinical and leadership training conducting enterprise bargaining negotiations conducting high-level workforce planning and directorate-wide people policy. The Chief Minister, Treasury and Economic Development Directorate (CMTEDD) provides whole-of-service human resources policy, strategy and programs. It: sets targets for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and People with Disability authorises the employment of executives provides transactional human resources services through its Shared Services centre. All powers in relation to the appointment, engagement and employment of staff are exercised on delegation from the Head of Service or the Director-General of ACT Health.Human resource management The organisation's workforce profile reflects the increased health workforce that is required for the growing organisation, including: implementing new and extended services in the community sector of the ACT meeting ongoing service delivery growth within the hospital. To ensure that the services provided by ACT Health reflect best practice in national/international services the models of care for clinical areas are regularly reviewed. ACT Health is engaged in the national health workforce committees, including the: Australian Health Workforce Ministerial Advisory Council (AHWMC) Health Workforce Principal Committee (HWPC). This ensures that the organisation is aligned to the National Agenda for health workforce policy and planning. Workforce planning The aim of ACT Health workforce planning is to ensure that the right person, with the right skills is in the right place at the right time to provide the right services within budget. Workforce planning guides the recruitment, retention and development of ACT Health's diverse clinical and non-clinical workforce. Workforce projections are developed using contemporary methodologies, and gap analysis provides a guide to the recruitment needs of the organisation. ACT Health's largest recurrent expense is the cost of employees, with approximately 80 per cent of recurrent funds being spent on workforce. The ACT Health Workforce Plan 2013-2018 identifies the following five focus areas: Health Workforce Reform Health Workforce Development Health Workforce Leadership Health Workforce Planning Health Workforce Policy. B.8 HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGEMENTACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-1598The organisation is tracking well against all focus areas, with demonstrated collaboration between strategic and operational areas of the organisation to implement and evaluate the changes. The organisation is one of the largest employers in the ACT and we need to ensure that people with the right skill sets are recruited. To keep ACT Health facilities and services operating efficiently and effectively we need: doctors, nurses and allied health personnel administrative, technical and support workers. Using targeted recruitment strategies and collaborating with local tertiary education facilities to grow our own health workforce has been a successful approach. The first biannual ACT Health Workforce Summit 'Leading workforce risk mitigation initiatives' was held on 12 March 2015. Executive Directors from across ACT Health discussed workforce planning as a tool for workforce leaders and attended a workshop focused on key challenges and risks. The strategic management of the workforce was identified as one of the greatest challenges for workforce leaders for the next decade. The group found that ACT Health is required to: maximise the flexibility of the workforce minimise workforce risks constantly develop skills to remain abreast of ongoing changes, while retaining valuable skills. The group then focused on identifying strategies to: mitigate the risks and support the workforce to deliver on required outcomes help the organisation overcome workforce challenges. Retention strategies Recruitment and retention strategies are being implemented to ensure that we have a workforce into the future with the organisational knowledge, skills and capability to provide health services of the highest standard. ACT Health's exit rate was 7.1 per cent, which is less than the national average. Recommendations made in Exit Survey Reports indicate we need to increase the focus on working conditions and staff support measures, including: supporting flexible work arrangements strengthening the options for part-time or casual re-employment of retired and retiring staff members. Learning and development opportunities are provided to staff in accordance with the Essential Education Policy. Continuing professional development opportunities for staff include: development of health professional networks across ACT Health discipline-specific professional development clinical supervision workshops for supervisors. Workplace culture and engagement continue to be an area of priority for ACT Health, given the strong correlation with retention and overall performance. An effective internal consultancy service for managers/teams enabled effective analysis of workplace culture issues and targeted strategies, which took into account the unique factors of each team. In 2014-15, 48 teams from across the organisation received this targeted assistance, with good improvement outcomes. ACT Health offers retired employees opportunities to re-enter the workforce in a part-time or casual capacity. Opportunities that allow early retired employees to return in roles that are less physically demanding have been explored. ACT Health has been accepted into the 2014-15 Commonwealth Department of Employment Corporate Champions Program, which supports the development and implementation of strategies to retain workers aged 45 or over. A work plan has been approved for the rollout of the Corporate Champions program and implementation has commenced. Employment strategies ACT Health offers a range of competitive incentives to ensure it is a desirable place of employment for clinical and non-clinical professionals. Ongoing professional development to both cohorts of staff is offered through a range of avenues including: internal and external training targeted employment projects through the performance development plans. ACT Health has worked strategically with the ANU and other approved higher education institutions to ensure medical students are provided with the relevant support to perform their duties while also undertaking further professional development or targeted placements for junior medical staff. In June 2014, an Employment Inclusion Manager was permanently engaged to undertake initiatives and provide support and assistance within ACT Health to increase the number of employees that have a disability or are Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander.SECTION B ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMACE99 ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMANCEA large part of the inclusion work has focused on assisting, educating and developing staff and managers on the employment inclusion area for people with a disability and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. This has involved meeting with areas to discuss inclusion placements and then providing support for staff and management once a placement has been undertaken. To increase staff awareness regarding employment inclusion, two separate monthly inclusion seminars have been conducted. The presentation topics included: Disability and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Employment and training ideas, benefits and opportunities the support and funding available to managers. In April 2015, ACT Health began an Employment Inclusion partnership with Chief Minister Treasury and Economic Development Directorate (CMTEDD). The partnership will focus on the Disability and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Employment Inclusion initiatives to be undertaken to increase the number of inclusion staff across all directorates. The ACT Health and CMTEDD partnership on inclusion employment initiatives commenced in 2015. As part of this, monthly ACT Health Inclusion Seminars and presentations have been opened up to all ACT Government directorates. In June 2015, the Head of Service invited representatives from the directorates to attend the inclusion seminar held on 30 June 2015. This invitation is one of the first steps to establishing a whole-of-ACT Government Inclusion Practitioners network. A panel of Disability and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander employment providers was established through the Employment Inclusion Manager, which aims to: seek people who are available for work with ACT Health provide support, advice and possible funding towards workplace modifications, adjustments and support. The Disability Employment Providers, through the Employment Inclusion Manager, also provide assistance, support, education and training to the supervisors and work colleagues in the workplace.Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people The ACT Health Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Workforce Action Plan 2013-2018 (Workforce Action Plan) sits under the organisation's Workforce Plan 2013-2018 (Health Workforce Plan). During 2014-15, the Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) Committee was established. It consists of ACT Health representatives. The committee, in consultation with Reconciliation Australia and the ACT Elected Body and Community: reviewed the second RAP 2012-15 created the new third ACT Health RAP for the period covering 2015-18. Managers are encouraged to use the enterprise agreement's flexible working arrangements, where appropriate, to achieve a healthy balance between operational needs and work-life balance. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander employees are provided with details of their entitlements to attend culturally significant events. People with a Disability During 2014-15, the Disability Employment Action Plan Committee was established. It consists of representatives from across ACT Health and consulted with other ACT Government directorates, including the: ACT Human Rights Commission Australian Network on Disability Commonwealth Human Rights office. The committee was responsible for the creating and establishing ACT Health's first Disability Employment Action Plan. The ACT Health Disability Employment Action Plan 2015-2018 was released in January 2015 and is registered with the Commonwealth Human Rights Office. Apprenticeships In the 2013-2014 period, ACT Health commenced its first inclusion Australian School-Based Apprentice (ASBA), which was for an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Apprentice. During 2014-15, ACT Health increased this number to six Inclusion ASBAs, with three being Disability and three being Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander. The ASBA Program has been very successful and we will be working towards increasing these numbers in the upcoming financial year.ACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-15100Traineeships In 2015, ACT Health started an Employment Inclusion partnership with CMTEDD. It will focus on the Disability and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Employment Inclusion initiatives to be undertaken to increase the number of inclusion staff across all directorates. This has included involving the: 2016 Graduate Program Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Traineeship, which commenced in August 2015. Future traineeships will include a disability placement traineeship, cadetships and other development programs. Learning and development programs In 2014-15, participation in learning and development increased. This satisfied the quality improvements for health accreditation education requirements, as outlined in the National Safety and Quality Service Standards. This is reflected in an increase in e-learning completions, which doubled from the previous year. Some face-to-face programs now use a blended approach or were replaced by e-learning programs. This has provided a more flexible and cost effective delivery that meets the needs of the workforce. ACT Health implements governance strategies to ensure the quality of education and training in ACT Health. Planned and integrated education is based on the annual learning needs analysis and identified organisational requirements. ACT Health is a Registered Training Organisation (RTO), which provides a quality framework for delivery of training in line with the Standards for RTO 2015. A Standard Operating Procedure guides the design, development and approval of training programs. The Education Activity Register (EAR) monitors all programs registered on the learning management system (Capabiliti). In 2014-15, 155 programs were recorded on the EAR. The EAR ensures programs: are reviewed are evaluated are linked to evidence-based practice involve consumers are updated annually are appropriately authorised. In 2014-15, key achievements included: establishing partnerships and networks across ACT Health to develop and implement the education required to achieve health accreditation and organisational priorities meeting education reporting requirements for the National Safety and Quality Health Service Standards (NSQHSS) accreditation increasing medical officer engagement with essential education successfully implementing a planned process to ensure Visiting Medical Officers (VMOs) meet essential education requirements. Leadership and culture programs The ACT Health Leadership Network is composed of approximately 100 employees who have been identified by the executive as leaders and potential leaders who could most benefit from, and contribute to, the network's objectives. During the three workshops held in 2014, participants further developed their individual leadership skills. Activities included: presentations from guest speakers examining contemporary leadership research participating in network discussions. The employees worked in small collaborative groups and formed constructive partnerships across the organisation. Specific leadership programs were developed and delivered for Canberra Hospital and Health Services and for Strategy and Corporate. These programs involved over 120 staff (executives, senior and middle managers) participating in six to eight days of training in topics such as: leading through vision instilling accountability facilitating effective teamwork. The People Manager Program (PMP) aims to develop knowledge and skills in people management, and is underpinned by ACT Health's values. The PMP is for clinicians and non-clinicians in frontline supervisor and middle management positions who have people management responsibilities. It consists of five half-day modules, which were in significant demand in 2014-15. Table 24 shows the attendance figures.SECTION B ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMACE101 ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMANCETable 24: Number of Attendances for each module in 2014-15 Module Number of attendees Module 1 153 Module 2 151 Module 3 161 Module 4 187 Module 5 151 The ACT Public Service (ACTPS) Performance Framework was supported by the development and delivery of information sessions for all staff and workshops for supervisors and managers.

The scheme supports allied health professionals to undertake further learning at postgraduate level in either: clinical practice education and training research management and leadership. In 2014-15, the Chief Allied Health Office supported 54 individual postgraduate scholarship payments. The Nursing and Midwifery Office manages a range of scholarships for employed nurses and midwives to support their ongoing learning and education. These include scholarships for: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander ENs post-registration travel mental health clinical leadership and management. Post-registration scholarships continue to support the greatest number of nurses and midwives, with a total of 173 recipients during the 2014 calendar year. This reflects growth of 24 per cent on the 2013 calendar year. Funding support for between 50 and 100 per cent of course costs is provided. Recipients range from ENs undertaking a Bachelor of Nursing qualification (10 per cent) to RNs studying at graduate certificate/diploma level (49 per cent) and at Masters level (35 per cent). Student support programs Postgraduate certificates for ACT Health nurses and midwives The following postgraduate certificates are offered to nurses and midwives in collaboration with the Australian Catholic University (ACU): Neonatal Nursing Child and Adolescent Health. The ACU delivers an online component for two units, and educators in the ACT Health Staff Development Unit teach a curriculum approved by the ACU for the remaining two units in each course. SECTION B ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMACE107 ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMANCEThis education model combines theory and experiential learning. The advantages for ACT Health of using this model are that participating staff are well educated for local practice, with their study tailored to work area requirements. ACT Health staff who are students are able to work and study at the same time and do not pay fees for the ACT Health component. Once postgraduate certificates are completed students have an option to continue and undertake a Masters degree in their speciality. Table 32 provides course details.

Tertiary students The Student Clinical Placement Unit coordinates clinical placements for nursing, midwifery, medical and allied health students. Collaborative partnerships exist between ACT Health and education providers from 36 tertiary and vocational training facilities throughout Australia. A diverse range of placement options are available in ACT Health facilities that provide opportunities for students to integrate theory into clinical practice. Professional development opportunities are also provided in ACT Health facilities for RNs and midwives from regional health services and the Australian Defence Force. The Student Placement Online (SPO) management system provides a platform for pre-placement preparation, including e-learning programs for legislative compliance before commencing a clinical placement. In 2014-15, 28,937 clinical placement days were provided to nursing and midwifery students. Night duty clinical placements continued for third year nursing students and again received positive feedback from the students, facilitators and clinicians. In 2014-15, 10, 327 clinical placement days were provided to local, interstate and international students across the allied health disciplines and medicine.Work experience in ACT Health for school students ACT Health provides educational and practical healthcare work experience placements to ACT Year 10, 11 and 12 students in either clinical or non-clinical areas. Availability of placements is the decision of the senior manager of the area requested to provide the placement. The ACT Health Orientation evaluation asks new staff commencing employment to identify if they were previously a work experience student in ACT Health. In November 2014, the Staff Development Unit began to audit orientation evaluations. Since November 2014, 52 new staff identified that they had previously been a school work experience student in ACT Health. e-learning Currently, 70 e-learning courses are available on the learning management system Capabiliti. The courses are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. During 2014-15, 17 new courses were implemented on Capabiliti. In addition, 15 courses are under development and review, and a further 14 courses were evaluated and redeveloped. Table 33, Table 34 an d Table 35 provide details.

Progress: The Chief Health Officer decided against including the health impact of indoor air quality in the ACT in the Chief Health Officer's Report 2014. It is not considered a health priority at present. Recommendation 10 (ii) : Improve local air quality outdoors through installing and operating a second performance air monitoring station to ensure that the ACT is compliant with NEPM standards. Progress : The Ambient Air Quality (AAQ) National Environmental Protection Measure (NEPM) Performance Monitoring Station (PMS) at Florey is fully operational and the ACT is now compliant with the AAQ NEPM. Recommendation 10 (iii) : Improve local air quality outdoors, through determining the feasibility, including costs, of mobile monitoring of appropriate ambient air quality NEPM standards at locations in and around Canberra. Progress : This recommendation is not supported. ACT Health has examined the feasibility of this recommendation and determined that it would be cost-prohibitive and the quality of obtained data would be insufficient for any meaningful evaluation or policy making. ACT Health actively supports whole-of-government and continues to work towards embedding sustainability initiatives into the delivery of service to achieve the ACT Government's target of zero net emissions by 2020. ACT Health has developed policies, programs and plans to promote Environmentally Sustainable Development (ESD), including economic, social and environmental considerations in decision-making processes, as required by the Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas Reduction Act 2010 and the Environment Protection Act 1997 .ACT Health actively participates in the ACT Government Carbon Neutral Government Implementation Committee and Buildings and Infrastructure Sub Committee. In 2014-15, ACT Health's contribution to the Carbon Neutral Government Fund (CNGF) was calculated at $98,570. The contribution was made as part of Cabinet's decision to reallocate out-year GreenPower purchases, to allow energy efficiency projects to be implemented across ACT Government. ACT Health commenced work to renew its Sustainability Strategy, Resource Management Plan (RMP) and Environmental Principles and Guidelines - Building and Infrastructure Projects documents. The Sustainability Strategy Action Plan is being rolled into the RMP . ACT Health provided a supported framework for staff to set up Green Teams. Energy ACT Health began using the Enterprise Sustainability Platform (ESP) database to capture data for analysis and reporting purposes and to inform operational management of trends and potential energy usage reduction strategies. A Sustainability Committee (the Health Planning and Infrastructure Sustainability Reference Group) has been established within ACT Health to review the energy efficiency and whole-of-life costing of building elements of all new builds. This aims to assist in reducing carbon emissions. A feasibility study was undertaken to support an application to the CNGF to install solar photovoltaic (PV) panels on the roof of the southern multi-storey car park at Canberra Hospital, in conjunction with rolling out LED lighting to buildings on the hospital campus. The application to the CNGF was submitted in May 2015. Initiatives incorporated into the various ACT Health new building projects, upgrades and improvements, aimed at reducing carbon emissions include:B.9 ECOLOGICALLY SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-15112 installing energy efficient lighting, including emergency lighting installing motion sensors for lighting in office areas installing energy efficient window glazing, including double glazing in some areas installing intelligent networked lighting controls using paints, glues and sealants with low Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) replacing the old boiler system for heating and old chiller units with high efficiency Variable Air Volume (VRV) units (at Tuggeranong only) assessing the economy mode usage on damper air intake of air conditioning implementing a new Building IQ system and building analytical software to improve the use of utilities in Property Management and Maintenance analysing the ACTSmart Enterprise Sustainable Platform to help identify saving opportunities. Water The clinical and domestic services delivered by ACT Health rely heavily on water usage, including: patients showers theatre operations sterilising surgical equipment. Efficient water initiatives incorporated into the various ACT Health new buildings, upgrades and improvements aimed at reducing water usage include: re-using Reverse Osmosis (RO) water from the renal process in the toilet facilities at identified community health centres installing flow restrictors on a range of plumbing fixtures, for example, showers, hand basins and toilets installing motion sensors where applicable, while considering infection control issues considering the water usage star rating when replacing old, broken or obsolete equipment, where practical replacing heating pipe work and associated works at Canberra Hospital, in accordance with the preventative maintenance schedule upgrading boilers at Canberra Hospital continuing restrictions on the use of potable (drinkable) water for outside watering at all ACT Health facilities deactivating all garden sprinklers and decommissioning fountains conducting metering analysis of water utilisation at Canberra Hospital and reporting on any anomalies continuing tank water usage for outdoor garden watering and external washing of facilities, buildings and pavements, where tanks are installed analysing the ACTSmart Enterprise Sustainable Platform to help identify saving opportunities. Waste ACT Health is deploying the ACTSmart Recycling Program across both acute and non-acute sites. In 2015, the ACTSmart Online Recycling Training was made available to staff. It provides education and guidance on the impacts and outcomes the program can deliver at health sites to improve resource recovery and reduce waste. ACT Health, the Auditor's Office and Community Services Directorate, all located at 11 Moore Street, submitted a nomination in the Corporate category of the ACTSmart Awards 2015. The three directorates applied a collaborative approach to implementing sustainable waste management within the building, including separating: organic waste mixed-recyclables land-fill. The application was not successful this year. Transport ACT Health currently has three electric vehicles in its fleet. We continue to explore opportunities to include additional electric vehicles and additional charge stations at key ACT Health facilities to support these vehicles. The total fleet is 321 vehicles. ACT Health assesses replacement vehicles for efficiencies, both fuel and greenhouse gas emissions, when vehicle replacement occurs. Staff are encouraged to use active travel (walk, bus or bike) for trips less than four kilometres instead of using motor vehicles. Fuel usages decreased during the 2014-15 financial year. More information: For more information, see Table 51 , page 133. ACT Health continues to encourage staff car pooling and has designated car parks spaces at Canberra Hospital for those staff who participate in this option.SECTION B ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMACE113 ORGANISATION OVERVIEW AND PERFORMANCESustainable development performance Table 51: ACT Health operational consumption of resources Indicator as at 30 June UnitPrevious FY (2013-14)Current FY (2014-15)Percentage Change 6,195.4 3.59% Agency staff Headcount area Area (m2) 259,504 274,480 5.77% Stationary energy usage Electricity use Kilowatt hours 31,978,303136,399,242213.82% Renewable electricity use Kilowatt hours N/a N/a3- Natural gas use Megajoules 110,109,684 109,252,309 -0.77% usage Total number of 321 32140% Total kilometres travelled Kilometres 3,882,625 3,755,211 -3.28% Fuel use - Petrol Kilolitres 221 199 -9.95% Fuel use - Diesel Kilolitres 126 128 1.58% Fuel use - Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) Kilolitres - - - Fuel use - Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) Kilolitres - - - Water usage Water use Kilolitres 220,317.3 214,267.55-2.75% Resource efficiency and waste Reams of paper purchased Reams 48,781 49,48761.44% Recycled content of paper purchased Percentage 3.76 21.6 474.47% Waste to 976,396 1,117,613814.50% Organic material recycled Litres 4,91097,2621047.9% Greenhouse gas emissions Emissions from stationary energy use Tonnes CO2-e 40,958 36,19911-11.62% Emissions from transport Tonnes CO2-e 41,894.15 37,078.12 -11.49% 1 Canberra Hospital meter readings in the first five months of 2013-14 reading 4,680,842kWh, or 35 per cent, less than reported in 2012-13 due to electrical meter irregularity. 2 The increase in energy usage for 2014-15 is associated with activity and infrastructure growth across all of ACT Health, for example the Canberra Region Cancer Centre and Walk in Centres at Belconnen and Tuggeranong becoming operational. 3 Not being reported at Directorate level, only reported at Whole-of-Government level. 4 Figure for 2014-15 is inclusive of two electric vehicles. 5 Reduction due to completion of building construction at acute and non-acute sites plus introduction of water efficient measures, such as fittings and newer plant. 6 Figure reflects an increase of paper reams purchased associated with increased headcount/activity growth across all of Health. 7 2014-15 waste to landfill litres reflects an increase of 2,475,280 litres (11.63 per cent) when compared to 2013-14 due to increased activity and infrastructure growth. 8 In 2014-15, ACT Health increased paper and cardboard recycling by 141,217 litres (or 14.50 per cent) when compared to 2013-14. 9 Replaces incorrect 2013-14 figure of 8,012 litres (calculation error), which was to represent 11 Moore St outputs only, 4,910 litres includes eight months data for 1 Moore Street and 12 months data for 11 Moore Street. 10 7,262 litres for 2014-15 includes 12 months data for 1 Moore Street and 11 Moore Street. 11 ACT Health reduced its overall emissions across all scopes in 2014-15 against a 5.77 per cent increase in workplace floor area.ACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-15114FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT REPORTING SECTION C FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT REPORTING115 SECTION C Financial Management ReportingSECTION C - FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT REPORTING ACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-15116C.1 FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS FOR THE HEALTH DIRECTORATE FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2015 General Overview Operations and Principal Activities The Directorate partners with the community and consumers for better health outcomes by: delivering patient and family centred care; strengthening partnerships; promoting good health and wellbeing; improving access to appropriate healthcare; and having robust safety and quality systems. We aim for sustainability and improved efficiency in the use of resources, by designing sustainable services to deliver outcomes efficiently, and embedding a culture of research and innovation. The Directorate continues to strengthen clinical governance of its processes, and strives to be accountable to both the government and the community. The Directorate aims to support our people and strengthen teams, by helping staff to reach their potential, promoting a learning culture and providing high-level leadership. Changes in Administrative Structure On 15 December 2014, Administrative Arrangements 2014 (No 2) (Notifiable Instrument NI2014-654) came into effect. This instrument transferred the Public Health Protection and Regulation function from the Health Directorate to the Chief Minister, Treasury and Economic Development Directorate as part of the establishment of Access Canberra. Risk Management The Directorate's management has identified the following potential risks that may influence the future financial position of the Directorate: abnormal rates of staff separation; the cost of medical malpractice indemnity; ability to attract and retain health professionals; demands on replacing systems and equipment; and growth in demand for services. The Government and the Directorate have responded to these risks in a number of ways, including: implementation of strategies for the retention and recruitment of doctors, nurses, midwives and allied health professionals; strengthening our patient safety and clinical practice review framework; establishing the Medical School in cooperation with the Australian National University; enhancement of procurement processes to maximise benefits from contracting; a significant investment in infrastructure replacement and growth; and a significant investment in clinical systems and recording systems. The above risks are monitored regularly throughout the year.FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT REPORTING SECTION C FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT REPORTING117Financial Performance The following financial information is based on audited financial statements for 2013-14 and 2014-15, and the budget and forward estimates contained in the 2015-16 Health Directorate Budget Statements. Total Net Cost of Services Actual Budget Actual 338.1 374.7 Comparison to Budgeted Net Cost of Services The Directorate's net cost of services for 2014-15 of $297.2 million was $4.7 million or 1.5 per cent lower than the 2014-15 budget. A combination of factors resulted in higher than budgeted own source revenue ($11.3 million). The main higher revenue variations are: Other Gains ($5.5 million) - due to the derecognition of lease liabilities (receiving a gain in revenue from no longer recording a lease pay out amount to own the vehicle) due to the change in lease type for motor vehicles which has been reclassified from finance leases to operating leases. This revenue is offset by an expense amount in 'Other Expenses' of $5.3 million for the derecognition of the motor vehicle asset (an expense from no longer recording the vehicle as ACT Health's asset); User Charges ACT Government ($3.2 million) - largely due to receiving additional revenue from the ACT Local Hospital Network Directorate; and User Charges Non-ACT Government ($3.2 million) - largely due to more inpatient fees as a result of an increase in compensable and private patients and revenue related to Department of Veterans Affairs patients that was not accounted for until 2014-15. This higher than budgeted own source revenue was partially offset by higher than budgeted expenses ($6.6 million). The main higher expense variations are: Depreciation and Amortisation ($8.2 million) - due to the demolition of Building 15 at Canberra Hospital ($5.4 million) earlier than it's original useful life and higher computer amortisation costs ($8.0 million) for completed software projects that became operational during 2014-15, partially offset by delays in the completion of capital works projects that have been moved out to 2015-16 and 2016-17; Employee Expenses ($7.7 million) - largely due to an increase in the rate used to estimate the present value of long service leave from 103.5% to 104.2% ($2.9 million) and annual leave consumption being lower than anticipated ($3.3 million). An increase in overtime costs and penalties account for the remaining balance; Supplies and Services ($4.1 million) - largely due to charges for Blood Products ($8.9 million) classified as supplies and services but in the budget allocated to Other Expenses. Partially offset by: cost savings in medical and surgical supplies ($1.3 million); cost savings in staff development ($1.4 million); lower domestic services charges ($1.2 million); and utilities charges being lower than anticipated ($1.0 million). The higher than budgeted expenses were partially offset by lower than budgeted Grants and Purchased Services ($14.5 million) expense. The 2014-15 Budget for Grants and Purchased Services was higher than required and has been adjusted down in the 2015-16 Budget. Comparison to 2013-14 Net Cost of Services There was an 11.4 per cent increase in net cost of services or $30.5 million more when compared to the 2013-14 actual cost of $266.7 million. ACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-15118This increase in net cost of services was due to higher expenses ($79.4 million). The main increases in expenses are: Employee Expenses ($36.7 million) - largely due to: the impact of collective agreement pay rises; an increase in the rate used to estimate the present value of long service leave from 103.5% to 104.2%; the impact of pay rises on employee leave; leave earned exceeding leave taken; and an increase in the overall workforce to cover growth in services; Depreciation and Amortisation ($14.1 million) - the increase is largely due to: higher amortisation for computer software projects that became operational in 2014-15 ($8.0 million); and The demolition of Building 15 at Canberra Hospital in 2014-15 earlier than its original useful life; Supplies and Services ($13.2 million) - increased costs for: medical and surgical supplies ($4.5 million) due to inflation and growth in acute services, mental health services and cancer services; increased computer costs ($2.8 million); higher pharmaceuticals costs ($2.4 million) mainly due to inflation and an increase in the use of high cost drugs; higher cleaning and water and sewerage costs ($1.5 million) for the full year effect of the opening of new buildings; and ageing assets increasing repairs and maintenance costs ($1.2 million); Other Expenses ($6.4 million) - largely due to the derecognition of motor vehicle assets ($5.3 million) following a change of lease type from finance to operating leases; Grants and Purchased Services ($5.7 million) - largely due to providing a dedicated hip and knee joint replacement program at Calvary John James Hospital which increased elective surgery payments by $3.6 million and an increase in payments to Calvary Public Hospital ($1.0 million) mainly for inflation and growth in services; and Superannuation ($4.6 million) - largely due to pay rises under collective agreements and an increase in the number of employees. Total expenditure was partially offset by reduced expenditure for Cost of Goods Sold ($1.0 million) due to a lower volume of goods being sold to private hospitals. Total Own Source Revenue increased by $48.9 million largely due to higher: ACT Government User Charges ($42.6 million) largely due to indexation and growth in patient activity; and Other Gains ($5.7 million) largely from the derecognition of lease liability for motor vehicles due to a change from finance leases to operating leases. Future Trends Figure 1: Net Cost of Budget Forward Forward Forward Estimate Estimate Estimate $m Total Expenditure Total Own Source Revenue Net Cost of Services Figure 1: Net Cost of ServicesFINANCIAL MANAGEMENT REPORTING SECTION C FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT REPORTING119Net cost of services is planned to increase steadily over the future years consistent with funding provided in the 2015-16 Budget and the forward estimate years for growth in public health services including acute services, critical care, cancer services, rehabilitation, aged and community services and mental health services. Total Expenditure Components of Expenditure Figure 2 below indicates the components of the Directorate's expenses for 2014-15 with the largest components of expense being employee expenses which represents 53.8 per cent or $643.1 million, supplies and services which represents 27.1 per cent or $323.9 million, and superannuation, which represents 6.8 per cent or $81.0 million. Figure 2: Components of Expenditure Comparison to Budget Total expenses of $1,195.3 million were $6.6 million, or 0.6 per cent higher than the original 2014-15 budget of $1,188.7 million. This increase was predominantly due to higher: Depreciation and Amortisation ($8.2 million) - due to the demolition of Building 15 at Canberra Hospital ($5.4 million) earlier than its original useful life and higher amortisation costs for completed computer software projects that became operational during 2014-15 ($8.0 million), offset by delays in the completion of capital works projects that have been moved out to 2015-16 and 2016-17; Employee Expenses ($7.7 million) - largely due to an increase in the rate used to estimate the present value of long service leave from 103.5% to 104.2% ($2.9 million) and annual leave consumption being lower than anticipated ($3.3 million). An increase in staff numbers, increased overtime costs and penalties account for the balance; Supplies and Services ($4.1 million) - largely due to: the use of visiting medical officers (VMO's) to backfill staff specialist vacancies and staff specialists on extended leave ($3.1 million); increased amounts of assets purchased under the capitalisation threshold of $5,000 ($1.7 million); and the hiring of non-contract staff ($1.9 million); These higher supplies and services were partially offset by: \u2014cost savings in medical and surgical supplies ($1.3 million); \u2014cost savings in staff development services charges ($1.2 million); and lower than anticipated ($1.0 million); and Superannuation ($1.4 million) - largely due to; pay rise impacts; an increasing workforce; and a slower decline in the number of employees leaving the higher cost CSS, PSS and PSSap schemes than had been anticipated.Superannuation 6.8% Employee Expense 53.8%Supplies and Services 27.1% Depreciation and Amortisation 3.9% Grants and Purchased Services 6.6% Other Expenses 1.8%ACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-15120This higher expenditure was partially offset by lower Grants and Purchased Services ($14.5 million) expense. The 2014-15 Budget for Grants and Purchased Services was higher than required and has been adjusted down in the 2015-16 Budget. Comparison to 2013-14 Actual Expenses Total expenses were ($79.4 million) or 7.1 per cent higher than the 2013-14 actual result. The increase was predominantly due to higher: Employee Expenses ($36.7 million) - largely due to: the impact of collective agreement pay rises; an increase in the rate used to estimate the present value of long service leave from 103.5% to 104.2%; the impact of pay rises on employee leave; leave earned exceeding leave taken; and an increase in the overall workforce to cover growth in services; Depreciation and Amortisation ($14.1 million) - the increase is due to: higher amortisation for computer software projects that became operational in 2014-15 ($8.0 million); and The demolition of Building 15 at Canberra Hospital in 2014-15 before the end of its original useful life ($5.4 million); Supplies and Services ($13.2 million) - the main variations are due to increased: clinical expenses/medical surgical supplies ($4.5 million) - mainly due to inflation and growth in patient activity; computer expenses ($4.5 million) - due to a combination of factors, including inflation, increase in staff numbers and support costs for projects that became operational during the year; pharmaceuticals ($2.4 million) - mainly due to inflation and an increase in the use of high cost drugs; domestic services, food and utilities ($1.5 million) - mainly due to higher cleaning and water and sewerage costs for the full year effect of the opening of new buildings; repairs and maintenance ($1.2 million) - as a result of preventative and reactive repairs on ageing assets and an increase in maintenance costs for new buildings; and the higher supplies and services were partially offset by lower visiting medical officers (VMO's) ($1.8 million) - as a result of higher expenses in 2013-14 that included costs for services provided in 2012-13 that had previously not been accounted for; Other Expenses ($6.4 million) - due to: the derecognition of motor vehicle assets ($5.3 million) following a change of lease type from finance to operating leases; the write off of audio visual communication equipment ($1.8 million) that was bought for hospitals throughout Southern New South Wales; and the higher other expenses were offset by a reduction in legal settlements ($1.1 million); Grants and Purchased Services ($5.7 million) - largely due to providing a dedicated hip and knee joint replacement program at Calvary John James which increased elective surgery payments by $3.6 million, an increase in payments to Calvary Public Hospital ($1.0 million) which was largely related to inflation and growth and the balance relates to inflation on contracts with non-government organisations; and Superannuation ($4.6 million) - as a result of an increase in: the number of employees; pay rises under collective agreements; increase in notional superannuation rates; and a slower decline in the number of employees leaving the higher cost CSS, PSS and PSSap schemes than had been anticipated. The increased expenses were partially offset by lower Cost of Goods Sold ($1.0 million) - due to a lower volume of goods being sold to private hospitals.FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT REPORTING SECTION C FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT REPORTING121Future Trends Expenses are budgeted to increase steadily across the forward years to account for inflation and growth in services. Total Own Source Revenue Components of Own Source Revenue Figure 3 below indicates that for the financial year ended 30 June 2015, the Directorate received 85.4 per cent of its total own source revenue ($3.2 million) from ACT Government user charges. User Changes - ACT Government 85.4%User Charges - Non-ACT Government 12.2%Other Revenue 2.2% Resources Received Free of Charge 0.2% Figure 3 - Components of Own Source Revenue Comparison to Budget Own source revenue for the year ending 30 June 2015 was $898.1 million, which was $11.3 million or 1.3 per cent higher than the 2014-15 budget of $886.8 million. This favourable variance is due to higher: Other Gains ($5.5 million) - due to the derecognition of lease liabilities from the change in lease type for motor vehicles which moved from finance leases to operating leases; User Charges ACT Government ($3.2 million) - due to receiving additional revenue from the ACT Local Hospital Network Directorate; and User Charges Non-ACT Government ($3.2 million) - largely due to increased inpatient fees from an increase in compensable and private patients and prior year revenues related to Department of Veterans Affairs patients. Comparison to 2013-14 Actual Revenue Own source revenue was $48.9 million or 5.8 per cent higher than the 2013-14 actual result of $849.2 million. The increase compared to last financial year is due to: ACT Government User Charges ($42.6 million) largely due to inflation and growth in patient activity; Other Gains ($5.7 million) - mainly due to the derecognition of lease liabilities (receiving a gain in revenue from no longer recording a lease payout amount to own the vehicle) due to the change in lease type for motor vehicles which has been reclassified from finance leases to operating leases; and Non-ACT Government User Charges ($1.6 million) - largely due to an increase in inpatient fees as a result of increases in compensable and private patients as well as prior year revenues related to the Department of Veterans Affairs patients.ACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-15122Future Trends Total own source revenue is expected to increase steadily across the forward years consistent with funding provided to the ACT Local Hospital Network to purchase increased activity from the Canberra Hospital and Health Services in 2015-16 and the forward estimate years. Financial Position Total Assets Components of Total Assets Figure 4 below indicates that, for the financial year ended 30 June 2015, the Directorate held 74.6 per cent of its assets in property, plant and equipment.

The variance reflects the timing associated with the acquisition and completion of various assets over the 2014-15 financial year resulting in lower: Property, Plant and Equipment ($129.2 million) - largely due to delays with current capital works projects from lengthy contract negotiations, procurement delays and extensions, delays in hospital road works as a result of the installation of a new demountable building, and a flow on effect of delays between projects; Receivables ($46.2 million) - largely due to the budget including a large amount for cross border revenue which has since been received; Intangible Assets ($7.8 million) - largely due to delays with computer software projects; and Capital Works in Progress ($1.5 million) - due to the deferral of capital works from 2014-15 into future years, partially offset by the deferral of 2013-14 capital works projects into 2014-15. Partially offset by higher: Cash and Cash Equivalents ($63.0 million) - largely due to payment of the 27th pay happening on 1 July 2015 rather than 30 June 2015 and continued delay in the medical officers enterprise bargaining agreement.FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT REPORTING SECTION C FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT REPORTING123Comparison to 2013-14 Actual The Directorate's total asset position is $29.6 million higher than the 2013-14 actual result of $1,158.8 million, largely due to increases in: Property, Plant and Equipment ($27.0 million) - largely due to completed building capital works projects; and Intangible Assets ($15.7 million) - due to completed computer software packages; and Receivables ($3.8 million) - the increase mainly relates to reimbursements of Directorate doctors seconded to Calvary Hospital and accrued revenue for chargeable patients fees. The above increases were partially offset by a reduction in: Capital Works in Progress ($16.0 million) - as a result of completed computer software works moving to intangible assets and completed building works moving to property, plant and equipment; and Cash and Cash Equivalents ($2.2 million) - The reduction in cash relates to the return of $27 million surplus cash to the ACT Government, this is offset by cash held by the Directorate for a 27th pay that occurs in 2015-16, outstanding pay rise back pay for medical officers and deferred expenditure. Total Liabilities Components of Total Liabilities Figure 5 below indicates that the majority of the Directorate's liabilities relate to employee benefits 81.3 per cent and payables 18.1 per cent. Employee Benefits 81.3%Payables 18.1% Other Liabilities 0.6% Figure 5 - Total Liabilities as at 30 June 2015 Comparison to Budget The Directorate's liabilities for the year ended 30 June 2015, of $300.1 million, is $1.9 million lower than the 2014-15 budget of $302.0 million. This was largely due to higher: Employee Benefits ($41.2 million) - largely due to the impact of pay rises on leave provisions, increases in the rates used to estimate the present value of long service leave from 103.5% to 104.2% and annual leave from 100.9% to 101.0%. Offset by lower: Payables ($33.9 million) - largely due to the budget including a large amount for unpaid capital works invoices which was reduced in 2014-15; Finance Leases ($6.9 million) - this relates to motor vehicle finance leases and on 23 April 2015 there was a change in contract at the Whole-of-Government level to move these to operating leases leaving a nil actual figure; and Other Liabilities ($2.3 million) - largely due to the budget including a large amount for revenue received in advance which was based on actual figures from 2012-13.ACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-15124Comparison to 2013-14 Actual Total liabilities of $300.1 million are $27.3 million higher than the actual results as at 30 June 2014 of $272.8 million. This is due to increases in: Employee Benefits ($22.0 million) - largely due to the impact of pay rises on leave provisions, accrued pay rise amounts for medical officers, increases in the rates used to estimate the present value of long service leave from 103.5% to 104.2% and annual leave from 100.9% to 101.0%; Payables ($11.6 million) - the increase includes capital works accruals ($7.0 million), visiting medical officer accruals ($2.0 million) and pharmaceutical accruals ($2.0 million); and The above increases were partially offset by a decrease in: Finance Leases ($6.2 million) - this relates to motor vehicle finance leases and on 23 April 2015 there was a change in contract lease type from finance to operating leases.FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT REPORTING SECTION C FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT REPORTING125Attachment A - Comparison of net cost of services to budget 2014-15 Original Plus AAO Total Less Variance to be Explained Budget Transfers Funding Actual Description $'000 $'000 $'000 $'000 $'000 863,162 866,105 2,943 0.3% Interest 278 - 278 70 (208) -74.8% Resources Received Free of Charge 792 - 792 85.6% 297,248 (4,346) -1.4%ACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-15126Territorial Statement of Revenue and Expenses The activities whose funds flow through the Directorate's Territorial accounts are: The receipt of regulatory licence fees; and The receipt and on-passing of monies for capital works at Calvary Public Hospital.

Total Territorial income for 2014-15 of $8.0 million is $2.2 million higher than the 2013-14 income of $5.8 million. The main contributor to this increase is: Payment for Expenses on Behalf of the Territory ($2.1 million) - this is due to capital works paid to Calvary Public Hospital.FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT REPORTING SECTION C FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT REPORTING127Total Expenses Figure 7 below indicates that 84.1 per cent of expenses incurred on behalf of the Territory relate to the on-passing of monies for capital works to Calvary Public Hospital, with the other 15.9 per cent being the transfer, to Government, of regulatory licence fees. Grants and Purchased Services 84.1%Transfer to Government 15.9% Figure 7 - Sources of Territorial Expenses Total expenses were $8.0 million, which was $0.9 million lower than the budget of $8.9 million due to lower regulatory licence fees received.

Column Heading Explanations The Original Budget column shows the amounts that appear in the Cash Flow Statement in the Budget Papers. This amount also appears in the Cash Flow Statement. The Total Appropriated column is inclusive of all appropriation variations occurring after the Original Budget. The Appropriation Drawn is the total amount of appropriation received by the Directorate during the year. This amount appears in the Cash Flow Statement. Variances between 'Original Budget' and 'Total Appropriated' Government Payment for Outputs The difference between the Original Budget and Total Appropriated is due to Enterprise Bargaining Agreement funding for pay rises ($2.924 million) and revised Commonwealth funding for the Breastscreen Australia ($0.521 million) and Essential Vaccines ($0.425 million) National Partnership Agreements offset by the transfer of the Public Health Protection and Regulation Function ($0.382 million) in December 2014 to the Chief Minister, Treasury and Economic Development Directorate. Capital Injections The difference between the Original Budget and Total Appropriated in 2014-15 is due to the transfer of appropriation ($15.452) million from 2013-14. The transfer ensures the balance of the appropriation for each capital project is available to complete the approved work. Variances between 'Total Appropriated' and 'Appropriation Drawn' Government Payment for Outputs The difference between the Total Appropriated and Appropriation Drawn is mainly due to: the deferral of funding to align revenue with the latest planned timing of delivery of services; and a reduction in appropriation drawdown by the Directorate to offset additional funding received from the ACT Local Hospital Network Directorate associated with Commonwealth funding for the 'Public Hospital System - Additional Funding National Partnership Agreement' ($4.373 million). Capital Injections The difference between the Total Appropriated and Appropriation Drawn in 2014-15 is due to the deferral of capital works projects from 2014-15 to 2015-16 and 2016-17. The major deferrals from 2014-15 into future years are: $10.2 million moved out of this financial year for the Calvary Car Park due to delays in excavation works as a result of large volumes of unexpected unsuitable material found on site; $9.6 million moved out of this financial year due to postponement of works on Hospital Road at the Canberra Hospital as a result of road closures associated with Building 15 demountable installation; $8.0 million moved out of this financial year for the E-Health ICT project due to lengthy delays in contract negotiations in relation to the Electronic Medication Management and Clinical Records Information System Replacement Projects; and $7.4 million moved out of this financial year from the clinical services redevelopment - phase 3 project due to delays with procurement of generators and a flow on effect of delays with other construction works.ACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-15138HEALTH DIRECTORATE CONTROLLED NOTE INDEX FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2015 Note 1 Objectives of the Health Directorate Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Note 3 Change in Accounting Policy and Accounting Estimates, and Correction of Prior Period Errors Income Notes Note 4 Government Payment for Outputs Note 5 User Charges Note 6 Interest Note 7 Distribution from Investments with the Territory Banking Account Note 8 Resources Received Free of Charge Note 9 Other Revenue Note 10 Gains on Investment Note 11 Other Gains Expense Notes Note 12 Employee Expenses Note 13 Superannuation Expenses Note 14 Supplies and Services Note 15 Depreciation and Amortisation Note 16 Grants and Purchased Services Note 17 Borrowing Costs Note 18 Cost of Goods Sold Note 19 Other Expenses Note 20 Waivers, Impairment Losses and Write-Offs Note 21 Auditor's Remuneration Note 22 Act of Grace Payments Asset Notes Note 23 Cash and Cash Equivalents Note 24 Receivables Note 25 Inventories Note 26 Assets Held for Sale Note 27 Investments Note 28 Property, Plant and Equipment Note 29 Intangible Assets Note 30 Capital Works in Progress Note 31 Other Assets Liability Notes Note 32 Payables Note 33 Finance Leases Note 34 Employee Benefits Note 35 Other Provisions Note 36 Other Liabilities Equity Note Note 37 Equity Other Notes Note 38 Restructure of Administrative Arrangements Note 39 Financial Instruments Note 40 Commitments Note 41 Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets Note 42 Cash Flow Reconciliation Note 43 Events Occurring after Balance Date Note 44 Third Party Monies Note 45 Budgetary ReportingFINANCIAL MANAGEMENT REPORTINGHealth Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2015 SECTION C FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT REPORTING139Note 1.

The FMA and the Financial Management Guidelines issued under the Act, requires the Health Directorate's (the Directorate) financial statements to include: i) an Operating Statement for the year; ii) a Balance Sheet at the end of the year; iii) a Statement of Changes in Equity for the year; iv) a Cash Flow Statement for the year; v) a Statement of Appropriation for the year; vi) an Operating Statement for each class of output for the year; vii) a summary of the significant accounting policies adopted for the year; and viii) such other statements as are necessary to fairly reflect the financial operations of the Directorate during the year and its financial position at the end of the year. These general-purpose financial statements have been prepared to comply with 'Generally Accepted Accounting Principles' (GAAP) as required by the FMA. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with: i) Australian Accounting Standards; and ii) ACT Accounting and Disclosure Policies. As at 30 June 2015, the Directorate's current liabilities ($284.1 million) exceed current assets ($144.9 million) by $139.2 million. However, this is not considered to be a liquidity risk as its cash needs are funded through appropriation from the ACT Government on a cash-needs basis. This is consistent with the Whole-of- Government cash management regime, which requires excess cash balances to be held centrally rather than within individual Directorate bank accounts. The financial statements have been prepared using the accrual basis of accounting, which recognises the effects of transactions and events when they occur. The financial statements have also been prepared according to the historical cost convention, except for assets such as those included in assets held for sale, property, plant and equipment and financial instruments which were valued at fair value in accordance with the (re)valuation policies applicable to the Directorate during the reporting period. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is measured using the market approach, the cost approach or the income approach valuation techniques as appropriate. In estimating the fair value of an asset or liability, the Directorate takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at measurement date. FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT REPORTINGHealth Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2015 SECTION C FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT REPORTING141Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) (a) Basis of Preparation (Continued) The above approach to fair value measurement does not apply to leasing transactions within the scope of AASB 117 Leases or measurements that have some similarities to fair value but are not fair value, such as net realisable value in AASB 102 Inventories or value in use in AASB 136 Impairment of Assets . For disclosure purposes fair value measurements are categorised into Level 1, 2 or 3 based on the extent to which the inputs to the valuation techniques are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Fair Value Hierarchy is made up of the following three levels: Level 1 - quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Directorate can access at the measurement date; Level 2 - inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and Level 3 - inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs) that are unobservable for particular assets or liabilities. These financial statements are presented in Australian dollars, which is the Directorate's functional currency. The Directorate is an individual reporting entity. (b) Controlled and Territorial Items The Directorate produces Controlled and Territorial financial statements. The Controlled financial statements include income, expenses, assets and liabilities over which the Directorate has control. The Territorial financial statements include income, expenses, assets and liabilities that the Directorate administers on behalf of the ACT Government, but does not control. The purpose of the distinction between Controlled and Territorial is to enable an assessment of the Directorate's performance against the decisions it has made in relation to the resources it controls, while maintaining accountability for all resources under its responsibility. The basis of preparation described in Note 2(a) above applies to both Controlled and Territorial financial statements except where specified otherwise. (c) The Reporting Period These financial statements state the financial performance, changes in equity and cash flows of the Directorate for the year ending 30 June 2015 together with the financial position of the Directorate as at 30 June 2015. (d) Comparative Figures Budget Figures To facilitate a comparison with Budget Papers, as required by the Financial Management Act 1996 , budget information for 2014-15 has been presented in the financial statements. Budget numbers in the financial statements are the original budget numbers that appear in the Budget Papers.Health Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2015 ACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-15142Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) (d) Comparative Figures (Continued) Prior Year Comparatives Comparative information has been disclosed in respect of the previous period for amounts reported in the financial statements, except where an Australian Accounting Standard does not require comparative information to be disclosed. Where the presentation or classification of items in the financial statements is amended, the comparative amounts have been reclassified where practical. Where a reclassification has occurred, the nature, amount and reason for the reclassification is provided. (e) Rounding All amounts in the financial statements have been rounded to the nearest thousand dollars ($'000). Use of the \"-\" symbol represents zero amounts or amounts rounded up or down to zero. (f) Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable in the Operating Statement. All revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Directorate and the revenue can be reliably measured. In addition, the following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised: Government Payment for Outputs and Payment for Expenses on Behalf of the Territory Government Payment for Outputs and Payment for Expenses on Behalf of the Territory are recognised as revenues when the Directorate gains control over the funding. Control over appropriated funds is obtained upon the receipt of cash. ACT Government User Charges The Directorate receives funding from the Local Hospital Network Directorate (LHN). The funding received from the LHN by the Health Directorate is based on the historical costs of the Directorate adjusted for growth in services provided and inflation. Funding from the LHN is recognised as revenue when the Directorate gains control over the funding. Control over LHN funding is obtained upon the receipt of cash. Service Revenue Revenue from the rendering of services is recognised when the stage of completion of the transaction at the reporting date can be measured reliably and the costs of rendering those services can be measured reliably. Inventory Sales Revenue from inventory sales is recognised as revenue when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods has transferred to the buyer, the Directorate retains neither continuing managerial involvement nor effective control over the goods sold and the costs incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT REPORTINGHealth Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2015 SECTION C FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT REPORTING143Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) (f) Revenue Recognition (Continued) Amounts Received for Highly Specialised Drugs Revenue from the supply of highly specialised drugs is recognised as revenue when the drugs have been supplied to the patients. Inpatient Fees For the hospital treatment of chargeable patients, inpatient fees are recognised as revenue when the services have been provided. Revenue related to hospital services provided to the Department of Veterans Affairs patients is recognised when the number of patients and complexities of the treatments provided can be measured reliably and the contract price for such services is agreed with the Department of Veterans Affairs. Actual patient numbers and services are settled following an acquittal process undertaken in subsequent years and variations to the revenue recognised are accounted for in the year of settlement with the Department of Veterans Affairs. Facilities Fees Facilities fees are generated from the provision of facilities to enable specialists and senior specialists to exercise rights of private practice in the treatment of chargeable patients at a Health Directorate facility. They are recognised as revenue when the amount of revenue can be measured reliably. Distribution Distribution revenue is received from investments with the Territory Banking Account. This is recognised on an accrual basis . Grants Grants are non-reciprocal in nature and are recognised as revenue in the year in which the Directorate obtains control over them. Where grants are reciprocal in nature, the revenue is recognised over the term of the funding arrangements. Interest Interest revenue is recognised using the effective interest method. Revenue Received in Advance Revenue received in advance is recognised as a liability if there is a present obligation to return the funds received, otherwise all are recorded as revenue.Health Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2015 ACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-15144Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) (g) Resources Received and Provided Free of Charge Resources received free of charge are recorded as a revenue and expense in the Operating Statement at fair value. The revenue is separately disclosed under resources received free of charge, with the expense being recorded in the line item to which it relates. Goods and services received free of charge from ACT Government agencies are recorded as resources received free of charge, whereas goods and services received free of charge from entities external to the ACT Government are recorded as donations. Services that are received free of charge are only recorded in the Operating Statement if they can be reliably measured and would have been purchased if not provided to the Directorate free of charge. Resources provided free of charge are recorded at their fair value in the expense line items to which they relate. (h) Repairs and Maintenance The Directorate undertakes major cyclical maintenance on its assets. Where the maintenance leads to an upgrade of the asset, and increases the service potential of the existing asset, the cost is capitalised. Maintenance expenses which do not increase the service potential of the asset are expensed. (i) Borrowing Costs Borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. (j) Waivers of Debt Debts that are waived during the year under Section 131 of the Financial Management Act 1996 are expensed during the year in which the right to payment was waived. Further details of waivers are disclosed at Note 20: Waivers, Impairment Losses and Write-offs. (k) Current and Non-Current Items Assets and liabilities are classified as current or non-current in the Balance Sheet and in the relevant notes. Assets are classified as current where they are expected to be realised within 12 months after the reporting date. Liabilities are classified as current when they are due to be settled within 12 months after the reporting date or when the Directorate does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date. Assets or liabilities which do not fall within the current classification are classified as non-current.FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT REPORTINGHealth Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2015 SECTION C FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT REPORTING145Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) (l) Impairment of Assets The Directorate assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. Assets are also reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. However, intangible assets that are not yet available for use are tested annually for impairment regardless of whether there is an indication of impairment, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate they might be impaired. Any resulting impairment losses, for land, buildings, and leasehold improvements, are recognised as a decrease in the Asset Revaluation Surplus relating to these classes of assets. This is because these asset classes are measured at fair value and have an Asset Revaluation Surplus attached to them. Where the impairment loss is greater than the balance in the Asset Revaluation Surplus for the relevant class of asset, the difference is expensed in the Operating Statement. Impairment losses for plant and equipment and intangible assets are expensed in the Operating Statement, as plant and equipment and intangibles are carried at cost. Also, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is the amount by which the carrying amount of an asset (or a cash-generating unit) exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset's 'fair value less costs of disposal' and use' . An asset's 'value in use' is its depreciated replacement cost, where the asset would be replaced if the Directorate were deprived of it. Non-financial assets that have previously been impaired are reviewed for possible reversal of impairment at each reporting date. (m) Cash and Cash Equivalents For the purposes of the Cash Flow Statement and the Balance Sheet, cash includes cash at bank and cash on hand. Directorate money held in the Territory Banking Account Cash Fund is classified as a Cash Equivalent. Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. (n) Receivables Accounts receivable (including trade receivables and other trade receivables) are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, with any adjustments to the carrying amount being recorded in the Operating Statement. Trade receivables arise in the normal course of selling goods and services to other agencies and to the public. Trade receivables are payable within 30 days after the issue of an invoice or the goods/services have been provided under a contractual arrangement. In some cases, the Directorate has entered into contractual arrangements with some customers allowing it to charge interest at commercial rates where payment is not received within 90 days after the amount falls due, until the whole of the debt is paid.Health Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2015 ACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-15146Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) (n) Receivables (Continued) Other trade receivables arise outside the normal course of selling goods and services to other agencies and to the public. Other trade receivables are payable within 30 days after the issue of an invoice or the goods/ services have been provided under a contractual arrangement. If payment has not been received within 90 days after the amount falls due, under the terms and conditions of the arrangement with the debtor, the Directorate is able to charge interest at commercial rates until the whole amount of the debt is paid. The allowance for impairment losses represents the amount of trade receivables and other trade receivables the Directorate estimates will not be repaid. The allowance for impairment losses is based on objective evidence and a review of overdue balances. The Directorate considers the following is objective evidence of impairment: becoming aware of financial difficulties of debtors; default payments; or debts more than 90 days overdue. The amount of the allowance is the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. Cash flows relating to shortterm receivables are not discounted if the effect of discounting is immaterial. The amount of the allowance is recognised in the Operating Statement. The allowance for impairment losses is written off against the allowance account when the Directorate ceases action to collect the debt as it considers that it will cost more to recover the debt than the debt is worth. Receivables that have been renegotiated because they are past due or impaired are accounted for based on the renegotiated terms. (o) Investments The Directorate holds one long-term investment. It is held with the Territory Banking Account in a unit trust called the Cash Enhanced Fund. Investments are measured at fair value with any adjustments to the carrying amount recorded in the Operating Statement. Fair value is based on an underlying pool of investments which have quoted market prices as at the reporting date. (p) Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises the purchase price of inventories as well as transport, handling and other costs directly attributable to the acquisition of inventories. Trade discounts, rebates and similar items are deducted in determining the costs of purchase. The cost of inventories is assigned using the cost weighted average method. Net realisable value is determined using the estimated sales proceeds less costs incurred in marketing, selling and distribution to customers.FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT REPORTINGHealth Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2015 SECTION C FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT REPORTING147Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) (q) Assets Held for Sale Assets held for sale are assets that are available for immediate sale in their present condition, and their sale is highly probable. Assets held for sale are measured at the lower of the carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. An impairment loss is recognised for any initial or subsequent write down of the asset to fair value less cost to sell. Assets held for sale are not depreciated. (r) Acquisition and Recognition of Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment is initially recorded at cost. Cost includes the purchase price, directly attributable costs and the estimated cost of dismantling and removing the item (where, upon acquisition, there is a present obligation to remove the item). Where property, plant and equipment is acquired at no cost, or minimal cost, cost is its fair value as at the date of acquisition. However property, plant and equipment acquired at no cost or minimal cost as part of a Restructuring of Administrative Arrangements is measured at the transferor's book value. Where payment for property, plant and equipment is deferred beyond normal credit terms, the difference between its cash price equivalent and the total payment is measured as interest over the period of credit. The discount rate used to calculate the cash price equivalent is an asset specific rate. Property, plant and equipment with a minimum value of $5,000 is capitalised. (s) Measurement of Property, Plant and Equipment after Initial Recognition Property, plant and equipment is valued using the cost or revaluation model of valuation. Land, buildings and leasehold improvements are measured at fair value. The Directorate measures its plant and equipment at cost. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value for land and non-specialised buildings is measured using the market approach valuation technique. This approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or similar assets. Fair value for specialised buildings and leasehold improvements is measured by reference to the cost of replacing the remaining future economic benefits embodied in the asset (i.e depreciated replacement cost). This is the cost approach valuation technique. Depreciated replacement cost is the current replacement cost of an asset less accumulated depreciation calculated on the basis of such cost to reflect the already consumed economic benefits, expired economic benefits or obsolescence of the asset. Current replacement cost is determined by reference to the cost of a substitute asset of comparable utility, the gross project size specifications or the historical cost, adjusted by relevant indices. Land, buildings and leasehold improvements are revalued every 3 years. However, if at any time management considers that the carrying amount of an asset materially differs from its fair value, then the asset will be revalued regardless of when the last valuation took place. Any accumulated depreciation relating to buildings and leasehold improvements at the date of revaluation is written-back against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the net amount is restated to the revalued amount of the asset. The cost of plant and equipment comprises the purchase price, any directly attributable costs, and the initial estimate of the cost of dismantling and removing the plant and equipment and restoring the site on which it is located.Health Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2015 ACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-15148Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) (t) Intangible Assets The Directorate's intangible assets comprise internally developed and externally acquired software for internal use. Externally acquired software is recognised and capitalised when: a) it is probable that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to the software will flow to the Directorate; b) the cost of the software can be measured reliably; and c) the acquisition cost is equal to or exceeds $50,000. Internally generated software is recognised when it meets the general recognition criteria outlined above and where it also meets the specific recognition criteria relating to internally developed intangible assets. Capitalised software has a finite useful life. Software is amortised on a straight-line basis over its useful life, over a period not exceeding 5 years. Intangible assets are measured at cost. (u) Depreciation and Amortisation of Non-Current Assets Non-current assets with a limited useful life are subject to systematic depreciation/amortisation over their useful lives in a manner that reflects the consumption of their service potential. The useful life commences when an asset is ready for use. When an asset is revalued, it is subject to depreciation/amortisation over its newly assessed remaining useful life. Amortisation is used in relation to intangible assets while depreciation is applied to physical assets such as buildings and plant and equipment. Land has an unlimited useful life and is therefore not depreciated. Leasehold improvements and motor vehicles under a finance lease are depreciated over the estimated useful life of each asset improvement, or the unexpired period of the relevant lease, whichever is shorter. All depreciation is calculated after first deducting any residual values which remain for each asset. Depreciation/amortisation for non-current assets is determined as follows. Class of Asset Depreciation/Amortisation Method Useful Life (Years) Buildings Straight Line 40-80 Leasehold Improvements Straight Line 2-10 Plant and Equipment Straight Line 2-20 Externally Purchased Intangibles Straight Line 2-5 Internally Generated Intangibles Straight Line 2-5 Land improvements are included with buildings. The useful lives of all major assets held are reassessed on an annual basis.FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT REPORTINGHealth Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2015 SECTION C FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT REPORTING149Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) (v) Payables Payables are a financial liability and are initially recognised at fair value based on the transaction cost and subsequent to initial recognition at amortised cost, with any adjustments to the carrying amount being recorded in the Operating Statement. All amounts are normally settled within 30 days after the invoice date. Payables include Trade Payables, Accrued Expenses and Other Payables. Trade Payables represent the amounts owing for goods and services received prior to the end of the reporting period and unpaid at the end of the reporting period and relating to the normal operations of the Directorate. Accrued Expenses represent goods and services provided by other parties during the period that are unpaid at the end of the reporting period and where an invoice has not been received by period end. Other Payables are those unpaid invoices that do not directly relate to the normal operations of the Directorate. (w) Leases The Directorate has entered into finance leases and operating leases. Finance Leases Finance leases effectively transfer to the Directorate substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the assets under a finance lease. The title may or may not eventually be transferred. Finance leases are initially recognised as an asset and a liability at the lower of the fair value of the asset (AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement definition of fair value does not apply - see AASB 117.6A) and the present value of the minimum lease payments each being determined at the inception of the lease. The discount rate used to calculate the present value of the minimum lease payments is the interest rate implicit in the lease. Assets under a finance lease are depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life or lease term. Assets under a finance lease are depreciated on a straight-line basis. Each lease payment is allocated between interest expense and reduction of the lease liability. Lease liabilities are classified as current and non-current. Operating Leases Operating leases do not effectively transfer to the Directorate substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the asset under an operating lease. Operating lease payments are recorded as an expense in the Operating Statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Motor Vehicle Leasing Arrangements 2014-15 Changes were made to the whole-of-government motor vehicle leasing arrangements with SG Fleet as a result of which all such leases were classified as operating leases rather than finance leases from 23 April 2015. The leased vehicles held as Property, Plant and Equipment (under the previous finance lease arrangement with SG Fleet) were derecognised and the associated loss on the derecognition of the leased vehicle assets reflected under Other Expenses (refer to Note 19: Other Expenses). The corresponding finance lease liability (current and non-current) was also derecognised and the associated gain from the derecognition of the liability reflected under Other Gains (refer to Note 11: Other Gains). Accordingly, gross amounts for the loss on the derecognition of the leased vehicles and the gain on the derecognition of the finance lease liability have been reported separately rather than on a net basis, in these financial statements. Health Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2015 ACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-15150Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) (x) Employee Benefits Employee benefits include: Short-term employee benefits such as wages and salaries, annual leave loading, and applicable on-costs, if expected to be settled wholly before twelve months after the end of the annual reporting period in which the employees render the related services; Other long-term benefits such as long service leave and annual leave; and Termination benefits. Oncosts include annual leave, long service leave, superannuation and other costs that are incurred when employees take annual and long service leave. Wages and Salaries Accrued wages and salaries are measured at the amount that remains unpaid to employees at the end of the reporting period. Annual and Long Service Leave Annual and long service leave including applicable on-costs that are not expected to be wholly settled before twelve months after the end of the reporting period when the employees render the related service are measured at the present value of estimated future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the end of the reporting period. Consideration is given to the future wage and salary levels, experience of employee departures and periods of service. At the end of each reporting period, the present value of future annual leave and long service leave payments is estimated using market yields on Commonwealth Government bonds with terms to maturity that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash flows. Annual leave liabilities have been estimated on the assumption that they will be wholly settled within three years. In 2014-15 the rate used to estimate the present value of future payments for annual leave is 101.0% (100.9% in 2013-14). In 2014-15, the rate used to estimate the present value of future payments for long service leave is 104.2% (103.5% in 2013-14). The long service leave liability is estimated with reference to the minimum period of qualifying service. For employees with less than the required minimum period of 7 years of qualifying service, the probability that employees will reach the required minimum period has been taken into account in estimating the provision for long service leave and applicable on-costs. The provision for annual leave and long service leave includes estimated on-costs. As these on-costs only become payable if the employee takes annual and long service leave while in-service, the probability that employees will take annual and long service leave while in service has been taken into account in estimating the liability for on-costs. The significant judgements and assumptions included in the estimation of annual and long service leave liabilities are determined by an actuary. The Australian Government Actuary performed this assessment in May 2014. The assessment by an actuary is performed every 5 years. However, it may be performed more frequently if there is a significant contextual change in the parameters underlying the 2014 report. The next actuarial review is expected to be undertaken by May 2019. Further information about this estimate is provided in Note 2(ad): Significant Accounting Judgements and Estimates. Annual leave and long service leave liabilities are classified as current liabilities in the Balance Sheet where there are no unconditional rights to defer the settlement of the liability for at least 12 months. Conditional long service leave liabilities are classified as non-current because the Directorate has an unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability until the employee has completed the requisite years of service.FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT REPORTINGHealth Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2015 SECTION C FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT REPORTING151Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) (y) Superannuation The Directorate receives funding for superannuation payments as part of the Government Payment for Outputs. The Directorate then makes payments on a fortnightly basis to the Territory Banking Account, to cover the Directorate's superannuation liability for the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme (CSS) and the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme (PSS). This payment covers the CSS/PSS employer contribution, but does not include the productivity component. The productivity component is paid directly to Comsuper by the Directorate. The CSS and PSS are defined benefit superannuation plans meaning that the defined benefits received by employees are based on the employee's years of service and average final salary. Superannuation payments have also been made directly to superannuation funds for those members of the Public Sector who are part of superannuation accumulation schemes. This includes the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme Accumulation Plan (PSSAP) and schemes of employee choice. Superannuation employer contribution payments, for the CSS and PSS, are calculated, by taking the salary level at an employee's anniversary date and multiplying it by the actuarially assessed nominal CSS or PSS employer contribution rate for each employee. The productivity component payments are calculated by taking the salary level, at an employee's anniversary date, and multiplying it by the employer contribution rate (approximately 3%) for each employee. Superannuation payments for the PSSAP are calculated by taking the salary level, at an employee's anniversary date, and multiplying it by the appropriate employer contribution rate. Superannuation payments for fund of choice arrangements are calculated by taking an employee's salary each pay and multiplying it by the appropriate employer contribution rate. The total Territory superannuation liability for the CSS, PSS, and Comsuper is recognised in the Chief Minister, Treasury and Economic Development Directorate's Superannuation Provision Account and the external schemes recognise the superannuation liability for the PSSAP and other schemes respectively. This superannuation liability is not recognised at individual agency level. The ACT Government is liable for the reimbursement of the emerging costs of benefits paid each year to members of the CSS and PSS in respect of the ACT Government service provided after 1 July 1989. These reimbursement payments are made from the Superannuation Provision Account. (z) Equity Contributed by the ACT Government Contributions made by the ACT Government, through its role as owner of the Directorate, are treated as contributions of equity. Increases or decreases in net assets as a result of Administrative Restructures are also recognised in equity. (aa) Insurance Major risks are insured through the ACT Insurance Authority. The excess payable, under this arrangement, varies depending on each class of insurance held. (ab) Third Party Monies The Directorate holds third party monies in a trustee capacity for the Health Directorate Human Research Ethics Committee and for residents of its Mental Health facilities. The Directorate also holds third party monies in an administrative capacity which is principally derived from patients treated by salaried specialists. Third party transactions are excluded from the Directorate's financial statements. Details of third party monies are shown at Note 44: Third Party Monies.Health Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2015 ACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-15152Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) (ac) Budgetary Reporting Explanations of major variances between the 2014-15 original budget and the 30 June 2015 actual results are discussed in Notes 45 (Controlled) and 59 (Territorial): Budgetary Reporting. The definition of 'major variances' is provided in Note 2(ad): Significant Accounting Judgements and Estimates - Budgetary Reporting. Original budget refers to the original budgeted financial statements presented to the Legislative Assembly in a form that is consistent with the Directorate's annual financial statements. The 2014-15 budget numbers have not been audited. Budgetary reporting is disclosed for both controlled and territorial financial statements with the exception of Statement of Changes in Equity as relevant line items are included in other financial statements. (ad) Significant Accounting Judgements and Estimates In the process of applying the accounting policies listed in this note, the Directorate has made the following judgements and estimates that have the most significant impact on the amounts recorded in the financial statements: a) Fair Value of Assets: the Directorate has made a significant estimate regarding the fair value of its assets. Land and Leasehold Improvements have been recorded at market value of similar properties as determined by an independent valuer. Buildings have been recorded at fair value based on a depreciated replacement cost as determined by an independent valuer. This valuation is determined by reference to the new cost of the buildings less depreciation for their physical, functional and economic obsolescence. b) Employee Benefits: significant judgements have been applied in estimating the liability for employee benefits. The estimated liability for annual and long service leave requires a consideration of the future wages and salary levels, experience of employee departures, probability that leave will be taken in service and periods of service. The estimate also includes an assessment of the probability that employees will meet the minimum service period required to qualify for long service leave and that oncosts will become payable. Further information on this estimate is provided in Note 2 (x): Employee Benefits . c) Depreciation and Amortisation: the Directorate has made a significant estimate in the lengths of useful lives over which its assets are depreciated and amortised. This estimation is the period in which utility will be gained from the use of the asset, based on either estimates from officers of the Directorate or an independent valuer. d) Contingent Liabilities: contingent liabilities are an estimate provided by the ACT Government Solicitor of the likely liability for legal claims against the Directorate.FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT REPORTINGHealth Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2015 SECTION C FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT REPORTING153Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) (ad) Significant Accounting Judgements and Estimates (Continued) e) Budgetary Reporting: Significant judgements have been applied in determining what variances are considered as 'major variances' requiring explanations in Notes 45 (Controlled) and 59 (Territorial): Budgetary Reporting. Variances are considered to be major variances if both of the following criteria are met: The line item is a significant line item: the line item actual amount accounts for more than 10% of the relevant associated category (Income, Expenses and Equity totals) or sub-element (e.g. Current Liabilities and Receipts from Operating Activities totals) of the financial statements; and The variances (original budget to actual) are greater than plus (+) or minus (-) 10% for the budget for the financial statement line item. Further information on this is provided in Note 2(ac): Budgetary Reporting. (ae) Impact of Accounting Standards Issued but yet to be Applied The following new and revised accounting standards and interpretations have been issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board but do not apply to the current reporting period. These standards and interpretations are applicable to future reporting periods. The Directorate does not intend to adopt these standards and interpretations early. Where applicable, these Australian Accounting Standards will be adopted from their application date. AASB 9 Financial Instruments (December 2014) (application date 1 January 2018); This standard supersedes AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. The main impact of AASB 9 is that it will change the classification, measurement and disclosure of financial assets. No material financial impact on the Directorate is expected. AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (application date 1 January 2017); AASB 15 is the new standard for revenue recognition. It establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when revenue is recognised. It replaces AASB 111 Construction Contracts and AASB 118 Revenue. The Directorate has assessed the impact of this standard and has identified there could be a potential impact on the timing of the recognition of revenue for user charges. This impact is not expected to be material. Health Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2015 ACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-15154Note 3.

This revenue is now collected through the ACT Local Health Network Directorate. The amounts for 2013-14 relate to prior year activity confirmed through an annual acquittal process with the New South Wales Ministry of Health. f. The increase is largely attributable to an increase in compensable and private patients and prior year revenues related to Department of Veterans Affairs patients that had not previously been recognised. g. The increase mainly relates to increased private patient activities in Pathology, Oncology and Medical Imaging specialities. h.

Property, Plant and Equipment (Continued) Fair Value Hierarchy The Directorate is required to classify property, plant and equipment into a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in determining their fair value. The fair value hierarchy is made up of the following three levels: Level 1 - quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Directorate can access at the measurement date; Level 2 - inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and Level 3 - inputs that are unobservable for particular assets or liabilities. Details of the Directorate's property, plant and equipment at fair value and information about the fair value hierarchy as at 2014-15 are as follows: Classification According to Fair Value Hierarchy 2015 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total $'000 $'000 $'000 $'000 Property, Plant and Equipment at Fair Value Land - - 40,645 40,645 Buildings - 2,845 842,902 Details of the Directorate's property, plant and equipment at fair value and information about the Fair Value Hierarchy as at 30 June 2014 is as follows: Classification According to Fair Value Hierarchy 2014 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total $'000 $'000 $'000 $'000 Property, Plant and Equipment at Fair Value Land - - 40,250 40,250 Buildings - 2,845 813,506 816,351 Transfers between Categories There have been no transfers between Levels 1, 2 and 3 during the current and previous reporting period. Valuation Techniques, Inputs and processes Level 2 Valuation Techniques and Inputs Valuation Technique: the technique used to value land and buildings is the market approach that reflects recent transaction prices for similar properties and buildings (comparable in location and size). Inputs: Prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving comparable land and buildings were considered. Regard was taken of the Crown Lease terms and tenure, the Australian Capital Territory Plan and the National Capital Plan, where applicable, as well as current zoning.Health Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2015 ACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-15170Note 28. Property, Plant and Equipment (Continued) Level 3 Valuation Techniques and Inputs Valuation Technique: Land where there is no active market or significant restrictions is valued through the market approach which values a selection of land with similar approximate utility. Inputs: In determining the value of land with similar approximate utility significant adjustments to market based data was required. Valuation Technique: Buildings and Leasehold Improvements were considered specialised assets by the valuers and measured using the cost approach that reflects the cost to a market participant to construct assets of comparable utility adjusted for obsolescence. For buildings historical cost per square metre of floor area was also used in measuring fair value. Inputs: In determining the value of buildings and leasehold improvements regard was given to the age and condition of the assets, their estimated replacement cost and current use. This required the use of data internal to the Directorate. There has been no change to the above valuation techniques during the year.FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT REPORTINGHealth Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2015 SECTION C FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT REPORTING171Note 28.

Capital Works in Progress Capital Works in Progress are assets being constructed over periods of time in excess of the present reporting period. These assets often require extensive installation work or integration with other assets, and contrast with simpler assets that are ready for use when acquired, such as motor vehicles and equipment. Capital Works in Progress are not depreciated as the Directorate is not currently deriving any economic benefits from them. Assets, which are under construction in 2014-15, include hospital buildings, community health centres and computer software. 2015 2014 $'000 $'000 Building Works in Progress a82,785 79,626 Plant and Equipment Works in Progress b227 2,186 Computer Software Works in Progress c48,687 65,914 Other Works in Progress 57 57 Total Capital Works in Progress 131,756 147,783 a.

Financial Instruments Details of the significant policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement, and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised, with respect to each class of financial asset and financial liability are disclosed in Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Directorate does not hold any financial liabilities with floating interest rates, the Directorate is therefore not exposed to movements in interest payable. The Directorate is, however, exposed to movements in interest rates on amounts held in Cash at Bank. Interest rate risk for financial assets is managed by the Directorate by only investing in floating interest rate investments that are low risk. There have been no changes in risk exposure or processes for managing risk since last financial reporting period. A sensitivity analysis has not been undertaken as it is considered that the Directorate's exposure to this risk is insignificant and would have an insignificant impact on the financial results. Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation and cause the other party to incur a financial loss. The Directorate's credit risk is limited to the amount of the financial assets it holds net of any allowance for impairment. The Directorate expects to collect all financial assets that are not past due or impaired. Credit risk is managed by the Directorate for cash at bank by holding bank balances with the ACT Government's banker, Westpac Banking Corporation (Westpac). Westpac holds a AA- issuer credit rating with Standard and Poors. An AA- credit rating is defined as 'very strong capacity to meet financial commitments' .Health Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2015 ACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-15180Note 39. Financial Instruments (Continued) Credit Risk (Continued) Credit risk is managed by the Directorate for investments by only investing surplus funds with the Territory Banking Account, which has appropriate investment criteria for the external fund manager engaged to manage the Territory's surplus funds. The Directorate's receivables are predominantly from ACT Government, Commonwealth Government and insurance companies for compensable patients. As the Commonwealth Government has a AAA credit rating it is considered that there is a very low risk of default for those receivables. There has been no change in credit risk exposure since last reporting period. Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Directorate will encounter difficulties in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or other financial assets. The Directorate's financial obligations relate to the payment of grants and the purchase of supplies and services. Grants are paid on a quarterly basis and purchases of supplies and services are paid within 30 days of receiving the goods or services. The main source of cash to pay these obligations is user charges revenue from the ACT Local Health Network Directorate and appropriation from the ACT Government which is paid on a fortnightly basis during the year. The Directorate manages its liquidity risk through forecasting appropriation drawdown requirements to enable payment of anticipated obligations. See the maturity analysis provided later in this note for further details of when financial assets and liabilities mature. The Directorate's exposure to liquidity risk is considered insignificant based on experience from prior years and the current assessment of risk. Price Risk Price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices (other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk), whether these changes are caused by factors specific to the individual financial instrument or its issuer, or by factors affecting all similar financial instruments traded into the market. The only price risk the Directorate is exposed to results from its investment in the Cash Enhanced Fund. The Directorate has units in the Cash Enhanced Fund that fluctuate in value. The price fluctuation in the units of the portfolio is caused by movements in the underlying investments of the portfolio. The underlying investments are managed by an external fund manager who invests in a variety of different securities, including bonds issued by the Commonwealth Government, the State Government guaranteed treasury corporations and semi-government authorities, as well as investment-grade corporate issues. The Directorate's exposure to price risk and the management of this risk has not changed since last reporting period. A sensitivity analysis has not been undertaken for the price risk of the Directorate as it has been determined that the possible impact on profit and loss or total equity from fluctuations in price is immaterial.

The reduction in operating commitments is due to the property lease for 11 Moore Street expiring on 31 October 2015 and a reduction in the commitment for computer asset leases. b. The reduction is due to the majority of current contracts with non-government organisations for provision of services expiring in June 2016. Note 41.

Budgetary Reporting - Explanations of Major Variances Between Actual Amounts and Original Budget Amounts The following are brief explanations of major line item variances between budget estimates and actual outcomes. Variances are considered to be major variances if both of the following criteria are met: a) The line item is a significant line item: the line item actual amount accounts for more than 10% of the relevant associated category (Income, Expenses and Equity totals) or sub-element (e.g. Current Liabilities and Receipts from Operating Activities totals) of the financial statements; and b) The variances (original budget to actual) are greater than plus (+) or minus (-) 10% of the budget for the financial statement line item. Operating Statement Line Items Original Actual Budget 1 2014-15 2014-15 Variance Variance Variance 78,343 92,810 (14,467) (15.59)Lower than budgeted Grants and Purchased Services is mainly due to work being performed within the Directorate instead of being paid to external organisations. 1 Original Budget refers to the amounts presented to the Legislative Assembly in the original budgeted financial statements in respect of the reporting period (2014-15 Budget Statements).

Budgetary Reporting - Explanations of Major Variances Between Actual Amounts and Original Budget Amounts (Continued) Balance Sheet Line ItemsOriginal Actual Budget 42,075 62,994 149.7Higher than anticipated cash and cash equivalent is largely the result of: higher opening balance of $42 million due to early settlement of cross border receivables in 2013-14; higher net cash flow from operating activities of $40 million; higher capital injection than capital works expenses due to timing delay $7m; partially offset by the return of surplus cash of $27 million to the ACT Government. Receivables - Current27,232 73,236 (46,004) (62.8)Lower receivable balance is mainly due to early settlement of cross border receivables. Property, Plant and Equipment886,129 1,015,328 (129,199) (12.7)This is due to the deferral of capital works projects from 2014-15 to 2015-16 and 2016-17. The major deferrals from 2014-15 into future years are: $10.2 million moved out of this financial year for the Calvary Car Park due to delays in excavation works; $9.6 million moved out of this financial year from postponement of Hospital Road works due to road closures associated with Building 15 demountable installation; $8.0 million moved out of this financial year for the E-Health ICT project due to lengthy delays in contract negotiations which delayed Electronic Medication Management & Clinical Records Information System Replacement Projects; and $7.4 million moved out of this financial year from the clinical services redevelopment - phase 3 project due to delays with procurement of generators. Payables - Current54,269 88,172 (33,903) (38.5)Current payables were lower largely due to early settlement of cross border health costs and capital works invoices. Finance Leases - Current- 2,515 (2,515) (100.0)Finance leases are nil due to a change in leasing arrangements at a whole-of-government level. Motor vehicles are now classified as operating leases. Employee Benefits - Current229,506 187,149 42,357 22.6Employee benefits are higher mainly due to accrued pay rises for Medical Officers, impacts of change in present value discounting factors, impact of higher than budgeted pay rise rates.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \u2014 Territorial The Directorate's accounting policies are contained in Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. The policies outlined in Note 2 apply to both the Controlled and Territorial financial statements. Note 47. Payment for Expenses on Behalf of the Territory - Territorial Under the Financial Management Act 1996, funds can be appropriated for expenses incurred on behalf of the Territory. The Directorate receives this appropriation to fund a number of expenses incurred on behalf of the Territory, being on-passing of appropriated funds for capital funding for Calvary Public Hospital. (See Note 49: Grants and Purchased Services - Territorial) 2015 2014 $'000 $'000 Payment for Expenses on Behalf of the Territory a6,684 4,615 Total Payment for Expenses on Behalf of the Territory 6,684 4,615 a. The increase is due to capital works paid to Calvary Public Hospital for an electrical substation, refurbishment and fit out for 15 new beds in various wards and the refurbishment of clinical spaces. Note 48. Fees - Territorial Fee refers to the collection of licence fees, including from food businesses, smoke free places, boarding houses and radiation equipment. 2015 2014 $'000 $'000 Fees Fees for Regulatory Services a1,268 1,136 Total Fees 1,268 1,136 a. The increase is mainly due to inflation, growth in licence numbers and the introduction of licences for pharmacies. Note 49. Grants and Purchased Services \u2014 Territorial Grants are amounts provided by the Directorate, to ACT Government entities and non-ACT Government entities for general assistance or for a particular purpose. Grants may be for capital, current or recurrent purposes and the name or category reflects the use of the grant. The grants given are usually subject to terms and conditions set out in a contract, correspondence, or by legislation. 2015 2014 $'000 $'000 Capital Grants to External Parties - Calvary Public Hospital a6,684 4,615 Total Grants and Purchased Services 6,684 4,615 a.

Financial Instruments - Territorial Details of the significant policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement, and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised, with respect to each class of financial asset and financial liability are disclosed in Note 46: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Territorial. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Directorate has all of its Territorial financial assets and financial liabilities held in non-interest bearing arrangements. This means that the Directorate is not exposed to movements in interest rates, and, as such does not have any interest rate risk. A sensitivity analysis has not been undertaken for the interest rate risk of the Directorate as it is not exposed to movements in interest rates.Health Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2015 ACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-15198Note 55. Financial Instruments - Territorial (Continued) Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation and cause the other party to incur a financial loss. The Directorate's credit risk is limited to the amount of the financial assets held less an allowance for impairment losses. The Directorate's Territorial financial assets mostly consist of Cash and Cash Equivalents. Credit risk is managed by the Directorate for cash at bank by holding bank balances with the ACT Government's banker, Westpac Banking Corporation (Westpac). Westpac holds a AA- issuer credit rating with Standard and Poors. Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Directorate will be unable to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Directorate's only Territorial financial obligation relates to an advance received from the Territory Banking Account where there is no requirement to repay the advance within the next twelve months. The Directorate's exposure to liquidity risk is therefore insignificant. Price Risk Price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices, whether these changes are caused by factors specific to the individual financial instrument or its issuer, or by factors affecting all similar financial instruments traded in the market. The Directorate holds no investments on behalf of the Territory that are subject to price risk and as a result, is not considered to have any price risk.

Budgetary Reporting - Territorial - Explanations of Major Variances Between Actual Amounts and Original Budget Amounts The following are brief explanations of major line item variances between budget estimates and actual outcomes. Variances are considered to be major variances if both of the following criteria are met: a) The line item is a significant line item: the line item actual amount accounts for more than 10% of the relevant associated category (Income, Expenses and Equity totals) or sub-element (e.g. Current Liabilities and Receipts from Operating Activities totals) of the financial statements; and b) The variances (original budget to actual) are greater than plus (+) or minus (-) 10% of the budget for the financial statement line item. Statement of Income and Expenses on Behalf of The Territory Line ItemsOriginal Actual Budget $'000 on Behalf of the Territory6,684 7,619 (935) (12.3)Payments for expenses on behalf of the Territory are lower than budget mainly due to delays in current year capital works and savings achieved in prior year capital upgrades. Grants and Purchased Services6,684 7,619 (935) (12.3)Grants and purchased services are lower than budget mainly due to delays in current year capital works and savings achieved in prior year capital upgrades. Statement of Assets and Liabilities on Behalf of The Territory Line ItemsOriginal Actual Budget $'000 and Cash Equivalents 242 295 (53) (18.0)Cash and cash equivalents are lower than budget mainly due to timing delay in receiving Goods and Services Tax refund from Australian Taxation Office. Receivables 112 5 107 2,140.0Receivables are higher than budget mainly due to timing of Goods and Services Tax refund from Australian Taxation Office. Advance from the Territory Banking Account350 300 50 16.7Advance from the Territory Banking Account is higher than budget due to additional cash requirement to fund an increase in Goods and Services Tax cash outlay due to increased capital funding transferred to Calvary Hospital, which attracts GST . Statement of Changes in Equity These line items are covered in other financial statements 1 Original Budget refers to the amounts presented to the Legislative Assembly in the original budgeted financial statements in respect of the reporting period (2014-15 Budget Statements).

Health Planning and Infrastructure is responsible for delivering the: HIP , which is a significant investment in future health services for the ACT community and surrounding region Strategic Accommodation and the Capital Upgrades Program (CUP). The HIP , a major capital infrastructure program, responds to a complex mix of population growth and ageing, and changing technology and provider and consumer expectations\u2014all of which contribute to a significant increase in demand for health services in the ACT and to changes in the way services are delivered. Demand for health services is projected to increase rapidly over the next 10 years and beyond. The HIP is a planned, comprehensive and structured response to these pressures. Underpinned by future health services demand projections, the HIP encompasses review of future requirements for models of care and service delivery, technology and workforce in conjunction with a significant capital works program. This reporting year marks the seventh year of the HIP . The CUP is funded annually. It aims to maintain and improve the existing infrastructure supporting the directorate. Work priorities are determined for the following categories: building upgrades electrical, fire and safety upgrades mechanical system upgrades patient and medical facility upgrades workplace improvement upgrades medical and administration office upgrades.Completed projects Projects completed in 2014-15 under the HIP were as follows: Canberra Region Cancer Centre (CRCC) : Officially opened on 6 August 2014, with clinical services commencing on 18 August 2014.

Building audits Twenty-three building condition assessments, hazardous materials audits and fire reports were undertaken as part of a rolling three-year program to assess all buildings managed by ACT Health. These audits are used to inform the directorate's ongoing asset management program. The condition audits assessed these properties as being in normal or average condition. Office accommodation The agency employs 7,064 staff, of whom 1,219 occupy office-style accommodation in the sites listed in Table 6 . The average utilisation rate is 14.5 square metres (m2) per employee. Total office-style accommodation occupied is 17,623m2. Table 57 provides office accommodation details.FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT REPORTING SECTION C FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT REPORTING209C.5 GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING Procurement principles and processes In 2014-15, ACT Health exercised all procurement activities in accordance with the ACT Government tender thresholds and complied with procurement policies and procedures as stated in the Government Procurement Act 2001 and the Government Procurement Regulation 2007 . To ensure compliance with ACT Government procurement legislation, ACT Health: sought advice on government procurement policies and procedures from the Shared Services Procurement and Capital Works Team notified Procurement and Capital Works of all procurements over $25,000 undertaken by ACT Health appropriately referred procurements requiring single, restrictive or open tender procurement processes to Procurement and Capital Works referred all procurements requiring Government Procurement Board consideration and/or approval to Procurement and Capital Works. In accordance with procurement legislation, ACT Health afforded the highest standard of probity and ethical behaviour towards prospective tenderers. Such behaviour included equality, impartiality, transparency and fair dealing. A competitive procurement process is conducted wherever possible; however, due to the specialised nature of the industry, ACT Health frequently accesses single select and restricted select procurement methodologies. These procurement methodologies are justified under the following circumstances: The procurement needs to be compatible (both hardware and software) with existing medical equipment within the clinical setting. Clinical units are seeking to standardise medical equipment with existing equipment. This mitigation strategy reduces the risk of human error when delivering clinical practice because equipment is familiar due to established equipment operating procedures. A limited number of providers possess the specialised medical knowledge and/or expertise to fulfil the agency's requirements. Timing may preclude public tenders being called in situations that could result in disruption to medical services. Single select and/or restricted select procurement processes are completed in accordance with the provisions of the Government Procurement Regulations 2007 and are approved by the Director-General with a statement of justification, as required by the Act. Frequently, ACT Health relies on the NSW Department of Commerce Standing Offer Agreements for restricted select procurement. Through open tender, NSW has a selected a panel of preferred suppliers/providers from which a procurement is made. To use the buying power of the NSW Government, ACT Health frequently asks panel suppliers to offer NSW Department of Commerce pricing on tenders. This strategy: increases the likelihood of better value for money to the Territory in comparison to a stand- alone open tender creates a more efficient procurement process. Social procurement is considered wherever possible. However, due to the specialised nature of its operations, ACT Health is not always able to consider using social enterprise. ACT Health did not undertake any social procurement in 2014-15. An ACT Health Procurement Package was introduced in September 2010 as a tool to educate ACT Health staff of their responsibilities for the proper expenditure of public monies in accordance with the Act. ACT Health requires its staff to seek quotations in accordance with the tender thresholds as stated in the regulations. ACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-15210To further support the correct procurement processes, ACT Health has developed an e-learning package for staff use. This training program assists staff to develop their skills in undertaking procurement and provides procedural guidance on procurement activities. This tool is available through the Capabiliti training management system. Open procurement processes include consideration of local suppliers.

Calvary's services are available to any person in need. The services deliver highly professional and quality clinical care, providing comfort and healing to ACT residents and people from surrounding communities. Calvary Health Care Bruce provides services on behalf of the ACT Government. The principles of this partnership are described in the Calvary Network Agreement; funding and services are negotiated annually and formalised in the Calvary Performance Plan. Calvary Health Care Bruce is a fully accredited health service comprising 275 beds across the Bruce and Barton campuses. The modern facilities are recognised for contemporary and multidisciplinary team-based care, which is provided by a dedicated, well prepared and highly professional workforce. At both campuses the natural environment contributes to holistic healing. Calvary Health Care Bruce is Canberra's second major public hospital and provider of health service. It works in partnership with other acute care, primary care and community-based services. These partnerships are documented formally in the ACT Clinical Services and Network Services Plans. They are underpinned and made effective by clinicians at all levels and in all services being committed to every patient receiving the most appropriate care at the appropriate time in the appropriate setting. The ACT Government and Calvary are committed to expanding the services on the campus to meet the needs of the growing ACT population. Calvary enjoys a good reputation in the Canberra community for the services it provides and the care it delivers. It is well understood in the local community that people of all faiths, and people without a professed faith, enjoy equal access to Calvary's services and that all faith rituals and cultural practices are respected and accommodated.Services provided by Calvary Health Care Bruce include: a 24/7 Emergency Department intensive and coronary care medical and surgical inpatient services maternity services aged care and rehabilitation services voluntary psychiatric services specialist outpatient clinics the Hospital in the Home service. Calvary Health Care Bruce is a teaching hospital associated with the Australian Catholic University, the Australian National University (ANU) and the University of Canberra. Calvary Health Care Bruce operates the ACT Specialist Community Palliative Care Service. This comprises: Clare Holland House, the 19-bed inpatient specialist palliative care service palliative care outpatients clinics a community-based domiciliary palliative care service. Calvary services in the ACT continue the mission of the Sisters of the Little Company of Mary by responding to the needs of the communities we serve. Achievements During 2014-15, Calvary delivered: 56,321 Emergency Department presentations 5,255 elective surgery procedures 1,615 emergency surgery procedures 1,833 births 26,498 cost weights total activity. During 2014-15, Calvary continued enhancing services and facilities at the Bruce campus and at Clare Holland House. This occurred through: refining patient flow processes improving discharge planning following up patients after complex treatmentACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-15244 expanding the Calvary Hospital in the Home program and other service modalities designed to reduce or avoid inpatient admissions where other service options can provide a safe and less disruptive patient experience refining efficient and rapid admission of patients from the Emergency Department to a surgical or medical inpatient setting maintaining a 24-hour emergency surgery capability enhancing the parallel operation in Maternity Services where the midwifery care model and the more traditional maternity model of care continue in parallel embedding the efficient operations of the Rapid Assessment and Planning Unit, Medical Assessment and Planning Unit and Stroke Service Unit, which were established in 2013-14 increasing the services in specialist outpatient clinics improving liaison and placement services for patients transitioning to Aged Care and Retirement residential situations enhancing palliative care services to those in residential aged care settings, and providing support for staff in these settings in support of quality end of life care. Facility enhancements in the reporting period included: continuing the program of replacing floor coverings in public and clinical areas in accordance with environmental hygiene and infection-control best practice continuing refurbishment of patient rooms in Medical and Surgical Units to: heighten infection-control measures increase patient and staff safety improve the amenity of patient rooms and public areas refurbishing public toilets in the Xavier and Marian buildings increasing general medical and surgical and intensive care unit (ICU) bed capacity. These enhancements were completed with negligible disruption to clinical services and minimal effects on patient and visitor amenity.Calvary would like to highlight the partnership of our facilities team, our diverse group of contractors, and the guidance of Barmco Mana Partnership in the ongoing process of accommodating new and contemporary clinical services within the existing footprint of buildings on the Calvary Health Care Bruce campus. The principles and philosophies of this partnership embody our value of stewardship. Multistorey car park construction Construction commenced on the 700+ space multistorey car park at the Calvary Health Care Bruce campus in late 2014. This project will be completed in late 2015. The car park is funded by the ACT Government and is the foundation for future growth and expansion of services at Calvary. It has been recognised for some time that the available parking on the Calvary Bruce campus was: inadequate for existing activity levels an impediment to growing Calvary's capacity to meet the health and hospital needs of the expanding populations of North Canberra, Gungahlin and Molonglo. This barrier will effectively be removed; the commissioning the multistorey car park will enable construction of a new stand-alone Calvary Private Hospital to commence in late 2015. Issues and challenges As with all Australian public health and hospital services, Calvary Health Care Bruce shares the challenge of meeting the growing needs of the community in an environment where state and territory governments, and the Commonwealth Government, endeavour to contain growing health costs. The concurrent factors of longer life expectancy, an ageing population, improved management of chronic conditions, and the consistent emergence of new and expensive health practices and technology, represent a challenge at both network and individual facility levels. Calvary is wholly committed to working with ACT Health to address these challenges. Calvary remains committed to ensuring the community and patients and their carers know that in their time of need services will be available and delivered with respect and compassion by a highly trained and committed workforce and that the quality of care will never be compromised.ATTACHMENTS245 ATTACHMENTSFuture directions The ACT Government Health Infrastructure Program (HIP) and the Bruce Precinct Master Plan are the basis for extensive consultation focused on the future of Calvary in its own right, and its role as a network provider as ACT public health services continue to expand. The general expansion of the public hospital capacity at Calvary Bruce has been foreshadowed and will be assisted by: relocating Calvary Private Hospital from the sixth floor of the Xavier Building later in this decade transferring rehabilitation services to the new subacute hospital at the University of Canberra. While infrastructure growth and service enhancement are significant and enduring, a key aspect of Calvary's future direction is ongoing community engagement and expanding and refining the processes that strengthen the contribution of community providers and hospital- based services to patient centred care. Consumer engagement is a performance measure in contemporary health services; but it also critical to improving the patient experience and enhancing patient satisfaction. Calvary aims to continually explore ways to ensure that each of the almost 65,000 recipients each year experiences an individually fulfilling episode of care that provides the best possible health outcomes. Calvary strives to make every member of the Calvary workforce more aware and more accountable about consumer and carer engagement and involvement in care planning.ACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-15246CHIEF PSYCHIATRIST ANNUAL REPORT 2014-15 The Mental Health (Treatment and Care) Act 1994 was implemented in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) on 6 February 1995.

In 2014-15, 1,020 people were apprehended and brought to Canberra Hospital for assessment. This is an increase of 5 per cent from the previous year, when it was 968. Emergency detention revocations have increased from 295 to 387, a 31 per cent increase from the previous year. This reflects continuing efforts to move to least restrictive care at an early opportunity if at all possible. Applications to extend involuntary detention by up to seven days increased by 4 per cent, indicating the treating team's efforts to continue to appropriately stabilise an acute episode of illness. As previously reported, an increased stability during an admission provides a greater chance of successful ongoing management when a person is discharged to the community. ACAT held 1,224 hearings throughout the year and granted 921 PTOs. This is an increase of 3 per cent from 2013-14. On application by a consultant psychiatrist, or of its own motion, ACAT revoked 156 orders, compared to 167 in the previous reporting period. Ten ECT applications were authorised, which is a marginal increase from the previous year. Two applications for emergency ECT tribunal were made, however only one was authorised. Twelve cross-border agreements were made between the ACT and NSW. The ACT accepted four transfers from NSW, and eight transfers were made to NSW facilities. One transfer was also made to the ACT from a Queensland facility and two transfers were made to Victorian facilities. Breaches of PTOs increased from 80 in 2013-2014 to 90 in 2014-15. This amounts to an increase of 9 per cent from 2013-14. Fifty-nine people were brought to the Mental Health Assessment Unit for medication or assessment purposes, and 22 were admitted to hospital as a result. Community teams make every effort to anticipate and manage crises early. Often, if this is successful, a breach is not required. The ACT Magistrates Court made 63 referrals for assessment pursuant to section 309 of the Crimes Act 1900 , a significant increase of 43 per cent from the previous year. Of these, 37 people required admission to the Adult Mental Health Unit for assessment purposes, with 26 being returned to court on the same day. The Court Assessment Liaison Service continues to provide assessment and advice to the courts at the time of the hearing, which in many circumstances means that a section 309 referral is not required. With the pending implementation of the new Mental Health Act 2014 , a Mental Health Act Strategic Implementation Group has been formed. Implementation plans are in place for the anticipated requirements for training for the revised Act, particularly to support, educate and familiarise clinicians with accompanying changes in assessment and practice. The new Act will begin on 12 November 2015.

In early 2015, Council member Pamela Brown announced her resignation from the Council. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Ms Brown for her service to the Council, and wish her well in her future endeavours. I would also like to welcome Fiona Jolly who is joining the Council as the appointed member of the public. The Council has had a productive year, continuing to issue licenses, register radiation sources and consider issues that may affect the ACT community with regards to radiation safety and protection. From 31 December 2014, the operation of commercial solariums in the ACT was prohibited following an amendment to the Radiation Protection Regulation 2007. The ban was introduced in line with similar changes across a majority of Australian jurisdictions, with an aim of reducing the incidence of melanoma, particularly in young people. The ban has been successfully implemented, with all previously registered tanning units removed from commercial premises as of 1 January 2015. No tanning units are registered in the ACT , and no person holds a licence to possess or operate a commercial solarium. I wish to express my appreciation to the members of the Council for their expert contribution and to the staff of the Health Protection Service for their ongoing support. Council functions The Radiation Protection Act 2006 (www.legislation.act.gov.au ) controls the safe use, storage, transportation and disposal of radioactive material and irradiating apparatus. The Council is established under Part 5 of the Radiation Protection Act 2006, and has the following functions: issuing licences registering regulated radiation sources advising the Minister on radiation protection issues exercising any other function given to it under the Radiation Protection Act 2006 or another territory law.Council membership The composition of the Council is specified in section 65 of the Radiation Protection Act 2006 . Seven members are currently appointed to the Council, as shown in Table 1 . Table 1: Council members Name Position held Appointed until Elizabeth Croft Chair 30 November 2016 Sean Geoghegan Deputy Chair 30 September 2015 Mervyn Despois Member 30 November 2016 Donald McLean Member 30 November 2016 Stephen Tims Member 30 November 2016 Ahmad Javaid Member 30 September 2015 Fiona Jolly Incoming member 30 November 2016 Pamela Brown Outgoing member Retired from Council Council meetings 2014-2015 The Council meets approximately every six weeks and met nine times during 2014-2015. Meetings were held in: July, August, September, November and December of 2014 February, March, April and June of 2015. Regulatory standards The Council refers to a number of standards, codes of practice, safety guides, and recommendations when: considering matters relating to radiation protection issuing licences and approving registrations under the Radiation Protection Act 2006 . This includes documents in the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA) Radiation Protection Series, which are available free of charge from www.arpansa.gov.au .ATTACHMENTS251 ATTACHMENTSNational Directory for Radiation Protection The National Directory for Radiation Protection (the Directory) provides the basis for achieving uniformity of radiation protection practices across Australian jurisdictions, and is an incorporated document under the Radiation Protection Act 2006 . The Directory is designed to be regularly updated to reflect the best radiation protection practice of the time. The Directory is prepared by the ARPANSA Radiation Health Committee, and is only updated in accordance with prescribed processes. The Council is regularly briefed on developments with regard to the work of the ARPANSA Radiation Health Committee. ACT Health has a jurisdictional representative appointed to the committee. Council activities Approvals and decisions Licences The Council issued 194 new licences during the 2014-15 year, while 169 licences were not renewed. Overall this represents a 2.2% increase (25 licences) bringing the total number of licence holders in the ACT to 1,142. Registrations The Council registered 58 new radiation sources during the 2014-15 year, while 41 sources were decommissioned or transferred interstate. Overall this represents a 2.8% increase (17 sources) bringing the total number of registered radiation sources in the ACT to 602. Radiation incidents Eight radiation incidents were reported to the Council during the year and underwent further investigation, as explained in Table 2 .Table 2: Radiation incidents Incident typeNo. incidents Details Radiotherapy 3One* incident involved equipment malfunction (safety interlock). One incident involved equipment malfunction (system calibration and correction). One incident involved a higher than normal result on a personal monitoring device. Diagnostic Radiology4One incident involved the potential to deliver a diagnostic procedure other than prescribed. Two* incidents involved a higher than normal result on a personal monitoring device. One incident involved medical equipment malfunction. Nuclear Medicine1One * incident, which involved a diagnostic procedure other than prescribed. Following investigation, four of these incidents (marked with an asterisk *) were reported to ARPANSA for inclusion on the Australian Radiation Incident Register. In line with the ACT Health Risk Management Guidelines, the four incidents reported to ARPANSA were considered to be of minor consequence. The remaining four incidents were deemed insignificant. The areas involved undertook reviews of working systems and, where necessary, amended procedures to reduce the likelihood of similar incidents occurring in the future. Enforcement and remedial actions by the Council No investigations or legal proceedings were commenced in 2014-2015.

The ACT Local Hospital Council (Council), constituted under the Act, provides advice to the Director-General of the Health Directorate on the clinical and corporate governance framework needed to support the improvement in standards of patient care and services provided through the ACT LHN. The Council also advises on ways to support, encourage and facilitate community and clinician involvement in the planning of services that form part of the ACT LHN. The Council reports to the Minister for Health on the state of the ACT LHN and any recommendations relating to improvement of the ACT LHN that the Council considers necessary. The ACT LHN receives Activity Based Funding (ABF) from both the Commonwealth and the ACT Governments, and block funding for teaching, training and research. It purchases public hospital services from four ACT public hospital providers: Canberra Hospital and Health Services; Calvary Public Hospital; Clare Holland House; and Queen Elizabeth II Family Centre. Risk Management The Directorate's management has identified the following potential risk that may influence the future financial position of the Directorate. Actual public hospital activity (inpatient and outpatient services) delivered by entities in the ACT Local Hospital Network is lower than the budgeted activity resulting in a reduction of funding from the Commonwealth Government. The Commonwealth Government will fund 45 per cent of the growth in public hospital activity from 2015-16 and the ACT Government and the Directorate will agree on the process for managing fluctuation in activity and costs from 2015-16. The above risk is monitored regularly throughout the year. Financial Performance The following financial information is based on audited financial statements for 2013-14 and 2014-15, and the forward estimates contained in the 2015-16 Health Directorate and ACT LHN Budget Statements.ACT LOCAL HOSPITAL NETWORK DIRECTORATEATTACHMENTS ATTACHMENTS253Total Net Cost of Services Actual Budget Actual Budget Forward Forward Forward Estimate Estimate 649.6 669.5 Comparison net cost of services for 2014-15 of $563.1 million was $38.7 million or 6.4 per cent lower than the 2014-15 budget (refer to Attachment A). This was mainly due to higher activity based funding and cross border revenue due to increased patient numbers compared to the estimate used in the budget. Comparison to 2013-14 Actual Expenses There was an increase of $24.9 million or 4.6% compared to the 2013-14 net cost of service of $538.2 million. This is due to higher expenses of $50.4 million from growth in public hospital activity, including acute services, mental health services and cancer services and an increase in the price paid for these services. Higher expenses are partially offset by an increase in own source revenue of $25.7 million from Commonwealth grant funding for growth in services and an increase in the price paid for these services. Future Trends Figure 1: Net Cost of Services Figure 1: Net Cost Actual Budget Forward Forward Forward Estimate Estimate Estimate Total Expenditure Total Own Source Revenue Net Cost of Services 200.0400.0600.0800.01,000.01,200.0 As shown above in Figure 1, net cost of services is expected to increase across the forward years. Total Expenditure Components of Expenditure Figure 2 below shows that for the financial year ended 30 June 2015, 99.4 per cent of total expenditure ($966.0 million) relates to grants and purchased services. ACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-15254 Transfer Expenses 0.6%Grants and Purchased Services 94.4% Figure 2 - Components of Expenditure Comparison to Budget Total expenses of $966.0 million was $8.9 million, or 0.9 per cent higher than the original 2014-15 budget of $957.1 million. Comparison to 2013-14 Actual Expenses Total expenses were $50.6 million or 5.5 per cent higher than the 2013-14 actual result. This was due to growth in public hospital activity, including acute services, mental health services and cancer services, and inflation. Future Trends Expenses are budgeted to steadily increase across the forward estimate years. Total Revenue Components of Revenue Figure 3 below indicates that for the financial year ended 30 June 2015, the Directorate received 58.4 per cent of its total revenue of $970.1 million from Government Payment for Outputs ($567.3 million), 9.5 per cent from Cross Border User Charges ($91.9 million), with the remaining 32.1 per cent made up of Grants from the Commonwealth ($311.0 million). Grants from the Commonwealth 32.1%User Charges - Non-ACT Government 9.5%Government Payments for Outputs 58.4% Figure 3 - Components of Own Source Revenue Comparison to Budget Own source revenue for the year ending 30 June 2015 was $402.9 million, which was $47.6 million or 13.4 per cent higher than the 2014-15 budget of $355.3 million. The higher own source revenue is due to higher activity based funding and cross border revenue from higher patient numbers than estimated in the budget.ATTACHMENTS ATTACHMENTS255Comparison to 2013-14 Actual Income Own source revenue was $25.7 million or 6.8 per cent higher than the 2013-14 result of $377.2 million. The increase is mainly due to an increase in the price paid for services and growth in public hospital activity including acute services, mental health services and cancer services funded through the National Health Reform Agreement. Future Trends Total own source revenue is expected to increase steadily. Financial Position Total Assets Components of Total Assets Figure 4 below indicates that, as at 30 June 2015, the Directorate held total assets of $17.6 million with 72.1 per cent of its assets in receivables and 27.9 per cent in cash and cash equivalents. Cash and Cash Equivalents 27.9% Receivables 72.1% Figure 4 - Total Assets as at 30 June 2015 Comparison to Budget The total asset position as at 30 June 2015 is $17.6 million, which exceeds the 2014-15 budget of $16.7 million by $0.9 million. The variance reflects an increase in: Receivables ($11.5 million) - which relates to the cross border receivables from other jurisdictions for the treatment of their residents in ACT hospitals and a refund of GST from the Australian Taxation Office; offset by a decrease in Cash and Cash Equivalents ($10.6 million) - relates to the return of surplus cash to the ACT Government ($20.0 million) offset by the receipt of prior year cross border receivables from the New South Wales Ministry of Health. Comparison to 2013-14 Actual The Directorate's total asset position is $18.6 million lower than the 2013-14 actual result of $36.2 million. This is mainly due to the return of surplus cash to the ACT Government ($20.0 million) offset by the receipt of prior year cross border receivables from the New South Wales Ministry of Health.ACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-15256Total Liabilities Components of Total Liabilities 100.0 per cent of the Directorate's liabilities relates to payables. Comparison to Budget The Directorate's liabilities as at 30 June 2015 was $6.6 million, which relates to cross border payables owed to other jurisdictions for admitted and non admitted patient services provided to residents of the ACT in hospitals outside of the ACT that were not anticipated in the budget. Comparison to 2013-14 Actual Total liabilities were $2.7 million lower than the actual results as at 30 June 2014 of $9.3 million. The lower level of payables in 2014-15 is due to higher level of provisional payments made by the Directorate to the New South Wales Ministry of Health for cross border health services, which has resulted in a lesser amount owed at year end. Net Assets The Directorate's net assets as at 30 June 2015 were $5.7 million lower than the $16.7 million budgeted. This is mainly due to payables owed for cross border services not included in the budget.

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (a) Basis of Preparation The Financial Management Act 1996 (FMA) requires the preparation of annual financial statements for ACT Government agencies. The FMA and the Financial Management Guidelines issued under the Act, requires the Directorate's financial statements to include: i) an Operating Statement for the year; ii) a Balance Sheet at the end of the year; iii) a Statement of Changes in Equity for the year; iv) a Cash Flow Statement for the year; v) a Statement of Appropriation for the year; vi) an Operating Statement for each class of output for the year; vii) a summary of the significant accounting policies adopted for the year; and viii) such other statements as are necessary to fairly reflect the financial operations of the Directorate during the year and its financial position at the end of the year. These general-purpose financial statements have been prepared to comply with 'Generally Accepted Accounting Principles' (GAAP) as required by the FMA. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with: i) Australian Accounting Standards; and ii) ACT Accounting and Disclosure Policies. The financial statements have been prepared using the accrual basis of accounting, which recognises the effects of transactions and events when they occur. The financial statements have also been prepared according to the historical cost convention. These financial statements are presented in Australian dollars, which is the Directorate's functional currency. The Directorate is an individual reporting entity.ACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-15268 Health Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2015Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) (b) Controlled and Territorial Items The Directorate produces Controlled financial statements. The Controlled financial statements include income, expenses, assets and liabilities over which the Directorate has control. The Directorate does not produce Territorial financial statements because it does not administer any resources on behalf of the Territory. (c) The Reporting Period These financial statements state the financial performance, changes in equity and cash flows of the Directorate for the year ending 30 June 2015 together with the financial position of the Directorate as at 30 June 2015. (d) Comparative Figures Budget Figures To facilitate a comparison with Budget Papers, as required by the Financial Management Act 1996 , budget information for 2014-2015 has been presented in the financial statements. Budget numbers in the financial statements are the original budget numbers that appear in the Budget Papers. Prior Year Comparatives Comparative information has been disclosed in respect of the previous period for amounts reported in the financial statements, except where an Australian Accounting Standard does not require comparative information to be disclosed. Where the presentation or classification of items in the financial statements is amended, the comparative amounts have been reclassified where practical. Where a reclassification has occurred, the nature, amount and reason for the reclassification is provided. (e) Rounding All amounts in the financial statements have been rounded to the nearest thousand dollars ($'000). Use of the \" \" symbol represents zero amounts or amounts rounded up or down to zero. (f) Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable in the Operating Statement. All revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Directorate and the revenue can be reliably measured. In addition, the following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised: Government Payment for Outputs Government Payment for Outputs are recognised as revenues when the Directorate gains control over the funding. Control over appropriated funds is normally obtained upon the receipt of cash. Cross Border (Interstate) Health Revenue Revenue for cross border (interstate) health services is recognised when the number of patients and complexities of treatments provided can be measured reliably using the price payable for the service. The price payable for services is determined by the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority. Actual patient numbers and services are settled following an acquittal process undertaken in subsequent years and variations to the revenue recognised are accounted for in the year of settlement.ATTACHMENTS269 ATTACHMENTSHealth Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2015Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) (f) Revenue Recognition (Continued) The National Health Reform Agreement specifies that each jurisdiction will make funding contributions through the National Health Funding Pool for services provided by other jurisdictions to its residents either on an ad hoc basis reflecting actual activity, or on a regular basis as scheduled through a Cross Border agreement. For 2014-15 the ACT has a Cross Border Agreement in place with the New South Wales Ministry of Health. Commonwealth Grants Commonwealth Grants relate to Activity Based Funding and Block Funding under the National Health Reforms. They also include the Commonwealth funding component of cross border health costs for interstate residents treated in ACT public hospitals. Activity based funding (ABF) refers to a national system for funding public hospital services using national classifications, national price weights and a national efficient price (NEP). It is predicated on the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority (IHPA) pricing model which has set weights and pricing adjustments based on patient characteristics, that together give rise to a total payment amount for a hospital patient service. ABF covers all admitted, non admitted and emergency department services that meet the IHPA criteria for inclusion on the 'General List of In Scope Public Hospital Services' . For 2014-15, ABF was paid at a rate of 45% of the NEP for activity above last year's baseline, with base activity payment paid at last year's rate plus price indexation. Block funding is provided to support public hospital functions that are recognised by the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority as services acceptable to be funded on this basis and that conform to the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority's national pricing model. Commonwealth Grants is calculated and paid using estimates. The estimate is based on expected number of patients treated during the year. Further information on the basis of the estimate is provided in Note 2(O): Significant Accounting Judgements and Estimates. Commonwealth Grants are recognised as revenues upon the receipt of cash. Revenue Received in Advance Revenue Received in Advance is recognised as a liability if there is a present obligation to return the funds received, otherwise all funds received are recorded as revenue. (g) Waivers of Debt Debts that are waived during the year under Section 131 of the Financial Management Act 1996 are expenses during the year in which the right to payment was waived. Further details of waivers are disclosed at Note 9: Waivers, Impairment Losses and Writeoffs . (h) Current and Non-Current Items Assets and liabilities are classified as current or non-current in the Balance Sheet and in the relevant notes. Assets are classified as current where they are expected to be realised within 12 months after the reporting date. Liabilities are classified as current when they are due to be settled within 12 months after the reporting date or when the Directorate does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date. Assets or liabilities which do not fall within the current classification are classified as non-current.ACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-15270 Health Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2015Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) (i) Cash and Cash Equivalents For the purposes of the Cash Flow Statement and the Balance Sheet, cash includes cash at bank and cash on hand. Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. (j) Receivables Accounts receivable are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, with any adjustments to the carrying amount being recorded in the Operating Statement. Accrued Cross Border revenue relates to the estimated number of interstate patients treated in an ACT public hospital for 2014-15. Under the National Health Reform Agreement, States and Territories are required to pay for Cross Border activity using the price payable for services. The price payable for services is determined by the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority. The actual level of revenue will be subject to an acquittal process to be completed in subsequent years. The allowance for impairment losses represents the amount of receivables the Directorate estimates will not be repaid. The allowance for impairment losses is based on objective evidence and a review of overdue balances. The Directorate considers the following is objective evidence of impairment: becoming aware of financial difficulties of debtors; default payments; or debts more than 90 days overdue. The amount of the allowance is the difference between the assets' carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. Cash flows relating to short term receivables are not discounted if the effect of discounting is immaterial. The amount of the allowance is recognised in the Operating Statement. The allowance for impairment loss is written off against the allowance account when the Directorate ceases action to collect the debt as it considers that it will cost more to recover the debt than the debt is worth. Receivables that have been renegotiated because they are past due or impaired are accounted for based on the renegotiated terms. (k) Payables Payables are a financial liability and are initially recognised at fair value based on the transition costs and subsequent to initial recognition at amortised cost, with any adjustments to the carrying amount being recorded in the Operating Statement. All amounts are normally settled within 30 days after the invoice date. (l) Employee Costs and Employee Benefits Liabilities The Directorate does not employ any staff. All staff providing administrative support are employed by the Health Directorate. Therefore, the Directorate does not incur any employee costs and does not have any employee benefit liabilities.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) (m) Equity Contributed by the ACT Government Contributions made by the ACT Government, through its role as owner of the Directorate, are treated as contributions of equity. Increases or decreases in net assets as a result of Administrative Restructures are also recognised in equity. (n) Budgetary Reporting Explanations of major variances between the 2014-15 original budget and the 30 June 2015 actual results are discussed in Note 21: Budgetary Reporting. The definition of 'major variances' is provided in Note 2(o): Significant Accounting Judgements and Estimates - Budgetary Reporting. Original budget refers to the original budgeted financial statements presented to the Legislative Assembly in a form that is consistent with the Directorate's annual financial statements. The 2014-15 budget numbers have not been audited. Budgetary reporting is disclosed for controlled financial statements with the exception of Statement of Changes in Equity as relevant line items are included in other financial statements. (o) Significant Accounting Judgements and Estimates In the process of applying the accounting policies listed in this note, the Directorate has made the following judgements and estimates that have the most significant impact on the amounts recorded in the financial statements: Cross Border (Interstate) Health Receivables : is an estimation based on the number of interstate patients converted into a National Weighted Activity Unit and paid at the price determined by the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority. Interstate patient numbers for the current year is an estimation based on actual patient numbers for the nine months to 30 April 2015. Actual patient numbers and services are settled following an acquittal process undertaken in subsequent years and variations to the revenue recognised are accounted for in the year of settlement. Commonwealth Grants : is an estimation based on the expected number of patients converted into a National Weighted Activity Unit and paid at the price determined by the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority. Actual National Weighted Activity Units is settled following an acquittal process undertaken in the following financial year and variations to the revenue recognised are accounted for in the year of settlement. Budgetary Reporting : Significant judgements have been applied in determining what variances are considered as 'major variances' requiring explanations in Note 21: Budgetary Reporting. Variances are considered to be major variances if both of the following criteria are met: The line item is a significant line item: the line item actual amount accounts for more than 10% of the relevant associated category (Income, Expenses and Equity totals) or sub-element (e.g. Current Liabilities and Receipts from Operating Activities totals) of the financial statements; and The variances (original budget to actual) are greater than plus (+) or minus (-) 10% of the budget for the financial statement line item. Further information on this is provided in Note 2(n): Budgetary Reporting.ACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-15272 Health Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2015Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) (p) Impact of Accounting Standards Issued but yet to be Applied The following new and revised accounting standards and interpretations have been issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board but do not apply to the current reporting period. These standards and interpretations are applicable to future reporting periods. The Directorate does not intend to adopt these standards and interpretations early. Where applicable, these Australian Accounting Standards will be adopted from their application date. AASB 9 Financial Instruments (December 2014) (application date 1 January 2018); This standard supersedes AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. The main impact of AASB 9 is that it will change the classification, measurement and disclosure of the financial assets. No material financial impact on the Directorate is expected. AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (application date 1 January 2017); AASB 15 is the new standard for revenue recognition. It establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when revenue is recognised. It replaces AASB 111 Construction Contracts and AASB 118 Revenue. No material financial impact on the Directorate is expected as the Directorate's current revenue recognition is already in line with the requirement of this standard. Note 3. Government Payment for Outputs Government Payment for Outputs (GPO) is revenue received from the ACT Government for the purchase of hospital services from ACT public hospitals. The ACT Government pays GPO appropriation on a fortnightly basis. 2015 2014 $'000 $'000 Revenue from the ACT Government Government Payment for Outputs a 567,279 550,054 Total Government Payment for Outputs 567,279 550,054 a. The increase is due to growth in services in acute services, mental health, community health centres, the Centenary Hospital for Women and Children, the Canberra Region Cancer Centre, community nursing, the emergency department, and outpatient and imaging services. Note 4. User Charges - Non-ACT Government User charge revenue is derived by providing public hospital services to interstate residents. User charge revenue is not part of ACT Government appropriation and is paid by other state or territory governments. This revenue is driven by demand for health services from interstate patients and is not for profit in nature. 2015 2014 $'000 $'000 User Charges - Non-ACT Government Cross Border (Interstate) Health Revenue a91,906 101,992 Total User Charges - Non-ACT Government 91,906 101,992 a. 2013-14 included additional one-off revenue relating to prior year acquittals for cross border activity from several jurisdictions.

Grants from the Commonwealth Grants from the Commonwealth reflect contributions from the Commonwealth for Activity Based Funding and Block Funding, as well as a contribution for public health services. 2015 2014 $'000 $'000 Grants from the Commonwealth Grants a310,958 275,181 Total Grants from the Commonwealth 310,958 275,181 a. The increase is mainly due to an increase in the price paid for services and growth in activity for public hospital services funded through the National Health Reform Agreement. Note 6. Grants and Purchased Services Grants and Purchased Services reflect public hospital payments to the Canberra Hospital and Health Services, Calvary Public Hospital, Clare Holland House, Queen Elizabeth II Hospital, and States and the Northern Territory for cross border patient services. 2015 2014 $'000 $'000 Purchased Services Payments to Service Providers - Canberra Hospital and Health Services a754,745 711,956 - Calvary Public Hospital a178,557 167,133 - Clare Holland House 5,114 4,870 - Queen Elizabeth II Hospital 2,534 2,482 Cross Border (Interstate) Health Costs b19,547 23,643 Total Grants and Purchased Services 960,497 910,084 a. The increase is mainly due to an increase in the price paid for services and growth in public hospital services. b. The decrease is mainly due to the finalisation of prior year acquittals for several jurisdictions during 2013-14 which resulted in recognising additional expense in 2013-14. Note 7. Transfer Expenses Transfer Expenses relate to the on-passing of the Commonwealth's contribution to public health funding to the Health Directorate. 2015 2014 $'000 $'000 Transfer Expenses 5,542 5,316 Total Transfer Expenses 5,542 5,316 Note 8.

Waivers, Impairment Losses and Write- Offs Under Section 131 o f the Financial Management Act 1996 the Treasurer may, in writing, waive the right to payment of an amount payable to the Territory. A waiver is the relinquishment of a legal claim to a debt over which the Directorate has control. The write-off of a debt is the accounting action taken to remove a debt from the books but does not relinquish the legal right of the Directorate to recover the amount. The write-off of debts may occur for reasons other than waivers. The Directorate had no waivers, im pairment losses or write-offs in 2014-15 (nil, 2013-14). Note 10. Act of Grace Payments Under Section 130 of the Financial Management Act 1996 the Treasurer may, in writing, authorise Act of Grace Payments to be made by a Directorate. Act of Grace payments are a method of providing equitable remedies to entities or individuals that may have been unfairly disadvantaged by the ACT Government but have no legal claim to the payment. The Directorate made no Act of Grace Payments during 2014-15 (nil, 2013-14). Note 11. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Directorate holds a number of bank accounts on which it does not earn interest. These funds are able to be withdrawn upon request. 2015 2014 $'000 $'000 Cash at Bank a4,902 12,277 Total Cash and Cash Equivalents 4,902 12,277 a. The decrease is due to the return of surplus cash to the ACT Government ($20.0 million) offset by the receipt of prior year cross border receivables from the New South Wales Ministry of Health. Note 12. Receivables 2015 2014 $'000 $'000 Current Receivables Accrued Revenue a11,318 22,563 Net GST Receivable 1,332 1,264 Total Current Receivables 12,650 23,827 Total Receivables 12,650 23,827 a. The reduction is mainly due to increased provisional payments from the New South Wales Ministry of Health for cross border health services in 2014-15 resulting in lower level outstanding debt. Overdue Ageing of ReceivablesNot Overdue Less than 30 to Greater Total 30 Days 60 Days than 60 Days $'000 $'000 $'000 $'000 $'000 2015 Not Impaired Receivables a12,650 - - - 12,650 Impaired Receivables - - - - - 2014 Not Impaired Receivables 23,827 - - - 23,827 Impaired Receivables - - - - - a. This mainly relates to cross border receivables for admitted and non-admitted patient services provided to residents of the States and the Northern Territory. This is categorised as 'not overdue' as the funding agreement does not mandate a timeframe for payment prior to final acquittal of activity numbers for each period and the final acquittals are yet to occur.ATTACHMENTS275 ATTACHMENTSHealth Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2015Note 12.

This is accrued cross border expenses owed to the States and the Northern Territory for health services provided to residents of the ACT in the States and the Northern Territory. The reduction reflects higher level provisional payments made by the Directorate to the New South Wales Ministry of Health during 2014-15 which has resulted in a lesser amount owed at year end.ACT HEAL TH Annual Report 2014-15276 Health Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2015Note 15. Financial Instruments Details of the significant policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement, and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised, with respect to each class of financial asset and financial liability are disclosed in Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Directorate is considered to have no exposure to interest rate risk, as it holds only cash and cash equivalents with Westpac Banking Corporation and Reserve Bank of Australia that generate no interest, and receivables are non-interest bearing. A sensitivity analysis has not been undertaken for the interest rate risk of the Directorate as it is not exposed to movements in interest rates. Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation and cause the other party to incur a financial loss. The Directorate's credit risk is limited to the amount of the financial assets held less any allowance for impairment. The Directorate's financial assets consist of Cash and Cash Equivalents and Receivables. Cash and cash equivalents are held with the Westpac Banking Corporation, a high credit, quality financial institution, in accordance with whole of ACT Government banking arrangements and at year end the Directorate holds no investments. The Directorate's receivables mainly consist of amounts owed from the New South Wales Ministry of Health and the Department of Health and Human Services in Victoria. As the New South Wales and Victorian Governments both have a AAA credit rating it is considered that there is a very low risk of default for these receivables. Any credit risk for receivables with New South Wales Ministry of Health and Department of Health and Human Services in Victoria is managed by having an agreement in place providing required activity data in a timely manner. Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Directorate will encounter difficulties in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The main source of cash to pay these obligations is appropriation from the ACT Government and Grants from the Commonwealth. Appropriation is paid on a fortnightly basis and the Commonwealth Grants on a monthly basis during the year. The Directorate manages its liquidity risk through forecasting appropriation drawdown requirements to enable payment of anticipated obligations. Price Risk Price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices, whether these changes are caused by factors specific to the individual financial instrument or its issuer, or by factors affecting all similar financial instruments traded in the market. The Directorate holds no financial instruments that are subject to price risk and as a result, is not considered to have any price risk. Accordingly, a sensitivity analysis has not been undertaken.ATTACHMENTS277 ATTACHMENTSHealth Directorate Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 30 June 2015Note 15.

Service Concession Asset The Directorate has entered into an agreement with Calvary Health Care ACT Ltd for the provision of hospital and associated services. The original agreement was entered into by the Commonwealth on 22 October 1971 and does not stipulate any expiry date. This was subsequently amended in 1979 to include the Directorate (named at the time as Capital Territory Health Commission) with any duties or functions of the Commonwealth being transferred to the Directorate. The Agreement was for the facility to be used for a public hospital. This was varied, in 1988, by the Calvary Private Agreement to allow Calvary Health Care Ltd to use two floors of the facility for treating private patients. The Calvary Private Agreement sets the process and mechanism for Calvary Private to reimburse Calvary Public for any costs incurred in using public hospital facilities for treating private patients. These agreements were replaced on 7 December 2011 with the Calvary Network Agreement. Under the agreement, Calvary Health Care ACT Ltd is required to provide hospital services and make these services available to all persons irrespective of their circumstances and is to charge patients fees only in accordance with the scale of fees applicable at Health Directorate hospitals for comparable services. In the event that the agreement ceases, all land is to be returned to the Territory. The level of services that is required to be provided in a financial year, for the amount of funding provided, is stipulated in a Performance Plan agreed between the Directorate and Calvary Health Care ACT Ltd for each year. The land, hospital buildings and other assets comprising the Calvary Public Hospital are not recognised in the Directorate's Balance Sheet.

Budgetary Reporting - Explanations of Major Variances Between Actual Amounts and Original Budget Amounts The following are brief explanations of major line item variances between budget estimates and actual outcomes. Variances are considered to be major variances if both of the following criteria are met: a) The line item is a significant line item: the line item actual amount accounts for more than 10% of the relevant associated category (Income, Expenses and Equity totals) or sub-element (e.g. Current Liabilities and Receipts from Operating Activities totals) of the financial statements; and b) The variances (original budget to actual) are greater than plus (+) or minus (-) 10% of the budget for the financial statement line item. Operating Statement Line ItemsOriginal Actual Budget 271,080 39,878 14.7Higher than budgeted Grants from the Commonwealth is due to higher levels of activity for public hospital services funded through the National Health Reform Agreement than estimated in the budget. 1 Original Budget refers to the amounts presented to the Legislative Assembly in the original budgeted financial statements in respect of the reporting period (2014-15 Budget Statements). These amounts have not been adjusted to reflect supplementary appropriation or appropriation instruments. Balance Sheet Line ItemsOriginal Actual Budget 15,502 (10,600) (68.4)Lower than budgeted Cash and Cash Equivalents is largely due to the return of $20 million surplus cash to the ACT Government and lower opening balance of $3 million which are partially offset by higher cashflow from operating activities due to timing of payable and receivables $13 million. Receivables 12,650 1,177 11,473 974.8Higher than budgeted Receivables is due to timing of acquittal of cross border health services provided to the residents of other jurisdictions. Payables 6,605 - 6,605 100.0Higher than budgeted Payables is due to timing of acquittals of cross border health services provided to residents of other jurisdictions. Accumulated Funds 10,947 16,679 (5,732) (34.4)Lower than budgeted Accumulated Funds is largely due to the return of $20 million surplus cash to the ACT Government offset by $4 million in operating surplus, the receipt of prior year cross border payments and the recognition of current year cross border receivables and payables. Statement of Changes in Equity These line items are covered in other financial statements 1 Original Budget refers to the amounts presented to the Legislative Assembly in the original budgeted financial statements in respect of the reporting period (2014-15 Budget Statements).

This was due to increased Commonwealth and Cross Border revenue due to revised forecasts for revenue from the Commonwealth for activity based funding and from other jurisdictions for Cross Border activity. As such less GPO was drawndown. Accountability Indicators a. Admitted Services - NWAU 72%Activity was higher than anticipated in the budget. The target published in the ACT Budget was based on an estimate provided to the National Health Funding Body in March 2014 that was revised in May 2014 to around 17,000 based on more up to date information.1,3 c. Emergency Services - NWAU {14} 15,929 15,727 -1% - NWAU {14}4,778 6,248 31%Activity was higher than target due to greater demand than anticipated in the budget.1, 4 e.

Total in scope - NWAU {14} 123,663 133,795 8%Activity was higher than anticipated in the budget. This is largely explained by the variance arising for non-admitted patient services (Indicator 1b).1 g.

Proportion of mental health clients contacted by a Health Directorate community facility within 7 days post discharge from inpatient services85% 72% -15%The proportion of mental health clients contacted by Health Directorate was lower than anticipated in the budget. In setting the target, the number of mental health inpatient episodes was thought to be smaller. Changes in data collection methodology and system integration have resulted in better capturing of clients with an inpatient episode.6 The above Statement of Performance should be read in conjunction with the accompanying notes. Explanation of Measures 1. Activity purchased by the Local Hospital Network is consistent with the criteria in the National Health Reform Agreement. Activity is measured in National Weighted Activity Units {14} as defined by the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority's National Efficient Price Determination 2014-15. These measures combine the results for Canberra Hospital and Calvary Public Hospital for services that meet the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority's criteria for inclusion on the 'General List of In-Scope Public Hospital Services' . 2. Excludes mental health and sub-acute services. 3. Excludes community mental health services. 4. Acute admitted mental health services only. 5. Proportion of eligible mental health registered clients receiving ongoing mental health care having clinical outcome measures completed appropriate to each episode of care and service setting and the outcome measure collection protocol. Service settings included are inpatient, community and residential care. All age groups included. Eligible clients are people receiving mental health services on an ongoing basis, have a case manager assigned and are in contact with mental health services in the reference period. 6. The proportion of clients admitted to a public mental health acute inpatient facility within the Local Hospital Network and having direct contact with mental health services within seven days post discharge. Day of discharge is not included as part of the seven days. Same day admissions are excluded.
