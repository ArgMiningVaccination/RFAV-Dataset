Integrative medicine encourages a woman to take charge of her life. It helps women make choices in their lives to help prevent breast cancer, slow its growth if it occurs, and prevent the disease from coming back after it has been treated. It may also he lp reduce the side effects from cancer treatment. Integrative medicine combines standard medical care with additional ways to prevent or treat a condition. These other ways are called complementary medicine. If a complementary approach might interfere w ith standard cancer treatment, it is avoided while a woman is receiving treatment. Integrative medicine uses evidence -based therapies when available. These therapies are based on the best available research and clinical experience. Integrative Medicine focuses on healing the body, mind, and spirit. Each person has a unique path to healing. Oftentimes cancer may serve as an opportunity for growth and greater health. What are some integrative ways to reduce side effects from breast cancer treatment ? Fatigue Fatigue is a common symptom of cancer and its treatment. Daily gentle exercise and acupuncture may help. Hot Flashes Breast cancer survivors have 10% more sleep problems than women the same age who have never had cancer. These problems tend to last over time. Along with sleep problems, the survivors have hot flashes, depression, more distress, and worse physical conditioning. In one study, breast cancer survivors had less physical activity and more hot flashes than women without breast cancer. Exercise, acupuncture, and a number of medications may help with hot flashes from menopause. Black cohosh is an herb sold as a diet supplement. It has been used for hot flashes. I n one study, black cohosh decreased the risk of breast cancer. Generally it is not helpful in controlling hot flashes. Black cohosh can be harmful to the liver. Use it only with the guidance of your clinician. Integrative Ways T o Reduce Side Effects Of Breast Cancer Treatment Guidelines on Exercise and Nutrition The American Cancer Society (ACS ) publishes guidelines on nutrition and physical activity. A panel of experts updates these guidelines every five years. If you are reading this handout on -line, click on the link below (or copy and paste it into your browser) to see recommendations for during and after cancer treatment. The guidelines were updated in Integrative Ways To Reduce Side Effects Of Breast Cancer Treatment PATIENT HANDOUT 2 University of Wisconsin Integrative Medicine www.fammed.wisc.edu/integrative Nausea and Vomiting Acupuncture, exercise, and ginger may all help reduce nausea and vomiting during cancer treatment. If you try ginger, take 500 to 1000 mg ginger root extract every 4 to 6 hours as needed. Or you can eat 1 teaspoon (5 grams) of crystallized ginger every 2 to 3 hours as needed. Too much ginger can cause hear tburn. Experts evaluating several studies found that medical marijuana relieved nausea and vomiting more than medication. The review included only a small number of studies and patients. Use caution if considering medical marijuana. Further research is needed . Anxiety/ Stress/ Depression Anxiety and depression can be improved in a number of ways . Any of the following approaches may help you to feel better: acupuncture, an 8 -week Mindfulness -based Stress Reduction Program, yoga, art therapy, exercis e, massage therapy, support groups, aromatherapy, dance, journaling, guided imagery, biofeedback, cognitive behavioral therapy, meditation, relaxa tion, and hypnosis. Sleep Problems You will sleep best if you keep naps short during the day, exercise regularly, sleep in a quiet dark room, and go to sleep at the same time each day. This can help you sleep at night when the melatonin that your body produces is at its best level. (Melat onin is a hormone made by the body. It helps regulate sleep). Relaxation, meditation and yoga may increase melatonin and help you sleep better. Cognitive behavioral therapy may also be helpful. See our handout Improving and Maintaining a Healthy Sleep -Wake Cycle for more information . You can use melatonin in supplemental form. Melatonin should not be taken if you have bipolar disease. It can worsen depression for some people. Check with your doctor before taking melatonin if you use other medication that causes drowsiness. Melatonin comes in two forms: an immediate release preparation for individuals having difficulty falling asleep and a sustained release preparation for those having difficulty staying asl eep. The dose ranges from 1 mg to 20 mg taken before you go to bed. Start with a dose of 3 mg before bed time. Consult with your doctor to adjust this dose as needed to treat your sleep problem without causing a hangover the next day. Pain Acupuncture may relieve pain. A study reported in 2010 showed that acupuncture decreased pain, anxiety, depression and fatigue. The Society for Integrative Oncology strongly supports acupuncture for pain. Massage and mind -body therapies may also be very helpful in relieving pain. Exercise helps you stay fit during treatment and reduces pain. Cannabinoids (chemical compou nds in marijuana) may help pain caused by damaged nerves. This condition, called peripheral neuropathy, can be a side effect of some chemotherapy dr ugs. \u00a9 Bob Stockfield, Integrative Ways To Reduce Side Effects Of Breast Cancer Treatment PATIENT HANDOUT 3 University of Wisconsin Integrative Medicine www.fammed.wisc.edu/integrative Lymphedema and Musculoskeletal Issues Lymphedema occurs when extra lymph fluid builds up in body tissues and causes swelling. It can occur in your arm if lymph vessels are blocked, damaged, or re moved by breast cancer surgery. Lymphatic massage and exercise may prevent some degree of lymphedema. They may also prevent or relieve shoulder problems caused by surgery. One study showed that gentle weight lifting twice a week improved lymphedema and i ncreased strength. A small study reported in 2008 found that a cupuncture increased the range of motion in the shoulder and decreased lymphedema and its symptoms of heaviness and tightening . Dermatitis from Radiation Therapy Dermatitis is an inflammation of the skin. It usually involves an itchy pink or red rash. You can apply calendula cream, which is made from an herb, multiple times daily to the skin affected by radiation to help reduce the severity of the dermatitis. This cream can be purchase at a health store or health pharmacy.
