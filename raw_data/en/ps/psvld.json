Abstract Objectives: Most pediatric poisonings have favorable outcomes and are managed in the home by poison control centers utilizing protocols that deem products or substances as nontoxic. We sought to evaluate the validity of protocols for nontoxics. Methods: This is retrospective study in which poison control center case records within a statewide poison control center system during calendar year 2001 were searched for products or substances involved in a pediatric poisoning ingestion and identified in the poison control center nontoxic substance or product list. This was coupled with systematic literature search to ascertain if any significant medical outcomes were associated with ingestion of a nontoxic substance or product. Results: During the 1-year study period, 20,900 pediatric ingestions involving 46 different nontoxic substances or products were analyzed for significant outcomes. Only 6 cases (0.03%) had a potentially serious clinical effect requiring emergency hospital management. The literature search revealed 2326 ingestion cases of nontoxic products from 635,000 citations in 50 different databases. Of these, 28 cases (1.2%) described an effect, although none was described as significant. Conclusions: Poisoning protocols for pediatric ingestions of substances or products we deemed as nontoxic were rarely associated with significant outcomes. However, non-dose-related potentially life-threatening effects are possible. Therefore, use of nontoxic protocols by other health care practitioners for telephone triage or by the public directly requires further study to be valid. Our study suggests that the term nontoxic is misleading and recommends that it be replaced with \"minimally toxic\" as a more appropriate term for identifying the lowest level of risk of toxicity from a substance or product.
