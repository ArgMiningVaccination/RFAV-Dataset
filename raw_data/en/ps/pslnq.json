We are an unconventional health center focused on Foundational Correction (a combination of the NUCCA method with non-surgical spinal decompression using the DRX9000). While traditional chiropractors do a great job at reducing muscle spasm, increasing range of motion, and temporarily alleviating pain - Our Upper Cervical [chiropractor in Colorado Springs CO](/) offer a comprehensive solution to your health concerns relating to the spine and nerve system without ever popping, twisting, or cracking and showing your measured results along the way! Balance Chiropractic IS CHIROPRACTIC RIGHT FOR YOU? BENEFITS The Benefits of Chiropractic Care Every year, millions of people seek out chiropractic adjustments. Most chiropractors do a great job. They usually aim to reduce short term aches and pains by popping, twisting and cracking the spine based off pain, range of motion and tight musculature. At Balance Chiropractic (Upper Cervical Chiropractor Colorado Springs CO), our goal is never to simply increase range motion or temporarily relieve pain. Our ONLY FOCUS is the reduction of Foundational Shifts in your spine. We do so without ever popping, twisting or cracking. Our alternative methods require 4 objective measurements to see whether or not you qualify as a candidate for our care in our office. Briefly, we will shed light on how some of the most common symptoms (AKA secondary conditions) may be due to a Foundational Shift in the spine. Usually the decision to see a traditional chiropractor is obvious - for instance, waking up with a \"crick in your neck\" due to sleeping in an unusual way, or lifting something heavy with improper form. However, when traditional methods fail or only offer short term relief, there are several secondary conditions that often resolve after correcting the primary cause, a Foundational Shift by seeing an upper cervical chiropractor Colorado Springs CO. HISTORY The History of Chiropractic Care The word \" [Chiropractic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiropractic)\" is derived from the Greek words \"cheir\" (hand) and \"praktos\" (done) combined to mean \"done by hand.\" It was chosen by the developer of chiropractic care, Daniel David Palmer. In 1895, D.D. Palmer performed a chiropractic adjustment on a partially deaf janitor, Harvey Lillard, who later reported that his hearing had improved due to the change. D.D. Palmer opened the first chiropractic school two years later, and in the century since, chiropractic professionals have used spinal adjustments to help people prevent and cope with back pain, carpal tunnel, muscle strain, headaches and migraines, and a variety of other physical ailments. Millions of people benefit from the work of Dr. Palmer today. TRAINING What Kind of Training Does a Chiropractor Have? Chiropractic doctors go through a minimum of four years of schooling at a chiropractic college, generally preceded by an undergraduate degree in the basic sciences or several years of experience in a prior relevant health care field. Students of chiropractic care must spend a minimum of at least 4,200 hours with their teacher, and a minimum of 1,000 hours of fully supervised clinical training with an instructor as they learn the appropriate diagnosis and treatment techniques to help heal your body and restore it to its natural, fully functioning state.
