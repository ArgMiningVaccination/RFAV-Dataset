Attachment By -Products 15-44 Attachment 15-47 SOP Manual 15-1 Cleaning and Disinfection 15.1 Introduction The c leaning and disinfection (C&D) of equipment, materials, and premises is done to prevent or mitigate the spread of foreign animal diseases (FADs) during an outbreak . As part of a wider response, this helps to stabilize animal agriculture, the food supply, the economy, and to protect public health and the environment . This s tandard operating procedure (SOP) provides State Animal Health Officials, Animal and Plant Heal th Inspection Service (APHIS) personnel , and Incident Management T eams (IMTs) with guidance on choosing and using optimal C&D methods following a n FAD outbreak in domestic livestock and poultry. Several key APHIS documents complement this SOP and provide further detail when necessary. This SOP references the following APHIS documents: Foreign Animal Disease Preparedness and Response Plan ( FAD PReP)/ National Animal Health Emergency Management System (NAHEMS) Guidelines: Biosecurity C&D Disposal Health and Safety Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Wildlife Man agement and Vector Control FAD PReP SOP s: Biosecurity Disposal Health and Safety & PPE Additional materials may be posted in response to specific disease outbreaks. These documents are available on the APHIS FAD PReP website : www.aphis.usda.gov/fadprep . 15.1.1 Cleaning and Disinfection/Virus Elimination Overview During an FAD outbreak, C&D activities are conducted as a part of regular biosecurity operations (e.g., to disinfect vehicles) as well as to C&D previously infected premises to prevent the spread of disease and move towards restocking. The latter \u2014the C&D of previously infected premises\u2014can also be termed virus elimination. C&D is an effective means of lessening the threat of animal diseases by reducing the presence of pathogenic microorganis ms and prevent ing the spread of disease agents. C&D can involve the use of physical, chemical , or biological processes to remove, inactivate, reduce, or destroy pathogenic microorganisms. Selected C&D methods should account for the physical characteristics of the premises and other factors, such as environmental conditions, which may influence the effectiveness of virus elimination. SOP Manual 15-2 Cleaning and Disinfection 15.1.1.1 Definitions Table 15- 1 lists relevant definitions. Virus elimination refers to the activities that are undertaken after depopu lation and disposal on the premises, to return the premises to a \"free\" status. C&D, on the other hand, can refer to both activities conducted as part of biosecurity operations (including movement controls), as well as the measures that are conducted during virus elimination procedures. Table 1 5-1. Cleaning and Disinfection Definitions Cleaning The removal of gross contamination, organic material, and debris from the premises or respective structures, via mechanical means like sweeping (dry cleaning) and/or the use of water and soap or detergent (wet cleaning). The goal is to minimize organic material so disinfection can be effective. Disinfection Methods used on surfaces to destroy or eliminate a specific species of infectious microorganism through physical (e.g., heat) or chemical (e.g., disinfectant) means. A combination of methods may be required. Virus Elimination C&D measures conducted with the primary purpose to destroy or eliminate all virus es on the premises as cost effectively as possible. 15.1.2 Goals 15.1.2.1 Preparedness Goals The preparedness goals for C&D are as follows : Remove, inactivate, reduce, or destroy viruses on Infected Premises. Conduct C&D/ virus elimination activities in the most cost effective manner possible. Choose appropriate C&D/ virus elimination methods, based on the characteristics of the premises/houses, temperature, and other relevant factors. Conduct timely and effective initial C&D on all areas of the premises that do not have contaminated material (this includes vehicles and equipment), prior to final virus elimination activities on the entire premises. Conduct final virus elimination procedures in a timely manner. 15.1.2.2 Response Goals The response goal s for C&D are as follows: Ensure that C&D is conducted on any premises where a di sease agent is presumed or confirmed to exist within 48 hours of disposal of depopulated animals. Remove, inactivate, reduce, or destroy pathogens at infected premises . 15.1.3 Guidelines Proper C&D is essential to contain the spread of a disease agent and is an i ntegral part of the eradication plan. Pest control must be completed before C&D can commence. Care must be taken to reduce the generation and dispersal of infective dust and aerosols. If items cannot be SOP Manual 15-3 Cleaning and Disinfection adequately cleaned and disinfected, they must be disposed of by other appropriate means determined by the Incident Command. If available personnel or materials are insufficient, Incident Command can request emergency 3D (depopulation, disposal, and decontamination) contractor support from the National Veteri nary Stockpile (NVS). 15.1.4 Coordination Key C&D coordination activities are as follows : Collaborat e within the unified Incident Command personnel to develop an effective C&D strategy, including issues such as environmental conditions (e.g., relative humidity, temperature , and wind) . Determine supply requirements and delivery location, date, and time in collaboration with the Logistics Section . Arrange facility access and determine personnel requirements with the Operations Section . Prepare for and organize personnel supplies , equipment, and daily accommodations (e.g., food, water, and lodging) with the Logistics Section . Establish C&D stations that adhere to biosecurity measures, such as vehicle entry and movement control checkpoints with the Animal Biosecur ity Group. Ensure that C&D and disposal processes are properly conducted with the Disposal Group. Coordinate with the property owner to ensure a smooth process . 15.1.5 Assumed Ongoing or Completed Response Activities These procedures assume the following outbrea k response activities are in progress or have been completed before C&D: Disease confirmation completed/ongoing Movement control ongoing Quarantine ongoing Surveillance ongoing Monitoring, countermeasure use, and vaccination ongoing Biosecurity procedures ongoing Security measures and crowd control completed/ongoing Health and safety proceduresongoing Effluent and runoff control ongoing Appraisal and compensation completed SOP Manual 15-4 Cleaning and Disinfection Depopulationcompleted/ongoing Disposal completed/ongoing. 15.2 Purpose This C&D SOP p rovide s U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) APHIS Veterinary Services (VS) and other official response personnel with operational guidance on cleaning and disinfecting procedures for animal health emergency deployments. The guidance in this SOP is relevant in FAD outbreaks of varying sizes , whether the outbreak is isolated to a single premises or spans across States to multiple premises, because the I ncident C ommand System (ICS) structure from which this SOP is based is both flexible and scalable. These p rocedures serve as guidance for response personnel performing C&D activities. If these procedures conflict with State, Tribal, Territorial, or local laws, regulations, or procedures , always follow the laws within your jurisdiction. 15.3 Responsibilities 15.3.1 Overview The C&D Group is part of the Operations Section (see Figure 15- 1 for an example of the ICS structure ). The C&D Group provides services that are essential to an effective animal health emergency response by helping control and eliminate the disease agent. This section describes the responsibilities of C&D personnel as well as the importance of cooperation with the Disposal , Depopulation, and Appraisal Groups . This SOP also addresses the topics of hazard communication, exercising biosecurity measures, personnel orientation, and needs assessment. The procedures described in this SOP and the FAD PReP/ NAHEMS Guidelines: C&D are pertinent sources of guidance for C&D personnel . Participation in educational sessions and emergency response exercises is recommended to gain additional knowledge of C&D processes, methods, and safety considerations. The Incident Commander oversees all activities (Plannin g, Operations, Finance/ Administration, and Logistics) i n large scale incidents involving multiple premises and covering large areas. C&D activities are coordinated and overseen by the unified Incident Management Team from the Incident Command Post. A fter a C&D Group is established , depending on the incident, the C&D Group Supervisor may deploy one or more C&D t eams to complete response activities. These teams may be either Task Force teams or Strike t eams depending on incident requirements. 15.3.2 Cleaning and D isinfection Personnel Responsibilities In general, the C&D Group is responsible for the following: Providing input on C&D /virus elimination procedures (for example, technical advice, briefings, and daily reports). Providing technical advice on C&D /virus elimination issues to owners or operators of Infected or Contact Premises. SOP Manual 15-5 Cleaning and Disinfection Coordinating closely with the Logistics Section to secure the necessary equipment and supplies. Coordinating C&D t eam activities with other ongoing response activities (such as surveill ance, biosecurity, and disposal . Establishing, operating, and maintaining C&D stations as needed, including quarantined premises, controlled checkpoints for movement and vehicles , and decontamination stations. Providing personnel to supervise C&D /virus elimination activities. Scheduling and certifying C&D /virus elimination procedures on affected premises. For more information on the responsibilities of C&D personnel, and for an overview of general C&D activities, please see the FAD PReP/NAHEMS Guidelines: C&D found at the FAD PReP APHIS website: Structure1 Note: EPI = Epidemiologist , PIO = Public Information Officer. 1 The C& D Group falls under the Operations Section (a part of the Disease Management Branch) within the Incident Command Structure. Incident Commander / Deputy Incident Commander Safety Officer Liaison Officer Public Information Officer Intelligence Officer EPI Safety Coordinator Assistant PIO Planning Section Logistics Section Finance /Admin Section Disease Management Branch Cleaning and Disinfection Group Operations Section SOP Manual 15-6 Cleaning and Disinfection 15.3.3 Cleaning and Disinfection Group Supervisor The C&D Group Supervisor manages the cleaning and disinfecting process for infected premises. R esponsibilities of this individual include directing and supervising all activities of the C&D personnel. A C&D Group Supervisor should have management and C&D experience in past incidents, as well as knowledge of animal disease. This position reports directly to the Operations Section Chief , who oversees all o f the tactical operations of an incident. 15.3.4 Site Manager On a single premises, the S ite M anager is designated as oversight for daily operations and personnel. This individual assists with biosecurity, safety, and is the intermediary between all Groups on- site. The Site Manager is responsible for animal welfare, planning the site timeline, and the coordination of ordering resources. This position maintains communication between the IMT and the property owner regarding operational activity. 15.3.5 Cleaning and Disinf ection Team Leaders and Team Members C&D Team Leaders supervise the on -site activities of the C&D t eam (or C&D teams, depending on the size and needs of the I nfected or Contact P remises). C&D Team Leaders have responsibility for one of the specific C&D functions, such as the individual C&D stations or checkpoints. In a large incident, different C&D Team Leaders may manage the functions of vehicle disinfection stations, equipment , supplies on quarantined premises (which will include on-site coordination w ith the Animal Biosecurity Group), and supervision of premises to be cleaned and disinfected. C&D Team Leaders shall ensure C&D operations are performed in accordance with SOPs and manufacturer's specifications, including temperature requirements . The number of C&D t eam members will depend on the characteristics of the premises (number of buildings, size and separation of buildings, size of the area, sanitary conditions of the premises, and the time frame with which work can or must be completed). The C&D t eam consists of individuals who are experienced and skilled in C&D/virus elimination procedures and familiar with handling cleansers and disinfectants. 15.4 Cleaning and Disinfection /Virus Elimination Planning Before beginning any C&D /virus elimination procedure s, under guidance of the IMT, a situational assessment needs to be performed and a plan established so C&D /virus elimination response can ensure a well -coordinated approach. Proper planning helps to ensure the elimination or reduction of pathogens , prevents further movement of pathogens, and helps to ensure the safety of response personnel, animals, and the environment. It also minimizes the possibility that a lack of resources impedes the C&D /virus elimination process. 15.4.1 Assessment In the assessment p hase, information is gathered to assist with the planning of the C&D /virus elimination response. It includes the following (see Figure 15 -2): 1. Identifyi ng the FAD to be controlled or eliminated. SOP Manual 15-7 Cleaning and Disinfection 2. Conducting a situation assessment . a. conduct a property assessment (location of electricity poles and lines, underground cables, phone lines, fuse box, and meter ); b. identify areas and items requiring specific C& D/virus elimination action ; c. identify any potential ly hazardous situations ; and d. identify the location of drainage s and run off destinations . 3.

In consultation with the owner (producer, agent, or designee) and the Site Manager , a site -speci fic plan is prepared . This plan should also address the details on proper disposal of materials (e.g., gross debris , chemical solutions ) in a manner that minimizes the further spread of microorganism s that is compliant with Federal, State, Tribal, and loca l requirements and law .2 2 USDA APHIS and Center for Food Security and Public Health (CFSPH). (2014). FAD PReP/NAHEMS Guidelines: SOP Manual 15-8 Cleaning and Disinfection 15.4.2.1 Outline A detailed written C&D /virus elimination plan should include the following: A review, design, and setup of the premises. Definition of the area to be cleaned and disinfected. Identification of appropriate locations for the C&D setup and process, and holding areas for: vehicles and heavy equipment , personnel , and small equipment. Selection of Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) approved C&D products to be used. Description of proper C&D methods and processes to include : cleaning, disinfecting , and down time. Personnel requirements and assignments . Materials, supplies, and equipment . Regulatory permits and approvals . Plans for proper disposal of disinfectants and materials. ( See the FAD PReP/ NAHEMS Guidelines: Disposal and t he FAD PReP Disposal SOP ). Quality assurance and quality control . 15.4.2.2 Review, Design, and Setup of the Premises During the assessment phase, sufficient information is gathered to design and setup the premises for effective C&D/virus elimination . This part of the plan should include: 1. Selecting the most appropriate sites to conduct disinfection and decontamination for equipment and personnel. ( See the FAD PReP/ NAHEMS Guidelines: C&D for requirements to select disinfection and decontamination sites) . The chosen location should a. have minimal environmental impact ; and b. have adequate drainage per State, local, Tribal and Federal regulations . 2. Determining a reas on the premises that need C&D /virus elimination . Consider the following, for example, when defining the C&D /virus elimination area: a. Interior and exterior surfaces that need C& D. b. Other structures or items such as fences that need C&D . SOP Manual 15-9 Cleaning and Disinfection c. Potential environmental risks for outdoor disinfection. 3. Designing and setting up the different stations, to include the following : a. Holding areas, Hot Zone /Exclusion Zone (EZ), Warm Zone /Containment Reduction Zone (CRZ), and Cold Zone /Support Zone (SZ) for heavy equipment/ machinery. b. Holding areas, Hot Zone/ EZ, Warm Zone/ CRZ, and Cold Zone/ SZ for small equipment and tools . c. Hot Zone/ EZ, Warm Zone/ CRZ, and Cold Zone /SZ for personnel wash stations (see Figure 15- 3). d. Adequate privacy for personnel cleaning stations . e. Placement of drainage pits, if needed, that are located away from sensitive environmental areas, such as wetlands or wellhead areas. f. Areas for the placement of items for off -site disposal that require further processing such as decontamination and then transport to off -site facilities . g. Placement of items for on -site disposal. Figure 15-3. Biosecurity Control Zones Source: Dani Ausen, Andrew Kingsbury, Iowa State University. 15.4.2.3 Selection of Cleaning and Disinfection Methods The plan should also cover the various C&D/virus elimination methods that apply to that specific site. It must also specify the cleanliness and effectiveness to be achieved and identify the surfaces and structures to undergo C&D/virus elimination. There are different ways to accomplish C&D and a comb ination of methods may be necessary . (See the FAD PReP/ NAHEMS Guideline s: C&D for guidance on choosing a C&D method.) SOP Manual 15-10 Cleaning and Disinfection C&D methods may include steam cleaning or scrubbing by hand; shoveling, vacuuming, or sweeping out bulk materials; the chemical disinfectant to be used and its application (as a gas, liquid, foam, or powder) and whether those materials will be sprayed on; and physical (heat, ultraviolet light, or desiccation). 15.4.2.4 Selection of Proper Disinfectants The requirements of the incident, specifically, the microorganism of concern, disinfection methods , and environmental factors all contribute to the disinfectant selection. USDA APHIS recommends that the selection of the disinfectant and disinfection methodology should be based on EPA -registered labels for antimicrobial pesticides (that is , disinfectants). The label will be registered by the EPA either under Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act ( FIFRA ) Section 3 (regular label) or under FIFRA Section 18 (emergency use label). The disinfectant is used according to its registered label at the indicated dilution, use sites, application method, contact time, and cautionary statement against the pathogens specified on the label. In addition, a registered disinfectant may be used according to label indication against pathogens not listed on the label (under a FIFRA Section 2 [ee] exemption) provided that this use is not in conflict with State or local law . The non- label -listed pathogens should be equally or more sensitive to inactivation by the disinfectant than the heartiest pathogen listed on the registered label. The FAD PReP/ NAHEMS Guidelines: C&D guidance includes recommendations regarding generally accepted disinfection practices.

(Figure 15 -4 displays the susceptibility of different types of microorganisms to chemical disinfectants.) Figure 15-4. Susceptibility of Microorganisms to Chemical Disinfectants Source: Clint May and Andrew Kingsbury, Iowa State University . SOP Manual 15-11 Cleaning and Disinfection If a non- EPA -registered disinfectant is determined to be the most effective, the IMT, Incident Command , or other Animal Health Official, must seek approval to use the non- EPA -registered disinfectant ( see the EPA at: ). Subsection 15.4.2.9 , Regulatory Permits and Approvals , describes the process for obtaining permits for using a non- EPA -registered disinfectant. The EPA has approved the use of disinfection treatments , under the emergency exemption label, for hard, porous and nonporous food and non- food contact surfaces that are at risk of contamination f or foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) , African swine fever virus, low pathogenic avian influenza virus, or highly pathogenic avian influenza virus .3 See the FAD PReP/ NAHEMS Guidelines: C&D for guidance on using the appropriate disinfectant. 15.4.2.5 Personnel Requirements Assessing the premises provid es an understanding of the size and complexity of the C&D process. The number and expertise of the personnel required to conduct C&D depends on the quantity and size of the areas and buildings, the sanitary condition of the premises, and time frame the work is to be performed. The personnel components of the C&D plan must include the following: 1. An estim ate of the required number of C&D personnel based on the size and scope of the job. 2. Identification of C&D members to fill the required amount needed. Use 3D contractors if necessary to fill positions. 3. Identification of specific briefings required before C &D activities, including safety requirements, site conditions, and specific tasks. 4. A determination of briefing frequency. 5. Training and credentialing requirements for C&D members and the verification of credentials, training, and security clearances. a. If necessary, the IMT, and the Operations S ection arranges to provide personnel with just-in-time training. b. All personnel must be trained on basic C&D /virus elimination procedures, safety protocols, and briefed on the specific aspects of the incident. No one wi ll be allowed to enter premises without verified credentials. c. Include training on the safe handling of chemical compounds. d. Discuss means of addressing and mitigating potentially hazardous situations noted during the pre -assessment phase. 6. The specific tasks for which a C&D member is responsible. 3 U.S. EPA. 2016. FIFRA Section 18 Emergency Exemption Label, Citric Acid. Available at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/emergency -management/ct_disinfectants/ . SOP Manual 15-12 Cleaning and Disinfection The IMT works with Operations Section personnel to identify C&D personnel with the required expertise (as identified in the site -specific C&D plan). The IMT advises the Operations Section of any C&D personnel requirements that cannot be satisfied locally so that additional personnel can be assigned. Appropriate officials are also contacted by the IMT to coordinate the issuance of contracts and leases for equipment, supplies, or personnel for C&D oper ations. If appropriate personnel are not readily available, contact the USDA APHIS VS NVS for access to 3D contractors. 15.4.2.6 Personal Protective Equipment Personnel should only don PPE that they have been fully trained, medically cleared to use, and fit tested to wear. It is essential that p ersonnel engaged in C&D wear at the least, coveralls, boots, and gloves. Face protection and a mask should also be worn during the mixing and application of disinfectant solutions, the production of significant amounts of dus t, and the possibility of the presence of a zoonotic disease. Personnel must practice proper personal decontamination and doffing procedures, before leaving an infected premises or any Quarantined area, to prevent the spread of disease organisms. See the Foreign Animal Disease (FAD) Investigation Manual (FAD PReP Manual 4 -0) for PPE donning and doffing guidance .

Be familiar and appropriately prepared to preve nt the various chemical and physical hazards associated with the C&D of premises. (See the FAD PReP/NAHEMS Guidelines: C&D.) 15.4.2.11 Quality Assurance/Quality Control The C&D plan should outline all quality assurance/ quality control metrics , including post C&D evaluation and inspections necessary to comply with the plan; for example, ensure that SOP Manual 15-15 Cleaning and Disinfection all personnel are trained on proper C&D /virus elimination procedures ; all surfaces are cleaned before they are disinfected ; debris is removed and disposed of appropriatel y with visual inspection ; and required disinfectant concentrations and contact times are achieved, and sufficient quantitative verification tests confirm disinfection, if applicable. 15.5 Cleaning and Disinfection /Virus Elimination Procedures The information provided here is for guidance only. The procedures offered below are to provide an example of the procedures that are conducted in response to an FAD outbreak; they do not indicate what will be done in an incident, or exactly what or which procedures will be implemented. In an FAD outbreak, specific guidance will be provided by the unified Incident Command on any C&D/virus elimination procedures. 15.5.1 Overview The material composition (for example, concrete and metal) of an item or structure that requires C&D can impact the type of methods that should be used. ( See FAD PReP/ NAHEMS Guidelines: C&D for more information on the considerations and contraindications .) The specific processes for C&D vary by the item to be cleaned and disinfected and are described below. This SOP includes item -specific C&D processes such as: Respirators (Attachment 15.B and euthanasia handling materials For general C&D, the following steps must be taken: 1. Wear adequate PPE as described in the site- specific health and safety plan during all steps of C&D . (See the FAD PReP Biosecurity and FAD PReP Health and Safety & PPE SOPs .) 2. Select an appropriate disinfection station for small equipment and personnel. (See the FAD PReP/NAHEMS Guidelines: C&D and the FAD PReP Biosecurity SOP for criteria on selecting appropriate disinfection locations.) 3. Remove sensitive equipment. 4. Consult with the Vector Control Group personnel on insect and vector control plans. SOP Manual 15-16 Cleaning and Disinfection a. Remove dead insects and rodents and dispose of according to the site -specific disposal plan; consult with the Disposal Group . (See the FAD PReP Disposal SOP .) b. Eliminate openings where wild animal s and rodents can enter the building. 5. Disconnect utility supplies if described in the plan. Acquire an alternative electric supply as an electrical source for cleaning. 6. Control ventilation to maintain hum an comfort and prevent pathogen dispersion. 7. Seal and disinfect all drains and run offs . 8. Empty all watering and feeding apparatus es, disassembling if appropriate, to facilitate C&D. 9. Conduct the dry cleaning ; wet cleaning ( washing, rinsing , and drying) ; disinfecting (mixing protocol ; wet disinfection ; and heat treatment) ; and downtime protocols as indicated by the unified Incident Command and discussed, as examples, in Subsections 15.5.2.1 to 15.5.4.3 and 15.6.2 . 10. Use a systematic procedure for C&D: a. Always start at the back of the facility and proceed to the front. b. Always begin application on the ceilings and move down the wa lls to the floor, then across the drain. 11. Gather the cleaning and disinfecting equipment (for example, rakes, shovels, scrapers, brushes, trucks, spray/ disinfection devices) and clean and disinfect these items (see Attachment 15.A for C&D equipment and supplies). Reapply disinfectant as needed to keep the surfaces wet for the required contact time. 12. If the facility is fumigated, make the facility airtight after the cleaning and washing steps. 15.5.2 Cleaning Methods Cleaning is one of the most important steps in the C&D process. The cleaning process can be executed as dry cleaning and/or wet cleaning . When done appropriately, cleaning alone can remove over 90 percent of microorganisms.6 15.5.2.1 Dry Cleaning Dry cleaning involve s the removal of any gross contamination and organic material (for example, soil, manure, bedding, and feed) from production areas or equipment. Consideration must be taken in s electing the best time and performing this particular systematic way of cleaning to not aerosolize viruses. Shovels, manure forks, brooms, and brushes should be used to sweep, scrape, and remove organic material and debris from surfaces. Heavy equipment (t ractors or bobcats seen in Figure 15- 5) may also be required to clear away and discard large amounts of bedding and manure. 6 USDA APHIS and CFSPH. (2014). FAD . SOP Manual 15-17 Cleaning and Disinfection The following steps for cleaning are reco mmended : 1. Minimize remaining organic material; in most cases the original surface should be visible on floors, walls, and fans (e.g., wood or metal). Figure 15-5. Heavy Equipment for Dry Cleaning Source: FAD PReP/NAHEMS Guidelines: C&D 2. Refer to the unified Incident Command for guidance on how much organic material is acceptable to leave present on any surface, related to whether or not that surface is accessible to restocked animals. 3. Priority is to ensure all wet organic material is dry or removed. This is likely to be the most recent deposits to the site and thus, the most likely to have infectious material. 4. Ensure all remaining organic material dries; i.e ., if weather has made material damp or wet, allow to dry naturally or remove. Drying is an effective way to destroy/eliminate the virus. 5. Dispose material appropriately, following unified Incident Command instructions . 6. For situations with stored manure or manure pits, State and APHIS officials will make a disposal determination with the IMT. 15.5.2.2 Wet Cleaning Wet cleaning involves the use of water and soap or detergent. Washing Following the removal of gross contamination (dry cleaning), areas or items should be washed with detergent. The washing process helps to further reduce the number of microorganisms and to remove any oil, grease, or exudates that may inhibit the action of disinfection. Washing prior to disinfection is one of the most commonly overlooked steps in the C&D process. SOP Manual 15-18 Cleaning and Disinfection The following steps for washing are recommended : 1. Obtain alternate power supplies if all electrical power will be shut off for washing. 2. Turn off, un plug, and remove or tightly cover any electrical equipment with plastic sheeting. Contact an electrician if necessary. 3. If necessary, use brushes to scrub all contaminated surfaces with water and detergent in accordance with the site -specific plan, ensuring that cleaned areas are free of dirt and debris. Warm water can aid in removing organic debris. Caked -on materials may require prolonged soaking time. 4. Use warm to hot water (90 -130\u00b0F [32 -54\u00b0C] or higher). 5. If surfaces and ambient temperature are below freezing, either heat the surfaces to prevent freezing, use heat blankets around liquid containers, or add up to 40% propylene glycol in water when mixing solutions. 6. Flush, sanitize, and drain all components of the watering and feeding systems. If possible, remove and disassemble these devices to remove organic debris and permit proper cleaning. Flush, sanitize, and drain reservoirs. 7. For ventilation components, individually clean fans, casings, motors, belts, curtains, ventilation pads, and louvers, ensuring the y are free of manure, debris, dust, and dirt before disinfection. Individually wipe, clean, and sanitize equipment such as thermostats, scales, time clocks, electrical panels, switches, and light bulbs and protect them as needed from recontamination during the cleaning process. 8. Dispose of all C&D solutions in accordance with the site- specific disposal plan. Rinsing and Drying After washing, all surfaces should be thoroughly rinsed, as residues from cleaners and detergent can inactivate certain chemical disi nfectants. The following steps for rinsing and drying are recommended : 1. Use clean, cold water that is under low pressure to rinse all contaminated surfaces to remove any remaining dirt, debris, and residue. This is necessary to remove any soap or detergent residue , which if present may inactivate several chemical disinfectant s. 2. If surfaces and ambient temperature are below freezing, either heat the surfaces to prevent freezing, use heat blankets around liquid containers, or add up to 40% propylene glycol in water when mixing solutions. 3. Visually inspect the surface for cleanliness; there should be no \"beading\". Instead , the water should spread evenly over the surface. All surfaces should be free of all foreign matter. 4. Dispose of the rinse water in accordance w ith the site -specific plan. 5. Allow sufficient drying time (overnight) so no free liquids remain on the washed surfaces. SOP Manual 15-19 Cleaning and Disinfection 15.5.3 Evaluation of the Premises after Cleaning Procedures An inspection is conducted after the cleaning of a premises is completed to ensure : Gross debris (for example, manure, unused feed, or bedding) have been removed. All grossly contaminated s urfaces have been identified are sufficiently cleaned prior to disinfection procedures. Any contaminated wood or items difficult to clean have been appraised, removed, and disposed of in a manner that minimizes spread of pathogens (for example, burned, composted, or buried). All fixtures and fittings have been dismantled and cleaned. All infected or suspected areas have been properly washed, rinsed, and dried ; visual inspection should be conducted to ensure surfaces are clean and no organic material has been left behind. Effluent from the cleaning procedures has been handled in a manner to minimize or avoid environmental impact. 15.5.4 Disinfection Methods This SOP provides examples for chemical disinfection methods ; however, heat or ultraviolet radiation are other physical methods of disinfection. In fact, heat treatment was a key method of virus elimination during the 2014-2015 highly pathogenic avian influenza ( HPAI ) outbreak in the United States which is covered in Subsection 15.5.4.3 . For m ore information on heat treatment for virus elimination, see HPAI response guidance available at www.aphis.usda.gov . The method of disinfection will depend on many factors; in any FAD outbreak, the unified Incident Command and National Incident Coordination Group ( ICG) will provide guidance on virus eliminatio n procedures . (See the FAD PReP/ NAHEMS Guidelines: C&D for more detailed information on the different methods of disinfection (physical, soap and detergents, and chemical .) 1. Calculate the total surface area of the floor, ceiling, and walls. Approximately 100-150 square feet of surface area can typically be covered by one gallon of diluted disinfectant , but consult a subject matter expert to ensure the appropriate dilution . 2. Select the appropriate chemical disinfectant ( see the FAD PReP/ NAHEMS Guidelines: C&D on different types of chemical disinfectants) as specified in the site -specific plan. 15.5.4.1 General Disinfectant Mixing Protocol The proper mixing of disinfectant is critical to achieving the right concentration for effective disinfection and the health and s afety of C&D personnel. This section describes a general disinfectant mixing protocol : 1. Wear appropriate PPE when opening and mixing disinfectants. At minimum, wear disposable outwear (for example , coveralls, boots, hat, and gloves). SOP Manual 15-20 Cleaning and Disinfection 2. Ensure that the chemical disinfectant has been stored properly (a cool location is necessary to maximize shelf life) and is within the maximum shelf life before mixing. Check the product label for the expiration date. The shelf life of a disinfectant is not always noted on the l abel. In such situations, if there are concerns about the chemical's effectiveness, use a test kit. Test kits can help determine whether any chemical degradation of the disinfectant's active ingredients has occurred. Some chemical disinfectants come equipped with test kits (Figure 15- 6). Figure 15-6. Test Kits Source: FAD PReP/NAHEMS Guidelines: C&D . 3. Calculate the required amount of disinfectant. For liquid chemical disinfectant solution, calculate the total surface area of the floor, walls, ceiling, and fixed equipment requiring treatment. In general, one gallon of diluted disinfectant usually covers approximately 100-150 sq uare foot of surface area. Use test -kits to ensure that the diluted solution contains the necessary amount of active ingredient. 4. Ensure that the correct proportion of disinfectant concentrate is added to the correct volume of water. 5. If ambient temperature is below freezing, either heat the surfaces to be treated to prevent freezing, use heat blankets around liquid containers, or add up to 40% propylene glycol in water when mixing solutions. 6. Mix the required amount of disinfectant sol ution in accordance with label instructions or FIFRA Section 18 exemption criteria. Always add concentrate to water, not water to concentrate. 7. In cold temperatures, the building may require heating to ensure that the disinfectant is effective; please consu lt with a subject matter expert on disinfectant effectiveness. 8. Once a solution has been prepared, it must be used on the same day or it may become inactive. If there are concerns about the chemical's effectiveness, test kits can help to determine whether any chemical degradation of the disinfectant's active ingredients has occurred. SOP Manual 15-21 Cleaning and Disinfection It may be necessary to maintain a log of the prepared solution ; it is critical in minimizing excess solution preparation and maintaining the efficacy of the disinfectant . For mo re information on the preparation and application of disinfectant , see the FAD PReP/NAHEMS Guidelines: C&D , at www.aphis.usda.gov/fadprep . 15.5.4.2 Wet Disinfection Procedure Apply disinfectant in a pre -cleaned facility from top to bottom and from back to front . The time a disinfectant is in contact with the surface is important and varies with the type of disinfectant. Carefully follow the specific instructions on the disinfectant label. Reapplication of disinfe ctant may be necessary to achieve the product label -indicated contact time. The following steps are recommended for general disinfection: 1. Apply the disinfectant to the contaminated surfaces in accordance with the site- specific plan and product label. 2. If surfaces and ambient temperature are below freezing, either heat the surfaces to prevent freezing, use heat blankets around liquid containers, or add up to 40% propylene glycol in water when mixing solutions. 3. Ensure that the disinfectant has had adequate con tact time as specified on the disinfectant label. Note that the recommended contact time will vary by the type of surface being treated , and reapplication of disinfectant may be necessary to achieve the product label -indicated contact time. (See the FAD PReP/ NAHEMS Guidelines: C&D on Material Composition for more information .) 4. Compl etely rinse the chemical disinfectant with water, as it can likely cause harm to animals. Allow surfaces to thoroughly air dry before utilizing the area . 5. Ensure that any unused disinfectant concentrate and solution are either stored in accordance with the label instructions and the site -specific health and safety plan or properly disposed. 15.5.4.3 Using Heat Treatment for Virus Elimination Cleaning followed by th e application of wet disinfectant has been the common practice used to eliminate viruses on infected premises, such as HPAI . However, specifically for HPAI, dry cleaning and heating of houses /barns (also cal led heat treatment) was demonstrated as a cost - effective option as an accepted method of disinfection/ virus elimination in recent HPAI outbreaks in the United States. Any disinfectant method(s) selected should consider the characteristics of the premises/houses and other factors which may impact the eff ectiveness of the virus elimination activities. Heat treatment may not be appropriate in all situations. The C&D/virus elimination options selected and implemented must be included as part of the approved C&D plan and approved by State Animal Health Offici als and APHIS. Heating barns/houses that have been dry cleaned is often the most eff icient way to disinfect infected premises and destroy/eliminate virus es (e.g. , HPAI) . Current policy guidance (Figure SOP Manual 15-22 Cleaning and Disinfection 15-7), for HPAI only, states that barns/houses must be heated to between 100\u00b0F and 120\u00b0F for a total of 7 days; with at least 3 consecutive days (of the 7 days) of heating continuously to within this temperature range. To avoid damage to structures and fixtures, t emperatures should not exceed 120\u00baF. Figure 15-7. Drying and Heating Specifications See Figure 15 -8 for two example s of a successful heat treatment that fulfills these requirements. Figure 15-8. Example of Successful Heat Treatment 1. For the first examp le in Figure 15- 8, the premises is able to maintain the barn at the specified temperature (between 100\u00b0F and 120\u00b0F) for 7 straight days . This f ulfills the requirement for a total of 7 days at temperature , as well as 3 consecutive days at temperature . 2. In the second example, a heater breaks down at the same time the premises experiences severe cold weather temperatures. This premises is able to repair the heater quickly , but the temperature in the barn drops below 100\u00b0F for 2 days. In this case, the premises must heat the barn for a longer period of time to fulfill the requirement of 7 total days at temperature, with 3 consecutive days at temperature. Howe ver, the premises can count the first day at temperature towards the 7 total day requirement. If a premises cannot meet the 7 day total requirement (between 100 and 120\u00b0F) , in addition to the 3 consecutive day requirement at temperature for an extended period of time (greate r than 2 weeks or as recommended by Incident Command), the premises may need to consider an alternative means of disinfection, in discussion with State and APHIS officials. For further information, see HPAI response guidance available at www.aphis.usda.gov on virus elimination and heat treatment. 15.5.5 Procedures for Items Unable to be Cleaned and Disinfected As previously mentioned , most items found in animal production situations (for example , wood, insulation, feed, and bedding) cannot be properly cleaned and disinfected. Special C&D End Heat TreatmentEnd Heat 95\u00b0F 95\u00b0F 100\u00b0F 110\u00b0F 115\u00b0F 110\u00b0F Example 2: Day 1 Day 2 Day 3 Day 4 Day 5 Day 6 Day 7 100\u00b0F 100\u00b0F 110\u00b0F 100\u00b0F Begin Heat Treatment SOP Manual 15-23 Cleaning and Disinfection considerations for specific materials can be found in the FAD PReP/NAHEMS Guidelines: C&D . Items identified for disposal must be disposed according to the disposal plan. ( See the FAD PReP/ NAHEMS Guidelines: Disposal and the FAD PReP Disposal SOP .) 15.5.6 Procedures for Premises Unable to be Cleaned and Disinfected If a premises cannot be cleaned and disi nfected, fallowing is recommended for 120- days or a period advised by the unified Incident Command. The fluctuation of temperature and season will affect this length of time suggested. Typically, f allowing should be reserved for premises that would need to be completely repaired or destroyed in order to be effectively cleaned and disinfected. However, there also may be production types/situations that do not allow for effective C&D. An inspection may be required by the State Animal Health Official or APHIS at the end of the fallow period. 15.5.7 Disposal The s ite-specifi c disposal plan describes disposal options suitable for the specific site. Not all disposal options are appropriate for every type of waste generated. C&D personnel should coordinate with the Disposal Group on the proper way to dispose of disinfectant solutions , pesticides, and other waste items resulting from the C&D process and from C&D supplies to bedding, feed, and manure . Solid waste rules must be used to classify these materials. Disposal of Disinfectants (Concentrate and Waste) Any small amount of unused waste disi nfectant concentrate should be disposed of according to the label instructions. Consult a qualified waste disposal professional for the disposal of larger quantities of disinfectant concentrate. No special procedures of disposal are required for small quantities of waste disinfectant solution resulting from excess spray and runoff. Large amounts of waste disinfectant must be collected, tested, characterized, and disposed of by the appropriate jurisdiction. If possible, it can be filtered and reused. Disposa l of Pesticides The services of a licensed pesticide applicator should be obtained for pesticide use, in accordance with State law . The local authority solid waste management can provide guidance on the appropriate disposal process for pesticide waste. Disposal of Solid Waste Treat C&D supplies (e.g. , towels and mops) as debris and properly disinfect them before removal from premises. R endering is generally n ot applicable for manure, bedding, or feed; however, onsite composting can meet the needs of disposal for these materials as long as the site is suitable. If not, these materials will have to be securely transported to a permitted landfill, or disposed by one of the following options: regional composting, fixed incineration, open burning, unlined burial, or mobile technologies . See the FAD PReP/ NAHEMS Guidelines: Disposal and the FAD PReP Disposal SOP for additional guidance on disposal procedures for disinfectants, pesticides, and solid waste available on the APHIS FAD PReP website: www.aphis.usda.gov/fadprep . SOP Manual 15-24 Cleaning and Disinfection 15.6 Post Cleaning and Disinfection 15.6.1 Evaluation of the Premises after Disinfection Procedures Following the disinfection of premises and equipment, an inspection should be conducted (by individual as designated by the unified Incident Command) to ensure that appropriate disinfection has been completed successfully. If there is any doubt or sign of inadequate procedures, additional measures may be required. The evaluation assesses and confirm s that the following have taken place: All grossly contaminated areas have been identified and properly disinfected with an appropriate disinfectant. All personnel are aware of disinfection measures and implement them for themselves and their equi pment ( e.g., PPE, tools, and instruments). Any contaminated wood or items difficult to disinfect have been appraised, removed, and disposed of in a manner that minimizes spread of pathogens ( e.g., burned, composted, or buried). All fixtures and fittings ha ve been disinfected. All infected or suspected areas have been properly disinfected. An EPA -registered or exempted disinfectant that is effective against the target microorganism was used at the appropriate concentration. The necessary contact time of the disinfectant was permitted. Effluent from the disinfection procedures has been handled in a manner to minimize or avoid environmental impact. For further information on premises evaluation elements , see the FAD PReP/NAHEMS Guidelines: C&D found at www.aphis.usda.gov/fadprep . 15.6.2 Downtime In accordance with response plans and to verify that C& D is complete, the premises must have had adequate downtime prior to being restocked, regardless of the type of disinfection/virus elimination procedures that are conducted. Take the following steps for downtime procedures: 1. As soon as the premises has been certified as clean and disinfected by the unified Incident Command, downtime may begin. 2. Diagnostic testing may be required depending on the disease agent; the unified Incident Command will provide guidance on restock testing. SOP Manual 15-25 Cleaning and Disinfection Attachment 15.

SOP Manual 15-26 Cleaning and Disinfection Attachment 15.B Cleaning and Disinfecting Respirators Respirators, if properly cleaned and disinfected, may be used as PPE again. Procedures for cleaning and disinfecting half and full respirators are detailed below . For more information on respiratory protection C&D , consult with the Safety Officer at the IMT , as well as the Safety, Health, and Environmental Protection Branch of the Emergency Management, Safety, and Security Division. Respirators must be cleaned after each use. General Information 1. The process shoul d always include these steps: a. Cleaning b. Disinfecting c. Rinsing d. Drying e. Reassembly f. Inspection and testing prior to use. 2. Respirators should be cleaned and disinfected in a way that does not damage the respirator or cause injury to personnel. Procedures These procedures are based on Occupational Safety and Health Administration 7 guidelines:8 A. Remove filters, cartridges, or canisters. Disassemble face pieces by removing speaking diaphragms, demand and pressure -demand valve assemblies, hoses, or any components recommended by the manufacturer. Discard or repair any defective parts. B. Wash components in warm (43 \u00b0C [110 \u00b0F] maximum) water with a mild detergent or with a cleaner recommended by the manufacturer. A stiff bristle (not wire) brush may be used to facilitate the removal of dirt. C. Rinse components thoroughly in clean, warm (43 \u00b0C [110 \u00b0F] maximum), preferably running water. Drain. 7 8 U.S. Department of Labor \u2014Occupational Safety and Health Administration. (1998). In Appendix B -2 to \u00a7 1910.134: Respirator Cleaning Procedures (Mandatory) .

When the cleaner used does not contain a disinfecting agent, respirator components should be immersed for two minutes in one of the following: 1. Hypochlorite solution (50 ppm of chlorine) made by adding approximately one milliliter of laundry bleach to one liter of wate r at 43 \u00b0C (110 \u00b0F); or, 2. Aqueous solution of iodine (50 ppm iodine) made by adding approximately 0.8 milliliters of tincture of iodine (6 -8 grams ammonium and/or potassium iodide/100 cc of 45% alcohol) to one liter of water at 43 \u00b0C (110 \u00b0F); or, 3. Other commercially available cleansers of equivalent disinfectant quality when used as directed, if their use is recommended or approved by the respirator manufacturer. E. Rinse components thoroughly in clean, warm (43 \u00b0C [110 \u00b0F] maximum), preferably runn ing water. Drain. The importance of thorough rinsing cannot be overemphasized. Detergents or disinfectants that dry on face pieces may result in dermatitis. In addition, some disinfectants may cause deterioration of rubber or corrosion of metal parts if not completely removed. F. Components should be hand-dried with a clean lint -free cloth or air - dried. G. Reassemble face piece, replacing filters, cartridges, and canisters where necessary. H. Test the respirator to ensure that all components work properl y. SOP Manual 15-28 Cleaning and Disinfection Attachment 15. C Disinfecting Slurry Pits Slurry pits contain liquid manure (or slurry), a combination of feces, urine, fresh rainwater and runoff, cleaning materials, and bedding materials. Different methods of rendering pathogens inactive within a slurry pit exist ; however, the most practicable in the event of a n outbreak is the use of chemical processes. Refer to the unified Incident Command and the N ational ICG for further guidance on disinfecting slurry pits . Planning 1. Assess the capacity of the slurry pit. 2. Acquire mobile high -performance stirring equipment. Guidelines 1. Exercise appropriate safety precautions. Consider the following: a. Noxious fumes such as carbon monoxide , carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulphide, ammonia , and methane may be released with mixing. b. Always have a minimum of two personnel engaged in mixing or preparing the tanks, never one person working alone. c. The area must be well ventilated. d. Personnel should wear respirators, safety harnesses, and a lifeline. e. Slurry must not be less than 30 cm from the top of the tank. f. Never trust the \"crust\" on top of a tank to take weight. 2. No fresh slurry must be added to slurry pits undergoing disinfection. 3. Store slurry for at least 60 days in the summer and 90 days in the winter before application on pasture. 4. Do not allow animals to graze for a minimum of 30 days after slurry application. Procedures for Disinfecting Slurry Pits9 1. Examine the slurry pit and determine the amount of remaining space. a. The slurry pit should not be at maximum capacity to allow for the addition of chemical products for disinfection. b. If the slurry pit is at maximum capacity, dig an alternative pit and line with plastic sheeting. Pump the slurry into the new pit for treatment. 9 Haas, B., Ahl, R., Bohm, R., & Strauch, D. (1995). Inactivation of viruses in liquid manure. Scientific and Technical Review of the Office International des Epizooties , 14(2), 435445. Retrieved from http://www.oie.int/doc/ged/D8958.PDF . SOP Manual 15-29 Cleaning and Disinfection 2. Vigorously stir the pit. 3. Add the chem ical disinfectant. a. The chemicals should alter the pH to less than 2.0 or to greater than 11.0. b. Ensure that the chemical disinfectant is properly distributed throughout the slurry pit. c. Vigorously stir the chemicals in the pit for a minimum of 6 hours after application and on a daily basis for a minimum of 2 hours per day until the manure is considered safe. d. Maintain at the required pH for a minimum of 7 days. e. Readjust pH so waste is not classified as a R esource C onservation and R ecovery A ct hazardous waste (e.g., pH below 2.0 or above 12.5) when disposed. SOP Manual 15-30 Cleaning and Disinfection Attachment 15. D Disinfecting Biohazardous Material Prior to Disposal10 Some biohazardous materials, such as sharps and unused vaccines, must be appropriately disinfected prior to disposal. Decontamination is necessary to render an article safe for either reuse or disposal. The majority of biohazardous material is disinfected for the purposes of safe disposal and not reuse. Some biohazardous materials cannot achieve disinfection but only sanitization. Treating these types of biohazardous materials can occur under these scenarios: 1. Professional biohazardous materials collection and processing is not available. 2. To limit the crossing of biosecurity lines under vaccination to kill scenarios, biohazardous materi als must be disinfected on premises. 3. The site -specific disposal plan does not recommend or permit the thermal method for these biohazardous materials. Planning 1. Determine whether the biohazardous materials, or which biohazardous materials, will be disposed on the premises or off site. 2. Obtain the required equipment to disinfect biohazardous materials such as : a. autoclaves and autoclave bags and b. PPE for operators. 3. Identify adequately trained personnel to operate the autoclave. 4. Check the equipment to ensure that it is properly operating. Operations for Autoclaving Autoclaving biohazardous materials is an adequate means of physical decontamination to render an article safe for disposal. The autoclaving process involves pressurized steam sterilization at 15 pounds per square inch (PSI) (1.05 kg/cm 2), to achieve a chamber temperature of at least 121\u00baC (250\u00baF), which is effective at inactivating microorganisms. Autoclaving also is appropriate for disinfecting materials for reuse. However, following a FAD outbreak, autoclaving will be used for decontaminating items prior to disposal. Procedures for autoclaving biohazardous materials are described below; however, an autoclave may not be readily available. If autoclaving is not an option, the sharps container must be treated as a fomite and handle d accordingly. 10 USDA. (2009). USDA Policies and Proced ures on Biohazardous Waste Decontamination, Management, and Quality Controls at Laboratories and Technical Facilities. In Departmental Regulation Number: 9630 -001. Retrieved from https://www.ocio.usda.gov/sites/default/files/docs/2012/DR9630 -001_0.htm . SOP Manual 15-31 Cleaning and Disinfection Procedures 1. Retrieve the contaminated biohazardous materials at the autoclaving site. These items should ha ve already been set aside in their proper locations. 2. Carry the contaminated materials to the autoclave in closed, leak -proof containers (autoclave bags). 3. Place the autoclave bags in polypropylene or stainless steel pans. 4. Ensure that the autoclave bags are loosely closed. This is necessary to allow steam to penetrate into the bag to maximize the decontamination. 5. Add water to the material (250 -500 ml) to facilitate heat transfer of the material being decontaminated only if doing so does not facilitate the rel ease of potentially infectious material from the bag. 6. Load and start the process. 7. The process begins when the autoclave has reached 121 \u00b0C (250\u00b0F) and 15 PSI. a. 90 minutes are recommended for the decontamination of waste in low -sided polypropylene containers with bags half-filled and loosely gathered. b. 120 minutes are recommended for tightly packed bags. c. See Table 15.G -1 for EPA recommended processing times. 8. After the cycle is complete, allow the pressure in the autoclave chamber to return to zero. 9. Ensure the p ressure in the autoclave chamber has returned to zero. 10. Slowly open the autoclave door (remain behind the door) and allow the steam to gradually escape. 11. Allow materials inside the autoclave to cool for 15 -30 minutes. 12. Operator must don appropriate PPE. 13. Remove the item from the autoclave. 14. Place the now decontaminated bagged items in the Cold Zone -SZ for off- site disposal at a landfill. (See the FAD PReP Disposal SOP .) Table 15.G -1.

E Cleaning and Disinfecting Vehicles and Heavy Machinery All vehicles (for example , cars, livestock carriers, feed trucks, milk trucks, and carcass transporters) and heavy machinery (for example , excavators, backhoes, and bulldozers) that have been used on infected premises must undergo proper C&D processes before departing the premises because of the potential to transport pathogens across premises. The cargo space of animal transport vehicles specifically need to undergo comprehensive C&D between animal loads as well . See the FAD PReP/NAHEMS Guidelines: C&D and Biosecurity for more det ails on the C&D of vehicles and heavy machinery. For additional information on cleaning and disinfecting vehicles and heavy machinery, refer to the unified Incident Command for guidance. Planning 1. Establish a large- scale disinfection station. ( See the FAD PReP/ NAHEMS Guidelines: C&D on site selection for guidance on choosing the appropriate location. ) 2. Establish a holding area where disinfected vehicles can remain during the necessary disinfectant contact time. 3. Set up the disinfection station to contain spent fluids and debris from vehicles and heavy equipment, potentially by using berming materials (such as sand bags and straw bales). A pump may be used efficiently to collect drainage from C&D procedures into a holding tank. This washing and disinfection station should be large and strong enough to accommodate vehicles and heavy equipment : a. The area should be made at least twice as big as the largest vehicle to allow adequate working room for the C&D personnel. b. Place plywood sheeting on top of the material or the construction of ramps to protect the berms at the entrances and exits. General Procedures 1. Don appropriate PPE such as rubber gloves and eye protection. 2. Remove the following items and set these items aside for C&D: a. Equipment in the truck bed or trai ler, or in the vehicle's trunk . b. Fixtures and fittings. Cleaning Procedures 1. Dispose of soiled bedding and refuse. 2. Use shovels, manure forks, brushes, low-pressure sprayers, or mechanical scrapers to remove all visible organic material from the exterior of the vehicle . Remove any deposits of mud and straw from the wheels, wheel wells, tires, mudguards, and exposed chassis of SOP Manual 15-33 Cleaning and Disinfection the vehicle. Wheels and wheel wells can be a particular fomite that requires detailed attention to ensure proper C&D . It is essential t hat appropriate PPE be worn, especially when zoonotic disease agents are involved. Washing Procedures 1. Use detergent and warm water (90 \u00b0F-130\u00b0F) to wash the vehicle and removed items. Any deposits of mud and straw should be removed from the wheels, wheel we lls, tires, mudguards, and exposed chassis of the vehicle. 2. Pre-soak items with debris that is difficult to remove with simple washing in detergent and warm water. 3. Rinse the vehicle in cold water. If that is not possible, allow the vehicle to sit for 5-10 minutes and allow the residual rinse water to drip off. 4. If surfaces and ambient temperature are below freezing, either heat the surfaces to prevent freezing, use heat blankets around liquid containers, or add up to 40% propylene glycol in water when mixing solutions. Exterior Disinfection 1. Select the appropriate disinfectant (S ee the U.S. EPA -approved l ist.) 2. For vehicles and trailers , apply the disinfectant to the exterior of the vehicle, including the bodywork, wheels, and undercarriage . Figure 15.H -1 depicts responders disinfecting farm equipment. 3. Spray all areas, including the wheels, wheel wells, tires, mudguards, and exposed chass is of the vehicle with a non -corrosive disinfectant. 4. Allow ample wet disinfectant contact time according to label directions with the vehicle or trailer, rinse, and allow to dry thoroughly. Figure 15.H-1. Washing Heavy Machinery Source : Tegwin Taylor, Iowa State University. SOP Manual 15-34 Cleaning and Disinfection Interior Cleaning and Disinfection Interior disinfection of the vehicle is necessary if the driver leaves the cab. If so, all surfaces on the interior of the cab will need to be disinfected. 1. Remove all non- fixed item s from the vehicle to be cleaned and disinfected. 2. Sweep and brush away any debris or mud from the cab's interior. 3. Wash and r inse the interior thoroughly, including floor mats. 4. A holding area can be used for vehicles to stay during the required disinfectant contact time. 5. Gather the C&D equipment (for example rakes, shovels, scrapers, brushes, trucks, manure spreaders, bucket loaders, and spray and disinfection devices) and clean and disinfect these items. Store in a secure location. Documentation Documentati on is critical for tracking C&D procedures conducted for vehicles and heavy machinery. Log sheets should be used and stored in a logbook to record dates of C&D completion and all disinfectant information (type, quantity, preparation date, etc.). All entries on log sheets should be written in ink, signed, and dated. One single line should be drawn through any errors made on a log sheet and then initialed and dated by the originator . Log sheets should not be removed from a logbook. SOP Manual 15-35 Cleaning and Disinfection Attachment 15. F Cleaning and Disinfecting Electronic and Euthanasia Equipment Some items may be difficult to clean and disinfect. Have these items appraised and then discard them. Setup 1. Prepare the disinfectant. The disinfectant should be on the EPA -approve d list of disinfectants . 2. If surfaces and ambient temperature are below freezing, either heat the surfaces to prevent freezing, use heat blankets around liquid containers, or add up to 40% propylene glycol in water when mixing solutions. 3. Identify a disinfectant station for small equipment. The site should be near the entrance or exit points. The ideal site will be in proximity to a water supply and drainage. 4. Setup the C&D station on an impermeable surface (for example , plastic sheeting). Procedures Small Electronic Equipment 1. Dismantle if it is easily disassembled and reassembled. 2. Ensure that the selected disinfectant does not damage or corrode the equipment. 3. If the electrical equipment is airtight, it may be safely cleaned and disinfected by wiping it down with disinfectant or gently spraying with an appropriate disinfectant solution. The most practical method involves placing the equipment inside an airtight e nclosure ( for example, plastic sheeting) for fumigation. 4. If the small handheld equipment has been used inside a Quarantine Zone and has been protected inside a plastic bag a. wipe down the protective plastic bags with disinfectant b. wipe the body of the equipm ent with disinfectant , and c. discard the plastic bag. Equipment Used to Euthanize Livestock Equipment such as captive -bolt guns and firearms are considered to be grossly contaminated. They need to be appropriately and regularly cleaned for the equipment to be in proper working order and safely decontaminated for the next user . Refer to unified Incident Command guidance for steps and frequency need ed to properly C&D euthanasia equipment. In general, be aware of the following: 1. Equipment must be dry cleaned reg ularly to remove gross contaminants . 2. Consult the euthanizing equipment manufacturer's guidelines and disinfect according to the product label. Captive bolt devices often have specific guidance for dismantling and SOP Manual 15-36 Cleaning and Disinfection disinfecting the bolt apparatus, including procedures for operator safety and types of disinfectant and oil to be used for cleaning. 3. Failure to regularly clean and disinfect euthanizing equipment can cause poor performance and present a danger to operators. SOP Manual 15-37 Cleaning and Disinfection Attachment 15.

J Foot -and- Mouth Disease Animal By-Products Hay, Bedding , and Feed Some of the most contagious livestock diseases, such as foot -and-mouth ( FMD ), can survive for extended periods of time under the right climatic and environmental conditions and are transmissible on fomites. The FMD virus (FMDV) survives at 4\u00b0C for 2 months on wool, 2-3 months on feces or slurry, and reportedly can survive for more than 6 months on soil surface under snow.15 Items such as hay, bedding, and animal feed can be a considerable source of infection and will likely be disposed after they have been treated with a disinfectant. ( For more information, see the FAD PReP Disposal SOP .) 1. Treat the hay, bedding, and feed with an EPA -approve d disinfectant for treating the FMDV. 2. Allow appropriate contact time . 3. Prepare the items for disposal. ( See the FAD PReP Disposal SOP .) Wool16 Because the FMDV is transmissible via fomite s, wool must be properly treated to prevent disease spread. Wool harvested from animals infected with FMD can harbor the virus for weeks depending on temperature and humidity levels. Viruses present in wool can be inactivated through industrial washing, chemical depilation, fumigation, industrial scouring, or storage. Industrial Washing Immerse the wool in a series of baths of water, soap , and sodium hydroxide (soda) or potassium hydroxide (potash). Chemical Depilation Use a depilatory consisting of slaked lime of sodium sulphide. Fumigation 1. Add formaldehyde . 2. Hermetically seal the chamber for at least 24 hours. 15 Bartley, L.M., Donnelly, C.A., & Anderson, R.M. (2002). Review of foot -and-mouth disease virus survival in animal excretions and on fomites.
