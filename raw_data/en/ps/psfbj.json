In our studies, we found that these widely used techniques had several technical limitations that have precluded a complete picture of antigen trafficking or retention across lymph node cell types. To address these limitations, we developed a 'molecular tracking device' to follow the distribution, acquisition, and retention of antigen in the lymph node. Utilizing an antigen conjugated to a nuclease-resistant DNA tag, acting as a combined antigen-adjuvant conjugate, and single-cell mRNA sequencing, we quantified antigen abundance in the lymph node. Variable antigen levels enabled the identification of caveolar endocytosis as a mechanism of antigen acquisition or retention in lymphatic endothelial cells. Thus, these molecular tracking devices enable new approaches to study dynamic tissue dissemination of antigen-adjuvant conjugates and identify new mechanisms of antigen acquisition and retention at cellular resolution in vivo. eLife digest The lymphatic system is a network of ducts that transports fluid, proteins, and immune cells from different organs around the body. Lymph nodes provide pit stops at hundreds of points along this network where immune cells reside, and lymph fluid can be filtered and cleaned. When pathogens, such as viruses or bacteria, enter the body during an infection, fragments of their proteins can get swept into the lymph nodes. These pathogenic proteins or protein fragments activate resident immune cells and kickstart the immune response. Vaccines are designed to mimic this process by introducing isolated pathogenic proteins in a controlled way to stimulate similar immune reactions in lymph nodes. Once an infection has been cleared by the immune system, or a vaccination has triggered the immune system, most pathogenic proteins get cleared away. However, a small number of pathogenic proteins remain in the lymph nodes to enable immune cells to respond more strongly and quickly the next time they see the same pathogen. Yet it is largely unclear how much protein remains for training and how or where it is all stored. Current techniques are not sensitive or long-lived enough to accurately detect and track these small protein deposits over time. Walsh, Sheridan, Lucas, et al. have addressed this problem by developing biological tags that can be attached to the pathogenic proteins so they can be traced. These tags were designed so the body cannot easily break them down, helping them last as long as the proteins they are attached to. Walsh, Sheridan, Lucas et al. tested whether vaccinating mice with the tagged proteins allowed the proteins to be tracked. The method they used was designed to identify individual cell types based on their genetic information along with the tag. This allowed them to accurately map the complex network of cells involved in storing and retrieving archived protein fragments, as well as those involved in training new immune cells to recognize them. These results provide important insights into the protein archiving system that is involved in enhancing immune memory. This may help guide the development of new vaccination strategies that can manipulate how proteins are archived to establish more durable immune protection. The biological tags developed could also be used to track therapeutic proteins, allowing scientists to determine how long cancer drugs, antibody therapies or COVID19 anti-viral agents remain in the body. This information could then be used by doctors to plan specific and personalized treatment timetables for patients. Introduction Depending on the route of infection, vaccination mode, and ability of antigens to traffic, different dendritic cell (DC) subsets are required to initiate T cell priming. Upon subcutaneous immunization, small soluble proteins and virus particles pass through the lymphatics to the lymph node (LN), where LN-resident DCs acquire and present antigen ( [Manolova al., [Gerner et al., 2017](#bib26)). For larger antigens and/or pathogens that are too large to pass through the lymphatic capillaries, dermal DCs migrate to the LN for presentation of processed antigens to naive T cells ( [Manolova et et al., 2006](#bib9); [Hampton and Chtanova, 2019](#bib29)). Most adaptive immune responses require antigen processing and presentation by conventional DCs in either the draining LN or at the site of infection or vaccination (migratory cutaneous or dermal DCs) ( [Eisenbarth, 2019](#bib19)). Previous studies have shown that viral antigens persist in the LN beyond the time frame of infectious virus ( [Jelley-Gibbs et al., 2005](#bib39); [Kim et 2006](#bib95)). found that lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) store antigens from viral infection and [Kedl et [Kedl and Tamburini, 2015](#bib45); 2014](#bib81)). Using a vaccine formulation that elicits robust cell-mediated immunity comprising antigen, a Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonist, and an agonistic CD40 antibody et 2012](#bib80)), antigens were in et al., 2014](#bib81)). Antigen storage was dependent on the presence of a TLR agonist (e.g. polyI:C alone [TLR3/MDA5/RIGI or Pam3cys (TLR1/2)+ agonist (e.g. 3M019 [TLR7]) [ al., 2014](#bib81)]. We named this process 'antigen archiving' and showed it is important to poise memory T cells for future antigenic encounters ( [Tamburini et al., 2014](#bib81)). Prior to these studies, the only non-hematopoietic cell type thought to retain antigens were follicular DCs, which harbor antigens in antigen-antibody complexes for extended periods of time and for the benefit of B cell memory ( [Zammit et al., 2006](#bib95); [Heesters et al., 2013](#bib31)). Fibroblasts and non-endothelial stromal cells (SCs) comprise a large portion of the LN stroma and are capable of presenting peripheral tissue antigens, but their capacity to acquire and present foreign antigens is not yet well understood ( [Fletcher et al., 2010](#bib22); [Fletcher et al., 2011](#bib23); [Turley et al., 2010](#bib85)). We were unable to detect antigen archiving by blood endothelial cells (BECs) or fibroblasts in our 2017](#bib44); [Kedl and Tamburini, 2015](#bib45)). While LECs have been shown to present antigens in the absence of inflammation to induce T cell tolerance ( [Cohen et al., 2010](#bib14); [Cohen et al., 2014](#bib36); [Lund et al., 2012](#bib56)), we showed that presentation of archived antigen occurs only after exchange of the archived antigen from an LEC to a migratory DC; changing the stimulus from tolerizing to antigens are exchanged via two distinct mechanisms: (i) direct exchange between LECs and migratory DCs and (ii) LEC death. Antigen transfer from LECs to both migratory conventional (c)DC1s and cDC2s is required for archived antigen presentation to antigen-specific memory T cells ( [Kedl et al., 2017](#bib44); [Kedl and Tamburini, 2015](#bib45)). After infection, archived antigen is transferred to Batf3-dependent migratory DCs as a result of LEC death during LN contraction ( [Kedl et al., 2017](#bib44)). Limitations of current approaches have precluded sensitive and quantitative measures of antigen levels across cell types, providing only a glimpse of the cell types and molecular mechanisms that control antigen acquisition, processing, and retention in the LN. Studies of antigen in the LN and peripheral tissues have mainly relied on antigen-fluorophore conjugates or indirect measurement of antigen uptake and presentation ( [Gerner et al., 2017](#bib26); [Jelley-Gibbs et al., 2014](#bib81); [Jelley-Gibbs et al., 2007](#bib40)), which defined antigen acquisition by specific DC subsets and trafficking of antigens using live imaging ( [Gerner et al., 2017](#bib26)). However, antigen archiving has been difficult to study because antigen-fluorophore conjugates suffer from low microscopic detection sensitivity, yielding weak signals that diminish over time. Moreover, detection of antigen in the LN and other tissues has relied on flow cytometric analysis using cell surface markers, restricting analysis to specific cell types. To address these limitations and better understand antigen archiving, we developed a new approach to track an antigen-phosphorothioate DNA. The phosphorothioate DNA contained a tracking device for detection using single-cell mRNA sequencing and initiated a robust immune response when conjugated to the protein antigen. Here, we outline the tissue distribution in vivo of this antigen-DNA conjugate by utilizing the conjugated phosphorothioate DNA as an adjuvant and tracking device. Results Generation, validation, and immunogenicity of antigen-DNA conjugates To quantify the dissemination and uptake of antigen in the draining LN after vaccination, we developed a vaccination strategy to measure antigen levels using single-cell mRNA sequencing. Many prior studies have used the model antigen, ovalbumin (ova), conjugated to a fluorophore to track antigen in vivo. Here, we conjugated ova to DNA oligonucleotides with [Figure 1a](#fig1)). The ~60 contains a unique sequence barcode and PCR primer binding sites, similar to CITE-seq [Stoeckius et al., 2017](#bib78); [Figure 1\u2014source data the stability of unconjugated DNA and ova-DNA conjugates in which the conjugated DNA either had normal phosphodiester linkages (pDNA) or was protected throughout by phosphorothioate linkages (psDNA). Quality control of these conjugates indicated a 1:1 stoichiometry of protein to DNA ( [Figure 1b](#fig1)). To measure the stability of the antigen-DNA conjugate, we added antigen-DNA conjugates to cultures of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) and quantified the amount of DNA in cell lysates and media over time using the PCR handle to detect the DNA by quantitative PCR. Amount of DNA was quantified as a ratio of DNA detected relative to the amount of protein acquired from the cell lysate. We found significantly higher levels of ova-psDNA in cells relative to ova-pDNA (approximately fourfold at day 1; p=0.002 and approximately sevenfold at day 3; p=0.004), indicating psDNA is more stable than pDNA ( [Figure 1c](#fig1)). In addition, ova conjugation was required for phagocytosis by BMDCs as we detected limited amounts of unconjugated (values <1 at 1c](#fig1)). To determine if the BMDCs had both the ova and DNA within each cell, we used flow cytometry and immunofluorescence using an antibody to detect ova and streptavidin to detect the biotinylated DNA tag. We detected both ova and DNA within the same cells by flow cytometry ( also measured conjugate stability in mouse LECs, a cell type that retains foreign proteins for long periods ( [Tamburini et al., 2014](#bib81)), and found that ova-psDNA conjugates were stable over 7 days of culture, whereas ova-pDNA was rapidly degraded ( [Figure 1f](#fig1)). In the endothelial cells, we detected both the ova protein and the barcode within the same cell and co-localized to same location ( [Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1b, c](/articles/62781/figures#fig1s1)). Furthermore, the ova-psDNA retention within the LECs was similar to a vaccine strategy using an ova protein-fluorophore conjugate with polyI:C and anti-CD40, which we previously [Tamburini et al., 2014](#bib81); [Figure more phagocytic macrophages, we observed nearly all macrophages phagocytosed the ova-psDNA at day 1 and found the ova and psDNA within the same cell ( [Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1g](/articles/62781/figures#fig1s1)). In macrophages given ova-psDNA 7 prior, we detected only ova protein ( [Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1g](/articles/62781/figures#fig1s1)), potentially resulting from high levels endonucleases found within the lysosome whether conjugation of psDNA to ova affected ova processing and presentation, we measured BMDC presentation of ova-derived SIINFEKL peptide T given ova-psDNA induced significantly more proliferation of OT1 T cells than unconjugated ova ( [Figure 1g, h](#fig1)), enhanced activation of upon with ova-psDNA conjugates. Furthermore, we detected pDNA and psDNA in BMDC culture media at 1 day after addition but not at later time points, confirming that ova-psDNA conjugates are processed and not released OT1 proliferation to ova studies showing conjugation of antigens to RNA or DNA induce TLR7 (RNA) or TLR9 (DNA) signals that lead to prolonged antigen presentation ( [Xu and Moyle, 2018](#bib93)). Addition of polyI:C and anti-CD40 to BMDCs with ova also elicited robust OT1 proliferation, demonstrating that TLR activation on the BMDCs is required for efficient cross-presentation to T cells ( [Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2c](/articles/62781/figures#fig1s2)). We next asked whether vaccination with ova-psDNA conjugates elicits a T cell response in vivo. We compared antigen-specific T cell responses in mice vaccinated with a mixture of ova-psDNA and polyI:C/CD40 to its individual in OT1 proliferation we saw in vitro\u2014found that T cell responses to ova-psDNA were greater than either ova with polyI:C, ova with polyI:C/CD40, or a mixture of 2b](#fig2)). Interestingly, ova-psDNA conjugate combined with polyI:C/CD40 did not significantly enhance the T cell response beyond ova-psDNA alone ( [Figure 2b](#fig2)). T cells stimulated by ova-psDNA produced significantly more IFN than any other vaccination strategy even in the absence of ex vivo SIINFEKL peptide stimulation, indicating prolonged and active presentation of ova-psDNA ( [Figure 2c, d](#fig2)). Together, these data show that ova-psDNA conjugates elicit antigen-specific T cell responses independent of polyI:C/CD40. These findings are consistent with TLR9-dependent immune responses elicited by psDNA ( [Baek et [Coffman et al., 2010](#bib13); et al., 2004](#bib88)), similar to DC presentation of conjugates of ova demonstrated with other TLR agonists ( [see all](/articles/62781/figures#fig2) We previously showed that a vaccination strategy comprising soluble antigen and vaccinia virus (VV; Western Reserve) induced robust antigen archiving that lasts longer than those using polyI:C/CD40 adjuvant ( [Kedl et al., 2017](#bib44)). To evaluate antigen-psDNA performance during an active infection, we determined T cell responses after vaccination by comparing individual components with mixtures of ova, VV, ova-pDNA, or ova-psDNA. Subcutaneously administered ova-psDNA alone ( [Figure 2](#fig2), [Figure to ova-psDNA conjugate moderately increased T cell responses compared to ova-psDNA alone, similar to what we observed with ova-psDNA/polyI:C/CD40 ( [Figure 2](#fig2), [Figure 2\u2014figure cell-type specificity of ova-psDNA dissemination in vivo. Mice were vaccinated with mixtures of (i) ova-psDNA and VV or (ii) ova-psDNA and polyI:C/CD40, and levels of ova-psDNA were quantified by PCR in both leukocytes and SCs (fractionated by CD45 expression) in the draining LNs. We found that CD45- SCs had high amounts of ova-psDNA, but not ova-pDNA, corresponding to increased inflammation ( [Tamburini et al., 2014](#bib81)), whereas CD45+ leukocytes had very low levels of ova-psDNA or ova-pDNA 7 days after vaccination ( [Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2c](/articles/62781/figures#fig2s2)). These data recapitulate our previous demonstration of durable antigen retention by CD45- SCs ( [Kedl et al., 2017](#bib44); [Tamburini et al., 2014](#bib81)), confirming that ova-psDNA, but not ova-pDNA, is a faithful tracking device for antigen archiving in vivo. Molecular tracking of antigen during the immune response to vaccination Given the ability of the antigen-psDNA conjugates to induce a robust immune response in vivo ( [Figure 2](#fig2)) and our ability to use the psDNA as a measure of protein antigen levels ( [Figure 1](#fig1)), we used the antigen-psDNA conjugate as a 'molecular tracking device' to understand the distribution of the protein antigen in the LN following this vaccination. To determine whether we could identify if cells acquire and archive ( [Tamburini et al., 2014](#bib81)) antigens following antigen-psDNA, we vaccinated in [Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2c](/articles/62781/figures#fig2s2)), and evaluated antigen distribution (via psDNA abundance) in the LN at early (2 days) and late (14 days) time points. At each time point, single-cell suspensions were prepared from draining popliteal LNs and divided into SC (by depleting CD45+ cells) or lymphocyte populations and [Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1b](/articles/62781/figures#fig2s1)). To enrich for myeloid cell populations but maintain representation of other cell types, CD11c+, CD11b+, B220+, and ungated live cells were mixed at a 4:4:1:1 ratio, respectively. These cell populations were analyzed by single-cell mRNA sequencing, measuring both mRNA expression and the quantity of psDNA in each cell using unique molecular al., 2014](#bib38); [Figure 3](#fig3)). [see all](/articles/62781/figures#fig3) recovered a total of 800 cells in the CD45- fraction and 8187 cells in the CD45+ fraction at the 2-day time point. We recovered more CD45- cells (6372 CD45-; 4840 CD45+) at the 14-day time point likely due to expansion and proliferation of the LN stroma ( [Tamburini and Tamburini, 2019](#bib55)). We classified cell types using an automated approach ( [Fu et al., 2020](#bib24)), comparing measured mRNA expression patterns to reference data sets for DCs ( et the CD45+ fraction monocytes, T cells, and B cells ( [Figure 3a, b, d, e](#fig3)), while the CD45- fraction including LECs, BECs, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts ( [Figure 3g j, k](#fig3)). We did not recover VV mRNAs in cells at either time point, possibly due to viral clearance or a failure to recover infected, apoptotic cells in the live/dead selection ( [Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1b](/articles/62781/figures#fig2s1)). We first examined the dynamic changes of myeloid populations in the LN. We detected conventional DCs, including cDC1 and cDC2 ( [Figure 3a-c](#fig3)), which develop from a common DC of FMS-like tyrosine migratory cDCs can be distinguished by expression of cell-type-specific transcription factors including basic leucine zipper transcription factor (Batf3) and interferon regulatory factor (IRF8) et al., 2011](#bib53); [Schlitzer et al., 2013](#bib74)). These cDC types are also typically classified based on expression of CD11c, Zbtb46, and chemokine categorized et al., 2019](#bib11)). As expected, at day 2 we identified a large population of LN-resident cDC2B (cDC2 Tbet-) cells harboring ova-psDNA ( [Brown we did not find any cDC2A (cDC2 Tbet+) cells, consistent with their role in anti-inflammatory processes ( [Brown et al., 2019](#bib11)). CCR7hi cDCs (n = 3432; 42% of total), which we classified as migratory DCs. This migratory DC population included Langerhans cells (n = 285; 3.5% of total), migratory cDC1s (n = 593; 7.2% of total), and migratory cDC2s (n = of total) dermis ( [Figure 3b](#fig3)). At LN-resident cDC2 Tbet+ cells ( [Figure 3e](#fig3)) consistent with response ( [Brown et al., 2019](#bib11)). As cDC2 Tbet+ cells are thought to be anti-inflammatory, these data suggest that the immune response is being quelled ( [Figure 3e](#fig3)). We also found a group of Siglec-H+ cDC progenitor population ( [Figure 3d, e](#fig3)). unique we quantified the amount of ova-psDNA, psDNA, and pDNA across cell types. Levels of ova-psDNA molecules spanned four orders of magnitude, ranging up to 104 unique molecules and depending on the cell types and time point ( [Figure 3c, f, i, l](#fig3)). In contrast to the large range of ova-psDNA across cell types, unconjugated psDNA and pDNA were largely undetectable, indicating that antigen conjugation is required for cell acquisition ( [Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1](/articles/62781/figures#fig3s1)). Consistent with our previous studies ( [Kedl et al., 2017](#bib44)), we did not detect antigen-psDNA at appreciable levels in T cells or B cells ( [Figure 3](#fig3)), and because these cell types were captured in both our CD45- and CD45+ samples, we used their median antigen levels to normalize antigen counts in other cell types across captures. We considered the trivial case wherein variation in antigen levels is explained by total mRNA abundance; these variables are uncorrelated in SC types and weakly correlated in cDC subtypes, possibly reflecting activation status ( [Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2](/articles/62781/figures#fig3s2)). At the early day 2 time point, LN-resident cDC2s contained high levels of antigen-psDNA, consistent with studies of antigens administered et al., 2017](#bib26); [Figure 3b, c](#fig3)). In addition, we found significantly higher levels of antigen in cDC2 Tbet-, average of approximately sevenfold more antigen than T/B cells. At the later time point, migratory cDC1 cells contained the most antigen, consistent with previous studies ( [Kedl et al., 2017](#bib44); [Figure 3e](#fig3)). In addition, Tbet- and CCR7hi migratory cDC2s contained moderate levels of antigen, up to threefold more than T/B cells, but had lower amounts of antigen relative to day 2 ( [Figure 3b, c, e, f](#fig3), [Figure 3\u2014source data 1](#fig3sdata1)). At the late time point, we did not detect significant amounts of antigen in LN-resident in the LN are classified by their association with blood or lymphatic vasculature; both are required for circulation and trafficking of immune cells to the LN. The blood vasculature circulates naive lymphocytes to the LN, and the lymphatic vasculature transports immune cells from the peripheral tissue including dermal DCs and memory T cells. We used an automated approach ( [Fu et al., 2020](#bib24)) that uses correlation between reference and measured gene expression profiles to assign unknown cell types to subtypes defined by previous studies. While strong correlation reflects a good match between reference and query profiles, high correlation between multiple reference LEC subtypes ( [Fujimoto et al., 2020](#bib25); [Kalucka et al., 2020](#bib43); [Xiang et al., 2020](#bib91)) and changes in expression induced by antigen acquisition made definitive cell-type assignments challenging ( [Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3a-c](/articles/62781/figures#fig3s3)). Notwithstanding these issues, we classified LEC subsets based on the highest correlation values to reference cell types ( [Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3d, e](/articles/62781/figures#fig3s3); [Xiang LEC et LECs, ceiling LECs, and Marco LECs with high levels of antigen at the early time point ( [Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3](/articles/62781/figures#fig3s3)). At the late time point, expansion and proliferation of LN SCs contributed to larger populations of cells including floor LECs, collecting LECs, ceiling et al., 2012](#bib57)). At the day 14 time point, several LEC subtypes maintained high antigen levels ( [Figure 3h](#fig3), [Figure 3\u2014source data 1](#fig3sdata1)). Floor LECs had uniformly high amounts of antigen. Median levels of ova-psDNA were detected in collecting, Ptx3, and ceiling LEC populations that were significantly higher than B/T cells; however, cells in these groups contained a range of antigen with both high and low populations. We hypothesized that this variability stems from the physical location of the LECs within the LN and their access to trafficking antigen. Using a fluorescently labeled ova with polyI:C/CD4012, we confirmed that fluorescent antigen amounts are highest on subcapsular LECs as identified by surface expression of PD-L1 and ICAM1 2 weeks after immunization, similar to ova-psDNA vaccination ( et [Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4](/articles/62781/figures#fig3s4)). Together, our findings suggest that antigen first passes through the sinus followed by the cortex and medulla. These data also suggest that populations of LECs with less antigen could be a result of how the antigen travels through the LN or mechanisms of antigen release over time. Similar to the endothelial cell population, the number and types of non-endothelial SCs increased at the later time point after immunization. Non-endothelial SCs in the LN are classified by their location in the LN into reticular additional were Ccl19lo TRCs located at the T-zone perimeter, Cxcl9+ TRCs found in both the T-zone and interfollicular region, CD34+ SCs found in the capsule and medullary vessel adventitia, indolethylamine N-methyltransferase+ SCs found in the and Nr4a1+ SCs ( [Rodda et al., 2018](#bib68)). At the early point, the Cxcl9+ TRCs and CD34+ SCs ( [Rodda et al., 2018](#bib68)) had high amounts antigen relative to T/B cells) ( [Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5](/articles/62781/figures#fig3s5)). At the late time point, SCs, Nr4a1+ SCs, FDCs, the antigen 3k](#fig3), [Figure 3\u2014source data 1](#fig3sdata1)). Interestingly, the are adjacent to ceiling LECs and the Nr4a1+ SCs are found in the medullary chord and medullary sinus, which are lined by medullary LECs. These findings may suggest potential antigen exchange mechanisms between LECs and SCs that have yet to be defined. We found little antigen in PvCs or FDCs ( [Figure 3k](#fig3), [Figure 3\u2014source data 1](#fig3sdata1)). Finally, these data provided insight into antigen transfer between SCs and DCs, a process important for enhanced protective immunity ( [Kedl et al., 2017](#bib44); [Tamburini et al., 2014](#bib81)). We previously showed that archived antigen obtained from the polyI:C/anti-CD40-based vaccine is transferred from LECs to migratory Batf3-dependent cDC1s 2 weeks after infection ( [Kedl et al., 2017](#bib44)). Here, we confirm that with the ova-psDNA vaccine CCR7hi migratory cDC1s had the highest amount of antigen 2 weeks after vaccination ( [Figure 3e](#fig3), [Figure 3\u2014source data 1](#fig3sdata1); [Kedl et al., 2017](#bib44)). Together, these data validate the use of molecular tracking devices by corroborating previous studies of antigen trafficking with other vaccination strategies and identify new cells types that dynamically acquire antigen during infection. Gene expression signatures associated with antigen acquisition by DCs We next leveraged the variation in antigen levels across cell types ( [Figure 3b, e, h, k](#fig3)) to identify gene expression signatures associated with high levels of antigen that would validate our approach. We classified cells as 'antigen-high' and 'antigen-low' using a two-component mixture model and identified marker genes associated with each class ( [Figure 4a, b](#fig4)). To validate this approach, we evaluated the DC populations as genes associated with phagocytosis and activation have been established ( [Miller et al., [Breuilh et 2017](#bib67); [Sinclair, 1999](#bib76)). DC populations generally contained lower antigen levels that were variable across subtype ( [Figure 3](#fig3)). We classified antigen-low and antigen-high cells for each subtype. Among the subtypes with significant amounts of antigen, Tbet- cDC2 cells had the highest antigen levels and largest differences in gene expression (277 genes in antigen-high cells, [Figure 4](#fig4), [Figure 4\u2014source data 1](#fig4sdata1)), consistent with cDC2s acting as the primary cell type of antigen uptake following protein ( [Gerner et al., 2017](#bib26)). At the early time point, genes upregulated in antigen-high recruitment of et al., 2019](#bib27); well as Pkm, Lgals3, and Mif (consistent with DC-T cell responses and DC differentiation during inflammation; [Breuilh et al., 2007](#bib10); 2020](#bib41); [Figure 4c, d](#fig4)). At the late day 14 time point, the highest antigen counts were found in the migratory cDC1 population, consistent with a role for migratory cDC1s in archived antigen acquisition 2017](#bib44); [Figure 3e, highly expressed by cDC1 Consistent DCs being involved in archived antigen presentation, Ccl5 (also known as RANTES) regulates CD8 T cell responses during chronic viral infection ( [Crawford et al., 2011](#bib17)) and Fscn1, an actin binding protein, regulates cell migration of mature DCs via podosome formation ( [Yamakita et al., 2011](#bib94)). Similar to the day 2 time point, among subtypes with significant amounts of antigen, Tbet- cDC2 populations showed the greatest differences in gene expression between antigen-high and -low cells proinflammatory cytokine production ( 2008](#bib58)), and CD72 and Acp5, which are important for the inflammatory response and pathogen these genes evoke specific processes in DC subsets required for the immune response; it remains to be determined whether they are specifically associated with LEC-DC antigen exchange or storage of antigens within DCs. Gene expression signatures associated with antigen archival by LECs We next evaluated the LEC population to determine whether our classification approach could identify genes involved in antigen archiving. We applied the classifier to LECs as a population and found large numbers of antigen-high-floor, collecting, and ceiling LECs ( [Figure a mixture of antigen-low and antigen-high cells, but there was a larger fraction of Ptx3 LECs with low antigen ( [Figure LECs compared to LECs overall (34% of total), suggesting that antigen archiving may be specific to LECs in general rather than attributable to a specific LEC subset ( [Figure 5](#fig5)). Using this classification approach, we identified 142 mRNAs that were significantly changed in LECs identified, was highly expressed in antigen-high LECs, independent of the LEC type ( [Figure 5d, e](#fig5)). Prox1 is a transcription factor required for LEC differentiation from BECs and defines LEC identity via regulation of Vegfr3, Pdpn, and Lyve-1 antigen-high LECs indicates it may also regulate processes involved in antigen archiving. Upregulation of Cavin2 by antigen-high LECs suggested caveolar endocytosis may contribute to antigen acquisition by LECs, consistent with LEC dynamin-mediated transcytosis also upregulated by BECs, suggesting that Cavin2 mediates endocytosis specifically in endothelial cells of the lymphatic lineage. Based on Cavin2 gene expression, it appears that this process may be most active in ceiling LECs ( [Figure 5e](#fig5)). To confirm this finding, we asked whether inhibition of the caveolin pathway with nystatin impaired endocytosis of fluorescent antigen in mice vaccinated with polyI:C/CD40. We found a significant decrease in antigen acquired by LECs in the nystatin treatment group 24 hr after administration of fluorescent antigen with this vaccine regimen ( [Figure 5f](#fig5)), affirming the utility of molecular tracking devices for identifying genes involved in the process of antigen acquisition or archival that are not necessarily specific to antigen-psDNA conjugates. Finally, expression of Stabilin-1 cells, suggesting that scavenging pathways are required for the acquisition of antigen-psDNA conjugates after vaccination. Stab2 is uniquely expressed by LECs in the LN and not by BECs ( [Malhotra et al., 2012](#bib57)), and Stab1 receptors for internalization of antisense oligonucleotides with phosphorothioate linkages in liver and Kupffer cells ( [Miller et al., 2016](#bib62)). However, we did not find amounts of unconjugated psDNA in LECs are upregulated as part of an antigen scavenging or trafficking program initiated in LECs upon antigen acquisition during infection. Discussion Our development of a 'molecular tracking device' enabled tracking of antigen throughout the LN to specific cell types that acquire and archive antigens following subcutaneous immunization. Previous studies used canonical surface markers to track antigen by microscopy and flow cytometry; instead, our approach simultaneously defines cell type by gene expression and quantifies the acquired antigen. The molecular tracking device includes phosphorothioate DNA conjugation, which provides a combined TLR-antigen delivery system to study antigen distribution at time points beyond the lifetime of antigen-fluorophore conjugates and provided a map of cell types involved in antigen-psDNA acquisition and retention. Our approach expands upon our previous studies with other vaccine regimens that induce antigen archiving and cell types that enhance protective immunity. Both here and in our previous studies, we found that whereas LECs archive antigen, migratory DCs passing through the lymphatic vasculature are required to retrieve and present archived antigen to memory CD8 T cells derived from the initial infection or immunization ( [Eisenbarth, 2019](#bib19)). Using an antigen/polyI:C/CD40 vaccine regimen, we determined that antigen exchange from LECs to DCs and subsequent DC presentation yields memory CD8 T cells with robust effector function during infectious challenge. The studies included here predict the same outcome as both LECs and migratory DCs were detected with ova-psDNA at the late time point. Several recent reports defined LEC and non-endothelial SC subsets within the al., 2020](#bib43); [Xiang et al., 2020](#bib91)). By combining our molecular tracking device with these reference cell types, we found that non-endothelial SC types acquire foreign antigens including CD34+ SCs, which neighbor subcapsular sinus LECs in the tissue ( [Rodda et al., 2018](#bib68)). These findings suggest that the interstitial pressure created by subcutaneous vaccination allows antigens to pass through the tissue directly to the LN capsule, bypassing the lymphatic capillaries. Intriguingly, bypass of lymphatic capillaries may still lead to LEC acquisition of antigens from the CD34+ SCs via SC-LEC exchange. Such a mechanism would encourage future LEC-DC interactions and provide a benefit to protective immunity. Molecular tracking devices provide a measure of cell state orthogonal to gene expression, which we leveraged to identify candidate pathways involved in antigen-psDNA acquisition ( [Figure 4](#fig4)). We the caveolin pathway is upregulated in antigen-high LECs and demonstrate this pathway is involved in antigen acquisition in vivo following vaccination with 2008](#bib33); [Malhotra et al., 2012](#bib57)) represent targets for further manipulation of antigen archiving by LECs. The psDNA component of the tracking device elicits an immune response similar to other TLR-antigen conjugate [Oh and likely due to antigen-psDNA stability within DCs that causes prolonged antigen presentation in the cells that acquire the antigen ( [van Montfoort et al., 2009](#bib87); [Xu and Moyle, 2018](#bib93)). This effect is illustrated by increased IFN production in the absence of ex vivo peptide stimulus (ova-psDNA compared to unconjugated ova; [Figure 2](#fig2)). Prolonged antigen presentation better replicates an infection wherein levels of viral or bacterial antigen rise over the duration of infection. However, in other applications it may be helpful to limit the immunoreactivity of the antigen-psDNA via cytosine methylation modification ( [Lange et al., 2019](#bib52)). While many of the experiments we performed with the ova-psDNA were consistent with our experiments using antigen-TLR conjugates or TLR/CD40-based vaccines, it is likely that this type of vaccine interacts with different cell types and utilizes different mechanisms for antigen acquisition and retention. These mechanisms are currently under active investigation and may be more generalizable in the absence of TLR9. A caveat of our studies concerns the dynamic stability of molecular tracking devices in tissue. Multiple detection methods showed that the protein and DNA components of our conjugates psDNA is not readily taken up by cells. However, flow cytometry analysis of conjugates in BMDM indicates that DNA degradation may precede protein degradation ( [Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1g](/articles/62781/figures#fig1s1)). With that said, it remains possible that acquisition of molecular tracking devices by certain cell types leads to decoupling of the individual components after which they could be independently transferred to other cells via trogocytosis or other mechanisms of membrane transfer ( [Alegre et al., 2010](#bib3)). Closer evaluation of the protein-DNA complex in vivo over time will be important to determine how accurately detection of the DNA via single-cell sequencing reflects the movement of the protein-DNA complex. Future experiments will address the dynamics of conjugate stability across multiple cell types to quantify the low levels of unconjugated components and better define the limitations of molecular tracking devices in studying protein degradation intermediates. Molecular tracking devices will enable new approaches to study molecular dissemination in vivo. To date, protein-DNA conjugates have been deployed in single-cell vivo staining applications (e.g., CITE-seq; [Islam et al., 2014](#bib38)). Our study lays the groundwork for molecular tracking devices involving protein, antibody, drug, or pathogens conjugated to nuclease-resistant, barcoded oligonucleotides that are stable during transit through mouse tissues. The approach naturally extends to understanding how multiple different antigens might be processed (using unique DNA barcodes) and enables new studies to manipulate antigen archiving to improve vaccines, vaccine formulations, and prime-boost strategies. Moreover, the oligonucleotide portion of the tracking device should enable analysis of its distribution in cells by in situ hybridization or intact tissue by spatial transcriptomics ( [Eng et al., 2016](#bib77)), obviating the need for antibody-mediated detection of antigen. Materials and methods Mice 5-6 week-old mice were purchased from Charles River or Jackson Laboratory, unless otherwise stated, bred and housed in the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus Animal Barrier Facility. Wild type and OT1 mice were all bred on a C57BL/6 background. OT1 mice are a TCR transgenic strain specific to the SIINFEKL peptide of ova (OVA257-264) in the context of H-2Kb. All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Colorado. Phosphorothioate and phosphodiester oligonucleotides [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap62781?item=s4-2) Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) and contained a 5 amine for conjugation, primer binding site, barcode, 10x Genomics Gel Bead Primer binding site for capture sequence 2, and a 3 biotin. Phosphorothioate oligonucleotides contained a phosphorothioate modification at every can in 7.6; sterile filtered). Dilution of this buffer to 1\u00d7 results in a final pH of 8.5. A reaction containing 40 nmol of amine-modified oligo (0.5 mM), 1\u00d7 BBS, 100 mM TCO-PEG4-NHS in DMSO (10 mM final; Click Chemistry Tools, A137), pH 8.5 was rotated at room temperature for 15 min. A second aliquot containing the same amount of TCO-PEG4-NHS in DMSO was added, and the reaction was rotated at room temperature for another hour. Excess NHS was quenched by adding glycine, pH 8.5 to a final concentration of 20 mM and rotated at room temperature for 5 min. Modification was confirmed by analysis on an 8% denaturing TBE PAGE gel. Samples were precipitated by splitting the reaction into 20 \u00b5L aliquots and adding 280 \u00b5L of nuclease-free water, 30 \u00b5L of 3 M NaCl, and 990 \u00b5L of 100% ethanol. The precipitation reaction was incubated at 80\u00b0C overnight, followed by centrifugation at >10,000,000 \u00d7g for 30 min. The supernatant was discarded, the pellet was washed with 100 \u00b5L of 75% ethanol, and centrifuged at >10,000,000 \u00d7g for 10 min. The supernatant was removed, and the pellets were dried for 5 min at room temperature. The pellets were recombined by resuspension in 50 \u00b5L of 1\u00d7 BBS. Samples were quantified by A260. To conjugate methyltetrazine to ova, detoxified ova (Sigma-Aldrich, St. MO) (using a Triton X-114 lipopolysaccharide detoxification method; [Anis et al., 2007](#bib5)) was buffer exchanged into 1\u00d7 BBS, pH 8.5. To an Amicon 0.5 mL 30 kDa filter (Millipore, UFC5030) was added 1 mg of ova and 1\u00d7 BBS to a volume of 450 L. The filter was centrifuged at 14,000 \u00d7g for 5 min. The flow through was discarded and the sample washed twice with 400 \u00b5L of 1\u00d7 BBS. The product-containing column was inverted into a clean collection tube and centrifuged at 1000 \u00d7g for 2 min. Assuming no loss, the volume of the sample was adjusted to 2 mg/mL with 1\u00d7 BBS. 400 \u00b5L of 1\u00d7 BBS was added to the Amicon filter and stored at 4\u00b0C for later use. A 500 \u00b5L labeling reaction containing 0.5 mg of ova in 1\u00d7 BBS and 50 \u00b5L of 2 mM mTz-PEG4-NHS in DMSO (0.2 mM final; Click Chemistry Tools, 1069), pH 8.5 was rotated at 4\u00b0C overnight. Excess NHS was quenched by adding glycine, pH 8.5 to a final concentration of 20 mM and rotated at room temperature for 10 min. The previously stored Amicon filter was centrifuged at 14,000 \u00d7g for 5 min and the flow through discarded. 400 \u00b5L of reaction mixture was added to the filter and centrifuged at 14,000 \u00d7g for 5 min. This was repeated until all 1 mg of protein had been added to the filter and was supplemented with 1\u00d7 BBS as needed. Samples were washed 1\u00d7 with 400 \u00b5L of 1\u00d7 BBS. The product-containing column was inverted into a clean collection tube and centrifuged at 1000 \u00d7g for 2 min. Assuming no loss, the volume of the sample was adjusted to 5 mg/mL with 1\u00d7 BBS. For the final antigen-DNA conjugation, a 100 \u00b5L reaction containing 300 \u00b5g of and 6 nmol of oligonucleotide-TCO (1:1 equivalents) 1\u00d7 was rotated 4\u00b0C overnight. Excess mTz was quenched with 10 \u00b5L of 10 mM TCO-PEG4-glycine and rotated at room temperature for 10 min. TCO-PEG4-glycine was prepared by reaction of 10 mM TCO-PEG4-NHS with 20 mM glycine, pH 8.5 in 1\u00d7 BBS for 1 hr at room temperature and stored at 20\u00b0C. Products were analyzed by 10% TBE PAGE. For purification, excess ova and DNA were removed by filter centrifugation. 200 \u00b5L of 1\u00d7 PBS was added to an Amicon 0.5 mL 50 kDa filter (Millipore, UFC5050) followed by 300 \u00b5L of sample. The filter was centrifuged at 14,000 \u00d7g for 5 min and the flow through discarded. Samples were washed five times with 400 \u00b5L of 1\u00d7 PBS and centrifuged at 14,000 \u00d7g for 5 min. The product-containing column was inverted into a clean collection tube and centrifuged at 1000 \u00d7g for 2 min. Purified products were analyzed by 10% TBE PAGE and total protein quantified with Bio-Rad protein quantification reagent (Bio-Rad, 5000006). LPS contamination after conjugation was below 0.5 EU/mg as mentioned in the 'Vaccinations' section. Bone marrow-derived DC, macrophages, and LEC cultures [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap62781?item=s4-4) Both left and right tibia and femur were isolated under sterile conditions. Bone marrow was extracted from femurs of 6-8-week-old C57BL/6 mice by decollating the top and bottom of the bone and releasing the marrow with 27 gauge syringe and 5 mL of Modified Essential Medium(MEM) (Cellgro). Suspension was strained through 100 m filter, pressed with the back of a syringe and washed.

SVECs have been characterized to be similar to LECs ( [Xiong et al., 2017](#bib92)), and CD31 and PDPN expression were validated prior to use. SVEC were cultured in RPMI with 10% FBS and passaged with passive trypsin and split at a density of 1:3. For BMDMs, whole bone marrow was isolated and red blood cells were lysed. Cells were then cultured in M-CSF (50 ng/mL) for 6 days in complete media. Cells were harvested via cell scraper and plated for treatment. Conjugate detection assay [Request a (SVECs) or BMDM cultures were stimulated with 5 \u00b5g of either ova-psDNA or ova with or without 20 \u00b5g of anti-CD40, 20 \u00b5g Poly I:C in a 6-well format. 24 hr post treatment, cells were washed and refreshed with new media. At designated time points, cells were harvested, counted, and transferred into micro-centrifuge tubes, spun at 350 g, and both supernatant and pellets were frozen at 80\u00b0C. Cell pellets were lysed in 50 \u00b5L of Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent (Thermo Scientific, 78503). Conjugate DNA was measured by qPCR amplification from 1 \u00b5L of lysate in a 10 \u00b5L reaction containing of Universal SYBR Green ( [Figure 1\u2014source data 1](#fig1sdata1)). Quantification was measured using an external standard curve and normalized to lysate protein content. To visualize within ova-psDNA acquisition by cells, cells were fixed with 10% formalin for 10 min at room temperature in the dark, washed with PBS, and spun for 10 min at 2000 rpm. Cells were then permeabilized with 100% ice-cold methanol for 20 min at 20\u00b0C. Cells were then washed with PBS and spun as above. Cells were stained with the anti-ova antibody as above for at least 2 hr at room temperature and then washed with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) with sodium azide (FACS buffer) and spun as above. Cells were then incubated with an anti-rabbit secondary in PE for 1 hr at room temperature and then washed with FACS buffer. Cells were then stained with streptavidin conjugated to BV421 in PBS for 15 min at room temperature and then washed twice with FACS buffer prior to acquiring cells on a FACS CANTO II flow cytometer. Analysis was performed using FlowJo software. Immunofluorescence was performed as above except cells were grown on glass coverslips and stained on cover slips using an anti-rabbit dylight 649 and streptavidin-FITC. Coverslips were imaged on a Zeiss LSM780 confocal microscope. The imaging experiments were performed in the Advanced Light Microscopy Core part of the NeuroTechnology Center at University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus supported in part by the Rocky Mountain Neurological Disorders Core Grant Number P30 NS048154 and by the Diabetes Research Center Grant Number P30 DK116073.

OT1 isolation and co-culture [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap62781?item=s4-6) CD8 T cells were isolated from an OT1+ mouse using the mojosort mouse CD8 T cell isolation kit (Biolegend) and labeled with violet proliferation dye (BD Biosciences cat# 562158). For DC-T cell co-culture, BMDCs were treated with psOVA (5 g), or ova+psDNA (5 g) for 1, 3, or 7 days. BMDCs were washed and then co-cultured with labeled OT1s for 3 days at a 1:10 ratio of BMDC:OT1. Cells were then stained and run on a flow cytometer. OT1 division (percent dividing cells) was calculated as previously described ( [Roederer, 2011](#bib70)) using the equation fraction diluted , where i is the generation number (0 is the undivided population), and Ni is the number of events in generation i. Vaccinations [Request a (CFU) of Reserve or 5 \u00b5g of poly I:C (Invivogen) with or without anti-CD40 (FGK4.5, BioXcell)and 10 \u00b5g of ova-psDNA or ova in 50 L volume by footpad injection. Endotoxin levels were quantified using the Pierce Limulus Amebocyte Lysate Chromogenic Endotoxin Quantitation kit (Thermo Scientific) to be less than 0.5 EU/mg for either ova or ova conjugated to DMSO to a concentration of 10 mg/mL. Mice were injected with 50 L of 10 mg/mL nystatin per footpad 1 hr prior to injection with ova conjugated to Alexa 488 (5 g) in a mixture with polyI:C and anti-CD40 (2.5 g each).

Cells were washed and stained for 30 flow cytometer (BD). Preparation of single-cell suspensions [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap62781?item=s4-10) 2 days or 2 weeks following vaccination with 1E3 CFU of VV-WR with 10 g of ova-psDNA per footpad, popliteal LNs were removed from 15 mice and LNs were pulled apart with 22-gauge needles. Tissue was digested with 0.25 mg of Liberase DL (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) per mL of EHAA media with DNAse (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ) at 37\u00b0. Every 15 min media was removed, cells spun down, and new digestion media added to the undigested tissue until no tissue remained, ~1 hr. Following digestion, cells were filtered through a screen and washed with 5 mM EDTA in EHAA. LN cells were then divided into thirds where one-third underwent staining with CD11c (N418), CD11b and B220, and a live/dead dye (Tonbo). Live cells were then sorted into four tubes on a FACS (BD Biosciences Cat # 546406) ungated live cells, which were recombined at a 4:4:1:1 ratio, respectively. For the remaining two-thirds of cells, cells were stained with CD45 PE followed by magnetic bead isolation using the Miltenyi bead isolation kit. CD45-negative cells that passed through the column were then washed. Both sorted and selected (CD45+ and CD45-) cells were then washed with PBS in 0.1% BSA as described in the Cell Prep Guide (10x Genomics) and counted using a hemacytometer. Final concentration of cells was approximately 1000 cells/\u00b5L and approximately 10-20 \u00b5L were assayed.

Products were purified according to the CITE-seq protocol. Gene expression and antigen tag libraries were analyzed on the Agilent D1000 Tapestation and quantified using the Qubit HS dsDNA fluorometric quantitation kit (Thermo Scientific). All libraries were sequenced on a Illumina NovaSeq 6000 with 2 \u00d7 150 base pair read lengths. Transcriptome and oligonucleotide detection and analysis [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap62781?item=s4-12) Briefly, FASTQ files from the gene expression and antigen tracking libraries were processed using the feature barcode version of the cellranger count pipeline (v3.1.0). Reads were aligned to the mm10 and vaccinia virus (NC_006998) reference genomes. Analysis of gene expression and antigen tracking data was performed using the Seurat R package (v3.2). Antigen tracking and gene expression data were combined into the same Seurat object for each sample (CD45-/day 2, CD45+/day 2, CD45-/day 14, CD45+/day 14). Cells were filtered based on the number of detected genes (>250 and <5000) and the percent of mitochondrial reads (<15%). Gene expression counts were log-normalized (NormalizeData), and relative ova signal was calculated by dividing ova-psDNA counts by the median ova-psDNA counts for all T and B cells present in the sample. To allow for the values to be log-transformed for visualization, a pseudo count was added (smallest non-zero value * 0.5). Gene expression data were scaled and centered (ScaleData). 2000 variable features (FindVariableFeatures) were used for PCA (RunPCA), and the first 40 principal components were used to find clusters (FindNeighbors, FindClusters) and calculate uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) (RunUMAP). Cell types were ( [https://rnabioco.github.io/clustifyr](https://rnabioco.github.io/clustifyr)) ( [Fu et al., 2020](#bib24)) along with reference bulk RNA-seq data from ImmGen (available for download through the clustifyrdata R package, [https://rnabioco.github.io/clustifyrdata](https://rnabioco.github.io/clustifyrdata)). To annotate cell subtypes, the samples were divided into separate objects 2020](#bib43); al., 2020](#bib91)). After assigning DC, LEC, and FRC subtypes, the other cell types (T/B cells, epithelial cells, NK cells) were added back to the objects and reprocessed as described above. Identification of ova-low and -high populations was accomplished using a two-component Gaussian mixture model implemented with the R package mixtools ( [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mixtools/index.html](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mixtools/index.html)). All LECs were -high populations were identified independently for each DC cell type. For ova-low and ova-high populations, differentially expressed genes were identified using the R package presto (wilcoxauc, [https://github.com/immunogenomics/presto](https://github.com/immunogenomics/presto)). Differentially expressed genes were filtered to include those with an adjusted p-value<0.05, log fold-change > 0.25, area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) > 0.5, and with at least 50% of ova-high cells expressing the gene.

Acceptance summary: You have developed a powerful method to track in vivo the cellular distribution of an immunogenic protein-DNA complex overlaid with the rich information from single cell RNA seq. This has enabled you to quantify the archiving of antigens in lymphatic endothelial cells, better understand the molecule pathways involved in archiving, and put this in context with the distribution of the protein-DNA complexes among dendritic populations at early and late time points. The work will be of interest to immunologists and vascular biologists, and the general approach may find application in tracking the fate of macromolecules incorporating oligonucleotides in other contexts. Decision letter after peer review: Thank you for submitting your article \"Molecular tracking devices quantify antigen distribution and archiving in the lymph node\" for consideration by eLife. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Michael L Dustin as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Carla Rothlin as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is \"in revision at eLife\". Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.) Summary: The idea of using DNA tags to enable tracking of protein and its subsequent handling is innovative and interesting. The manuscript is well written and some of the notions presented may help drive the field forward. There is a potential to revise the manuscript for eLife as a proof of principle for the approach of using scRNA seq to track an antigen in vivo. Essential revisions: the archiving of the psDNA-Ova conjugate in lymphatic endothelial cells matches the earlier observations of fluorescently tagged Ova, the power of this method is to work with scRNAseq to be able to identify novel cells that interact the complex. In this regard, it's clear that the psDNA-Ova may interact differently with various cell types due to the potential for recognition of the psDNA, particularly by TLR9 as suggested. Tracking the psDNA-Ova conjugate as an immunogenic adjuvant-antigen complex is an interesting starting point. You can address this concern by reframing the goal from tracking a protein antigen to characterizing the archiving and presentation of the barcoded psDNA-Ova complex. This doesn't require any additional work, just changing the way you set it up- that this if you immunogen is a DNA-protein complex- you can track it by scRNA-seq. The potential to study trafficking in a TLR9 KO mice in the future might open up using this method more generically for tracking the protein antigen, but this would require much more work to rule out other influence of the DNA on archiving and processing of the antigen. Your evidence that the psDNA really reflects the distribution of the protein is not sufficient. In Figure 1 c and d it's not clear how you measure the amount of protein? Is this the protein injected or the protein detected in a immunoblot or capture immunoassay? To extend the in vitro analysis in Figure 1c and d to actually visualize the native protein with anti-Ova and the psDNA by FISH would provide a high degree of clarity that the psDNA is not acting like a tattoo that outlives the intact protein. The FISH method could take advantage of any amplification step as long as it is consistent with detection by scRNAseq. Microscopy could demonstrate that the two signals remain in the same comparments. A particularly powerful way to show the direct association would be to perform a bulk IP-seq with anti-Ova and detection of the bar code with a test of the efficiency of depletion of the bar code form the cell lysate. A well-controlled experiment could be performed to map out the time dependent loss of protein (IP-western or capture immunoassay), and the free and protein associated psDNA. It would be ideal to include a macrophage in the analysis as a highly degradative cells in comparison to the dendritic cell and LEC, that maybe more specialized to regain intact proteins.

The potential to study trafficking in a TLR9 KO mice in the future might open up using this method more generically for tracking the protein antigen, but this would require much more work to rule out other influence of the DNA on archiving and processing of the antigen. Thank you for this suggestion, we edited the text to clearly indicate that we are characterizing the archiving and presentation of a barcoded psDNA-ova complex as a new vaccination method that has unique features. We have also highlighted that antigen archiving that occurs following combined TLR/anti-CD40 has similar characteristics to ova-psDNA vaccination. Our future studies are aimed at identifying differences and using the TLR9KO mice to more generically track the protein antigen, as mentioned by the reviewer. Your evidence that the psDNA really reflects the distribution of the protein is not sufficient. In Figure 1 c and d it's not clear how you measure the amount of protein? We added text to better explain how we quantified the amount of DNA. Lines 84-86. We have added additional text and figures to demonstrate that the amount of protein correlates with the amount of DNA present. New figure 1d,e and supplementary figure 2a,b,f,g. Lines 89-93, 96-98, 101-105 Is this the protein injected or the protein detected in a immunoblot or capture immunoassay? In the figure you are referring to the amount of protein detected is the total protein within the cell to normalize the amount of DNA to variations in the lysis of the cells over time and across experiments. The question I believe you are asking is how we know how much of the ova protein is detected in the cell when conjugated to the DNA and what is the relative amount. As stated above we have performed several new experiments to demonstrate that we can detect ova and psDNA within the same cells and co-localized together in addition to demonstrating ova presentation by the dendritic cells in figure 1. These new experiments and text can be found lines 89-105 and figures 1d,e and figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1a,b,c,g To extend the in vitro analysis in Figure 1c and d to actually visualize the native protein with anti-Ova and the psDNA by FISH would provide a high degree of clarity that the psDNA is not acting like a tattoo that outlives the intact protein. The FISH method could take advantage of any amplification step as long as it is consistent with detection by scRNAseq.

A well-controlled experiment could be performed to map out the time dependent loss of protein (IP-western or capture immunoassay), and the free and protein associated psDNA. We agree that the methods described above would demonstrate the degree of conjugation. In the creation of our oligo we not only changed the phosphodiester bonds to the phosphorothioate bonds, but also included a 3' biotin modification (Figure 1a and Figure 1-source data 1). As the 5' end of the oligo was covalently linked to the protein this allowed us to use the 3' biotin for detection of the oligo. If the oligo was degraded the 3' biotin would be lost. We used the biotinylation of the DNA tag to validate the conjugation of ova to the psDNA as an alternative to FISH. We detected both ova and psDNA within the same location of cells (Figures 1e and Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1c) and within the same cells using flow cytometry (Figure 1d and Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1). Finally, we demonstrated that the protein and the DNA (via detection of the biotin) are lost from BMDCS over the 7 day time period (Figure 1d) in line with what we show in (Figure 1g-loss of antigen presentation). We hope the reviewer will agree that these assays, while not all of the exact methodology suggested above, address the questions raised. It would be ideal to include a macrophage in the analysis as a highly degradative cells in comparison to the dendritic cell and LEC, that maybe more specialized to regain intact proteins. We appreciate this comment and included in vitro analysis of bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM)s and in Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1g to supplement our BMDC and LEC data. We do indeed find that in vitro cultured macrophages take up a significant amounts of ova-psDNA and process the psDNA more efficiently than the ovalbumin. We hypothesize this is due to higher levels of DNAse II within the lysosomes of macrophages required for the degradation of chromosomal DNA found within apoptotic cells (PMID: 12181746,17979851). We have included this in the text lines:101-105.

However, they frequently induce cardiotoxicity leading to dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure. This study sought to investigate the role of the exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (EPAC) in Dox-induced cardiotoxicity and the potential cardioprotective effects of EPAC inhibition. We show that Dox induces DNA damage and cardiomyocyte cell death with apoptotic features. Dox also led to an increase in both cAMP concentration and EPAC1 activity. The pharmacological inhibition of EPAC1 (with CE3F4) but not EPAC2 alleviated the whole Dox-induced pattern of alterations. When administered in vivo, Dox-treated WT mice developed a dilated cardiomyopathy which was EPAC1 knock-out (KO) mice. Moreover, EPAC1 inhibition potentiated Dox-induced cell death in several human cancer cell lines. Thus, EPAC1 inhibition appears as a potential therapeutic strategy to limit Dox-induced cardiomyopathy without interfering with its antitumoral activity. - - Cell Biology - Chromosomes and Gene Expression Checkpoint activation after DNA damage causes a transient cell cycle arrest by suppressing cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). However, it remains largely elusive how cell cycle recovery is initiated after DNA damage. In this study, we discovered the upregulated protein level of MASTL kinase hours after DNA damage. MASTL promotes cell cycle progression by preventing PP2A/B55-catalyzed dephosphorylation of CDK substrates. DNA damage-induced MASTL upregulation was caused by decreased protein degradation, and was unique among mitotic kinases. We identified E6AP as the E3 ubiquitin ligase that mediated MASTL degradation. MASTL degradation was inhibited upon DNA damage as a result of the dissociation of E6AP from MASTL. E6AP depletion reduced DNA damage signaling, and promoted cell cycle recovery from the DNA damage checkpoint, in a MASTL-dependent manner. Furthermore, we found that E6AP was phosphorylated at Ser-218 by ATM after DNA damage and that this phosphorylation was required for its dissociation from MASTL, the stabilization of MASTL, and the timely recovery of cell cycle progression. Together, our data revealed that ATM/ATR-dependent signaling, while activating the DNA damage checkpoint, also initiates cell cycle recovery from the arrest. Consequently, this results in a timer-like mechanism that ensures the transient nature of the DNA damage checkpoint. "}
