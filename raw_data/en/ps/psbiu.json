The drug price negotiation provisions of the IRA run headlong into the goals of the Orphan Drug Act (ODA), a federal statute designed to encourage manufacturers to invest in new therapies for rare diseases. Over the last forty years, American patients have benefited from the highly effective incentives the ODA put in place, which spurred companies to focus research and development investment on small populations of patients with significant unmet need. The passage of the ODA accelerated innovation leading to more than 600 medicines treating 1,000 rare conditions today, including cancers. Yet, the vast majority of the 7,000 known rare conditions still have no approved treatments, and continued innovation for small indications is at risk under the IRA. Dave Fredrickson, Executive Vice President, Oncology Business Unit, AstraZeneca, said: \"Rare disease and cancer patients depend upon high-risk, low-probability drug development that takes many years to develop and aims for cure. If today's version of the law stands, patients in the United States with rare conditions, who have benefited from the Orphan Drug Act, will get delayed access to scientific breakthroughs relative to other parts of the world.\" Recently, an article in [Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) Network Open](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fjamanetwork.com%2Fjournals%2Fjamanetworkopen%2Ffullarticle%2F2808362&esheet=53544728&newsitemid=20230824228748&lan=en-US&anchor=Journal+of+the+American+Medical+Association+%28JAMA%29+Network+Open&index=1&md5=560dc3c1c3854df5588508096dd981da) stated similar concerns. Many cancer medicines in the US launch first in an orphan indication and broaden use over time to additional populations. One example is LYNPARZA\u00ae (olaparib), a small-molecule cancer medicine approved in 2014 in the US for a small group of late-line ovarian cancer patients. Additional trials added small groups of breast and pancreatic cancer patients, with the most recent indication in prostate cancer approved just this year - nine years later. If the IRA had been in place, significant disincentives would have existed for pursuing the late-line ovarian cancer approval in the US, an indication which has benefited patients in great need of this unique medicine for their rare condition. Another example is SOLIRIS\u00ae (eculizumab) which has received approval to treat four rare diseases, including debilitating and potentially life-threatening neuromuscular and hematological diseases. First approved in 2007 in paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH), a rare chronic blood disorder, historic dynamics enabled continued research investment to support further innovation, resulting in a US approval more than a decade later in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), a rare, autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system. The IRA would have deterred the continued development of this life-changing medicine for patients with rare diseases beyond its initial indication. Correcting these issues and protecting medicines like LYNPARZA and SOLIRIS from price-setting will have minimal impact on the overall cost to the US healthcare system but a tremendous impact on patients. As a result, AstraZeneca has taken the step of filing a legal challenge to aspects of the IRA, to protect timely access to medicines for orphan indications in the US. Notes INDICATIONS & IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR SOLIRIS\u00ae (eculizumab) INDICATIONS What is SOLIRIS? SOLIRIS is a prescription medicine used to treat: - patients with a disease called Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH). - adults with a disease called neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) who are anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody positive. It is not known if SOLIRIS is safe and effective in children with PNH, gMG, or NMOSD. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION What is the most important information I should know about SOLIRIS? SOLIRIS is a medicine that affects your immune system and can lower the ability of your immune system to fight infections. - SOLIRIS increases your chance of getting serious and life-threatening meningococcal infections that may quickly become life-threatening and cause death if not recognized and treated early. - You must receive meningococcal vaccines at least 2 weeks before your first dose of SOLIRIS if you are not vaccinated. - If your doctor decided that urgent treatment with SOLIRIS is needed, you should receive meningococcal vaccination as soon as possible. - If you have not been vaccinated and SOLIRIS therapy must be initiated immediately, you should also receive two weeks of antibiotics with your vaccinations. - If you had a meningococcal vaccine in the past, you might need additional vaccination. Your doctor will decide if you need additional vaccination. - Meningococcal vaccines reduce but do not prevent all meningococcal infections. Call your doctor or get emergency medical care right away if you get any of these signs and symptoms of a meningococcal infection: headache with nausea or vomiting, headache and fever, headache with a stiff neck or stiff back, fever, fever and a rash, confusion, muscle aches with flu-like symptoms, and eyes sensitive to light. Your doctor will give you a Patient Safety Card about the risk of meningococcal infection. Carry it with you at all times during treatment and for 3 months after your last SOLIRIS dose. It is important to show this card to any doctor or nurse to help them diagnose and treat you quickly. SOLIRIS is only available through a program called the SOLIRIS REMS. Before you can receive SOLIRIS, your doctor must enroll in the SOLIRIS REMS program; counsel you about the risk of meningococcal infection; give you information and a Patient Safety Card about the symptoms and your risk of meningococcal infection (as discussed above); and make sure that you are vaccinated with the meningococcal vaccine and, if needed, get revaccinated with the meningococcal vaccine. Ask your doctor if you are not sure if you need to be revaccinated. SOLIRIS may also increase the risk of other types of serious infections. Certain people may be at risk of serious infections with gonorrhea. Certain fungal infections (Aspergillus) may occur if you take SOLIRIS and have a weak immune system or a low white blood cell count. Who should not receive SOLIRIS? Do not receive SOLIRIS if you have a meningococcal infection or have not been vaccinated against meningitis infection unless your doctor decides that urgent treatment with SOLIRIS is needed. Before you receive SOLIRIS, tell your doctor about all of your medical conditions, including if you: have an infection or fever, are pregnant or plan to become pregnant, and are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if SOLIRIS will harm your unborn baby or if it passes into your breast milk. Tell your doctor about all the vaccines you receive and medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements which could affect your treatment. It is important that you have all recommended vaccinations before you start SOLIRIS, receive 2 weeks of antibiotics if you immediately start SOLIRIS, and stay up-to-date with all recommended vaccinations during treatment with SOLIRIS. If you have PNH, your doctor will need to monitor you closely for at least 8 weeks after stopping SOLIRIS. Stopping treatment with SOLIRIS may cause breakdown of your red blood cells due to PNH. Symptoms or problems that can happen due to red blood cell breakdown include: drop in the number of your red blood cell count, drop in your platelet count, confusion, kidney problems, blood clots, difficulty breathing, and chest pain. What are the possible side effects of SOLIRIS? SOLIRIS can cause serious side effects including serious infusion-related reactions. Tell your doctor or nurse right away if you get any of these symptoms during your SOLIRIS infusion: chest pain, trouble breathing or shortness of breath, swelling of your face, tongue, or throat, and feel faint or pass out. If you have an infusion-related reaction to SOLIRIS, your doctor may need to infuse SOLIRIS more slowly, or stop SOLIRIS. The most common side effects in people with PNH treated with SOLIRIS include: headache, pain or swelling of your nose or throat (nasopharyngitis), back pain, and nausea. The most common side effects in people with NMOSD treated with SOLIRIS include: common cold (upper respiratory infection), pain or swelling of your nose or throat (nasopharyngitis), diarrhea, back pain, dizziness, flu like symptoms (influenza) including fever, headache, tiredness, cough, sore throat, and body aches, joint pain (arthralgia), throat irritation (pharyngitis), and bruising (contusion). Tell your doctor about any side effect that bothers you or that does not go away. These are not all the possible side effects of SOLIRIS. For more information, ask your doctor or pharmacist. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA. Visit MedWatch, or call 1-800-FDA-1088.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR LYNPARZA\u00ae (olaparib) CONTRAINDICATIONS There are no contraindications Myelodysplastic Syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukemia (MDS/AML): Occurred in approximately 1.5% of patients exposed to LYNPARZA monotherapy, and the majority of events had a fatal outcome. The median duration of therapy in patients who developed MDS/AML was 2 years (range: <6 months to >10 years). All of these patients had previous chemotherapy with platinum agents and/or other DNA-damaging agents, including radiotherapy. Do not start LYNPARZA until patients have recovered from hematological toxicity caused by previous chemotherapy (Grade 1). Monitor complete blood count for cytopenia at baseline and monthly thereafter for clinically significant changes during treatment. For prolonged hematological toxicities, interrupt LYNPARZA and monitor blood count weekly until recovery. If the levels have not recovered to Grade 1 or less after 4 weeks, refer the patient to a hematologist for further investigations, including bone marrow analysis and blood sample for cytogenetics. Discontinue LYNPARZA if MDS/AML is confirmed. Pneumonitis: Occurred in 0.8% of patients exposed to LYNPARZA monotherapy, and some cases were fatal. If patients present with new or worsening respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, and fever, or a radiological abnormality occurs, interrupt LYNPARZA treatment and initiate prompt investigation. Discontinue LYNPARZA if pneumonitis is confirmed and treat patient appropriately. Venous Thromboembolism (VTE): Including severe or fatal pulmonary embolism (PE) occurred in patients treated with LYNPARZA. In the combined data of two randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies (PROfound and PROpel) in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (N=1180), VTE occurred in 8% of patients who received LYNPARZA, including pulmonary embolism in 6%. In the control arms, VTE occurred in 2.5%, including pulmonary embolism in 1.5%. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and treat as medically appropriate, which may include long-term anticoagulation as clinically indicated. Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, LYNPARZA can cause fetal harm. Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating treatment. Females Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months following the last dose. Males Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential or who are pregnant to use effective contraception during treatment and for 3 months following the last dose of LYNPARZA and to not donate sperm during this time.
