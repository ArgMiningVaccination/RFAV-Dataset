National MS Society chapters all over the country usually organize to ease the impact of local emergencies. The Society has crisis plans, just as individuals should. You're used to being in a certain environment and knowing how to manage there. A disaster can change that. You might need to ask for help putting your home back in order or filling out forms for disaster-relief agencies \u2014 things you would have done independently beforehand. You, your carepartner or family members might experience anxiety, irritability, depression, isolation or guilt after an ordeal. Flashbacks, anger and sleep disruption are common. You might experience physical changes, too, including weakness, numbness or tingling, a heavy feeling in the arms, tremors, fatigue or an increase in allergies, colds or flu. There might also be mental changes, including poor concentration, confusion, slowed thinking, forgetfulness and reduced ability to make decisions or to express yourself as you normally would. Many of these symptoms are the same as an exacerbation of MS. If you experience any of them, consult your healthcare provider.
