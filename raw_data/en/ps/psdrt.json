Low - normal estradiol is consistent with symptoms of estrogen deficiency ( e.g. hot flashes, night sweats, vaginal dryness, memory lapses, sleep disturbances). Consider low dose bioidentical es trogen replacement therap y (assuming no history of/risk for estrogen - sensitive cancers such as the breast or uterus) in combination with nat ural progesterone. Progesterone is within range. Reported symptoms suggest estrogen deficiency (i.e. hot flashes, night sweats). It would be wor thwhile to consider progesterone supplementation, as it often helps balance symptoms of both estrogen dominance and estrogen deficienc y . T estosterone is within range and symptoms of androgen imbalance are minimal. DHEAS is lower than the expected age range. Chronic low DHEAS may suggest H P A axis dysfunction, part icularly if cortisol is a lso low and symptoms are indicative of low adrenal function. DHEAS is highest during the late teens to early twe nties (10 - 20 ng/ml) and d rops steadily with age to the lower end of range by age 70 - 80 (2 - 9 ng/ml). Mid - life DHEAS levels in both males and fema les are usually in the ra nge of 5 - 8 ng/ml. Low DHEAS may contribute to low androgen symptoms (decreased libido, depression, fatigue, memory lap ses, and/or bone loss), s ince DHEAS is a testosterone precurso r . In individuals very low DHEAS (< 2 ng/ml), DHE A supplementation in the 5 - 25 mg dosing range usually raises DHEAS to levels seen in mid - life. Morning cortisol is high, but levels drop to normal the remainder of the da y . The high morning corti sol seen in these test re sults may indicate a situational stressor (emotional, physical) or low blood sugar level (hypoglycemia), which often occu rs in the morning after o vernight fasting. Acute situational stressors (e.g., anxiety over unresolved situations, travel, work - related problems , wedding, holiday season , etc.) can raise cortisol levels, which is a normal response to the stresso r . Symptoms commonly associated with high cortisol include sugar cr aving, fatigue, sleep disturbances, anxiet y , and depression. If cortisol remains elevated throughout the day (usuall y associated with a high night cortisol) and over a prolonged period of time (months/years) excessive breakdown of normal tissues (muscle wasting , thinning of skin, bone loss) and immune suppression can eventually result. For additional information about strategies for supporting adrenal health and reduc ing stress(ors), the following books are worth reading: \" Adrenal Fatigue \" , by James L. Wilson, N.D., D.C., Ph.D.; \" The Co rtisol Connection \" , by Sh awn T albott, Ph.D.; \" The End of Stress As W e Know It \" by Bruce McEwen; \" A wakening Athena \" by Kenna Stephenson, MD . Free T4 and free T3 are within normal ranges. TSH is high. Although most laboratories have a TSH range of 0.35 - 5.50, new studies are finding that the mean and median value s are 1.0 - 1.5mU/l . TSH levels >3.0 are now considered abnormal due to changes by the endocrinology associ ation - see ww w .aace.com for more information. Some experts believe that TSH should be kept below 2.0 for optimal health. Elevated TSH is often associated with symptoms of hypothyrodism, which include fatigue, decreased stamina, depression, rheumatic pain, sleep disturban ces, cold extremities or feeling cold, reduced body temperature, brittle nails, dry coarse hai r , hair loss, infertilit y , low libido, pu f fy eyes and face, decreased sweating, menorrhagia, and/or constipation. Periodic TSH monitoring is recommended if clinical symptoms of thyroid deficien cy persist. T3 results ma y help guide treatment decisions. Thyroid therapy may be worthwhile considering if T4 and/or T3 are low and sympt oms of thyroid deficiency are problematic. Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies are low indicating that Hashimoto's "}
