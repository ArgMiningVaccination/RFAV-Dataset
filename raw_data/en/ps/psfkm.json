The doctor of acupuncture and Chinese medicine said it helped calm down the colicky infant. Dulberg has long been a believer in the power of acupuncture, which involves inserting needles at various places on the body to stimulate so-called acupoints aimed at correcting imbalances in energy. Her first experience was as a college freshman in Arizona when she sought out the treatment for chronic back pain. [TAO PORCHON-LYNCH: World's oldest yoga [RANDY PATTERSON: homeless to $1M businesswoman](https://www.lohud.com/story/news/2018/01/24/rock-n-roll-doula-how-randy-patterson-turned-her-passion-into-profit/1063079001/) A few treatments in, \"the pain just went away,\" recalls the owner of Two Rivers Acupuncture & Wellness in Nyack. Americans spent more than $30.2 billion for adults and $1.9 billion for children out-of-pocket on complementary health approaches, per a 2016 analysis by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These approaches include a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products such as herbal supplements, acupuncture, chiropractic, and yoga. The wellness industry has seen unprecedented commercialization in recent years. And it leaves the public to sift through the various fads out there: from inserting egg-shaped jade rocks into the vagina for better reproductive health as popularized by Gwenyth Platrow's lifestyle website GOOP to consuming Sex Dust, a blend of herbs to ignite your creative energy. \"The general public has a hard time deciphering the difference between someone who might be a health coach with a few hundred hours of online training and no actual clinical experience versus someone who is trained medically,\" said Dulberg. After college, Dulberg, who grew up in New City, spent about five years teaching yoga, travelling in Asia and working as a real estate broker in New York City, before deciding to pursue her passion. In her early 30s, while enrolled at the Pacific College of Oriental Medicine in New York, she was diagnosed with polycystic ovarian disease. \"I was told by a doctor, an endocrinologist, that I will never have kids. And of course, I was devastated,\" said Dulberg. \"Another doctor said IVF may or may not work.\" This time, acupuncture helped pave the way to motherhood. \"I went through two pregnancies, one with a 11-pound baby and another, with a 9-pound baby and because I had fixed my back, I hardly felt any back pain,\" said Dulberg, who now specializes in women's health and fertility. Dulberg began her practice in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 2012 after moving there with her husband. She said the large expat community in the city immediately embraced her practice with word quickly spread through social media and blogs. In 2016, she decided to sell her business and move back to Rockland County to raise her kids. Her patients in Nyack range in age from a 9-month-old baby to an 87-year-old, and come seeking help for a range of ailments from chronic asthma, stomach pain, arthritis, ADHD, anxiety to her most popular specialty of women's health and fertility. Jessica Hans-Smolin of Nyack said she took her then 9-month-old son Llewyn when he started having issues with digestion and sleep. \"It really helped,\" she said. Hans-Smolin, who is 36, said many of her generation are more open to holistic ways of treating ailments and are leery of taking pharmaceuticals with a ton of side-effects. \"We are seeing that people are living longer, so quality of life has become more important to us,\" she said. \"For us, it's about taking preventative steps than curing an illness.\" Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy is the new audience strategist and a member of the Editorial Board for The Journal News/lohud, part of the USA Today Network.
