DOI 10.1002/jor.24230 ABSTRACT: Orthopedic infection (FRI) and periprosthetic joint infection (PJI), remain among the most challenging complications in orthopedic and musculoskeletal trauma surgery. ODRI has been convincingly shown to delay healing, worsen functional outcome and incur signicant socio-economic costs. To address this clinical problem, ever more sophisticated technologies targeting the prevention and/or treatment of ODRI are being developed and tested invitro and in vivo. Among the most commonly described innovations are antimicrobial-coated orthopedic devices, antimicrobial-loaded bone cements and void llers, and dual osteo-inductive/antimicrobial biomaterials. Unfortunately, translation of these technologies to the clinic has been limited, at least partially due to the challenging and still evolving regulatory environment for antimicrobial drug-device combination products, and a lack of clarity in the burden of proof required in preclinical studies. Preclinical in vivo testing (i.e.animal studies) represents a critical phase of the multidisciplinary effort to design, produce and reliably test both safety and efcacy of any new antimicrobial device. Nonetheless, current in vivo testing protocols, procedures, models, and assessments are highly disparate, irregularly conducted and reported, and without standardization and validation. The purpose of the present opinion piece is to discussbest practices in preclinical in vivo testing of antimicrobial interventions targeting ODRI. By sharing these experience-driven views, weaim to aid others in conducting such studies both for fundamental biomedical research, but also for regulatory and clinical evaluation. /C2232019 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J The of an orthopedic device into patients creates a predisposition and increased susceptibility tofracture-related infection (FRI) and periprosthetic jointinfection (PJI), which we collectively term orthopedicdevice-related infection (ODRI). The two main underly-ing reasons for this are reported to be: (i) the ability ofbacteria to adhere to, and form biolm on or around thedevice and (ii) a decit in host immunological defenses adjacent to the device. Both factors exist for all implanted devices, and so the risk of infection is considered univer-sal for all implanted orthopedic devices. Differences inthe device size, anatomical location, incision or woundsize, underlying co-morbidities, and perhaps predisposinggenetic factors largely account for the variability ininfection rates for specic device classes. Bacterial biolm/microcolony formation is causally central to ODRI (Fig. 1) as it provides contaminatingbacteria protection from host phagocytes and promotes tolerance to antibiotics. The reduced metabolic activityof bacteria deep in the biolm, coupled to potentiallimited penetration of some antibiotics through thebiolm matrix, severely hinders the inhibitory orbactericidal activity of many antibiotics (reviewed inrefs. 1,2). senescent bacte-rial populations in biolms, often called persister cells, are naturally more tolerant to antibiotics, 3and are considered critical in the high recurrence rate ofODRI. The combined presence of a foreign body andbacteria prompts dysregulation of the local immuneresponse, 4over and above the reduced phagocytic activity of host endogenous neutrophils in the presenceof foreign materials. These concepts were rst charac-terized by Zimmerli and Gristina in the 1980s. 5-7 Indicative of this phenomenon, tissue beds adjacent toexperimentally-implanted devices have been shown toharbor viable microcolonies of pathogenic bacteria for prolonged periods, 8including inside macrophages after phagocytosis.9More recently, bacteria have been shown to also reside within bone canaliculi, whichmay be a crucial factor in the failure of treatmentwithout extensive debridement. 10Grant Published Inc. JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH1FEBRUARY 2019 271Considering the risks and mechanisms of infection development around implanted orthopedic devices,coupled to an increasing number of surgically placedorthopedic devices expected globally over the comingdecades, 11there is a clear need for improved technolo- gies to prevent, diagnose and treat ODRI.2,12The established pathway to clinical implementation for any anti-infective technology proceeds from preclinical (in vitro and in vivo) testing followed by clinical evalua-tion. As increasing numbers of publications emergeevaluating antimicrobial devices, and as the regula-tory requirements for preclinical evaluation of antimi-crobial technologies evolve, a notable variety ofapproaches are taken to demonstrate preclinical ef-cacy of these technologies. 13,14With recent reviews describing best practices in testing antimicrobial tech-nologies focusing upon in vitro approaches, 15the need exists for analogous guidance in standardizing preclin- ical in vivo models of ODRI. The recommendations herein are assembled by experienced researchers inthe eld of in vivo evaluation of ODRI-targetingtechnologies, sharing their expert opinion on bestpractice in areas such as model selection, study design,data interpretation, and targets for efcacy. Wherepossible, minimum criteria are indicated that weconsider mandatory for all testing, in addition to otherfeatures that may be desirable or appropriate for onlycertain subsets of studies. PREREQUISITES TO IN VIVO STUDIES Since inducing an ODRI has potential for imposing asignicant burden on the experimental animal, in vivostudies should only be performed when certain prereq-uisites are established, a thorough and comprehensiveliterature search has been conducted, and supportivein vitro studies are either completed or shown to beinadequate to address the research question at hand.A comprehensive review of in vitro testing methodolo-gies has recently been published, 15to serve as a useful roadmap for testing of antimicrobial technologies priorto considering an in vivo study. A shortlist of in vitro testing recommended prior to a preclinical in vivostudy is shown in Table 1. A legal requirement prior to commencing preclinical in vivo testing is, of course, ethical approval, details ofwhich must be reported upon publication. Any institu-tional review board (IRB) or institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC) will demand a clearly described hypothesis, with a justication for the studyand the chosen animal species/model, accompanied byan appropriate power analysis for sample size. Thedetails for animal husbandry, the surgical procedures,anesthesia, analgesia, perioperative monitoring proto-cols by qualied personnel and clearly dened humaneendpoints are equally important for a robust animalwelfare protocol. For many studies in the eld, appro-priate control groups are mandated, including positiveand negative controls or an already commercially available product. Russell and Burch's 3 R's (Reduce, Rene, and Replace) remain imperative for improvinglaboratory animal treatment and utilization whileensuring scientic quality and rigor in research usinganimals. 16A relatively recent initiative, the PREPARE guidelines,17are a useful resource to ensure adequate practices and planning. Their application to the studydesign should help gain ethical approval. Importantly,the gain of knowledge should justify the expectedburden of the involved animals and consider the 3R'sprinciples. 16 RATIONALE SUPPORTING ANIMAL EXPERIMENTATION Despite abundant reports of in vitro evidence for antimicrobial efcacy, comparatively few in vitroresults have been shown to translate reliably to invivo antimicrobial efcacy. 18Numerous examples exist of how in vitro data can be misleading when it comesto in vivo testing, which have been reviewed else-where. 14,18Some prominent examples include biolm formation, whereby in vitro grown biolms in various Figure 1.

JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH1FEBRUARY 2019culture media alter microbial growth kinetics and lack the host derived proteins which may account for muchof the biomass of a biolm in vivo. The addition of hostproteins to in vitro systems addresses this issue to acertain degree, however, the complexity of the in vivosituation is not entirely replicated. In fact, biolm forming ability in vitro has never been conrmed to match biolm formation in vivo. In vivo trials have the benet of allowing the evaluation of novel candidate antimicrobial technolo-gies in controlled in vivo conditions that isolate theeffect of the investigated technology from any num-ber of potential confounding factors expected to bepresent in any actual human patient population.Admittedly, not all in vivo experimental conditionsare comparable, and intrinsic differences betweenanatomy, physiology and immune systems in humans and laboratory animals are a recognized limitation that should not be underestimated in translation.The natural resistance of laboratory animals toclinically relevant human pathogens remains incom-pletely understood and represents a weak point inthe interpretation of interventional studies targeting ODRI. For example, it can be difcult to establish aninfection in rodents since they are far less susceptibleto clinically relevant human pathogens like S. au- reus. However, this is strain-dependent and requires further study to understand if and why this is a true phenomenon. Preclinical in vivo testing is nevertheless demanded by regulatory bodies for safety and efcacy evaluationof antimicrobial devices prior to any possible applica-tions for trial use in humans (e.g. General Consider-ations for Animal Studies for Medical Devices,USFDA). ISO guidelines also exist for certain aspectsof these studies (ISO 10993-2: Biological evaluation ofmedical devices Part 2: Animal welfare requirements).The benets and limitations of preclinical in vivomodels of infection are summarized in Table 2.

One of the most basic design questions, which should beconrmed at the outset, is whether the device isintended to support the prevention of infection(prophylaxis), or alternatively, the treatment ofinfection (therapy). In many respects, the preven-tion of infection and the treatment of establishedinfection are signicantly different (Table 3), andthis will largely dictate many aspects of the idealpreclinical evaluation and data sought from such studies. Against a background of relatively low infection rates for elective procedures, many inter-ventions target the prevention of infection in allpatients to make a compelling business case fordevelopment. Establishi ng prophylactic efcacy, however, in a clinical trial may be a prohibitivelyexpensive proposition for the traditional hardwaremanufacturers active in the orthopedic space. Thisis because of the high numbers of enrolled patientsrequired to show a reduction in infection from a lowbaseline of approximately 1% infection rate. This dilemma remains unresolved at the present time and has contributed to the failure to translate manyof the large number of scientic advances regularlyseen in the scientic literature. 14 There is a life-long risk for late-developing infec- tions, as may occur via a hematogenous route. Toprevent such infections, an anti-infective technologywould need to retain activity over the entire life-timeof the implant. To our knowledge, no animal ODRImodel has recapitulated this scenario, although itwould represent a valuable model to determine the role of, for example, antibiotic prophylaxis prior to dental procedures. In the treatment of an established infection, it is also challenging to identify the appropriate time toallow an infection to develop prior to treatment. Theclinical view may be that the ideal experimentalinfection model should produce clinical symptoms ofinfection similar to the targeted clinical situation.These symptoms can range from pain, weight loss, andradiographic loosening of the implant, to redness,swelling, or drainage of the incisional site. The deci-sion on how long to let an infection develop prior to intervention will likely be a balance between animal welfare and clinical symptoms, and should be judgedon a case-by-case basis knowing that the more chronic the infection, the more convincing (but also the morechallenging) will be the intervention that successfullyresolves that infection. A standard approach towardtreatment will in most cases compare current goldstandard with and without the novel intervention. Inmany cases in ODRI, this may involve parenteralantibiotics, unless the intervention explicitly aims toreplace parenteral antibiotic therapy. It is importantto note that euthanasia of animals still receiving systemic or local antimicrobials should be done with caution as false negatives or temporarily reducedbacterial burden may result due to post-mortemactivity of residual antimicrobials (i.e. antibiotic carry-over effects). An antibiotic-free washout period prior toeuthanasia will reduce these concerns, although thepotential rebound in bacterial growth may also mask asub-lethal effect of the material. Nevertheless, the riskof false negative results should outweigh the concernfor a rebound effect in most cases. Model Complexity Recent reviews describe the number of variablesinvolved in selecting appropriate orthopedic bonerepair preclinical models, including species, bonemacro- and micro-structure, bone composition andremodeling, and practical cost, husbandry, species andhandling issues. 19,20Adding infection variables into this experimental preclinical matrix produces substan-tial complexity. A wide range of in vivo ODRI modelsare also available (reviewed in refs. 21,22), rangingfrom the comparatively simple models amenable to most institutions and facilities, 23,24to the more com- plex models requiring more advanced expertise andfacilities 25-27and nally the most complex models where the clinical condition is recapitulated to theclosest extent possible. 28-30Figure 2 outlines the types of animal models available, arranged according tocomplexity and appropriateness to different stages ofproduct development. For clinical translation, models that more closely match the specic clinical condition are clearly pre-ferred and increasingly requested by regulatory bodies.However, the need for such complex models is less clear at the proof of concept stage and may be unnecessary for many basic science studies. In all cases, there Table 3. Summary of the Features Distinguishing Infection Prevention and Treatment Relevant to the Design Goals of Preclinical In Vivo Studies in ODRI. Prevention Treatment Wide range of pathogens and antibiotic resistances possible Broad spectrum antibiotic prophylaxis required Planktonic/low numbers of adherent bacteriaAntimicrobial protection needed over short period in most cases e.g. single shot, or until wound closure/device removal Prevention commences with the surgical procedurePathogen and antibiotic resistance profile known (except culture negative infections) Narrow spectrum antibiotic therapy usually possibleBiofilm formed on the device, intracellular bacteriaAntimicrobial delivery may be required over prolonged period, although required durations poorly defined Treatment is applied later/separate from the surgical procedure274 MORIARTY ET AL. JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH1FEBRUARY 2019remains a necessity to properly justify an in vivo experiment, and the chosen model for its relevance in addressing specic translational questions: animal models should never be used when they cannot effec-tively address a signicant hypothesis. Certain situa-tions, however, may demand a complex model to fullyassess the device even in a basic science study,particularly when the function of that device caninfluence the biology of the surrounding tissues. Forexample, a technology to prevent infection in patientsreceiving a fracture xation device may need to betested in a model that includes a fracture or soft tissuedamage, since biomechanical forces and soft tissue damage influence the healing response of bone, which can also influence host antibacterial defenses. 31,32Simi- larly, fracture models will also allow estimation of theimpact of the technology on fracture healing in additionto the antibacterial efcacy, which is also a key outcomefor both basic science and regulatory approval. In certain cases, the clinical situation may not be reliably or easily replicated in any existing model dueto practical or animal welfare reasons such as dupli-cating certain co-morbidities specic to humans, osteo-porotic conditions, chronic infected burn wounds or diabetic foot osteomyelitis. Of note, certain clinical conditions may also occur naturally in veterinaryclinical practice (e.g. PJI, or infected non-union/pintract infection in pets) and could offer an avenue forefcacy assessment in future. 33,34 In general, animal model selection during product development is driven by the overarching objective inthe preclinical space of de-risking emerging technolo-gies. During the discovery phase, animal models oftenhelp explore and answer hypothesis-driven aims addressing mechanistic concepts. When an early stage technology aligns with an unmet clinical need in the target patient, de-risking becomes a priority. De-risk-ing is driven by a plethora of factors and spans thegamut from economic viability, intellectual property,manufacturing and preclinical safety and efcacy. Thestage of product development usually drives the choiceof preclinical model. For example, generic safetyproles of candidate test articles can be establishedcost-effectively in standard murine models. As thepath of preclinical development advances, the valueproposition of the technology increases, and the clini- cal relevance of the animal model is of increasing importance. For regulatory purposes in the validationof any new technology, the chosen model shouldideally consider the targeted human patient popula-tion and reflect the value-proposition for targetpatients, although this can of course be difcult toachieve or even measure. For orthopedic devices ingeneral (not specically anti-infective devices), theselection of a model may also be influenced by keysafety and performance aspects such as implantfailure modes, duration of the evaluation period, device size, the intended use, and the intended regula- tory strategy. 35This can include consideration of implant dimensions and the surgical approach in theanimal compared to standard human use. For regula-tory submissions, the implantation of the actual deviceas intended for human clinical use may in fact berequired. Sheep or swine models are therefore appro-priate orthopedic animal model choices in this regard,based on implant size alone. Most safety testing for Figure 2. Schematic overview of the increasing complexity possible for testing antimicrobial strategies in preclinical in vivo models of ODRI. Increasing complexity of the model requires greater investment in expertise and instrumentation and may only be required as a technology reaches the late preclinical phase, or the intervention is particularly tied to a clinical situation in the target species.IN VIVO STUDIES OF ODRI 275 JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH1FEBRUARY 2019mechanical devices (e.g. joint and valve replacements) required for FDA IDE/PMA regulatory purposes istherefore conducted in relatively large animals, suchas rabbits, dogs, pigs, goats, sheep, cattle, and largenon-human primates. 20,36 Some human devices are simply too large for application in certain species, and so the ability toproduce and use a smaller, analogous \"copy\" at reason-able cost, and still recapitulate the human situation isimportant. With functional fracture xation implant systems available for mid-size animals such as rab- bits 37and even smaller animals such as rats38and mice,31,39denitive studies may focus on the model with most clinical relevance, rather than on size alone.It should be noted, however, that many types ofmedical devices, including total joint prostheses, areextremely difcult or impractical to miniaturize orapply in animals within reasonable burden limitations.In addition, the miniaturized device may exhibitsignicantly altered behavior (e.g. tissue physiology,failure modes) than the human-sized device. Testing of the functional implant may therefore not be suited to small animals for many devices. Recently, the scientic community and select industry ventures started to embrace naturally occurring diseasemodels in both dogs and horse sw i t ht h er a t i o n a l et h a t their use demonstrates robust superiority over experi-mentally induced models. 40T h el a t e s te f f o r t so fr e n e - ment and optimization of lar ge animal models including genetically modied models is a positive developmenttowards improving reproducibility and scientic rigor.While there is still paucity of available model data pertaining specically to ODRI, the authors encourage i n v e s t i g a t o r st os t a yc u r r e n ti nt h e e l da sm o r er e n e dmodels are being developed and validated. 41 Reporting Animal Care and UseIn vivo ODRI studies exert increased burden upon testanimals over and above non-inoculated equivalents.Animal welfare practices are, therefore, important tofully address and disclose when publishing. A rela-tively recent initiative, the ARRIVE guidelines, 42 provides a useful resource to ensure adequate report-ing. Minimum requirements: all baseline information such as animal species/strain, gender, age, weight, immune status, microbiological status (e.g. specicpathogen-free (SPF), or specic and opportunisticpathogen-free (SOPF)), overall husbandry, detaileddescription of the surgical intervention and veterinarycare, including full anesthesia and analgesia protocolsoften known to affect animal health status and recov-ery should be reported, or made available through theprimary description of the chosen model. The observa-tion parameters used, including contingency plans foraddressing possible complications, and the results thereof, should also be reported. A score sheet is a useful means to objectively report the observation of animals based on clinical parame-ters, but also to dene when an animal should beexcluded from the study (i.e. humane endpoints) and may be adapted to each specic study 43(Table 4). Frequency of scoring should be dened according tothe study phase and must increase if the clinicalcondition warrants it. The full and accurate reportingof animal welfare issues is useful with increasingwelfare demands on the animals for a given model, butalso helps predict or anticipate losses for othersutilizing the model. The clinical parameters andobservations that may be considered as minimum requirements include: vitals, weight loss, wound heal- ing issues, behavioral changes, and any animalsexcluded from the study, including the reason forexclusion (e.g. severe symptoms, found dead, sepsis).Adequate pain management is also critical to disclose,including any pain medication administered in addi-tion to preplanned pain control. Pilot Studies, Validation of ODRI Models, and Historical Controls The reliability and scientic rigor of the experimentaloutcomes in preclinical in vivo studies will be im-proved by using established animal models withknown responses or behaviors under standardized and controlled conditions. Whenever using an animal model for the rst time, developing a new model, oradapting an existing model (e.g. applying a differentpathogen, inoculation dose, time to treatment, or useof a systemic antibiotic), pilot studies are mandated toestablish baseline infection rates as a minimum re-quirement. Pilot studies allow the investigator torene some of the procedures within the study andapproximate the effect size to determine the samplesize for a pivotal study. This can result in lessdiscomfort for the animals and may aid in the reduc- tion of the overall number of animals required. Certain additional prior information on the behavior or performance of a model would be desirable, thoughperhaps less critical to provide a complete understand-ing of the model. For example, it would be valuable toknow whether the original infection persists in themodel of choice or whether it is self-resolving. This isimportant because a number of infection models havebeen described to be self-resolving, mainly for infectionswith low virulence organisms or with high tolerance(rodent) hosts 44and given a certain duration. In such cases, the time point chosen as an endpoint becomes crucial to properly evaluate results. Similarly, it isvaluable to know whether an infection develops orpersists under conditions of conventional clinical pro-phylaxis or treatment. If conventional prophylaxis isadequate in a certain model, the novel technology mayrequire an additional proven benet, such as reducedsystemic toxicity or ease of application, to produce aclear benet to the patient. Disease State and Comorbidities Clinically, the risk of developing ODRI and theseverity of such an infection are impacted by the276 MORIARTY ET AL. JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH1FEBRUARY 2019patient's co-morbidities and it may be a rational strategy to attempt to include these co-morbidities inan animal model for certain studies. Among the most recognized of these co-morbidities are obesity, diabe- tes, immunosuppression, and co-morbidities inorthopedic surgeries, understanding the contributionof these factors to infection initiation and progressionis critical to ameliorating ORDI risk during and aftersurgery. Rodent models have been most frequently employed to study the impact of obesity and diabetes oninfection. High fat diets (HFD) containing 40% orgreater fat content are fed to rodents for 2-4 months to promote increases in adiposity and glucose intoler- ance. Male C57BL/6 mice have traditionally been usedsince they consistently become obese (i.e. greater than30% increase in body mass compared to low fat dietcontrols) and develop metabolic syndrome (i.e. insulinresistance and glucose intolerance) on these diets.Female C57BL/6 mice have less consistent response tothe HFD and are used less often. However, most butnot all commonly available strains also show weightgain and metabolic syndrome on a HFD. 46Choice of mouse strain to employ may be dictated by consistency with prior investigations, in which case C57BL/6 is the likely choice, or by consideration of other geneticcharacteristics of the strain (see below). are classic models for this clinical state. Unfortunately, thedisruption of leptin function has clearly documentedeffects on immune function, including risk of infec-tion. 47,48Thus, these genetic models are inappropriate for studying the mechanisms of obesity-mediatedODRI. Other studies have used obese Zucker rats inbone orthopedic sponta- obese and is an accepted model of metabolic syndrome, sharing many similarities with humans who have this condition, including obesity,dyslipidemia, some insulin resistance, and hypertrigly-ceridemia. No implant infection studies are yetreported with this model. While a suppressed immune system is an obvious co-morbidity leading to increased risk for ODRI, moresubtle differences in the immune state are an impor-tant consideration when selecting a rodent model tostudy infection. Recent evidence suggests that the pro-inflammatory Th1/Th17 response to infection may be more effective in the early planktonic growth phase of an infection and comparatively less so in the chronicbiolm stage. 51In the chronic biolm stage, the anti- inflammatory Th2/Treg immune response seem to bemore effective. For example, C57BL/6 mice show aTh1/Th17-biased response to infection while BALB/cmice show a Th2 and Treg bias. Consistent with thislogic, BALB/c mice have been shown to clear ODRIbiolm infection caused by Staphylococcus aureus more effectively than C57BL/6 mice. 51While these assertions must be conrmed in future studies, the Th1/Th2 balance clearly has relevance in selecting certain animal species and strains for ODRI. Infection and its associated inflammation lead to activation of the coagulation pathways includingdown-regulation of anticoagulation coagu- lation pathways can be interrogated for their contribu-tion to risk or progression of infection through geneticmouse models. For example, in a mouse model of S. aureus ODRI, transgenic overexpression of plasmino- gen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) led to markedly moreTable 4. Steps for Designing a Score Sheet. Task Description Identify the parameters Any publicly available score sheet should not be adopted without prior assessment and adaptation to the specific situation. Please note that re- evaluation of the parameters, e.g. removal of existing parameters oradding missing parameters after the preliminary experiments, may be needed since the score sheets are planned according to symptoms expected prior to the study. Define the method of scoring the parameters A binary system (yes/no; present/not present) or a numerical scoring or a combination of both may be selected. Define exclusion criteria Clinical presentation requiring immediate removal from the study such as fracture, dislocation, severe and rapid weight loss need to be identifiedin both the study protocol and the animal welfare protocol. Scaling rescue strategies such as prolonged analgesia may provide transient relief without catastrophic outcomes while maintaining study integrity. Define the interventions when animals are suffering (humane end points)Interventions can be performed based on the rank of one clinical sign or on the sum of some selected clinical signs. It is helpful to have clinical veterinary support for daily assessments with some of the morechallenging animal models, which may exhibit subtle signs initially. Nothing Abnormal Diagnosed (NAD) A NAD and open slots are necessary to save time and record unscheduled observations, respectively.IN VIVO STUDIES OF ODRI 277 JOURNAL intense brin encapsulation of these abscesses.53Co-morbidity stud- ies emulating this example provide evidence that thecoagulopathy of infection can play a direct role in theinfection process. Additional infection studies usinggenetic disruption of the coagulation cascades withimplant infections are warranted. Outcome Measures In most studies involving ODRI, the primary outcomeis the reduction of infection rate and/or bacteria, but may also be changes in immune responses, or param- eters addressing functional restoration, that is,improvements in fracture healing, bone regeneration,or osseointegration. Clinical signs of infection such aswhite cell count, C-reactive protein, swelling, weightloss or lameness are other measures useful to evaluateoutcome. However, since the intervention may reducethese symptoms in culture-positive animals, clinicalsigns should only be used as a secondary outcomemeasure supporting the more denitive outcome mea-sure provided by quantitative bacterial culture. From a translational standpoint and a value-based health care system, it is important to understand howpreclinical results de-risk and support the value-proposition for the target patient. From a clinicalperspective, complete eradication of infection from theimplant and surrounding tissues and restoration offunction is the ideal target for most anti-infectivetechnologies, the easiest result to interpret, and likelygreatest impact in terms of asserting efcacy. Incontrast, the clinical signicance of, for example, a90% reduction in bacteria is a challenge to interpret, regardless of any statistical differences proven. In vitro studies of antibacterial activity often target a1'000-fold reduction in bacterial as a signicant, yetarbitrary threshold. Also, a 1'000-fold reduction from areference point of 10 7CFU may have different signi- cance in terms of outcome compared with a 1'00-foldreduction from 10 4CFU. At the present time, no generally accepted target has been established for aCFU reduction in in vivo studies. Clearly, completeeradication of infection in all test-treated animalsrepresents an ideal target for many antimicrobial- containing devices, and so should be aimed for from the outset of any study. Any remnant bacteria in atechnology \"merely\" reducing the bacterial load mayhave an impact, but it remains likely that remainingbacteria may proceed to re-establish a biolm-relatedinfection and so is not considered a complete cure. Histological evaluation of outcome is an important assessment, and when performed thoroughly serves asa useful adjunct to culture results, because it may pickup inflammation indicative of infection when cultureresults remain negative. Identifying an animal as infected or not based solely on histological sections is to be undertaken with caution due to the limited sampleareas in traditional histology. A technique combininghistology with molecular detection of pathogens isfluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), which is also a marker for bacterial activity 54(Fig. 3). Conventional histopathology also has a valuable role in monitoringODRI in in vivo studies. Some features of S. aureus infection, such as SACs, as well as peri-implant osteol-ysis and inflammatory cell inltration are best revealedwith conventional histopathology. 55-57 Study Design and Outcome AssessmentIn performing an in vivo study, inherent bias, eitherintentional or unintentional, should be avoided. 58As a minimum, randomization should always be performed,as well as blinding or masking the study personnel togroups/cohorts and treatments when possible. Surgical procedures and certain therapies (e.g. coated implants) are difcult to blind compared to drug therapy, forwhich a placebo is also provided as control. In suchcircumstances, an empty coating or delivery vehiclemay serve as a suitable control. Under circumstanceswhere blinding of the operator (e.g. surgeon) is impos-sible, de-blinding should be done at the latest time-point possible (e.g. just before treatment application)and study design should be masked to the personperforming outcome measurements (e.g. biopsy cultur-ing, histology). Efcacy must also be compared to appropriate positive and negative controls. In many cases, theremay not be an apparent positive clinical control ordened standard of care to compare the experimentaltherapy. This is especially true for more innovativetherapeutic strategies. In such cases, conventionalinterventions such as debridement and systemic anti-biotic may be the best option for a positive control. Anegative control for ODRI may involve debridementalone or implant removal. In an established animalmodel of infection, historical controls may have some value, however, it is highly recommended to include a limited number of additional control animals in eachexperiment to ensure reproducibility of the model. With regards to statistical evaluation, categorical data (e.g. infected vs. not infected) assessed using, forexample, Fisher's Exact Test or Chi Square need robustdifferences between groups or large sample sizes. Addi-tionally, more subtle differences may exist in the levelsof infection. Because of high biological variability in CFUcounts, these values often are not normally distributed,and non-parametrical statistics are indicated. The needfor such clear differences between infected and non- infected animals, is, in par t, why many investigators compare mean/median viable counts to determine differ-ences between groups. For a general review on datatransformation and statistical comparison in in vivostudies, please see the following reviews. 59,60 BACTERIOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF ODRI STUDIES Pathogen SelectionThe clinical manifestation of ODRI may vary depend-ing upon the causative microorganism itself and notjust the host immune response or device type in278 MORIARTY ET AL. JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH1FEBRUARY 2019question. pathogen, its antibiotic suscep- tibility and resistance proles, ability to form biolmand repertoire of virulence factors possessed by thatspecies/strain, are therefore a critical feature of an invivo study. The most commonly reported pathogensreported in clinical studies of ODRI include S. aureus of polymicrobial infec- tions. It is important to note that more virulent species such as S. aureus , and aerobic Gram-negative bacilli are the major causes of early onset infections, whilstdelayed or late infections are commonly caused by lessvirulent species such as coagulase-negative staphylo-cocci (CoNS, e.g. Staphylococcus epidermidis ). 61,62 With regards to specic strain selection, molecular epidemiological studies have begun to reveal the fullextent of genetic diversity within S. aureus and S. epidermidis populations. 63In the past, in vitro and in vivo studies have used American Type Culture Collec- tion (ATCC) or other well-characterized lab strains such as S. aureus ATCC 33591, S. aureus ATCC 49230 (isolated from a patient with chronic osteomyelitis), S. aureus 8325-4, S. aureus ATCC epidermidis ATCC 35983 (RP12); or unique or random clinical isolates such as S. aureus MN864,65and S. epidermidis 1457.66,67At the present time, there appears to be no consensus as to the best strain orrationale for strain selection. Culture collection strainshave value in international access and traceability, and quite often a signicant amount of characteriza- tion including sequencing and performance in in vivomodels. However, there is concern that even clinicalisolates deposited in a culture collection may have lostcertain virulence capabilities, or at least this is achallenge to quantify or certify. Freshly isolated clini-cal isolates therefore have an advantage of beingclosest to the active pathogen when in humans. However, these are lacking in accessibility and compa-rability to other models and may also lose virulenceonce passaged and distributed internationally. In theabsence of clear guidance, it appears that the idealsituation would be to have a basic understanding ofthe clinical background to the strain, match it to theclinical question being modeled, and to know keygenetically encoded virulence factors retained by thebacterium. In case more than one strain is analyzed, considering the use of particular \"benchmark\" strains (still to be selected) might provide better inter-studycomparisons. A key virulence factor of S. aureus and in particular S. epidermidis is the ability to adhere and form biolms directly on implant surfaces, which thenprotects them from antibiotics and the host's immunesystem. 68,69Both S. aureus and S. epidermidis are known use cell-wall-anchored (CWA) adhere to the implantsurface and to host extracellular matrix that coversthe implant. 70-74They then accumulate to form a biolm using various independent mechanisms,namely the factors independent of theicaADBC locus, which include S. aureus cell wall protein G (SasG) and S. epidermidis accumulation associated protein (Aap)77,78; protein (Bap)82; and extracellular DNA (eDNA).83,84 Thus, the fact that closely related isolates can displaydifferent phenotypes and produce the above proteinsdifferently and influence the ability of the S. aureus /S. epidermidis to adhere and form biolms is an impor- tant factor to consider when choosing an isolate for Figure 3. FISH of a tissue section from a subcutaneous implant infection mouse model colonized with coagulase-negative staphylococci. (A) Overview shows the histology of the tissue stained by nucleic acid stain DAPI (blue) and background auto- fluorescence (yellow/green). (B) Higher magnication reveals differential colonization of the tissue with parts with only few bacterialcells and parts with biolms, as detected by the pan-bacterial probe EUB338 (green). Note the difference in FISH-signal intensity in individual bacterial cells (B) corresponding to the ribosome content and therefore activity of the bacteria.IN VIVO STUDIES OF ODRI279 JOURNAL OF vivo studies. An in vivo ODRI study should therefore consider including a characterized bench-mark strain of S. aureus and/or S. epidermidis known to form a biolm by PNAG/PIA and SasG/Aap andAap/SasG production, such as A good summary of the characteristics ofdifferent types of S. aureus isolates, specically methi- cillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains, can be found in the supplementary data of Moneke et al. 85 Antibiotic resistance is another factor in identifying an appropriate pathogen for an in vivo ODRI study.Proling the susceptibility of the selected pathogen toany antibiotic used in the study is essential. Resis-tance of biolms formed by the isolate to the sameantibiotic may also be benecial for many studies,with care taken to report the protocols and methodsused completely. 86,87 The last consideration for the strain/pathogen selec- tion is whether to use fluorescently labelled isolates or bioluminescent isolates that with the proper optical imaging instrumentation can be visualized in situ.88,89 Stable fluorescent-labelling requires genetic manipula-tion of the bacteria which is not always readilyachievable and is particularly problematic when clinicalisolates are being investigated. In any case, the result-ing virulence of the modied pathogen must be com-pared to the unmodied wild-type isolate. Someresearch groups have now developed a variety offluorescent reporter plasmids for labelling S. aureus by utilizing plasmids encoding either green fluorescent protein (GFP) or higher wavelength reporter variants for yellow (YFP) and red (mCherry) labeling. 24,88,90-92 These reporters are placed under control of character-ized promoters to enable constitutive or inducibleexpression using antibiotics such as chloramphenicol,erythromycin, or tetracycline. 90,93While fluorescent strains are very useful for in vitro studies, they havevery limited value for in vivo studies because of the lowintensity of the signal and quenching by the host tissue.In contrast, use of bioluminescent strains in animalmodels of ODRI can provide a longitudinal outcomemeasure of in vivo bacterial growth. 94For therapy studies, bioluminescence can also be used to conrm the establishment of infection before randomizing theanimals into treatment groups 56However, in vitro, it has been shown that although bioluminescent signalscorrelate with planktonic growth, this correlation is lostduring the transition from planktonic to the biolmmode of growth. 95In line with this, any lack of luminescent signal in vivo, or reduction of signal overtime, does not necessarily indicate reduction of viablenumbers of bacteria. 96Apparently, viable bacteria with low metabolic state may persist and go unnoticed because of reduced luminescence. Thus, in vivo inves- tigations of antimicrobial strategies results with biolu-minescent strains should be interpreted with caution.Another point of attention is the localization of theinfection; deep infections are less likely to be reliably monitored than supercial infections due to the differ-ent path length for the emitted light from the bacteria,and (non-physiologically) high numbers of bacteria maybe needed to detect a signal. Inoculum Preparation While often overlooked or sparsely described, inoculumpreparation protocols must be clearly dened, andshould be fully disclosed in reporting or publishinganimal studies of ODRI. This is important as theinfection rate in any model will be related to theinoculum, and the ability to replicate any model acrossdifferent laboratories must rely on this information. The essential minimum information to share includes the total number of colony forming units (CFU)administered to each animal, but also the exactconditions used for preparation of the inoculum forexample, using freshly prepared bacterial inocula orfrozen aliquots, fresh bacteria suspended from colonieson agar plates or harvested from liquid culture, type ofculture media, log phase or stationary phase bacteria,growth media, application of inocula in saline solution,pre-colonized on implants, or deposited with a collagensponge, brin gel or other carrier material. Similarly, it is important to describe the storage conditions, including the time between preparation and adminis-tration of the bacterial inoculum, in addition to themeans used to apply/deliver the bacteria into thetarget tissues, the volume and any method to limit thespread of bacteria in the implant or tissue site. Diagnosis/Definition of Implant Related Infection Preclinical in vivo studies by their nature, offer thepossibility for thorough bacteriological and histologicalevaluations of the experimental animal. Basic knowl-edge of microbiological techniques regarding speciesidentication and quantitative culturing methods is aprerequisite for reliable results. Since normal biologi-cal variation in animal experiments is a known,intrinsic challenge, attention should be directed tostandardized sampling and homogenization or sonica-tion of all samples to obtain reliable CFU counts.Similarly, all sampling locations should be accurately described, recognizing that small biopsies are at risk for missing bacteria; ideally each animal may besampled in its entirety and include both bone and softtissue as well as the implant (after sonication). Formost models, sampling is only possible at a revisionsurgery or post mortem. However, the tissue cagemodel, 23does allow repeat sampling of the tissue cage fluid, which has signicant advantages in terms ofcontinuous monitoring of bacterial burden, immunecells, or extracellular immune mediators. Detection of infecting pathogens on the implant or in the tissues by conventional culture will usually have high sensitivity and specicity. However, clinicalliterature documents culture-negative infections. Thisoccurs when biopsies are culture negative, either due280 MORIARTY ET AL. JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH1FEBRUARY 2019to sample error (not necessarily an issue in animal studies) or due to non-cultivable bacteria in somesituations. 97,98Small colony variants (SCVs), a slow growth rate and atypical colonymorphology, may develop and can only be detected inprolonged cultures. 99According to the current hypoth- esis, bacteria may also enter a viable but non-cultur-able (VBNC) state in particular within biolms, butalso as planktonic bacteria and under antibiotic treat-ment. This VNBC state may render bacteria unable to regrow when deposited on conventional microbiological media. 98This issue may be more prevalent for certain bacterial species, or for patients/animals undergoingantibiotic therapy. However, the exact conditions andmechanisms underlying the VNBC concept remain tobe fully understood, but do represent a possible risk inODRI studies. To maximize chances of accurate cul-ture results, adopting clinical methods towards im-proved isolation and culture of biopsies should also beconsidered, that is, sonication of biopsies and associ-ated hardware components 100,101or the use of known biolm-dispersing agents during sample processing.102 Molecular technologies (e.g. PCR) that amplify bacte- rial DNA in samples have improved the culture- inde-pendent detection and identication of microorganismsin the past years. 103These techniques can be very sensitive and fast but must be thoroughly evaluated forthe respective experimental setting. An efcient DNA-extraction protocol is crucial, and results are often onlysemi-quantitative, because the background of eukaryoticDNA in samples may hamper detection of the relativelyminute amount bacterial DNA. In addition, these techni-ques detect bacterial DNA, but cannot indicate if thebacteria were living or dead at the time of sampling. 104 Since culture as well as amplication-based meth- ods require disintegration of the sample (and therefore disruption of biolms), microscopic techniques are theonly methods to date that can differentiate betweenthe presence of single cells, microcolonies, and biolmsin tissues. 105In addition to Gram staining or immuno- histochemical methods, FISH combines molecular de-tection of microorganisms with fluorescencemicroscopy and has been increasingly used for analy-sis of biolm-associated infections. 103,106,107FISH can be applied to in vitro samples as well as to ex vivosamples from animal models or patients. 108-111Since FISH-probes hybridize ribosomal RNA, the signal intensity correlates to the ribosome content and conse-quently activity of the cells. This allows both visualiza-tion and identication of the microorganisms, and also Figure 4. Abscess tissue from a mouse model infected with Enterococcus sp. (A) Overview shows inltration by granulocytes (DAPI, blue) and bright auto-fluorescent material consistent with plant bers (yellow/green). The insert (B) at higher magnication shows FISH of different bacterial populations colonizing the bers. The identical microscopic eld with separate microscopic channels reveals the strong autofluorescence of the bers (B1, nonsense FISH probe NONEUB338, green), whereas bacteria of different morphologies are detected by the pan-bacterial FISH probe EUB338 (B2, magenta). Only one population is detected by the Enterococcus -specic FISH probe (B3, yellow). DAPI show some cell nuclei in addition to the bacteria (B4, blue). Although the mouse was only inoculated with Enterococcus , FISH revealed a multispecies infection possibly resulting from a gut perforation.IN VIVO STUDIES OF ODRI 281 JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH1FEBRUARY 2019provides information about their spatial distribution and activity in situ112(Fig. 4). FISH can localize and quantify planktonic cells, biolms, or intracellularbacteria and can clarify potential problems such ascontamination and mixed infections, or inoculation inan incorrect compartment (Fig. 4). Consequently,FISH is increasingly used in infection models, 109,111,113 although it is labor intensive and rather restricted tospecialized laboratories. Finally, all bacteriological evaluations should in- volve a method to conrm that the infection observed in vivo is caused specically by the inoculated strainand not another opportunistic host pathogen. In somecases, this may be performed on simple selectivemicrobiological agars and subsequent phenotypicaland/or biochemical characterization. DNA (RAPD)) will not onlyenable conrmation of the species identity of theinfecting isolate, but also the strain and whether itmatches the inoculated strain. Using fluorescently labeled bacterial strains might be a simpler way to conrm the identity of the inoculated strain, althoughco-infecting pathogens should also be ruled out (e.g.ref. 24). ANTIBIOTIC/ANTIMICROBIAL ADMINISTRATION In most preclinical in vivo studies, antimicrobialagents are often administered, either as part of thetechnology being tested, or as conventional adminis-tration as an adjunctive or comparison therapy. Ingeneral, minimal evaluation of the antimicrobial in use may require estimating the loading of the drug in the carrier, its release from the carrier or implant andits quantication in plasma or local tissues. Accurate,reliable estimates of these values require validatedmethods, with known limits of detection, limit ofquantication, specicity, and accuracy in physiologi-cal media. Antibiotic concentrations measured in tis-sue must be carefully considered, with awareness ofthe distinctive partitioning of different antibiotics intodifferent tissue niches and protein binding. 114Systemically AppliedCertain studies may require systemic antibiotic cover-age either prophylactically or therapeutically. The goalof systemic antibiotic therapy may be to mimic humanstandard of care, or to prevent systemic infection.Systemic antibiotic therapy may be particularly appro-priate in testing technologies that provide protection ofthe device, but do not release antimicrobials locally intothe surrounding tissues (e.g. contact-killing or anti-adhesive coatings, bound agents). Administration of systemic antibiotics should be supported by a clear, clinically consistent rationale for antibiotic selection,timing, dosage, route, and frequency. It is desirable tomatch the human clinical condition as closely aspossible to ensure adequate regimens are used. Ofcourse, safety and pharmacokinetics may need to beestablished in advance. Clearance of antibiotic fromsystemic circulation may be different in animals thanin humans, and any study with a signicant systemicantibiotic component, or the use of antibiotics notapproved for animal use should consider a preliminary pharmacokinetic prole analysis. Simultaneously, po- tential (unreported) side effects can be investigated.Persistence of reliable ORDI in the model using sys-temic antibiotic regimens alone must rst be assertedbefore efcacy of any other additional implant-focusedantimicrobial strategies can be distinguished. While clinically relevant, no clear recommendations exist for testing an antimicrobial device in the absenceversus presence of systemic antibiotic therapy. Deci-sions may be best dictated by the clinical problem inquestion, the experience with the animal model, and the expected protective or therapeutic bioactivity of the implant technology. Locally Applied The majority of new antimicrobial technologies appliedto medical devices involve antimicrobial agents re-leased from the implant or carrier. As mentionedabove, the total amount of antimicrobial dosed to eachanimal should be clearly described as a minimum, andan estimation of antimicrobial release (or retention) Table 5.

It is also desirable to know the tissue/serum concentration of the released antimicrobial overtime as well as a measurement of observed toxicities(both local and systemic) associated with local applica-tion of the material or antimicrobial.

There is a risk that these olderpractices persist when these older studies are used asa reference for new studies. Some of the more commonerrors in these studies are shown in Table 5. OUTLOOK FOR BEST PRACTICES The goal of this opinion piece is to present aminimum set of requirements to be considered whenplanning an ODRI animal study. Broad application of these experimental design principles would aid the proper execution of preclinical animal ODRI studiesso that improved results of these studies carrymaximum weight and reliability, can be more easilytransferred between laboratories, and can bettersupport translation of these technologies into clinicalpractice. A list summarizing the key points recom-mended to be reported when publishing such studiesis included as reference for the reader (Table 6).Although many outstanding questions for the eldremain, guidance recommendations for best practices here should prompt further discussion in the ORDI research forum hopefully with the intent to standard-ize and validate these approaches. Importantly,many practices recommended here should also belisted in publications in the eld to reinforce theirvalue. Further methodological renements or moreabsolute policy statements may be achieved viaconsensus between scientic and regulatory agenciesand with careful reporting of future studies withprovisions and details described here as a startingposition. Such collaboration between researchers, regulatory frameworks, and medical device industry could also further clarify and maximize what can bereliably and accurately shown in animal studies andhopefully also minimize what must be shown in aclinical setting. 13,14 Given increasing reports of animal studies investi- gating ODRI from many geographic regions, stepstoward global harmonization microbiological approaches, reporting require-ments, reliability and reproducibility, validation andtranslational value must be considered seriously. 2 Experimental facilities capable of performing in vivo preclinical studies are available across the globe. Hence, the conditions and resources of a researchfacility are not often a major barrier to conductingproperly designed ODRI preclinical studies to safe,acceptable and appropriate standards. Establishingminimum standards in designing and reporting theseODRI preclinical studies might stimulate wide-spread adoption and further, promote needed globalharmonization and understanding of best practices.International guidelines are already available forgoverning animal welfare in medical research, and the antimicrobial implant study related parameters suggested in this document now provide a solidadditional basis for conducting antimicrobial preclini-cal studies in ODRI.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS All authors contributed their research and/or clinicalexpertise during the writing and editing of the manu-script, and all authors have approved the submissionof the nal version.
