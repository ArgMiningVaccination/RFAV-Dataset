No lie, I throw the term 'tincture' around as if everyone else understands me but that is a poor assumption I make. We understand other words related to medicine like a capsule, prescription, herbs, liquid suspension, or syringe. Now put all of that together and you get a tincture! Well not exactly, but in a nutshell, yes! Traditionally, tinctures and teas were the first forms of medicine we had before pills or capsules. It was a way for medicine healers or shamans to preserve medicinal herbs and to give to their community members when they were ill. A tincture usually contains berries, roots, and/or leaves from an herb or tree that has been picked at an optimal time, processed in whichever way extracts the components you want, and then mixed with grain alcohol or glycerin to be preserved. A traditional tincture contains only the liquid extract of the plant(s) and the preservative base and nothing else. This liquid is then placed in a bottle, that is usually brown, or amber, and then administered when needed in times of illness. Now, why an amber bottle? Well, the amber-colored glass is chosen to maintain the freshness of the substance within by protecting it from sunlight. For many years doctors have been using the Boston round amber glass bottles for many medicines and these same bottles remain the standard. Sunlight can degrade certain compounds faster so the amber tint is a protective barrier for the liquid so the constituents stay fresher longer. Some tinctures are stored in clear or blue bottles. A clear bottle is okay too but not ideal as the tincture may not stay as fresh as long. The most common form of preservation of an herb or its parts is with grain alcohol but some are preserved in glycerin, which is a sugary syrup. Which type do you choose? Great question! You would select an alcohol-based tincture because it is generally easier to find and shelf-stable longer after opening. If you are someone who cannot tolerate alcohol or choose to leave alcohol out of your life, a glycerin-based tincture is for you. You would also choose a glycerin-based tincture if this medicine is for a child due to taste and no alcohol. Typically, a glycerin-based tincture is shelf-stable for about 6 months from opening and an alcohol-based tincture can be shelf-stable up to 1-2 years after opening. Now a tincture may contain just one herb or plant or it may contain multiple herbs or parts of plants. For example, let's talk about Echinacea purpura. Echinacea purpura is a perennial plant with a beautiful flower well known for its immune-supportive properties. You can purchase this herb in a dry tea form or in a tincture. Some companies may make it where you can purchase the single herb or blended with other herbs that they have specifically formulated for a particular condition. The blend may have a label such as immune support, or vital immune or some other creative name to target a particular condition. An example of a tincture that is not made from an herb or its parts is Elderberry syrup. Sambucus nigra is the Latin name for a tree. The parts most commonly used from this tree are the flowers, berries, and leaves. When we make Elderberry syrup we use just the berries and not the leaves or flower. The Elderberry is commonly used for immune support during colds and flu whereas the Elderflower is used for things like upper respiratory and sinus infections to name a few. When administering a tincture, most smaller 1 or 2-ounce brown glass bottles will come with a dropper attached to the rubber cap top. Some companies now have labeled the dropper with lines that show where about 0.25mL to 1mL would be but most do not and that is okay. A full dropper is approximately 20 drops. A full dropper is not what you see physically but full when you squeeze the rubber top and suction up as much of the tincture into the dropper as possible. When you do this you will notice that the whole dropper will not fill but rather about 3/4 full and this is correct, you are not crazy, that is just the max amount you can suction up into the dropper. When taking the tincture, it is ideal to place it directly into your mouth or on your tongue and let it sit for a few seconds then swallow. This form of administration ensures you are getting the maximum dosage and it goes systemically throughout your body quicker. Have you ever tasted a tincture? Yes, some are not so easy to swallow on its own, I do not disagree. In cases where the taste is not as tolerable, you can add the tincture to a juice or water and swallow. For young children, I find that using a syringe is easiest for administration or putting it in a small amount of juice. Now, why would I not talk about tinctures and not leave you with some of my favorites! I always have a select few tinctures in my home for me and my family. I have 2 small children that contract illnesses at daycare and school often so having my favorites on hand can be game-changers.
