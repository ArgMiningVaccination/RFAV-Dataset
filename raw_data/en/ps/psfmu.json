The scope for raising margins in dairy herds by improving fertility and health. ). It is defined as a superficial inflammation of the endometrium ( [Sheldon et al., 2006b](#bib41) - Sheldon I.M. - Wathes D.C. - Dobson H. The management of bovine reproduction in elite herds. ) and is characterized by the presence of a purulent (>50% pus) uterine discharge detectable in the vagina at 21 DIM or by a mucopurulent (approximately 50% pus and 50% mucus) discharge detectable in the vagina at 26 DIM ( [Sheldon et al., 2006a](#bib39) - Sheldon I.M. - Lewis G.S. - LeBlanc S. - Gilbert R.O. Defining postpartum uterine disease in cattle. ). A wide variety of treatments for endometritis have been reported and discussed controversially among veterinary practitioners ( [LeBlanc et al., 2002a](#bib26) - LeBlanc S.J. - Duffield - Leslie K.E. - Bateman K.G. - Keefe G.P. - Walton J.S. - Johnson W.H. Defining and diagnosing postpartum clinical endometritis and its impact on reproductive performance in dairy cows. ). These therapies include the local or systemic administration of antibiotics or application of hormones (i.e., PGF2 ; [LeBlanc et al., 2002b](#bib27) - LeBlanc S.J. - Duffield T.F. - Leslie K.E. - Bateman K.G. - Keefe G.P. - Walton J.S. - Johnson W.H. The effect of treatment of clinical endometritis on reproductive performance in dairy cows. ). Relevant issues for discussion regarding endometritis are the diagnostic criteria, criteria for treatment or nontreatment, efficacy of therapies, and expected reproductive performance ( [LeBlanc et al., 2002b](#bib27) - LeBlanc S.J. - Duffield - Leslie K.E. - Bateman K.G. - Keefe G.P. - Walton J.S. - Johnson W.H. The effect of treatment of clinical endometritis on reproductive performance in dairy cows. ). Effective programs for the prevention or reduction of uterine infections have not been implemented successfully on many farms ( ). Thus, the overall incidence of endometritis has not improved significantly over the last 35 yr ( [Griffin et al., 1974](#bib21) - Griffin J.F.T. - Hartigan P.J. - Nunn W.R. Non-specific uterine infection and bovine fertility. I. Infection patterns and endometritis during the first seven weeks postpartum. ; [Sheldon et al., 2002](#bib40) - Sheldon D.E. - Rycroft A.N. - Pfeiffer D.U. - Dobson H. Influence of uterine bacterial contamination after parturition on ovarian dominant follicle selection and follicle growth and function in cattle. ). In the United States, the health care of organic livestock has to be facilitated by vaccines and other veterinary biological products ( ). Only if these interventions are inadequate is administration of synthetic medications, as listed in the National Organic Regulation, allowed. In Europe, the use of veterinary medical products for organic livestock production is regulated by European Council Regulation (EEC) 2092/91 Annex 1, B 5.4 ( ). According to this regulation, the use of phytotherapeutic products, homeopathic products, and trace elements should be preferred to the use of chemically synthesized allopathic veterinary medicinal products or antibiotics, provided they are efficacious for the intended species and condition ( ). Hence, the challenge for the practitioner is to assess, for any given case, whether an alternative treatment or a conventional medication should be used. The most critical problem is that little scientific evidence is available concerning the efficacy of phytotherapeutic and homeopathic remedies in farm animals ( ). Without science-based data, however, it is impossible to comply with legal requirements and implement efficacious therapies. Homotoxicology is a complementary and alternative therapy that uses homeopathically diluted remedies with the intent to eliminate toxins from the body ( ). The expression \"alternative therapy\" indicates that the intervention does not follow generally accepted medical methods and, recently, that it may not have a scientific explanation for its effectiveness. Recommendations for the treatment of bovine endometritis with homotoxicological drugs often do not refer to valid scientific data but to personal experience ( [Dorenkamp, 1991](#bib5) Puerperalerkrankungen. ). In one of the few field trials on homeopathic treatment of bovine endometritis, [Boitor et al., 1994](#bib2) - Boitor I. - Bogdan M.L. - Ghitulescu C. - Bogdan I. Einsatz der Homoeopathika us. vet. bei compositum ad us. vet. bei Ovarialzysten beim Rind. included 57 cows with puerperal endometritis and treated 27 animals with 10 mL of Lachesis compositum (comp. ) ad usum (us. ) veterinarium (vet. ) subcutaneously. The control group received an intrauterine treatment with an undefined formulation and dose of oxytetracycline (n = 30). The authors found a significantly improved involution of the uterus, enhanced phagocytosis, and fewer days open (85 vs. 140 d) in study cows compared with control cows. This study, however, had significant deficiencies, such as a small number of animals, a lack of randomization and blinding, and missing definitions for the particular types and times of treatments. Information on the selection and allocation of animals and statistical procedures were also not provided. In a randomized, controlled, blinded trial, Traumeel ad us. vet., Lachesis comp., and Carduus comp. at 1, 7, and 14 DIM, respectively. At the same times, another 37 cows received Lachesis comp., whereas 33 cows treated with saline served as controls. First heat was observed earlier in both treatment groups. Cows that received Traumeel ad us. vet., Lachesis comp., and Carduus comp. were more likely to be cyclic at an undefined point in time compared with control cows. treated 214 cows with 4% metacresol sulfonic acid formaldehyde polycondensate intrauterinely and 174 cows with the same solution and administered Mucosa comp. intramuscularly, a mixed formula of homeopathic remedies. Cows that received Mucosa comp. had a significantly shorter interval to pregnancy, a lower insemination index (parameter not defined in this article), and a higher first-service pregnancy rate. In a randomized, double-blinded study by [Fidelak et al., 2007](#bib18) - - Klocke P. - Heuwieser W. Homoeopathic prophylaxis in dairy cows on an organic farm. Part 1\u2014Fertility. , 76 organic dairy cows were treated with Carduus comp. and Coenzyme comp. at the day of drying off, Traumeel on the day of calving, and Lachesis comp. at 14 DIM. Control cows received saline according to the same protocol. Cows in the treatment group showed an earlier onset of cyclic activity but a lower submission rate. Regarding subgroups, the authors concluded that only cows with a higher milk yield showed a positive effect from the treatment. (Average milk yield in this study was 5,100 kg/cow per lactation.) No other significant differences were found. The objective of this double-blinded, randomized, and controlled study was to evaluate 2 different homeopathic treatment protocols for the prevention of clinical endometritis in dairy cows. The homeopathic remedies were selected and the treatment protocol was designed by an expert panel of practitioners certified in the field of alternative medicine, advisors experienced in designing and conducting studies on homeopathy in cattle, the manufacturer, and the authors. The basis for the treatment protocols was published specifications on the effect of the remedies ( ), the results of the above-cited studies, and the experience of experts. The drugs used in this study were Lachesis compositum N ad us. vet. (Lachesis), Carduus compositum ad us. vet. (Carduus), and Traumeel LT ad us. vet. (Traumeel; all from Heel, Baden-Baden, Germany). The drugs contained a mixed formula of homeopathic remedies. The abbreviation \"D\" behind the remedies represents a decimal dilution ratio of 1:10. The digit describes the frequency of According to many authors, Lachesis can be used for several conditions of inflammation ( [Dorenkamp, 1991](#bib5) Lachesis et al., 1994](#bib2) - Boitor I. - Bogdan M.L. - Ghitulescu C. - Bogdan I. Einsatz der Homoeopathika us. vet. bei Carduus enhances the can be used against traumatic insults. During parturition, the physical barriers of the cervix, vagina, and vulva are compromised, providing the opportunity for bacteria to ascend the genital tract and cause endometritis and subfertility ( ). In addition, relationships between nutrition and reproductive performance have been well documented ( [Butler et al., 2006](#bib4) - Butler S.T. - Pelton S.H. - Butler W.R. Energy balance, metabolic status, and the first postpartum ovarian follicle wave in cows administered propylene glycol. ; [Lucy, 2001](#bib29) ADSA Foundation Scholar Award: Reproductive high-producing dairy cattle: Where will it end?. ). The first strategy contained Traumeel, Lachesis, and Carduus. Traumeel was selected for immediate administration after parturition to palliate complications after trauma caused ). Results of the few published studies indicate a possible positive effect in treatment of acute injuries and trauma ( et al., 2008](#bib37) - Schneider C. - Schneider B. - Hanisch J. - van Haselen R. The role of a homoeopathic preparation compared with conventional therapy in the treatment of injuries: An observational cohort study. ) and modulation of the immune response ( [Porozov et al., 2004](#bib32) - Porozov S. - - Weiser M. Bransk - Inhibition of and TNF- secretion from resting and activated human immunocytes by the homeopathic medication Traumeel S. ). According to and [Boitor et al., 1994](#bib2) - Boitor I. - Bogdan M.L. - Ghitulescu C. - Bogdan I. Einsatz der Homoeopathika us. vet. bei Rind. , Lachesis stimulates the local that Carduus was able to prevent nutritional hepatic disorders. Thus, Carduus may help to moderate the effects of the negative energy balance in the first trimester of lactation. The second strategy focused on a possible antiinflammatory effect of the homeopathic remedies. Hence, cows received 3 administrations of Lachesis in the first 3 wk after calving. In addition, Carduus was administered to moderate the metabolic condition. Materials and Methods The study was conducted on a commercial dairy farm in Brandenburg, Germany, from November 2004 to February 2006 with 330 heifers and 720 cows in 2 separate barns. All heifers and cows were kept in groups of 50 to 100 animals in free-stall barns with slotted concrete floors. Herd average milk yield was 8,500 in 2004 and 9,000 kg in 2006. Cows were fed a mixed ration with additional concentrates from automatic feeders according to their current milk yield. Lactating cows were milked 3 times daily. The voluntary waiting period was 42 d. All cows were artificially inseminated on observed estrus. No timed breeding protocols (e.g., Ovsynch) were used. At the beginning of the study, median days to first service was 69 DIM (interquartile range 57.0 to 91.5) and median days open was 104 d (interquartile range 73.7 to 139.0). The owner of the farm, participating farm workers, and veterinarians were informed about relevant characteristics of the study and agreed with the study design (informed consent). Within the first 24 h after parturition, all primiparous and multiparous cows were enrolled in the study. Exclusion criteria were systemic antibiotic or hormonal treatments between 0 and 27 DIM, severe injuries at parturition [i.e., pelvic fractures, perineal lacerations, and vaginal phlegmons (palpable swellings of the vagina)], or caesarean section. Cows that received intrauterine antibiotics for the treatment of metritis or that were treated for hypocalcemia or displaced abomasum and animals with palpable adhesions of the uterus were also excluded from the study. Cows in group TLC2 received 10 mL of Traumeel (i.m.) as the first treatment on the day of calving. After 7 to 13 DIM, these animals were treated with 10 mL of Lachesis (i.m.), and after another 7 and 14 d, respectively, 10 mL of Carduus was administered (i.m.). Cows in group L3C received 10 mL of Lachesis (i.m.) at the first 3 treatments and 10 mL of Carduus (i.m.) at 21 to 27 DIM. Animals in the control group received 4 treatments of 10 mL of 0.9% saline on the day of calving and at 7 to 13, 14 to 20, and 21 to 27 DIM. The study was conducted as a double-blinded trial. The remedies were produced as single-dose vials and were labeled A1 to A4, B1 to B4, and C1 to C4 at the manufacturing site of the company. Neither the persons who conducted the treatments, examinations, and statistical analyses nor the members of the farm staff were aware of the association between these characters and the remedies or the placebo, respectively. Cows were assigned to 1 of 3 groups according to the last digit of the ear tag number. Cows with a last digit of 1, 2, or 3 were enrolled in group A, cows with a last digit of 4, 5, or 6 were enrolled in group B, and cows with a last digit of 7, 8, or 9 were allocated to group C. Cows with a last digit of 0 were enrolled according to the second to last digit. All ear tag numbers had been assigned to calves after birth by the national cow identification system (VIT) at least 2 yr before the trial. The unblinding was conducted after the final statistical analyses had been completed. It revealed that cows in group A had received treatment TLC2 and that cows in group B had received treatment strategy L3C. Cows in group C served as controls and had received saline. Farm workers had been trained by veterinarians from the Clinic for Animal Reproduction (Berlin, Germany) for administration of the first treatment within 24 h postpartum with solution A1, B1, or C1, respectively. These treatments, information about the date and time of calving, and obstetric interventions were recorded on a case report form. At monthly intervals and again at the end of the study, the case report forms were checked for compliance. Cows with incorrect treatments or incomplete examination records were retrospectively withdrawn from the study. On the scheduled weekly visits, cows received the second treatment (A2, B2, or C2) at 7 to 13 DIM, the third treatment (A3, B3, or C3) at 14 to 20 DIM, and the fourth treatment (A4, B4, or C4) at 21 to 27 DIM, administered by a veterinarian from the Clinic for Animal Reproduction. All cows were examined by external inspection and by palpation of the genital tract per rectum immediately before the last treatment at 21 to 27 DIM (exam 1). All clinical findings were documented on the case report form [i.e., the size and contents of both uterine horns, vulvar discharge, the size of the ovaries, and the presence of follicles or corpora lutea (CL )]. Vaginal discharge or fluctuating contents in the uterus were regarded as signs of clinical endometritis. In addition, all cows were examined by transrectal ultrasonography (Easy Scan, BCF Technology Ltd., Livingston, Scotland; 4.5- to 8.5-MHz linear array transducer) to measure the maximum diameter of the uterine lumen and to detect abnormal contents. Cows with no clinical signs of endometritis but a diameter of the uterine lumen of 0.5 cm or visible echogenic contents were also classified as having endometritis ( [Lincke et al., 2007](#bib28) - M. - Heuwieser W. Subclinical endometritis in dairy cattle and its effect on reproductive performance\u2014A review on recent publications. ). Endometritis was classified into 3 categories: a clear vaginal discharge with flakes of pus, a diameter of the uterine lumen 0.5 cm or visible echogenic contents (E1); a mucopurulent discharge or fluctuating contents in the uterus (E2); or a purulent discharge with or without palpable contents in the uterus and palpable fluctuating contents without vaginal discharge (E3). The diameter of antral follicles and of the CL was assessed by transrectal B-mode ultrasonography of the ovaries. Cows with follicles or CL with a diameter of 0.5 cm were regarded as showing cyclic activity ( [Ginther et al., 1989](#bib20) - Ginther O.J. - Knopf L. - Kastelic J.P. Temporal associations among ovarian events in cattle during oestrus cycles with two and three follicular waves. ; [Savio et al., 1990](#bib35) - Savio Boland Hynes N. - Roche J.F. Resumption of follicular activity in the early post-partum period of dairy cows. ). Cows with signs of endometritis or acyclicity at exam 1 were reexamined 1 wk later (28 to 35 DIM, exam 2). Endometritic or acyclic cows at exam 2 were submitted to a third examination (35 to 41 DIM, exam 3). Cows with endometritis at exam 3 were treated intramuscularly with 0.15 mg of R-cloprostenol (Preloban, Intervet Deutschland GmbH, Unterschlei\u00dfheim, Germany) and reexamined 2 wk later. In the case of ongoing endometritis, cows were re-treated with 0.15 mg of R-cloprostenol. This schedule was continued until the cow showed no more signs of endometritis. Other diseases were treated at the discretion of the local veterinarian. All diagnoses and treatments were recorded. If the exclusion criteria were met, cows were withdrawn from the study retrospectively. To validate the resumption of ovarian activity and the metabolic condition, blood samples from all cows were taken from the coccygeal vein or artery. Blood was collected with an 18-gauge needle into Venosave plain silicone-coated tubes (Terumo Europe N.V., Leuven, Belgium). The blood samples were stored in a mobile refrigerating box (Dometic Waeco International GmbH, Emsdetten, Germany) at 3\u00b0C for 2 to 4 h. Samples were centrifuged at 2,500 \u00d7 g and serum was transferred into 2-mL serum tubes (2 aliquots). Tubes were labeled and stored at 25\u00b0C. One hundred samples taken from each group at exam 1 and 100 samples taken from the same animals at exam 2 were selected by using a random selection plan generated with Excel (Version 2003; Microsoft, Redmond, WA) and submitted for further analysis. All samples were assayed in duplicate by a commercial laboratory. Progesterone (P4 ) was measured by an RIA (Access Immunoassay Systems, Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). The presence of a functional CL was defined as a P4 level of >1 ng/mL ( [Staples et al., Staples C.R. - Thatcher W.W. - Clark J.H. Relationship between ovarian activity and energy status during the early postpartum period of high producing dairy cows. ; [Janowski et al., 1998](#bib24) - Janowski T. - Zdunczyk 2002](#bib30) - Mateus L. - Lopes da Costa L. - Bernardo F. - Robalo Silva J. Influence of puerperal uterine infection on uterine involution and postpartum ovarian activity in dairy cows. ). The concentration of BHBA in blood serum (Wako Values >1.0 mmol/L indicated the presence of subclinical Wako Pure Chemical Industries) was used for the quantitative determination of NEFA in serum. Concentrations of 0.7 mmol/L indicated metabolic disorders ( [Duffield, 2004](#bib9) Duffield, T. F. 2004. Monitoring strategies for metabolic disease in transition dairy cows. 23rd World Buiatrics Congr., Quebec City, Canada. Ordre des m\u00e9decins veterinaries du Qu\u00e9bec, Canada. ). Reproductive performance was characterized by days to first AI, first AI conception rate (number of cows pregnant after the first AI divided by the number of cows inseminated \u00d7 100), services per conception, days to pregnancy, cumulative pregnancy rate (number of cows documented to be pregnant at 200 DIM divided by the number of cows enrolled \u00d7 100), days to culling, and the proportion of cows culled. Cows not pregnant by 200 DIM were classified as not pregnant, even if they remained in the herd and conceived later in lactation. Statistical Analyses Data were analyzed with SPSS for Windows (Versions 15.0 and 16.0, SPSS Inc., Munich, Germany). The proportion of cows with endometritis and ultrasonographic findings in the 3 groups were compared by chi-square analysis. For the logistic regression as well as for the survival analyses (Cox regression), the confidence interval was set at 95%. The logistic regression model for the risk of endometritis included treatment (0 = control; 1 = TLC2; 2 = L3C), dystocia (0 = no dystocia; 1 = dystocia), and parity class (0 = multiparous; 1 = primiparous). For the logistic regression model for the risk of conception after first AI as well as for the survival analyses for the hazards of insemination and pregnancy within 200 DIM, treatment, dystocia, and parity were included as covariates. Adjusted odds ratios, hazard ratios, confidence intervals, and P-values are reported. Survival analyses for the hazards of insemination and pregnancy within 200 DIM, respectively, were performed by censoring cows not inseminated and not pregnant, respectively. For all statistical analyses, the level of significance was set at = 0.05. Results A total of 929 primiparous and multiparous dairy cows were initially enrolled in the study and received the first treatments ( [Table 1](#tbl1) ). After removing cows that met the exclusion criteria, a total of 617 cows were eligible for final evaluation. Reasons for exclusion showed no significant differences between groups ( [Table 1](#tbl1) ). Table 1Number of animals enrolled in 2 homeopathic treatment groups and a control group, number of animals eligible at 21 and 27 DIM (exam 1), excluded animals, and reasons for exclusion within 21 DIM An assisted calving was recorded for 26.2, 24.1, and 24.5% in the TLC2, L3C, and control groups, respectively. The overall prevalence of endometritis was 43.4% (43.1 and 44.3% in cows and heifers, respectively) at exam 1 (P > 0.05; [Table 2](#tbl2) ). No significant differences were found between groups. Table 2Prevalence of endometritis from 21 to 27 DIM in 2 homeopathic treatment groups and a control group Ultrasonographic examination of both ovaries at exam 1 showed that 85.1% of the animals had follicles with a diameter of >5 mm or at least 1 CL with a diameter of >5 mm ( [Table 3](#tbl3) ). Neither a functional follicle nor a CL was found in 8.8% of the cows. Ovarian cysts with a diameter of 25 mm were found in 4.7% of the animals. No significant differences were found between treatment groups. Table 3Findings of the ovaries from 21 to 27 DIM in 2 homeopathic treatment groups and a control group From 100 cows of each group, blood samples were taken for the determination of P4, BHBA, and NEFA at exams 1 and 2. Because of the exclusion of some cows, 97 samples from the TLC2 group, 94 samples from the L3C group, and 100 samples from the control group were analyzed. The proportions of animals with a P4 level of >1 ng/mL at exam 1 were 41.2, 38.3, and 46.0% in the TLC2, L3C, and control group, respectively. The medians (and interquartile ranges) of P4 at exam 1 were 1.84 (0.00 to 5.21), 0.91 (0.00 to 6.33), to 6.05) ng/mL for the TLC2, L3C, and control group, respectively. The proportions of animals with a BHBA level <1.0 mmol/L were 82.5, 77.7, and control group, respectively. Medians (and interquartile ranges) of BHBA at exam 0.87), to 0.63) the TLC2, L3C, and control group, respectively. Nonesterified fatty acid values of <0.7 mmol/L were found in 40.2, 42.5, and 41.0% of cows in the TLC2, L3C, and control group, respectively. Medians (and interquartile ranges) of NEFA at exam 1 were 0.63 (0.37 to 0.88), 0.78 (0.44 to 1.16), and 0.75 (0.34 to 1.12) mmol/L for the TLC2, L3C, and control group, respectively. Differences between the groups were not significant for any of the tested parameters. Descriptive reproductive performance data are given in [Table 4](#tbl4) . Logistic regression revealed that cows with dystocia and assisted calvings had a significantly higher risk (OR = 1.88, P < 0.05) for endometritis at exam 1 ( [Table 5](#tbl5) ). The risk for endometritis at exam 1 was not affected by treatment or parity. Results of the logistic regression analyses for the risk of conception after first AI showed a statistically significant effect (OR = 0.67, P = 0.04), with primiparous cows being at a lower risk for pregnancy than multiparous cows ( [Table 5](#tbl5) ). Treatment and dystocia did not affect the risk of conception after first AI. The Cox regression revealed no effect of treatment or other tested covariates on time to first service or to pregnancy ( [Table 6](#tbl6) ). Table 4Descriptive reproductive performance data in 2 homeopathic treatment groups and a control group Table 5Results of logistic regression analyses for the risk of endometritis from 21 to 27 DIM and the risk of conception after first AI in 2 homeopathic treatment groups and a control group Table 6Results of the Cox regression of days to first service and days to conception in 2 homeopathic treatment groups and a control group Discussion The demand for alternative therapies has been increasing in the last several years ( ). Many authors recommend homotoxicological remedies for the treatment of livestock because they can be used by persons with less experience in homeopathy ( contain mixed formulas of drugs in homeopathic (minute) doses and are presumed to be effective against specific conditions or ailments. These might help veterinarians meet the European organic regulations. In contrast to classic homeopathy according to , we did not use an individualized therapy. For individualized therapy, the symptoms of each animal are observed and the remedy that most closely matches the symptoms of the patient is chosen for the treatment. The aim of the study was to use a treatment and examination protocol that could be easily integrated into routine work with weekly farm visits following the established concepts for herd health ( [Bonnett et al., 1993](#bib3) - Bonnett B.N. - Wayne Martin S. - Meek A.H. Associations of clinical findings, bacteriological and histological results of endometrial biopsy with reproductive performance of postpartum dairy cows. ; [LeBlanc et al., 2002b](#bib27) - LeBlanc S.J. - Duffield T.F. - Leslie K.E. - Bateman K.G. - Keefe G.P. - Walton J.S. - Johnson W.H. The effect of treatment of clinical endometritis on reproductive performance in dairy cows. ; [Kasimanickam et al., 2004](#bib25) - Kasimanickam R. - Duffield T.F. - Foster R.A. - Gartley C.J. - Leslie K.E. Walton J.S. - Johnson W.H. Endometrial cytology for of subclinical in postpartum dairy cows. ). The prevalence of endometritis was 43.4% at the time of exam 1. This prevalence is similar to ( [Falkenberg and Heuwieser, 2005](#bib17) - Falkenberg U. - Heuwieser W. Influence of time of initiation of a prostaglandin F2 protocol in dairy cows with puerperal endometritis. ) or higher than ( [Drillich et - Drillich M. - Beetz - Pf\u00fctzner A. - Sabin M. - Sabin H.J. - Kutzer P. - Nattermann H. - Heuwieser W. Evaluation of a systemic antibiotic treatment of toxic puerperal metritis in dairy cows. ) the results of other studies performed in large German dairy herds. This can be explained by the more sensitive diagnosis by ultrasound ( [Fissore et al., The use of ultrasonography for the study of the bovine reproductive tract: II Non-pregnant, pregnant and pathological conditions of the uterus. ; [Kasimanickam et al., 2004](#bib25) - Kasimanickam R. - Duffield T.F. - Foster R.A. - Gartley C.J. - Leslie K.E. Walton J.S. - Johnson W.H. Endometrial cytology for the of subclinical in postpartum dairy cows. ; [Sheldon et al., 2006a](#bib39) - Sheldon I.M. - Lewis G.S. - LeBlanc S. - Gilbert R.O. Defining postpartum uterine disease in cattle. ). With regard to the prevalence or severity of endometritis, differences were not significant between groups. Thus, the treatment protocols tested were not effective in preventing bovine endometritis in our study. Unfortunately, no science-based information is available in the literature with which to compare our findings. The proportion of cows without functional follicles or CL was 8.9% at exam 1 ( [Table 3](#tbl3) ). The homeopathic treatments did not have any significant effects on the proportion of noncycling cows between groups. However, the percentage of noncycling cows in all groups was lower than reported in several other studies ( [Opsomer et al., 2000](#bib31) - Opsomer G. - - Hertl J. - Coryn M. - Deluyker H. - de Kruif A. Risk factors for post partum ovarian dysfunction in high producing dairy cows in Belgium: A field study. reduction of noncycling animals in a randomized, controlled, and blinded trial with 105 animals when using homeopathic remedies compared with a control group. These results could not be confirmed by our study. To our knowledge, no other evidence-based information is available for comparison. The evaluation of P4 concentrations at exam 1 did not show significant differences between the treatment groups and the control group. [Enbergs and the concentration of P4 in the milk fat and reported lower days to first estrus for both homeopathic treatment groups (54.8 and 59.1 d) compared with control cows (65.4 d). When the proportions of cows with a BHBA value of >1.0 mmol/L were compared, indicating subclinical or clinical ketosis, no statistically significant differences were found between groups. Thus, we could not confirm that BHBA concentrations were lower in treated animals, as reported earlier ( [Schlecht et al., 2005](#bib36) - Schlecht S. - Martin Riedl von Milchk\u00fchen. . Furthermore, none of the reproductive performance parameters showed a significant difference between groups. Mean days to first AI varied from 72.0 to 74.0 and pregnancy rate ranged from 79.9 to 84.6%. In the present study, it took 99 to 101 d to pregnancy, indicating an average herd reproductive performance typical for a German dairy herd. [Enbergs and fewer days to pregnancy in animals treated with homeopathic remedies compared with control animals. In earlier studies, treated animals had significantly fewer days to pregnancy ( ) and fewer services per conception ( [Boitor et al., 1994](#bib2) - Boitor I. - Bogdan M.L. - Ghitulescu C. - Bogdan I. Einsatz der Homoeopathika us. vet. bei ad us. vet. bei Ovarialzysten beim Rind. ). These findings were not confirmed by our study. The first AI conception rate in our study ranged from 39.6 (L3C group) to 42.8% (control group). These values are comparable with data from similar studies of large German dairy herds ( [Tenhagen and Heuwieser, 1999](#bib43) - Tenhagen B.A. - Heuwieser W. Comparison of a conventional reproductive management programme based on rectal palpation and uterine treatment of endometritis with a strategic prostaglandin F2 alpha programme. ; [Drillich et al., 2002](#bib7) - Drillich M. - Bergmann J. - Falkenberg U. - Kurth A. - Heuwieser W. Effects of the intensity of a post partum examination on the fertility performance of high yielding dairy cows. ). We could confirm that cows with dystocia and subsequent calving assistance had a significantly higher risk for endometritis at exam 1. It also remains unclear why primiparous cows had a lower risk of pregnancy than multiparous cows. This is in contrast to the results from other studies ( [Drillich et al., 2002](#bib7) - Drillich M. - Bergmann J. - Falkenberg U. - Kurth A. - Heuwieser W. Effects of the intensity of a post partum examination on the fertility performance of high yielding dairy cows. [LeBlanc et al., 2002b](#bib27) - LeBlanc S.J. - Duffield T.F. - Leslie K.E. - Bateman K.G. - Keefe G.P. - Walton J.S. - Johnson W.H. The effect of treatment of clinical endometritis on reproductive performance in dairy cows. ). In conclusion, the homeopathic treatment protocols evaluated were not effective in preventing bovine endometritis, improving the metabolic condition, or improving reproductive performance. Because of a negative tendency of some data concerning the treatment groups, a detrimental effect of the homeopathic strategies should be examined in further studies. This study is the only randomized, controlled, and double-blinded clinical trial to be conducted with a sufficient number of animals in the field of homeopathy in cattle. We could not confirm the results of other studies indicating a positive effect of the chosen homeopathic treatment protocols. "}
