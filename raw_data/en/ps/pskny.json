The pain, grief and lost to many people. The loneliness and the want for closure is very real. Having recently been contacted by a friend of mine for help to try and bring closure and inner peace to her staff who are just gone through a horrendous year having lost so many of the residents to the coronavirus in her nursing home. it inspired me to write a beautiful ceremony for them which included the planting of daffodils the reading of poetry and candles to knowledge each person who had passed away and also acknowledging each member of staff regardless to whether they were a doctor, nurse receptionist, attendant kitchen staff each and every person was hurting and needed to heal.. it got me thinking how as a minister I could extend this healing to the wider community, how many other people were hurting out there perhaps you have had to have a funeral ceremony of a loved one and it was very limited to the amount who could attend. As a minister I can help bring closure to you by creating a little ceremony perhaps on a special anniversary or perhaps the scattering of ashes in their favourite place we can work together to bring healing into your life. I extend the hand of friendship to you from my heart to yours and look forward to us connecting. "}
