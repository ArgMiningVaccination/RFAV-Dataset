The main goal of Chiropractors is to provide a drug-free, conservative treatment of dysfunctions in the spine that leads to nerve interference and pain. Chiropractic care is a system of therapy focused on the body's structure, mainly the spine. Chiropractors use manipulative therapy to relieve pain and improve the body function. By using their hands or using another device, they will manipulate your body's alignment. Depending on your condition, we will design a plan of treatment for your unique needs and wants.

Yes, we have the latest equipment for cold light laser therapy - Theralase\u00ae therapeutic lasers. This therapy uses specific wavelengths of light, stimulating tissue healing, and providing pain management. How do therapeutic lasers work? Theralase\u00ae therapeutic medical lasers supply energy to the body by injecting billions of photons of light deep into tissue structures. Our body's tissue contains protein strands that absorb the light energy and transform it into three types of chemical energy for the cell. This chemical energy causes a decrease in inflammation and pain and accelerates the healing process. Cold light laser therapy allows successful treatment of chronic conditions and acute musculoskeletal injuries. The Theralase's 2000 dual wavelength super pulsing technology is the only laser that penetrates up to 5 inches into the tissue to increase healing and decrease pain and swelling at the deepest sites. What conditions can be treated with Theralase\u00ae? Besides the abovementioned conditions, Theralase\u00ae can treat over 100 conditions, including addiction rehabilitation, sports injuries, wound healing, anti-aging, dermatological conditions, weight loss, among many others. Finally, it is at the practitioner to determine based on the clinical evidence which conditions can be treated with these therapy systems. Is this therapy safe? The technology is safe, highly effective, painless, and has no adverse side effects. It uses the body's own natural healing system to ease the pain, to raise joint mobility, improve tissue integrity, and advance cell regeneration. How long does the Theralase\u00ae therapy last? Treatment time will vary from 2 minutes to 20 minutes. The number of treatments varies between 5 and 25, depending on the severity of the condition and the body's natural healing rate. What are the benefits of cold laser therapy? There are many benefits of Theralase\u00ae: - No Medication Involved - Personalized Treatments - Non-toxic - Non-invasive - Stimulated Nerve Function - Increased Vascular Activity - Increased Metabolic Activity - Stimulated Nerve Function - Anti-Inflammatory Action - Tissue Repair - Rapid Cell Growth - Easily applied - Highly effective Give us a call to see how Active Family Chiropractic Care Center can improve your comfort and quality "}
