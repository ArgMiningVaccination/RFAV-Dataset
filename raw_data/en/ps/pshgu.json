[Explore CCRP2-sponsored projects](/covid19-research-overview#ccrp2-sponsored-projects-28) BSL-3 Research Guidelines All COVID-19 research projects using biohazardous materials must be fully approved by the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) prior to performing any experiments. Please visit the [Rutgers Biosafety Program](https://ipo.rutgers.edu/rehs/biosafety-program) for the most up-to-date biosafety information on COVID-19-related research at Rutgers or contact [biosafety@rutgers.edu](mailto:biosafety@rutgers.edu). CCRP2 has also established a BSL-3 Advisory Committee that will review new COVID-19 study proposals that require resources at the International Center for Public Health (ICPH) building, including BSL-3, ABSL-3, or BSL-2 enhanced. This committee is chaired by Padmini Salgame and includes representatives from several Rutgers research organizations: - Guillaume Delmas (Rutgers Environmental Health and Safety) - Jeetendra Eswaraka (Comparative Medicine Resources) - Anthony Gresko (Rutgers Environmental Health and Safety) - Pradeep Kumar (Center for Emerging Pathogens) - Sumanth Kumar Putta (Comparative Medicine Resources) - Deborah Lazzarino (NJMS Assistant Dean for Research) - Riccardo Russo (Rutgers Regional Biocontainment Laboratory) - Selvakumar Subbian (Public Health Research Institute) This committee will provide recommendations to David Alland, Director of the Center for COVID-19 Response and Pandemic Preparedness, to promote resource planning and programmatic decisions for the BSL-3 facilities in the ICPH building. To facilitate and expedite COVID-19 research, standard operating procedures for in vitro and in vivo work with SARS-CoV-2 virus, virus inactivation procedures, activity-specific biosafety guidelines, and risk assessments for work with SARS-CoV-2 are being established. If you are interested in performing COVID-19 research in BSL-3/ABSL-3 facilities at ICPH, please review the [BSL-3 COVID-19 Project Approval Workflow](/sites/default/files/2021-01/BSL3 Project Approval Workflow.pdf) and complete the following steps: - Submit a biosafety protocol in [MyREHS](http://myrehs.rutgers.edu). An approved IBC protocol is required prior to conducting any COVID-19-related research. Note: IBC approval does not constitute permission to access or begin work in a BSL3 facility. - Submit the [COVID-19 Studies in ABSL-3, BSL-3, or BSL-2 Enhanced Labs form](https://research.njms.rutgers.edu/redcap/surveys/?s=AFW4EF88JF). REHS will liaise with the BSL-3 Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Committee to confirm that SOPs being referred to are appropriate for the proposed activities, including inactivation. Note: BSL-3 SOPs are separate from both the IBC protocol and the IBC review process. The IBC does not oversee the development or review of BSL-3 SOPs. Please contact [David Alland](mailto:allandda@rutgers.edu) if a letter of support describing CCRP2-supported BSL-3 research activities is required for external funding applications.

Please email any questions to [proposed.covid19.studies.icph@njms.rutgers.edu](mailto:proposed.covid19.studies.icph@njms.rutgers.edu) Clinical Trials Rutgers University was selected as the only [COVID-19 Prevention Network (CoVPN)](https://www.coronaviruspreventionnetwork.org/) site in New Jersey as part of NIH's Operation Warp Speed and is involved in vaccine, therapeutics, and diagnostic trials. Clinical studies at Rutgers have focused on several important challenges relevant to the COVID-19 pandemic: - Understanding the transmission efficacy of COVID-19 to front-line healthcare workers - Testing some of the most promising treatments for moderate and severe COVID-related illnesses - Evaluating COVID-19 vaccines in diverse New Jersey communities As the pandemic continues, Rutgers faculty are leading several new avenues of clinical exploration, including the development of low-cost point-of-care testing that can be used in low- and middle-income countries, as well as targeted therapeutics for the sickest of COVID-19 patients. Featured Studies Rutgers investigator-initiated, in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, ATTAC-19 explores the efficacy of a combination medicine of aspirin and dipyridamole - typically used to reduce stroke risk - to treat patients with SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 symptoms (led by Amit Singla). In the US, Rutgers recruited and enrolled the largest number of participants, 850+, and was the second highest enrollment site globally in this critical COVID-19 single-dose vaccine study (led by Jeffrey Carson). This pilot study's aim is to determine whether early intervention with EDP1815, a monoclonal microbe, can prevent progression of COVID-19 symptoms and the development of complications associated with hyperinflammation and cytokine storm (led by Reynold Panettieri, with Sunil Patel). COVID-19 Initiatives Rutgers investigators are active in supporting a range of COVID-19 initiatives, testing approaches, behavioral interventions and treatment studies at RBHS sites. Here is a sample of that range of research: - As an NIH-National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) collaborator, RBHS serves as a trial site for the NCATS ACTIV studies. Among them is the ACTIV-1 IM master protocol, designed to evaluate multiple investigational agents (Infliximab, Abatacept, Cenicriviroc) for the treatment of moderately or severely ill patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (R. Panettieri). Another such treatment study is ACTIV-4, which focuses on the increased risk of thrombotic complications posed by COVID-19, and investigates preventing clotting events in hospitalized patients. ACTIV-4 will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of varying doses of the blood thinner heparin (Y. Greenstein). - Rutgers NJ HEROS TOO evaluates two outreach approaches to certain over-looked healthcare workers (healthcare worker focused versus community organization led). Using the novel Rutgers-developed saliva test - the first FDA authorized diagnostic using saliva to detect SARS-CoV-2 for non-invasive, home-based testing - this behavioral intervention study explores individual, family and community factors affecting COVID-19 testing implementation. (S. Hudson). - RBHS continues to participate in trials of FDA emergency-use approved vaccines now offering protection against COVID-19. In addition to supporting J&J's ENSEMBLE study until its 2022 completion, Rutgers-New Jersey Medical School serves as a site for the ongoing two-year Phase 3 Moderna trial of the successful vaccine candidate mRNA-1273 (S. Swaminathan). More information about these and other Rutgers investigator-supported COVID-19 studies can be found at [clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/).
