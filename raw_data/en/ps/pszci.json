The NDDoH Immunization Program supplies free vaccines for children who are eligible for the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program. The program also investigates cases of vaccine -preventable diseases, provides education about immunizations and vaccine -preve ntable diseases, monitors the state's immunization rates, implements evidence -based activities to increase immunization ra tes, and maintains and updates the North Dakota Immunization Information System (NDIIS). 2018 Epidemiology Repor t 6 Vaccine -Preventable Disease Surveill ance Jenny Galbraith , Surveillance Epidemiologist Measles In 2018, the United States saw 372 cases of measles. There were sevent een outbreaks across the United States. Three of these outbreaks, associated primarily with unvaccinated people in Orthodox Jewish communities, contributed to most of the cases. These ou tbreaks serve as an important reminder on how quickly disease can spre ad when immunization rates fall in a community. The last reported case of measles in North Dakota occurred in 2011. Measles is an extremely contagious respiratory disease caused by a v irus. Measles usually begins with a fever. Individuals develop a cough , runny nose, and red watery eyes soon after. Three to four days after symptom onset, a rash of tiny red spots breaks out on the head, and eventually covers the entire body. Serious heal th complications can occur as a result of measles, including encephali tis, pneumonia, and death. The measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine protects against the measles virus. MMR vaccine is routinely recommended at ages 12 -15 months and 4 -6 years. Ad ditionally, adults born in or after 1957 are recommended to have at le ast one documented dose of MMR vaccine or laboratory evidence of immunity. Adults who are considered high risk should have two documented doses of MMR vaccine or laboratory evidence of i mmunity. Health care workers, college students, and international trav elers are considered high risk. Mumps Mumps is a vaccine -preventable disease caused by the mumps virus. Common symptoms of mumps include fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, and lo ss of appetite. The most recognizable symptom of mumps is the puffy ch eeks and swollen jaw caused by swollen salivary glands. Mumps cases range in the United States from year to year from hundreds to thousands. In 2018, there were 2,251 cases of mumps reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Prior to the introduction of the vaccine, there were about 186,000 cases reported in the United States every year. Since the vaccine, the annual number of reported mumps cases has decr eased by more than 99 %. In North Dakota, there were 0 confirmed or probable ca ses of mumps reported in 2018. Mumps cases across the country have increased in recent years. The MMR vaccine protects against the mumps virus. MMR vaccine is routinely recomm ended at ages 12 -15 months and 4 -6 years. Additionally, adults born in or afte r 1957 are recommended to have at least one documented dose of MMR vaccine or laboratory evidence of immunity. Adults who are considered high risk should have two documented dose s of MMR vaccine or laboratory evidence of immunity. Health care workers, coll ege students, and international travelers are considered high risk. 2018 Epidemiology Repor t 7 Figure 1: Mumps Cases in North Dakota, 200 6-2018 Meningococcal Meningitis Over 300 cases of meningococcal disease were reported to the CDC in the United States in 2018. Additionall y, outbreaks involving Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B continue to be reported on college campuses. North Dakota did not have any reports of mening ococcal disease in 2018. Meningococcal disease is an invasive infection of the bacteria N. meningitidis . A common outcome of infection is meningitis. Symptoms accompanying meningitis include nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and altered mental status. Invasi ve meningococcal infection can also result in a blood stream infection, known as bacteremia. Symptoms of b acteremia include fatigue, vomiting, cold hands and feet, cold chills, severe aches or pain in the muscles, joints, chest or abdomen, rapid breathing, diarrhea, and a dark purplish rash. The meningococcal conjugate vaccine protects against strains A, C, W , and Y. All 11 to 12 -year-olds should receive a dose of meningococcal conjugate vaccine, followed by a booster at age 16 years. In addition, the serogroup B meningococcal vaccine is available for 16 through 23 -year-olds. 14 3 2 0 04 01 1 010 10 0 0246810121416 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018Case Count Year 2018 Epidemiology Repor t 8 Pertussis Pertussis or whoop ing cough is a respiratory disease caused by the bacteria Bordetella pertussis . The illness usually begins with cold -like symptoms and progresses to a cough, gradually becoming m ore severe. Pertussis is known for uncontrollable, violent coughing which ofte n makes it hard to breath. The characteristic whooping sound is made when an individual has a severe coughing attack and needs to take a deep breath. Pertussis can be especially severe in unvaccinated infants and can results in pneumonia and even death. Transmission of pertussis occurs via large respiratory droplets; pertussis is highly contagious during the first three weeks of coughing. Antibiotic treatment can limit transmission; after five days of appropriate antibiotic treatment an individual is no longer contagious. Two vaccines are routinely recommended to protect against pertussis. DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis) vaccine is routinely recommended for infants age 2, 4, 6, and 15 -18 months, with an additional dose given at age 4 -6 years. Tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (Tdap) vaccine is routinely recommended for adolescents age 11 -12. Adults who have never received a dose of Tdap are recommended to do so. Additionally, pregnant women are recommended to receive a dose of Tdap d uring each pregnancy between 27 and 36 weeks gestation, ideally between 27 to 32 weeks. Tdap given during pregnancy not only protects the mother, but protective antibodies are passed to the fetus to protect the infant during the first few months of life. In 2018 North Dakota reported 51 cases of pertussis. Outbreaks of pertussis typically occur every three to four years. North Dakota's last peak year was in 2012, with 214 cases.

Symptoms typically include a blister -like rash, itching, tiredness, and fever. Chickenpox is a very contagious disease. The virus is spread from person to person by tou ching or breathin g in virus particles from the blisters, or through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. An infected person is contagious from 1 -2 days before the onset of the rash until all lesions have crusted. In 2018, 48 cases of chicken pox were reported to the NDDoH. The NDDoH recommends confirming chickenpox cases through PCR testing. Vaccination has made the classical presentation of chickenpox less common, and the disease more difficult to diagnose. Breakthrough rash may look similar to other diseases , such as hand, foot, and mo uth disease. In addition, all chickenpox cases should be reported to the NDDoH regardless of testing. The varicella vaccine protects against chickenpox. The vaccine is routinely recommended at ages 12 -15 month s and 4 -6 years. Two doses of varicella vaccine are required for kindergarten entry in North Dakota.

Symptoms of hepatitis A may include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, abdominal discomfort, dark urine, pale stools, and jaundice. Hepatitis A infection does not result in a chronic disease and symptoms typically last less than two months. A pers on with hepatitis A can generally spread the disease from two weeks before symptoms start, to one week after symptom onset. Hepatitis A virus is found in the stool of infected people. The viru s is highly contagious and is spread by the fecal -oral route. Pe rson-to-person transmission is possible when handwashing is inadequate after using the restroom, or when caring for an infected person, such as changing a diaper or cleaning stool. Hepatitis A is also spread when food or drinks, such as fruits, vegetables, raw shellfish, and untreated water or ice are contaminated. Hepatitis A is not transmitted by blood. Multiple states across the country have reported outbreaks of hepatitis A, primarily amo ng people who use drugs and people experiencing homelessness. Si nce the hepatitis A outbreaks were first identified in 2016, more than 15,000 cases, 8,500 (57%) hospitalizations, and 140 deaths as a result of hepatitis A virus infection have been reported. There is no specific treatment for hepatitis A, but there is a vaccine to prevent the infection. Two doses of hepatitis A vaccine separated by six months are routinely recommended for all children at 12 to 23 months and required if the child is attending child care in North Dakota. The vaccine is also recommended for people traveling to or working in a high -risk area, men who have sex with men, people experiencing homelessness, users of injection drugs, people who anticipate having close contact with an in ternational adoptee from high risk area, people who have clottin g disorders, those who may be exposed in a laboratory setting, and those with chronic liver disease. There were no cases of hepatitis A reported in North Dakota in 201 8.

Chronically infected persons are at an increased risk for cirrhosis and liver cancer. Rates of new infection and acute disease are highest among adults, but chron ic infections are more likely to occur in people infected as infants and young children. For infants and children, the two primary sources of hepatitis B infection are peri natal transmission from infected mothers and horizontal transmission from infected h ousehold contacts. The hepatitis B birth dose prevents between 70 -95% of transmission to infants born to hepatitis B surface antigen positive women. When hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) is given in conjunction with the vaccine, between 85-95% of infecti ons are prevented. The North Dakota Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program seeks to prevent perinatal hepatitis B infections by managing infants born to hepatitis B positive women. Case management includes contacting hepatitis B positive women before de livery to educate them regarding hepatitis B virus transmission and t he importance of HBIG and hepatitis B vaccine for their infant. Household contacts are also identified and recommended to be tested or vaccinated, depending on the circumstances. The peri natal hepatitis B coordinator then notifies the hospital where the wo man is planning to deliver so they are prepared to administer HBIG and hepatitis B vaccine to the infant at birth. After delivery, the perinatal hepatitis B coordinator works with the i nfant's pediatrician to ensure that all three doses of vaccine are gi ven, and that hepatitis B serology testing is performed at 9 months of age, 1 -2 months after the last dose of vaccine. Hepatitis B serology testing is essential to determine if the infant gained protection from the vaccine and to ensure that he/she did not develop hepatitis B infection. If the infant does not show a protective immune response from vaccination, one additional hepatitis B dose must be given, and the infant must be retested. The number of births to hepatitis B positive women continues to incre ase in North Dakota. In 201 8, there were 4 2 births to hepatitis B positive women.

The survey is self -reported by schools and is sent out each fall through the Department of Public Instruction. The survey is submitted online and is due around mid -November. Kindergarten vaccination rates for the 20 18-2019 school year were around 94 % for all five of the required vaccinations. The percent of personal belief exemptions increased again this year. Figure 6: North Dakota Kindergarten Entry Immunization Rates for the 201 8-2019 School Year The survey also indica ted that schools that exclude students who are not up -to-date on immunizations have higher kindergarten vaccination rates than schools that do not exclude students who are not up -to-date. Exemption rates are similar in both situations.

Figure 10: North Dakota Kindergarten Entry Exemption Rates from 2011 to 2018, Stratified by School Type Seventh Grade Vaccination Rates Tdap and meningococcal conjugate (MCV4) vaccines were first required for middle school entry in 2008. This was changed for the 2014 -2015 school year, to require Tdap and MCV4 for seventh grade entry to standardize the recomme ndations. For the 20 18-2019 school year, Tdap and meningococcal coverage rates were about 94% and 9 3%, respectively.

With timely, detailed immunization data, the ability of all stakeholders to coordinate effective vaccination strategies and help maintain high coverage rates is greatly increased. A widely used and accepted source for immunization data is immunization information systems (IIS). IISs are confidential, population -based, computerized systems that attempt to collect immunization data for all persons within a state or geographical area.1 Using data f rom the North Dakota IIS (NDIIS), the NDDoH Immunization Program can monitor immunization coverage rates by health care pro vider or geographical area (i.e. county and state) in real time. North Dakota health care providers are required to enter immunizatio ns administered to anyone 18 years of age and younger into the NDIIS. Adult immunizations are not required to be entered, h owever the NDIIS has high adult participation with approximately 9 7% of all North Dakota adults represented in the NDIIS with at least one adult immunization. NDIIS data does have limitations. Any IIS is only as good as the data entered. Inaccurate or out -of-date address information could mean there are infants, adolescents and adults no longer living in North Dakota that are still bei ng included in North Dakota coverage assessments. The NDIIS does have functionality and processes in place to remove duplic ate patient and dose records and to merge fragmented records. However, it's possible that duplicate patient records are artificially inflating the NDIIS denominator data and fragmented records could look like multiple patients are not up -to-date when there is really one patient who is up -to- date. Additionally, the NDIIS may have incomplete records for individuals who have moved into Nor th Dakota and do not have a record from another state or for adults that have been to a healthcare provider not reporting adult data to the NDIIS. There are also two U.S. Air Force Bases in North Dakota that do not report any immunizations to the NDIIS . Individuals receiving immunizations on the U.S. Air Force Bases will not have a complete record in the NDIIS but may still be included in the coverage assessments. NDIIS immunization coverage rates are published quarterly on the NDDoH immunization program w ebsite at www.ndhealth.gov/immunize . 2018 Epidemiology Repor t 16 Infant Immunization Coverage By 19 months of age, infants are recommended to receive four doses of diphtheria, tetanus a nd pertussis (DTaP), three doses of polio, one dose of MMR, three doses of hepatitis B, three or four doses of Haemophilius influenzae type B (Hib), one dose of vari cella (chickenpox) and four doses of pneumococcal (PCV13) vaccines (4:3:1:3:3:1:4 series). Additionally, infants are also recommended to receive two doses of hepatitis A vaccine. Immunization rates for infants 19 -35 months of age for the complete 4:3:1:3:3 :1:4 vaccine series in 2018 saw very little variation compared to previous years, with a sm all increase in the fourth quarter . Quarter 4 2016 had a series rate of 69.7 % compared to 69.8 % for quarter 4 of 2017 and 69.7% for quarter 4 of 2018. Coverage rates for hepatitis A continue to see fluctuations between quarters with quarter 1 of 2018 havin g a rate of 60.2%, increasing to 61.7 % in quarter 2, decreasing to 59.9% in quarter 3 and increasing again to 61.9% in quarter 4. Figure 1 2: North Dakota Immunization Rates for Infants Ages 19 - 35 Months Using the 4:1:3:3:3:1:4 Vaccine PCV13 Hep A 2018 Epidemiology Repor t 17 Adolescent Immunization Coverage Adolescents are recommended to receive one dose of Tdap, one dose of MCV4 and two or three doses of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines at 11 -12 years of age. Adolescen ts are also recommended to receive a second dose of MCV4 vaccine at 16 -18 years of age a nd in 2014, a category B recommendation was made for administering meningococcal B vaccine. Since 201 5, North Dakota has seen a steady increase in coverage rates for re commended adolescent immunizations. At the end of 201 8, 78.4% of adolescents 13 -17 years of age were up -to-date with one dose of Tdap and 78.0% were up -to-date with one dose of MCV4 vaccine. Approximately 59.6% of adolescents 16 -17 years of age were up -to-date with their second dose of MCV4. Meningococcal B vaccine is not routinely recommende d for all adolescents. Uptake for meningococcal B vaccine remains low with only 13.4% of adolescents up -to-date with the complete series. However, uptake for meningococ cal B has been steadily increasing since the first quarter of 2016. In 2007, a second d ose of varicella (chickenpox) vaccine was recommended for kids at 4 -6 years of age. Catch -up vaccination was recommended for all kids and adolescents who had only recei ved one dose, however North Dakota is implementing the two -dose requirement for school i ncrementally (adding one additional grade each school year). At the end of 201 8, 82.4 % of adolescents 13 -17 years were up -to-date with two doses of varicella vaccine co mpared to 73.9% at the end of 2015. Figure 1 3: North Dakota Immunization Rates for Adolescents Ages 13 - 17 years, 201 5-2018 Coverage rates for HPV, although lower than Tdap and MCV4, have seen much greater increases over the last four years. By the en d of 201 8, 65.2% of females and 61.7% of males 13 to 17 years had started the HPV vaccine series. This is an increase of 9.5% for females and 15.1% for males since 201 5. Additionally, 5 3.8% of females and 48.8% of males are up -to-date with the complete HPV vaccine series. This is an increase of 11.2% for females and 17.5% for B Chickenpox or Varicella 2018 Epidemiology Repor t 18 Figure 1 4: North Dakota HPV Immunization Rates for Adolescents ages 13 - 17 years, 201 5-2018 UTD Males Start Males UTD 2018 Epidemiology Repor t 19 Adult Immunization Cov erage There are also routine vaccine recommendations for adults 19 years of age and older. All adults are recommended to receive one dose of Tdap vaccine. At age 50, adults are recommended to receive zoster (shingles) vaccine . Pneumococcal conjugate vacci ne (PCV13) is recommended for all adults at age 65 followed by a dose of pneu mococcal polysaccharide (PPSV23) vaccine 12 months later. North Dakota has seen a steady increase in all adult immunization coverage over the last f our years. According to the NDI IS, 55.4% of adults had received their Tdap vaccine as of the end of 201 8. This is a n increase of 11.3% since 201 5. Figure 1 5: North Dakota Tdap Immunization Rates for Adults 19 and Older, 201 5-2018 Adults were previously recommended to receive one dos e of zoster (shingles ) vaccine, brand name Zostavax\u00ae, at age 60. However, in October 2017 a new zoster vaccine, Shingrix\u00ae, was licensed for adults ages 50 and older . Shingrix\u00ae vaccine is recommended as a two -dose series, and there was such high demand for the vaccine that there has been a shortage of Shingrix\u00ae since early 2018, mak ing it difficult to vaccinate all adults with the complete two -dose series. Prior to the licensure of Shingrix\u00ae vaccine, t he coverage rate for Zostavax\u00ae vaccine for adults met t he Healthy People 2020 goal of 30% for zoster vaccine in quarter 1 of 2015 and continued to exceed it every quarter since. Since the introduction of Shingrix\u00ae vaccine, 6% of adults had received their first dose by the end of 2018 and 3% of adults had complet t 20 Figure 1 6: North Dakota Zoster Immunization Rates for Adults 60 and Older, 201 5-2018 Approximately 5 4.9% of all adults were up -to-date with one dose of PCV13 at the end of 201 8. Since 201 5, the coverage rate for PPSV23 h as seen a slow but steady increase from 38.9% to 47.3% . This vaccine is recommended to be administered after PCV13 , and in the third quarter of 2016, the rate for PCV13 exceeded the coverage rate for PPSV23. Figure 1 7: North Dakota Pneumococcal Immunizati on Rates for People Epidemiology Repor t 21 Epidemiology and Surveillance Program The Epidemiology and Surveillance Program is responsible for the management and surveillance of infectious disease activities, such as enteric/foodborne, vector -borne, zoonotic, influenza, antib iotic resistant infections, parasitic infections, waterborne diseases, non -flu respiratory viruses, health care - associated infections, and mycotic infections. Additionally, the Epidemiology and Surveillance Program provides cross cutting and flexible epide miology and health information systems capacity, which addres ses a variety of infectious diseases. Additional functions include management of the NDDoH's syndromic surveillance program, general infection control assessment and outbreak response activities. 2018 Epidemiology Repor t 22 Electronic Laboratory Reporting (ELR) Alicia Torfin , NEDSS Coordinator Electronic Laboratory Reporting (ELR) is the electronic transmission of laboratory reports from hospitals, public and reference laboratories to the Division of Disease Control. ELR can improve timeliness, reduce manual data entry errors, and result in reports that are more complete. The NDDoH began receiving electronic laboratory reports in 2009 with the NDDoH's Division of Microbiology (DM). At the end of 2018, NDDoH had 30 laborato ries in production with ELR, six of which had be en added in 2018. The total numbers of laboratory results received in 2018 were 37,105. Of those, 31,150 (84%) were reported through ELR 18) . 1 8: Number of ELR Messages Received by NDDoH, 2 018 Of the laboratory reports created in Maven by ELR, 92% were created in Maven in zero to three days of the result date of the initial laboratory report, 91% had zero to five days between the collection date of the laboratory specimen and the date of result of the initial laboratory report, and 96% were created in Maven in zero to eleven days between collection date of the laboratory specimen. Of the laboratory reports created in Maven by non -ELR methods (i.e., manual data entry), 43% were created in M aven in zero to three days of the result dat e of the initial laboratory report, 79% had zero to five days between the collection date of the laboratory specimen and the date of result of the initial laboratory report, and 63% were created in Maven in zero to eleven days between collection date of th e laboratory specimen ( Epidemiology Repor t 23 Figure 1 9: Comparison of Laboratory Reports Reported to the NDDoH, 201 8 The number of laboratory reports received via ELR increased by 16.6% from the 26,716 records received in 2017. ELR timeliness appears to have stayed fairly consistent, with 92% of reports being created in Maven in zero to three days, 91% of reports having zero to five days between the collection date and the result date, and 96% of reports having zero to eleven days between the specimen collection date and the date when the laboratory report was created in Maven in 2017. Implementation of ELR improves timeliness and accuracy of laboratory results. A greater proportion of cases are entered into Ma ven more quickly from the date of laboratory result when they are reported ELR than non - ELR. This results in quicker follow -up time for NDDoH staff to speak with confirmed cases to gain more accurate risk factors or exposures and to implement any public he alth action that is needed. Additionally, fewer data entry errors are made with ELR than non -ELR reporting methods. Ongoing assessment will continue to ensure data timeliness and accuracy of all laboratory reports. 929196 4379 63 020406080100120 Percent of laboratory reports created in Maven in 0-3 days of the result date of the laboratory reportPercent of laboratory speicmens that had a result date in 0-5 days after collection datePercent of laboratory reports created in Maven in 0-11 days of the collection date of the laboratory specimenPercent ELR Non_ELR 2018 Epidemiology Repor t 24 Respiratory Diseases Levi Schlosse r, Influenza Surveillance Epidemiologist 2017-2018 Influenza Season Influenza surveillance activities for the 2017 -2018 season officially began August 1, 2017. The NDDoH requires all laboratory -identified cases of influenza, including positive rapid antig en tests, be individually reported to the NDDoH year -round. The timing for the season was average, with case counts increasing i n December, and peaking the week ending January 27th. This season marked a slight change from the previous season (2016 - 17), whi ch peaked later, in March, but saw slightly less total reported cases at 7,507 cases. At 8,530, the 2017 - 18 season had the most cases ever recorded in a single influenza season in North Dakota. However, this may likely be due to increased electronic repor ting, meaning fewer cases of influenza were missed by surveillance due to underreporting. This contrasts with the 2015 -16 season , which saw less than 2000 cases, as well as the 2014 -15 season, which saw fewer cases (6,443 total reported case s), but was con sidered a fairly severe season due to a vaccine mismatch. Overall, the severity of the 2017 -18 season was moderate, with the inf luenza A H3N2 strain predominating. Twenty -two percent (1,866) of the cases for 2017 -18 were influenza B, a lower proportion tha n in previous years. The smaller -than-average B wave did not detract from the overall high case count. North Dakota's influenza activity was generally similar to national trends, but a side -by-side comparison is not possible because influenza is not a nati onally notifiable disease.

People get exposed to Legionella when they breathe i n small droplets of water that contain Legionella bacteria. In the United States, the rate of rep orted Legionnaires' disease is increasing and has grown by nearly five and a half times since 2000. In North Dakota, there is a similar increase in reported Le gionnaires' cases. In 2018, there were 10 cases reported from seven counties (Barnes - 1, Burleig h - 2, Cass - 3, Grand Forks - 1, Ransom - 1, Richland - 1 and Ward - 1). Seventy percent of the cases were male, all 10 cases were hospitalized, and none died . The NDDoH investigated one healthcare -associated Legionnaires' disease case at a long -term care (LTC) facility. A single case of legionellosis associated with a health care facility typically will prompt a full -investigation. An environmental assessment was conducted to identify possible risks and to review the LTC facility's water management plan. No additional cases and no exceptional risks for Legionella growth were found.

Klebsiella species and E. coli are examples of Enter obacteriaceae, a normal part of the human gut bacteria that can become carbapenem resistan t. One of the more common ways that Enterobacteriaceae become resistant to carbapenems is through the production pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) enzyme. KPC breaks down carbapenems making them ineffective. The genes that code for KPC are on a highly mobile genetic element that can be transmitted from one bacterium to another thereby spreading resistance. CRE are defined as Enterobacteriaceae that are res istant to one of the following Doripenem Ertapenem Meropenem Imipenem Enterobacteriaceae testing a modified Hodge test, Carba -NP test or identified as a KPC enzyme producer, through PCR testing, OR other doc umentation that the isolate possesses a carbapenemase are also considered CRE cases. The e mergence and dissemination of carbapenem resistance among Enterobacteriaceae in the United States represent a serious threat to public health. These organisms are ass ociated with high mortality rates and have the potential to spread widely. Healthy people usually do not get CRE infections. In health care settings, CRE infections most commonly occur among patients who are receiving treatment for other conditions. Patien ts whose care requires devices like ventilators (breathing machines), urinary (bladder) ca theters, or intravenous (vein) catheters, and patients who are taking long courses of certain antibiotics are most at risk for CRE infections. Clinicians, Infection preventionists and all health care workers, as well as environmental cleaning personnel, play a critical role in slowing the spread of CRE. Transmission can be prevented by: Recognizing these organisms as epidemiologically important. Understanding the pr evalence in their region. Identifying colonized and infected patients when pres ent in the facility. Implementing regional and facility -based interventions designed to stop the transmission of these organisms. 2018 Epidemiology Repor t 42 In 2018, 27 cases of CRE were repor ted, the same as 2017, in 14 counties, with only 13 counties being repor ted in 2017. CRE incidence was 3.57 cases per 100,000 people in 2018. The counties with the highest incidence of CRE cases per 100,000 people were Sioux : 91.41, Golden Valley : 55.90 an d Oliver : 51.55. The average age was 61.9 years. People ages 85 and older had the highest age -specific incidence rate (17.88 cases per 100,000 people). Seventeen (62.9%) of the reported cases were female. Thirteen (76.4% ) of the 17 female cases, were 60 ye ars and over, while all ten males were 60 years and under , with 30% of the male cases in their thirties . The CRE organisms reported for North Dakota were identified in Burleigh, Cass, Mercer and Oliver counties.

Infecti ons of the blood, pneumonia, and infections following surgery can lead to severe illness and death in these people. However, healthy people can also develop mi ld illnesses with Pseudomonas aeruginosa , especially after exposure to water. Ear infections, es pecially in children, and more generalized skin rashes may occur after exposure to inadequately chlorinat ed hot tubs or swimming pools. Eye infections have occasionally been reported in persons using extended -wear contact lenses. All Carbapenem Resistant organisms became reportable in 2018. Patients in hospitals, especially those on breathing machines, those with devices such as catheters, and patients with wounds from surgery or from burns are potentially at risk for serious, life -threatening infections. Pseudomo nas can be spread on the hands of healthcare workers or by equipment that gets contaminated and is not properly cleaned. Pseudomonas infections are generally treated with antibiotics. Unfortunately, in hospitalized patients, Pseudomonas infections, like t hose caused by many other hospital bacteria, are becoming more difficult to treat because of incr easing antibiotic resistance. Selecting the right antibiotic usually requires that a specimen from a patient be sent to a laboratory to test to see which antib iotics might still be effective for treating the infection. As with CRE, these organisms can be a KPC enzyme producer. Pseudomonas infections can be prevented by: Careful attention to hand hygiene and environmental cleaning can substantially lower the ris k of infection. In addition, outside the hospital, avoid hot tubs or pools that may be poorly ma intained, and keep contact lenses, equipment, and solutions from becoming contaminated. 57 cases were reported in 2018 in 23 counties and one homeless person. 5 of these cases were KPC producers located in the following counties; Cass, Stutsman and Richla nd. The incidence rate was 7.55 per 100,000 people. The counties with the highest incidence rate of carbapenem resistant pseudomonas cases per 100,000 people were Cavalier 53.16, Logan 52.14 and Oliver 51.55. The average age was 65.07 years. People ages 8 5 and older had the highest age -specific incidence rate 118.85 cases per 100,000 people. 45.6% of the reported cases were male. 2018 Epidemiology Repor t 45 Acute Flaccid Myelitis (AFM) Case in North Dakota Evan Bischoff , Communicable Disease Epidemiologist The first ever case of AFM was confirmed in North Dakota in October 2018. A child with a previous diagnosis of possible acute AFM by the NDDoH was confirmed as a case of AFM by the CDC. The child was hospitalized in October 2018 and has been released. AFM is a rare , but seriou s condition that affects the nervous system, causing muscles in the arms and legs to weaken. It can be a complication follow ing a viral infection, but environmental and genetic factors may also contribute to its development. AFM appears to start with a pro dromal respiratory or gastrointestinal illness about one week before limb weakness onset. Pain in the neck or back often dir ectly precedes weakness in one or more limbs, and cranial nerve findings such as slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, and eyelid o r facial droop may occur. On exam, the weak limb(s) displays poor tone and diminished reflexes. Cerebrospinal fluid may show a lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated protein. AFM is an illness characterized by acute onset of flaccid limb weakness and magneti c resonance imaging (MRI) showing lesions in the gray matter of the spinal cord. AFM has been under investigation by the N DDoH and the CDC for the past five years. Surveillance has shown that AFM cases generally peak in the months of September and Octobe r. In the last four years, the majority of cases were reported in 2014 and 2016, and smaller numbers reported in 2015 and 20 17 throughout the United States. In October 2018 a cluster of AFM in children was identified in Minnesota. In 2018, 230 cases of AFM were reported in United States. Many infected individuals have reported respiratory illness in the week prior to the onse t of AFM symptoms. It is important to note that although colds are common during that time of year , developing AFM is extremely rare. If people notice potential symptoms of AFM, (for example, if someone is not using an arm) they should contact their health care provider as soon as possible. The NDDoH requests that all providers submit information about patients that meet the clinical criterion for AFM (sudden onset of flaccid limb weakness). Information should be sent on patients who meet the clinical crit erion, regardless of laboratory results or MRI findings . Because AFM is a relatively new condition, information on all patients is n eeded to help us better understand the spectrum of illness, and all possible causes, risk factors, and outcomes for AFM. There is no age restriction for reporting suspected cases. The case definition includes people of all ages to allow for full spectrum i nformation of the condition in both children and adults. For more information on AFM, visit www.cdc.gov/acute -flaccid -myelitis/afm -surveillance.html . To notify the NDDoH of any patients being evaluated for acute onset of flaccid limb weakness, please call the Division of Disease Control at 701.328.2378. 2018 Epidemiology Repor t 46 Infant Botulism Case in North Dakota Laura Cronquist, Enteric/Vector -borne/Zoonotic Disease Epidemiologist In July 2018 , the NDDoH was notified of a suspected infant botulism case. The patient presented with constipation, poor feeding, and decreased muscle tone. Epidemiologists from the NDDoH consulted with the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) Infant Bo tulism Treatm ent and Prevention Program (IBTPP) to arrange for the infant to be evaluated by an on -call physician . The IBTPP specialist determined the case was highly suspect for infant botulism. While laboratory tests were pending, the child received Baby BIG\u00ae, the anti-botulism -toxin antibody treatment for infant botulism types A and B. Laboratory testing performed by the Minnesota Department of Health confirmed infant botulism type B. The patient responded well to supportive care and BabyBIG\u00ae treatment . The child recovered without any complications. Infant botulism is defined as an illness occurring in persons less than one year of age caused by consumption of Clostridium botulinum spores, which are found in soils and dust worldwide. The spores can coloniz e and produce toxins in the digestive tracts of infants . Honey has been identified as a possible source of C. botulinum spores and should not be given to children younger than one year of age. The incubation period for infant botulism is estimated to be 3 to 30 days. S igns and symptoms of infant botulism may include constipation, loss of facial expression, poor feeding, diminished suckling and crying ability, neck and peripheral weakness (floppy baby syndrome), and respiratory failure. If untreated, the ill ness can progress to cause descending paralysis of respiratory muscles, arms, and legs. Other types of botulism include foodborne botulism, botulism. Foodborne botulism is caused by consuming foods that have been contaminated with botulinum toxin. Homemade foods that have been improperly canned, preserved, or fermented are the most common sources of foodborne botulism. According to the CDC, improperly preserved vegetables that have a low acid content , such as green beans, corn, beets, and asparagus, are the most common cause of botulism outbreaks in the United States. Wound botulism is caused by C. botulinum spores that enter a wound and produce toxins. Injection drug use, especially black tar heroin, and contamination of wounds and open fractures wi th dirt or soil can cause wound botulism. Adult intestinal toxemia can happen if C. botulinum spores colonize an adult's intestines and produce toxin. Adult intestinal toxemia is very rare and not well unde rstood, but may be more likely to occur in people who have serious health conditions or altered intestinal flora due to antimicrobial use. Iatrogenic botulism is caused by the injection of too much botulinum toxin for cosmetic or medical reasons. All types of botulism can be fatal and should be considered medical emergencies. For additional information about botulism, please visit www.cdc.gov/botulism/ . 2018 Epidemiology Repor t 47 Multistate Outbreak of Salmonella Infections Linked to Kratom Laura Cronquist, Enteric/Vector -borne /Zoonotic Disease Epidemiologist Salmonella bacteria are one of the most common causes of foodborne illness in the United States. Salmonella infection (salmonellosis) typically causes diarrhea, fever, and abdom inal pain. Symptoms usually begin within 12 to 72 hours after ingesting the bacteria, but can take as long as 16 days. Symptoms generally resolve without treatment in four to seven days, but severe cases and cases involving complications may require hospit alization. Severe illness is more likely to occur in infants, the elderly, and those with impaired immune systems. In January 2018, a Salmonella isolate from a blood specimen was receive d by the NDDoH DM for routine laboratory analysis, including serotypin g and pulsed -field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The isolate was identified as Salmonella I 4,[5],12:b: - and the PFGE pattern was linked to a multistate PulseNet cluster. No associated foo d, animal, or other exposure had been linked to the cluster of illness es at this point in the outbreak investigation. The ND case was interviewed and did not report any high -risk exposures or contact with ill individuals, however, the case did mention enca psulating and consuming a dietary supplement called kratom that had be en purchased online. The NDDoH enteric disease epidemiologist mentioned the ND case's reported exposure to kratom on a CDC multistate outbreak conference call. Following the call, other states began asking their cases about exposure to kratom. After multip le cases reported exposure to kratom prior to becoming ill, the scope of the investigation was narrowed, and a focused questionnaire was developed by CDC epidemiologists to capture infor mation about exposures to kratom products. The NDDoH epidemiologist wo rked with the ND case to collect all remaining kratom product for laboratory testing at the DM. The leftover product yielded a Salmonella isolate that matched the strain identified in cl inical isolates. The NDDoH issued a news release on March 2, 2018, war ning the public against consuming kratom. As the national outbreak investigation progressed, several state and federal public health agencies collected additional kratom products to test for Salmonella contamination. Multiple serotypes of Salmonella were detected, including Salmonella Heidelberg, Salmonella Javiana, Salmonella Okatie, Salmonella Weltevreden, and Salmonella Thompson. A total of 85 different DNA fingerprints of Salmonella were identified in kratom products. Clinical isolates with matching str ains in the PulseNet database were added to the outbreak investigation. The investigation was closed on May 24, 2018, with a total of 199 people infected with the outbreak strains of Salmonella from 41 states. Thirty -eight percent of ill people were hospit alized, and no deaths were reported. Several companies issued recalls for kratom products because they could be contaminated with Salmonella . Although the outbreak investigation is over, the CDC continues to warn consumers that contaminated products may st ill be available for purchase because the investigation was not able to identify a single, common source of contaminated kratom.

The HIV Surveillance program summarizes data to help the NDDoH to: Monitor the incidence and estimated prevalence of HIV/AIDS in the state Assess the risks for HIV infection and develop effective HIV preve ntion strategies Develop surveillance methods to allow for a more current estimate and characterization of HIV/AIDS risks and needs The HIV Prevention program key act ivities include: Providing information and materials on HIV transmission and how to prote ct individuals from contracting HIV Providing testing to those at risk for contracting HIV Collaborate and support the Community Planning Group in identifying HIV prev ention needs and targeted intervention in identified priority populations The Ryan White Part B program serves to: Address the unmet health needs of persons living with HIV disease Optimize health outcomes by funding health care and support services to enhance health care access and retention in care Provide case management to link clients t o appropriate resources The NDDoH STD program key activities include: Monitoring the inciden ce and estimated prevalence of STDs in the state; diseases that are monitored include chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis Utilizing surveillance data to better char acterize STD risks and identify disproportionately affected populations Assessing the risks for STD infection and develop effective STD prevention programs; these programs include partner notification and linkage to care The NDDoH TB Prevention a nd Control Program collaborates with clinicians and local public health units to ensure perso ns with TB receive effective and timely treatment and that contact investigations are performed to minimize the spread of TB. TB data is summarized to help the NDD oH to: Monitor the incidence and estimated prevalence of TB in the state Utilize surveillanc e data to better characterize the risks and needs of people infected with TB in North Dakota Assess the risks for TB infection and develop effective TB prevention programs The NDDoH Viral Hepatitis program key activities include: Monitoring the incidenc e and estimated prevalence of viral hepatitis in the state; diseases that are monitored include hepatitis A, hepatitis B and hepatitis C Educating health care pro fessionals that serve individuals at risk for viral hepatitis and target populations who are at risk for viral hepatitis Collaborating with the HIV program to integrate viral hepatitis testing into the counseling, testing and referral (CTR) program for t hose at risk for viral hepatitis infections; these individuals are also offered hepatitis A and B vaccinations Develop referral services for medical care and case management for chronically infected persons 2018 Epidemiology Repor t 49 HIV Program Shari Renton, HIV Surveillan ce Coordinator HIV/AIDS North Dakota traditionally ranks near the bottom for incidence cases each year of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV/AIDS) in the United States. In 201 8, the incident case rate was 5. 1 cases per 100,000 people. In 201 8, 84 HIV/AID S cases were reported to the NDDoH. This count includes cases being diagnosed for the first time in the state, and cases previously diagnosed elsewhere who moved to North Dakota during the year. In 201 8, 39 North Dakota residents were diagnosed with HIV/ AIDS and reported to the NDDoH. Five of those newly diagnosed HIV cases were advanced enough to meet the case definition for AIDS at the time of diagnosis. Seventy -two percent of HIV/AIDS cases reported in 20 18 were male. Cumulative (2001 -2018) HIV/AIDS Cases HIV and AIDS have been reportable conditions in North Dakota since 1984. The cumulative reported infections as of December 31, 201 8, stands at 1,065 HIV/AIDS cases.

AIDS cases reported in this section met the criteria for AIDS at first d iagnosis. From 201 4 to 201 8, 180 HIV/AIDS cases were diagnosed in North Dakota. Twenty -four percent met the criteria for AIDS at time of diagnosis, while the remaining 7 6% were diagnosed as an HIV infection. S ixty-nine percent were male, and 31% were femal e.

In 2018, a total of 9,029 cases of active TB were repo rted in the United States, marking the lowest number of reported cases in a year on record. Even with this decline, however, national trends show that the goal of eliminating Tuberculosis in the United States (annual incidence of <1 case per 1 million pers ons) will not be attained in the 21st century without greatly increased investment in detection and treatment of latent TB infection (LTBI). Figure 4 4: North Dakota Active Tuberculosis Case Counts and U.S. and ND Tuberculosis Disease Rates, 2001 -2018 Seve ral medical conditions put people with TB infection at increased risk for developing active TB. People infected with TB who also have HIV infection are 26 -31 times more likely to develop active TB than persons without HIV infection. Diabetes triples the ri sk of developing active TB as well as complicating both the clinical course of TB and worsening glycemic control. Co-morbidities for the persons who were identified with active TB in North Dako ta in 2018: HIV (8% of cases), being prescribed immunosuppre ssive medication (8% of cases), having low body weight (15% of cases) and diabetes mellitus (31% of cases). Active TB in the United States is most common among people who travel to or who were b orn in countries with high rates of TB. From 2014 - 2018, no n-US born persons accounted for 66% of reported cases in North Dakota. 0.01.02.03.04.05.06.0 051015202530 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Rate per 100,000Number of Cases # Cases ND Rate US Rate 2018 Epidemiology Repor t 57 Figure 4 5: Number of Active TB Cases Reported in North Dakota by Country of Birth, 201 4-2018 Although incidence of TB in North Dakota is low, cases reported demonstrate a rac ial disparity.

While many of those infected perso ns will never develop TB disease, identifying and treating those who are infected is the best tool to prevent active TB infections from developing. While many providers ha ve reported TB infections to NDDoH for many years, LTBI officially became reportab le in North Dakota in 2018. The case definition adopted in 2018 was recommended by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) . In order for cases to meet the CSTE case definition, providers must report the results of the laboratory, clini cal and radiologic findings as part of the assessment to rule out active TB disease. The data below shows reports of laboratory evidenc e of TB infection for 2014 -2017 and only cases that meet the confirmed case definition starting in 2018. Figure 49: Number of Latent Tuberculosis Infections Reported in North Dakota, 201 4-2018 *The decrease in the number of reported LTBI cases in 2018 is due to the establishment of a new LTBI case definition. 544 355553725 393 0100200300400500600700800 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018Number of Cases Year 2018 Epidemiology Repor t 61 Sexually Transmitted Diseases Shari Renton, STD Surveillance Coordinator Chlamydia In 201 8, 3,528 cases of chlamydia were reported to the NDDoH, a rate of 4 64.2 cases per 100,000 persons.

These rates are higher than the rate of 180 per 100,000 people for all of North Dakota. An additional five counties have gonorrhea rates higher than the North Dakota rate. Table 1: Epi Facts of North Dakota Gonorrhea Cases, 201 8 How are cases being treated? 80 (6%) cases were treated inappropriately . Reminder: the appropriate treatment for gonorrhea is dual therapy of 1 gram azithromycin and 250mg IM ceftriaxone. How ma ny cases were interviewed? 64 percent of cases were reported as being interviewed. How many partners were tested and treated? 48 percent of cases reported no sexual partners. Of reported partners, 375 were referred for follow -up and partner services, What are the risk factors for gonorrhea? For cases with risk factor information, 14 percent reported injection drug use , 39 percent reported sex while high or intoxicated, and 1 7 percent reported having anonymous sex partners. How many were tested for HI V? Only 38 percent of cases were reported as being tested for HIV.
