Due to cancer's complexity and heterogeneity, we obviously cannot expect to find one thera- peutic solution for all the cases and its forms. The trem endous increase in our knowledge of the molecular biology of carcinogenesis (the mech anisms of cancer formation) has led to the development of new therapeutic approaches du ring the past 10-20 years. The most important can be classified as gene therapy, vaccine th erapy (or \"active\" immunotherapy) and antibody therapy (or \"passive\" immunotherapy). All the new approaches to cancer therapy are linke d by the scientific finding that cancer is a disease resulting from the accumulation of genetic modifications within a cell. In delineating these new therapeutic strategies, the basic premis e is to determine as many properties of can- cer cells as possible and outline an effective bi omedical action against them. It is very diffi- cult to distinguish consistently between the diffe rent therapeutic approaches because they do not appear as clear cut methods, but rather as ba sic strategies or concepts that often follow the same paths and use the same tools. Almost all approaches focus on severa l different targets in the patient's body. Altering cancer cells (inside or outside the body, connected with delivery via gene therapy) and/or cance r-specific targets in combinati on with the activation or support of the patient's own immune system seems to yi eld a promising treatment . Nevertheless, it is still not fully understood which components of the immune syst em are best addressed by vac- cine or antibody approaches. Medical results and prospects Most of the new therapies are at an early stag e of development. The ones that currently are medically most relevant either follow the prev entive vaccine approach (directed at \"transmis- antibodies such as trastuzumab (Herceptin\u00ae). An immune response, the goal of \"active\" immunothera- pies, has a potentially long-term clinical impact on the course of the disease by stabilising the patient's condition, and thus prolonging survival, rath er than by destroying much or all of the tumour. The patients most likely to benefit are, therefore, t hose who have a minor tumour burden or who have undergone surgical tumour removal but have a high risk of relapse. All three fields of innovative cancer therapy hold significant potential for the treatment of tumour patients within the next decade, wher eby vaccine and antibody therapies are probably the most promising, while gene therapy will in many cases serve rather as a supporting method. Traditional hormonal and chemotherapies w ill not lose their relevance in the fore- seeable future, but will increasingly be comb ined with different forms of immunotherapies. Surgery will remain important as well, firstly, because it is n ecessary for histological diagno- sis and, secondly, because surgery will be an inte gral part of all those innovative treatments delivered directly to the tumour tissue. Research funding and economic aspects The new approaches to cancer therapy seem to be well-represented in the EU research pro- grammes and funding in European Framework Programmes FP6 and FP7. FP7 will reinforce the clinical aspects of cancer re search. It is important to be aw are of the weaknesses of cancer immunotherapies, in principle due to products that are often very complex and include sev- eral compounds, to the laborious technical procedures that are n ecessary or to the use of pa- tient-specific commercial pot ential of many immunotherapeu tic products is limited. This field of research thus has an enormous need for the provision of economic resources in order to continue advancing. Although the question of cost-effectiveness cannot reasonably be addressed in more detail for most of the new therapies due to their early st age of research and development, these rather individual or even personalised treatments will presumably be very cost intensive. Even to- day, use of the anti-cancer drug Herceptin\u00ae repres ents a substantial financial challenge to the public health insurance systems in many Europ ean countries, leading to very heterogeneous administration rates for economic reasons. On the other hand, while the costs of treatment will certainly increase, further developments in cancer therapy will push forward general sci- entific and medical innovation and improvement , leading to positive economic and societal effects. Adjusting approval procedures and facilitating access to technology At the moment, cancer immunotherapies are subject to the same regulatio ns as the production of any other medical product for human use. Th e standard clinical study designs used for on- cology drug development are based on criteria that are suitable for conventional chemother- apy but less appropriate for can cer vaccines, which are much more complex and heterogene- ous. With the introduction of common EU regulati ons, a significant drop in the numbers of clinical cancer vaccine trials has been observe d in Europe. Guidelines regarding the manufac- ture, quality control, and preclinical and clini cal testing of cell-based products for human use are being developed by the European Medicines Agency and can hopefully be applied to can- cer vaccines as well. Company ownership rights and protective policie s create various barriers to the study of new cancer drugs in combinatory cancer vaccine trials. Improve d cooperation between laborato- ries, industry and clinics is essential for us to tackle remaining challenges and appreciate the full potential of cancer immunotherapy. Challenges for future tec hnology assessment studies One topic that might be illuminating for future analysis would be to check which areas of cancer research are systematically under-represe nted on the current research agenda, e.g. be- cause they promise no or only very limited economic benefits. A study should be scheduled on a medium-term basis to provide useful resu lts for the second part of the European Re- search Programme 7 (FP7) and, a bove all, for the preparation of FP8. It is imperative for as many relevant institutions, organi sations, and stakeholders as po ssible to be involved in order to gather and include all the relevant inform ation and viewpoints and because of the possible impact of such an investigation. Another important focus of future studies coul d be the possible improvement of the EU regu- lation on clinical studies and cl inical testing with the aim of increasing medical performance and economic competitiveness. In view of th e demands from many areas of up-to-date drug and therapy development for current evaluation and approval procedures to be adjusted, the question should be considered whether restricting studies to a single technology or, on the contrary, incorporating differe nt case studies would give more comprehensive results. 1. Introduction Cancer is one of the main health problems of mankind. Despite extens ive research being con- ducted over many years, effective cures have be en developed only for some forms of cancer, so that the menace is not subs tantially reduced. The search for new and better therapies is a constant challenge to the bi ological and medical sciences and should undoubtedly be sup- ported by European Research Policy in a very fundamental way. The following paper is the fina l result of the technology assessm ent (TA) pre-study \"Future development of cancer therapy\". The mission of this pre-study carried out on behalf of the European Parliament's Scientific Technologi cal Options Assessment (STOA) Panel was to give an overview of the state of research on cancer aetiology and therapy on the basis of available literature (especially from TA studies covering aspects of the s ubject) as well as an analysis of the status of cancer research in the European Framework Programme. During the project, the analysis became focussed on a more detailed picture of the most promising cur- rent cancer therapy approaches, i.e. ge ne therapy, vaccine th erapy and immunotherapy. The overall aim of this pre-study is to provide a basis for the STOA panel to decide on more comprehensive and detailed analyses or TA studies covering the subject of cancer research and therapy. Methodology and scope of the project A preliminary literature scan (conducted in the preparation phase of the project) revealed hardly any relevant TA studies or other high-l evel policy consulting reports dealing with the topic \"current cancer therapy approaches\". The lit erature analysis thus had to be expanded to include reviews and original papers in scientific journals. On th e basis of a first analysis of relevant web-based information, as well as avai lable reviews and interv iews with specialists (from research & development departments of uni versities, national institutes, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as well as health pr ofessionals from hospitals), four therapy approaches were identified, which represent th e most advanced biomedical research and de- velopment and which are regarded as playing an important role for cancer treatment in the near future: gene therapy, stem cell therapy, vaccine therapy and immunotherapy (also referred to as antibody or \"biological\" therapy). Detailed research of the literature (coveri ng publications from 2002 to 2006), using these terms and related key words, revealed a list of some 150 articles. An analysis of these papers was used as the basis for a draft background pape r and a questionnaire, mainly orientated to- wards the relationship of, synergies between an d comparison of the different therapeutic ap- proaches. The background paper and questionnaire were used as a starting point for collabo- ration with six experts, all of them scientis ts and physicians, coveri (Stem Ce ll Therapy), Marie Sv ane and Dr. Per thor Straten (Vaccine Therapy), Prof. Dr. Michael Untch (Antibody/Immunotherapy), Prof. Dr. Michael Weller (Neuro-oncology), Prof. Dr. Burghardt Wittig (Gene Therapy). All six contributed to the proj ect by answering the questionnaire and by writing a short status report (expert opinion) on their sp ecial area of expertise, and f our of them presented their point of view during the STOA Workshop \"New Therapies for Cancer: Prospects, Promises and Problems\" on February 7, 2007 in the European Parliament in Brussels. The results of the literature revi ew, the answers from the questionnaires as well as the results of the expert opinions (cited as \"N.N., expert opinion\") and a dditional information from the presentations have been integrated in a condens ed form in this paper. Contributions by other participants from the discussions during the workshop were also taken into account, espe- cially with regard to the concluding sections of the report (Sects. 10 & 11). Structure of the report The following two sections (2 & 3) provide an introductory overview of cancer as a basic medical problem and of cancer incidence and mo rtality in the EU, taking Germany as an ex- ample. Section 4 then goes into some detail regarding the molecular biology of carcinogene- sis - quite a complicated and demanding scientif ic issue, but unavoidable as a precursor to depicting and discussing the new therapeutic approaches in sections 5 (gene therapy), 6 (im- munotherapy) and 7 (vaccine therapy). Since the examples of exploring stem cells as thera- peutic tools in the fight against cancer are very rare, we decided not to classify stem-cell ther- apy as a distinct category, but to regard it as part of the gene therapy approaches. Basically, as our analysis shows, it is very difficult to distinguish between the di fferent therapeutic ap- proaches, both in terms of classification (esp ecially when the terms \"biological\", \"vaccine\", \"antibody\" and/or \"immuno\" are not used consistently) as well as of conceptual overlaps, since in many cases different therapeutic appro aches are combined. Therefore, a comparison of the therapeutic approaches (i n section 8) does not lead to any judgment on alternatives, but rather to an examination of their synergies. The coverage of cancer research and therapy by the European research programmes is delineated in section 9. Section 10 then summarises the insights gained by this report, and in the final section 11, some ideas are presented on possi- ble future analyses and studi es covering the subject of cancer research and therapy. The complete list of scientific publications yi elded by the literature scan, as well as the com- pleted questionnaires and presentation slides fr om the workshop are provided separately in a supplement aimed at readers w ith specialised interests.

Out of a total of 58 million deaths worldwide in 2005, cancer accounted for 7.6 million or 13%. The main types of cancer are: lung (1.3 million deaths/year), stomach (alm ost 1 million deaths/year), liver (660 000 deaths/year), colon (655 000 deaths/year) and breast (500 000 deaths/y ear). More than 70% of all cancer deaths in 2005 occu rred in low and middle income countries. Cancer mortality is expected to increase further, with an estim ated 9 million people dyi ng from cancer in 2015, and 11.4 million in 2030 (WHO 2006). Although much effort and scientif ic progress has been made in the last two decades, there is still a lot of work to be done in order to improve the patien ts' situation. It is important to note that cancer is not a single disease with a singl e type of treatment. There are more than 100 different kinds of cancer, each with at least one treatment. However, improvements in cancer detection, diagnosis, and treatment have increased the survival rate for many types of cancer (www.cancer.gov). 2.1 Definition and classification Not all tumours are cancerous; they can be either benign or malignant. Benign tumours are not cancerous. They can often be re moved and, in most cases, they do not reappear. Cells from benign tumours do not spre ad to other parts of the body. And, most im- portantly, benign tumours are rarely life-threatening. Malignant tumours are cancerous. Cells in malignant tumo urs are abnormal and divide with- out any control. Cancer cells invade and de stroy the tissue surrounding them. Cancer cells can also break away from a malignant tumour and enter the bloodstream or lymphatic system. Blood vessels include a network of arteries, ca pillaries, and veins through which the blood circulates in the body. The lymphatic system carries lymph and white blood cells through lymphatic vessels to all the tissues of the body. By moving through the bloodstream or lym- phatic system, cancer can spread from the primary (original) cancer site to form new tumours in other organs. The spread of cancer is called metastasis. Five main categories are used in the classification of cancer: Carcinoma : A carcinoma is a cancer found in epithelial tissue that covers or lines surfaces of organs, glands, or body stru ctures. Many carcinomas affect organs or glands that are involved in the production of secretion, such as breasts. Carcinomas account for 80-90% of all cancer cases. Sarcoma : A sarcoma is a malignant tumour growi ng connective tissue, such as carti- lage, fat, muscle, tendons, and bones. The most common sarcoma, a tumour on the bone, usually occurs in young adults. Examples of sarcoma include osteosarcoma (bone) and chondrosarcoma (cartilage). Lymphoma: Lymphoma refers to a cancer that orig inates in the nodes or glands of the lymphatic system (spleen, bone marrow), wh ich produce white blood cells and clean body fluids, and invades organs such as brain and breast. Due to morphological differences, lymphomas are classified of 46 PE 383.215 Leukaemia : Leukaemia, also known as blood cancer, is a cancer of the bone marrow that keeps the marrow from producing functioning red and white blood cells and platelets. White blood cells are needed to resist infection. Red blood cells are needed to prevent anaemia . Platelets keep the body from bruising and bleeding easily. Examples of leukaemia in clude acute myelogenous leukaemia, The terms 'myelogenous' and 'lymphocy tic' indicate the type of cells involved. Myeloma : Myeloma grows in the plasma cells of bone marrow. In some cases, the mye- loma cells accumulate in one bone and form a single tumour, called a plasmacytoma. However, in other cases, the myeloma cells accumulate in many bones, forming many bone tumours. This is called a multiple myeloma. 2.2 Causes and risk factors of cancer There is not one single cause of cancer, it is ra ther the interaction of many factors. The fac- tors involved are age, genetics, environment, chronic infections and lifestyle. As will be shown in section 4 in more detail, cancer occurs because of changes in genes responsible for cell growth and repair. These ch anges are the result of the in teraction between genetic host factors and external agents which can be categorised as (Stewart/Kleihues 2003) physical carcinogens such as ultravio let (UV) and ionising radiation occupational exposure to chemical carcinogens such as asbestos lifestyle such as heavy alcohol drinking and tobacco smoking environmental pollution in air, water and soil, e.g. sulphur dioxide (SO 2) dietary and nutritional factors su ch as excess salt intake or obesity in combination with lack of physical activity genetic susceptibility in form s of inherited mutations biological carcinogens such as chronic infections by viruses, such as hepatitis B virus (H BV, causing liver can- cer) or human papillomavirus (HPV: cer vical cancer), bacteria such as Helico- bacter pylori (causing gastric cancer) or parasites such as Schistosoma haemato- bium (causing bladder cancer) contamination of food by mycotoxins such as aflatoxi ns (products of Aspergillus fungi) causing liver cancer Tobacco use is the single most important risk factor for cancer and causes a large variety of cancer types such as lung, larynx, oesophagus, st omach, bladder, oral cavity, accounting for approximately 30% of all cancer cases. Although th ere are still some open questions, there is sufficient evidence that dietary factors also play an important role in causing cancer. This ap- plies to obesity as a compound risk factor per se as well as to the composition of the diet such as lack of fruit and vegetables and high salt in take. Lack of physical ac tivity has a distinct role as a risk factor for cancer . There is solid evidence that alcohol can cause several cancer types such as oesophagus, pharynx, larynx, liver, and breast (WHO 2006). An estimated 40% of cancer could be prevented by healt hy diet, physical activity and non-smoking. IPOL/A/STOA/ST/2006-21 PE 383.215 IPOL/A/STOA/ST/2006-21 Page 4 of 46 PE 383.215 Age has a great impact on survival rates and ty pes of the cancer. The survival rate during childhood is about 75 percent, while the survival ra te of adults with cancer is 60 percent. This difference is thought to be caused by genetic a lterations, accumulating du ring time. Cancer in children is more responsive to therapy, because children tolerate more aggressive therapy. Environmental exposures to, e.g., pesticides, fertilisers, and pow er lines have been investi- gated as a direct cause of childhood cancers. There is evidence of cancer occurring among non-related children in certain neighbourhoods and/or cities. 2.3 Therapy options in general Treatment of cancer can include surgery, radi ation therapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and biological therapy. One singl e method or a combination of methods may be used, de- pending on various factors such as the type an d location of the cancer, whether the disease has spread, and the patient's ag e and general health. As the treatment of cancer can also dam- age healthy cells and tissues, it often causes side effects, whic h are sometimes worse than the disease itself. Physicians generally discuss the treatment options carefully, weighing the likely benefits of killing cancer cells agai nst the risks of possible side effects. Surgery means an operation to remove cancer. The side effects of surgery depend on many factors, including the size and location of the tu mour, the type of operation, and the patient's general health status. In some cases, there is pain after surgery, wh ich can usually be con- trolled with drugs. It is also common for patients to feel tire d or weak for a while after sur- gery. Radiation therapy (or radiotherapy) uses high-energy rays to kill cancer cells in a targeted area. Radiation can be administered externally by an instrument that targets radiation at the tumour area. It can also be in troduced internally: need les, seeds, wires, or catheters contain- ing a radioactive substance are pl aced directly in or near the tumour. Radiation treatments are painless. The side effects are usually temporar y, and most of them can be treated or con- trolled. Radiation therapy may cause a decrease in the number of white blood cells, which help to protect the body against infections. With external radiat ion, it is also common for the patient to suffer temporary hair loss in the treat ed area and for the skin to become red, dry, tender, and itchy. External radiation does not cause body radioactiv ity. With internal radiation (or implant ra- diation), the patient may need to stay in the hospital, separate d from others, while the radia- tion level is at its peak. Implants may be perm anent or temporary. The amount of radiation in a permanent implant decreases to a safe level before the patient leaves the hospital. With a temporary implant, no radioactivity is left in the body after the implant is removed. Chemotherapy is the use of drugs that kill cancer cells throughout the body. Healthy cells can also be harmed, especially those that divide quickly. One may use one drug or a combination of drugs. The side effects of chemotherapy depend mainly on the drug(s) administered and the dose(s). Hair loss is a common side effect of chemotherapy; however, not all anticancer drugs cause this. Anti-cancer drugs may also cause temporary fatigue, poor appetite, nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea, and mouth and lip sores. Drugs that prevent or reduce nausea and vomiting are used to treat these side effects. Normal cells usually recover when chemother-apy is over, so most of the side effects gradually disappear after the treatment ends. IPOL/A/STOA/ST/2006-21 PE 383.215 IPOL/A/STOA/ST/2006-21 Page 5 of 46 PE 383.215 Hormone therapy is used to treat cancers that depend on hormones for their growth. It works by preventing cancer cells from getting or using the hormones they need to grow. This treat- ment may include the use of drugs that eith er stop the production of certain hormones or change the way hormones work. Another type of hormone therapy is surgery to remove or- gans that produce hormones. For example, the ovaries may be removed to treat breast cancer, or the testicles may be removed to treat prostate cancer. Hormone therapy can cause a number of side effects: ti redness, fluid rete ntion, weight gain, hot flashes, nausea and vomiti ng, changes in appetite, and, in some cases, blood clotting. Hormone therapy may also cause loss of bone substance in pre-menopausal women. Depend- ing on the type of hormone therapy used, these side effects may be temporary, long lasting, or permanent. Biological therapies use the body's immune system, either di rectly or indirec tly, to fight the disease and to alleviate some of the side eff ects of cancer treatment (and are a main focus of this report, see sections 6 & 7). Monoclonal antibodies, interferon, interleukin-2, and colony- stimulating factors are some of th e pharmaceutical molecules used here. The side effects caused by biological therapies vary according to the specific treatment. In general, these treatments tend to cause flu-like symptoms, such as chills, fever, muscle aches, weakness, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea. Patients also may bleed or bruise easily, get a skin rash, or suffer swelling. Thes e problems may be severe, but they usually vanish after the treatment is finished.

Cancer incidence and mort ality in the EU and Germany Although there a more than 100 different kinds of cancer worldwide, 13 types of cancer ac- count for 80%-90% of all cancerous diseases. The following figures illustrate mortality and incidence rates for cancer as a whole, as well as for three selected, important types of cancer (prostate in men, cervix in women, and colon in both). The data are taken from the \"Atlas of Health in Europe\" (WHO 2003) and from the German societ y of epidemiological cancer reg- isters (GEKID) together with the Ro bert Koch Institute (GEKID/RKI 2006). Fig. 1: Deaths from cancer in Europe (ASDR per 100000 population), 0-64 years per 100.000 population Data are given as age-standardised death rate s (ASDR), showing the number of deaths in a \"standard\" population. This facili tates international comparabili ty by removing differences in rates caused by different populati on age structures between countries. The European standard population was used to calcula te the standardised death rate (SDR) (see figure 2). 43 (http:// Page 7 of 46 383.215 Fig. 2: Deaths from cancer in Europe (ASDR per 100 000 population), 25-64 years Hungary (2001) Slovakia (2000) Ukraine (2000) Russian Federation (2001) Poland (2000) Latvia (2001) Belarus ((2001) Czech Republic (2001) Romania (2001) Lithuania (2001) Croatia (2001) Kazakhstan (2001) Estonia (2001) Republic of Moldova (2001) Yugoslavia (2000) Denmark (1999) Slovenia (2001) Bosnia and Herzegovina (1991) France (1999) TFYR Macedonia (2000) Belgium (1996) Bulgaria (2001) Iceland (1997) Ireland (2000) Netherlands (2000) Spain (1999) Germany (1999) Armenia (2000) United Kingdom (2000) Portugal (2000) Italy (1999) Austria (2001) Norway (1999) Kyrgyzstan (2001) Greece (1999) San Marino (2000) Israel (1998) Azerbajan (2001) Luxembourg (2001) Switzerland (1999) Sweden (1999) Turkmenistan (1998) Malta (2001) Finland (2001) Albania (2000) Georgia (2001) Uzbekistan (2001) Tajkistan per 100.000 population150 200 Many factors, such as variations in national definitions, incomp lete registration in some coun- tries (e.g. former USSR countries) or other spec ificities in data reco rding and processing may influence the comparability of the national sta tistics.

Carcinogenesis In order to understand, depict and analyse the recent therapy approaches to cancer, it is nec- essary to discuss the mechanisms of its fo rmation (carcinogenesis). As the non-specialist reader will soon realise, the topi cs of this paper, like the proj ect as a whole, are quite compli- cated and demanding scientific issues. There are some specific properties which dis tinguish cancer cells from healthy tissue cells (see en.wikipedia.org) : They are resistant to apoptosis (the main form of programmed cell death). They have an uncontrolled ability to divide, often at an increased rate. They are self-sufficient in growth signals. They exhibit altered differentiation. They are unsusceptible to anti-gro wth factors and c ontact inhibition. They can invade adjacent cells or tissues (usually by secreting me talloproteinases, en- zymes which digest extra-cellula r matrices from other cells). They secrete molecules, e.g. growth factors that stimulate the growth of blood vessels. 4.1. Uncontrolled proliferation Proliferation or cell division is a physiological proce ss that occurs in almost all tissues and under many circumstances. Normally, the balanc e between proliferati on and programmed cell death (usually in the form of apoptosis) is maintained by tigh tly regulating both processes to ensure the integrity and functionality of organs and tissues. Carcinogene sis is thought to be provoked by mutations of genetic elements that influence this balance (called homeostasis) of proliferation and cell death. The result is uncontrolled cell divi sion leading to tumour forma- tion. An uncontrolled and rapid prol iferation of cells can at first lead to benign tumours which can later develop into malignant tumours (can cer). Benign tumours do not spread to other parts of the body or invade other tissues, and th ey are rarely life-thre atening unless they com- press vital structures or are physiologically ac tive (for instance, pr oducing a hormone). Ma- lignant tumours can spread to distant locations (metastasise), invade other organs, and thus become life-threatening. Probably all cancers originate from a single cell (see also: the stem cell paradigm in section 4.7). This cell does not usually carry all propert ies for developing cancer at once, but devel- ops step-by-step in a \"micro evolution process\". More than one mutation seems to be neces- sary for the initiation of carcinoge nesis. Typically, a series of several mutations of different classes of genes is required before a normal cell will transform into a cancer cell (this is called the \"multi-hit model\"). These mutations c oncern genes which play vital roles in cell division, cell death, and DNA repa ir and can cause a cell to lose control of its proliferation. With every further mutation, the cell develops a selective advantage ag ainst adjacent cells. This again leads to an increased chance of the descendants acquiring extra mutations, giving them even more selective advantages until a cell clone develops, which in combination with other mutations endangers the complete organi sm. Most experts assume that 5-10 mutations are the critical number to really start this pro cess (only few theories say that 2 mutations can be sufficient). Cells that acquire only \"some\" mutations are thought to become a benign tu- mour. When cells accumulate \"enough\" mutations , they will become a malignant tumour. 383.215 IPOL/A/STOA/ST/2006-21 Page 14 of 46 PE 383.215 4.2 Oncogenes Cancer is quite definitely a gene disease. A bout 5% of cancer cases are regarded as being caused by inherited gene alterations, whereas more than 90% are results of the multifactorial gene mutations, described above. These mutations are thought to be promoted or provoked by lifestyle or environmental factors (see secti on 2.2). For example, smoking causes almost 30% of all cancer cases worldwide. Further factors are exposure to certain chemicals, obesity, nu- tritional factors and bei ng exposed to sunlight for too long (UV radiation), particularly in children who are much more susceptible to environmental threats than adults (WHO 2006). There are two major differences between cancer and so-called genetic diseases in the narrow sense. Firstly, cancer is caused mainly by mutati ons in somatic cells, whereas other genetic diseases are caused solely by mutations in the germline (however, some individuals have in- herited genetic mutations that predispose them to develop specific types of cancer). Secondly, an individual cancer does not result from a si ngle mutation, but rather from an accumulation of several incidences, depending on the type of cancer. More than 100 different genes (and their products) that play a role in carcinogenesi s have already been identified, and it is obvi- ous that there are still many more to be discovered (Fogar et al. 2005). An oncogene is any gene that en codes for a protein able to transform into cancerous cells. Of the many known oncogenes, all but a few are derived from normal cellular genes whose products (proteins) participate in cellu lar growth-controlli ng pathways. E.g. the ras gene is proto-oncogene that encodes for an intracellu lar signal-transduction protein; the mutant rasD gene is an oncogene, whose encoded oncoprot ein provides an excessive and uncontrolled growth-promoting signal. Important genes for regulation of cell growth (a nd mitosis) are so-calle d proto-oncogenes and tumour-suppressor genes. Because most proto-oncogenes are vital for basic cellular func- tions, they have been highly cons erved over the course of evolution. Proto-oncogenes Proto-oncogenes influence cell growth in a va riety of ways. Many of them produce molecules that act as \"chemical messengers \" between cells and thus cont rol cell division. There are sev- eral classes of pr oto-oncogenes, e.g.: growth factors receptors for growth factors intracellular signal-transduction molecules transcription factors (which influence the genetic activity of a cell) cell-cycle control molecules Generally, activation or convers ion of a (normal) proto-oncoge ne into an (mutated, cancer- evoking) oncogene involves a gain-of-function mutation. At present, at least three mecha- nisms are known that can produce oncogene s from the corresponding proto-oncogenes: point mutations in a proto-oncogene that result in an altered protein product reduplication of a DNA segment that include s a proto-oncogene, l eading to overexpres- sion of the encoded protein chromosomal translocation that brings a gr owth-regulatory gene under the control of a different promotor, causing inappr opriate expression of the gene IPOL/A/STOA/ST/2006-21 Page 15 of 46 PE 383.215 An oncogene formed by point mutations encodes for an oncoprotein that differs slightly from the normal protein encoded by the corresponding proto-oncogene. Reduplication of DNA segments generates oncogenes whose protein pro ducts are identical with the normal proteins. Their oncogenic effect is due to their expressi on at higher-than-norma l level (overexpression) or in cells where they are not normally expr essed. The gain-of-function mutations that con- vert proto-oncogenes to oncogenes act dominantl y, meaning that mutation in only one of the two gene copies always pres ent (called alleles) is suffi cient for induction of cancer. 4.3 Tumour-suppressor genes Tumour-suppressor genes generally encode for pr oteins that inhibit cell proliferation. The loss of one or more of these \"brakes\" contribut es to the development of cancer. Five classes of proteins are generally recognised as being encoded by tumour-suppressor genes: proteins that promote apoptos is (programmed cell death) enzymes that participate in DNA repair checkpoint-control proteins that arrest the cell cycle if DNA is damaged or chromosomes are abnormal intracellular proteins that regulate or inhi bit progression through a specific stage of the cell cycle receptors for secreted hormones that function to inhibit cell proliferation In contrast to proto-oncogenes, whose activ ation involves gain-of-function mutations, the conversion of tumour-suppressor genes into onc ogenes is due to loss-of-function mutations. Since generally one copy of a tumour-suppressor gene suffices to control cell proliferation, both alleles (gene copies) of a tumour-suppressor ge ne must be lost or in activated in order to promote tumour development. Thus, oncogenic loss-of-function mutations in tumour- suppressor genes act recessivel y. Tumour-suppressor genes in ma ny cancers have deletions or point mutations that prevent production of any protein or lead to production of a non- functional protein. Genetic studies of cancer-prone families led to the initial identifica tion of many tumour- suppressor genes. A classic case is retinoblasto ma, which is caused by loss of function of RB, the first tumour-suppressor gene to be identified (see table 1). The protein, which is encoded by RB helps to regulate progressi on through the cell cycle. Child ren with hereditary retino- blastoma develop retinal blastoma early in thei r life and generally in both eyes. Each tumour that develops is derived from a single cell.

As a rule, the chromosomal abnormalities are not the same in all tumours: each tu mour has its own set of anomalies. Human cells ordinarily have 23 pairs of chromosomes (t hey are diploid), rec- ognised by their well-defined substructure, but tu mour cells are usually aneuploid (i.e. they have an abnormal number of chromosomes \u2014 generally too many), a nd they often contain translocations (fused elements from different chromosomes). Cells with abnormal numbers of chromosomes form when the cell-division ch eckpoints are non-functional. Defects in these checkpoint controls are common in tumour cells; the molecular ba sis for these defects is in- creasingly being discovered. The p53 checkpoint control protein Although the protein p53, which wa s described for the first time in 1979, has several func- tions, its ability to ac t as a checkpoint-control protein wh ich arrests the cell cycle if DNA is damaged or chromosomes are abnormal is most relevant in respect to its tumour-suppressing function. p53 mutations occur in more th an 50% of human cancers. All p53 mutations seem to abolish its ability to bind to specific DNA sequences respectively to activate gene expres- sion. When, as a result of mutations, the p53 ch eckpoint control does not operate properly, damaged DNA is replicated, producing novel muta tions and further DNA rearrangements that in the end can lead to highly transformed, metast atic cells. The conseque nces of mutations in the p53 gene provide a dramatic example of the fundamental significance of cell-cycle checkpoint control for the health of a multicellular organism. Defects in DNA-repair systems a ssociated with certain cancers A link between carcinogenesis and the failure of DNA repair is suggested by the finding that humans with inherited genetic defects in certai n repair systems have an enormously increased probability of developing certain cancers. One such disease is xeroderma pigmentosum. IPOL/A/STOA/ST/2006-21 PE 383.215 IPOL/A/STOA/ST/2006-21 Page 17 of 46 PE 383.215 Individuals with this disease suffer from sk in cancers called melanomas and squamous cell carcinomas very easily if their skin is exposed to the UV rays in sunlight. Cells of affected patients are unable to repair UV damage or to remove chemical substituents on DNA bases. Such damage is commonly repaired by an exci sion-repair mechanism. The complexity of mammalian excision-repair systems is demonstrated by the fact that at least seven different genes lead to xeroderma pigmentosum le sions, all having the same consequences. Genes involved in apoptosis (telom erase expression and cancer cells) Telomeres, the physical ends of linear chromosomes, consist of tandem arrays of a short DNA sequence (TTAGGG in vertebrates, and thus also in human cells). While the double- stranded DNA cannot be completely replicated during cell divisi on until the end of the mole- cule, in the germ line and in rapidly dividing somatic cells (such as stem cells) an enzyme called telomerase adds the TTAGGG repeats to the ends of the chromosome. The absence of telomerase leads to the shortening of the telome res with each cell cycle. Complete loss of te- lomeres results in end-to-end chromosome fusions and finally the death of the cells. As most human somatic cells lack telomerase, the shorteni ng of telomeres is regarded as part of the programmed cell-death mechanisms. Most tumour cells, however, overcome this ba rrier by expressing telomerase. Many research- ers believe that telomerase expression is esse ntial for a tumour cell to become immortal, and specific inhibitors of telomerase have been s uggested as therapeutic agents against cancer. 4.4 Angiogenesis Tumours, whether primary or secondary, require the recruitment of ne w blood vessels in or- der to grow to a large mass. In the absence of a blood supply, a tumour can grow into a mass of about 106 cells, roughly a sphe re 2 mm in diameter. At this point, division of cells on the outside of the tumour mass is balanced by the d eath of those in the centre due to an inade- quate supply of nutrients. Unless they secrete hormones, such tumours cause few problems. However, most tumours induce the formation of new blood vessels (neovascularisation) that invade the tumour and nourish it. If this process is due to the protrusion of capillary buds and sprouts, which is typical for tumours, it is called angiogenesis. Although this complex proc- ess is not understood in detail, it can be divided into several disc rete steps: degradation of the basal lamina that surrounds a ne arby capillary, migration into the tumour of endothelial cells lining the capillary, division of these endothelial cells, and formation of a new basement membrane around the newly elongated capillary (Cao 2005). Cancers that lack angiogenesis remain dorma nt. The angiogenic tumour switch is activated when the balance shifts betw een angiogenic inhibitors and stimulators (Yance/Sagar 2006). In normal tissues, the process of neovascularisa tion is subtly controlled by a series of en- dogenous polypeptides that are secreted during growth, healing and tissue renewal. Many tu- mours produce growth factors th at stimulate angiogenesis dire ctly; other tumours somehow induce surrounding normal ce lls to synthesise and secrete such factors. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), tr ansforming growth factor (TGF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which are secreted by many tumours, all have angiogenic properties (Yance/Sagar 2006). One of the most mysterious aspects of angioge nesis is that a primary tumour will often se- crete a substance that inhibits angiogenesis ar ound secondary metastases. In this case, surgi- cal removal of the primary tumour may stimulate growth of its metastat ic secondary tumours. Several natural proteins that inhibit of the VEGF receptor have excited much in terest as therapeutic agents since they might be useful against many kinds of tumours. While new blood ve ssels are constantly forming during embryonic development, only few form nor mally in adults; thus angiogenesis inhibi- tors should have few adverse side effects. 4.5 Metastasis Metastatic cells lose contact w ith other cells in their tissue of origin and overcome the usual limitations to cell movement provided by basal la minae and other bodily structures. As a re- sult, metastatic cells can invade adjoining tissu e or enter the circulat ion and establish them- selves in distant parts of the body. The basal lamina (or basement membrane) is th e physical barrier which keeps cells separated. It underlies layers of ep ithelial cells (which form the outsi de coating of organs) and surrounds the endothelial cells of blood vesse ls (which form the inside co ating). Basal laminae also rep- resent the boundaries of different compartmen ts of the body. Tumour cells often produce and secrete molecules (enzymes) that trigger the di gestion of components (mostly proteins) of the basal laminae as a prerequisite for penetrating them. An important pathway is the release of so-called plasminogen activator, which cuts o ff a piece from the serum protein plasminogen, thereby converting it into the active protease (protein-digesting enzyme) plasmin. Secretion of a small amount activator causes a large incr ease in plasmin activity (a typical biochemical \"cascade effect\"). A striking analogy to invasion by tumour cells occurs in the extra-embryonic cells of th e foetus which also secrete pl asminogen activator in order to permit implantation in the uterine wall. When the basal lamina disintegra tes, tumour cells can enter the bloodstream, but fewer than 1 in 10 000 cells which escape the primary tumour survive to colonise another tissue and form a secondary, metastatic tumour. Such a cell must first adhere to an endothelial cell lining a capillary and migrate across or through it into the unde rlying tissue. To be able to metasta- sise, a tumour cell must be able to multiply an d adhere to distinct types of cells. The wide range of altered behaviours that underlie mali gnancy may have their basis in new or variant surface proteins made by malignant cells. 4.6 Cancer-causing viruses In terms of recent therapies for cancer, viruses as causative agents are of special relevance, because the so-called prophylactic vaccine therap ies are directed against them (section 7.1). Usually, therapies are used to treat cancer that has developed as a consequence of the pa- tient's exposure to carcinogens su ch as chemicals or radiation, regardless of their nature, and are in this respect unspecific. However, in the ca se of viruses, the carci nogen itself is the tar- get of the intervention, and thus th e therapy can be highly specific. IPOL/A/STOA/ST/2006-21 PE 383.215 IPOL/A/STOA/ST/2006-21 Page 19 of 46 PE 383.215 Several viruses are known to be carcinogenetic or to enhance th e onset of neoplasia, e.g.: human papillomavirus (HPV): cervical cancer hepatitis B (HBV a nd HCV): hepatocellular These viruses use different strategies to elic it tumour cells. In humans, DNA viruses are pre- dominant. The known oncogenes of DNA viruses ar e integral parts of the viral genome re- quired for viral replication. HPVs infect epithelial cells (the outside coa ting) and inactivate the central anti-oncogenes Rb and p53, a process which leads to benign warts. One-third of about 100 types are sexually transmitted. Some serotypes of the HPVs ( 16, 18, 31, 33 and 35) can cause cervical cancer. More than 80% of the world's cases of liver can cer (hepatocellular carcinoma) are attributable to infection by the hepatitis B and C viruses, and some 350 million people are chronically infected with one of the seven subtypes of HBV. HBV inactivates host anti-oncogenes by in- tegrating parts of its genome into the DNA of the liver cells. The co-infection of HHV-8 and HIV leads in immune-suppressed individuals to Kaposi\u00b4s sarcoma. HHV-8 infection alone does not cause cancer. But the combination with HIV that suppresses the immune system leads to the oncogenicity of endot helial cells. There are probably several genes involved. Two of th em encode for homologues of the human Bcl-2 and cyclin D genes that control the progression of cells through the cell-cycle. HTLV-1, a retrovirus, infects T cells and can cause leukaemia and lymphoma. It is spread by sharing syringes or needles used to inject dr ugs, through sexual contact, and from mother to child at birth or through breast-feeding. Helicobacter pylori , not a virus, but a bacterium which leads to gastric ulcer and sometimes to stomach cancer, shares some mechanisms w ith cancer-causing viruses. Its major cancer- causing protein CagA leads to the depolarisation and mobilisation of epithelial cells in the inner coating (mucosa) of the stomach and give s them the ability to move throughout the tis- sue. These modifications are regarded to be one origin of gastric cancer. New findings suggest that key- molecules could play an impor tant role in the common mo- lecular mechanisms of cancer, infections and infl ammatory diseases of epithelial cells or tis- These so-called meta-proteins (e.g., NOD2 and DMBT1) could turn out to be a central point in the treatment of cancer and other severe diseases. IPOL/A/STOA/ST/2006-21 PE 383.215 IPOL/A/STOA/ST/2006-21 Page 20 of 46 PE 383.215 4.7 The stem cell paradigm (or hypothesis) The stem cell paradigm originates from devel opmental biology and oncology. It suggests that cancer develops as a result of mutations of adu lt stem cells (Serakinci, expert opinion). The cells are the origin of other subcomponent cells of the tumour and reta in key properties of stem cells. Furthermore, cancer relapse and metastasis are also caused by these cells. The stem cell paradigm does not interfere with earlier concepts of carcinogenesis, e.g. the \"multi-hit model\". It just points to adult stem cel ls as the site where the process starts (Oliv- era et al. 2002). Cancerous stem cells were first identified in 1997 when John Dick's research group from the University of Toronto transfe rred a few blood stem cells from human leukaemia patients into mice and observed leukaemia develop in them. In 2003, Michael Clarke succeeded in finding cancer stem cells in breast tumours. The major- ity of the cells were incapable of further growth , but a handful were able to seed new cancer cells and maintained thei r ability to proliferate and to generate mature cells. In 2004, cancer stem cells were additionally detected in human brain tumours and bone cancer (Serakinci, expert opinion). Like normal stem cells, tumour stem cells exist in very low numbers, but they can replicate to give a multitude of cells. Unlike normal stem cells, however, cancerous stem cells lack the controls which tell them when to stop divi ding. Traditional chemotherapy kills off the major- ity of the tumour cells, but if any of the cancerous stem cells survive the treatment, the cancer may return. The stem cell paradigm (or hypothes is) has fundamental implications for cancer risk assessment, early detecti on, prognosis, and prevention (Serakinci, expert opinion). Fur- thermore, the cancer therapies currently used ai m at killing differentiated tumour cells while sparing the rare cancer stem cells population. Research into the differences in gene expres sion between normal and tumour stem cells may lead to the development of new treatments targ eting the root of the problem \u2014 the cancer stem cell itself. If the stem cell paradigm (hypothesis) is right, it is evident that a cancer treatment which fails to eliminate the cancer stem cells will probably allow the reappearance of the tumour. Even if 99.9 % of the tumour cells are destroyed by surger y plus chemo- and/or radiotherapy, the re- maining \"silent\" cancer stem cells can lead to a relapse after some time. To prevent this, spe- cific strategies for targeting those cancer stem cells have to be developed (Li et al. 2007). The new biomedical approaches like gene, vaccin e, and immunotherapy probably represent the most rational and perhaps the most promising attempts. 4.8 A remark on the distinction betwee n gene, vaccine and immunotherapy It is very difficult to distinguish between gene, vaccine and anti body or immunotherapy with regard to their therapeutic mechanisms. All of the new cancer therapy approaches are linked by the scientific finding that cancer is a di sease resulting from the accumulation of genetic modifications within a cell. The basic attempt in delineating new therapy strategies is to de- termine as many properties of cancer (stem) cells as possible and outline an effective bio- medical action against them. In many cases, gene transfer is used to deliver pharmaceutically active compounds such as (monoclonal) antibodies or signalling molecules to the tumour site in order to activate the immune system, wh ich can then fight the cancerous cells. IPOL/A/STOA/ST/2006-21 PE 383.215 IPOL/A/STOA/ST/2006-21 Page 21 of 46 PE 383.215 The different terms must be considered not as clear-cut methods, but as basic strategies or concepts that often follow the same paths and use the same tools. Most approaches aim to fight cancer from more than one direction. On the one hand, they alter the genes of targeted cells, thus, e.g., causing apoptosis, while at the sa me time healthy immune cells are trained to fight against potential remissions by identify ing new developing cancer cells and killing them. Depending on the definition of \"gene therapy\" us ed, one may include very different therapeu- tic approaches such as the inse rtion of suicide genes into tu mour cells or using anti-sense technology to shut down genes or parts of genes in cancer cells (see th e following section). Particularly with regard to the term \"stem cell therapy\", one must take into account that it is used in different contexts: on the one hand to de note the use of stem cells as specially suited and in some cases highly specific vectors (as is shown in the following section), on the other hand to indicate the need to target stem cells dur ing therapy due to their potentially lethal ef- fects in terms of the stem cell paradigm (described above). As already mentioned in the in troduction, due to the very rare examples of exploring stem cells as therapeutic tools against cancer, we deci ded not to classify stem cell therapy as a dis- tinct category but as part of gene therapy approaches.

Gene therapy In general, gene therapy can be defined as a se t of approaches involvi ng the transfer of ge- netic information to cells, tissues or organs of a patient in or der to overcome a genetic defect or to provide a protective function. Fig. 7: Distribution of gene therapy approache s by clinical indication (worldwide) in 2000 Gene Therapy by clinical Induction Others 6% Cancers 67%Infectious Diseases 8% Cardiovascular 9% Single Gene Disorder 10% Source: NIH RAC database (N ational Institutes of Health Recombinant DNA Advi- sory Committee, 2000) (http://www4.od.nih.gov/oba/RAC/GeM CRIS/GeMCRIS_public.htm) Data from the National Institutes of Health Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee database (NIH RAC) for the year 2000 show that cancer was at that time the disease most frequently targeted by gene therapy (figure 7; more recen t data were not found). Of the 350 gene therapy clinical trials, 67 % were directed towards cancer. 5.1 Approaches/Protocols There are a number of different approaches an d protocols. Some approaches target cancer cells in order to destroy them or prevent their growth, other approaches target healthy cells to enhance their ability to fight cancer. A \"normal\", functional gene can be inserted into the genome to re place a non-functional, cancer-causing gene. This is the most common approach at present. Other gene therapies attempt to stimulate th e body's natural ability to attack cancer cells; some involve the development of enzymes that destroy viral or cancerous genetic material within cells. In some studies, genes were injected into cancer cells to make them more sensitive to chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or other treatm ents. In other protoc ols, genes are incor- porated into healthy blood-forming stem cells to make these more resistant to the side ef- fects of high doses of anti-cancer drugs. IPOL/A/STOA/ST/2006-21 PE 383.215 IPOL/A/STOA/ST/2006-21 Page 23 of 46 PE 383.215 In a further approach, cancer cells are injected with genes that can be used to destroy them. In this protocol, \"suicide genes\" are in troduced into cancer cells. Later, a pro-drug (an inactive form of a toxic dr ug) is given to the patient. Th e pro-drug is then activated only in the cancer cells containi ng the \"suicide genes,\" which leads to the destruction of the cancer cells. Additional research focuses on the use of gene therapy to prevent carcinoma from devel- oping new blood vessels (angiogenesis). Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and insulin growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) are widely recognised as validated cancer therapy ta rgets, although perturba tion of the activity of the protein's function through traditional chemical techniques appears to be quite challenging (see also section 2.1). With reference to the ca ncer gene therapies in figure 7, 31 % used in vitro immunotherapies, 32 % used in vivo immunotherapies and 15 % were based on pro- drug suicide therapies. 5.2 Vectors for gene therapie s: properties and problems A gene cannot be inserted directly into a person 's cell, instead the therapeutic genes have to be delivered into the cells, ti ssues, or organs by biochemical delivery systems (\"vectors\" or \"shuttles\") such as viruses, liposomes or (r eceptor) proteins, which display different charac- teristics (table 2). A further differentiation is made concerning the place/site of the genetic alteration: in vivo or ex vivo. In some clinical trials, cells from the patient's blood or bone marrow are removed and grown in the laboratory. Th e cells are exposed to a virus that is car- rying the desired gene. The virus enters the cells and inserts the desired gene into the cells' DNA. The cells are grown in the laboratory and are then reintr oduced into the patient's body by injection into a vein. This type of gene therapy is called ex vivo because the gene is trans- ferred into specimens of the patient's cells grown outside his body. In other approaches, vec- tors (often viruses) or liposomes (fatty particle s) are used to deliver th e desired gene directly to cells in the patient's body. This form of gene therapy is called in vivo. Many gene therapy clinical trials rely on retroviruses to deli ver the desired gene. Other vi- ruses used as vectors include adenoviruses, adeno-associat ed viruses, lentiviruses, pox- viruses, and herpes viruses. These viruses diffe r in how well they transfer the genes to cells, which cells they can recognise and infect, and whether they alter the cell's DNA temporarily or permanently. Thus, different vectors have to be tested, depending on the specific require- ments of the study. IPOL/A/STOA/ST/2006-21 PE 383.215 IPOL/A/STOA/ST/2006-21 Page 24 of 46 PE 383.215 Table 2: Characteristics of the most commo n gene delivery systems for gene therapy Viral systems Non-viral systems System Adenovirus Adeno- Double- stranded DNA Single-stranded DNA RNA DNA DNA Target cells Replicating and non- replicating cells Replicating an d non-replicating cells Replicating cells Cells expressing specific recep- tors Replicating and non- replicating cells Chromosomal DNA integra-tion No Yes, usually at a specific site on chromosome 19 Yes, random Rare event Rare event Efficienc y of transduction > 90% > 90% < 30% Low Low Induction o f host immu- nity towards the vector Yes Yes Yes No No Gene expres- sion Transient transfection Long term ex- pression Stable trans- fection Transient Transient Safet y for the host Possibility o f recombina- tion with ubiquitous wild-type vi- rus May cause changes in f insertion mutagene- sis/oncogene sis Safe Safe Source: Fogar et al. 2005 The different characteristics of the vector sy stems can be advantages or disadvantages, strengths or weaknesses, dependi ng on their use. In many cases, th e efficiency of transduction is not sufficient for therapeutic measures, or an activation of the immune system cannot be achieved. One important parameter is whether the genetic alteration has to be lasting or tem- porary (stable or transient transfection). Of overall importance is the ques tion of biological sa fety, which means that the vector itself does not create a novel threat to the patient's he alth. Because viruses can usually infect more than one type of cell, gene therapy is always accompanied by substantial risks. Especially in the case of modified retroviruses, which are pa rtly derived from highly infectious pathogens, it is absolutely impe rative to avoid disintegration a nd spreading of the viral DNA. IPOL/A/STOA/ST/2006-21 PE 383.215 IPOL/A/STOA/ST/2006-21 Page 25 of 46 PE 383.215 Other concerns include the possibility that tr ansferred genes can be \"overexpressed\", produc- ing so much of the missing protein as to be ha rmful, or that the viral vector could cause inflammation or an immune reaction, or also th at the virus could be transmitted from the pa- tient to other individuals or into the environment. Another danger arises if the new gene is inse rted at the wrong location in the DNA, eventu- ally causing cancer by itself or ot her harmful mutations to the DNA. In the last 10-15 years tremendous progress ha s been made concerning the understanding of gene therapy approaches. Scientists have lear ned which genes or combinations of genes are of interest for their research, they have found and altered diffe rent kinds of delivery systems to fit different tissues and cell types, but they have also realised that it is very difficult to cure cancer using this approach. The c hoice of the vector system to ta rget the desired cells or tis- sues has particularly proved to be one of the main challenges in planning effective (cancer) gene therapy. 5.3 Examples of approaches with adenovirus-based vector systems In the past few years, evidence has grown that adenoviral-mediated gene transfer has particu- larly great potential, although the high immunogeni city of adenoviral vect ors is still one of the obstacles. The properties of adenoviral transfer systems enab le researchers to use the vi- rus as a promising transfer tool for cancer gene therapy in order to target cancer cells and, additionally, for genetic immunisation to c ontrol the host immune response (Romano 2006). One approach that uses adenovi ral vectors destroys the replic ation program of tumour cells by using the oncolytic capacities of the virus (O 'Shea 2005). It seems that early viral proteins which are necessary for the development of ad enoviruses elicit growth deregulation in in- fected cells similar to that e ngendered by mutations in tumour cells. Researchers believe that this knowledge could be of importance both for the discovery of novel tumour targets as well as for the design of oncolytic vi ruses and combination therapies. A relatively new approach using the advantages of viral therapy in combination with gene therapy is the so-called \"targe ting gene-virotherapy\" of cance r (Liu/Gu 2006): The new ther- apy was tested in mice and had a stronger anti-tum our effect than either gene or viral therapy alone. Two genes with compensative or synergistic effects were inserted into a virus system (ZD55) and administered alone or in combin ation. As a result, xenograft tumour masses (transplanted from human tumours) in mice we re completely eliminated. The chosen genes were a tumour suppressor gene and granuloc yte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM- CSF), a gene that enhances the imm unological reactions of cancer patients. Pancreatic cancer, which possesses the potential for strong growth and metastasis, shows only limited response to conventional th erapies such as chemotherapy and/or radiation. At present a chemotherapeutic agent called gemcitabine (GEM) is used as first-line treatment. It inter- acts directly with DNA and inhibits the proliferation of pancreatic cancer ce lls. Nevertheless, the survival benefit of GEM for advanced pa ncreatic cancer remains limited. Studies in nude mice showed that the combination of Ad-NK4 (adenovirus and a synthetic hepatocyte growth factor antagonist) and GEM inhi bit three steps of tumour grow th, namely, metastasis, angio- genesis, proliferation and i nvasion. As a result, this combination therapy suppressed both peritoneal dissemination and liver metastasis and resulted in prolonged survival (Ogura et al. 2006).

The current limitation to effective ODN and siRNA th erapy is the efficient and specific delivery in vivo. Companies around the world are de veloping specific delivery vehicles and mechanisms in- cluding liposomes, viruses and cell-penetrating peptides for siRNA and ODN, because it is believed that, if efficient delivery is achieved, a whole range of new gene-silencing therapies will become available for any number of diseas es (Hiroi et al. 2006; Orr/Dorr 2005; Zhang et al. 2006). Antisense therapy is strictly sp eaking not a form of gene therapy, but is often connected to a \"true\" gene therapy. When the genetic sequence of a particular gene is known to be causative of a particular disease, it is possible to synthesise DNA th at will bind to the messenger RNA produced by that gene, effectively switching th e gene \"off\". This synt hesised nucleic acid is called an \"anti-sense\" ODN, because its base sequence is complementary to the gene's mes- senger RNA, which is called the \"sense\" se quence. A sense segment of mRNA is thus blocked by the antisense mRNA segment (Zhang et al. 2006). There are a lot of genes that are well-char acterised (e.g. tumour s uppressor genes, proto- oncogenes and regulatory genes) and are now targets of antisense therapy approaches. Some of them have reached the status of clin ical trials, for example (Orr/Dorr 2005): p53, a tumour suppressor gene (see section 2.2) which is responsive to elements of cellu- lar stress and involved in DNA re pair and apoptosis. In a phas e I clinical study with pa- tients with acute myelogenous leukaemia (a fast-growing cancer of the blood and the bone marrow), no significant toxicity was observed, and a favourable pharmacokinetic profile of P-ODNs (phosphorathioate ODNs) admi The c-Myb proto-oncogene encodes a transcripti on factor that is downregulated during differentiation of hematopoie tic cells and commonly upregul ated in leukaemias. An- tisense ODNs were administered by continuous infusion in a clinical phase I study. As a result, no drug-related toxicity was observed, and some disease stabilisation could be demonstrated. The Bcl-2 protein is a member of a family of proteins that reside within the mitochondrial membrane and are key regulators of program med cell death, morphologically character- ised as apoptosis (see section 2.1). Bcl-2 is an antiapoptotic protein, and overexpression may be linked to tumourigenesis and chemoresis tance. In a prostate cancer phase II study an antisense drug (Genasense) is used alon e and in combination first-line thera- peutic agents like paclitaxel, mitoxantrone and docetaxel. 5.5 Stem cell therapy Quite frequently, stem cell therapy is referred to as a distinct and fully introduced therapy ap- proach on its own. A closer look at respectiv e publications does not support this view. It rather seems that the use of altered stem cells as an anticancer therapy is at a very early stage (Serakinci, expert opinion). S ubsequently, only very few public ations dealing with these ap- proaches are available. IPOL/A/STOA/ST/2006-21 PE 383.215 IPOL/A/STOA/ST/2006-21 Page 27 of 46 PE 383.215 In one very recent approach, stem cells are us ed as shuttles for delivering drugs to cancers which have already spread throughout the body (metastasis). The researchers use modified neural stem cells to activate and concentrat e chemotherapeutic drugs predominantly at the tumour sites, so that tissue both surrounding th e tumour and throughout the rest of the body remains unharmed. This two-part system has been developed to infiltra te metastatic tumour sites first and to activate a chemotherapeutic drug later, thereby localising the drug\u00b4s effect to the tumour cells. This technique takes advantag e of the tendency of invasive tumours to at- tract neural stem cells. Modified neural stem cells were injected into immunosuppressed mice with artificially in- duced neuroblastoma tumours. After waiting a few days to allow the stem cells to migrate to the tumours, a precursor drug was administered which interacted with an enzyme expressed by the stem cells once it reached them, converting it into an active drug able to kill surround- ing tumour cells. As a result, all of the neurobl astoma mice appeared to be healthy and were tumour-free after 6 months. Wit hout treatment all of the neurobl astoma mice died within 2.5 months. These were the first research results to demons trate the efficacy of simultaneously targeting multiple solid tumour sites spread throughout th e body in the metastatic stage of cancer. It can be speculated that the technique could also be used for other malignant solid tumours, including colon, brain, prostate and breast cancer. Future pre-cl inical trials (animal studies) are planned (Aboody et al. 2006). 5.6 Vanguard approaches Besides those listed in table 2, there are further a nd novel delivery systems for the introduc- tion of genetic material into ce lls or tissues. The ro le of nanotechnology in gene therapy of cancer increases from year to year. Nanoparticles have been used e.g. for p53 the gene ther- apy of cancer, and an intravenous nanoparticle formulation of the tumour suppressor gene FUS1 has been tested in experimental animal s. Examples of other techniques are integrin- targeted nanoparticles for site -specific delivery and so-called immunolipoplex formulations which are combinations of (organic) lipid vesi cles and biological molecules such as antibod- ies or receptors (Fukumori/I chikawa 2006; Jain 2005). New developments of inorganic nanoparticles that interact with biological systems show the entry of new technologies in anticancer treatment. Among inorganic materials, magnetite has been investigated most widely for anticancer ther apy. It was earlier used in the hyper thermia treatment of cancer (Ito et al. 2003; Zhang et al. 2002). IPOL/A/STOA/ST/2006-21 PE 383.215 of 46 PE \"Passive\" immunotherapy: antibody therapy In many solid tumours, the response to chemot herapy, radiotherapy and/or surgery is limited, which means that additional stra tegies used in combination w ith these \"conventional\" thera- pies play an important role in achieving success. Since resear chers found that antigens on the surface of tumour cells are cell- specific (tumour-associated antigens, TAAs) and differ from those of \"normal\" cells, immunotherapies have increasingly become the focus of interest. The term \"immunotherapy\" usually co vers (a) approaches which us e activation of the patient's own immune cells (e.g. T cells or dendritic cells) to eliminat e cancer cells and which are of- ten referred to as vaccine therapies (or \"ac tive\" immunotherapy, see section 7), and (b) all kinds of strategies to specifically adjust (extra-corporally) individual types of immune mole- cules or cells in order to use them as a can cer drug or treatment (\"passive immunotherapy). Researchers manipulate T cells, for instance, and try to make them tumour-specific. In so do- ing, selection of the targeted antigen is of major importance. The majority of TAAs are anti- gens which are overexpressed on tumour cells pr esent on \"normal\" cells. Engi- neered T-cell therapy is still in its infancy, although the ap proach is being tested in early- phase clinical trials (Mansoor et al. 2005). In the follo wing section, we focus on antibody therapy as a prominent example of biological ther apy because it can be used in different ap- proaches and for different purposes. Antibodies for targeted cancer therapy The detrimental disadvantage of traditional anti-can cer agents is their toxi city to normal cells which limits the success of therapy. Growing unde rstanding of the differences between ma- lignant and normal cells leads to new anti-cancer agents targeted directly at cells associated with malignant alterations, such as increased proliferation, impaired apoptosis or angiogene- sis. Engineered antibodies can address TAAs a nd can be used to inhibit cell growth, induce apoptosis or to serve as target-reagent of drug-delivery systems (Zangemeister-Wittke 2005). Antibodies are a potent tool fo r use as therapeutic agents in various pathological conditions, with a specific focus on cancer. Recently de veloped technologies (e.g. recombinant technol- ogy, humanisation of antibodies, th e production and selection of monoclonal antibodies) have achieved two important goals, namely, to overco me most host anti-antib ody responses and to extend the half-life of the reagent. These new findings and techniques now permit an tibodies to be set up in broad spectra as anticancer tools. Monoclonal antibodies are utilised as blocking agents against, e.g. angio- genic growth factors and their receptors (Sanz/ Alvarez-Vallina 2005). The main strategies for inhibiting the neovascularisation of tumours in clude: blocking growth-f actor activity, matrix proteases, directly ta rgeting endothelial cells, targe ting and/or blocking extracellu- lar membrane activity sites, and up-regulating endogenous inhibitors. The best-known example of successful immunot herapy against early breast cancer is a mAb called trastuzumab (Herceptin\u00ae). Th is antibody is considered to be one of the first biological therapies that cures (a specific kind of br east) cancer (Untch, expert opinion). Herceptin\u00ae acts as an anti-angiogenic cocktail and addre sses not only the human cell surface receptor HER2, but also other anti-angi ogenic molecules (R\u00fcckert 2005). Another emerging alternative using antibodies in anticancer therapy is the construction of dual-targeting bispecific (monoclonal) antibodies (BsAbs). BsAbs are derived from the re- combination of variable domains of two different antibodies with different specificities. They are thus capable of binding to both antigens of their parental antibodies and targeting two TAAs at once. IPOL/A/STOA/ST/2006-21 PE 383.215 IPOL/A/STOA/ST/2006-21 Page 29 of 46 PE 383.215 In cell culture experiments, antibodies which interfere with both EGFR and HER2 (receptor tyrosine kinases) showed an additive result and inhibited cancer ce ll growth from 35% and 55% (as single agents) to 80%. These data suggest that combination therapy c ould be useful in cance rs caused by the mis- regulation of receptor tyrosine kinases (Marvin/Zhu 2006). An approach using antibodies in combination with radiotherapy is the (boron) neutron cap- ture therapy. This therapy a pproach requires the introduction of relatively high doses of boron (10B, a chemical element) into tumour cells or tu mour vasculature. The effect of this stable isotope is the breakage of DNA strands, causing (tumour) ce ll growth to stop. A therapy ap- proach targeted at cancer cells could reduce un wanted side effects as well as toxicity. Re- searchers have composed liposomal vesicles in to which lipophilic drugs can be incorporated. They modified the surface with polymers (e.g. to shield them from recognition by the im- mune system) and coupled monoclonal antibodies to the liposome to ta rget EGFR. This for- mulation was applied to human ovarian carcino ma cells and endothelia l cells, leading to a significant quantity of 10B within the cells. The combinati on of monoclonal antibodies to tar- get cancer cell receptors and direct treatment with a stable isotope could become an attractive approach for cancer thera py (Krijger et al. 2005). Another molecular target in tumour therapy is midkine. Midkine is a heparin-binding growth factor which promotes the growth, survival, diff erentiation and migratio n of various cells. It also enhances the fibrinolytic activity of endothelial cells, exhibi ts angiogenic activity through cellular interactions, and is frequently overexpresse d in human carcinomas. Re- searchers produced an antibody (against the mi dkine receptor) conjugated with doxorubicin (DOX), a compound used in chemotherapy which stops the process of replicating DNA) and were successful in inhibiting the growth of liv er cancer cell cultures (HepG2) by internalising conjugated antibodies. This raises the possi bility of using anti-midkine antibody conjugated with DOX for cancer ther apy (Inoh et al. 2006). These examples show that antibodies are potent tools, either alone or in combination with other therapies as potential (and already existing, e.g. Hercep tin\u00ae) approaches to cancer. IPOL/A/STOA/ST/2006-21 PE 46 PE 383.215 7. \"Active\" immunotherapy: vaccine therapy There are many different targets that could be addressed either with prophylactic or with therapeutic cancer vaccines. Preventive or prophyl actic cancer vaccines are designed to target cancer-causing viruses and prevent viral- or bact erial-borne infections. They are administered to healthy individuals. The inte ntion of therapeutic cancer v accine approaches, on the other hand, is to alter or sup port elements of the immune system to fight the disease (also called \"active immunotherapy\", see section 6). 7.1 Preventive or prophylactic vaccines One-fifth of cancer cases worl dwide (WHO 2006) are due to chronic infections, mainly HBV (causing liver cancer), HPV (causing cervical cancer), HIV (causing Kaposi's sarcoma and lymphomas) and Helicobacter pylori (causing stomach cancer) (see section 2.7). In 2006, the FDA approved two preventive vaccin es directed towards infection with HPV, which causes almost all cervical cancers in women. The HPV vaccines from the pharmaceu- tical companies Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline ar e genetically engineered vaccines and use very similar approaches. The so-called \"virus- like-particle\" vaccines are mainly constructed of envelope and viral surface proteins and are unable to proliferate, because all essential genes for virus replication have been removed. The two vaccines are effective against about 70% of cases of cervical cancer worldwide, Gardasil\u00ae from Sanofi against the subtypes HPV-6, 11, the subtypes HPV-16 and HPV-18 (U.S. National Cancer Institute, Ca ncer Vaccine Fact Sheet). The FDA approval of Cervarix is still pending and is expected fo r the end of 2007. Both vaccines are aimed at young girls aged between 9 and 16 y ears before they have their first sexual contacts. Young boys should also be vaccinated, so they will not spread the viruses. As HBV causes liver cancer, anti-HBV vaccines ha ve a prophylactic effect against this kind of cancer. However, since HBV itself is a severe disease, cancer prevention here represents rather a side effect of HBV vaccination. Prophylactic vaccination against human cancer provides a unique opportunity to prevent hu- man suffering for individuals at risk for tum our development. Appropriate vaccines may pose slightly different requirements than vaccines intended for therapeutic use. Prophylactic vac- cines will need to prevent tumours far in the future, emphasising the need to establish solid tumour-specific immunological memory (Riemer et al. 2005). 7.2 Therapeutic vaccines (\"active\" immunotherapy) A broad variety of molecules in the human immune system are considered to be effective tar- gets for therapeutic anti-cancer vaccines, from single molecules up to whole cells. In most trials therapeutic vaccines are used to activat e the immune system of cancer patients to pre- vent reappearance. Vaccines used to treat cance rs take advantage of the fact that certain molecules on the surface of cancer cells are eith er unique or more abundant than those found on normal, non-cancerous cells. These molecules, either proteins or ca rbohydrates, act as an- tigens, meaning that they can stimulate the im mune system to make a specific immune re- sponse. Researchers hope that, when a vaccine c ontaining cancer-specific antigens is injected into a patient, these antigens will stimulate th e immune system to att ack cancer cells without harming normal cells (U.S. National Cancer Institute, Cancer Vaccine Fact Sheet; http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopi cs/factsheet/cancervaccine). PE 383.215 Two schools of thought dominate the research in to tumour antigens and tumour vaccines. The first believes that tumour rejection can be obtained only by immunisation with unique tu- mour-associated antigens (TAAs) (Olivera et al. 2002), supporting the use of undefined tu- mour-derived material that would contain such antigens as tumour vaccines. This theory as- sumes that every tumour shares all the criteria from all other tumours, independent of their origin. Other researchers believe that every tumour has its own TA A configuration, depend- ing on the combination of tumour cell subtypes. Vaccination with purified TAAs was reported to suppress chemically induced mammary tu- mours in rats (van der Most et al. 2006), while vaccination with p53 protein prevented chemically induced skin cancer in mice. In hum ans, shared antigens appear to be the pre- dominant targets of tumour-specific immunity (Wang 2006). Animal studies have shown that cancer vaccines are most effective in preventing tumour oc- currence in genetically predispos ed individuals or after solid tumour removal. Therapeutic vaccination aims to activate the patient's ow n immune system via cancer cell recognition by T cells, which are capable of killing cancer ce lls and leaving normal cells unharmed. The mo- lecular targets recognised, which derive from pr oteins present in the cancer cell, encompass structures that are potentially a pplicable in anti-cancer vaccina tion strategies. In contrast to this, vaccines have until now show n only very limited potential in curing established cancer. 7.3 Adjuvants Typically, preventive as well as therapeutic vacc ines will be injected into the patients in combination with immunostimulating agents, called adjuvants. Adjuvants stimulate the im- mune response, enhance the vacc ine's effect and induce either antibodies or memory cells that are activated in case of a second infection. There are several adjuvants which use different st rategies to boost the vaccine. Adjuvants are an important issue for vaccine research in orde r to improve the benefit that can be gained from vaccines. Examples of commonly used ad juvants are (U.S. National Cancer Institute, Cancer Vaccine Fact cer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/cancervaccine): Keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) is a prot ein made by a shelled marine animal found along the coast of California and Mexico know n as a keyhole limpet. KLH is a large pro- tein that both causes an immune response and acts as a carr ier for cancer cell antigens. Cancer antigens often are relatively small prot eins that may be invisible to the immune system. KLH provides additional recognition s ites for immune cells known as T-helper cells and may increase activ ation of other immune cells known as cytotoxic T- lymphocytes. Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) is an inactivated form of the tuberculosis bacterium. BCG is added to some cancer vaccines in th e hope that it will boost the immune response to the vaccine antigen. It is not well underst ood why BCG may be espe cially effective for eliciting an immune response. However, BCG has been used for decades with other vac- cines, including the va ccine for tuberculosis. Interleukin- 2 (IL-2) is a pr otein made by the body's immune system that may boost the cancer-killing abilities of certain specialised immune system cells called natural killer cells. Although it can activate the immune system , many researchers believe IL-2 alone is not potent enough to prevent cance r relapse. Several cancer va ccines use IL-2 to boost immune response to specific cancer antigens. IPOL/A/STOA/ST/2006-21 PE 383.215 IPOL/A/STOA/ST/2006-21 Page 32 of 46 PE Bacterial DNA is recognised by the mammalian or ganism as foreign due to its different methylation pattern; this leads to activation of the immune system. Nucleotide sequences with non-methylated CG motifs (CpG-ODNs) and thus high similarity to bacterial DNA possess an immuno-modulatory potency and can serve as a \"danger signal\" in the im- mune system. CpG stands for cytosine and guanine separated by a phosphate. In verte- brates (e.g. humans), the CpG content of DNA is much lower than in invertebrates (less than 1000 fold). Modified CpG-ODNs are able to induce either a humoral or a cellular immune response (Wittig, expert opinion). 7.4 Clinical trials Hundreds of clinical trials of cancer vaccines are currently be ing carried out in patients who already have cancer. The International Committ ee of Medical Journal Editors has decided that all clinical trials should be entered in a public registry before the start of patient enrol- ment as a prerequisite for later publication. As a result, clinical trials are registered on a web- site (http://clinicaltrials.gov) established by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (Svane/Straten, expert opinion). In January 2007, 211 ongoing clinical ca ncer vaccine trials (phase I-III) were registered at the NI H database, 42 of these in phase III. Almost all trials (90%) use combinations of immune-stimulating agents or molecules (e.g. cytokines, synthetic peptides) an d modified cells of the patients (e.g. antigen-presenting cells, APCs, or dendritic cells). Some vaccine trials ar e using modified viruses such as vaccinia vi- ruses, adenoviruses or fowlpox virus (6%). The combination of either chemo- or radiation therapy with immuno-stimulating agents was f ound in 25% of the trials. Monoclonal antibod- ies and chemotherapeutic agents or transfected cells were used in another 25% of all listed trials. GM-CSF (granulocyte-macrophage colony-s timulating factor) is considered as a very promising immuno-stimulating agent and wa s used in 32% of all vaccine trials. During the past decades, a large number of phase II cancer vaccine st udies on a variety of cancer types have been published, several of th em with encouraging results. The number of following phase III studies is significantly lower, and only a few lived up to expectations. However, some either therapeutic, adjuvant or prophylactic cancer vaccines have actually achieved significant positive clinical re sults (Svane/Strate n, expert opinion). 7.5 Therapeutic versus prophy lactic cancer vaccines Prophylactic vaccines which protect against infectious diseases are a well-established, suc- cessful feature of modern medicine and have also proved successful in cancer prevention; two vaccines - that protect against liver cancer and cervical cancer - have been approved by the FDA and are available on the market. In c ontrast, the efficacy of therapeutic vaccines against established cancers still has to be proved. The two crucial differences between pro- phylactic microbial vaccines and therapeutic can cer vaccines are (Svane/Straten, expert opin- ion): 1. Prophylactic microbial vaccines are given prior to infection in order to prevent the in- fectious disease, while therapeutic cancer vaccines are given after emergence of the can- cer in order to combat tumours already present. 2. Although cancer cells are i ndeed recognised by the immune system, the response is weak compared to anti-infectious responses. In pa rt this is due to the fact that cancer cells are of \"self\" origin, i.e. are the result of a stepwise transformation of normal cells. IPOL/A/STOA/ST/2006-21 PE 383.215 IPOL/A/STOA/ST/2006-21 Page of 46 PE 383.215 Thus, the HPV and HBV vaccines against cervical cancer and liver cancer are in fact not di- rected against the cancer cells themselves, but rather against the causa tive agent of the devel- opment of the cancer. The significa nt differences between prophylactic versus therapeutic and anti-viral versus anti-cancer vaccinations im ply that not a ll of the knowledge and experi- ence with prophylactic microbial vaccines can be converted directly into the development of therapeutic cancer vaccines. Consequently, this specialised vaccine concep t necessitates a substantial and persisting re- search effort to become an effective new treatment modality in cancer therapy (Svane/Straten, expert opinion). Considering therapeutic vaccination against s pontaneous cancers, several important findings over the past decade point to an implementati on of vaccination regiments in clinical oncol- ogy. Firstly, the immune system possesses th e unique capacity of di stinguishing between cancer and normal cells. Although still in its infa ncy, data from numerous phase I and II trials - in addition to a limited numbe r of phase III trials - strongl y suggest that biological re- sponses are inducible and that vacci nation, in particular in an ad juvant setting or in patients with limited disease, will have a clinical imp act. With regard to poten tial synergies with con- ventional therapies, the lack of specific tumour cell targeting remains to be one of the major drawbacks of chemotherapy. In particular si nce the dogma of the in compatibility between vaccination and more conventional treatments such as chemotherapy has been challenged, we expect considerable progress to be made in the development and efficacy of therapeutic vac- cination against cancer, either alone or in co mbination with conventi onal therapie s. It is worth noting that the main big pharmaceutical comp anies are engaged in one or more clinical immunotherapy trials in cancer; a trend that has increased over the past few years in particu- lar. The time frame for the FDA's/EMEA's appr oval of the first product for the treatment of spontaneous cancer based on therapeutic vaccinati ons is estimated to be in the range of 3-5 years (Svane/Straten, expert opinion). IPOL/A/STOA/ST/2006-21 PE 383.215 IPOL/A/STOA/ST/2006-21 Page PE Therapeutic approaches in compar ison: alternatives or synergies? At this stage of research, it seems difficult to estimate the success of the different gene thera- pies and of the \"passive\" and \"active\" anti -cancer immunotherapies. An immune response has a potentially long-term clinical impact on the course of the disease by stabilising the condi- tion and thus prolonging survival rather than by performing massive tumour elimination. The most likely patients to benefit are, therefore, those with minor tumour burden or patients who have had their tumour surgically removed but w ho have a high risk of relapse. In these cate- gories of patients, disease stabil isation, frequency of relapse, time-span to relapse and length of survival are the most rational parameters for evaluating cancer vaccine effectiveness (Svane/Straten, expert opinion). The most unambiguous results, or the greatest actual medical relevance, are achieved by the preventive vaccine approach (directed toward s \"transmissible\", virus-related cancers), and by immunotherapies using monoclona l antibodies such as trastuzumab (Herceptin\u00ae), which is a very good example of research results being dir ectly applied to patients (Untch, expert opin- ion). Almost all approaches focus on aiming at severa l and different targets in the patient's body. The altering of cancer cells (inside or outside the body, conn ected with delivery via gene therapy) and of cancer-specific targets in combination with activation or support of the pa- tient's own immune system seems to yield a prom ising treatment. Nevertheless, it is still not fully understood which components (T cells, AP Cs, oncogenes, tumour suppressor genes, etc.) of the immune system are best addr essed in vaccine and immuno-approaches. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy are two e ssential cancer treatment options; it would, therefore, seem obvious to assess cancer vaccines in combination with these interventions. It was previously thought that chemotherapy would be disadvantageous when applied together with a cancer vaccine due to its immunosuppressive properties. However, it is becoming ap- parent that chemotherapy may actually have some beneficial properties as it can reduce regu- latory immune (T cell) activity that otherwise inhibits the anti-cancer immune response acti- vated by the cancer vaccine. It is possible th at an optimised chemotherapy regimen may be able to suppress this undesired inhibitory activity withou t incurring pronoun ced adverse ef- fects. Furthermore, cancer cell killing perfor med by chemotherapeutic agents may also en- hance vaccination strategies by releasing ne w molecular immune targets from the tumour cells (Svane/Straten, expert opinion). Radiot herapy-induced tumour cell death is a potent method of treating localised cancers, but has no curative potential wh en more disseminated disease is present. The radiati on-elicited tumour cell death coul d, however, be used as an ad- ditional immune activator during vaccination ther apy, due to the release of large amounts of tumour antigens and the alled \"danger signals\" which attract the immune system to the tumour. Thus it is becoming evident that immunotherapy is potentially synergistic with other cancer treatment modalities, su ch as chemotherapy and radiation therapy. This potential for synergy should allow cancer vaccines to become part of the standard treatment regimen for many common tumours within the near future (Svane/Straten, expert opinion). But doubts remain whether the cancers of a comm on histogenetic origin are antigenically suf- ficiently related to allow a common strategy of immunotherapy or vaccination for all or at least a majority of affected patients. This may result in the need for personalised cancer treatment because, in the absence of common tumour antigens, immunotherapy, and espe- cially vaccination, will depend on individual alterations of tumour cells that could be patient- specific. IPOL/A/STOA/ST/2006-21 PE 383.215 IPOL/A/STOA/ST/2006-21 Page 35 of 46 PE 383.215 Thus the target structure for immunotherapy in one patient might not be relevant to most other patients with the same disease. Such ther apies would be highly sp ecific and could offer a chance for a cure, but would also be rather cost-intensive. Moreover, antigen-directed cancer therapy might induce a selection process, promoting the loss of this specific antigen in the tumour cells a nd resulting in resistant clones, as is observed in recurrence of the disease after initially su ccessful radiotherapy or chemotherapy (Weller, expert opinion). Also to be considered are the possible advers e side effects connected with new therapies. Compared to the often severe toxic effects of conventional chemotherapy, at least vaccine therapies seem to be in general more compatib le (Svane/Straten, expert opinion) - an assess- ment made with the caveat that experience is still (very) li mited. One should keep in mind that the therapeutic potential of activating the immune system could also provoke autoim- mune reactions (Weller, expert opinion), especially in the case of tumour antigens which are not completely tumour-specific. And, with rega rd to the pre-testability and forecast of ad- verse side effects, it has to be taken into account that animal models are not suitable, as the nature of their antigens is di fferent from that of humans (S vane/Straten, expert opinion). Another difference in comparison with conventio nal chemotherapy is that the optimal dose is not necessarily based on the safety profile of the drug, but rather on the ability of the vaccine to induce biological and immunological activity (Svane/Straten, expert opinion). Due to the \"biological\" nature of immunotherapy, in many cases there will be no linear association be- tween vaccine dose and immune response. In summary, all three fields of innovative cance r therapy hold significant potentials for the treatment of tumour patients within the next decade, vaccine therapies and immunotherapies being probably the most promising. However, these will be combined with genetic ap- proaches thus fulfilling in part the current definition of gene therapy (Weller, expert opinion). Traditional hormonal and chemotherapy are sti ll important, but will decrease in importance with the use of targeted therapies by which, in the long run, they could possibly be com- pletely substituted. Not only as far as neuro- oncology is concerned, surgery will probably remain important, firstly, because it is nece ssary to make histological diagnoses and, sec- ondly, because surgery will be an integral part of all those innovative treatments delivered directly to the tumour tissue. This local approach is often pursued in the treatment of brain tumours (Weller, expert opinion). On the ot her hand, the example of modern breast cancer treatment shows that surgery will become prob ably less important at least in some cases (Untch, expert opinion).

Coverage by FP6 & 7 The Sixth Framework Programme of the Europ ean Commission and the Directorate-General for Research (FP6) was carried out from 2002 to 2006. Within the seven priority fields, the topic \"life science, genomics and biotechnology for health\" earned 20.9% of the total budget of 17.5 billion \u20ac. Cancer-related research, which is listed within this field and represents a priority of health research in general, wa s attributed a funding budget of approximately 450 million \u20ac. The objectives within the 6th Framework Progr amme concerning cancer were defined as \"to develop improved patient-oriented strategies for combating cancer - from prevention to more effective and earlier diagnosis, and better treatment with minimal side effects\" (http://cordis.europa.eu/lifescihealth/cancer /home.htm). Research was focused on Establishing facilities and developing initiativ es for the exploitation of research on cancer in Europe; encouraging the development of evidence-based guidelines for good clinical practice and improved public heal th strategies by accelerating the translation of existing research results into applications; Developing networks and initiatives to c oordinate national research activities; Supporting clinical resear ch, particularly clini cal trials, aimed at validating new and im- proved interventions; Supporting translational research aimed at bringing basic knowledge through to applica- tions in clinical pract ice and public health; Other issues related to cancer, such as ag eing and cancer, regiona l differences, psycho- social aspects, palliative car e and guidance to support groups. By the end of 2005, three calls for proposals rela ted to cancer were closed and 108 projects [29 IP (integrated projects), 64 STREPS (specifi c targeted research projects), 8 NoEs (net- works of excellence), 2 CAs (coordination ac tions) and 5 SSA (specific support actions)] with approximately 1500 particip ating institutions/labo ratories were funded; 64% of the en- tire budget was devoted to large-scale activi ties (255 million \u20ac for IPs and 66 million \u20ac for NoEs), and 35% (168 million \u20ac) was devoted to small scale activitie s (STREP) (European Commission, Directorate F2 - Cancer; presen tation of M. Vidal, STOA Panel meeting, Strasbourg, September 2006). The following areas were covered by FP6 (until the end of 2005, excluding the 4 th call) (http://cordis.europa.eu/lifescihealth/cancer/home.htm): Causes and mechanisms of cancer In this area, 46 projects (20 IP, 26 STREPs and 1 SSA) were funded. The total funding vol- ume was approximately 240 M \u20ac, which represents 49% of the total cancer research budget. The working fields in this area included: m echanisms controlling cancer development and progression, genetic mechanisms contributing to cancer susceptibility, and characterisation of cancer stem cells. Cancer treatment research This area included 37 projects (7 IP, 5 NoE, 25 STREPs) with a volume of 163 M \u20ac, repre- senting 34% of the total cancer research budge t and covering the following working fields: drug discovery, including gene therapy and immunotherapy (w ith a volume of 65M \u20ac), anti- cancer therapies concerning angiogenesis, me cells and others. IPOL/A/STOA/ST/2006-21 PE 383.215 IPOL/A/STOA/ST/2006-21 Page 37 of 46 PE 383.215 Another important task was the support of clini cal trials to evaluate the various treatment modalities in cancer treatment. Early detection and diagnosis In this area, 17 projects (2 IP, 1 NoE and 13 STREPs) with a volume of 60 M \u20ac were sup- ported, representing 12% of the total cancer res earch budget. Main focuses in this area were the development of new methods, based on asse ssing \"specific cancer markers\" in patient samples, and the development of new imaging devices and technologies for cancer diagnosis. Prevention and epidemiology In this area, 5 projects (2 NoE, 2 CAs, 1 SSA ), with a volume of 19M \u20ac, representing 4% of the total cancer research budget, were funded. Research proj ects in this area dealt with the role of risk factors in cancer development and improved cancer control mechanisms. Other areas support research on fam ily cancers, uncommon cancers, p aediatric cancers , palliative care and \"end of life\" issues. Distribution and focuses of funded projects com pared with findings from the literature scan The listed titles and given keyw ords of the funded projects re flect to a high degree those found in our literature scan covering the same time span, from 2002 to 2006. Only terms rep- resenting the very latest findings in molecular genetics, like siRNA or antisense RNA, were not found in the keyword lists of the funded projects. The majo rity of all funded projects (>50%) focused on new therapy approaches. In accordance with our literature analysis, no cl ear distinction could be made between the cancer treatments mentioned (s ee section 4.8). Overall, the terms immuno- or biological therapies gave the most hits. In many cases, combinations of different \"modern\" therapy ap- proaches or combinations of \"modern\" and \"c onventional\" therapie s were investigated. All in all, the sixth European Framework Programme reflects th e actual state of cancer re- search with its funded projects. The new FP7 w ill continue with efforts on translational re- search (which started with FP6) reinforcing c linical aspects of cancer research. One focus will be directed toward s innovative therapeutic approaches and interventions such as immu- notherapy, gene therapy, stem cell therapy, and vaccine therapy; in a ddition, the coordinating efforts in the field of cancer which have be gun within FP6 will be reinforced. A new initia- tive, Innovative Medicines Initiat ive (IMI), will develop a strate gic EU agenda for enhancing and accelerating R&D efforts on innovative medicines in general.

Concluding remarks A very basic but important finding is this: cancer is not only a very severe, but also a very complex and very heterogeneous disease. In fact , it is not one single disease, but a group of many different diseases, with several common a nd with many differing characteristics. This is the main reason why searching for be tter cancer therapies is so difficult. Therapeutic potential of the new approaches The overall picture shows a number of very prom ising preclinical results and some examples of established and effective treatments for singl e forms of cancer, especially in the field of prophylactic cancer vaccines (e.g. against HPV/ cervical cancer) and in cluding the use of monoclonal antibodies (like Herc eptin\u00ae/breast cancer). With respect to the prevention of many virus-associated cancers the road map is available for the actions to be taken (Sva- ne/Straten, expert opinion) , in terms of population-wide vaccination programmes. Although most of the approaches presented and disc ussed in this report are at an early stage of development and although their future medical outcome cannot be predicted reliably, the scientific findings behind many of them give rise to the hope for bett er cancer treatments in general. One of the most prominent is the stem -cell hypothesis (even if it is not yet accepted by all scientists) as part of the explanation of a fundame ntal problem of cancer therapy (see section 4.7): the recurrence of cancer, so-calle d remission, which is observed in most cancer cases and which can hardly be prevented by \"c onventional\" therapies. Because conventional therapies such as chemo- or radiotherapy are di rected only against the - fast - dividing cells, they are ineffective against re sidual, non-dividing or \"silent\" cancer stem cells which are re- sponsible for the re-growth of the tumour. If this theory is correct, this is the reason why at present it is reasonable to regard cancer, or at least many forms of cancer, as a chronic dis- ease, which cannot be cured but only controlled by medical mean s to achieve the best possi- ble quality of life. Essentially, all of the new appr oaches described above are not directed towards dividing cells, but are targeted towards specific propert ies of cancer cells as such or towards single types of tumours. Most of them are thought to work by stimulating the patient's immune sys- tem which, in the end, seems to be the most pot ent tool for fighting cancer. From a scientific or biomedical point of view, these approaches represent very rationa l and convincing strate- gies. And albeit on very different levels, a conn ection can be seen between these most recent biomedical findings and \"alternative\" or \"com plementary\" cancer theories and therapies, which often focus on the immunological state of cancer patients as well. With regard to the prospects for the next few years we must, however, accept that for the ma- jority of cancer patients, there are no simple and effective therapies in sight. Besides innova- tive approaches for some forms of cancer, to our knowledge the most reliable progress in fighting cancer is expected from further improve ments of conventional therapies, early diag- nosis, and preventive measures. These areas shou ld certainly be kept in mind when shaping future TA studies (see the following section). Research funding and cost-effectiveness As shown in the previous section, the new and promising approaches seem to be well- covered (or at least represen ted) by the EU research pr ogrammes and funding in FP6 and FP7. With regard to the cancer vacci ne concept, it is important to realise that it contains some weaknesses principally due to the following: products are often very complex, including sev- eral compounds, technical procedures are laborious or patient-specific biological material is necessary. IPOL/A/STOA/ST/2006-21 PE 383.215 IPOL/A/STOA/ST/2006-21 Page 39 of 46 PE 383.215 Consequently, cancer vaccine products frequently have insufficient commercial potential, and the pharmaceutical and biotechnological companies are, therefore, often less eager to invest in cancer vaccine development. As a result, this field of research has an enormous need for the provision of economic re- sources in order to continue advanc ing (Svane/Straten, expert opinion). Due to the early stage of research and devel opment for most of the gene, vaccine, and immu- notherapies, questions of cost-effectiveness can not reasonably be addre ssed in more detail. But, as this report shows, the new approaches te nd to be not only more specific but also more individual or even personalised, e.g. when the patient's own cells are tr eated or modified ex- tra-corporally and then used as a highly sp ecific remedy. Although there are no concrete fig- ures, it is very pr obable that such sophisticated treatment s will be very cost-intensive, a fact which was also brought up and discussed durin g the STOA workshop. Already today we can observe in Europe a very heterogeneous applic ation rates of modern therapies for economic reasons. An instructive example is provided by the case of Herceptin\u00ae, the use of which ac- tually represents a substantial financial challe nge for the public health insurance systems in many countries. Economic restrictions will increa se with the increasing progress in sophisti- cated cancer therapies and, therefore, it will be necessary to focus on this issue in the future (Untch, expert opinion). While treatment costs will certainly increase, further developments in cancer therapy will push forward general scientific and medical innovation and improvement, leading to positive economic and societal effects. Such spin-off e ffects cannot be foreseen on a quantitative level and, in most cases, cannot even be identified exactly in retrospect. Faster implementation of new therapy approac hes: Improving evaluation and approval re- gimes During the STOA workshop and in the expert opinions, the ques tion of drug approval proce- dures not being suitable, particularly for vacc ine therapies, was addressed. Considerations and demands of adjusting regulation frameworks in order to bring the new therapies to the patients faster include the adaptation of clinical testing, possibly in form of their simplifica-tion. Svane and Straten put special emphasis on th eir assessment that cancer vaccine issues generally need urgent attention if this field of research is to continue at an appropriate speed. Not only a boost in public funding would be necessary but also improved production, stan- dardisation, testing, and evaluation methods as well as a better co-ope ration between patent- holding firms (Svane/Str aten, expert opinion): Standardisation of the vaccine manufacturing process and characterisation of the vaccine product should be obligatory in order to reassure homogeneous tr eatment of the patients and, thereby, solidity of clinical st udies. Control of the individual va ccine components is a critical step in the standardisation procedure. Am ong the cancer vaccines currently under develop- ment, manufacturing patient-spe cific cell-based products includi ng tumour or dendritic cells entails the greatest technical, logistical and re gulatory challenges. Pr oducts which are not pa- tient-specific such as synthetic manufactured pe ptides and proteins are much easier to handle. The standard clinical study designs used for oncology drug development are based on criteria suitable for conventional chemotherapy with substa ntial toxicity, yet they are less appropriate for cancer vaccines. At the moment, cancer vaccine production is subjected to the same regu-lations as the production of any other medical product for human use. With the introduction of common EU regulations, a signi ficant drop in the numbers of clinical cancer vaccine trials has been observed in Europe. IPOL/A/STOA/ST/2006-21 PE 383.215 IPOL/A/STOA/ST/2006-21 Page 40 of 46 PE 383.215 The regulations obstruct researchers practically as well as economically in developing more complex cancer vaccines; they hinder expansion of early clinical testing, and ultimately delay discovery of new effective treatments for cancer. Guidelines regarding manufacturing, quality control, preclinical and clinical testing of cell- based products for human use, which could be a pplied to cancer vaccines as well, are under development and it has been announced that they will soon to be published by the Cell-based Product Working Party (CGWP) at the Europe an Medicines Agency (EMEA). The Cancer Vaccine Clinical Trial Working Group (CVCTW G) representing academia and the pharma- ceutical and biotechnology industr ies with participation of th e United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently published a cons ensus report in which the reduction of the classical clinical phases I, II and III to only two steps is prop osed: firstly \"proof-of-principle- trials\" and secondly efficacy trials (Hoos et al. 2007). This new two-pha se trial concept ac- knowledges the need of time for cancer vaccines to exert their effect via complex immu- nological mechanisms as well as the fact that cancer vaccines do not typically induce dra- matic tumour reductions. A topic of special relevance is the standardisation and certification of biological monitoring methods necessary for th e proof-of-principle phase, dealt with in a European Cancer Immunotherapy Cons ensus Group (CIMT; www.c-imt.org). Company ownerships and protective policies creat e barriers to the generation of promising combinations with new drugs. It would be an important boost to the cancer vaccine field if the medical and biotechnological industries a llowed access to their promising developmental products for investigation in comb inatory cancer vaccine trials. Overall, continuous and extensive cooperation be tween laboratories, the industry and clinics would be essential in order to tackle the remain ing challenges and apprec iate the full potential of 46 PE 383.215 11. Outlook: Prospects and challenges of comprehensive TA studies on cancer As expressed in the work plan of this project , the overall aim of the pre-study was to lay the ground for a possible future comprehensive TA study on future developments in cancer ther- apy. The general objective of such a comprehe nsive study for the European Parliament was defined as \"to provide a basis for dealing with the question wh ether European research fund- ing is adequate compared with the dimension of the problem\". Bearing in mind the analytical depth which is in some respects limited and wh ich could be performed within the scope of this pre-study, we can conclude that research both on the molecular causes and mechanisms of cancer as well as on new therapy appro aches are well-represented in FP6 & FP7. We cannot, however, give a defin ite answer to the question of whether the funding of re- search into the improvement of conventional therapies, early diagnosis, and preventive meas- ures is adequate. At first glance, preventi on and epidemiology play only a minor role in European cancer research funding, but this is prob ably due to the fact th at players other than the European Union are more important, particul arly the WHO. In any case, it would be nec- essary to analyse these areas as extensively (a t least) as has been done for the new therapy approaches in this pre-study. Cancer and the European research agenda An interesting and illuminating task could be to check which areas of cancer research are sys- tematically under-represented on the current rese arch agenda, e.g. because they promise no or only very limited economic benefits. In the course of our project, research into the improve- ment of long-established convent ional therapies was explicitly judged as economically and scientifically less attractive (albeit necessary) by several interviewed experts. If such an investigation were to be performe d on an ambitious level, it certainly would be time-consuming and demanding. Since the aim woul d then be a kind of evaluation of the European research agenda towards cancer, su ch a study should be scheduled on a medium- term basis providing useful results for the seco nd part of the European Research Programme 7 (FP7) and, above all, for the preparation of FP 8. In order to gather and include all the rele- vant information and viewpoints as well as with regard to a possible far-reaching impact of such an investigation, it is imperative to c ooperate with as many in stitutions, organisations, and stakeholders as possible in cluding those from science, indus try, patients' organisations, and health authorities. It is also necessary to check in detail which other expert circles are concerned with similar questions. Certainly, it will be vital to devel op a detailed and very thorough concept for such a project. Adjusting evaluation and approval proce dures - not only for cancer therapies As discussed in the previous section, the exis ting clinical study designs and overall approval procedures do not seem to be well-suited for new cancer therapy approaches. This is due to the much more individualised strategy of gene and immunotherapies (using laborious techni- cal procedures and patient specific biological products with several compounds) compared to classical chemotherapy. As we know from severa l other TA projects, th is increased complex- ity and diversity is a common f eature of many, if not all, m odern biomedical technologies, therapies, and drugs. IPOL/A/STOA/ST/2006-21 PE 383.215 IPOL/A/STOA/ST/2006-21 Page 42 of 46 PE 383.215 With this in mind, the need to adjust evalua tion and approval procedur es is reported from many areas of up-to-date drug and therapy devel opment on the basis of the results of molecu- lar biology. The design of clinical studies and rules for clinical testing are crucial issues, not only for medical but also for economic reasons. The more custom-made the therapies are, the more difficult - and sometimes impossible - it is to find the mandatory number of patients as participants for the different clinical test phases. This difficulty enhances the costs of drug developmen t which represent a hurdle for the pharmaceutical industry and lead to substant ial cost increases for the health systems. Competitiveness and regulation issues related to modern biomedical technologies are ad- dressed by a number of initiatives and proj ects, also by ETAG members (for example, ITAS/TAB will perform an innovation report, focusing on Germany, but comparing different European and overseas countries). As regard s a future similar study for STOA, we recom- mend a discussion of whether - while taking th ese ongoing activities into account - such an analysis should be restricted to a single technol ogy (like cancer therapy) or to incorporate dif- ferent case studies. Obviously, the latter approach would be more laborious, but could pro- vide a better basis for comparative assessment of the relevance of the different problems and challenges.
