The analyses of 30 kb RNA SARS-CoVs genome sequences, protein structures, and functions have provided us a perspective of how host-virus protein-protein complexes act to mediate virus infection. The open reading frame (ORF)1a and ORF1b translation yields 16 non-structural (nsp1-16) and 6 accessory proteins (p6, p7a, p8ab, p9b) with multiple functional domains. Viral proteins recruit over 300 host partners forming hetero-oligomeric complexes enabling the viral RNA synthesis, packing, and virion release. Many cellular host factors and the innate immune cells through pattern-recognition receptors and intracellular RNA sensor molecules act to inhibit virus entry and intracellular replication. However, non-structural ORF proteins hijack them and suppress interferon synthesis and its antiviral effects. Pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines storm leads to dysfunctional inflammation, lung injury, and several clinical symptoms in patients. During the global pandemic, COVID-19 patients were identified with non-synonymous substitution of G614D in the spike protein, indicating virus co-evolution in host cells. We review findings that suggest that host RNA editing and DNA repair systems, while carrying on recombination, mutation, and repair of viral RNA intermediates, may facilitate virus evolution. Understanding how the host cell RNA replication process may be driven by SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome fitness will help the testing of vaccines effectiveness to multiple independent mutated coronavirus strains that will emerge. SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19; Immunity; Virus evolution; Vaccines Introduction Metagenomic analysis of microbial communities have provided deep insights into the origin and functional dynamics of infectious diseases in the entire living world. Direct genetic analysis of DNA/RNA molecules can reveal potential loss (deletion) or gain (duplication) of genes of the vectors and host cells that predispose or prevent human diseases (11. N\u00e9d\u00e9lecY, SanzJ, BaharianG, SzpiechZA, PacisA, DomainA, et al. Genetic ancestry and natural selection drive population differences in immune responses to is a natural process for species evolution and adaptation to new ecological niches and host switching. We are continuously changing our continents and habitats introducing chemical hazards and toxic substances that can mutate and increase transmissibility and contagiousness of evolutionarily distant pathogens. Some earth environments and cultural and behavioral factors are more conducive to the spread of common parasites, bacteria, and viruses across Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East (11. N\u00e9d\u00e9lecY, SanzJ, BaharianG, SzpiechZA, PacisA, DomainA, et al. Genetic ancestry and natural selection drive population differences in immune responses to pathogens. Cell 2016; 167: 657-669, doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2016.09.025. [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2016.09.0... ](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2016.09.025)). Overtime, the modern Homo sapiens has survived over 20 plagues, such as influenza virus pandemic (Spanish flu), smallpox, cholera, measles, tuberculosis, and recently the coronaviruses (22. Zhu N, Zhang D, Wang W, Li X, Yang B, Song J, et al. A novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in China, 2019. N Med 2020; studies emerged over two million microbial strains and species (33. Belizario JE, Napolitano M. The microbiomes and their roles in dysbiosis, common diseases and novel 1050, strains belonging to the Klebsiella pneumoniae ST258, have infected one-third of the human population and remain under active evolutionary transmission (44. Lee CR, Lee JH, Park KS, Kim YB, Jeong BC, Lee SH. Global dissemination of carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae: epidemiology, genetic context, treatment options, and Microbiol 2016; 7: 895, doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2016.00895. [https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2016.00895... ](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2016.00895)). Penicillin, the first antibiotic, discovered in 1928, may be completely innocuous to most bacterial infections in the near future (55. Hutchings MI, Truman AW, Wilkinson B. Antibiotics: past, can pass on their recessive or resistance genes to progeny a thousand timescale faster than humans. This unparalleled adaptive mutability and evolutionarily acquired resistance among bacterial and virus strains seem to be beyond Darwinian principles of evolutionary adaptation (66. Kennedy DA, Read AF. Why the evolution of vaccine resistance is less of a concern than the evolution of drug resistance. Proc eukaryotic cells counteracting intrinsic mechanisms that might be helping microorganism evolution? How will the human immune system evolve from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS)-CoV-2 pandemic? Could SARS-CoV-2 mutated strains develop the capacity to replicate and transmit from vaccinated hosts? I present here a conceptual framework for understanding the virus and human immunity co-evolution, and some approaches and challenges in the vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2. How do immune cells respond to microbial infection? In 1883, Elie Metchnikoff described phagocytosis as a process of cellular engulfment of solid particles when a small citrus thorn was injected into starfish larva (77. Metchnikoff E. Immunity in infective diseases, by Elie Metchnikoff. With a new introd. by Gert H. Brieger. Emil Behring and Kitasato Shibasaburo described anti-toxin activity of horse blood serum for treatment of diphtheria - a disease described by Hippocrates. The diphtheria toxin is produced by the bacterium Corynebacterium diphtheria infected by a bacteria virus - a bacteriophage. In 1897, Paul Ehrlich, the first Nobel Prize winner immunologist, proposed the side-chain theory to explain the antitoxin effect, e.g. the antibody mechanism of action (77. Metchnikoff E. Immunity in infective diseases, by Elie Metchnikoff. With a new introd. by Gert H. Brieger. 1950s, MacFarlane Burnet and Niels Jerne were the protagonists of the two models built to explain how an immune response develops. They created the self and non-self concept, in which self are constituents of the human body, not triggering an immune response. Non-self are foreign substances, such as pathogens or tissues and organs genetically distinct that would trigger an immune response. Their discoveries about the natural selection theory for antibody formation and diversity are still widely accepted (88. Jerne NK. The natural-selection theory of acquired immunity. Nashville: Vanderbilt Univ. Press; 1959.). Based on these fundamental findings, we began to understand the evolution and complex interplay between myeloid and lymphoid cells and their cooperative roles in innate (non-specific defense) and adaptive (specific defense) immune responses. The humoral - or adaptive immune - system emerged about 500 million year ago when a jewfish transposon inserted the recombination activating gene (RAG) into the lymphoid cell genome of a jawed vertebrate. RAG-1 and RAG-2 are enzymes that recognize and cleave recombination signal sequences (RSSs) in DNA gene sequence, thereby promoting a somatic recombination (1010. Kaufman J. 10.1111/j.1365-2567.2010.03294.x. [https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2567.2010... ](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2567.2010.03294.x)). With the power of DNA technology, the major questions relating to antibody formation and diversity were solved in the 1970s. A fundamental study by Sussumu Tonegawa, awarded with Nobel Prize of Medicine in 1987, showed how recombination and somatic hypermutation cause the rearrangement of variable-diversity-joining (V-D-J) regions of immunoglobulin (Ig) genes (1111. Hozumi N, Tonegawa S. Evidence for somatic rearrangement of immunoglobulin genes coding for variable and constant into the germline genome generates a repertoire of B cell receptors (BCRs) or diversification of immunoglobulins that enable randomly finding new antigens. Next, it was demonstrated that the same combinatorial joining and the somatic V-D-J recombination mechanism operate for generation of T cell receptors (TCRs) in T lymphocytes. TCRs target an infinite range of antigens that T cells will have to face over their lifetimes. A peptide from a pathogen protein is recognized by unique a TCR molecule through class I and II molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). The clearest example of this structural feature of T-cell recognition was first demonstrated by Zinkernagel and Doherty (1212. Zinkernagel RM, Doherty PC. MHC restricted cytotoxic T cells: studies on the biological role of polymorphic major transplantation antigens determining T the authors were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1996. These fundamental knowledges forwarded the recent technological advances in the field of immunology that allow organ transplantation, antibody-mediated immunotherapies, and development of vaccines against many infectious diseases. Our first microbial contact occurs at birth. The initial microbial colonization of the infant gut with a great diversity of bacteria, virus, fungi, and parasites is essential for the education of the immune system and host-microbe co-evolution (33. Belizario JE, Napolitano M. The microbiomes and their roles in dysbiosis, common diseases and novel 1050, doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2015.01050. [https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2015.01050... ](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2015.01050)). is the residence of a viral microbiome composed mainly by bacteriophages and RNA and DNA viruses (1313. Kumata R, Ito J, Takahashi K, Suzuki T, Sato K. A tissue level atlas of the healthy human use a dynamic system of the adaptive immune defense named CRISPR (clustered regularly interspersed palindromic repeats) in which they pack viral RNA or DNA segments. In this way, bacteria and archaea memorize the RNA/DNA structure of bacteriophages and recognize and kill them at their re-infection (1414. Rho M, Wu YW, Tang H, Doak TG, Ye Y. Diverse defense is similar to RNA interference pathway of eukaryotic cells (1414. Rho M, Wu YW, Tang H, Doak TG, Ye Y. Diverse - releasing molecules like N-acyl-homoserine lactones or peptides - to directly or indirectly stop pathogenic species overgrowth and limit their crossing through host tissue barriers. How does immunity evolve in humans to fight the pathogens they host? Early in life, large lymphocytes (lymphoblast) migrate into the intestinal lamina propria and initiate a mucosal immune system (1515. Brandtzaeg P. Function of mucosa-associated the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) maturation, diversification, and differentiation into B cells - B1 and B2 populations - capable to produce secretory IgA (SIgA) and IgM antibodies and long-lived plasma cells. Within these sites, specialized epithelial cells, stroma cells, and native B cells inhibit virulence and overgrowth of commensal bacteria carrying pathogenicity through low-affinity, cross-reactive, and specie-specific IgA/IgM B cell antibodies also provide mechanismsto suppress pathologic reactivity against self, known as mucosal tolerance. Numerous germinal centers (GC) are colonized with of (DCs), CD4+ T cells, cytotoxic T cells (CTLs), and natural killer cells (NKs), which are able to discriminate self and non-self luminal antigens from infected cells. However, an overreaction of immune cells against self as well as non-self microbial antigens is suppressed by thymic (t) or CD4+CD25+ immunoregulatory T cell (Treg) population (1616. Sakaguchi S. repertoire that recognizes self and non-self antigen, thus they play a central role in B and T cell immune tolerance (1717. Wing JB, Tanaka A, Sakaguchi S. Human FOXP3+ regulatory T cell heterogeneity and function doi: 10.1016/j.immuni.2019.01.020. [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.immuni.2019.01... ](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.immuni.2019.01.020)). How does the immune system recognize an incoming pathogenic virus and acquire an immunological memory? The antigen-presenting cells (APCs) or innate immune cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, display a variety of pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), or sensors of danger, specialized in the recognition of the pathogen's components, which are referred to as PAMPs and DAMPs (pathogen associated molecular pattern, damage-associated molecular patterns, respectively) (1818. Takeuchi O, Akira S. Pattern recognition receptors host cells bind and activate a variety of PRR, specifically, toll-like receptor (TLR) and nod-like receptors (NLRs), which recruit and activate the inflammasomes (1818. Takeuchi O, Akira S. Pattern recognition immunoproteosomes or lysosomes generates a peptide epitope. Dendritic cells and macrophages present viral peptides to T helper CD4+ cells through MHC Class II molecules, or to cytotoxic CD8+ T cells through MHC class I molecules. Once activated, these cells drive the synthesis of hundreds of cytokines and chemokines, which carry messages for growth, differentiation, or cell death. B cells can respond directly to virus antigens and become activated by them and also interact with CD4+ T cells. IgM is the first high-avidity antibody produced by B cells against a pathogen (3-5 days after infection); the high-affinity and neutralizing IgG classes are produced after 2 weeks. This transition (shift) from high-avidity IgM to high-affinity IgG occurs with the aid The APOBEC protein family: united by structure, divergent the transcripts of immunoglobulin variants in B cells and thus antibody diversity, e.g., variable regions in the antibody protein, to randomly recognize new antigens (2020. Salter JD, Bennett RP, Smith HC. The APOBEC protein family: united by structure, divergent T helper CD4+ cells, cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, and B plasma cells after a primary infection is only partially understood (2121. Youngblood B, Hale JS, Ahmed R. T-cell mice and humans have demonstrated that epigenetic, and not genetic mechanisms, are responsible for imprinting chemical signatures (memory) in DNA regions and histone proteins using diverse specialized enzymes. In this way, groups of genes and their promoters are methylated or demethylated in memory cells and turn on if recruited to combat a second infection (2121. Youngblood B, Hale JS, Ahmed R. T-cell Kissick HT, Li KW, et al. Origin and differentiation of human memory CD8 T cells after vaccination. Nature lymphoid cells (ILCs), monocytes, and macrophages can also develop innate immune memory by similar mechanisms (2323. Netea MG, Schlitzer A, Placek K, Joosten LAB, Innate and adaptive immune memory: an evolutionary continuum in the host's response 10.1016/j.chom.2018.12.006. [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2018.12.0... ](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2018.12.006)). Trained innate immunity can be induced with classical immune stimulants such as bacterial LPS (lipopolysaccharide) and Innate and adaptive immune memory: an evolutionary continuum in the host's response isolate epigenetically long-lived memory cells for passive cell immunization? Would this cell therapy work better than vaccination? Recently, we have learned how immune checkpoint molecules specifically dampen TCR-mediated intracellular pathways. In 2018, the Nobel Prize of medicine was awarded to James Allison and Tasuku Honjo for their contribution to novel cancer immunotherapy based on the negative immune checkpoint blockage. Specific monoclonal antibodies to immune checkpoint proteins increase cytotoxic activity of exhausted T cells that recognize foreign antigens and neo-antigens in cancer patients (2424. Sharma P, Allison JP. The future of 56-61, doi: 10.1126/science.aaa8172. [https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa8172... ](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa8172)). Why checkpoint antibodies to reinvigorate an effector and memory CD8+ T cells in the context of vaccination? Virus-induced replication and repair in host cells Viruses live intracellularly for hours or days and occasionally can integrate into host DNA causing genome instability (2525. Gram AM, Frenkel J, Ressing ME. Inflammasomes and viruses: cellular defence 2063-2075, doi: virus, dengue virus, and coronavirus, due to the error-prone and low-efficient RNA polymerases, tend to have high mutation rates during replication (2626.

Many DNA and RNA viruses counteract cell death by apoptosis through expression of viral homologs of Bcl-2 family of antiapoptotic proteins and inhibitors of such cytokine A mechanisms are manipulated by SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins is not known yet. Most viruses trigger a DNA damage response (DDR), an emergency signaling pathway mediated by kinase enzymes ATM (ataxia telangiectasia protein catalytic subunit) in order to avoid host cell genome instability (3030. Weitzman MD, Fradet-Turcotte A. Virus DNA replication and the host DNA damage response.

Virus DNA replication and the host DNA damage response. Annu provides breaks in DNA molecules facilitating the integration of provirus (viral transduction). Curiously, host genomic DNA released by dying cells during a virus lytic cycle acts as endogenous DAMPs, thus serving as a danger signal that can cause intense inflammation (3131. West AP, Shadel GS.

What is known and expected about SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection and APOBEC antiretroviral defense? Recent studies have confirmed APOBECs motifs in mutational signature of the coronavirus genome (3636. Giorgio S, Martignano F, Torcia MG, Mattiuz G, Conticello SG.

[https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.023... ](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237689)). This powerful editing mechanism might exert the essential role in editing new beneficial variant genes to protect the human genome of retrovirus invasion. On the other hand, hypermutation mediated by cytoplasmic A3s APOBECs by introducing SNPs and potential mutation on SARS-CoV genomic RNA may be conferring advantage to viral adaptation and transmissibility (3939. Chen B, Tian EK, He B, Tian L, Han R, Wang S, et al. Overview of lethal human coronaviruses. Signal Transduct Target Ther 2020; 5: 89, ](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-020-0190-2)). The organization of an accurately curated sequence database and molecular epidemiology studies of divergent human coronaviruses with distinct mutational signatures will help us to answer these questions. Virus-induced host cell immune response COVID-19 patients develop an acute respiratory distress syndrome, which can be mild, moderate, or severe, leading to high mortality of patients (22.

Many can be predictive biomarkers of the virus-induced immune response and clinical outcomes, and only a few are known (22. Zhu N, Zhang D, Wang W, Li X, Yang B, Song J, et al.

The current and future state of vaccines, antivirals and gene therapies against emerging The severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and its life cycle and host immune response to viral infection. ACE2 is a cellular receptor in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and the intestine that binds to the viral (S) protein and is cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits by an cleaved and activated by TMPRSS2. The SARS-CoV is a large enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus (30 kb) in which 5' two-thirds encodes the two large open reading frames (ORFs) and is transcribed and translated into two polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab) collectively termed the replicase. The 3' one-third of the SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes four essential structural proteins (S, spike, M, membrane, N, nucleocapsid, and E, envelope) and a set of functional non-structural (Nsp) and accessory proteins (ORFs), which are essential for evading immune response. SARS-CoV-2 is detected by various intercellular sensors, such as RIG I and TLR-3, -7/8, and -9. Viral peptides are presented via MHC I and II to tissue-residing APCs, such as dendritic cells and macrophages, which, IL-1, IL-17, TNF-, etc. Cytokines the adaptive immune response by recruiting and activating CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and B cells that orchestrate the production of antibodies IgM, IgA, IgG, and cytotoxic factors (perforin and granzymes) for killing the virus-infected cells.

SARS-COV-2 vaccine design The classical vaccination concept was created in 1796 by Edward Jenner who evaluated the efficacy of calf lymph or cowpox inoculation to protect children against smallpox disease (variola). New forms of vaccination and innovative technologies were developed for designing and producing vaccines on a large scale (5252.

Vaccines prepared with purified antigens - one or various subunits of virus protein - elicit good humoral antibody response if administered with an exogenous adjuvant (5555.

Modified Vaccinia Virus Ankara (MVA) is a replication-deficient viral vector that has been used to create promising novel multivalent vaccines for respiratory viruses (5656. Wong SH, Jassey A, Wang JY, Wang WC, Liu CH, Lin LT. Virus-like particle systems for vaccine development against viruses in the Flaviviridae family. Vaccines 2019; 7: 123, doi: 10.3390/vaccines7040123. [https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines7040123... ](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines7040123)). Virus proteins can be assembled as three-dimensional viral structures composed of virus-like particles (VLPs) with multiple target sites (5454. Coffman RL, Sher A, Seder RA. Vaccine adjuvants: putting work. ](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature01509)). Vaccine through serological studies that determine the variability or conservation of the antigen epitopes (5858. Wyrzucki A, Bianchi M, Kohler I, Steck M, Hangartner L. Heterosubtypic antibodies to influenza A virus have limited activity against cell-bound virus but are not impaired by acid epitopes on the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NE) proteins showed that they display either highly variable or conserved cross-reactivity (5858. Wyrzucki A, Bianchi M, Kohler I, Steck M, Hangartner L. Heterosubtypic antibodies to influenza A virus have limited activity against cell-bound virus but are not impaired by high genetic variability - named antigenic shift - usually develop resistance to adaptive immune responses and antiviral agents, which is why universal vaccines fail. However, studies undertaken during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic showed that the vaccine prepared with the head domain of the H1 hemagglutinin protein displayed limited variability and induced heterosubtypic immunity, e.g., cross-protection to emergent influenza virus subtypes (5959.

Discovery of a rich gene pool of bat SARS-related coronaviruses provides new insights into the vaccines may not be equally effective against all coronavirus strains. All virus components can function as potential antigen; however, most viruses are first detected through their nucleic acids, specifically, dsRNA, ssRNA, and DNA molecules by host cell specialized cytosolic sensors and adaptors (1919. Rathinam VAK, Fitzgerald KA. TLR9, as well as RIG-I (retinoic-acid-inducible interferon-inducible protein 16 (IFI16), the interferon-inducible protein Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1), and melanoma-differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA-5) are major sensors that recognize viral nucleic acids within the endosomes and autophagic bags through their helicase domain. The mitochondria-associated of genes (STING), tethering protein 2 (MFN2), and the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) are examples of adaptor proteins, which are anchored in the outer mitochondrial membrane where they interact with sensor proteins (1919. Rathinam VAK, Fitzgerald KA. Inflammasome complexes: and DNA and host mitochondrial DNA fragments act as a DAMP that contribute to self and non-self discrimination to activate immune response (3232.

Various strategies and regimes were applied to develop over 160 candidate vaccines to SARS-CoV-2, of which 30 potential candidates have advanced to II and III clinical phases, according to the World Health Organization, in August 2020 (Supplementary Table S1). The first inactivated whole SARS-CoV-1 virus vaccine demonstrated safety and high immunogenicity (7171. Gao Q, Bao L, Mao H, Wang L, Xu K, Yang M, et al. Development of an inactivated vaccine candidate whole SARS-CoV-2 candidate vaccine (7272. Xia S, Duan K, Zhang Y, Zhao D, Zhang H, Xie Z, et al.

Safety and immunogenicity of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2: a preliminary report of a phase 1/2, single-blind, are ongoing randomized phase III clinical trials in various countries. The first lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated mRNA vaccine, called mRNA-1273, encoding the stabilized perfusion SARS-CoV-2 spike protein advanced to phase III (7575. Jackson EJ, Rouphael NG, Roberts PC, Makhene Couler RN, et al. An mRNA vaccine against - to increase its immunogenicity - advanced to phases I and II (7676. Mulligan Lyke KE, Kitchin N, Absalon J, Gurtman A, Lockhart S, et al. Phase 1/2 study of COVID-19 RNA vaccine BNT162b1 in adults. vaccines that express virus-like particles do not assemble to form a virus in vivo. A clinically relevant concern with all vaccines is induction of inflammatory response and cross-reactive antibodies that could cause antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) side effects, as documented for dengue and respiratory syncytial virus vaccines in humans (7777. Yager EJ. Antibody-dependent whether a vaccine will be successful in the late stages (phase III) of development, we need to define dominant epitopes to helper CD4+ T-lymphocytes, cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, and B-cell receptors as well as peptide-MHC complexes in vaccinated people compared to recovered COVID-19 patients. The repertoire of the HLA molecules - a haplotype - may be associated with the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 in different people. The comparative mapping of immunogenicity will help to choose the best epitopes that are recognized by a larger number of HLA alleles in inter-populations with genetic differences. Could this information be transduced into the development of an optimal SARS-CoV-2 vaccine? Reverse genetic systems for coronaviruses are now available for generation of infectious clones and larger panels of derivative mutants (7878. Cockrell AS, Beall A, Yount B, Baric R. Efficient reverse genetic systems for rapid genetic manipulation of emergent and preemergent that the use of such biotechnological approaches will facilitate the pathogenesis studies of wild type and mutant types containing gain and loss of function mutation in cell lines and animal models. Most viruses are mucosa-transmitted; thus, understanding the rules that mediate immunity at mucosal tissues remain a critical issue (7979. Zheng Z, Diaz-Ar\u00e9valo D, Guan H, Zeng M. Noninvasive vaccination against messengers: innate sensing of viruses and cytokine regulation of immunity - clues for treatments and vaccines. Viruses 2013; 5: 470-527, doi: 10.3390/v5020470. [https://doi.org/10.3390/v5020470... ](https://doi.org/10.3390/v5020470)). generate the systemic humoral and cytotoxic T cell responses, and most importantly, the secretion of sIgA by plasma cells in local and regional MALT, GALT, nasal-associated lymphoid tissue Brandtzaeg Function intranasal mucosal immunization with SARS-CoV VLPs assembled in induced sIgA and IgG against SARS-CoV-1 (8181. Lu B, Huang Y, Huang L, Zheng Z, Chen Z, Chen J, et al. Effect of mucosal and systemic immunization with virus-like particles of severe acute respiratory syndrome with intranasal immunization with ChAd-SARS-CoV-2 developed mucosal IgA and T cell responses (8282. Hassan AO, Kafai NM, Dmitriev IP, Fox JM, Smith BK, Harvey IB, et al. A single-dose intrasal ChAd vaccine protects upper and lower respiratory systemic IgA antibodies act by blockading epithelial receptors and thus inhibiting the entrance of microbial and viral pathogens within the specialized mucosal epithelium and mucosal lymphoid follicles. Therefore, mucosal IgA can mediate immune exclusion as well as induction of oral tolerance in some cases. This paradox illustrates the complexity of the mucosal immune system. Innate lymphoid cell (ILC) subsets within mucosal tissues play important roles in the innate and adaptive mucosal immunity (8383. Eberl G, Colonna M, Di Santo JP, McKenzie AN. Innate lymphoid cells. Innate lymphoid cells: as CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells, but they can modulate their acquired immune response through production of cytokines that provide the local Th1/Th2 balance (8383. Eberl G, Colonna M, Di Santo JP, McKenzie AN. Innate lymphoid cells. Innate lymphoid cells: more specific to intracellular pathogens (virus), while ILC-2 subtype provides Th2 immune response to fight large parasites (helminths) and extracellular microbes. Pulmonary ILC-2 subtype is implicated in chronic respiratory inflammation and diseases (8484. Takeuchi O, Akira S. Pattern recognition 140: doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2010.01.022. [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2010.01.0... ](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2010.01.022)). Studies is predominant in responses in convalescing COVID-19 cases (5050. Li G, Fan Y, Lai Y, Han T, Li Z, Zhou P, et al. Coronavirus infections and immune responses. of presenting viral antigens to helper CD4+ T and modulating a Th1 response after mucosal vaccination. Adjuvants are immunostimulants added to vaccine formulations aiming to activate local immunocompetent innate immune cells to release cytokines (IL-12 and type I IFN-) and priming CD4+ T (5555. Altenburg AF, Rimmelzwaan GF et al. Modified vaccinia virus ankara (MVA) as production platform for vaccines against influenza and other viral respiratory diseases. Viruses 2014; 6: 2735-2761, doi: as adjuvant for nearly a century (8686. Petrovsky N.

Aoshi T. Modes immune responses (8181. Lu B, Huang Y, Huang L, Zheng Z, Chen Z, Chen J, et al. Effect of mucosal and systemic immunization with virus-like particles of severe acute respiratory syndrome of safe mucosal vaccines for SARS-CoV-2, we need to learn how to control immunogenicity properties of newly developed adjuvants to avoid tolerance commonly observed after mucosal vaccination (8585. Aoshi T. Modes of The mammalian immune system is under evolutionary pressure in the battle to survive with continuous spread of bacterial, fungal, parasitic, and viral pathogenic zoonotic diseases. So far there are no clear biomarkers that help differentiate SARS-CoV-2 infectiousness and outcomes in asymptomatic to mild, moderate, and severe cases of COVID-19. Studies suggest that novel progeny from the SARS-CoVs in different species have accumulated existing mutations giving them advantages. The transition has favored beneficial traits to transmit and co-evolve in human host cells in the course of the global spread. We need to learn how to control selection pressures on the dynamic immune response and RNA editing processes that have allowed viral mRNA mutation, recombination, and genetic stability to stop the new viral strains to evolve. Seromic-based screening in cured COVID-19 patients will be useful to identify new protein variants that escape strain-specific adaptive immune responses. Certain peptide epitopes and HLA alleles, which are increasing or decreasing, could help to identify susceptibility to COVID-19 and host response to the infection. Together, these results will contribute greatly to screening potential protein epitopes and innate immune evasion factors in datasets. Ideally, this information will support innovative strategies for antiviral therapies, new diagnostic tests of T cell immunity, and peptide vaccine candidates. In addition, epidemiology and genetic data should inform biomarkers for vaccine success and failure. How can epigenetic biomarkers of adaptive and innate immunity memory cells be explored to increase SARS-CoV-2 vaccine effectiveness? Could mucosal adjuvants that induce cytokine burst predominantly from ILCs provide a better response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccine? These are some scientific questions that are worth pursuing in the future. We hope scientists will come up with new ideas and solutions in different forms of serendipity to answer these questions before a novel virus pandemic happens.
