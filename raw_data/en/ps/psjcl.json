Today, the therapeutic applications of light and color are being investigated in hospitals and research centers worldwide. Dr. Jacob Liberman O.D., Ph.D., in his book \"Light Medicine For the Future,\" bridges the gap between scientific knowledge, health, and personal evolution. This book describes the body as a living photocell stimulated and regulated by light entering the eyes. The pineal gland, as the body's light meter, assists us to come into harmony and balance. Nobel Prize winner, Albert Szert-Gyorgy, recognized how profoundly light and color affects us. He found that many enzymes and hormones, when stimulated by selected colors of light, undergo molecular changes and cause dynamic reactions within the body. In my own work, I have found that when I test the client for the color light that will bring harmony, balance, and healing to them, it is usually the color to which they have an aversion, or the color that is lacking in their energy field. In the treatments that I offer, color is irradiated with focused beams of color light onto specific points in the twelve meridians of the body. Some other methods of introduction of color are through the seven chakras and aura. I use the eyes, the skin, the chakras, or the aura or energy field. The client will be sent home with the color filters that they need, and instructions on how to use them every day. Home therapy might include using colored silk, solorized water, stones or glass, food, clothes, flower essences, essential oils, and meditation with color. Different colored lights are used on the acupoints of the body. These frequencies travel through the body's meridian channels to clear and deprogram, repattern, and align your energies. These new energy patterns will later be duplicated in your cells and DNA. Sound can also be used on the acupoints with tuning forks in the correct note for any point. A series of 6 treatments is recommended. Current and past life release of calcified molecules of emotion and thoughts and the harmonizing of the quantum light body using aromacology and the psychology of light. Specially blended aromas developed by French medium and color therapist Patricia Janus unleash the hidden blocks that keep you from moving forward and reveal the potentials and qualities dormant within you, and open you to new files of consciousness. This is a unique treatment developed by French homeopathic medical doctor and chi gong master Dr. Cam. The color pedagoscope is made of ten different plates with different colors corresponding to the Sefirot of Kabalistic tree of life. The colors used in the plates are made with flower pigments used in the Steiner schools. The colors are ordered according to the Sefirot, and the client will look at each plate for five to seven minutes in natural light. The treatment works as a channel to identify energetic blockages and disturbances in the body and in the subtle energy fields around the body. Through the eyes, each color will work to feed the energy to the nervous system, the meridians, and the chakras from within the body, and also to balance the right and left sides of the brain, and to calm the mind.
