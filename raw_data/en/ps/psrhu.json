Let's end that today and discover all the ways your children can use crystals and gemstones to overcome their unique challenges! Children are actually prime candidates for using crystals, and here's why: - To a child, everything is magical, so they are especially drawn to crystals and things that seem to produce an almost magical result. - They are open and spiritual by nature. To them, everything is alive - even their teddy bears and dolls. - To kids, all things are possible, and their faith in the \"impossible\" hasn't been dulled by the disbelief of society. For all of these reasons, children often have a natural connection to the mineral kingdom. They gravitate toward crystals and have an innate sensitivity to their healing powers. How Do Crystals and Gemstones Benefit Children? Crystals help children just as they help adults, but maybe even more so because children are often more receptive to their healing powers. The issues and difficulties that kids face impact them as they learn, grow and develop, and a crystal can be a welcome friend to help them thrive and flourish.
