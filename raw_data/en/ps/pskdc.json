Your child is likely to heal faster with less pain compared to traditional surgery that uses larger cuts. Also called minimally invasive surgery.| |Laparoscopic surgery||An operation in which the surgeon makes small \"\"keyhole\"\" incisions in the belly and inserts thin metal sleeves, or tubes, called trocars through these incisions. The trocars allow surgeons to insert a small video camera and surgical instruments for the procedure. During a laparoscopic surgery, your child's belly is filled with carbon dioxide (CO2). This creates a space or a bubble in which to do surgery. Surgery is performed by watching a TV monitor and moving the surgical instruments from outside of your child's body. The advantage of this technique is that surgeons don't need to cut through as much tissue as when they make a longer incision. This means your child is likely to heal and recover faster. Laparoscopic surgery is also called minimally invasive surgery.| |Large bowel||Also called the colon or large intestine. A tube where waste from digested food moves through the body.

In RDS, the premature baby's lungs don't produce enough of an important elastic substance called surfactant. Surfactant allows the newborn's lungs to expand properly and stay inflated when the baby takes the first breaths of air after birth. When premature delivery can't be stopped, most moms can be given medicine during the week before delivery to hurry the production of surfactant in their infant's lungs and help prevent RDS. Then, right after birth and during the first two days after, artificial surfactant can be given to the baby if needed. Although most premature babies who lack surfactant will require a ventilator (breathing machine) for a while, the use of artificial surfactant has greatly decreased the amount of time that infants spend on the ventilator.| |Respiratory failure||Respiratory failure occurs when the lungs do not properly exchange gases.

Using hand and foot pedals, the surgeon's movements are translated into real-time actions of three robotic arms \u2014 one holds a camera/fiber-optic light and the other two arms hold tiny instruments at their tips. The advantage of this technique over conventional laparoscopic surgery is that the robotic arms give surgeons more degrees of motion than the human wrist, which allows them to perform procedures that require very intricate maneuvers and complex suturing. As with conventional laparoscopic surgery, your child will have a smaller scar and is likely to recover faster after surgery with less pain \u2014 and less need for narcotic pain killers that may have unpleasant side effects. In addition, children who have minimally invasive surgeries typically have shorter hospital stays. R| |Robot-assisted surgery||Also called robotic surgery. Procedures done by a surgeon who uses hand and foot pedals to move robotic arms that hold a camera, light and tiny tools.

There are several self-limited focal epilepsy syndromes, which usually begin in childhood. The most common is self-limited epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes. It affects 15% of children with epilepsy and is the most common cause of seizures in school-aged children. These seizures usually last 2 minutes or less and cause twitching, numbness or tingling in the face or tongue. Some children have drooling and problems with speech. The seizures can spread and become generalized seizures. Many children do not take medicines for the condition because they have few seizures, usually at night.

The advantage of this technique is that surgeons don't need to cut through as much tissue as when they make a longer incision using traditional \"\"open\"\" surgery. This means your child will have a smaller scar and is likely to recover faster after surgery with less pain \u2014 and less need for narcotic pain killers that may have unpleasant side effects.
