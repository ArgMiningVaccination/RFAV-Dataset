Teachers, parents and other eligible people can take precautionary doses, he said. Currently, nearly 80% of children between 15 and 18 years have received at least one dose of the vaccine, whereas 56% are fully vaccinated. Among adolescents of 12-14 years, 58% have initiated vaccination with the first dose, whereas 14% are fully jabbed with two doses. Cautioning against the sub-variants of omicron, the PM said they can create problems. The sub-variants are causing surges in many countries. He said India has been able to deal with the situation better than others. Still, in last two weeks, increasing cases in some of the states show that we need to stay alert, he said. \"Our scientists are continuously monitoring the national and global situation. We have to work on their suggestions with a pre-emptive, proactive and collective approach,\" Modi said. Home minister [Amit Shah](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/amit-shah) spoke about the recent increase in Covid cases in some states and underlined the need to follow test, track, treat, vaccination and ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour. Modi called for coordination between states and the Centre and focus on boosting medical infrastructure. \"We have to implement our strategy of test, track and treat equally effectively. In the current situation, it is necessary that we have 100% RT-PCR test for patients admitted in hospitals who are serious influenza cases,\" he said. The PM said during the third wave, India witnessed up to three lakh cases per day and all states handled the situation while also allowing social and economic activity to continue. This balance should be maintained in future strategy too, he said. "}
