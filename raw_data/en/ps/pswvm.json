Stefanie's autoimmune disease depleted her energy levels, had a low immune system which caused her to be on multiple rounds of antibiotics every year. Now, her mind is more clear, her hair is healthy and growing, her skin is smooth and bright, and her joints are not sore. She has been antibiotic free for over a year now! -Stefanie Dahlya finds holistic ways to help people in recovery. I love her energy and wanted to book a session. In the 90 minute session, I felt I had done so much more than typical therapy, much more than I anticipated. Holistic medical care is so different than what I am used to and would recommend booking a session with her. -Barbara As a college student Jenna felt overwhelmed, sad and discouraged by school, work & life! Since starting the 12-week gut protocol Jenna is happy, excited, feels amazing and has significantly more energy. She feels more like herself than she has in years!! -Jenna Owning our story can be hard but not nearly as difficult as spending our lives running from it. Embracing our vulnerabilities is risky but not nearly as dangerous as giving up on love and belonging and joy\u2014the experiences that make us the most vulnerable. Only when we are brave enough to explore the darkness will we discover the infinite power of our light. -Brene Brown Get instant access to your FREE Body Image Upgrade by entering your "}
