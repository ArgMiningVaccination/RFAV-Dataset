Conditions Treated Reviews \"Thu is amazing, the quality of care is bar-none. As a veteran I have sought various types of treatment for service connected conditions. Since she is A VA choice provider I have access to great alternative forms of care that is covered by the VA. She also has additional treatments that are cost efficient and better than any medication I have used particularly for pain and inflammation. No side effects, only great pain relief. Her bedside manner and sincere care for her patients shows with the high quality experience I get with every visit. I recommend to anyone. Veterans only need to call Tri-west and get a self referral for acupuncture and request her as a provider. You won't regret it. Thank you Thu, can't wait for my next visit.\" - Johnny G "}
